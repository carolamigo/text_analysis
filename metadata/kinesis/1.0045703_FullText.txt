I have learnt and  accomplished a lot both professionally and  personally. Creating a venue for Jewish  women to express themselves is vital. Unfortunately, we are often silenced and not  given a space to speak out as Jews. Anti-  Semitism is often overlooked and many  Jewish women feel afraid to speak up when  they are affected by it.  The article on Bat Shalom, a peace organization in Israel, made me think about  my responsibilities as a Jew in the Diaspora  in regards to the Middle East crisis.  The articles written by Ashkenazi,  Sephardi and Mizrahi women gave voice  to the diverse experiences of being Jewish.  It is important to dispel the stereotypes that  all Jews are white, rich, loud, etc   I am also grateful to the women who  participated in our discussion on Jewish  identity. This talk was very insightful and  helped to create, within me, a sense of Jewish community that I have not felt in a long  time.  Although we have tried to represent a  broad spectrum of Jewish women, we are  lacking in articles written on working class  Jewish women and women with disabilities.  All the articles we received were great  and I thank the women who contributed  and shared their work with us. They forced  me to challenge my own assumptions that  I held about being Jewish.  I hope that this issue creates awareness  about Jewish identity, helps to foster Jewish pride and strengthens our community.  I also hope that it implores people to examine their own stereotypes that they hold  about Jewish people. It is crucial that we as  Jews act as allies to all women facing different forms of oppression but it is also  important that non-Jews recognise Jewish  oppression and work as our allies as well.  It is necessary to remember that although NorthAmerica has been a place of  refuge for many Jews we need to recognise  our own responsibility in the continued  oppression of Aboriginal peoples.  Thanks again to all the writers, Kinesis  staff, volunteers and especially to Amal.  Also, thank you to my Nana who taught  me the value of sharing stories. Shalom!  — Lisa Wulwik  As Kinesis goes to press, I am struck  by the importance of making connections  between different communities and what  we see as our 'issues'. The murder of a  young SouthAsian woman, biocolonialism  of Indigenous people's knowledge and  DNA, racism against domestic workers, the  Palestinian/Israeli 'situation', the rise of  Anti-Semitism, discrimination against  Mizrahi, Sephardic and other non-  Ashkenazi Jews, homophobia in the Jewish community, and the continued oppression of Aboriginal peoples...what is the  common thread that binds such seemingly  disparate issues? Why are some of these  topics being covered in this special edition?  The answer lies perhaps in more questions.  Why are we not able to understand that all  oppressions-no matter how different-are interconnected and mutually reinforcing?  Jews have a long history of social action and civil disobideance that has made  itself visible through various civil rights,  peace, labour, anti-racist and other movements. It is crucial that we reclaim this history by participating at rallies to protest the  incarceration and imminent deportation of  Fujianese refugees, at the various protests  and hearings over traditional territories of  Aboriginal peoples, at the trial of the youth  who senselessly beat a young SouthAsian  woman to death and at the various other  vigils, rallies and protests that we consider  to be of "no direct relevance to the Jewish  community."  All of these issues are relevant to us as  Jews and as a socially conscious people  who have survived genocide, ignorance  and the continued hatred that we face today. The fight for Indigenous sovereignty  and against biocolonialism is especially relevant to us as a community that has sought  and found refuge on land that belongs to  Aboriginal people.  We have to travel in both directions. It  is my hope that this issue will not only  empower Jewish readers, it will also inform  and convince non-Jewish readers to stand  up as allies to Jewish people. Anti-  Semitism, learning about different Jewish  realities, understanding how we view our  Jewish identities and how anti-Semitism  hurts us...these are not just 'Jewish' issues.  Allies have to meet each other half-way and  it is time that Jewish women receive the  support we need in order to become visible in feminist organizations.

Thanks to:  Masoud Azarnoush * Helen Babalos * Tanya De Haan * Erin Graham * Marion  Pollack  When Jewish women speak out against  Anti-Semitism, we need our non-Jewish,  feminist sisters to recognize how they can  oppress us and thank us for having the  courage to speak out about a reality that is  often invalidated and overlooked. Many of  the pieces in this issue are by Jewish women  of color due to a conscious effort on our  parts to challenge what is often seen as an  Ashkenazi hegemony in Jewish media and  literature. I send out a special appeal to my  non-Jewish sisters of colour to stand behind  Jewish women-especially those of us who  are also of colour-and help us build the alliances that are so desperately needed.  While guest editing this issue, I have  often felt forced to choose between my identity as a woman of colour and my Jewish  heritage. There is no choice. The reality is  that I am both and this is the theme that  draws all the pieces in this issue together:  Jewish women cannot be viewed through  a narrow lens. We are complex. We are lesbians, we are poets, we are rabbis, we are  single mothers, we are orthodox, reform,  conservative, secular, passionate, beautiful  and above all else, we are strong and proud  survivors. So, to all my Jewish sisters who  contributed to this issue: here is testimony  and tribute to your beauty. Thank you and  enjoy. And to all other readers, I hope this  issue will be a platform from which you  can become both informed and active as  allies to Jewish women. We welcome you  into this rich-but by no means exhaustive-  glimpse into our world.  My thanks to all the women who  worked tirelessly to produce this issue. A  large thank you to Georgina Farah, Jenn Lo,  Tara Ross and Carla Greif. An equally big  thanks to my co-editor Lisa Wulwik and to  Loolwa Khazoom for providing numerous  valuable contacts.  — Amal Rana  Spring is here! Adar (Jewish month  February 7-April 5) is here and Nissan  (April 6-May 5) is just around the corner. While the weather brightens up and  the tulips push their lovely green buds  through the soil we here at Kinesis have  been busy preparing the April issue.  This issue, is the first of its kind and  we're extrememly pleased to present  you with the first ever Jewish Women's  issue. This year we've had a string of  topics covered beginning with the fabulous Native Women's Issue, Black History Month, International Women's Day  and now the Jewish Women's issue. We  are extremely pleased to welcome the  two Jewish guest editors, Amal Rana  and Lisa Wulwik who have nurtured  this baby from start to finish.  Amal and Lisa have both been actively involved with Kinesis's past productions. Amal is the Production Coordinator (needless to say production  went smoothly) at Kinesis and shared  with us her rich Jewish culture and community. Wearing her many hats, Amal  successfully juggled the challenges of  editing with coordinating production  and scheduling volunteers. Whew!  Amal, goddess of juggling, also came  through with tasty Jewish Knishes,  which we all can't get enough of now.  Her wisdom and talented eye for editing pulled together all the many rich  herstories.  Lisa comes to us from her many  projects within the community and  shared with us her stories and wisdom  of Ashkenazi culture. She brought enthusiasm, vitality (with the odd hoe-  down) and her love for trucks. Don't  ask. At 23 years old, Lisa sure has it together and we thank her for her devotion and creative input to this issue. Superstar!  A big round of applause is due to  all the many new writers who contributed their works and poems. Although,  poetry is not standard in Kinesis we are  happy to make an exception as much  of our herstories are held within poems.  This issue couldn't have been done  without all of you!  On a special note, we'd like to thank  Sima Elizabeth Shefrin for contributing  pictures of her beautiful artwork which  appears throughout the issue. Sima  Elizabeth Shefrin is the artist/coordinator of the Middle East Peace Quilt and  a facilitator for Jewish identity and anti-  Semitism workshops. Speaking of  workshops, we'd like to acknowledge  and thank Fay Blaney, Homalco Nation  and Meera Shah for facilitating an anti-  racism workshop for VSW volunteers  and staff. Their wisdom and experience  allowed us to keep unfolding the layers of oppression that have marked all  of our lives. Erasing our ignorance is an  ongoing journey. Having said that, we  look forward to dialogue and new learning around anti-racism, anti-Semistism,  ableism and many more!  Don't forget our partee on April  7th, 7pm here at VSW. We think this issue will be a treat in itself and look forward to continuing the dialogue with  Jewish women. Our next production for  the May issue will begin on April 17th  so be sure to send us your feedback, letters and looovvve by the 14th! Happy  Passover!!!!  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Excerpt from Bad Sheet Date by Sarah Hunt  (printed in Kinesis February 2000)  Marg Scott at the Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre sees the Bad Date Sheet as a great resource  for women who access the centre. "It is good in terms  of tracking [violent men]," Scott said, "and it is an  empowering way for women to act after a bad experience, by writing up the incident and warning other  women." However, Scott fears the Bad Date Sheet is  not reaching the most vulnerable women. DEYAS  and PACE outreach workers need to ensure that the  women who are not able to access drop-in services  receive the Bad Date Sheet. In the Downtown  Eastside sexual and physical violence is a daily reality for most women. The Bad Date Sheet is an essential resource and as Scott said, "it is ultimately  other women who are going to keep women safe  down there."  T  Kinesis: Thanks to Sarah  Hunt for writing the  story and thanks to  Marg Scott for pointing  out an editing error.  Re: "Bad Date Sheet" by Sarah Hunt  I am writing to clarify my comments to Sarah Hunt regarding  DEYAS' Bad Date Sheet. While I did express my impression that  the Bad Date Sheet does not necessarily reach the most vulnerable working women in Downtown Eastside (DTES), I did not  make the following comment: "DEYAS and PACE outreach workers need to ensure that the women who are not able to access drop-  in services receive the Bad Date Sheet."  I recognize that DEYAS and PACE outreach workers and other  DTES workers work very hard to build relationships with working women in DTES. It is not for lack of trying that some working  women don't have access to the Bad Date Sheet. There are many  reasons why working women do not seek out help and information, and part of outreach work or any work with women, for that  matter, is respecting women's choices about what they need and  want. As well, the better part of the issue of women's access to  information and services is the difficulty of providing services (with  very limited resources) to a large number of women with complex needs; a struggle that most DTES agencies share.  The responsibility for this barrier to DTES women accessing  services, safety information and healing resources can be squarely  placed where it belongs, with the misplaced priorities of our elected  representatives. We all share a responsibility for speaking out about  that.  I hope this clears up any confusion which may have resulted  from the above comment implicity attributed to me.  In solidarity,  Marg Scott  Downtown Eastside Women's Center  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 News  by Georgina Farah  Racism covered up  A young girl is dead, each suspect is  pointing to the other and nobody seems to  know why such a brutal attack happened  in the first place. Reena Virk was viciously  murdered by a group of teens more than  two years ago. The only motive offered in  the killing is that several teens were angry  with her for taking an address book and  one girl accused her of stealing a boyfriend.  Of the eight teenagers implicated in the  case, Kelly Ellard is the last one to be tried.  Ellard is being charged with beating and  eventually drowning Virk in November of  1997.  Virk was asked to meet the teens by  the Craigflower bridge in Victoria, BC.  When Virk arrived, it is alleged that Ellard  began the assault on the girl. When asked  why she (Ellard) threw the first punch,  Ellard responded that she was trying to  protect her friend who had just put out a  cigarette on Virk's forehead.  The group of teens swarmed Virk,  leaving her with multiple head injuries.  Virk managed to pull herself up and walk  across the bridge. According to the other  teens' testimony, Ellard and Warren  Glowatski followed Virk across the bridge.  The next day Ellard is said to have told  another girl that she thought she might  have killed Virk. There were also reports  that Ellard bragged about having beaten  and drowned Virk that night.  Final arguments were given but the  jury has not yet made a ruling. There has  been no analysis around the power, privilege and the hatred that led to Reena Virk's  death. Numerous questions have come up  since Virk's death. Was the murder a racist  crime against a young woman of colour?  According to local teens, Virk was also rumoured to be possibly bisexual or lesbian.  What other motivations lay behind her  death?  The mainstream media has consistently pointed to rising female teen violence  as the only answer to these questions. Yet,  the real reasons why Virk and other  marginalized youth are consistently targeted within the school system have yet to  be established.  Low income women  bear the burden once  again  Once again, the federal budget sorrily  overlooked women's needs. Paul Martin  did the usual consultation with certain  women's organizations but made it abundantly clear that women are not a priority.  This budget was dedicated to a particular  segment of the population that neither  needed the boost nor deserved it.  The Liberals doled out $58 billion in  tax cuts, much of which favours the  wealthiest individuals in Canada. Corporate tax rates have been reduced by 7% and  the surtax on high incomes was eliminated:  Middle income earners were accommodated some tax relief, although women in  the lowest income brackets continued to  bear the burden of government neglect.  Although the federal government distinguished between what the market can  do and what governments should do for  people, Finance Minister Paul Martin made  it abundantly clear token relief was the order of the day for women and children. As  Kim Brooks, fiscal policy analyst for the Na  tional Association for Women and the Law  (NAWL) put it, "This is too little, too late."  Martin increased the Canada Child Tax  Benefit slightly. However, most provinces  claw back the benefit from social assistance  payments. "[Ijt's still inaccessible to the  women and children who need it most."  Provinces like Ontario deduct the benefit  from the cheques of single mothers on social assistance" said Joan Grant-Cummings,  president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women.  The Liberals did increase the Child  Care Expense Deduction for parents of children with disabilities, along with reiterating their commitment to Employment Insurance parental benefits.  Grant-Cummings also pointed out that  the 70% of part-time working women will  not be able to access the EI benefit, along  with the growing number of self-employed  women.  Author Armine Yalnizyan stated that  the Liberal government's course of tax cuts  and weak social transfer payments (funding from the federal government to the  provinces) will only serve to widen the rapidly increasing income gap. "Tax cuts aren't  the solution because tax cuts aren't the  problem. Tax policy is not a substitute for  social policy. A tax cut will not buy us better hospital emergency services...keep our  kids' schools from closing...raise the incomes of the poorest Canadian families  who don't have taxable income."  Women have been demanding an increase in monies to social services, shelters,  welfare payments, unemployment insurance, training programs, childcare and  housing. Grant-Cummings also expressed  her outrage over the lack of homelessness  funding. "The $750 million to go to solving the homelessness crisis is like spitting  in the wind—we need $3.5 billion it wasn't  even close!"  Where is the funding for family, immigration and refugee legal aid? Where is  the allocation of the promised $50 million  to grassroots, feminist services that deal  with violence against women?  A small concession was given to health  and social transfers. Canada's healthcare  and education was given an additional $2.5  billion. This amount won't even bring  healthcare and education (not to mention  welfare) back to levels in place before the  1995 budget cuts. At a time when healthcare  is in a deep state of crisis, the government  continues to derail it by offering inadequate  transfers to to provinces. Libby Davies, a  Vancouver MP reflected, "For every dollar  in tax relief, only 2 cents will go to health  care...only 9 cents will go to kids. [This]  government...lacks vision and political  will."  When we reflect on the weak Liberal  commitment to the National Childcare program, the words "why are we waiting?"  spring to mind. We wonder if Paul Martin  knows the tune.  Theft of Indigenous  peoples' knowledge  and DNA  The theft of Indigenous people's DNA,  knowledge and the destruction of  biodiversity in their communities were the  issues addressed at the recent  Biocolonialism forum in Vancouver. Debra  Harry, Northern Paiute from Pyramid Lake,  Nevada, spoke of how Indigenous peoples'  DNA is systematically being appropriated  by western scientists under the guise of dis  ease research. Harry told a packed audience, that DNA research on Indigenous  peoples is just another form of colonization  and that the 'researchers' agenda is DNA  ownership, not cures.  This latest, worldwide wave of colonization targets Indigenous peoples for control of their communities, lands and ultimately their lives. Harry emphasized that  genetic colonization is all about profit and  control, while Priscilla Settee, Cree from  Northern Saskatchewan, recounted the  harsh impact of western forms of 'development' on the biodiversity of Indigenous  lands. The panel discussion was moderated  by Viola Thomas, Secwepemc Nation, the  president of United Native Nations.  With permission of speakers, speeches to  be printed in upcoming issues  New home for Co-op  Radio home  Alternative radio station, Co-op Radio,  has at last found a new home within the  Downtown Eastside community in Vancouver. The peeling wallpapered walls of the  Sunrise Hotel will be renovated to house  not only the radio station, but a medical/  dental facility, a laundromat and a cafe. Coop Radio was given money from the city  and a provincial "Community Spirit Grant"  worth over $150,000 towards the permanent home.  Co-op Radio aims to create a collective  and inviting design that has 'street presence' and wheelchair accessibility. The radio station, which has been around since  1975 was operating out of an old building  without security of tenure. Volunteers have  kept the radio running for 25 years and are  looking forward to the station's new space.  Protesters demand  rights for Filipino  women  Vancouver, B.C. - Deported Filipino  nanny, Leticia Cables, was denied by Immigration Canada to meet with her supporters at the Vancouver International  Airport as she left 'voluntarily' for the  Philippines.  Ms. Cables' supporters, made up of  Filipino organizations, community  members, and promoters of social justice, were set to show support for her  decision to leave for the Philippines instead of undergoing further harassment  from Canada Immigration. However, in  much the same way Immigration would  treat a dangerous criminal, Ms. Cables  was kept from seeing her supporters and  closely monitored.  This denial to meet with the Filipino  community was one last kick goodbye  for Ms. Cables and yet another last slap  in the face to all Filipino women suffering under the Live-in Caregiver Program.  Ms. Cables came to Canada over 3  years ago as a live-in nanny through  Canada Immigration's Live-in Caregiver  program (LCP). She ended up working  in Edmonton, Alberta for a lawyer as a  live-in domestic worker. After 3 years of  perseverance, Ms. Cables finished her  contract under the LCP.  But as her dream of making a better  life for herself in Canada came closer to  realization, she was cruelly slapped with  an order of deportation when she applied for permanent status—her crime:  working too hard.  In violation of the terms of the LCP,  Ms. Cables worked for more than one  employer at a time. For this crime, Ms.  Cables has been deported. On average,  live-in caregivers will earn minimum or  even less than minimum wage—barely  enough to survive on. Yet, under the  LCP, the women are not even allowed  to augment this meagre earning by taking on other work.  To show their support for Ms. Cables' ordeal, and their disgust at Canada  Immigration's unjust and inhumane  treatment (not only of Ms. Cables but of  all Filipino women brought into Canada  through the LCP) the Filipino community asked to meet with Ms. Cables at  Supporters of Leticia Cables protest for  her 'voluntary' deportation  the airport. However, they were abruptly  denied and shuffled aside by Immigration officers. In response, her supporters  staged a protest in the Immigration office chanting: 'Let us see Leticia NOW!'  Instead of heeding the community's  demands, Immigration treated her supporters with the same disrespect as they  treat Filipino women. They waited until  they were sure Ms. Cables boarded her  plane, then the Immigration manager informed the supporters of her departure.  Despite the fact Ms. Cables made the  hard decision to voluntarily leave the  country (she even bought her own  airplane ticket) she was kept from the  public.  For the Filipino women and community, Ms. Cables stands as a symbol  for the tens of thousands of Filipino  women who are disposable in the eyes  of Immigration Canada.  Currently, there are close to 90,000  Filipino women who work as domestic  workers in Canada. The LCP was established in 1992. Since this time, Canada  has seen a marked increase in the  number of Filipinos fulfilling the federal  government's need for a cheap substitute  for a national childcare program. Yet,  along with this increase in numbers,  there is also a marked increase in the  abuse and exploitation of Filipino  women. The LCP exploitative and slavelike conditions leave domestic workers  vulnerable to all forms of violence and  abuse.  For this reason and for the sake of  ending violence and abuse, the Philippine Women Centre holds that the LCP  must be scrapped and domestic workers granted landed status.

KINESIS  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 What's News  compiled by Georgina Farah, Joanna  Lemay and Aseefa Merali   Hate is not a parental  right  The British Columbia Teachers Federation (BCTF) voted in favour of gay/straight  alliance clubs in schools. Teachers came  under fire from some parents for encouraging and endorsing safe spaces for lesbian,  gay, transgendered and bisexual students  within schools. Some right wing parent  groups fear their children will become homosexuals if the clubs are created. One of  the opposing groups went so far as to label the clubs as a gay propaganda machine.  Penny Priddy, Education Minister,  backed the BCTF with this statement, "I  support any initiatives that make students  who are gay or lesbian, transgendered or  bisexual feel safe and comfortable in their  school." Priddy also referred to the fact that  lesbian, gay, transgendered and bisexual  students have a very, very high suicide rate.  Violence in BC schools has come under the  blanket term "bullying" and has failed to  address the causes of oppression. Recently,  14 year old Hamed Nastoh died after jumping off a bridge—he had been taunted and  labelled as gay by other students.  Although gay/straight alliance clubs  are intended to protect students from harassment and allow for discussion on queer  identities, the Surrey School Board has just  passed a motion to create 'guidelines' for  all school clubs. This comes after the SSB  lost an $800,000 court challenge to remove  books on gay and lesbian families within  the school. The guidelines of the new club  policy have yet to be disclosed.  Women win 23 year  old discrimination  case  A settlement worth $746 million Cdn  has been awarded to 1,100 women in the  U.S. who filed a discrimination lawsuit in  1977. This is the largest job discrimination  settlement in U.S. history and sends a powerful message to employers. Women filed  the lawsuit against the U.S. Information  Agency (USIA) and Voice of America - two  independent federal government agencies  that encourage American interests overseas.  The case was launched when Carolee  Brady Hartman applied with the USIA as  a writer. She was told by the editor that they  would not hire her because they were look  ing for a man to fill the position. In some  cases, officials of the agency had forged test  scores of men to avoid hiring women  whose scores were higher.  Emergency  contraceptive pill  available over the  counter in B.C.  B.C. will be the first province to offer  women access to the pill without a prescription. Pharmacists are following the example of their neighbours in Washington State  where they learn how to assess women who  need the pill, when to refer women to a  doctor and how to look for signs of physical and sexual abuse.  Despite the prospect of more control  for women regarding their bodies and their  health care, there is deep resistance to the  program. Anti-abortion activists and some  pharmacists are in opposition to the pill.  Disturbingly, the Canadian Pharmacists  Association is revising its code of ethics to  allow pharmacists who disagree with the  pill the right to refuse dispensing it. However, the new code will require pharmacists  to refer women to another pharmacist who  feels "comfortable" distributing the pill.  According to the B.C. Medical Association Journal, approximately 30% of Canadian women will have an abortion at  some time in their lives. Within B.C., 23%  of pregnancies result in abortion and are  the most frequently performed operation.  It has been suggested that the limited access that some women have to the "morning after" pill. Various national organizations are collaborating with Health Canada  to make the morning after pill available  without a doctor's prescription. This emergency method of preventing the fertilization of a woman's egg consists of four low  dose birth control pills, followed by a second dose twelve hours later. The treatment  must be taken within three days of having  unprotected sex. It has been found to be  effective 75-89% of the time and its side effects consist of nausea and/or vomiting.  ^  Same sex benefits  exclude marriage  Bill C-23, the Modernization of Benefits  and Obligations Act has been passed to accord gay and lesbian couples the same benefits as heterosexual common law couples.  The bill will amend 68 federal statutes including the Old Age Security Act, the  Canada Pension Plan as well as tax obligations and benefits under the Income Tax  Act. The legislative changes did not include  a definition of marriage.  However, Justice Minister  Anne McLellan recently introduced an amendment to  the legislation to adopt  a    'one    man,    one  woman' marriage definition, banning same  sex couples from legal  marriage. Several provinces are already changing their laws to comply  with the Canadian Char-  ter    of   Rights   and  Freedoms.  New home  Pap test  A new study is underway to  develop a home Pap test. Dr. Ruth  Martin, an instructor at the University of British Columbia has been  conducting tests to develop a Pap  test that women could administer  to themselves rather than having  to go to a doctor. The test would  allow women to obtain cells from  the cervical wall, mount the cells  on a slide and send it off to a  laboratory for testing. Dr. Martin feels that there are many  women who avoid Pap tests because of the intrusive nature of the procedure and that women would, in fact, prefer to use a home Pap kit.  Pap tests (short for Papanicolaou) were  designed to screen for cancerous cervical  cells, which can be treated if detected early  on. In Canada, over 1500 women are diagnosed annually with cervical cancer; about  500 women die each year from the cancer.  news by  for  about women  wnrreire  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Movement Matters  Women speak out  against Taliban  compiled by Georgina Farah   Women for Women in Afghanistan  (W4WA) is hosting a fundraising dinner for  women in Afghanistan.

I had to go - the words on the poster  jumped out at me, saying it is time to rejoin your sisters, rejoin the action, get involved, get excited - so I did! I began marching at 11 years old at an anti-nuke protest.  Lately, I had been feeling tired of it all; the  marches, the petitions, the speeches, the  seeming lack of any real change. I even  missed last year's Take Back The Night  march, after faithfully attending for 12  years. Women were still being beaten in  their homes, children were still being raped  and I was still angry. I retreated. I stopped  volunteering, I didn't belong to any women's organizations, I stopped reading the  newspaper and I didn't attend any rallies.  I became a feminist hermit (what an  oxymoron), however, the retreat and rest  were healing and needed.  But the work still needs to be done. My  sisters still need my anger and I still need  theirs. So I took the day off work and  South Asian women march in support of International Women's Day.  headed out to the Art Gallery where  women were already gathering for action.  I had my camera, my reinduced and of  course, my boots for marching. Women  were everywhere and more kept pouring  in. There was an undercurrent of excitement moving through the milling crowd. I  spotted a woman I knew from Rape Relief  and we greeted each other with joy. She was  busy giving out red and purple coloured  balloons: the official colours of International Women's Day 2000. Aboriginal  women were drumming - drumming us to  awareness, calling out to the women in the  ever-growing crowd. An Elder said a  prayer and the march began. Suddenly we  weren't milling about anymore. We now  had a purpose - our energy became focused, our laughter, determination, courage and strength embraced us. This incredible energy drew us along, joyously winding its way throughout the march. It triumphantly led us and it protectively encircled  us. Hundreds of women smiling at one  another, shouting out fierce chants, holding hands, wheeling wheelchairs, pushing  strollers, carrying banners, marching. We  called out our defiance, our demands: no  more poverty, no more violence, no more!  We were angry and determined but we  were also proud and celebratory. Look at  us all! Women of all colours and shapes and  ages. Hundreds of thousands of women all  over the world that have changed so much  and continue to change so much. Despite  violence, hunger, bombs and rape; despite  all the crappy systems we live and work  in, all the fucked up 'isms' and phobias.  Despite all of it, we're still here!  The hundreds of women flowed by me  and encircled Library Square (where several federal government departments are  located). We completed the circle and gathered in front of a small stage. Some tinny  music was playing, there were media people milling about and cops were standing  across the road. That was all irrelevant - our  focus was here with each other. I saw several more women that I knew and we  greeted each other with hugs and smiles. I  was moved by the silent cutouts of women  protesting for our sisters behind bars. An  eagle flew overhead. A sea of red and purple balloons billowed above the crowd  while an Aboriginal Elder began the  speeches with a prayer.  I realized I was part of an awesome sisterhood of women, mothers and grandmothers marching behind me while I was  marching on the path of young women  marching us into the future. Marches make  a statement, they make us visible, they are  an action that inspires us to other actions.  But, it's not only about great marches and  fine speeches. It's also about women finding each other, linking up, discussing, supporting and acting together. One small step  here, one small step there, one letter here,  one released woman there, one law  changed here, one woman safe there...  Towards the end of the march, I was  able to meet up with a group of women  from the SouthAsian Women's Center. We  talked, argued, laughed, and planned all  afternoon. International Women's Day  March 2000 inspired me. My sisters encouraged and strengthened me, and once more,  I'm ready for action!

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  A Bene Israel cradle ceremony:  An Indian Jewish ritual  for the birth of a girl  by Flora Samuel  The following article was originally  published     in  Bridges:     A  Journal for  Jewish  feminists  and  (palna) is decorated with  flowers, and the baby  wears new  clothes   and  ornaments.  O   n  this oc-  reading  R i v  k  a  Rosenwine's  article about a  new American Jewish ritual for naming a  baby girl, I was prompted to  write this article so that more people will  know about the unique way in which the  Bene Israel community of India celebrated  a girl's birth by adopting a Hindu custom.  The Bene Israel perform a ceremony,  called barsa, at home on the twelfth day after the birth of a girl or a boy. On that day  the child is introduced to his or her cradle  ceremoniously in the presence of guests,  mostly women and children. The cradle  name,  whereas a boy  has received his  name earlier at the brit  mila (circumcision). The  girl's naming ritual is performed by the  child's aunt or another lady. She holds the  baby in her arms, blesses her, whispers her  new name into her ear, then places her in  the cradle. Around the baby in the cradle  are arranged portions of boiled chick peas,  sweets, and other foods to be distributed  among the children. Women sing lullabies  to the child. The mother sits on the bed  rocking the cradle. She also wears new  Never Buy Tampons or Pads Again!  -Small rubber cap worn internally  ^u£^ -Sanitary & reliable        -Comfortable, easy to use  t|v      -Lasts at least 10 years -Safe for overnight wear  -Great for sports, camping, backpacking, swimming.travel, overnight  wear, etc. -Accepted FDA 1987, Health & Welfare 1992  -No more pads or tampons to pack  -No more worries about running out of supplies  "This is a hidden treasure.

After the songs, the portions of sweets  are handed to the children, but the children  have to act as if they are stealing the portions. An elderly woman stands to the side  with a kind of cloth belt to pretend she is  giving blows to the children, who try to  avoid them. This, in my opinion is a farce  to represent the mischievous behaviour of  the Hindu god Krishna, who used to steal  butter from the gopis (milkmaids) when he  was a child. This represents a kind of wish  that the child will be full of pranks and not  just a block of flesh and blood. The guests  then bring gifts to the newborn baby as well  as to the mother and the party goes on.  The gifts that the mother receives are  accompanied by a tray full of almonds,  dates, sweets and coconut. The idea behind  these ingredients is to make the mother eat  preparations which they believe help her  to have enough milk in her breasts. The  mother picks up the coconut and while she  is sitting on the bed, she pushes it back under the bed between her legs. She is jokingly chided by the other ladies to push it  as far back as possible so the next pregnancy  won't be too soon.  The Bene Israel of India, who lived  among the non- Jews, adopted this barsa  custom not as a religious custom but as a  pleasant social one. When a Jewish male  child was born his first encounter with outsiders came on the day of his brit mila. This  ceremony, however, took place at the synagogue, so only Jews were present there.  Now what about the non-Jewish neighbours and friends who wanted to see the  newborn and bring him presents?  So the Bene Israel found this cradle custom handy. Like their Hindu neighbours,  they held it on the twelfth day following  the birth. (Among the Hindus a woman is  considered impure for ten days after the  birth.) The Bene Israel ceremony resembles  that of the Hindus except for the religious  rituals. A Jewish child is put in the cradle  with the words "beShem Adonai" (in the  name of the Lord).  For the 1995 exhibition on Indian Jewry  at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, the Indian Women's Organization of Lod coop-  Uassage Therapy Cranial Sacral Therapy • Energy Balancing  oefcAjra  £ healing centre  10-2495 Commercial Drive 6 Broadway      Telephoi  251-6879  erated by videotaping some of the religious  and social customs of the Bene Israel. A  small group enacted the barsa ritual for the  opening celebrations of the exhibition. The  Indian Women's Organization of Lod was  founded in 1969 and has been responsible  for preserving and presenting Indian Jewish culture in Israel. I am one of the founding members of the organization and for  the last few years I have served as the coordinator and advisor. When Mrs. Delia  Worms of London saw one of the photographs of the cradle ceremony, she came  running to see me saying, "We the western  people consider ourselves progressive and  advanced but we never give a girl the importance you Indians did by this ceremony."  By celebrating the barsa for girls as well  as boys, the Bene Israel took the opportunity to celebrate a female child's birth publicly. The recent ceremonies oibritha or bat  mitzvah for girls were unknown in India.  When I read the article by Rivka  Rosenwine, my thoughts went along with  her. I also felt elated at the birth of my  daughter. I am a mother of three children,  two sons and a daughter. They all love, care  for and respect me equally and I have given  equal love and care to them and am equally  proud of their achievements. But the birth  of a daughter added a dimension to my life.  I can't help thanking God for making me a  woman as He wished, and for blessing me  with a daughter in addition to my two excellent sons.

In 1939, Shanghai was the only place  to which Jews could still escape without  much money, a visa, landing permission,  or other documents. The Germans still released Jews if they had proof that they  were leaving the country. My father was released from Buchenwald and my mother  from prison; they were permitted to take  with them the equivalent of $4 and no jewellery. They were thoroughly searched before embarking.  A committee of Central European Jews  who had settled in Shanghai earlier met the  new refugees upon arrival. They had organized huge dormitories where 50 to 150  slept in one room (no flush toilets) and provided one hot meal a day. After a week my  parents found a room, which they shared  with three others. When they finally found  a room to themselves, that they could afford, they fled because the bed bugs were  unbearable. They ended up in a house with  20 rooms and about 50 people, and the  luxury of flush toilets. When I went to  Shanghai with my mother in 1982, we actually managed to find the building. It was  still standing and had been turned into a  school. We went inside and I saw the small  room where my parents lived during most  of their stay in Shanghai.  Many Chinese had come to Shanghai  from the countryside fleeing from the Japanese. Conditions were very crowded and  there was tremendous poverty. Stealing and  begging were widespread. They could not  afford funerals and one would find bodies  wrapped in straw mats on the street, which  were picked up as garbage by big trucks.  Garbage was not regularly collected, however, and my parents always had cats to  help control the rat population. It was far  too expensive for individuals to boil water,  so there were hot water shops where they  sold thermoses of hot water. Once in a while  my parents bought a whole bath: a 'coolie'  would come with two large containers of  hot water, which were poured into the tub  and cold water  was       added.  Since this was  such an expense,  my mother took  a bath first, then  my father, then  my       mother  washed    their  clothes in it, and  finally washed  the floors and  toilet with that  water.  Work   was  difficult to come  by, but after a  while my mother  managed to find  a job as a secretary-bookkeeper  making $10 a  month. They still  got one hot meal  a day from the  Committee and  they had to sell  many of the possessions they  had brought  with them to  make ends meet.  The dormitories, kitchens, and hospitals established by the European Jews were maintained with money sent by American Jews.  After Pearl Harbor many businesses closed  and the flow of American money was cut  off. It was the Jews who fled Russia in 1917,  who had established themselves in Shang-  They could not  afford funerals  and one  would find  bodies wrapped  in straw mats  on the street,  which were  picked up as  garbage by  big trucks.  hai and accumulated some wealth, who  were able to help continue financing these  programs. My mother was then out of a job  and joined those working for the administration of the dorms, kitchens and hospitals. Although there was no money, at least  they got food.  Altogether there  were about  20,000 European  Jewish refugees  living in Shanghai at that time.  In 1943, under pressure  from the Germans, the Japanese (who occupied Shanghai)  ordered all Central European  Jews into one  district, later  called The  Ghetto. They  could only leave  this section with  special permits.  This northern  part of Shanghai, Hongkew,  had been occupied by the Japanese since 1932.  Many areas had  been destroyed,  so the refugees  lived among the  ruins. Then America began bombing Japanese installations around Shanghai. Thousands of Chinese were killed as well as a  few hundred European refugees. In the  meantime, it was somehow arranged for  American Jews to send money via Switzerland or Sweden for the upkeep of the dorms  and kitchens. If it had not been for those  kitchens, many Jews in Shanghai would  have starved. My mother then received a  salary of about $7 a month, which, with the  extreme inflation, meant she needed a shopping bag to carry her salary home.  During the war years it was the Red  Cross that managed to get messages in and  out of war zones. That was how in 1942 my  mother heard of the birth of her half sister  in America and the death of her other sister in Ravensbruck.  There was great rejoicing when the war  was over in 1945, although, because of a  raging typhoon, the Americans could not  land for two weeks, and until then the news  was not verified. However, the Japanese  sentries who patrolled the Ghetto disappeared. Then the horrible news of the holocaust hit and the refugees were stunned.  When the American soldiers were sent  home, the US army hired local civilians. My  mother landed a job and actually made a  decent salary. It took another two years  until all the formalities were settled and my  parents were able to come to the US (with  financial aid from American Jews). There,  my mother was reunited with her father,  stepmother, and her new sister.  Many of the Shanghai refugees came  to the US after the war and formed a social  organization. Many of those friends have  since died, but the organization is still going on, made up mainly of those who were  in Shanghai as children. In 1997 my parents attended a Shanghai reunion. They  were probably the oldest survivors attending.  Madeline Helga Zadik is a Jewish Lesbian  daughter of holocaust survivors, who lives, gardens, and creates art in western Massachusetts.

Life for  me     started  here, in a clinic  of the plush  quartier du Belvedere, only a  long      walk  from   where  c^     I'm seated at  |      an    outdoor  I     cafe boulevard  ^      de Tunis. Three  k      months later, I  xj      was   yanked  |^    away never to  return   until  now, August  1992.  But, like a cat who knows her mistress's  voice, her smell, the touch of her skin, my  body remembers, lingers back on the cafe  chair and lapses into rare calm; which opens  up - to the incessant movement of people  strolling down the esplanade that divides up  the boulevard, with no aim other than to  stroll at dusk in the direction of the sea,  chatting with family and friends; to a  whiff of jasmine, sold at every street corner, tied up by brown-skinned vendors  into neat bundles that men wear behind  the ear like others a pencil or a cigarette.  My body remembers, feels no fear, not  an ounce of worry, as I enter the souks  through the tamedPortede Tunis and walk  resolutely forward, while my mother,  born and raised in this city, keeps repeating: "[w]e should head back, we're going  to get lost."  Somehow, I feel more confident than  in any other unknown city I've visited.  Some ancestral knowledge, perhaps  passed down by my great-great-grandmothers who spoke no language other  than Judeo-Arabic and wore chechias on  their heads Arab-style to cover their hair,  is guiding me. My desire to explore, to  get inside the belly of the old city, is more  compelling than any apprehension I  might have of getting lost in the maze of  narrow streets or harassed by the all-male  merchants.  A feeling is pulling at me that I  wished for but didn't really expect to  have: these streets belong with me and  me with them, even though Tunisia will  never belong to me. Most Jews left in the  late fifties and throughout the sixties no  longer welcome once national independence had become a reality. The lone Kosher butcher we passed this afternoon  made my heart ache. My mother and I  looked at each other but said nothing.  Still, in spite of the butcher's sorrow,  and my own, at a past irrevocably gone, a  way of life I'll never have a chance to experience firsthand, the joyful sense of being  in the right place wins out, along with a  feeling close to invincibility that comes as  a complete surprise to me. I'm walking in  my ancestors' footsteps; generations of  Smadjas were born here and lived here. I'm  certain for now that I am out of harm's way.  I feel safe, at peace, at home.  Years after this one visit back to the  motherland, I will reflect upon the peculiar experience of exile: that of being forced  by the tyranny of geography and foreign-  ness to shed my original skin, to cover it  up with layers of others, to forget it at times,  only to discover in the wondrous simplicity of clear blue skies against white-washed  walls, in the muted tarn tarn of a derbouka,  in the fragrance of jasmine on a summer  eve, that this first skin of mine, the one I  was born with, will always be the one that  clings to my bones.

Bonding between Jewish women:  Happy Kwanzaanukah  by Nikola Maria Marin  I was having a slow day at work. I decided to surf the internet and to do a genealogy search on my father's last name—  Marin. As I was scrolling down a list of  names, I saw my mother's maiden name  on a list of Jewish families that migrated to  the Caribbean, along withDfl So and Sos and  the Thingezes.  I called my mother that night and told  her the news. "Whatever," she said, which  made me think of the piled up Jewish moments in my life.  My dad—who is in his fifties—and I  are finally penetrating the shield of idiotic  anti-Semitic jokes. We laugh at the jokes  now, not at each other.  I also know that my mother has a Jewish thang.  When my black friends, Jesse Jackson,  that college professor and "whatever"*  make anti-Semitic remarks, I am embarrassed for the whole damn community.  White Jews dismiss my Judaism or say  [screwed] up white people things.  When I tried to lodge a complaint about  anti-Semitism, I was asked if I was sure it was  anti-Semitism. I guess naggers are supposed  to be sweated and black Jews don't know  what anti-Semitism really is.  While I am told that I am the exception  to the all-of-them-are-bad rule, it still bites,  because I have to witness the violence and  survive it too, smoldering away silently.  I see Jewish blood tendrilling over the  surface of the earth, popping up like the  changing faces in a Michael Jackson video  collection. Popping up out of nowhere, out  of everywhere, a many-headed beast.  My upbringing allows me to focus on  the bonds between Jewish women (and men),  rather than a rigid notion of what a Jewish  upbringing is. It has been a project of mine  to document these lingual and non-lingual  bonds in photography, writing, and video.  As a mixed race/mixed blood chameleon,  my bonds with my Jewish sisters and "whatever"* have been complex and sustaining in  my life. A real blessing to come together, having been outsiders.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Anti-Semitism uncovered:  Smashing silences  by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin   For days I've been struggling to write  this article on Jewish visibility and anti-  Semitism. It's a subject I understand well.  I'm a long-time Jewish activist, working for  Jewish pride and visibility, against the oppression of Jews, and for a just peace in the  Middle East for both Jews and Palestinians.  But doing research on anti-Semitism makes  you tired. This week it's been hard to put  any heart into my words.  Finally, I give up and go to a movie.  "Lucie Aubrac" is playing at the Vancouver East Cinema. Lucie and her Jewish husband Raymond were resistance fighters in  France during the nazi occupation. When  Raymond is arrested and condemned to  death, Lucie engineers his escape by convincing a gestapo officer that Raymond is  her fiance, that she is pregnant, and must,  artwork by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  for the sake of her reputation, marry him  before he is executed.  I happen to know that this is a true  story. In 1943, Aubrac was an active and  trusted member of the French resistance,  fighting to save her country. But she was  also a Catholic woman who displayed great  courage to save the Jewish man she loved.  Suddenly, I remember why I am writing this  article.  I love being Jewish. I love being part  of a people who have a rich culture and history that spans thousands of years, a history of learning, strength and survival. I  love being part of such a diverse people,  rooted all over the world, of many  ethnicities and nationalities.  I love the religion, with its many  branches and degrees of observance. Although I do not actively practice it I know  it is the basis of the culture and values with  which my life is entwined, including a basic Jewish value of healing the world. Perhaps this is why a disproportionate number  of Jews have always been active on the left,  in the communist party, in the women's  movement. This, despite the fact that the  left has rarely taken a stand against the oppression of Jews.  Anti-Semitism has many similarities to  racism but it also has differences. Historically, anti-Semitism has been cyclical, with  periods of relative safety following periods  of terrible oppression. During the good  times, misinformation and stereotypes have  been kept alive so it would be possible to  use Jews as scapegoats in times of crisis.  Over the centuries Jews have been expelled from many countries. During the  Middle Ages, Jews—who were not allowed  to own land or practice most professions  —worked as tax collectors. While this was  happening, anti-Semitism would continue  to simmer and when the peasants rebelled  against over-taxation, their anger would be  directed at the most visible agents of the  oppression, the7ews.  The Holocaust, the systematic killing  of 6 million Jews in the Second World War,  was also the destruction of our languages  and vibrant cultures. It has left unimaginable scars on Jewish communities which  we are still working to heal.  What does the oppression of Jews look  like today? What is it about? Due to its cyclical nature it is sometimes invisible to  people who are not Jewish: part of the oppression is that others cannot see what is  only too painful and obvious to Jews. It's  about the fact that you can live for years in  the lower mainland and not be aware of  the Jewish community. It's about the amazingly prevalent myth that all Jews are rich.  It's about the fact that most of the doctors  shot at by anti-choice extremists are Jewish. It's about North Shore columnist Doug  Collins and others like him who deny the  Holocaust in the face of overwhelming  documented evidence and painful memories. It's about members of the Chassidic  community - Orthodox Jews who are very  out about their Judaism - being routinely  harassed on the streets. It's about the extensive vandalism last year in a Winnipeg  Jewish cemetery. It's about the burnings of  American synagogues. People forget that  the white supremacist movement does not  consider Jews white. In California a man  walked into a Jewish community centre and  shot five people including small children.  He said this was a wake up call to America  to be on guard against the Jews. Yet still we  have to argue to prove the oppression exists.  The women's movement has also experienced its share of anti-Semitism. Until  the mid-Seventies, while many Jewish  women were committed and active feminists, they didn't particularly identify as  Jewish feminists. At the 1975 Mexico conference, marking the beginning of the  United Nations International Women's  Decade, the resolution, "Zionism is racism"  opened the door to extensive anti-Jewish  attitudes. In her book, Deborah, Colda and  Me, American Jewish feminist, Letty Cottin  Pogrebin, documents comments from that  conference as extreme as, "The only good  Jew is a dead Jew".  In the early 1980's, in Vancouver and  elsewhere, Jewish lesbians and feminists  started to address the anti-Semitism in the  women's movement and come out as Jews.  We refused to stay quiet any longer or to  let Jewish oppression be seen as less important than other oppressions. Yet even today it takes tremendous courage for Jewish women to speak out publicly as Jews.  A history of oppression makes people  afraid. Much Jewish immigration to  Canada has been to escape danger and severe oppression. Jewish babies are born into  a delicate world of fear. Even in families so  assimilated that the children grow up not  aware they are Jewish, the fear gets passed  down from generation to generation.  For Jewish women, there's a particular intersection between sexism and anti-  Semitism that hits us hard, making us feel  bad about ourselves and our bodies. Like  many lesbians, Jewish women don't fit the  stereotypes of femininity. Like many gay  men, Jewish men don't fit the stereotypes  of masculinity. In addition, for Jewish queer  people, the way homophobia operates is so  reminiscent of anti-Semitism, it adds another layer to how scary it feels to be out in  the world.  Since you can't get through life being  that terrified all the time, we get good at  functioning on top of fear, sometimes without even knowing it. But fear can make us  feel mistrustful, or isolated, or make us  become invisible as Jews. Internalized oppression makes it difficult for us to confront  incidents of anti-Semitism, especially since  the fact that no one else seems to notice  them makes us feel like we're crazy.  The oppression of Jews is hurtful to  everybody. The damage that holocaust de-  niers like Collins do is parallel with people  trying to tell us that there is no sexism in  our society, or no racism, and that any way  we feel bad is just a personal problem; a  figment of our imaginations. Holocaust denial is not just damaging for Jews, it's damaging for everybody.  I started out speaking of Lucie Aubrac  as an ally to Jews. Many gentiles hid Jews  during the holocaust at tremendous personal risk. Children of nazis and children  of Holocaust survivors have met in Germany to do healing work. Before the 1985  International Women's Conference in Nairobi, African-American and Jewish women  worked together to take a stand against  both racism and anti-Semitism.  In the last two decades Jewish feminists have learned to take pride in ourselves  as loud, proud Jewish women. We have  refused to be invisible. We have learned to  speak out and insist on being heard. We are  learning to connect with each other in support and trust. We are learning how to work  with our allies in this project we share: to  build an oppression-free world in which we  can all truly live with equality, respect and  dignity.

Despite the numerous articles, commentaries and books on this  topic, many people tend to be intimidated  by the complex history and the numerous  different points of views that exist. Social  action can not take place without knowledge. We hope that the following information will inform our readers—both Jewish  and gentile—and provide them with a platform from which they can start working  for a just peace for both Palestinians and  Jews in the Middle East. We caution readers that due to the complex nature of the  Palestinian-Israeli situation, the following  information cannot encompass all points of  view, due to space limititations. However,  it is our hope that future issues will include  more articles on this topic, from all the different perspectives.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000  KINESIS Feature  Mixed-heritage musings:  Seeds of doubt:  constructing a Sephardi  identity  by Sandra Haar  This excerpt first appeared as a larger piece  in Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists  and Our Friends, Vol. 6, #2, Summer 1996.  It was subsequently published in Canadian  Woman Studies/les cahiers de la femme,  Vol. 16, #4, Fall 1996. It otherwise remains unedited as per the author's request.  Perhaps, it should be enough to say  that i am Jewish. On the thin surface layer  of reality, my mother would have insisted  so. But even as a girl I could make sense of  the other truths, that the surface reality hid  and protected. This is my dilemma. One  part of my Jewish identity is seen to be definitive of "Jewishness," the other is ignored  or derided. The stories I am about to tell  are my attempt to reassert my Sephardic  identity, to trace its history, to insist on the  place of that history in and among other  histories and realities.  My mother Yvonne and her cousin  Helene came to Canada in 1956 on student  visas. Yvonne was 21 years old. The same  year, in Egypt, 10,000 Jews were stripped  of their citizenship and expelled. Some Jews  were killed or imprisoned. Two years later,  my mother's family was expelled. They  were dispossessed, given 72 hours to carry  their belongings out of Egypt. Valuables  were confiscated at the border, so members  of my mother's family paid other (non-Jewish) Egyptians to carry these items - necklaces, jewels - out for them. They arranged  to meet outside in Italy, France, and Switzerland. In certain instances they never saw  these carriers again. It was a risk.  From 1948 to 1967, the year of my birth,  the Egyptian government carried out a systematic program to eliminate Jews from the  state. First the Jews were thrown out of  government jobs and positions, then children were not permitted to attend state  schools. Professionals lost their licenses to  practice, then Jews could not own the principal share in any company. Activists and  community leaders were imprisoned, without trials, on the accusation that they were  Zionists. The Egyptian government commenced a program of the "Arabization" of  Egypt, expelling residents without Egyptian citizenship, for the most part, Armenians and Greeks. Before 1958, my mother  was an Egyptian citizen, as was her mother  and her mother before that. But Jews were  not part of the new program, not Arabs.  The Jewish community of Alexandria,  in which my mother was born and grew  up, was an elite community. Her world of  private schools, beaches, and parties, was  demarcated, always with the awareness  that it could be encroached upon by the others; the general population of the city and  its streets—poor, "dirty," Arabs. The history  of the elite in Egypt follows from the history of colonization. As the French colonized North Africa during the 19th century,  there emerged a class of citizens who began to speak French and who acted as an  intermediary class between the Arabs and  the French. My mother's family were merchants in the cotton trade between southern Egypt and the fabric industry of France.  They dressed, spoke and behaved as the  French did. As in other colonized countries,  there was a correlation between class, education, skin colour, and language. Yet the  older traditions would sometimes resurface: my mother points out in a family photograph from the 1950s, a man who is still  wearing a tarboush, in the Arab custom.  For the Jews of North Africa, of the Islamic lands, entrance into the colonial structure provided liberation from the anti-  semitic laws and customs and an avenue  to European modernity. These laws and  customs included mandatory dress or  markers on clothing, public humiliations,  and differential civil rights that varied in  time and from place to place. Following the  creation of the state of Israel in 1948, the  Jews of Islamic countries, like those of  Christian nations, would be automatically  linked (in the minds of nationalists) in allegiance to the Zionist nation. Cultural intermingling existed concurrently with prohibitions, special laws and taxes, and codes  of dress that paralleled the situation for  Jews in the Christian countries of Europe.  In recent centuries, the situation worsened.  During one of the wars between Israel  and the Arab countries (it must have been  1967), my father Isaac was working as a  general contractor in Hull. A co-worker  who knew Isaac's wife was Egyptian asked  if there was conflict between him and his  wife. I can see again my father's frustration as he tells the story, why this man  couldn't understand that his wife is Jewish  and so is he, and therefore, for him, there  was no issue whatsoever. He was infuriated at his co-worker's inability to comprehend, even to ask such a question.  My father and mother were married in  Montreal in 1964. In arranging the documents for the marriage, the rabbi accepted  my father's Jewishness without question,  but had serious concerns about my mother's identity. This was an Ashkenazic rabbi  in an Ashkenazic synagogue. Montreal's  Sephardic community was, at this point,  still very small. And, my mother did not  have a Hebrew name. What allayed the  suspicion of the rabbi was Yvonne's recitation of her parents' names: Esther and Alfred Isaac. The wedding could proceed. I  am reminded of an Ashkenazi friend whose  community would have used the term  "mixed marriage" to describe this.  Within Israel, ethnic groups are designated by the state as "European" and "Oriental" (which is sometimes replaced by  "African" and "Asian"), placing the groups  in political relation to one another. Within  the Middle East, to do this is also to draw  upon the power relations that are the legacy  of colonialism. Ashkenazi Jews have become "the Europeans;" Sephardic, "the  Orientals." So, the divisions of Europe, Asia  and Africa have been reproduced within  the Jewish state, as within the Jewish world  of the diaspora. In a Jewish context, my  mother becomes the Arab to the  Europeanness of the Ashkenazi. However,  among Sephardim there is another division: one of class, education, language and  skin colour. My mother's family would not  exist in the same conceptual "place" with  most Sephardim in Israel.  The difficult position I am placed in  with respect to Middle East politics, as a  Jew with roots in that region causes me apprehension about discussion of Arab/Jewish politics. In these cases, "both" Arab and  Jew is a contradiction and as such indicates  a difference from the "Arab" position  (which assumes that you are not also a Jew).  I am told, reminded, over and over: regardless of how similar a Jewish culture is to its  surrounding culture, regardless of the level  of participation, or how long the co- existence, that we are from there, but not of there.  Sephardic Jews are those Jews that  trace their origins to Spain before 1492. This  is a standard definition. Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, some  migrated northward into Holland and later  England, while the majority settled in the  lands of the Mediterranean. Middle Eastern and North African Jews, generally, have  been described as "Sephardic." The origins  of Sephardim begin at the point of exile  from the Iberian Peninsula, which had been  reconquered by Christian forces. Thus began another diaspora within the overall  Jewish diaspora (70A.D., from Judea/Palestine).  Moving out from that singular point  of exile, that event of expulsion, when along  with 3 million Moors, 300,000 Jews - those  who had not converted to Christianity  (whether in name or in practice) - took their  belongings (what had not already been  plundered), and left, by order of Queen  Isabella. Also moving out from that historical and geographic point, are Jewish communities scattered throughout the Christian  and Islamic world, consisting as well of  Jews already living in these regions. Leading up to this point, these Jews were existing in a society that was culturally and politically dominated by the Moors of Africa  and the Islamic religion, and marked by the  co-existence of Christians, Muslims and  Jews. For the majority of Jews resettling after the Expulsion, this African/Arab/Islamic context remained consistent.  In tracing the lines of influence, I am  led not only to an examination of Arab/  Jewish relationships, but to an awareness  of the complexities of theArab/African relationship and where "Jewish" fits into that.  As difficult as it is to bring together the  strands of "Arab" and "Jewish," the African influence has been even more effectively denied and removed from consideration in popular and academic discourse. I  am trying, here, to recover some fragments.  The Expulsion was part of an overall  attempt on the part of powerful forces in  Christian Europe to remove all traces of African, Islamic and Jewish influence from  society. And while African scholarship  would have inestimable importance in the  European "Renaissance," its antecedents  were denied.  TheArab, Jewish, African influence on  Southern Europe became despised and submerged - whether this influence was evident culturally or physically.  The Arab and African influence  emerged through our bodies, though not  in uniform ways. However, the specificities  of our bodies were eclipsed by the stereotype of the Jewish body. In Europe,  Ashkenazim were/are thought to be identifiable by the (Arab and African) signifiers  of the "frizzy (Jewish) hair" and the  "hooked (Jewish) nose," among other traits.  In pseudoscientific circles Ashkenazim  were stigmatized, thus, as "carriers" of African blood, and as "impure." Many fictions  are created by what we look like, through  family and through race. In Mein Kampfi  Hitler was very clear: the Jews are responsible for bringing Africans into the  Rhineland. He didn't mean it literally; it  was an issue of race, of blood. Still, stories  are told to emphasize certain "bloodlines,"  and others are moved to different locations.  see SEPHARDI next page  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  artwork by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  from SEPHARDI previous page  I didn't grow up with "Sephardic" as  a primary self-identity: I had no hesitation  identifying as Ashkenazic; the culture, history and philosophy were mine. This has  as much to do with the dominance of  Ashkenazim as the Jews (in NorthAmerica)  as with the particulars of my family history and dynamics within it. Add to that  the virtual absence of Sephardic cultural  and political reference points available to  me. Also, within popular stereotype, I  "look" Jewish, that is to say Ashkenazic.  Because I am not seen as "Sephardic" in  Jewish circles, unless I verbalize that identity, I could ignore that fact in a way that if,  say, my skin was a darker colour or I looked  more like my mother, I could do less easily.  I know which of my features are from  which "side," but no one outside my family knows that.  When I'm asked, "Where are you  from?" I want to answer, "How far back  do you want to go? Egypt, Poland, Turkey,  Austria, Italy, Spain... and beyond that?"  The "origins" of a diasporic, migratory  people necessitates the long answer. Few  stay around to listen. In and of ourselves,  Jews are a mixed people. As often as not,  Jews deny this, and cling to our apocryphal  unity, even though it should be clear that  though we might have started in the same  place, we've adapted, assimilated and ac-  culturated. As a collectivity and as individuals we embody layers upon layers of  "mixing."  I grew up hearing cries of bastal and  santa maria\ (and the half-whisper la polizial)  from my mother. I revelled in the power of  these secret words that formed part of a  repressed history, existing below the surface of the everyday. The Spanish words  transformed into Judeo-Spanish, Ladino,  and carried across southern Europe, across  history, as we went into Turkey. I remember her baking a meatloaf with a cooked  egg in the middle of it, and wanting not  the ends, but the middle with its concentric circles of yellow, white and brown, a  polpetone, that was, like her surname, Cori,  evidence of the Italian history. Layered onto  that is the French, the most recent and therefore dominant addition.  Being mixed, that is, from two people  having separate, specific identities, offers  a unique perspective. "Ashkenazi" will  never be synonymous with "Jewish" for me  because I've always had another perspective. It's a perspective that permeates my  understanding of what comprises "Jewish": I'm always aware of the often partial,  inaccurate use of "Jewish" to refer to  Ashkenazim only. Being "mixed" has also  prevented me from rushing wholeheartedly, nostalgically into "my past history."  Any attempts are cautiously tempered with  the knowledge that it is a partial history. It  is at these moments of caution, suspicion,  and doubt, as well as insight and perspective that I feel "both"—Sephardi and  Ashkenazi—and not (as is more often the  case) one or the other. Like others, I seek to  transform this tattered fringe of the Jewish  community that I hang onto into a place of  strength, connecting errant threads from  other places, cultures and traditions as  well—those of mine and those of others.

Thinking of Cochin [South India],  where I lived so long ago, the Jewish section had a unique atmosphere which I can't  forget, with its own sights and sounds and  smells. There the Jews lived for more than  400 years and there is nothing that has not  happened there, except murder. So I think  that I should put down more of my feelings about the atmosphere of that town  where I and my ancestors were born and  bred (like all the Jews there) up until recently when there are no Jews at all.  In fact it is not an entire town, only a  street, but we called it Jew Town. In that  small town there were three synagogues  and three Jewish communities. There was  no need for the Jews to go out far away from  Jew Town as we had everything we needed.  Near the northern end of the street  were the little shops where we bought all  the necessary things for cooking. These  shops mostly belonged to Hindus who  lived a few kilometres to the west. There  was a clothes shop, a toddy shop, an opium  shop and a charaya shop where they sold a  drink made from the bark of a palm tree.  This drink was like arrack, and they sold it  retail by the ounce. In this area there was  also a betel shop, and a barber shop where  the men went to shave their heads and  beards. Women had no use for barbers as  they always grew their hair, the longer the  better.  The shopping area ended where there  was a lane going towards the west and the  new Jewish cemetery. A few yards further  south was another road connecting the  town to the main road in the west, and at  the end of the connecting road is the old  Jewish cemetery. Even after death we didn't  have to leave the place. Apart from the people who lived there, there were also ghosts  and mischievous spirits called Kapiris,  which I have written about in my book, but  I did not hear about any devils. Maybe they  could not enter the Town as it was protected  by the two synagogues at both ends of the  street.  In Jew Town, the first person who got  up in the morning would open the door  wide before she started her morning chores.  In case the door of one house was not  opened, the neighbours started worrying.  "Why did they not open the door yet?" If  any woman went on the road, people  would ask her "Where are you going?" If  they saw she was going to the hospital,  "Oh! Who is ill? What has happened?"  Then the elderly women would go visiting  to see if they could help.  For any celebration, like brit mila or a  wedding or bar mitzvah, everyone in the  community went to help decorate the  house, making the manarah (canopy) bed  specially for the wedding couple. Women  did the cooking with the help of a few  cooks, if they could afford to hire them. On  Friday the cooking was done for the hathan  shabbat celebration after the wedding. Usually the women made kubha (dumplings)  for the Sabbath afternoon meal, preparing  them on Thursday to be ready for cooking  the next day It was a hard job to make such  a lot for the whole community. Sometimes  the marriage party could not afford to celebrate on the Sabbath, but the community  did not let them down. Every family  brought the food they made in their houses  to the bride's house, bought a few bottles  of arrack, and sat singing and enjoying the  whole day, to make the bride and groom  happy. They didn't want to discriminate between rich and poor people at that time.  It was a time when we did not have  electricity and no oven to keep the food  warm for shabbat. One or two rich families  had a big oven built, as big as a room, where  they kept burning coconut shells on the side  and closed the small doors. On Friday evenings most of the Jews would bring their  food, either hammin or rice in a pot, and  keep it in one of those ovens. The door was  opened only on the next day at lunch time.  Then you would see all the people fetching the food and bringing it back to the  house as if in a procession.  The houses on both sides of the street  faced the road and there was a carved stone  lamp next to the door of every house. Each  Friday evening we would put oil into this  stone lamp and light a wick, before the  shabbat lamp was lighted inside. Walking  on the street you saw the lights on both  sides, all the length of the road. Then you  would see all the men going to the synagogue with the young children in their festive dress. At this time the women in the  houses would light the seven glass oil  lamps which hung from the ceiling, and say  the blessings. The stone lamps were lit not  only on shabbat but also on the eve of all  the feasts, and when someone had a birthday in the house.  Next morning on the Sabbath day or  festival day, the women also went to Syna  gogue. The Jewish girls had to have a piece  of garland made of sweet-smelling jasmine  flowers to put on their hair. Most of them  had long hair and they made it into a bun  at the back of their head and put the jasmine garland around it when they went to  Synagogue. After the minha prayer on the  afternoon of Simhat Torah, the women  dressed up in gold embroidered dresses to  go from the Paradesi synagogue to the  Kadavumbagam in the south. Those  women from Kadavumbagam went  through the streets all the way to the  Paradesi synagogue in the north.  It was beautiful to watch the people  coming back from the synagogue all together. From every house we heard the Sabbath or festival songs, in the night and in  the day.  In the evening at the end of shabbat the  light had to be brought back from the synagogue. Adults or children would bring  lighted candles from the synagogue after  the evening prayers were over, to light the  lamps in each house. If there was a marriage that week, the bridegroom was  brought home through the street with a  small band playing, and everyone in the  Town ran to see it.  During the festival season you could  hear all up and down the street the crowing of cocks and clucking of ducks. The  Jews used to buy chicken and ducks early  and keep them in the back yards of their  houses and feed them with oil cake bran  see COCHIN next page  KURUKKUN (a short chorus)  Obstinacy and quarrels are found throughout the street.

Yet these Jews are people  Blood of my blood,  Dear to my heart,  Grappling with the same fears.  For me the Law is one of No Return  I do not deny my mother's gentile line  But Jewish is my world by birth,  Not a state I have to earn.  What haven mine if they should come again?  I will not let you keep me from my home.  The room was thick  with damp and chill. Candles flickered softly, dripping wax on the stackable  tables scattered around the  back of the synagogue. A  friend had seen a listing for  "An Evening of Jewish Sto-  rytelling," and casually  mentioned it to me. It had  sounded like a great way to  spend a Sunday night,  though now, facing a circle  |g    of strangers, I wondered  j«    what I could have possibly  ■£    been thinking.  -§ All I really knew about  a    Judaism were the thrice a  a    year holiday events spent  •<~     with my father's family. My  ^   great uncle would sit at the  ST1    head of an extended table,  1j     reciting prayers almost un-  8     der his breath, while my  ■2     relatives shouted to each  "ft.    other over the clutter of  forks and food. I watched  the rituals like a tourist as foreign words  explained histories that I thought were not  mine.  I spent the Sunday mornings of my  childhood colouring drawings of Jesus and  hearing stories from the New Testament.  My brother, sister and I were packed off to  church with my mother each week, while  my father stayed home. I often inquired  why my father didn't have to  come."Because he's Jewish," my mother  would always reply. It was through the  weekly routine of running to the car, gobbling cooled peanut buttered toast, after the  frenzy of finding my misplaced Sunday  School notebooks, while my father calmly  pitter-patted inside the house, that I came  to the conclusion that I was not Jewish.  As I grew into adulthood, I became  aware of an immediate kinship emanating  from certain strangers or casual acquaintances who were Jewish. Strangers saw in  me something I wasn't certain of myself,  yet I began to embrace it. Words dropped  from my lips that surprised me as I too began calling myself Jewish. There was also  a declaration by an Israeli Rabbi that  Judaism can only be passedon matrilinealy;  Judaism traced from father to child is  invalid, meaningless, absurd. Truthfully, I  knew very little about the religion and  made no effort to learn more. When I was  about ten, my mother had decided she  could not live as both a good Catholic and  a good feminist and thereby marked the  end of my Sunday obligation. I had marked  myself as 'areligious', not officially a part  of any institutional clique. And being  deeply skeptical of organized religion, how  could I even think of calling myself Jewish?  As the first few tales unravelled, I  drifted in and out of listening. "And you  know of course that Jews couldn't travel  freely through Russia in those days," I  heard a storyteller say and sat in rapt attention. Earlier that week, in the back of an  overstuffed closet, I had stumbled across  an old elementary school project about my  Zada's journey from Russia to Canada. I  had written that he had decided to emigrate  because of "problems in his homeland".  "What kind of problems are you referring  to? It would be interesting to expand on  this," my teacher had commented in a surge  of red ink. At the time I hadn't known what  problems I meant, listening to stories over  a decade and a half later, some of the possibilities became clearer.  That night burst with revelations, not  just because part of my lineage shifted into  slightly sharper focus, but because, unexpectedly, I too was present in the different  talks of the evening. I was searching for a  permanent place to root and had thought  comfort would only come with the finding  of that definitive place. I realize now that  the searching itself ties me to my ancestors,  my history. It defines me. And that evening,  as the cool autumn gusts blew through the  sukkah house, and onto my skin, I felt  grateful.

A couple of weeks before Pesach and  Rosh Hashanah, people started painting  their houses. Some people painted once a  year only, before Pesach, and during that  season the whole Town smelt of paint. Just  after Yom Kippur the whole Town smelt of  fresh coconut leaves, which were brought  by one or two richer families and distributed to the people of the whole Town to  make their Succoh festival.  The natives of Cochin knew what the  Jews needed for each festival. They would  bringpomela fruits andethrogs with a stem,  and a few leaves to hang in the succoth, and  of course chicken and ducks. They called  out their wares: "Pomelas to sell! Ethrog to  sell!" all along the street, and for all these,  the Jews paid a bit of a high price. On the  eve of Shemini Atzeret there was a man who  brought jasmine flowers in chains, and a  yellow flower beautiful in color and smell  called chambagam (which I have seen nowhere else).  Even the non-Jews who passed  through Jew Town enjoyed our celebrations. After most of the Jews left Cochin,  someone wrote in a local newspaper how  he missed the songs he used to hear when  passing the Jewish street on our Sabbaths  and festivals.  One day a few years ago my sister and  I suddenly remembered a Malayalam song  which we used to sing when we were  young, joking about the rivalry between the  different Jewish communities and also  praising their beauty as they walked  through the street. This is a song which  women sang at parties during the eight  nights of Hannukah, when we would dance  in a circle and clap our hands.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  A Mizrahi perspective on the Middle East:  There's a piece  missing in this  peace  by Loolwa Khazoom  We have been forced into binarisms. Either we are progressive/pro-Arab/pro-Palestinian and thus in favour of giving up the  West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the  Golan Heights; or we are racist/anti-Arab/  anti-Palestinian and in favour of keeping  all or part of this land.  In all the analyses I have heard, from  the so-called Left and Right, hawks and  doves, there is a poignant lack of awareness of Mizrahi reality. As if the only refugees have been Arab. As if the only Jews  have been European. As if "Jewish" and  "Middle Eastern" identities are diametrically opposed. Ironically enough, although  not surprisingly, I have found Arab analyses of the situation to be as Euro-centric as  the Jewish and general world community's  analyses.  I say we put all the cards on the table.  Let's talk about all theArab-Jewish/Arab-  Israeli points of connection and oppression  and only then begin to think of how to solve  the problems in the Middle East. Without  looking at the full picture, we cannot have  integrity when addressing Arab-Israel relations. I also find that racist and anti-Jewish assumptions and attitudes are woven  into the lens through which we look at the  issues in this region.  Germany has been held accountable  for the Holocaust. It has made compensation payments to the families of Holocaust  victims and to Israel. On a daily basis in  the Jewish world, we are reminded of the  Holocaust. On the other hand, how many  people know of the daily terror Jews faced  in Iraq or Syria? How many people know  that Egypt and Morocco invited nazis to exterminate their Jewish citizens? How many  people know that 1,000,000 Jewish refugees  and their children from Arab countries now  make up the majority of the entire Israeli  population?  Mizrahi mistrust of Arab states has  not been understood with compassion, the  way that Ashkenazi discomfort with Germany has been. Along those lines, our hesitancy to give up Israeli land has not been  explored and taken seriously. On the contrary, our political stand on Israel has been  contextualized in a racist and patronizing  light. Mizrahim, we have been told, are  hawks because they are too primitive to understand the Western values of diplomacy,  democracy, and peace.  Anyone in the Middle East peace  movement would find it absurd to discuss  ^"~    '""" " "*•<*-«,;'.,.  y  Jilt:   '    Wm   iIilT y% *$■■  Mm mmim  —.    s  1  G-&\   QUf  art and photo i  Arab-Israel relations without inviting Palestinians to the table. Yet Mizrahim have  consistently been absent from such discussions. We have been unfailingly silenced by  the so-called "peace-makers", when trying  to talk about the oppression our families  faced at the hands of Arab governments.  This silencing is rooted in a complex mixture of racism and Jew-hatred.  Arab governments and international  Arab community leaders have publicly  spoken of Jews as if all Jews are European;  they have spoken about Israel as if it were  a European state colonizing "third-world  people". The majority of Israel's population is Mizrahi, indigenous to the region.  More specifically, they are refugees or children of refugees from countries currently  under Arab control. They were forced to  flee their homes of 3,000 years when Arab  states either issued expulsion orders or otherwise forced them to leave, through intolerable conditions of oppression.  Arab dismissal of the Mizrahi experience stems from anti-Jewish sentiment that  existed far before the creation of the State  of Israel. If hostility towards Israel was  based purely on the injustices that the state  inflicted on Arabs, Arab leaders could  speak about those injustices without needing to dismiss the Mizrahi reality. The two  could exist side by side.  Ironically, the State of Israel and the  international Jewish community have  helped foster misperceptions, as they too  have presented all Jews as being white  Europeans. I find Arab dismissal of Mizrahi  reality stemming from anti-Jewish sentiment, whereas I find Ashkenazi dismissal  of Mizrahi reality stemming from racist  sentiment.  Anti-Semitism is a term that specifically describes the anti-Jewish experience  facing Ashkenazim. Persecution of German, Polish, and Russian Jews was based  on the premise that these individuals were  not real Europeans; they were Semites—  people of the Middle East and North Africa. And because of European racism, people of this region were seen as undesirable  foreigners.  For centuries, Ashkenazim faced hostility, discrimination, and even death, which  were attributed to the Middle Eastern and  North African roots of the Jewish people.  For the sake of survival or status, depending on the time period, Ashkenazim therefore tried to assimilate into Christian Europe, by appearing as un-Semitic as possible.  As such, a cultural legacy was developed and passed on, where Ashkenazim  shunned the Middle Eastern and North African roots of their heritage, in favour of a  European identity. Despite the fact that Jews  lived in the Middle East for 3,000 years as  opposed to the 700 years or so that  see MIZRAHI next page  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  from MIZRAHI previous page  Ashkenazim lived in Europe, Ashkenazim  completely dissociated from a Middle Eastern and North African identity.  And so we have a crisis in Jewish identity, where anti-Semitism is itself a form of  racism, and where Ashkenazi detachment  from the Middle Eastern and North African roots of Judaism is simultaneously a  form of self-hatred and self-preservation.  For this reason, I understand how  Ashkenazi community leaders can simultaneously embrace Arab causes and run in  the other direction from Mizrahi ones. Arab  causes seem external, about someone  else. Mizrahi causes, on the other hand,  challenge the very foundations of Jewish identity and thus threaten to crumble 700+ years worth of hard labour  that Ashkenazim have put into their  being viewed as true Europeans.  Of course, this behaviour describes Ashkenazim who consciously  ignore or resist the Mizrahi reality.  There are Ashkenazim who embrace  theArab cause but not the Mizrahi one  simply out of ignorance. Because Arab  and Jewish communities have portrayed Jews as white Europeans, many  Ashkenazim have analyzed the situation through this lens; they have honourably gone beyond their own interests to fight what seems to be a racist  case of white Europeans colonizing  and oppressing "third world people".  There are also Ashkenazim who  are hostile both to Mizrahi and Arab  causes. I feel this attitude comes from  general racism towards non-Europeans. Ironically enough, with the establishment of the State of Israel,  Ashkenazim for the first time could  present themselves as true Europeans  and be the ones in power over the non-  Europeans - whether Mizrahi, Arab, or  most recently, Ethiopian. Modern European  Zionism after all, is based on enabling Jews  to finally throw off their Semitic stigma—  their Indigenous identity—so as to be considered equals among the European nations.  What about non-Jewish/non-Arab individuals? I feel that anyone who is pro-  Arab out of the positive spirit of defending  justice must embrace the Mizrahi reality  as well. The two are not in competition,  after all; in fact, there are a number of places  where they overlap.  Right now, I find there is no room for  Mizrahim to voice our mistrust of Arab  states or communities, as our mistrust is  viewed as being racist. Such a response  eradicates the Mizrahi experience of being  the oppressed group in Arab countries. It  clumps Mizrahim together with  Ashkenazim and once again portrays all  Jews as being European oppressors.  Throughout theArab world, since the  advent of Islam, Jews were treated as  dhimmis—legally second-class, inferior  people. Even in the mildest forms of discrimination, Jews were treated as subordinate and expendable and had to go through  many obstacles to achieve basic economic  survival. The yellow badge—i.e., the yel-  I find Arab  dismissal of  Mizrahi reality  stemming from  anti-Jewish  sentiment, whereas  I find Ashkenazi  dismissal of  Mizrahi reality  stemming from  racist sentiment.  low Star of David, a symbol associated exclusively with nazi Germany—actually  originated in the Middle East, where it was  used to identify and single out Jews for a  variety of discriminatory treatments.  Throughout the Arab world, governments did not grant Jews equal protection  under the law. In countries such as Iraq and  Syria, for example, government officials  randomly banged on doors of Jewish  homes, after which nobody ever saw the  families again. Gruesome torture of Jews  was also common in such countries, after  which the victims were either murdered,  permanently disabled or disfigured. Jew  ish children going to school frequently disappeared without even making it to the  ransom stage. Because of the silencing of  Mizrahi Jews, the world has not been exposed to the personal stories of people who  suffered through the discrimination and  terror that I have described.  I was not of the generation that grew  up in and was forced to flee from Iraq, but  I have been impacted directly by the many  consequences of fear and the destruction  that the Jewish community faced there.  Growing up, my sister and I were forbidden from making any sudden banging  noise. Whenever we forgot, my father was  thrown into a fit of panic and terror,  having a visceral reaction that an  Arab official was at the door to come  to do God-knows-what to the family.   My father also slept with his  shoes near his bed, unable to get over  the sense of needing to run from an  Arab mob at any time. I learned fear  of walking past an uncovered window at night; my father passed it on  from his childhood, when it was apparently unsafe for a Jew to be exposed in such a way.  A number of people around me  - family, community members and  friends' parents - have been completely unable to discuss details of  life and loss in their home countries  throughout the Arab world. The  pained silence itself has told me a  story and given me a sense of the  harsh impact of what happened to  the Mizrahi community.  The majority of Mizrahim in Israel seem to be conservative about  giving up Israeli land. I happen to  feel the same, for reasons I have discussed so far. Not all Mizrahim share  the same feelings or current political  stand. We are not a monolithic community. Regardless of our history or  politics, the diversity and uniqueness of our  voices needs to be heard in the Middle East  peace movement and in the Arab-Israeli  peace talks. The world needs to finally recognize us and take what we have to say  seriously.  Loolwa Khazoom has had her work published  in various periodicals and anthologies.

The discussion took  place over a few hours and was sustained by knishes, challah and lots of  laughter. What follows is a very brief excerpt from the original discussion.  AMAL:  Let's start by describing our backgrounds.  KATRINA: My maternal  grandmother was born Jewish. I grew up with my mother  talking about Judaism and  telling me to learn about my  heritage while warning me to  not tell anybody about it. She  was afraid of anti-Semitism  and didn't want anybody to  know that we were Jewish. On  the rare occasions that I did  open up and tell people at  school I was ridiculed, so I got in the  habit of not talking about it and not  thinking about it.  My grandmother was a Jewish  woman. She was a big part of my life. I  associated being Jewish mostly with  her and not with myself. It wasn't until  I was older and started looking for my  identity and asking what my heritage  was other than English, French Canadian and Scottish that I started looking into Judaism. My ex-partner knew  a lot about Judaism and encouraged  me to look into it. I started getting  books out from the library. What I focused on was cookbooks. I found one  with recipes and all these beautiful stories of families and their experiences.  My journey led me out of Princeton. The  next person I met who was a big influence on me was Carla, who was my first  Jewish friend. It was really fun to just  sit around being Jewish.  LISA: Both my parents are Jewish.  My family is from Prague, Poland, and  Germany. My parents were raised in religious homes. I was in Hebrew school  until my Bat Mitzvah and was brought  up with the knowledge of being Jewish. In my family we don't celebrate the  holidays and it seemed that the biggest  connection to being Jewish for me was  the holocaust. In high school, I was living in Toronto and I rejected Judaism  for a while. I didn't want to be associated with J.A.P. (Jewish American Princess). I was going to school downtown  and there were schools uptown which  had a lot of Jews in them. The Jewish  girls were stereotyped as J.A.PS which  meant they were spoilt, princesses,  selfish, rich. When I identified as Jewish I was compared to the J.A.P stereotype. I was going through a hard time  and I really resented the word J.A.P because it deligitimised the pain I was in  because princesses have perfect lives.  For a long time instead of being angry  at the stereotype and the anti-Semitism  that created it, I was angry with the  Jewish community. It took awhile for  me to re-acknowledge and have pride  in my Jewish heritage.  CARLA: I've been Jewish since I  was six months old. At that time I was  converted and adopted into a Jewish  family. My birth mother is Lebanese  Arab. My birth father is Anglo Saxon.  My parents are Ashkenazi from New  York. I found out that I was half Arab  around five years ago.  I was always proud to be Jewish. I  liked celebrating Jewish holidays; I enjoyed going to Hebrew school for a  while. I've always identified as Jewish  but have had some confusion because  I wasn't born Jewish. I've always had  the idea that I don't look Jewish or  sound Jewish. I can pass for being a  member of my family but I'm different.  I've always felt different and that's been  hard for me to understand because my  parents thought being different was a  bad thing. I think for a while I thought  it was a bad thing to be different and I  spent a lot of time trying to fit in (with  my family and my peers). I've definitely  gotten over that trip.  NIKOLA: Before she died, my paternal grandmother went to Israel and  Egypt and sent my father a dashiki. My  father looks Arab so I've always felt  this ambiguity about being Arab and  being Jewish. I ignore Middle Eastern  politics because I don't want to have  to choose sides. I've been trying to  come out of the closet for two or three  years now. I form bonds with Jewish  women. I find all these relationships to  be quite sustaining. That's how I've  managed to build community. I've gone  to a progressive synagogue a few  times. As a Black person I feel it's like  being in elementary school when  you're the only Black person and everyone else is white. It's hard for me to  participate in a scenario like this. I  . need to sit back and suss out who really is my ally. It means feeling a bit  alienated until I can really be comfortable with people who are allies not just  in terms of me being Jewish but with  me being Black and a lesbian. I do a  little two step dance sometimes because as a woman with a disability, as  a Black woman and as a lesbian I can't  afford to be everything all the time. It  makes me feel like a walking target.  TARA: My heritage is Jewish from  Austria, Russia and Poland. My paternal grandfather was born in New York  and my paternal grandmother was born  in Toronto. My maternal grandmother  was born in Poland and moved to Toronto in 1913. My mom's dad was born  in Austria and immigrated toToronto in  1911. Both my parents were born in Toronto and were raised as orthodox  Jews. I grew up reform. For me growing up second generation Canadian in  Toronto, there was a strong message  to assimilate, but at the same time to  not trust anybody who was not Jewish.  It was quite confusing. I always knew I •••I     m •• • • « • • #  C  was Jewish, and I have always been proud of this  but it has been both a hard  and exciting process of  trying to figure out what it  means to be a Jew and  what is important to me.  My  maternal  grandmother's   parents  came  from   Russia   and  Lithuania and were orthodox Jews. She converted  when she met my grandfather who was from Pakistan. He was Muslim and  brown. For these reasons  her family disowned her.  She went to Pakistan and converted to Islam out of her own  choice. Since she converted, I  have always wondered, am I  Jewish or not? My parents  raised me as a Muslim, in  Saudi Arabia. I knew I was  Jewish but the emphasis was  on the conversion to Islam.  To reclaim my Jewish roots  in that context could have  met   with   grave   consequences. I grew up internalizing   a   lot   of  anti-  Semitism. I    started reclaiming   my heritage  in   university   while  talking to other Jewish  women. I started realizing Jews weren't bad  people. I got a lot of resentment   from   white  Jews who didn't see me  as Jewish. It wasn't until  I heard a piece of wisdom  about finding out your  own identity by tracing  the stories of your ancestors that I started to reclaim my Jewish roots. I'm  finally   coming   into   my  power as a Jewish woman,  but it's still hard to do so because I find  the more I am out as a Jew, the more  anti-Semitism I get from non-Jewish  women of color.  What are some of the ways  your Jewish identity gets invalidated?  I'll say, "I've made this Jewish friend, or they just found out that  they were Jewish etc." My mother will  reply "they're only Jewish if their mother's Jewish." But you know my birth  mother isn't and I am Jewish as far as  my mother's concerned.  I first came out as being  Jewish on my father's side and I felt I  was no less Jewish. I still primarily  bond that way with his family. My father  can now say to me that he's Jewish.  TARA: Historically, Jews have been  faced with the threat of annihilation on  several occasions. It is based in this  threat that Jews decided that Jewish  identity was to be passed down through  the mother. If Jewish women were raped  by non-Jewish men, then the child's  Jewish identity would be assured. Today, anti-Semitism is kept alive through  misinformation; this threat of annihilation does not exist. It is safe for all Jews  to claim and take pride in their identity.  AMAL: we need to qualify what kind  of Jews we're talking about because in  Western discourse the people who get  heard are Ashkenazi Jews. For me it's  about racism. My grandmother was disowned not just for marrying a man who  was Muslim, but also because he was  dark. The protectiveness that comes up  around the question of who is Jewish  is about Ashkenazi Jews wanting to disassociate from their original Semitic  roots which trace back to North Africa  and the Middle East .  LISA: | remember being in Hebrew  school and I never heard about Jews  that were not Ashkenazim. As a kid  growing up I didn't question it because  it was all I knew.  When I  first went to a gay  bar I gaped at people's    faces;    the  same happened when I first went to a  synagogue. I had a stereotypical image  of Jews and I'm constantly having to  stretch that. Part of what led me to understand my own Jewishness is my  bonds with other Jewish people.  I wasn't religious and because I was away from my family I didn't  really feel like I could claim to be Jewish. A bunch of us got together, all  Ashkenazi lesbians.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Reclaiming an Egyptian Jewish identity:  Dancing with Nonna  by Joyce Zonana  It wasn't until I was  twenty-five and studying  belly dance that I learned to  listen to Arabic music. I had  ventured into the class on a  whim, led by a friend who  idolized the sixty-five year  old teacher, an American  woman married to a Moroccan man. In her bright  ground-floor studio on a  steep San Francisco hill, Violet taught us to circle our hips,  ribs, and shoulders; to close  our eyes, to bend our knees,  to open our arms—to let the  music rise from the soles of  our feet to the crowns of our  heads. Working deliberately,  with the concentration of a  priestess, she demonstrated  delicate hand movements  and deep, full-body undulations, showing us how our  bodies could register each  quaver, each beat of the pulsing, sinuous sounds. At the  end of the two-hour classes,  her husband Leo would join  us, beating his drums as we  shimmied ecstatically, wild,  open.  Before encountering Violet, I heard Arabic music only  with my mother's ears, distinguishing nothing but a  litany of loss—mournful,  harsh cries that embarrassed  and unnerved me. "I hate it,"  my mother would say, "It's  too sad."  If she could have had her  way, our apartment would  have been filled only with the  studiously cheerful sound of  1950's pop music, supplemented by Italian opera Live  from the Met on Saturday afternoons. But my mother's  authority was limited; she  was subject, even in the home  she managed so meticulously,  to the will of her mother-in-  law, my father's widowed  mother Rose, "nonna,".  Nonna lived with us for more  than twenty-five years, dominating my parents' lives from  the day of their wedding at  the Temple Ismailiya in downtown Cairo to just one year  before her death at the  Sephardic      Home  Brooklyn.  I will never know  which came first—my mother's distaste for Middle Eastern music or her conflict with  her mother-in-law. I only  know that in the tense battleground that was our  home, the music my grandmother played came to represent all that my mother  abhorred. In silent sympathy  I allied myself with my  mother, barricading myself  against the rhythms of my  birthplace, closing myself to  my grandmother and all that  she loved.  Nonna, born in Aleppo  to a large Jewish family, cherished Arabic music and insisting on playing it daily.  Each afternoon, I would find  her seated in the center of the  living room sofa, an embroidered and scented handkerchief in her hand, listening to  one of her four scratched recordings of favourites by  Fairuz and Farid Al-Atrash.  As she listened, she cried,  sighing out her grief for the  death of her husband thirty  years earlier, the dispersal of  her children and her own unwilling departure from the  homeland she had loved.  She had come to the U.S.  in 1957, not long after the  Suez Crisis led most Egyptian Jews to abandon the  country. A community of  perhaps 80,000 has today  dwindled to 200. My father  had chosen to leave in 1951;  by the end of World War II,  he had sensed that the creation of the state of Israel  would change the nature of  Jewish-Muslim relations in  the Middle East. Two groups  that had once lived together  peacefully would now be  polarized, forced by the politics of newly formed nation-  states to choose sides. Rather  than choosing Israel (as one  of his brothers had), he came  to the U.S., hoping to find the  tolerance and opportunity so  many immigrants have  sought here. Nonna was to  stay behind until we had the  wherewithal to send for her.  But the events of 1956  changed things, and my father made arrangements for  her to come immediately.  Nonna's arrival put an  abrupt end to my dreams of  waking up one day as an authentic American, blonde-  haired and blue-eyed. Her  presence became for me an  inescapable, daily reminder  that we were immigrants,  condemned to eternal difference. Nonna spoke no English; and though she could  manage in French—the language my parents used with  me—her primary tongue  was Arabic. Forgetting that I  did not understand, she  spoke to me in those strange  syllables, syllables that my  mother told me were "ugly"  and "harsh.". My mother,  though born in Cairo to a  Sephardic Jewish family with  deep roots in the Middle  East—her mother was from  Alexandria and Baghdad,  her father from Aleppo-identified herself primarily as European, thanks to the French  language and culture she  learned at the Lycee. Nonna  had come to maturity in a  different milieu, less separate  from the surrounding Arab  culture.  Nonna was old, older  than anyone I had ever seen  before—though I know now  that in 1956 she was not yet  seventy, not much older than  my San Francisco dance  teacher. Her dull gray hair  was arranged in tight ridges,  crinkled waves that seemed  a magnified reflection of the  deep wrinkles worn into her  freckled face and hands. Her  eyes were set far back, beneath a wide forehead and  behind a sharp nose. One eye  winked shut while the other  stared forward. Her body  was shapeless, tired, as if she  could no longer summon the  will to remain erect. Her thick  ankles, covered in opaque  beige stockings, emerged  awkwardly from dark heavy  shoes. Her knitted wool skirt,  with its uneven hem, nearly  brushed the floor. She appeared lopsided, wavering,  off balance. Later I would  learn that one of Nonna's  breasts had been removed, in  a mastectomy she had a few  years before coming to the  States. In an effort to hide the  gap left by the surgery, she  draped scarves across her  right side, holding her arm  across her chest when she  posed for photos.  My grandmother must  have tried to love me, her  only female grandchild in  America. But I shrank from  her clammy touch, seeking  refuge with my mother.  Nonna would run her hands  across my body, caressing,  exclaiming in Arabic words I  could not understand. I heard  her say, "Aroosa, En sha'allah  aroosa" ("A bride, God willing, that you will be a bride"),  and I cringed even more,  deadening myself in revulsion and fear.  These days my dance  teacher, Audrey, is a young  woman, not yet thirty. And I  am the older woman, just  turned fifty. At ten o'clock on  Mondays, Wednesdays, and  Fridays, a handful of us  gather in my sparsely furnished second-story apartment. It is early spring, and I  open all the windows, allowing the breeze to blow from  the screened-in front balcony  to the kitchen door at the  back. Downstairs, I leave the  front door unlocked for latecomers. After warm-up  stretches, we array ourselves  in loose chiffon skirts, tie  scarves jingling with gold  coins around our hips, wrap  veils of red, blue, orange and  green around our heads and  torsos. The music builds,  winding itself around us.  Afterwards, exhausted  and exhilarated, we sit on the  floor, stretching. Some morn-  ingsAudrey reads to us from  Rumi; on others, we lounge,  telling stories of our own.  When the women leave, I  lock the downstairs door, find  my old recording of Fairuz,  turn up the volume, and  dance awhile longer. As I  dance, I weep for nonna, the  grandmother I lived with but  never loved, a woman whose  body enclosed both the sorrows and the joys of the history I sought for so long to  deny  Joyce Zonana was born in Cairo  and moved with her parents to  the U.S. at the age of eighteen  months. She is currently an Associate Professor of English and  Director of the Women's Studies Program at the University  of New Orleans. She is at work  on a memoir, entitled Aroosa.  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Editing a Jewish feminist journal:  Challenges of difference  at Bridges  by Clare Kinberg  The following piece is an excerpt from a  longer article which was first published in "The  Narrow Bridge: Jewish Perspectives on  Multiculturalism", edited by Maria  Brettschneider.  Somewhere in between Reagan's first  election in 1980 and Israel's invasion of  Lebanon in 1982 I was sharply reminded  that the Jewish people were my "home"  artwork by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  community. At that time I was a shop steward at a coat factory. The company was  owned by Orthodox Jews, but I was the  only Jew in the union. Though my lesbianism had led me to a left wing critique of  US society which in turn had led me to  union activism, I never mentioned my lesbianism to my co-workers on the shop floor.  While working forty hours a week doing  piece work on a sewing machine gave me  a lot in common with the women I worked  with, I was also terribly isolated. The isolation peaked one day as I was riding the bus  to work. I overheard someone commenting on the headlines about the massacres  in the Palestinian refugee camps, Sabra and  Shatilla: "Never turn your back on a Jew,  they'll stab you just as quick." I needed  someone that I could talk to when I got to  work, but I knew with sickening clarity that  the understanding I needed would not be  there.  As a lesbian I felt I was, politically  speaking, spitting in the wind of nuclear  proliferation, war in the Middle East,  Reaganomics; as a Jew outside the Jewish  community, I felt terrified. Despite my own  denials, I was irrevocably a member of the  Jewish community. I thought it was possible that my own actions could have a political affect on the Jews in the U.S. At least  the Jews were a conceivable constituency.  Though as a lesbian I would still be struggling for acceptance and basic rights in the  Jewish community, in a profoundly political sense, the Jews, I knew for certain, were  my people. In 1983,1 joined New Jewish  Agenda, an organization of thousands of  other Jews like myself who had visions for  global, social and political change.  The feminists who had made it to  Agenda published an internal newsletter  titled Gesher (Hebrew for "Bridge") which  attempted to connect feminists in NJA to  let other members know, what feminists  were doing. In 1988, Jewish writers and editors Ruth Atkin, Elly Bulkin, Adrienne Rich  and I started talking about the possibilities  of expanding the Gesher newsletter to a  journal, and becoming independent of NJA.  Our intention was to be explicitly Jewish  in a multi-ethnic feminist movement. We  wanted to connect Jewish women who  were active in anti-racist, peace, lesbian/  gay, and Jewish renewal movements, and  to make connections across generations,  countries, and language.  We wanted to create a forum that  would address questions emerging again  and again in our writing, organizing and  publishing. Who are Jewish feminists and  what are we doing in our own communities? What are our goals? Who are our political allies and how do we discover them?  How do we become allies to others? How  can others become political allies to us?  These questions, and the aspirations they  imply, are embedded in the name of the independent journal we helped found in  1989: Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists  and Our Friends.  Our subtitle, "a journal for Jewish feminists and our friends," was carefully formulated to state our political intentions: to  be a journal that is proudly Jewish, boldly  feminist and accessible to our allies. At that  first meeting we drafted the Bridges' mission statement:  "The editors bring to Bridges a commitment that combines the traditional Jewish  values of justice and repair of the world  with insights honed by the feminist, lesbian,  and gay movements. We want to provide a  forum in which Jews, feminists and activists can exchange ideas and deepen our  understanding of the relationship between  our identities and activism. We seek writing which develops affirmatively Jewish  and feminist perspectives and creates links  between Jewish feminists and activists in  the broad range of movements for social  and economic justice and for peace. We are  especially committed to integrating analyses of race and class into Jewish-feminist  thought and to being a specifically Jewish  participant in the multi-ethnic feminist  movement."  Our mission stated that we were committed to "integrating analyses of class and  race into Jewishfeminist thought" because  we knew Jewish participation in broad-  based social justice movements depended  upon new thinking in relation to Jewish  identity, anti-Semitism, class and race. Still,  we hadn't addressed the fact that everyone  in our initial group was Ashkenazi and  middle class. Not until our second meeting, a year later, did a working-class editor, Tova, join the collective. Our discussions about class were not easy, particularly  for Tova, the lone working-class woman.  We did make progress, however, towards changing both how we work together and how we select and edit the material we publish. We made plans to add at  least two more working-class or raised-  poor women to the editorial group; to actively encourage submissions from working-class women; to be more conscious of  the class bias in the work we consider; to  have a working-class/poor women's column as a regular feature in each issue; to  publish a cluster of articles on class; to consider class issues in relation to promotion  and availability, and to commit the middle-  class editors to discussions of class with  women in our communities and among  ourselves.  The commitment to a "Working Class  Words" column in each issue makes us confront these issues, as a group, over and over.  For an article on how the Republican Contract with America would affect women on  welfare, I contacted a Jewish woman who  had mentioned in passing that she had received AFDC when her son was young. To  help write the article, she immediately  called up six of her Jewish friends who had  also been on welfare. All of them felt, in  varying ways, invisible in the Jewish community.  The contributions of working-class  women have affected the others amongst  us as well. The middle-class editors, for  example, have found that to keep up a dialogue among ourselves about class we have  to start with some basic questions: what is  it about being middle class that makes it so  hard to keep a discussion about class and  money going? What does it mean to "own"  middle-class identity? How does our class  affect our editorial judgment?  Bridges now has two more working-  class editors. As a group we must remain  open to fundamentally changing how we  deal with money, solicit work, and make  editorial decisions. Our specific work as  editors brings us eye-to-eye with such questions as: how do class and class-based  power inequities interact with Jewish values and experiences of education, learned-  ness, art and literature, language, immigration, community, and family? How do we  see BRIDGES page 27  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Palestinian and Israeli women reclaim common ground:  The Jerusalem Link  artwork by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  by Terry*  The following piece is excerpted from an  interview with the director of Bat Shalom, one  of two women's organizations that belong to  the Israeli-based Jerusalem Link.  The Jerusalem Link is comprised of  two women's organizations: The Jerusalem  Centre for Women on the Palestinian side  and Bat Shalom on the Israeli side. Each  organization is autonomous and has its  own activities, but together we run programs to advance peace, human rights, and  women's leadership.  The Jerusalem Link was formed as a  result of an ongoing dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women that began in  Brussels in 1989, bringing together prominent women and peace activists from both  sides. Based on these talks, a bifurcated  model was created that gives expression to  the principles of equality and reciprocity,  thereby modeling cooperative co-existence  for our respective peoples.  The two parallel centres that form The  Jerusalem Link - The Jerusalem Centre for  Women and Bat Shalom - opened their  doors in 1994, thanks to a grant from the  European Union. Each centre, however,  maintains its organizational and executive  integrity, with its own office, staff, board of  directors, bank accounts, and financial  overseeing. Some programs are run jointly  by both centres, while others are run sepa  rately. In parallel, some grants have come  jointly to The Jerusalem Link, while others  are awarded to only one of the centres.  Each organization has its own set of  challenges. Bat Shalom is considered to be  part of the peace coalition of Israeli organizations. It has a national office in Jerusalem and last year opened an office in Afula  because of the very active Jewish/Palestinian-Israeli activism in the Afula, Nazareth,  Kfar Ixel area of the country. We also started  activities last year in the Tel Aviv area. The  JCW (the Jerusalem Centre for Women)  walks a fine line between maintaining their  integrity as a legitimate national Palestinian organization and one that is connected  to Jews.  Post-Oslo partnerships are suspect because they tend to imply "normalization"  which is not on the Palestinian or Israeli  agenda. We do not speak in terms of "normalization" but in terms of "dialogue"—  the difference being that normalization  does not require the Israeli side to acknowledge the history of theother, the violations  committed against the other, or the need  for compensation to the other. Dialogue  does insist upon the above as a pre-condition for partnership.  Tern/ (last name withheld) is the new director of Bat Shalom.  A WOMEN'S JOINT VENTURE FOR PEACE:  The Jerusalem Centre for Women and Bat Shalom  We call for the struggle for justice to continue so that women  everywhere may live lives free of violence, poverty, oppression,  and racism. For us, Palestinian and Israeli women, finally ending  the occupation is a critical part of that struggle.  We protest and demand the end to the violence and oppression of Israeli settlement expansion, house demolitions, land confiscation, and all human rights violations. We, Israeli and Palestinian women, are united in a joint vision of peace and a joint struggle for justice as steps toward a future peace that will guarantee  good neighbourly relations. We call for the immediate resumption of negotiations toward a final settlement by September 2000.  A resolution of the issues of final borders, settlements, refugees,  water rights, and Jerusalem must be based on international law  and legality that will guarantee parity and a two state solution.  The vision we share as women, of a world free of violence, rac  ism, oppression and inequality, is one which is inextricably linked  to a just settlement of the conflict in our region. And may we,  Palestinian and Israeli women, then begin creating an intentional  and sustained culture of peace, with women at the heart of reconstruction and reconciliation.

Yom  Hashoah is an annual commemoration of the  Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, one of many acts of  Jewish resistance during the Holocaust.

But on Yom Hashoah,  even as I stand before you, I am not here.  Maybe I was assimilated, maybe I was underground, maybe I was outspoken. It  didn't matter. I was a Jew.  I was murdered in 1933 because I was  considered mentally defective. Maybe I was  retarded* or maybe I was mentally ill.  Maybe I was psychiatrized against my will.

I was murdered in 1935.1 was an activist who bore witness to atrocities against  the Jews. I spoke against the government  or had anti-nazi newspapers printed. It  didn't matter.

I was murdered in 1939.1 was a diabetic, but I was forbidden to buy medicine.  It didn't matter. Maybe I was a Jew.  I was murdered in 1940.1 was a communist. I was a Gypsy. I was considered  misshapen, or deformed. I was too fat to  work the way the nazis wanted. I talked  with an accent. I said maybe the Jews didn't  deserve what was happening to them. I was  gay. I didn't have a passport. I was circumcised. I was a transient. I was penniless. It  didn't matter. Maybe I was a Jew, anyway.  I was murdered in 1941. I hid in the  cellar of my good friend who had been  given all of my jewellery to pay for the trouble I caused. It didn't matter. I was a Jew.  I was murdered in 1942. With my mate,  my elderly grandparents and young siblings. I was caught trying to escape the  country. Forbidden to travel, I believed my  blue eyes and blond looks would save me  from torture and violent death.  It didn't matter. I was a Jew.  I was murdered in 1943. Along with  women and men of every physical age and  description. Of every ethical, moral, religious and cultural investiture. Of every financial status—rich as well as poor. Of  every lifestyle—lesbian, gay, celibate, prostitute. Of every level of religious observance.  Those who were good Germans, those  who never lit the Sabbath lights, those for  whom the yarmulke was critical, those who  had not known bat or bar mitzvah. Those  who were outspoken, those who were silent. Those who were strong, born destined  for longevity, those who were frail.  I was murdered in 1944 along with  those who wore their six-pointed star, those  who refused. Those with smashed windows, those who passed among the nazis  for a time. Smart ones, educated ones, university graduated ones, land-owning and  rabbinical ones. Rebellious ones, rousing,  scheming, threatening, no longer mild ones,  plotting and planning and willing to kill  ones. It didn't matter. I was a Jew. We were  all Jews.  I was murdered in 1945. Along with  one of my siblings, along with three from  the village close to ours, along with girls  whose bodies were assaulted by the nazi  guards, along with those who stole an extra bread crust to pass to a dying friend's  hand, along with those whose last rebellion was to refuse to go quietly, along with  those who raised their eyes equal to their  captors, along with those who gave aid to  a fallen friend. A Jew helped a Jew and was  murdered.  In 1945 I was murdered early in the  year, on New Year's eve, on New Year's day,  on the Sabbath, on Sunday, in the hour of  the rooster, in the hour of the owl. I was  murdered as the snow fell and again as the  first bud on the few wild flowers promised  hope. I was murdered while I slept, worked  into the 11th hour of my day. Was murdered  a few short hours from my barrack's liberation. Was murdered by the calculated  scheme of starvation, by the master plan of  annihilation, by the merest misstep, by the  cruellest of fates, by the unalterable destiny  of the past, by the whim of chance, by luck  gone awry. By the good church standing  silently by, by the refusal of others to believe, to comprehend, by the silence, by the  silence, by the long and murderous silence.  By those abroad who knew, by those who  were glad, by those who wanted proof, who  wanted pictures, who didn't care, who remained silent, who had other things to do,  who thought it didn't matter. We were Jews.  I was murdered in 1945. Before my liberation from the death camps, I was sent  marching to nowhere. I weighed less than  75 pounds. I had rags wrapped around my  feet for cover. I wore the striped cloth of  the prisoner—of the Jewish prisoner, of the  prisoner promised to death. I had tuberculosis, I had the many diseases of starvation,  I had lost my sibling, my neighbours from  the nearby village. I had no eyeglasses, no  hearing aid, no walking stick for the pain  of my hip. I was bereft of worldly goods,  of jewellery, of property, of convenience, of  health, promise, pride, pleasure. Maybe I  had will. Maybe I had faith. Maybe I had  my covenant with g-d. Maybe today I had  hopes for the quixotic maybe of tomorrow.  I have been murdered many times  since 1945. By the catholic church that aided  nazis to relocate. By the american government who brought nazis here to recommence life, yet offered fewer than 1000 refugees sanctuary. By the austrian nation who  elected, then consciously reconfirmed a  nazi criminal as their leader. By governments and individuals who were silent. By  see MURDERED next page  NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  from MURDERED previous page  governments and individuals who continue a tradition of intolerance for those  different than themselves. Upon them I bestow the mantle of shame, which is bequeathed in mourning and in rage.  Today I mourn four times.  Today I mourn for those, Jewish or not,  who were also murdered and whose names  are not remembered by anyone here. I pray  that somewhere a candle is lit in their  memory. Today I mourn for members of the  lesbian and gay community who think that  they, Jewish or not, are safe and keep silent  in the false hope of preserving that safety. I  pray that there will be someone who will  light a candle for the lesbians and gay men  who are silent.  Today I mourn for RU 20563, a genuine nazi-given number, preceded by a genuine nazi-given pink triangle. A real person  who was murdered for a commonplace life  choice among members of today's audience. Today I might look out in the audience and see Jewish lesbians and gays wearing this symbol. But many women and men  in the lesbian and gay community wear the  pink triangle with no comprehension of its  origin. In the understanding that women  always have had a level of invisibility, I believe that this number belonged to a man.  It might have belonged to a wealthy man,  one who had position and power and  maybe authority while the state allowed  him to. Today, in the Auschwitz exhibit, his  number is travelling in a display of patches  worn by non-Jews whom the nazis say  committed crimes against the state. I pray  this is the last time the death of a lesbian or  gay person is remembered by a dehumanized number.  Today as I look out among the mourners here, I do not see my parents. But I join  them in the bottomless sorrow of their loss.  I cherish, even in mourning, the names of  my paternal grandparents, Joseph and Ida,  and my maternal grandparents, Alice and  Jacob. All murdered sometime between  1933 and 1945. For my mother's family, I  carry one sister's-and my unknown aunt's-  name. Shy and comfortable between my  first and last names, she survives where the  only record I can have of her is kept safe.  For my father's family I carry the name,  never given in marriage, never altered. For  both families I carry the physique of heredity. How many diabetics would there have  been? How many would have had breast  cancer? How many would have lived to see  80? 90? How many cousins would I have  had? How many tall, short, bald, buxom,  swarthy, smart, loud, quiet, nearsighted,  proud, fat, how many cousins would I have  had? How many lesbians, doctors, scholars, teachers, mothers, authors, artists, tai  lors ... how many cousins would I have  had?  I remember in some depthless grief,  those whose names I have never heard, and  probably will never know. I mourn with all  Jews, in any station of life and in any world  setting, for the loss of the 6 million Jews,  who remain nameless at ceremonies like  today's. Today I mourn for the millions  more who lived, but did not survive. Today I mourn for the lives of Jews and Jews  and Jews ... and Jews.  *[These derogatory terms were specifically used  by the nazis to justify the murder of innocent  people by constructing them as 'abonormal'.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  The impact of WWII on Jews:  We will never forget  by Shelly Crow as told to Lisa  Wulwik   The following is an excerpt from a discussion between two Jewish women from different  generations on the impact of World War II.  Lisa: How and when did you first learn  about the Holocaust?  Shelly: I'm not sure. I was really quite  young. My first real memory would probably have been when I was in grade two.  There was a story that we were reading  about a family in Europe and there was a  little child in it who talked about having to  run away from the Germans.  Lisa: How did the Holocaust affect your  family?  Shelly: My father's family is  from Frankfurt, Germany,  and his parents, my grandparents, were killed in  Auschwitz. Many relatives  of my mother also died.  Around 100 members of  my family were murdered  altogether.  Lisa: Where were your  parents in the Second World  War?  Shelly: My mother  was born, and always  lived, in England, although her family was  from Poland. She married  my father just before the  war; he was a refugee from  Germany. He escaped Germany in 1937.  Lisa: What happened to  him once he came to England?  Shelly: He met my  mother in England and  they married, but because  she was a woman he could  not automatically become  a British subject. He had not  been in England long enough to  be a naturalised British subject and  when the war broke out he was regarded  as an alien. As an alien he had to report to  the police station on a regular basis. Then  in 1940 he was asked to report to the police  station and was told he might be there overnight. My mother did not hear from him  again for a very long time.  Lisa: What had happened to him?  Shelly: He had been sent to and interned inAustralia. He remained there until 1943.  Lisa: Did your father talk at all about  what it had been like for him in Australia?  Shelly: Yes. When I asked him directly  he talked about having a terrible time on  the ship going over to Australia. They left  from Liverpool and the captain was particularly cruel and would flog some of the  passengers and would even make some of  them walk the plank.  Lisa: Were all the passengers German  Jews?  Shelly: Yes. Only males were sent to  the internment camps. Jews from Germany  and Austria were sent to camps in Quebec,  Canada and Australia. None of them had  been forewarned about what was going to  happen.  Lisa: What happened ' 'ien your father  got to Australia?  Shelly: They were placed in a camp  that had been built by the Australians in  an area remote from Melbourne. The Australians eventually allowed them to  have contact with the Jews in  Melbourne who provided some books  and study material.  The  The changes that had happened to my  father during the war, and the murder of  his parents in Auschwitz, made him become quite negative, which affected his relationship with my mother. He was also bitter because although England had 'accepted' him, by the time his parents  tried to seek refugee status the  English government was  no longer accepting  Jewish refugees.  only  thing they  could do was  study Jewish theology and religion.  Lisa: The separation must have  been really difficult for your father and  mother.  Shelly: It was very difficult and when  my father returned he acknowledged he felt  quite different. It had been a very hard time  for him. He came back as a very orthodox  Jew. Also, when he came back he met his  son for the first time. When he had been  taken away he did not know that my  mother was pregnant.  Lisa: How do you think the experiences  of the Holocaust and WWII affected your family life and yourself growing up?  Shelly: A lot of family knowledge  about my ancestors was lost. There was a  kind of feeling of being rootless in my family. There was this feeling of being a smaller  unit without the larger extended history  that one usually has with a family.  /TV  mm  1   e   t  them in either   which   is  where his sister lived.  Therefore,    they    were  stranded in Germany, and were killed.  We also anglicized our last name because my father wanted to start up his own  business and he found it very hard to obtain the necessary papers and get the banks  support with a Jewish name. In Germany  my father had trained to be a judge but in  England he became a salesman.  Lisa: Do you feel that your sense of safety  is somewhat fragile because you're Jewish?  Shelly: My family came from Frankfurt and they had been there for several  hundred years. Although they were fairly  religious they had assimilated into society  in many ways and did not feel they would  be at risk. Germany had been their shelter  and home for hundreds of years. So when  I think about that I think that one can never  be 100% certain about the future. Here in  Canada I would define myself as a Jewish  Canadian and not a Canadian Jew, because  in times of intolerance people will just notice the label of Jew regardless of your nationality.  Lisa: Living in Canada, specifically Toronto, what would you say about anti -  Semitism today?  Shelly: It still exists today. It saddens  me when I hear stories of young people  who have become part of some anti-Semitic  group and desecrate tombstones, or you see  the sign of the swastika. Recently there  has been less and less on the news  regarding anti -Semitism but it  always goes in waves and  there is always an undercurrent of it. There  are people who are 'revisionist' historians  and don't believe in the  Holocaust and there  are others who are  firmly anti-Semitic and  who talk constantly in  terms of stereotypes.  Lisa: Have you ever  experienced anti-  Semitism personally in  Canada?  Shelly: Yes. There  are comments like,  "Are you really Jewish?  You don't appear to be  Jewish. You don't seem  very interested in food  all the time. I thought  all Jewish mothers  were always cooking  and things." There are  quite a lot of stereotypical thoughts. I also attended a club in Toronto that, three years  before I entered, had a  quota on Jews.  Lisa: As a social worker  within the school system, what do you  think are some ways people can combat anti-  Semitism?  Shelly: It is important to remember  that education is a great tool if used appropriately. As well as teaching anti-racism in  school, a section on anti-Semitism should  be taught.  The identity of Jews is often erased in  mainstream society and is left out of anti-  oppression education It is also important  to look at history and to remember not just  the Holocaust but the horrors that occurred  in Rwanda and the Balkans. We need to remember any type of threat to any race by  another race whether it be because of religion or colour— whatever the reason is—  we need to remember it so that in the future we can be more tolerant.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  A mother's perspective  Questioning Jewish ritual  by Drora  The following is an excerpt from Questioning Circumcision: a mother's perspective.  Maybe if I had been younger I would  have done it without thinking twice. I'd  never done anything "Jewish" without  thinking about it—a lot. So there I was, 40  years old, pregnant and faced with the decision of whether or not to circumcise my  baby, if it should be a boy. Not because it  was medically correct, not because I  wanted him to look like his father, but because by birth he would be Jewish. Because,  for generation after generation, to be a Jewish man is to undergo Brit Milah (circumcision)—to enter a physical covenant with  God. To be a Jewish mother is to allow this  when our male babies turn 8 days old, not  yet old enough to choose or speak up for  themselves.  Despite statements like Harold  Krushner's that, "[a boy child] does not  have to become Jewish through a ceremony", there are much stronger views that  say otherwise. They bore down on me with  all the threats of a scorned God. A big one  for me appears in the Torah, which reads,  "the uncircumcised male shall be cut off  from his people". Yes, my son would be  Jewish, but the thought that he might be  ostracized tore at my heart.  The pressure I felt was from years of  awakening in the social justice, human  rights and peace movements. As a feminist,  my values are rooted in peace, choice, community and the right to self-determination.  They are rooted in the human rights val  ues of the Jewish community, which bore  witness to those that suffered so greatly  from the anti-Semitic horrors of the past,  and continues to bear witness to the atrocities of ethnic cleansing today. How could I  reconcile these values if I colluded with the  culturally sanctioned practice of cutting off  a piece of my child's body 8 days after his  birth? Although expert mohels [person who  performs the circumcision] claim to the  contrary, there is evidence that circumcision  can cause the infant both physical and emotional pain.  Some people marvel at how the Jewish custom to circumcise lands on the  eighth day of a child's life, which miraculously is when the body's ability to clot  blood increases. From a gendered perspective, this may also be a time when it is more  difficult for a woman to gather her energy,  be assertive and demand a halt to the ritual.  When I informally surveyed women I  knew, about their experiences with their  son's bris [circumcision], I was amazed at  how many of them said it was horrible.  They were in pain for their sons, aching to  rush in and provide comfort and relief.  Some had to stay outside of the room. All  felt they had no choice but to go along with  the ritual. Why aren't we, as women and  mothers, talking more openly about this?  Contrary to popular belief, there are no  medical advantages to performing routine  circumcisions, and it is not recommended  by the Canadian, American, British or Australian pediatric societies.  Searching for information and reassurance, I arranged a visit to the female Rabbi  at the synagogue we had been attending. I  asked her if she would perform a naming  ceremony for my child if it turned out to  be a boy. She shattered my assumptions  about a woman Rabbi being more open by  saying that she absolutely would not perform the ceremony if I had not circumcised  my son. I felt hurt, marginalized and angered at her inability to see that if it wasn't  for Jews who were willing to rethink old  ways, she would not be in her position.  As my mind raced from one scenario  to the next, I carefully informed various  members of my family of my decision.  What if they were changing my son's diapers and he became aware of their shock  by what they saw? What if they rejected  him? What if he was attending kindergarten at a Jewish school and the other kids  made fun of him? What if he wasn't allowed to have a Jewish name? I was well  aware that this was not simply a decision  about my beliefs, but about my son's future.  I wonder what it will take for the Jewish community to broaden the discussion  on circumcision and to notice that Jewish  custom has already changed with the times.  Circumcision was originally a rite practiced  by Pagan tribes, and later adopted by Jews.  Originally the Jewish practice was to cut  only the tip of the foreskin, called milah.  This custom lasted about 2000 years. During the Hellenistic period, many young  Jews concealed their circumcision by drawing their foreskins forward. Some Jews  chose not to circumcise their sons at all.  Circumcision was challenged again in the  1840s during the Reform movement in Germany, when Jewish parents, physicians,  and leaders opposed circumcision. The rabbis of the time then changed the requirements of the procedure so that a circumcised male could not possibly conceal his  circumcision. This was the start of periah,  removing the entire foreskin.  So why not a more fundamental  change, a shift to a more gender-inclusive  perspective that produces practices that are  rooted in the human rights values of our  Jewish story? Surely with 613 commandments in the Torah, we can turn our focus  to those which are not solely centred on the  acts of Abraham that are intended to ritualize the patriarchal times in which he lived.  As a Jewish woman and mother, my wish  for my son is that he finds his Jewish identity in the celebration of Jewish life, community and thought, and not in a part of  his body which has been given all too much  importance.  Drora is a mother who normally writes using  her English name but would prefer to protect  her son's identity until he can enter this discussion on his own.  from BRIDGES page 23  as editors encourage new and thoughtful  writing on these issues?  Similar issues are raised by the fact that  the founding editors are all Ashkenazi, of  Eastern European or Russian descent. In  some ways, the most obvious, and the most  hidden, of "multicultural" issues for Jews  may be the differences between Sephardic  (originating in Spain), Mizrahi [Arab and  North African], and Ashkenazi [European]  Jews.  We assume that our readership includes Jews and non-Jews; Jews immersed  in Jewish learning and Jews with limited  Jewish education; secular and religious  Jews; Jews who are, and are not, familiar  with Yiddish, Hebrew or Ladino. We make  every effort to edit work to be accessible  and interesting to this diverse readership.  We italicize and define every word that cannot be found in a standard English dictionary and describe Jewish holidays and rituals each time they are mentioned. When we  publish in Yiddish, Hebrew, or Ladino, we  try to print transliteration as well as translation.  Bridges unique commitment to Yiddish  women's writing has highlighted one of the  most subtle differences among Jewish femi-  nists: there are those who relate to  Jewishness primarily in a religious sense  and those who understand Jewish identity  primarily through history and politics.  Hundreds of women were published in the  Yiddish press over the past century, and this  writing was, by definition, largely secular  and political. In addition, most of the Yiddish publications which were interested in  publishing women were sponsored by  secular, political movements. This was precisely the writing which Jewish feminists,  who look to history as their source, are most  interested in. Secular Jewish women are urgently concerned with learning about and  from the social and political lives of these  Jewish women writers and activists: their  life choices, the nuances of their political  affiliation, their real life experiences and  their insights on family, nation, ethics, and  religion. Religious Jewish feminists, on the  other hand, are busy making up for a millennium of lost time. They are rewriting,  expanding and expounding upon the huge  canon of texts that make up the religious  Jewish heritage; reconceptualizing God and  prayer; and recovering past Jewish women's spiritual experiences. Secular and religious interests are by no means exclusive  and I imagine most Jewish feminists, if  asked, would express interest in all of these  things.  The differences in orientation toward  Jewish identity are real, however, and when  writing for a diverse audience, assumptions  cannot be made about Jewish readers' religious practice and knowledge, belief in  God, or interest in prayer and scripture.  This is not an easy task.  While we obviously seek work partially based on the contexts from which a  woman is writing, we do not propose any  single definition of feminism or Judaism.  Our goal for Bridges is to create the forum  in which diverse women speak for themselves and engage in dialogue with each  other One of our central questions remains:  how can non-Jewish women be allies to  Jewish women? What are the insights non-  Jewish women take from our experiences?  What will be the sound of non-Jewish  voices which take our lives as seriously as  we do? For the future we plan to pursue  soliciting more non-Jews to review books  by and about Jewish women.  As I write these last lines about creating more connections of understanding and  support between Jewish and non-Jewish  women, I am reminded of the complex reasons I joined New Jewish Agenda in 1982,  and eight years later helped found an independent Jewish feminist journal: my political urgency; my joy and passion in being a lesbian; my joy and passion in being  Jewish; Reagan's attack on unions and low  income workers; war between Palestine  and Arab countries; the gathering winds of  the specifically homophobic religious right.  These complex factors and many others led  me to be deeply critical of U.S. society and  to personal isolation. Helping to build Jewish feminist organizations that value diver  sity has definitely ended my isolation, but  progress on the political goals has been elusive. While I think Bridges is contributing,  however slightly, to reshaping the definition of Jewishness, we've barely begun on  the objective of building alliances with non-  Jews that could affect political values and  the priorities of society in general.  We will continue to work from our assumption that learning more about Jewish  experiences in the world will lead us to  connect with others. We know that Jews  are not all middle-class, or all white. We  know that Jews are from Asian, Middle  Eastern, African and European cultures,and  that they have mixed heritages of all sorts.  Knowing who we are as Jews in our complexity and difference is necessary for us  as well as for our allies. The questions remain as urgent as ever: who are Jewish  feminists and what are we doing in our  own communities? Who are our political  allies? How do we discover them? How  do we become allies to others? How can  others become political allies to us?  Clare Kinberg lives in Eugene, OR and is  Managing Editor of Bridges.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Celebrating the mask of the physical:  The epiphany of Purim  by Andrea Cohen-Kiener   Purim is the deepest holiday. Every  year a new understanding emerges of what  it means to hide behind a mask or to enter  a frame of mind in which one cannot distinguish the hero from the villain. What  does it mean to be joyous at the edge of  destruction? Why do we practice seeing  God's hand in a story that does not mention God? There is a pun about the depth  of Purim: "Yom Kippur is a day like  Purim/Yom Kippurim yom k'purim."  What an amazing comparison to make!  Every other day of the Jewish calendar  we practice an exquisite balance between the body and the spirit. We eat  food (a bodily need) and we bless before and after (a spiritual need). We enjoy sexual contacts, but not just with  anyone, not any old time. There are  limits. We humans are allowed to cater to all of our appetites—all within  limits. Yom Kippur and Purim are different. On Yom Kippur, we make believe that we do not have a body. We  enter our own afterlife, do our life review, dress in the white robes in  which we will be buried. We wear the  wings of our tallit all day long. We  don't eat; we sing and pray as the celestial host does. On Yom Kippur, we  serve God from a place of pure spirit.  On Purim, just the opposite; we enter that holy time by drinking and  eating and telling a ribald story. On  Purim, the name of the Holy One is  not invoked. It is a day of hiding  and games, a day of extra layers, not  a day of increased exposure. These  two days are alike because they are completely dissimilar. They are both days of imbalance; they balance each other within the  year. Every year I am blessed with a Purim  moment. It's always a little different—always a little work to get there. One year,  my Purim moment came compliments of a  local gemara teacher who came to our party  as a giant blue Smurf. "Hag Sameach," he  wished me. At that particular moment, I  had just enough vodka in my system to provoke the Purim moment. "Good Yontiff"  from a big blue gemara blasting Smurf.  Ahhh! The year before, it was different. Our  shul had just initiated the custom of banning hard liquor at the Purim party. Talk  about  saving those attendees who did not have  the foresight or moxy to bring their own. I  had quite a few l'chayims that night and  only a vague memory of getting home. That  Purim was the deepest of the deep! I danced  religious oppression! I delight in breaking unjust laws. My  Purim disguise that year was that of a barmaid. I brought my own l'chayim, cleverly  disguised as wine. It took quite some mixing of the blue and red food coloring to  tinge the vodka just right, a worthy effort,  though! I was not alone in my ruse. Taking  Purim this seriously, I had the company of  several in the Chabad camp who had good  use for the giant pockets on those kapatas.  My Chabad buddies and I went around  in circles all night long: alone,  with my soul-sisters, with the little girls  from the Chabad families. I danced in circles for hours and hours on a stomach full  of vodka and I did not throw up. Enough  to make one believe in God, don't you  think? The next morning I woke up with  an exquisite sense of cleanliness. It felt as if  all the circles had aligned me with the cosmic dance. As I spun, I had opened myself  to the flow. I had washed my channels. The  oLu*xci/pxxxi&>  room was still spinning when I awoke and  for several hours that morning. I was useless at work, a blob of marvel and joy. I  couldn't move into mundane time. An extended Purim moment. Last Purim I  reached a new level of understanding of the  phrase "until you don't know."  I Purim is a time of paradoxes. We  are commanded to blur the distinction between the blessing and the  curse, between the good guy and  the bad. All proceeds from God.  What shall we curse? Who shall we  bless? On Purim we live at the edge.  We practice expecting the transformation that will flip our difficulties  into miracles. Ten days before Purim  in 57571 had a total mastectomy for  the treatment of breast cancer. This  was my first mortality brush and I  was still in the grips of fear. I was  desperately seeking advice of all  kinds—diets, herbs, exercise, chemotherapy. I was afraid for my life.  Every phone call and every book  held hope. Maybe this would be the  information that would save my very  life. The morning before Purim, I  spoke with a woman who had cured  herself of advanced bone cancer.  "Macrobiotics saved my life," she announced bluntly. Later that day, a dear  friend, also a breast cancer survivor,  called me and said "Meat, meat, meat,  at every meal." The advice could not  have been more dissimilar. I went into  the spiritual equivalent of the fetal position: I sat on my meditation pillow  and tried to pull back from the edge  of anxiety. After a few unsuccessful  moments, I was sobbing in sorrow and  desperation. What should I do? How  would I know? What if I do exactly the  wrong thing or do the right things in the  wrong order? My life is at stake! I want to  live! My husband came in mid-sob (how  do they know these things?). He held me  for a while as I choked out my questions.  "You don't get to know," he said simply.  "You have to do everything that you can,  try your very best to figure this out, but you  do not get to know." "Ad d'lo yada," until  you get to the point of not knowing. 5757  was the hardest Purim I've had so far. My  mind was aching for assurances and answers. Tearing away from my desire to  know was like ripping off my skin. I felt  raw and alive. I heard the whole megillah  that night. I drank, I danced, I came in a  costume. I came as a patient and my whole  family came in surgical scrubs. I came in a  costume that was new for me, the Needy  One, the one that had previously been hiding. I celebrated with wilful determination.  The insight of that Purim was that sometimes we just don't get to know. Sometimes  we simply choose to dance at the edge.

NISSAN, ADAR 5760/APRIL 2000 Feature  Redefining women's sexuality:  In the image of Eve  by Lysa Smythe  I have always sensed an ambiguous  attitude regarding women's sexuality in  orthodox rabbinic Judaism.The ambiguous  attitude is of woman as "good" mother and  woman as "bad" seductress. In some way  it seems that women are feared as erotically  seductive and thereby dangerous to the  well-being and piety of [m]an. My objective here is to explore the construction of  the negative perception of female sexuality within the Jewish creation myth of Genesis. I chose this myth because I believe that  it both reflects and has perpetuated a patriarchal perception of female sexuality  within rabbinic culture through history.  Within the story of Genesis, Eve was  created as the first woman. As the first  woman, she was also the archetype of the  universal Mother. The bestowing on her of  this role is revealed in her Hebrew name  "Chavah" or "Life" signifying her place as  the mother of "all living things". As the  model of mother and the first earthly female, she was commanded to "be fruitful  and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). By the decree  of this commandment to reproduce, Eve's  sexual activity is positive, virtuous and  even sacred. Eve is "good".  Her "goodness" is not in dispute until  she eats of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. Still, even after her "sin", she maintains her status as the universal mother.  What we do see when Eve sins is the change  in her role from mother to child. Within this  story, Eve's sin was that she did not obey  God's commandment. This myth is very  much a story about humanity's childlike relationship with the parental Source of creation. I mention this to show that Eve's sin  was innocent and at this time had no connection with her sexuality. The myth of Eve  as the embodiment of carnal and sexual sin  was developed approximately 1100 years  later based on new interpretations concerning her punishments in Eden.  It was not until the time of the post-  biblical interpretations of the second century rabbis, that Eve was transformed from  the archetypal mother and wife to the symbolic source of evil and sin, responsible for  the downfall of man. The rabbis justified  their reconstruction of Eve based on particular passages in Genesis that they took  out of context to substantiate their views.  First, the rabbis argued that Eve's greatest  sin was using her new knowledge of sexual  prowess to_seduce and entice Adam into  sin as well JAs a result of her actions, Eve's  first punishment was that "her desire,  (sexual), would be for her husband and he  shall rule over her" (Genesis 3:16). Furthermore, the rabbis argued that Eve's second  punishment - "in pain, she shall bring forth  children" (Genesis 3:16), was issued because Eve used her sexual wiles for evil and  not for the good of procreation.  Interestingly, when the rabbis interpreted the creation myth, all of their focus  was on Eve as the perpetrator of Adam's  downfall and exile from Eden. Yet Adam  was also given the Divine gift of free will.  If he had the freedom to choose, why did  the rabbis put so much emphasis on recon  structing Eve as the evil seductress? Tribble  argues that within the creation myth, Eve  is represented as more intelligent, more sensible and wiser than Adam. She is the one  who was able to converse with the snake,  understand and deliberate the consequences of her actions and then make a decision on her own to eat from the tree. In  this way, she threatened patriarchal power  by challenging the premise of male intellectual superiority.  The early inter-  pressed Eve. They justified their suppression by defining Eve as the inferior sex, the  sex in close communication with, and easily influenced by, demonic forces.  Once Eve was redefined as the embodiment of carnal sin, the whole creation myth  also underwent a metamorphosis. The  story changed, from a myth regarding loss  of innocence and the knowledge of good  and evil, into a fable about the evilness of  carnal pursuits. It appears that the rabbis  focused on three points to justify this development. First, the fact that the primary  conscious realization of Adam after he ate  of the fruit was that he was naked (Genesis  3:10); second, that he was ashamed in his  nakedness which implies that nakedness  was no longer innocent but sexual (Genesis 3:10); third, that intercourse in the garden was never referred to until after he ate  the fruit, was exiled and then "knew" his  wife (Genesis 4:1). The rabbis used their  new fable as a moral guidebook to teach  and perpetuate their own patriarchal values and attitudes concerning the power of  women and female seduction. Over time,  the fable became established and accepted  as an authoritative truth passed on to successive generations.  In this way Eve has had vast existential implications on contemporary perceptions of woman within Orthodox Judaism.  Throughout history, she has been a model  by which religion and society at large have  constructed a perception of women and female sexuality. I believe that the model of  Eve reflects the ambiguity of the desire of  men's own sexual gratification coupled  with the fear of women's autonomous  thought and their potential rise in status  and power. In order to repress female  power, the rabbis used this myth to implicate women as sexually licentious and evil.  Within rabbinic culture, these views have  been used to subjugate women and exclude  them from many areas of ritual and ceremo  nial practice. Perhaps it is time to reconstruct Eve again as a mother and a powerfully autonomous woman.  It is time to change HIStory to  HERstory.

It  was delivered at Hebrew University College.  Religious terms in Hebrew are defined in the  sidebar.  Hazak, Hazak, V'nithazek (be strong,  be strong, and let us  strengthen each  other). This phrase  is chanted first by  the congregation,  and then by the Torah reader each  time a book of Torah is finished being  read aloud in the  synagogue. In current discussions, the  term 'feminism' has  many definitions  and connotations.  My own view is that  it is an ideology  based on the belief  that both men and  women are entitled  to full social, political, religious, and  economic equality,  and that there is a mandate to work actively  to achieve that equality. As a person of faith,  I believe this is part of the work of creating  a society that lives up to God's expectations.  In the contemporary Reform community,  we have escaped from the bondage of  Mitzrayim (Egypt). We no longer begin our  prayer services with men reciting the blessing "shelo asani ishah" (thank you, blessed  God, for not making me a woman). We no  longer believe that "kol b'isha erva," (hearing a woman's voice), constitutes revealing nakedness. We no longer have  mekhitzot in our sanctuaries which separate women from the Torah. We no longer  believe that a man who teaches his daughter Torah teaches her licentiousness. We no  longer believe that women are too  feebleminded to be witnesses.  We no longer believe that a woman is  not person enough to be obligated to pray  and thus be counted in a minyan. We also  no longer believe that a woman who speaks  words of Torah in front of the community  violates "k'vod ha-tsibbur," (the honor of  the public), because it implies that there are  no men capable of offering wisdom. We no  longer hold these beliefs, and a hundred  others that would confine us, both men and  women, to narrow gender roles and expectations. We have made a commitment to  dismantle the gender inequalities embedded in our tradition, both in ideology and  in practice. We challenge traditional stereotypes which portray men as the pursuers,  while women are the pursued; men as ra-  We are in the  midst of an  unfinished  revolution,  working to  fulfill God's  expectations.  tional, while women are emotional; men as  the actors, while women are the enablers.  We have broken free of these bonds, which  constrain personal growth, achievement,  self-image, and self-esteem.  Although I am one of those fortunate  women who has reaped the benefits of the  second wave of feminism, I have experienced both the constraints of discrimination and the exhilaration of liberation  from Mitzrayim. In  my journey towards ordination, I  lived as a closeted  lesbian at the Jew-  Si Theological  Seminary. When I  transferred to Hebrew Union College, I experienced  a great transformation. At JTS, I had  no dreams, no visions of the future.  I could only think  of "making it  through" rabbinical school with my  mental health intact. The world  was an unfriendly  place, and it was exceedingly difficult to  maintain a modicum of self-respect in a  community where I could not be accepted  or seen for who I was. I lost a sense of my  own creativity and my own imagination. I  was narrowly defined, forced to conform  to what I was not. When I was able to come  out publicly at HUC, I felt an exhilarating  sense of freedom. I still  bear the scars of the JTS  experience, but have regained my ability to  dream, to imagine the  future, and to explore  fully the kind of rabbi  that I want to become.  We, at HUC, have  reached Har Sinai, the  mountain of Sinai. We  have heard the revelation: [w]omen are equal  to men and as such  should lead meaningful  personal and intellectual  lives in which they are  each free to be creative in  any way they choose. We  are willing to try to construct a world in which  the biology of human beings is separated from  their social destinies. If  most of us had not heard  this call, we would not  be sitting here. HUC has  reached a time when  about half of its students are women. Just  as importantly, we have recently created a  chair for feminist studies on the faculty. We  have begun to include women in every aspect of leadership in the Jewish community. We have begun to listen to the silences  of women's experience in our recorded history. We have begun to change our liturgy,  and have created myriad rituals which reflect the stages in women's life cycles as  well as men's. We have published works  of feminist theology and anthologies of  women's spirituality. One of our recent  graduates has even founded a feminist  yeshiva in Jerusalem.  Just as revelation of Torah inspires ongoing interpretation of its teachings, so  feminism has its own Torah sheb'al peh,  Oral Torah. We have mahlokot: debates  about how best to actualize our newly-  found understanding. The mahlokot of  feminism are many: debates over sexuality, over pornography and censorship; over  conflicts between the duties of citizenship  and the duties of motherhood; over the  compatibility of feminism and nationalism.  But perhaps the most central debate concerns women's identity formation. Do we  view gender differences as an entirely social construct, nurtured by the ways in  which we interact with one another, or are  gender differences part of our essential  nature as human beings? Related to this  question is the issue of all-women's spaces,  such as Rosh Hodesh groups.

As we go through the process of  change and interpretation, it is clear that  everyone's needs in this feminist quest are  not the same. There is certainly diversity  within the feminist community. These debates remain mahlokot 1'shem, Arguments  for the Sake of Heaven.  So, given all that we have accomplished, have we reached Israel? Are we  truly in the post-feminist age? Or have we  stagnated, still lost in the desert? On our  feminist journey, I believe we are atYericho  (Jericho). We've moved through dor  hamidbar, the generation of the desert.  We're on the hills, overlooking the land of  Israel. We're on the edge of something new.  We're ready to hear the Mishneh Torah, the  repetition of the terms of our covenant with  God with new additions and with a new  perspective. But our work is not yet complete. We are in the midst of an unfinished  revolution, working to fulfill God's expectations. And so, just as we attempt to integrate Torah and Judaism into every aspect  of our lives, so should we integrate feminism. "Lo alaikhem, v'alaikhen ham'lakha  ligmor, v'lo lihibatel mimena" (it is not your  obligation to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it).We have  chosen to become Jewish professionals because we are serious people, and because  we want to confront issues of central importance in our lives. Feminism is one of  them. Let us use the power of our thoughts  and our actions to be at the forefront of  change.  So what is the ultimate goal? What  does Yisrael look like? I am not exactly sure,  but I imagine that it is an era in which con  sciousness will become so truly androgynous that the adjective 'feminist' itself will  be obsolete. Just as the Torah imagines that  the Israelites might be able to enter the land,  and engage in a peaceful domestic existence, feminist victory is quiet. It consists of  allowing all people, women and men to live  their lives in freedom, with normalcy and  confidence to be fully themselves. Every  year, we read through the books of the Torah again. We go through the process of liberation and change over and over. Each  time, let us take more people with us. There  are people at all of these milestones along  the jouraey. There are those still living in  Mitzrayim, and those in the midst of their  travels. Those on the peak of the mountain,  and those pushing over the final hills which  obscure the horizon. Each person's step,  every woman's, and every man's, is of  value. Each small step carries us closer to  Israel. Let's move toward the day when we  can be gathered together, each one of us  equally honored, and holy.

Humanity is the sole agent capable  of receiving divine inspiration and applying it to the task of mending this broken  world. The Kabbalah provides certain  guidelines for harmonious physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual development,  so that human beings can evolve into integrated and balanced individuals. Most importantly, in our search for clues to the mystery of Jewish creativity, Kabbalistic principles seem to offer a pathway towards  greater receptivity to intuitive ideas and  creative inspiration.  The historical beginnings of the  Kabbalah are obscured in a maze of conflicting evidence. Some believe that the  Kabbalah, or at least its major written texts,  appeared during the 13th century, while  others believe that as a secret mystical doctrine the Kabbalah has been in existence  from very ancient times.  For centuries, the Jewish mystical tradition held a central and venerated position in the minds of the Jewish people. In  certain periods of Jewish history, the Kabbalists were revered and ranked among the  top religious and cultural elite in Jewish  communities around the world. It was only  with the advent of the Age of Enlightenment and the tragic fate of self-proclaimed  Kabbalistic Messiahs, such as Shabtai Zvi,  that the study of the Kabbalah receded into  the background of Jewish religious life. In  the late 19th century, the Kabbalistic spirit  was reborn in a popularized form within a  new movement which has come to be  known as the Hasidic movement.  During the past few centuries a certain  number of ill-suited individuals were attracted to the Kabbalah and the subsequent  abuse of the tradition in the hands of these  self-serving individuals gave rise to a distorted image of the Kabbalah as a dangerous and superstitious belief system. There  is no doubt that the Kabbalah is a powerful, inspirational, and practical tool; however, in the hands of those who have not  transcended their own egotistical limitations it can be quite harmful.  There is an impressive body of evidence indicating that some of the world's  greatest minds and creative geniuses were  interested in the principles of the Kabbalah.  In Literature and the Occult Tradition, Professor D. Saurat concludes that virtually all  great poetry in English owes its quality to  the injection of a certain mystical influence,  and traces this influence to the Kabbalah  or Jewish mysticism.  The study of Kabbalah has recently attracted not only the attention of high profile public figures such as Hillary Clinton,  comedienne Roseanne Barr, and Madonna,  but is fast becoming a major field of investigation in mainstream academia as well.  The downside of this torrent of popular and  academic Kabbalistic teachings is that,  without the proper discipline and preparation, even the most sincere seeker can  easily drown and be sidetracked for many  years. In such times, one is well advised to  exercise serious caution and to remember  that "[wjhen a student is ready, a teacher  appears".
