Thanks to Mowani Carter and  Christine de La Rosa-Drinkwater for their  permission to run "Living Deliberately."  I went to Seattle to see with my own  eyes what happened in the streets, so  Nandita Sharma's piece on the WTO helps  dispel the notion of riots and mayhem deliberately broadcast by the mainstream  media. I am indebted to Sarah Hunt for  getting in a piece on the Bad Date Sheet, a  weekly that I've wanted to feature for years  as a record of women's resistance to victimization in Vancouver's Downtown East  Side.  I had hoped to connect with women's  groups in Cuba for a piece on the Mothers'  March. The Elian custody struggle between  the United States and Cuba should be  monitored in regards to International Law,  custody and the idea of ' State as Father'  which is a pervasive theme. I wonder, if it  had been a daughter would the response  on either side have been the same? Would  a Haitian child rescued receive the same  push for US citizenship as is being presented to the US Supreme court in the case  of Elian?  The revelation of the identity of a Pakistani girl-child found in pieces around the  lake in Ontario, and the completion of the  Mindy Tran trial with a 'not guilty' verdict  is depressing. The pattern of violence  against women and elders—with the murder of seniors in the last few months (specifically in Vancouver)— raises the question: are we making any changes here in  Canada? Before we throw our hands in the  Ruth Ellis, a 100 year old African American lesbian, has gained a huge  following since her story was filmed by Yvonne Welborn. The documentary  has been shown across North America to appreciative audiences. Ruth is  seen here with one of Kinesis' cover models Rubina (age 9) at the Women of  Colour BBQ during the 1999 Michigan Women's Festival  The December/January Native Women's special was a brilliant issue to try to  follow. It was important to me that this issue not stand in isolation, i.e. Black women  separate from other minorities... I am very  grateful to Professor Aylward who granted  me an interview on very short notice about  the Law Program at Dalhousie for  Mi'kmaqs and African-Canadians. A necessary law program that doesn't make  apologies for addressing the historic absence of justice within the law courts for  minorities.  The Barrel Children issue got me thinking about the majority of current Canadian  domestic workers who are predominantly  Filipina women like many Jamaican  women professionally trained as nurses  and yet restricted to bedside duty in homes  and hospitals. Would the experiences documented in the research relate to them? I  wonder.  The Quebec interview gives insight on  education issues for immigrants to Quebec  with the complications due to English and  French tension. Next door is Ontario and  what an absolute joy it is to feature Nalo  Hopkinson, who's latest book is slated for  release in March. There are not many science fiction writers of colour, much less in  Canada! Nalo has gained the attention of  American science fiction critics, her 'forward fiction' deserves the support right  here in Canada.  The documentary "Its a Hair Thing"  promises to be a refreshing new look at the  importance of the Hair salon within Black  culture as a meeting place with a sense of  community beyond hair-oil and hot combs!  Donnette Zacca's photography captured  my attention on a trip to Jamaica in December of 1996. Her work continues to intrigue  me, I am very pleased to present it both on  the cover as well as throughout the paper.  air and give up, I'd like to draw your attention to RAWA.This is a group of exiled  Afghan women risking their lives daily for  one another against the fundamentalist  groups using religion and torture to subjugate women. If RAWA can persist with all  the programs they run with little or no  money, we here in Canada certainly can  'hold the line.' By holding the line, we preserve steps made in the last 30 years so that  the next generation can carry forward.  Thanks to Georgina Farah for pulling together that page and being my right hand  woman throughout the last two weeks.  I'd like to close by saying thanks to the  Kinesis staff, Amal Rana and Jenn Lo and  volunteers Helen Babalos and Fatima. Eye  Design made the cover and handled the  many requests for changes professionally  and with openness. Thanks to Dana  Gluckstein who agreed to allow us to reprint her photo of the Haitian women without cost or question.  I would like to thank Kathy March who  helped me with interviewing and transcribing. Janisse Browning made a special visit  to Kinesis on a rare trip from Galiano Island.

FEBRUARY 2000 News  A question of funding  Reform party attacks  lesbians again  by Isabel Fitzgerald  When you hear of an attack on funding for lesbian groups, what's the first political party that springs to mind? Bingo!  The Reform Party is at it again.  B.C. Reform MP John Reynolds lashed  Hedy Fry, Secretary of State for the Status  of Women, in January for providing  $254,000 in funding to Canadian lesbian  groups, claiming that the $145,000 Fry approved for B.C. lesbian groups was a handout to bolster Fry's re-election hopes.  Fry dismissed Reynolds' criticism saying she remains committed to funding lesbian groups and noted that the media play  the story received was highly questionable.  Fry pointed out that neither of the two  Southam papers carrying the story, the  National Post and the tabloid Vancouver  Province, contacted her for comment on  Reynolds' charges. Both the Post and the  Province are owned by media mogul,  Conrad Black, a noted homophobe and  failed knighthood supplicant.  Grants to B.C. groups included funding for a safety audit, an education program  for teachers about the problems gay and  lesbian youth face, and a project aimed at  lobbying for immigration reform for same  sex couples.  Vinder Lalli, a representative of the  Quesnel Women's Centre, which was  awarded a grant to educate teachers, said  "This money will actually save lives by  helping prevent teen suicide." She noted  that suicide rates among gay and lesbian  teens are very high, particularly in a resource-industry town like Quesnel where  gay and lesbian teens are afraid to even  disclose their sexual orientation.  According to Audrey Johnson of the  Vancouver Status of Women, criticism of  funding for lesbian groups is nothing new.  "It was only ten years ago," Johnson  said, "that the federal government refused  to fund lesbian groups because it was afraid  funding for lesbian issues was too controversial.  While VSW is pleased that Hedy Fry  is standing firm on this issue, it's important to remember that it was Canadian  courts that made governments think twice  about discrimination against gays and lesbians. Political support came later. We must  always be alert to protect lesbian and gay  access to government funding."  Reynolds said his opposition to federal  funding for lesbian groups was not about  lesbian groups per se, but was about funding to all groups, including Boy Scouts. Interestingly newspapers' headlines did not  read "Reform opposed to funding for Boy  Scouts."  Reynolds and the Vancouver Province  coverage also seemingly argued that funding to lesbian groups was linked to federal  funding cutbacks in a number of areas including health care, Canadian Army peacekeeping missions and RCMP fraud investigations.  Complaining that the federal government is out of touch, Reynolds suggested  that the Canadian Security Intelligence  Service (CSIS) stopped surveillance on a  suspected Algerian terrorist because they  ran out of money. "He could have blown  up the whole city," Reynolds is quoted as  saying. "But Hedy Fry is out funding minority causes in her riding."  Following Reynolds' catastrophic  thinking to its logical conclusion, he seems  to be arguing that a couple of hundred  thousand dollars for lesbians and gays  means nothing and no one is safe. As always, when it comes to being out of touch,  it's hard to top the Reform Party. Could it  be time to call out the Boy Scouts?

World March of Women  2000  by Daisy Kler  The World March of Women 2000, initiated by the Federation des Femmes du  Quebec, is a series of collective actions to  protest against poverty and violence toward women. These collective actions will  . take place throughout the year 2000.  The idea of the March grew out of the  experience of The Women's March Against  Poverty, which took place in Quebec in  1995. This event was incredibly successful  with women marching for ten days and  winning nine demands related to economic  justice from the Quebec government.  The participation during the March in  1995 of twenty women from countries of  the South highlighted the need for global  solidarity-building. The Beijing Conference  of Women re-confirmed that women everywhere are struggling for equality, equal  economic development and to eradicating  violence. The idea of the international  march was first proposed at the Beijing conference.  The kick off event  for the World March  of Women 2000 begins on International Women's Day  on    March    8th.  Women, both nationally and internationally are organizing  to launch their planned  activities on this da  Over 130 countries around  the world are participating in  this global collective action.  There are national and international coordinating bodies set   **  up, but events for the March are  planned on all levels; locally nationally and  regionally. One highlight is a "World Rally"  at the United Nations in New York.  A coalition of women is organizing  events in Vancouver. One event planned for  this exciting herstorical day is a "federal  building circle" in which 2000 women will  join hands and circle the  federal      buildings  around        Library  Square at noon. Each  woman will be wearing a placard with one  of "2000 good reasons  f   to march." These reasons  will match the national demands that we will be issuing on how to end poverty  and violence against women.  Other activities  include a "Tent  City"    where  there will be information tables and displays relating to  violence against women and  poverty. The tent city will serve as an all  day organizing, gathering, publicity and alliance building centre. There will also be a  march and rally.  What we require from the people of  Vancouver and surrounding areas are  "Community Leaders." We need people  who can organize ten to fifteen members  of their community who will commit to  attending the March 8th events. We need  women who are willing to surround the  federal building, and women and men who  will participate in the March and Rally. We  are calling on everyone to seize the opportunity of this herstorical action to demand"  economic and social justice for women  worldwide.  If you think you are able to step up and be  a leader in your community please call (604)  253-0067. Start organizing to participate in a  global action to end poverty and violence  against women everywhere.  (You define your community, meaning  not only geographical location. We are interested in community leaders from diverse backgrounds.)  <For more information contact the  World March of Women 2000 at their  website: http://www.ffq.qc.ca  FEBRUARY 2000  KINESIS News  The message of Seattle:  wBttDn fc WT©§  by Nandita Sharma  By now, it has become a truism that the  WTO meetings in Seattle and people's response to them mark a watershed in political activism in NorthAmerica. Finally here,  in the " belly of the beast", we have joined  our actions with people in the South and  Indigenous peoples everywhere who have  been resisting the exploitation of white,  capitalist patriarchy. For the last thirty  years, people in the First World market  were consuming at a feverish pace. Capitalists were busy figuring out how to make  even more profits.  'Progress' in technologies of all kind  (computer, transport, etc.) soon made it efficient to relocate factories to where labour  had been cheapened through colonialism  and ongoing imperialism of the Third  World. Free-export zones were set up  WTO —we are drowning in an alphabetic  sludge of government pimps, corporate  pirates and trade pushers.  The action called 'Shut Down the  WTO' has thrown a well-aimed monkey  wrench into the plans of the rulers. We  gained much more than all those who came  to Seattle to 'negotiate' with white men run-  throughout the Global South and women  of colour became the workers of choice for  investors intent on making the highest  profit possible. The rural economies of the  South were decimated to ensure a supply  of newly made workers in the factories.  Agribusinesses replaced subsistence farmers, toxins were introduced into organic  goods and billions of dollars in profits were  stored in the banks of the First World.  Capitalists moving to places where  people of colour had been turned into  'cheap labour' caused the sun to set on the  "golden days" for white middle-class Canadians and their unionized working class  counterparts. A new era of globalization  ensued. Not surprisingly, this 'new global  order' does not seem particularly new to  Indigenous peoples and other people of  colour in either the First or Third Worlds.  Within Canada, the Indigenous population continues to be dispossessed by the  state, and people of colour continue to be  cast as villains in an immoral play where  we are actually blamed by white workers  for having been made 'cheaper' than them.  Life continues in a chain of exploitation  from Christopher Columbus to Bill Gates;  new arrangements have been made to secure that the beasts continue to rule. IMF,  World Bank, FTA, NAFTA, APEC, MAI and  ning the WTO. Following the Direct Action  campaign to Shut Down the WTO, people  have seen the face of the WTO is the face of  the riot cop ready to maim and kill on command.  Now there has been a lot of talk about  the 'violence' that occurred on the streets  of Seattle by some of the protesters. We cannot allow ourselves to call the breaking of  windows of key corporate sponsors of the  WTO meeting, like Starbucks or Nike, a violent activity. To do so serves to weaken our  movement. Remember that the real violence lies in enclosing and privatizing common space, forcing people to rely on coffee  exports, and profiting from exploiting the  fruits of someone else's labour. The only  acts of [personal] violence in Seattle came  from the state and WTO-sanctioned assaults of the Seattle police force, the USA  National Guard and various USA Sheriff  personnel.  My involvement in the protests in  Seattle has been a turning point. It was in  Seattle where I saw our power as a grassroots movement against capitalist globalization being strengthened, consolidated  and radicalized. This is partly because our  direct actions showed the moral and strategic bankruptcy of the small minority who  would have  us co-operate  with      the  WTO      instead      of  shutting it down.  Indeed after  the power that the  grassroots people  demonstrated in  Seattle, it is more  distressing than ever to see a small number  of NGO 'leaders' sealing the WTO as 'fix-  able', 'reformable' or 'open to democratization' when it is clear to most that the only  good WTO is no WTO.  I want to use this opportunity to say  that we must stop giving a platform to,  marching behind, or propping up those  who are willing to sell us out for reserved  labour, NGO seats at  the   WTO,   or   for  'green' (environmental), 'blue' (labour) or  social clauses in the  WTO  agreements.  Every aspect of the  WTO is detrimental.  Green, Blue or Social  Clauses cannot 'fix'  this as there is no  such thing as 'fair  trade' in a white  capitalist patriarchy.  There is not a  single one of us, not  a single organization, that has the  right to negotiate away people's greatest  power against the WTO and our ability  to Shut it Down! Those taking a collaborative position need to be condemned as  their compromise entrenches the borders  between the 'First' and 'Third' Worlds,  men and women, working peoples and  their bosses and between whites, Indigenous peoples and other  people of colour.  Let us work to  strengthen those groups  and individuals that are  taking a principled  stance in complete and  uncompromising opposition to the WTO and  disengage with those  who are satisfied with a  'reformed WTO'. The often used slogan, 'no  more negotiations'  should come to mean no  more negotiations between NGOs and the WTO! Let us not be  silenced by those who think it possible to  live with the beasts.

SIS  FEBRUARY 2000 What's News  =    =Jy  f^  We interrupt this program for a very  important announcement! The Kinesis  team has officially survived Y2K without  even one computer hiccup or meltdown.  Of course, we weren't really worried because we refused to listen to all the  hype...wait! What's thatY2K scan doing on  the production room computer? Oops.  Guess we were just a teensy weensy bit  anxious but that's all over now. It's January and after debating over whether this  really is the new millennium or not, we  decided that it didn't matter because it was  a good excuse to celebrate new beginnings  and exciting changes. And that's exactly  what we're doing!  January 2000 has been an exciting time  for Kinesis. In the past year, the paper has  gone through some extremely hard times,  leaving both the staff and volunteers burnt  out; however, sunnier days have dawned  and brought with them some inspiring new  faces and some badly needed revitalization.  The first face to brighten up our mango  coloured walls is Nadine Chambers.  Nadine offered up her considerable talents  and energy as guest editor for this month's  issue. Being that February is Black History  Month, her offer could not have come at a  better time. She worked endlessly to gather  resources, interviews, articles and artwork  from Black women all over the country. Her  efforts paid off and resulted in an amazing  and insightful tribute to the diversity,  strength and creativity of Black women  from a variety of backgrounds. Nadine has  been a board member of various organizations around town and has also organized  events for Black History Month for  Kwantlen college. She has also been a performer at the Women in View Festival and  a co-host at Co-op Radio in Vancouver.  Along the way, she has somehow managed  to find time to contribute to Kinesis as both  a writer and volunteer. We'd like to welcome Nadine as January's guest editor and  congratulate her on doing such a fabulous  job with this issue.  Along with having a guest editor for  this month's issue, there has also been a  great deal of restructuring at Kinesis. Given  that our last search for a new editor did not  yield any results, we decided to report the  position. We are in the process of interviewing potential candidates and are hoping to  have it filled by the time the February is  sue lands in your hands. In the meantime,  we've decided to fill in the gaps by inviting different women to guest edit the paper. To make things easier for them and for  the other Kinesis staff and volunteers,  we've also created a temporary editorial  assistant position. We're elated, ecstatic and  very excited to welcome Georgina Farah as  our new editorial assistant.  Georgina has worked with various activist groups such as the Basmati Action  Group and DARE. Aside from being an  anti-racist biotechnology activist (whew,  say that fast five times), she is involved with  ongoing research into the plight of Afghan  women and enjoys secretly photocopying  activist information on corporate accounts  in stuffy offices. Sick to death of Canadian  racism, Georgina still manages to be ever  cheerful and extremely organized. She has  managed to turn the production process  into a well-oiled, smoothly running machine and we can't thank her enough even  though we are extremely jealous of her  amazing clothes collection. Welcome  Georgina! Don't worry, we'll write more  embarrassing things about you next time!  New positions and fresh faces have inspired us to work on a number of other new  ideas for Kinesis such as: offering anti-oppression workshops and skills training to  our volunteers, restructuring the editorial  board and recruiting new members, and  planning specific themes for our next few  issues. We want the internal changes within  our structure to reflect in the paper as well  so please send us your ideas, comments and  suggestions.  While we're on the topic of changes,  we'd also like to take a moment to thank  Helen Babalos. Helen has been a longstanding member of the Coordinating Collective at the Vancouver Status of Women  (VSW). She has been instrumental in acting as a liaison between Kinesis and the Coordinating Collective and - in lieu of a functioning editorial board - has provided us  with much needed direction and support.  Keep up the good work Helen!  We'd also like to welcome Monica Lee  who worked as a volunteer on this month's  issue. Since we've hyped you up with all  this talk of changes and new faces, we  thought it would be a good time to remind  you that we'll be in production for our February issue from February 14-21. Our next  story meetings will be on February 2 and 8  at our offices. So if you want to be part of  the excitement, feel free to drop by! That's  pretty much what's been happening inside  our walls this month. See you in March for  our IWD and community economic development issue.  » J*    J     Book &  ¥     Wr Art Emporium  Western Canada's  Lesbian & Gay  Bookstore  Open Daily 10am to 11pm  Our Books/Our Issues  Gay Fiction  Lesbian Fiction  Our Magazines & Journals  AIDS/Health  Humour  Erotica  Queer Theory  Feminist Theory  Biographies, Essays, Poetry  Religion & Spirituality  Art & Photography  Community  Little Sister's Book & Art Emporium  1238 Davie Street, Vancouver, B.C.

The  strikers were employed as packers in the  plant, working long shifts for as little as $3  a day. They began organizing last May and  set up their picket lines in September. The  women and children striking against  Congeladora del Rio were then fired by the  company who sent in armed guards to intimidate the strikers. The company then  brought in replacement workers from a  nearby town - mostly teenage girls. Although the state of Guanajuato has tried to  intervene and reach an agreement between  the company and the union, Global Trading (US parent of Congeladora) has refused  to sign any agreements so far.

First Woman  Publicly Executed in  Afghanistan  A mother of seven, who was found  guilty of beating her husband to death with  a steel hammer while he slept, was publicly executed in Afghanistan this past November. She is the first woman to be publicly executed under the Taliban Regime,  and her execution was held in Kabul's sport  stadium. The Taliban claim to interpret the  Qur'an as commanding that murderers are  to be publicly executed by relatives of their  victims, adulterers stoned to death, limbs  of thieves amputated, and those who commit less serious crimes to undergo public  beatings.

Women as  Peace-Builders  Women's peace and reconciliation  groups in Burundi have recently received  a commitment from Ugandan President  Museveni to negotiate their participation  in the Burundi peace process. This milestone was achieved after women's groups  organized a conference in Uganda to discuss peace-building strategies for reconciling differences between the diverse peoples  of Burundi. So far, women's groups have  been barred from meetings organized by  the Burundi government to find a solution  to the 7 year long war that has been raging  between the Hutus and the Tutsis. Since  1993, thousands of Tutsis have been killed  and held captive by members of the President's party, primarily represented by  Hutus. Compiled from www.aviva.org.  Ceremonial Hand  Over of FGM Knives  Opponents of female circumcision in  Guinea are welcoming a recent decision by  hundreds of women who practice the circumcising of young girls, to hand over their  special ceremonial knives. Haja Wudu  Barrie, spokeswoman for the campaign to  end female genital mutilation, told state  radio that the gesture was a breakthrough  after 14 years of campaigning. Opponents  of the practice have denounced female  genital mutilation operations as health  risks, and violations to the human rights  of women and children. Compiled from  www.aviva.org.  Plan to Move 300  Million Peasants  Starting in the year 2002, the Chinese  government plans to resettle 300 million  peasants into 10,000 new towns over a five  year period. The government's goal for this  resettlement is to increase consumer demand and boost the economy. The cost will  come in well over $300 billion in housing,  infrastructure and household goods. This  new plan is an ironic contrast to the resettlement that took place in China during the  Cultural Revolution when tens of millions  of urban residents were moved to the countryside to work on the land.  Recently, resettlements of 3 million  people from behind the Three Gorges Dam  being built on the Yangtze river led to recurring disputes between locals and police.  Residents are concerned their quality of life  will be severely threatened, and point to  previous relocation programs that have left  many women, children and families in poverty, as confirmation for their fears. Urban  councils are also facing environmental  problems from the new resettlement plan  in the form of air pollution and inadequate  sanitation systems. Last year, only 2/3 of  Beijing's sewage was treated.

The radio station  has been named Dzimwe Community Radio. Of recent concern to rural mothers has  been the influence tourists have had on  their young sons and daughters. They discovered their sons are earning income far  greater than local fishing incomes can provide and they have been receiving gifts  from tourists. After investigation, mothers  discovered that their sons were involved  in gay relationships with men and feared  their daughters were involved in prostitution.

Alejandra Matus and  Pinochet "Black  Book" Banned  Alejandra Matus' 'The Black Book of  Chilean Justice' outlining Pinochet's dictatorship is still banned and the author, Ms.  Matus, continues her exile in the US. Despite Ms. Matus' appeal to the Inter American Commission of Human Rights, the  Chilean government has not responded to  the order issued by the commission to ensure her personal safety and freedom of  expression. Ms. Matus' book pointedly  describes the "corruption, nepotism and  abuse of power by members of the High  Court." The book also focuses on the judiciary's lack of independence which deprived thousands of people of legal protection and ultimately cost them their lives.  Under the Domestic Security Law of 1990,  'any publication or broadcast which 'offends' the president, his ministry, generals  or judges can be deemed a crime and its  author liable to 5 years in prison'.

Protesters Call for  GMO Labelling  Over 130 country delegates are meeting in Montreal at a UN convention to hash  out an agreement on genetically modified  organisms. Canada in conjunction with  other grain-exporting nations does not  want any restrictions on the movement of  genetically modified foods. The convention  has been met with protesters who are  putting pressure on delegates to label  GMOs. However, the labelling of GMOs  has been a controversial step among some  protesters who feel that GMOs should be  banned altogether. Women from the South  have repeatedly demanded the abolition of  GMOs as Southern markets are often buyers. Labelling of GMOs will allow people  in First World countries to choose other  food alternatives, but does not eliminate the  contamination of fields in the South, where  many of the crops are grown and consumed.

Thousands  of women are still living under desperate  conditions and the atrocities proceed unabated. A prime example is the recent public stadium execution of Zareena, a mother  of seven children, incriminated for killing  her husband. Zareena is the first woman to  be publicly murdered, however, many have  been openly beaten and tortured over the  slightest perceived infraction.  The Taliban literally has a strangle hold  on the lives of Afghan women. Self-designated henchmen roam the streets looking  for any hint of unholiness. Outward signs  of femaleness are deemed to be a gross violation of their patriarchal creed. Under the  Islamic flag, the Taliban continues to impose a twisted and distorted interpretation  of Islam. Afghan women and girls do not  have access to adequate health or educa  tion. Their every movement outside the  home must be chaperoned by a male relative. In a country that has been at war for  the last two decades, many women are widows and without male relations. As a result, access to income plus daily necessities has forced thousands of women to beg  on the street.  The voices of numerous Afghan  women are being projected through the  Revolutionary Afghan Women's Association (RAWA). As the Taliban and the jehadi  (other fundamentalist factions) continue to  fight for control over various parts of Afghanistan, women and children are  maimed, tortured and killed. RAWA condemns all factions on the basis of violence.  RAWA is organizing another International Women's Day forum in Pakistan to  expose the gross human rights violations  against Afghan women. Last year, RAWA  commemorated IWD by hosting a series of  women to speak about the issues faced by  Afghan women. In addition, there were letters, poems and a student play depicting  the destruction of Afghanistan and her people. Over a thousand people participated  in last year's event including Afghan and  Pakistani democratic organizations. This  year, the event is scheduled to be even bigger in an attempt to bring the international  community out of its indifference and into  action.  RAWA is asking for international support to end the violence in Afghanistan.  Monetary donations are being collected to  sponsor Afghan women to attend the conference in Pakistan. Funds will also be apportioned to the event itself.  Georgina Farah is a Canadian Afghan woman  who's working in solidarity with women in Afghanistan.

Their Spirit Lives  Within Us  Each year on Valentines' Day, women  come together to organize a march to commemorate women who have died violent  deaths in the Downtown Eastside. Many  of these women are forgotten and ignored  in society. The march is held to honour  them for who they were: mothers, daughters, sisters and friends.  For the ninth time, the Women's Memorial March will be held in the Downtown Eastside. The March was first organized after the murder of a First Nations  woman in the Downtown Eastside. She  was murdered by someone from outside  of the community. This murder was the  catalyst that motivated the community to  take action against the increased violence  and murders of women who live in the  Downtown Eastside.  The Women's Memorial March is held  on February 14th, a day that is universally  chosen to express LOVE. February 14th is a  day to remember all women who have died  from violent acts and put a stop to it!  The Women's Memorial March is not  strictly a First Nations march. A woman  Elder is designated to lead the march with  prayers, smudging and the placement of a  rose at the known sites where women have  died. It is important that the territory be  acknowledged to the rightful owners.  Musqueam, Burrard and Squamish people  have been in this territory from time immemorial. We thank you for allowing us  to hold our march on this land.  It is important that women show their  strength by marching together. Most of the  violent acts against women are perpetrated  by men. It is meaningful for women to feel  safe and not feel the need for men to be at  their side to act as protectors. Men are requested to respect the structure of the  march as follows: women Elders, women  drummers, women and minor children,  women and their partners, and male drummers.  The Women's Memorial March is one  event for the community to come together  and share grief for women in an open, supportive, caring and respectful manner.  The Women's Memorial March will  start at Carnegie Centre, 600 Main St (at  Hastings) at noon. People from the community, many of whom have lost daughters, mothers, sisters and friends to violence  in the Downtown Eastside, will share their  stories, their memories, their songs . The  march will leave Carnegie at 1:00pm and  travel through the streets of the community,  stopping at locations where women have  died to leave a rose in remembrance and a  smudge for healing. The march will wind  up at Oppenheimer Park, and then participants will be invited to the Japanese Language Hall for a sharing of food.  If you would like more information or  would like to participate in organizing the  March, contact Mariene Trick at the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre at (604) 681-  4786 or the Breaking the Silence Against Violence Campaign at (604) 682-3269, ext. 8319.  Mariene Trick of the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre presented this herstory of the Women's Memorial March.  Women's Global  Strike  The International Women Count Network, based in Ireland, has called for a  Women's Global Strike for March 8,2000.  The Strike organizers have put out a  call for participation and strike demands  saying the motivation for the action is the  reality that 'Women are working harder and  harder doing both traditional and non-traditional work while trying to juggle the  market's ruthless demands, their homes  and personal lives."  Some demands endorsed so far include  the abolition of Third World Debt, accessible clean drinking water in developing  countries, low cost housing and transportation, protection against violence, global  pay equity and wages for all caring work.  A strike leaflet is available in a wide  variety of languages. T-shirts, badges and  postcards are produced as strike  fundraisers and are available in English.  The strike organizing group can be contacted through their website http://  womanstrike8m.serverl01.com.

NAC Prods  Government  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women presented the House  Standing Committee on Finance with  strong criticism on childcare, maternity  benefits and housing issues for women.  NAC president Joan Grant-Cummings was  quoted as saying that "Clearly the government has a long way to go on women's economic rights. The issue of childcare is an  integral and critical component to women's  access within the economy and our ability  to control our destinies. The government  must act in the budget year 2000-2001 to  implement a new social program. We believe this must be the long promised National Childcare Program".  Ms. Grant-Cummings also pointed out  the inherent discrimination in the new  Employment Insurance guidelines against  women, particularly those that are self-  employed.  For more information, contact Joan Grant-  Cummings at (416) 992-0064 or your local  NAC.  Calgary 25 Year  Research Project  The Calgary Status of Women Action  Committee (CSWAC) is hosting a participatory research project that will document  the past 25 years of women's rights organizing in the Calgary area. The CSWAC  project will recognize the many unwritten  stories of struggle and success by developing a publication, an archival collection and  an interactive web site. The project will  depict grass roots activism that lead to institutional change in an often stifling and  conservative political climate.

Today at age 56, she has produced  four books documenting the links between  race, class and gender in Americans part  of the global systems of oppression. Currently, Professor Davis teaches at the University of Santa Cruz in the History of  Conciousness Department but keeps  strong ties with various departments in the  network of universities in California.  Tracking Angela through the bright  screen of the cyberworld, the dated and  cropped 1970's image of a Black female  radical is repeated on the screen. Cyberland  has not caught up with her in the present  and I wonder why this 'eternal youth' media culture refuses to let her live in the  present tense. The issues she speaks to are  old, new and never finished.  In numerous interviews, points she  makes are intentionally redirected back to  the flashpoint of 1971.1 have wondered if  keeping her as a 'radical/Black Power style'  revolutionary subtly becomes a way of  keeping us at a distance from the state of  emergency existing now. In the few short  articles I could find, it is clear to her (as it  should be to us) that we need to stop idealizing the '60's and find new methods in  the 1990's and beyond, of critical and potent activism.  In a discussion with an acquaintance,  I wondered why audiences insist on bombarding well-known activists with the  question of "What are we to do?"  I certainly do not know how Angela  Davis responds to that question; however  I wonde, is it that we refuse or are unable  to make the links on our own personal and  local levels? One student reporter, after a  Davis speech at the University of North  Carolina was only inspired to reflect on the  Agenda'. I would like to ask that fellow  student "Who's agenda, sister,and, does  staring at it create change?" This particular writer ended her article stating an inability to offer a solution in "good conscience" and mused that she and her peers  are part of the problem.  Is that all we have to say in response?  Is that all the inheritors of the future  have to say to the prominent hard working activists (of all walks of life and colours) doing the organizing? When do we  make supportive networks with the activism they do- whether in the prisons, on the  street, in the unions or on the campuses?  In her latest book, Blues Legacies and  Black Feminism, Dr. Davis continues the  analysis presented in Women, Race and Class  (written in 1988). The book exemplifies  Professor Davis' ability to analyze not only  academic, archival resources, but also the  poetry/oral text from a different era and  contextualize it within the academic language of today.  Professor Davis draws from the sound  and sensation of the oral text documented  on vinyl and on CD to present the roots of  Black working class feminism. To her  credit, she has painstakingly transcribed  manuscripts of Black women's lives as sung  and lyricized by three Blues singers  Gertrude 'Ma' Rainey Bessie Smith and  Billie 'Lady Day' Holiday. In her own words  from an interview, Prof. Davis says "I decided to treat women's blues as texts that  might reveal something very different from  the ideas on race and gender we associate  with historical [Bjlack women we have located in [Bjlack feminist traditions. I have  found women's blues to be a very rich site  for the examination of a [Bjlack working-  class^ feminist conciousness that in many  ways foreshadowed the women's movement of the 1970's."  Since the 1970's, Professor Davis has  consistently pointed our attention to globalization of capital, human rights and the  increased incarceration of people of colour  and the building of capitalist economies on  prison labour. She will give the speech  "Women, Punishment and Globalization"  at the Vogue on Feb. 12th.  What does that have to do with us on  the Pacific West coast of Canada anyways?  A quarterly magazine called  ColourLines (devoted to Race, Culture and  Action) printed "Masking Racism: Reflections on the Prison Industrial Complex" by  Dr. Davis. Edna Toth posted the article on  her Canadian website to alerts us that several provincial governments are contemplating  bringing the private prison system to Canada.  In this article, Professor Davis identifies links between the breakdown of social  assistance systems, insecure job environments and the increased incarceration of  people for non-violent crimes. Even the  most mainstream of us in Canada have an  awareness of the first two issues; however,  we may ask, "What does US prison labour  have to do with me?"  Simply put, many of our purchases are  produced by prisoner's labour . IBM,  Motorola, Revlon, Compaq, Microsoft,  Pierre Cardin and Boeing are a few such  companies invested in the structure of nongovernment prison complexes—a whole  separate, private capitalist industry. Within  the article Dr. Davis makes space for research done by Eve Goldberg and Linda  Evans that reveals "prisoners do data entry for Chevron, make telephone reservations for TWA, make circuit boards, and  [even] lingerie for Victoria's Secret."  At the doors of the Vogue, we can be  certain that the audience won't be strip  searched or questioned on the brand name  of cell phones or lipstick. The list clarifies  that Angela's message is not only 'Made for  the USA.' These issues, products and companies have relevance to anyone within the  global market. As secured buyers of American products we can be VERY sure anything  she has to say on the subject of this hidden  labour force has something to do with us.  These are some realities directly related  to globalization of which Professor Davis  will speak to in Vancouver. Dr. Davis'  speech promises to give us more insight on  these critical issues. It is up to us, as we  walk into the street at the end of the night,  to take responsible action within our part  of the hemisphere.

Black feminist language  by Lilly McShine  It was not until I was asked to write  this article that I began to realize how my  long-distance admiration for this majestic  Black sister has never really waned.  I questioned myself. What should I  write? I can only hope to do justice to what  she has come to represent. Her life's work  reflects Black women's capacity for being  resistant survivors in the latter half of the  twentieth century.  It is necessary to bring home the significance of Angela's activism righthere in  Canada in order to prepare us for another  phase of struggle. I also believe that in order to understand the new systemic racism  in all of its multi-complex forms, it is important to reflect on the past to understand  the present. The struggle must continue far  into the next century.  Although historians like Xavier  Garneau denied that slavery ever existed  in Canada, others merely excluded Black  people from Canadian history altogether.  Conversely, other writers like D.R. Taylor  illustrate its existence.  Mr. Taylor states, "Black history in  Canada begins with slavery One of the earliest records of this in Canada shows a slave  arriving in 1604. The slave presence in  Canada was not large, but it was there, although it is not easy to find in history  books. It helped alleviate the shortage of  labour in New France and in the 18th century many families coming to Nova Scotia  and New Brunswick from the USA brought  their slaves with them. Slavery resulted in  an overall loss of human dignity and identity (i.e. culture, language, history).  By the mid 1900s the [institutionalized] racism with its scientific racist ideologies was embodied in a Black-white  paradigm. Segregation was firmly entrenched in all systems/institutions across  the United States, an overall systemic exclusion that is so well articulated in Davis'  autobiography (1975).  Moreover, bell hooks, Davis and other  writers have expressed poignant examples  where many Black women, men and children did not see themselves as victims. In  the face of hardship, economic deprivation  and the cruel injustices of racial segregation, they gained strength by sharing  knowledge and resources rather than submitting to the realities of state-legislated  racial oppression.  Within a Canadian context, racism  manifests itself in immigration policies and  even Black Canadian children being segregated in schools in Nova Scotia and Ontario  up to the 1960s.  Aboriginal women and Black women  were denied voting rights well into the  1960s. This exclusion and mistreatment was  justified on the grounds that human behaviour and characteristics reflected 'natural'  hierarchies based on genetic differences between categories of persons identified by  race.  In any movement, [such as the Civil  Rights Movement], women have always  been at the forefront of front and foremost  in the struggle for change. Yet at the end of  the day, the voices, faces and ideas of men.  As one of the lanterns of the Civil  Rights movement, Angela Davis' voice and  courage stands out to me as someone who  will never be silenced. Her voice continues to articulate the overall structures of  global oppression (old and new) and the  universal context of the Black white paradigm which does not imply homogeneity  of experience. The histories and struggles  of Black Caribbean, African, American, Canadian, Aboriginal and Asian women are  mediated by different experiences with racism. As a Black feminist, Angela's numerous works (Women, Race and Class; Blues  Legacies and Black Feminism and The Angela  Y. Davis Reader) reminds us of the interconnections of race, class, and gender oppression.  Moreover, she has instructed us to be  cognizant of racism as a fundamentally  Black feminist issue because of its  interconnectedness with work and family  in the context of a capitalist, white  supremacist society. Her ongoing activism  is an example of women's power to resist  domination. Indeed, iitis a testimony to all  women of the continuing need to educate  ourselves and each other for change.  This is Lilly McShine's first time writing for  Kinesis.  FEBRUARY 2000 Social work research in Jamaica  The effects of migra tion on children  by Claudette P.J.Crawford-Brown as  told to Nadine Chambers   In the 1960s and 70s, Jamaican women  emigrated for their labour as domestics to  Canada. Social worker, Claudette Crawford  identified a connection between the migration of women and its negative impact on  children.  Shifting patterns of  migration  I have been looking at the issue of migration for some time because of its impact  on children.  As chairperson of the Children's Lobby  (a group set up at the University of the West  Indies to advocate for the rights of Jamaican children), we  have found  that the impact of migration on  children and  families has  not really  been centre  stage in  terms of the  socio-cul-  tural dynamics of  Caribbean  society. For  the last ten  years, I have  been looking  at migration  patterns his-  torically.  There has  been a shift  in patterns of  migration to and from the Caribbean. Historically, the First World has provided employment opportunities for Caribbean people and the first wave occurred in the post  World War II era. The nature of migration  reflected more men leaving building roads,  bridges - leaving behind women and children. [Then] the migration doors to Britain  closed and the doors to North America  opened in the '60's. There was a difference  in Canada and the US - the shift was more  towards employment of females (domestic workers). I suggest that this historical  fact of the women leaving and migrating  in larger number^ has caused a shift in the  household organization of the Caribbean  family.  Whereas in the first wave, children  were left with grandmothers and mothers;  now the women are no longer leaving the  children with grandparents. Grandparents  have become busier and become younger  and we have found, particularly in the last  10 years the emergence of a phenomenon  called 'barrel children of the Caribbean'. I  looked mainly at Jamaica, and I define barrel children as children waiting to rejoin  their parents. They are sent gifts, in corrugated cardboard barrels, of material goods  in terms of sneakers, clips and clothing.  Unfortunately, some of them, who have  migrated parents lack the emotional  nuturing that they need.  If grandmothers are not there, children  are left with friend or arbitrary individuals, and the child-care arrangements are not  as tight as they used to be. [This] is beginning to create social problems and a new  phenomenon in our schools, in our community life. I also looked at the  reunification- when the children rejoin their  family abroad. My paper discusses that and  looks in terms of what happens in the dynamics in the family.  There were variables like  the number of times a  child moved, the number  of parenting arrangements that the child  had—those were all  interacting variables that  impacted on this issue.  The  study  study did  not start [by  looking] at  migration,  it was actually a thesis  on criminal  behaviour  in adolescent males.  It was a  small uni-  versify  study done  for a PhD  thesis, so  the limitations of  sampling  restricted one from looking at it broadly.  One cannot, I repeat cannot, generalize about the entire Jamaican population on  the basis of this study. It simply gave me  an understanding of where the problem  might be coming from, and there is need  for greater study in this area. I studied a  group of kids in a home for delinquent kids,  and I looked at a controlled group of 70 kids  who were not delinquent. When I looked  at the histories of these children, I found  quite by accident that there was a disproportionate number of kids in the 'conduct  disorderly' group who had absent mothers. I found the 'absence of mother' variable quite significant. When I looked at the  reason for the absence of mother, the main  problem was death of parent, the second  was migration. It suggests that when  mother is not there, the children drop  through the cracks and get into trouble.  Whether it is through mother dying, or  through mother being away due to migration or health reasons (which I also looked  at); or other reasons the child gets into difficulty. It is a well known fact that mother  has a unique role in most families- and so  it is in the Caribbean. When mother is not  there, somehow there is less protection for  the childrenand the children fall through  the cracks much faster - this is what I am  suggesting is happening to us in the Caribbean.  The absence of  father, mother and  other variables  The other issue is the absence of father in the majority of poor Jamaican households. This sample was taken from children  in low socio-economic groupings of society. The reality is that there are many of  these families where father is absent and  when mother is not there either - it makes  sense that the child is going to get into trouble. The other reality was the children who  were so-called 'normal' were living with  grandparents or aunties who were stable  in their lives. Variables like the number of  times a child moved, the number of  parenting arrangements that the child had  - those were all interacting factors that  impacted on this issue. [From the data I recognized a co-related] increase in incidents  of conduct disorder and the severity of conduct disorder.  I looked at boys. One of the things  when you are doing a study like this is the  quantitative piece. I will never forget what  the boys said to me about how they missed  father and  how they  wanted to  have a father  to identify  with closely.  As a parent  myself who is  bringing up a  young boy, I  am not so sure  that I would  conclude that  mother       is  But the variable of  'absence of mother'  'was disporportionately  more in the conduct  disorder group.  more important. It is simply that when  mother is  missing there  are certain problems that result, and when  father is missing there are also problems  that result. My study did not attempt to  weight it. The absence of father variable  was very similar for the control group and  my experimental group. In both groups, delinquent and non- delinquent, the father  was absent, but the variable of 'absence of  mother' was disproportionately more in  the conduct disorder group.  Foreign goods in  the lives of barrel  children  There is a video done by the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] on barrel  children and a study done at ISER [Institute for Social and Economic Research],  looking at the issue of informal commercial importers and the value placed on imported goods in Jamaican society.  In my research, for example, a child in  Montego Bay, was sent a barrel and the  goods were sold. The child was to use the  money to take care of himself. On one occasion, the mother forgot to send the money  or the money was not sent on time. The  guidance counsellor had to call the mother  in North America to say that this child  could not live by himself.  The child was 14 years old, well behaved and not creating problems, but he  was looking after himself . We (the children's advocacy groups) are worried when  children are turned into 'little higglers'  (street marketers). It's a way of coping and  many people from the Caribbean would  understand this better than North Americans. When mothers do this it is for sheer survival. They don't want to stay away from  the children but the years of filing papers  takes a very long time. Sometimes mothers will leave their children from age three  and not see the child again until age thirteen.  It is not because they love to do it, but  they do it because they have to do it.  These are some of the new pressures  in the Caribbean, namely the structural adjustment policies that have come up as a  result of the  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ International  Monetary  Fund (IMF).  Families have  had to sit  down and say  "Mother will  go because  she will get a  job, I will stay  and look after  the children  and she send  the money to  look after the  mortgage."  That is what is  happening,  there is an underground economy which is keeping families alive. Many people do not understand  that the remittances sent back are what  keeps Jamaican families afloat.  Market fQrtheymaybeillegaland fearthe  It is not just remittances, it's the actual  goods, In some of the best schools, children will be selling watches and sweets in  order to buy food. Many of the children I  know are doing very well, they don't market in the street, it is done under the desk,  very discreetly. This is not something I  want to pathologize. I think we should be  aware of it as there are some cases when  the child is not doing so well. We need to  follow through with social work assistance,  help to that household and substitute  caregivers. The economists in my own department in the University of the West  Indies understand the social problems that  the machinations and adaptations families  make are a result of larger economic problems. Until those problems are dealt with  we are "sucking salt through a wooden  spoon."  Abandonmen  issue*  About the issue of abandonment, the  initial paper  was done with  my colleague  Melrose  Rattray. We  suggested that  the child goes  through a  number of  losses. The first  loss is when  mother leaves,  if the child is  left with a  grandmother,  and then when  the child leaves  [grandmother]  to rejoin the  mother. In my  quantitative  work there are  cases of youngsters who react  very tragically.  It depends on  the personality  of the child. In  one case an  eight year old  tried to commit  suicide by  jumping out of  a train on his way from the airport. I've discussed the way in which information is  passed on to the child about the migration.  Very often, parents try to keep it a secret  until the last minute. The child is the last  one to know, the parents can't let anybody  know they are travelling. In some cases,  US/Canadian government finding  SUTV! Val out; so children do not have contact. When there is reunification,  children don't know that parent.  This is well documented in the literature in Canada when the Caribbean child comes at a later stage.  This is what we call serial migration- the family doesn't migrate  in total as you have in middle class  families. In the working class situation, mother goes first, gets a job,  gets sponsorship and then sends  for the children and her husband.  Because of the nature of this migration it is an integral problem  within the system. You have the  abandonment, you have the  reunification and you have other  have issues with a child coming up  into a family that is already set up. Blending  or reconstituting families, a child comes with  a Jamaican accent - the child is seen as inferior to the siblings who have an American  accent and the children are treated differently.  So you have a child plucked out of the  hinterland of Jamaica, Antigua or Trinidad  and placed in the middle of Montreal, New  York or Newark, without any preparation or  orientation. Of-  These are some of the new pressures in the  Caribbean, namely the structural adjustment  policies that have come up as a result of the  IMF. Families have had to sit down and say'  "Mother will go because she will get a job, I I  will stay and look after the children and she  send the money to look after the mortgage."  ten these children are shell  shocked, so I  have advocated  orientation programs for them.  I support new  arrival programs. There is  one functioning  in the Hartford,  Connecticut area  where the school  system sets up a  new arrivals  program which  helps the children to get settled. They can  cope when they  have support  systems and can  talk about being  away from what  is familiar.  Previously  the metropolitan  country (the receiving country)  tended  to see  Afro-Caribbean  peoples as African-Americans or Black Canadian and did  not realized that there are very strong and  clear differences.

Some of these mothers are illegal so it  takes time to get legalized as a  resident.There is tremendous guilt and  absolute agony that many mothers go  through. Some of the recommendations  that have been made relate to the use of  the new technologies and would allow  children to connect with their parents. I  was in New York recently and saw an  agency where people can pay and talk to  their children on-line and have their pictures live. It started at Christmas time, it  is now an ongoing service to families. This  is something I would like to suggest be  dealt with through social services.

North American  media's  interpretation of  the study  How my research is interpreted, I  find ties into the agenda of people who  have an [anti-immigrant] perspective in  regards to immigration law in North  America - for example the First World media. We can say the way in which the immigration laws are structured impacts  negatively on the Caribbean family.

I  want to highlight the fact that we are beginning to see in the past decade or more a  shift in the nature of the pattern of migration, and in turn this has impacted on the  family negatively. I am in a field [social  work] that can have some influence. When  I look at it on both sides, harm is done in  the receiving country as well as the country of origin. This is where the globalization comes in, because social workers on  both sides need to understand what is occurring. Many lectures and seminars I do  in the Hartford area revolve around encouraging and supporting cross-cultural communication. Social workers here are beginning to talk to social workers in the Caribbean and actively work to share case studies. We can talk about what is happening  because many people here [NorthAmerica]  are not clear on how to deal with [Caribbean] people because they don't use the  social services, because they react differently or they don't fit the expectations. We  in the Caribbean know what is going on,  so if we can address these problems earlier  it would improve the quality of these children's lives.

[Contact  Kinesis for more information] Feature  FROM  USA  An odyssey from shame to pride  Living deliberately  by Mowani Carter  I've hung out in so many closets. Feeling naked and afraid, I have covered myself with blankets of invisibility. I have  walked sidewalks of eggshells, wearing my  closet like comfortable old shoes. Many  times, I chose the beiges and grays of acceptance when I should have blinded my  audience with purples, reds, mauves and  primrose.  Chicago's African American Gay &  Lesbian community spared me the trauma  of the butch/femme closet. Shielded from  the disapproval of the politically correct  Lesbian Feminist movement, with its hysterical outlook on "roles," I was free to be  what I was born to be - a femme. In my  circle, stud (butch)/femme was a given.  There was no explanation/justification required or expected. If a femme got asked  for a slow dance, it was a stud doing the  asking and we ALWAYS knew who was going to lead.  Although I've never lived in the  "femme closet," I've had other doors to  open. I have lived most of my life choking  on the bile spewed from my community  of origin; a homophobic community that  taunts and ostracizes its children with  words like, "bulldagger," "funny," "hell-  fire," "damnation," and "abomination." It  would take years before my bloody and  battered knuckles finally decided to hammer away at that door. Coming out as a  lesbian has not been  easy, but neither has  it killed me. It has  been my personal  odyssey from shame  to pride.  When I first  poked my head out  of the closet, I was literally SLAPPED  back inside. It would  be 15 years before I  ventured out again.  Ironically, the slap  was from the hands  of one who professed to love me—  my first female lover.  I remember it like it  was yesterday. When  I met Raynell, I was  (un)comfortably  married.  Living in close  proximity to Raynell  made for some scary  moments. Yet these near misses from juggling a marriage and a woman lover only  added to the exhilaration. Although I had  convinced myself that this was just an experiment, I wound up leaving my husband. I got my own apartment and continued to see Raynell. I even introduced her  to my family who accepted my new  "friend" with nary a questioning glance.  My husband got his revenge. Without  revealing his own clandestine and on-going affair with the wife of one of our closest friends, he made the rounds to my fam  ily members. He told everyone who would  listen about my new, "wild" life style and  his suspicion that I was hanging out with a  "bulldagger."  I was the "Golden Child", the baby of  the family. All my life, I was showered with  love. I was valued and precious. My family listened to my husband, thanked him  for his visit, and continued to treat me and  Raynell as just good, girlfriends. That was  about to change.  It was a Saturday night. Raynell and I  had joined [my siblings and friends] for a  night of partying. I was surrounded by my  family AND my new love. I felt good!  One of my brother's friends started  hitting on me. [Raynell] began to go ballistic about "me flirting with that man." A little tipsy, I started to laugh at the absurdity  of it all. The next thing I knew, she slapped  me—Hard!  I was stunned. I'd never, ever, been  slapped. After all, I was the baby of the family, the creme de la creme. I couldn't stop  wailing, despite her abject apologies and  protestations of "I don't know what came  over me." Finally I tried to compose myself. I went back to join my family. It was  obvious that I had been crying.  Of course, everybody started asking  questions. I blurted out, "Raynell slapped  me." Well, the buzzing and humming  reached a crescendo. I heard my brother  whisper to my sister, "See, I TOLD you." I  instinctually knew  what he'd told. My  beautiful bubble had  burst. My forbidden  fruit had turned rotten. I no longer felt  loved, valued and  precious. I felt so  ashamed.  Although one  of my sisters said to  my brother, "Whatever it is, it's none of  your business." Two  of my sisters took  me out to the car to  help me re-arrange  myself. One was  strangely silent. So  was I. How could I  tell them that I was  lovers with a  woman and she was  jealous of a man?  The heavy oppression of the closet had  begun.  Fast forward to the nineties. The dawn  of a new millennium. New loves, new experiences, an acceptance of who I really am.  Consciousness-raising time.  I can't recall ever making a conscious,  deliberate choice to "shout from the  rooftops" about my life (although many  times in the glow of a new romance, I certainly felt like it!): My journey was more  subtle—dropping causal remarks in "safe"  circles—showing up with my "date" at  "safe" occasions, only bringing out that cer-  In the end, when all  the hymns have been  sung, all the  remembrances  shared, the epitaph  "She did it her way" is  much more appealing  than—"She died as  she lived—Afraid!"  tain photo album for certain visitors and,  removing telling photos for others. My  coming out process was in dribs and drabs.  It was so draining. I expended so much energy in being afraid.  What really pushed me from the closet  was anger. One day, like the ringing of a  clear bell, a thought occurred to me. Out of  all the people I was avoiding "offending",  not one of them was going to step up and  take my place with the Grim Reaper. This  logic, gloomy as it may sound, stopped me  dead in my tracks-if my oppressors were  not willing to DIE FOR ME, why should I  be willing to LIVE FOR THEM?  My anger intensified. I realized that  this unnamed "They" were living in whatever ways that suited them, or as my  mother would say, "doing everything  they're big enough to do," (and in many  cases, making quite a mess of it!).  I still remember my first tentative step  back out of the closet. A straight friend was  once again trying to "fix me up." Taking a  deep breath I said, "Oh, it would have to  be with a woman, because I'm a lesbian."  The earth didn't tremble. She didn't gasp  in horror and run screaming from the room.  What did happen was she said, "Well, I  wish I knew a woman suitable. You're such  a great person, you deserve the best." It was  totally liberating!  Since that time, I continue to "out"  myself. Most of the things I'd worried about  haven't happened. The whispers from  some family members have been balanced  by the unconditional love of others. Some  friends (in their own version of "don't ask,  don't tell") chose to ignore my life's reality.  However, what I lost was not as important  as what I gained. I have realized that the  bogey man is my own internalized fear. I  have realized that my closets are of my own  making. I have realized that to live a fulfilled life, I must free myself, both from  within and without.  In her book, "Homophobia: A Weapon  of Sexism," Suzanne Pharr mentions two  women holding hands walking on a beach  a thousand miles from home. As soon as  they see a couple and a child walking towards them, they drop their hands. In this  image, I recognized myself. It has stayed  with me for many years. It helps me understand that I can be my own worse oppressor every time I say "Yes" to internalized homophobia.  In my continuing road to liberation, I  try to keep one fact in the forefront of my  mind. Only one person can choose how I  live my life—ME! This is not my "lifestyle,"  it's my life. It's the only one that I have, and  therefore, infinitely precious. Accepting  myself has proven to be much more life-  affirming than the acceptance of others.

The goal of the Programme is to increase the representation of Indigenous Nova  Scotian Blacks and Mi'kmaq in the legal profession by making  Dalhousie Law School more accessible to applicants from these  two communities. Dalhousie Law School, after wide consul  tation with the public, recognized the problem of under-repre-  sentation of Indigenous Blacks and Mi'kmaq in the legal profession in Nova Scotia and has decided to take steps to ensure that  this situation of historical inequality is overcome.  Our primary step is to recruit more students from the Black  and Mi'kmaq communities and to provide these students with  academic support during law school. We also committed ourselves to a modification of the present legal educational system  by introducing minority or previously excluded perspectives on  the legal system. Hence, we are committed to the recruitment of  law teachers from the Indigenous Black and Mi'kmaq communities; or failing that, from other minority communities in Canada.  We believe that this combination of strategies can address  most effectively the needs of minority communities and the demand to make the legal profession more accessible and representative. It is important to stress that the degree requirements  for the Programme participants are no different than for any other  student. All must complete the same examinations, papers, and  courses.  Taken from the website for the Dalhousie Law Programme for  Indigenous Blacks and Mi'kmaq  Carol Aylward as told to Nadine  Chambers   Any Canadian Black History issue  would be incomplete without the acknowledgement of the centuries old relationship  between aboriginal people and people of  African desent in Nova Scotia. Carol  Aylward graciously agreed to an interview  with Kinesis on this exciting 10 year old alliance.  Nadine: What are your reflections on the  media response to the Law Society of Upper  Canada's actions regarding diversity in 1998?  Carol: My reflections are more on the  Law Society of Upper Canada's lack of a  complete explanation to the media and the  general public regarding the reasons behind its action.  The issue was one of 'diversity' in the  broad sense, however, the real issue was the  'standard' applied for a 'pass' in the Bar  Admissions Course. Up until just recently,  the 'pass' requirement for the Bar Admissions Course in Ontario was 55.1 myself  graduated from the Bar Admissions Course  under this standard, as did every lawyer  practicing in Ontario, and elsewhere, who  had taken the Bar Admissions Course in  Ontario.  For reasons not fully explained, and  smacking of 'gate keeper' function, the Law  Society of Upper Canada changed the  standard 'pass' mark from 55 to a 'norm  referencing' standard. This means that instead of every student having to make a 55  or better on a Bar Admissions examination,  the pass mark would depend on the highest mark attained by a student attending  the Course.  In other words, if the highest mark  achieved in a course was an 85 then the pass  mark became an 85 and anyone below that  mark would fail the course. Since the pass  mark in the recent past was 55 (and students who attained this mark were qualified), the Law Society of Upper Canada, in  the diversity debate, concluded that 'norm  referencing' had an adverse impact on  many groups taking the Bar Admissions  Course, including French-speaking students, Aboriginal students, racial minority  students and so on. Consequently, they decided to 'pass' those students who had attained the former 55 mark standard, in recognition of the adverse impact, and in recognition of the fact that all (now practicing  lawyers) who had attained this standard  were 'qualified'.  The racial minority and other students  (including white students) who had met  this qualification in the 1995 year (where  there was an inordinately high failure rate  at the bar) were also qualified and should  not be penalized.  The Law Society of Upper Canada had  determined that it needed to take another  look at 'norm referencing' as the appropriate standard to be applied in future.  Nadine: How was it publicized? What  impression was given ?  Carol: The Law Society ot Upper  Canada, and consequently, the media did  not explain this position to the public and  consequently, the public was left with the  impression that the Society was passing or  pushing through sub-standard racial minority      students,  rather than address- ^mMOOtS^^BtOO  ing a faulty standard.  Indeed, the impression left by the  Society and the media  was that only racial  minority students  were affected when in  fact white students  were also impacted  by the implementation of this 'new'  standard. My point is  that a false and detrimental impression  was left out there  when the Law Society  and the media could  have made it clear  that the issue was not  'diversity' but 'improper standards' being employed by the  Law Society of Upper Canada.  The question remains why this impression was allowed to remain and why it was  accepted? I believe that it was easier for the  Law Society to give the impression that it  was focusing on 'diversity' than to admit  that its standard was inappropriate in a licensing body, exclusionary in its effect, and  adverse in its impact.  Nadine: What is the cross-section of students with regard to women?  Carol: The Indigenous Blacks and  Mi'kmaq Programme students have, on  Making demands on  legal education and  recognize their  unique position in  Canadian society as  Aboriginal women  occasion, been predominantly women and  many single mothers. Many, if not all, of  these students have been at the intersection of race, gender, and class oppression  and therefore unable to separate or bi-fur-  cate themselves. They have a special interest in not just gender issues but in  intersectionality issues as well.  Making demands on legal education  and the law to recognize their unique position in Canadian society as Black and  Aboriginal women.  Nadine: How does this Programme continue the long-standing relationship between  the Mi'kmaq and African-Canadian communities in Nova Scotia?  CarokThese communities, while experiencing different forms of oppression in  Nova Scotian (and Canadian) society, have  similar experiences as well. They have a  history of joining together to make demands for equal opportunity in education,  as well as in other areas of shared oppression.  The Indigenous Blacks and Mi'kmaq  Programme is not the first combined affirmative action for which these two communities have fought. The Dalhousie University Transition Year Programme (for  equality of opportunity in education in  undergraduate programmes) has been in  effect for over twenty years in response to  persistent and prolonged demands by both  the Black and  Mi'kmaq community.  The Indigenous  Blacks and Mi'kmaq  Programme does continue this long-standing relationship of resistance to the persistence of racism. However, both of these  communities occupy  a unique place in  Nova Scotian and Canadian society and  the oppression experienced by them cannot always be 'remedied' in the same  way.  The Indigenous  Blacks and Mi'kmaq  Programme (while a  ^^^'ñ†^'ñ†^^^^    combined pro  gramme) may not always meet these unique experiences and  demands, but I believe that it strives to deal  with the forms of oppression that are  shared by the two communities while recognizing that one 'solution' does not fit all.  Professor Carol Aylward is the Director of this  unique Law program. An indepth discussion  of the topics mentioned above can be found in  her book "Canadian Critical Race Theory:  Racism and the Law" 1999, Fernwood Publishing, Halifax.  FEBRUARY 2000 Feature from Quebec  Immigrants in the midst of language tensions  Education in Quebec  by Beverly Townsend as told to Mala  Mala: My first question was in terms of  Quebec's history—Immigrants entering its  own tensions around English /French.  Townsend: I am going to speak  from the perspective of the English  community and from the 1970's. That  was when I became part of the system.  The educational system was segregated,  within the two largest school boards in  the province. The Catholics had English  and French schools. The Protestant  school board also had English and  French schools. The other school boards  were either French or English. When  certain changes took place a year ago, all  the French schools were put in one  system and all the English schools in  another.  On another level, lets's talk about  immigrants after immigration boomed  in the early '70's. Prior to that the French  immersion was just set in place in the  Protestant school board of Greater  Montreal. Other school systems had  bilingual schools and early, late and  post immersion occurred in different  school boards.  How did it affect some immigrants  and Blacks? I always maintain that there  are Blacks who are not immigrants,  people often forget that. So, there was a  majority of immigrants who wanted to  learn English, they were coming from  countries , speaking other languages  other than English. When they came  here to get in the mainstream across the  world, what they wanted was to learn or  improve their English. They were not  interested in learning French as the  language of education.  There was a boom in English  schools, the French community found  that their language was at risk. They  passed a law [that] if English students  were here before 1976, they were  allowed to go to English school. What  transpired was any immigrant coming  in had to go to a French school, period.  The only exceptions were Canadian  citizens from another part of Canada;  however, you could get French schooling  regardless.  There were only a couple of ways  you could circumvent French schooling.  One was you could go to a private  school for a year, your first formative  year (like grade 1) and then you could  transfer into English in the public school  onwards.  Then " majority" year of schooling  was in English. Its a very strange and  technical thing. Iif you had a child who  had special needs meaning educational  deficits and had been to a psychologist  and given a K-form , you could then  transferhim or her to an English school  to learn. Now that I question, because it  was possible that child had learning  difficulties in both French and English  . You would be surprised that many  parents used that loophole to put the  children in English school.  Mala: Did you teach special needs  children ?  L-RTissa Farell.Thando Hyman, M.C. Motion and D.J. Power  Townsend: Yes for 10 years in a  high school, and thereafter as an  administrator. Many of the immigrants  did not want French immersion,  however, it was found, or perceived that  the French immersion schools were the  more elite schools, because the higher  achieving kids were able to cope with  the rigorous program. So some wanted  the French school education.  I am now in a public school that is  called an inclusive school with a high  percentage of special need, both  physical and academic. There are not  too many public schools of that nature  where their special needs students are  completely integrated. Same classes  [and] same lunch time, they are, at  times, pulled out for assistance then  filtered back into the regular classroom.  The school that I adminsistered  previously the majority was English-  speaking West Indian or Black Canadians  who lived in the inner cities [whose]  parents had asked for the highest level  of French immersion for their children.  Mala: Could you speak some more  about the last school?  Townsend: If I gave you [a] rough  estimate, about 50 percent of the kids  were either West Indian or from West  Indian parentage.  Then we had 40 percent of the kids  who were from an Asian back ground  [where] their first language was Gujrati,  Hindi or Tamil. They came in [and]  wanted to learn English. Their parents  wanted them to learn excellent French in  order to be in the mainstream.  Understandably, they want their  children to be able to cope in their  business life [and] to be able to function  as a Quebecer, because the kids are born  here from immigrant families. At the  same time many of these parents  sometimes do not speak any French.  So who will help the child with their  homework? We ha[ve] special funding  for a homework program and so we  could bring in outsiders such as puppet  shows and artists in French who would  perform. When you are having fun you  learn faster.  People were surprised [at] how  quickly their children were encouraging  them to speak French. In the past we had  French courses at nights for the parents  to do computers, French or the math  program [in order] to understand the  new math and what the kids were doing  in French. Our parents were quite  involved in the whole curriculum.  Mala: I always wonder how the  children's experiences politicize or educate  the parents in the new society they are in..  Were there other schools outside of your  inner city school doing this?  Townsend: There were other inner  city schools that got involved in other  projects such as poverty and community  learning. Last year though, we were  moving; plus, the school board change[d]  so it [these programs] were not focused  on. Some programs were on hold.  If you want to talk about the effects  on Blacks per se, it is hard to speak for the  whole community. As you know, there is  a Haitian community and a French-  speaking African community who have  not had any language difficulties in the  schools but problems with racism.  There is a group that started the  Quebec Board of Black Educators that  just celebrated 25 years. They challenged  the boards and took on many cases with  children unjustly treated, suspensions,  or placed in special education classes.  One of the problems across the US  and Canada [is that] there is a  predominance of Blacks ending up in  special education classes—over-  represented. It's sad because when you  are dealing with a Black child who does  have special needs, then it takes a fair  amount of proving and [it] is difficult  [for] the parents because they themselves  are skeptical. There are so many issues.  When I came to Montreal, [I] gave a  workshop at McGill on the nuances of  the language and Jamaican dialect. An  English class teacher may not be able to  understand and assume [that] the  children had to go into a special class.  Mala: Your children were born in  Quebec. When you showed up at parent-  teacher meetings you arrived as an educator  and a graduate of McGill. So how was that?  Townsend: It's too bad that one had  to legitimize who you were to get some  of the teachers to respect you and to  accept that the children had their basic  qualities. They were taught to read  early, they're from a family where there  is a strong push towards education, that  was their natural surrounding. One  teacher thought that my son was a new  immigrant who was suffering from  withdrawal. But he was so bright, he  finished his work quickly and was  daydreaming. Because he was  daydreaming he became [to her] an  immigrant child who was not  accustomed to the society and was not  sure of himself. She had not spent five  minutes trying to get to know the child,  to know he was fluently bilingual [born  in Quebec], and way ahead of the class.  A complete term had passed by the time  of the interview.  Mala: How is racism dealt with in the  schools today?  Townsend: There are certain days  when activities occur, like Martin  Luther King's birthday, that promote  dialogue between students from the  diverse communities. Also, March 21st,  the Universal Day for the Elimination of  Racism. There's a program out of our  school Board called "Stop Racism." It is  quite an enormous piece of work with  lots of research, and [this] material has  been sent to every school. Usually, what  you'll hear is "I am not..." then you hear  something that shows the child does not  reckon with those sensibilities.  Now, I am in a predominantly white  school. Situations are not blown out of  proportion but dealt with in a firm way.  I encourage the students to understand  that I do it, not "just because I am Black."  I point out the fact that you don't treat  me like that because I am Principal yet  you use that slur because it is another  child. People like to talk about "my  friends who are Black..." but then they  speak with disrespect about somebody  else.  Its a matter of a way of life, verses  pockets, or who and when, or at a  special time. Racism still exist, sometimes  its quite subtle. That's the challenge.  Since 1966 Beverly Townsend has been living  in Quebec and teaching for 24 years in both  regular and special education classrooms. She  has been an administrator for 11 ofthoseyears.  The last 7 years were spent as Principal of a  Montreal French Immersion Inner City  elementary school.  14  SIS  FEBRUARY 2000 Writers  Writing a Black future  by Nalo Hopkinson as told to Nadine  Chambers   Nadine Chambers: In Brown Girl In the  Ring (BGITR), the world that Ti-Jean and her  mothers live in is linked to the practice of Afro-  Caribbean rituals, most often lumped under the  terminology 'vodun'. Could you speak a bit on  your understanding of the two sides of the same  ritual coin such as Jamaica's myal, connected  to but as a counter-ritual to  obeah.  Nalo Hopkinson: I  used Afro-Caribbean belief  systems as the underpinning  to the events happening in  BGITR. You can find versions of them anywhere in  the world. Here, there are Africans descended from those  captured in the European  slave trade.  In some countries, the  practices of ritual and healing became stigmatized,  dubbed    'black    magic'  (obeah), thought of as intrinsically evil. But any belief  system can be used to harm  or to heal; its use depends on  the user. In  BGITR, Marni  .o   Gros-Jeanne tries to use her  ^   beliefs to act responsibly  o   within  her  community,  JG   while Rudy, the posse boss,  a   is more concerned with how  £   he can use them for his gain.  J} Nadine: In BGITR was  ^ a pepperpot or pelau of accents  which I found jarring. Meaning, the combination of dialects based on speech-  patterns, which are distinctly Jamaican,  Trinidadian or Guyanese. Was this an intentional double shift?  Nalo: Non-Caribbean readers don't  recognize the shifts in the dialogue from Jamaican to Trinidadian. Yes, the code-switching was quite deliberate. It gave me an opportunity to play with a couple of different  vernaculars. I play with it in the next novel,  Midnight Robber. I wondered what might  happen to English Caribbean vernaculars  if they were to develop as a language in  their own right.  Nadine: Octavia Butler's works speak to  me as a Black woman, not as fantasy, but as  prediction and survival for us as a people and  connected to the entire human race. I remember when her novel "Dawn" first came out  with a white woman on the cover. I am interested in the marketing of speculative fiction  by Diasporic writers.  Nalo: Nowadays the Black characters  in Octavia Butler's novels are lovingly depicted on their covers. She and I share a  publisher, Warner Aspect Books and its editor-in-chief, Betsy Mitchell, is pretty  clueful.  There aren't a lot of Black novelists in  science fiction and fantasy (I consider myself more a fantasy writer). I only know of  three other published Caribbean writers in  the field. It's a genre where readers like to  be challenged with worlds and  worldviews they may find unfamiliar.  What I've enjoyed is the way that my  work has pulled other Black and Caribbean writers out of the woodwork. Often  they're saying that they've been fearing  that their work would never get an audience, that they've been told that Black people don't write that stuff. But a Black  woman wrote "Beloved" which could just  as well sit on the fantasy shelves as in the  'Black' section. It's nice to have company.  Nadine: Thinking of the women characters that live within the spiritual/limbo world  of the Caribbean (Ole Higue, Marni Wata, La  jablesse, and Nanny) most of these female  characters pose elements of danger to humans.  Have you incorporated some of these characters into Midnight Robber?  Nalo: Caribbean folk tales are like any  original folk tales—they're scary. They  warn that the world is a dangerous place.  I like using folkloric material because those  old tales have such powerful truths embedded in them.  The society I've created—its folklore  is reflected in its technology. Nanny in my  novel is a type of technology that reflects  the original Nanny's care for her people.  But the folk tale character who has a place  of honour in the story is the Midnight Robber. That character, from Trinidad Carni-  Mixed blessings  ■   by Mala  Janisse Browning is a mother, a teacher and an oral historian who constantly draws from and gives back  to the river of her mixed ancestry. Currently, she is writing about the alliances between people of African  descent and Aboriginal peoples—concentrating on links found in Southern Ontario where her people are  rooted. She likes to write (at this time) in poetry "that is open ended and takes you to different places and does  not tell you the way things are or have to be."  Her goal is to help the bridging of those two cultures with a collection of poems called Black and Red  through a grant from the First People's Literature Oral and Spoken section of the Canada Council Grant. "I am  thankful to Marie Anne Harte Baker who told me about an internet site out of Minnesota or Minneapolis called  Red and Black which is a space for artists of this mixed ancestry working together." She is also doing this  work for her daughter Symone.  val, makes his fortune through banditry. In  contemporary times it's a male character,  but I have a woman take on the persona in  my novel.  Nadine: I read that Tan Tan has to deal  with being sexualized by her father. What other  issues for women does Midnight Robber address?  Nalo: Childhood sexual abuse is a  man's issue too, don't forget. I deal a bit  with childhood and the kind of powerlessness that can impose when you're dependent on adults, but the[y] have their own  frailties. I deal with motherhood and how  it affects the action. Funny, I dealt with that  in BGITR, too. I guess I must have been  thinking about it a lot for someone who isn't  a parent.  One of the well-worn plots is the hero  who goes and saves the world; in BGITR  my hero was breastfeeding. It made saving the world a little complex, and made  the stakes even higher.  Nadine: When is it out? Tours?  Nalo: The official release date for Midnight Robber is March 1. It ships to stores in  February. I'll be reading at the Toronto Public Libraries in February and April, call  (416) 393-7000 for details.  My publisher is sending me on a mini  U.S. tour, between February 27 and March  1.1 will also be at the conference of the Association of Caribbean Women Writers and  Scholars in Puerto Rico. I attend a number  of science fiction conventions, one of particular interest is Wiscon, a feminist science  fiction convention that's been running for  over 20 years in Wisconsin. All that information should be up on my website  soonishhttp: / 7www.sff.net/people/nalo  Nadine: Any independent bookstores you  want to big up for their support?  Nalo: As to thanking bookstores, the  danger is always that I'll forget a few. In  Toronto it's The Toronto Women's Bookstore, Bakka Books and A Different Booklist.  There's Nebula Books in Montreal, too.  Nalo Hopkinson was born in 1960. Her first  novel draft entered into a competition won the  attention of Warner Aspect Publishers and became the award winning book Brown Girl in  the Ring. Nalo lives in Toronto.  Janisse and her daughter Symone  FEBRUARY 2000 Images in Arts  New Film: It's a Hair Thing  by Michelle LaFlamme as told to  Kathy March   Kathy March: Why did you choose to  do this documentary about Black people's  hair?  Michelle LaFlamme: Originally I had  insights into how the activity in a hairshop  would be a brilliant play and I talked to  the owner of this particular hairshop called  Ebony Eyes.  She said, "No, no, no, you can't make  it into a play because it's natural and spontaneous."  Then I presented the idea of making it  into a documentary, and she replied that  she didn't want a camera and lights in the  shop. Then I read an article in Essence  Magazine about Ebony Eyes and it was circulating around the shop and they were  proud of it. So I said, "This is something  that is happening that needs to be captured." Then they opened up to the idea.  I wrote the proposal and went to the  NFB, actually I went in there with eight  proposals; the proposal for It's A Hair Thing  was small and manageable and it was chosen.  Kathy: Michelle, how large was your  production crew?  Michelle: I worked with a small crew  of three. Nicola Marin did the lighting,  Vlcklyn Fleming conducted the interviews,  and I operated the camera, driver and craft-  services.  Kathy: Your crew members were  women of colour?  Michelle: Yes, absolutely it was important to us as Black women. It was also important that the crew was familiar and comfortable with the spaces we were going into.  I also thought it important to interview  ourselves. The people behind the scenes  have a lot of control over what they represent. Within the hair shops, the people being interviewed became connected to the  piece because they were revealing very  emotionally charged memories.  Kathy: When I watched It's A Hair  Thing, I took note that there is representation of men also. What were your thoughts  when it came to executing this project?  Michelle: I thought it was important  to get a variety of voices: men, women, gay,  straight, people from Africa, people from  the West Indies, people from Vancouver  that were born here and their sense of isolation in terms of community.  People born in Canada have a different sense of community than those born in  an Afro-centric home place. We as a crew  are made up of a mixed race Canadian, a  West Indian and another member being  from Canada but having connections to  EastAfrica.  Although there are similarities  amongst different Black communities, I  think that Canada has a distinctly different  method of finding and creating community  in this huge, vast landscape.  Kathy: Michelle, have you seen the  video "Diana's Hair Ego"? It's about a  Black woman hairdresser in the southern  United States that dispenses safe-sex education from her hairshop.  Michelle: No, but when I started my  research I was pointed in the direction of  similar productions [to It's Hair Thing] that  have been done in Canada; a lot of these  focused on hair and what are the different  things that can be done to black hair.  I wanted to look at the larger picture  of what you get from the hair shop. In the  sense of home, sense of space, place, community. I wanted to make sure that I had  the sense of "hair as metaphor" as my objective.  Kathy: I really appreciated that as I  watched this documentary, often the experience of Black hair is seen as a burden. It's  A Hair Thing really does have people speaking of the hairshop, as a place to meet, as a  place to catch up.  Michelle: There is so much stigma  about Black hair from within and outside  the community. I really wanted to make  sure that at the end of the piece, a section  called 'Parting Advice' was included.  I thought it was really important that  what went into that section was really positive. It was important to me that the messages that went through the piece were  Afro-centric.  Kathy: This is a National Film Board  (NFB) co-production, right?  Michelle: Actually, it is not a co-production as I retain the rights. The funding  came from the NFB through the Film-makers Assistance Program (FAP). The NFB will  be involved in national distribution of this  documentary. FAP is very small scale funding for post-production. We worked on a  ridiculously skinny budget. But they could  see I had the content and the vision to create the treatment for each of those projects.  Selwyn Jacobs (NFB producer) has been [a]  mentor for me.  Kathy: As a Black woman film-maker  are there other professional associations  that support you?  Michelle: Yes, for example the Black  Film and Video Network, located in Toronto and the Vancouver Film School  [where] I am an alumni member. [I am] also  connected with Women in ^ilm and Television and Video In, as a part-time board  member.  Kathy: When will It's A Hair Thing be  released?  Michelle: We will have a screening this  year for Black History Month. Often Black  History Month presents things that are not  immediate to this community (in Vancouver).  We can learn from the past, but we can  also learn from the present. I think it is important to show how people are collaborating, and creating images that reflect this  particular community.  Michelle LaFlamme is working on her PhD at  UBC. She formed her own production company  -On The Fly Productions (OFP). Her work has  been supported byVideo In, NFB and the Vancouver Film School.  Darkroom magic  by Donnette Zacca as told to Nadine  Chambers   Nadine Chambers: How did you  come to art and photography as a youngster?  Donnette Zacca: When I got to about  5th form, my interest was the photography  club. We had small cameras—it was like no  turning back! Photography was all I  needed. The darkroom, the magic of the  process. Using the camera was learning  how to document your day by day experiences. The artistic potential was coming out  in that stage of my life. Then I went to the  School of Art. I got exposed to graphic art  and so I continued, this was the chance I  was waiting for. I was able to get my first  35 mm camera and I was exposed now to  the to darkroom and printing and processing my own film. And I became successful  at it.  Nadine: What was the support system  in terms of going into art from high school?  Donnette: Leaving High School of  course parents start looking at you going  into medicine or wanting to do law. When  I went home and said I wanted to do Art -  it was a shock. Anyway, I was able to convince [my father] that was the strongest area  in life. My mother died when I was very  young so I depended on my father alot for  support and he did that.  I went to Art school and I made sure  that I did well, because I also wanted to  prove to them that one could make a career out of Art. It never meant that you  would spend too much time smoking  gar\)a(laughter). My strongest area of  graphic arts was fine art photography. So I  have been having creating art-cards, exhibitions, entering competitions, magazine,  weddings... All the areas that people in  America and Canada would consider specialist areas-1 did all of it here.  Nadine: Talk to me about travelling  through Jamaica documenting the day to  day.  Donnette: There is this love for nature,  love for anything old, history... I started  documenting old houses, bridges, anything  that could carry on a story. Then I went into  Jamaica photographing the light houses  and the seascape around them. I went into  deep rural areas of Jamaica and documented stuff. When I went back to teach at  the school I got into portraiture. I would  take the faces and superimpose nature and  try to say that nature is a part of us.That is  where I am today.  Nadine: How have you found you've  grown technically- beyond point and click?  Donnette: You are always learning  something, everyday you are forced to explore something new. I am still trying to  find my best means of expressing what I  feel. There is the non-silver type photography, there are areas like those I still want to  explore.  Nadine: Any other women photographers?  Donnette: I know of Maria LaYacona,  she is a portrait photographer who's done  a lot of work for Jamaica in terms of important people, she has photographed a lot  to do with our culture—like Outdoor baptism. There is a new girl on the scene—her  name is Juliette Robinson, she was taught  by me but she is making her own statement.  There are not a lot of female photographers.  Nadine: Is it expensive in terms of access to darkroom, filmstock...  Donnette: The Art room at the School  of Art at the Edna Manley school is the largest on the island for black & white photography. It is expensive and a lot of the material comes from abroad.  Nadine: How is it for you as an artist  making it in the larger society?  Donnette: I started out very small with  my single prints for the newspapers, then I  went into entering competitions. From that  I got jobs, people in Drama, in the Music  fraternity, documentation of art... and then  I realized I was very good at making my  own images fine, B&W prints, on cards. I  had my own shows and they sold. I do a  lot of shoots for portfolios—I am popular  in that area. So I have been making my way  around Jamaica, I have seen and done alot  with the 35 mm camera. I am thinking  about working with larger cameras. I am  at the stage that I have a number of images  I want to present internationally which are  unique to Jamaica.  Nadine: So where are you heading to  next?  Donnette: I am working on that for the  year 2000. To come up with all the images  in the first 4 months so when I get back to  the States in May I'd like to have publishers to work with.

Bisi stresses the ongoing need for making  community allies  in the struggle for women's liberation. Last  but not least it completes this Black History month issue with  wisdom from the Grandmothers.  by Bisi Adeleye-Fayemi  Women  Europe  from the African tents meet in the N.American/  tents  Myself as an activist and the women  who spoke before me have said, be it religious fundamentalism, homophobia or any  kind of fundamentalism, we need to be able  to make connections. In organizing around  the rise of conservatism, we need to look at  the issue of making connections and never  lose sight of them.  When we were preparing for Beijing,  someone described the international movement as one of the most powerful social  movements in the world, and I said yes, it  is a powerful  movement and  that is why we  have conservatism  coming together.  Why? Because they  are afraid of what  we can do collectively [applause].  <E^ So please  "55 when we go back,  •5 let us try to start  <*^ addressing these  >> structures [of can't servatism]. While  g we are doing that,  o I would like to re's^ mind us of something Audre Lorde  once said (may her  soul rest in peace);  "The master's tools will never dismantle the  master's house." [applause] They will only  allow you to beat him at his game tem-po-  ra-ri-ly So before you go to work within  the structures that are a part of the master's  house, built with the master's tools, let us  think how we can manufacture our own  tools.  I'd also like to specifically address  strategies that Akina Wa Africa uses to work  with women in the UK.

AMWA offered support, welfare,  advice, where to go for health and social  benefits, helped workers get childcare, provided translation services, counselling,  and so on. We did that for a few years until we realized we were deep in the master's house using the master's tools. So we  said we need to change our strategies. We  need to start telling the masters to reconstruct this house because the roof is leaking, the carpets are damp and the bed is  wet.  We started to organize differently. We  started asking questions; we started doing  advocacy work, lobbying work; it was interesting to find ourselves in meetings  where often we were the only Black  women and everytime they looked at us,  their body language was telling us, "  Where did they learn to say that?" [laughter]  Those of us who are non-refugee or  migrant worker type of job seekers need  to know what is being done to these groups  of marginalized women. These women are  now organizing autonomously for themselves, but we should all take responsibility for ensuring their issues are put on the  table alongside our issues.  We also need to look into the issue of  strategic networking and alliance using.  Networking sounds like a cliche. Everybody networks; that's how we got here. But  there's networking and then there's networking. I want to emphasise the word "  working". We network to work. When you  go back, I'd like to see a situation where  we have used alliances we have never  thought of using before to counterbalance  all the alliances which are lined up against  us.  Before I end, I bring you a message  from my grandmother. Two years ago  when [Secretary General of the UN 4th  World Conference on Women] Gertrude  Mongella was telling people about the  Editor's Top Picks  world conference she said, "We need to  organize in such a way so women everywhere know what is going to happen in  Beijing." She said even her mother in the  village needs to know. She said if someone  like her mother doesn't know then it would  be failure on her part.  I sent a message to my grandmother a  few months ago. She is non-literate, not illiterate but non-literate. She has never even  heard of China, but I wrote to her about  what we were going to do in China. She  wrote me a letter through someone in our  language and I had it translated because I  would like to share it with you.  She writes, "I wish you well in this  place you are going. There is nothing that  is impossible. What was impossible for us  is now possible for you. I am happy that in  my lifetime something will be done about  the situation of women. Remember, there  is nothing that is hard that doesn't eventually become soft." [laughter, applause]  The next part is, " There is nothing inside a man's trousers that is more important than what is inside a woman's head."  [applause, laughter]  "May the spirits of our ancestors guide  you. May you go well and come back well."  [applause]  My vision... is of a world where women's lives are considered as important as  men's, a world where women can make informed choices and not false ones. A world  where women and men everywhere can  manufacture new tools to build a better  world, not for masters but for all  humanityfopp/flusej  Bisi Adeleye-Fayemi is a key member of Akina  Mama Wa Afrika UK based NGO organization for African women.
