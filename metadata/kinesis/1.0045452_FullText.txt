If I am able to control my rage for the  next half hour, I would like to tell  you a story.  It is a true one.  It  has to be true; no one could begin to  make-up such a tale.  It is just too  incredible.  This episode has all the  proportions of the proposed Orwellian  nightmares. Only we, as a society,  have achieved the feared goal ten  years before the projected 1984.  I  guess Orwell did not give the capitalists enough credit in their fervor.  Things are not exactly as he predicted:  there is the rewriting of history,  room 101 has become the conference  room of the Regional Department of  Labour with the investigator adjusting  the MUSAK to a senselessly loud tone,  and there are X number of flunkies who  are falling over each other to take  the role as members of the Anti-sex  League.  But the surprising aspect is  the government is supporting, rather  than destroying, the super-capitalists.  Of course, the question can be posed  as to when a monolithic company ceases  to be part of the free enterprise system and starts to become a dictator,  not only to its employees, but to its  controlling agency as well.  But I  digress.  In February 1973, I filed a complaint  with the Federal Government under the  Canada Labour Code stating that I was  being discriminated against because I  was a woman. The complaint was questioning hiring, training, wages and  promotional practices of management  staff of B.C. Telephone Company, and  in particular the staff of their data  processing area where I was a computer  programmer.  Early in March I met with  the Regional Chief of Labour Standards  and he appointed an investigator. The  rules of investigation were explained  to me.  Basically these were:  1) I would present an argument and  back it with documents (or request  the government to get these documents if I was unable, for reasons  of their being company property),  2) the government would then go  to the company to refute these  argument^,  3) I was to ha?e the final- say on  the company's defense.  The investigation began in earnest  with a date for the final report set  for May 1973.  In the beginning the  investigator attempted to discourage  me from complaining.  Initially this  was on the basis that I was making  "nearly $ 1000 a month" which he  thought were "pretty good wages."  What never seemed to matter was that  there were persons with less responsibility, seniority, whatever that  were making- more and they were men.  He further discouraged by his directly  telling me I was not allowed to bring  witnesses to any of the interviews.  To counter this I merely showed up on  meeting day with a witness and he did  not refuse to see us. This decision  of witnesses is a necessary part of  anyone filing a complaint. Never go  to any interviews alone, however trivial they may seem.  In April there was to be a grand  exchange of information between the  company and myself with the government acting as liaison. For this  occasion, the Chief of Labour Standards and his deputy came from Ottawa.  The evidence I saw was based on the  three person payroll team I was part  of. Much of it was inaccurate and I  was asked to make corrections to it  based on the position I held at BC  TEL.  In spite of the inaccuracies,  the largest error on the part of the  company was omitting much of the work  I had done in the past.  I made my  corrections (which were then to go  back to the company for further discussion) and then I was shown a letter  that my boss had written for my case.  In this letter the company had chosen  someone to compare me to and had given  the government a written statement on  why this man (a partner of mine on  the payroll team) was receiving greater  salary than I. Whereas I did not  agree with the statement presented, I  was pleased to have something concrete  to build a case on. And, as the  government presented its views that  day, they suggested that all I had to  do was to get a witness to agree that  I'indeed did have greater responsibility than the chosen comparison.  I  knew from private conversations that  this "comparison co-worker" did agree  with me, but I had no assurance that  he would still agree with me if he  testified.  But, since it appeared  that my case was so close to being  proven, I requested that he be interviewed, along with the other member  of the payroll team.  In May, under my urging, the government investigator interviewed the two  men on the payroll programming team.  There was a great hassle as to where  these men were to be interviewed.  The company had arranged, with the  blessing of the government, to have  the interviews take place in my boss's  office at the place where we worked.  Neither of the persons who were to be  interviewed wanted to answer questions  on company property.  I requested a  neutral place be designated for the  questioning. Finally after much  harranguing and after both men called  the Department of Labour and requested that the place of interview be  changed, the government yielded to  pressure. However, in later instances  the government refused to listen to  requests that interviews be held in  a neutral place and interviewed  people in-, what I considered to be,  a hostile environment:  in company  offices and conference rooms and  sometimes in the public lobbies of  BC TEL office buildings.  But to return to the interviews.  One of the men interviewed, the company chosen comparison, testified in  my behalf. That is he substantiated  my case. The other man, I gathered,  was rather a neutral witness since  very little was ever said about his  testimony.  After the interview of  the payroll team members, an ominous  silence spread over my case. In May (after the government interview),  the man who testified in my behalf was  given his annual review much ahead of  the scheduled time.  This review  stated that his work had been poor and  superseded the previous review that  had been above average.  In another  interview with the investigator around  this time, I was told that my case was  a "goddamn, pain in the neck." This  is hardly the statement one should  expect to hear from a neutral person  gathering information for a case such  as mine.  The investigator kept asking,  almost insisting, about "my work suffering" due to my involvement in the  case.  I could only gather from this  statement the investigator was.hoping,  if the case continued over a long  enough period, that I would drop it  due to the energy necessary to keep  going, and that the company was suggesting to him that I was doing poor  work.  Then, one afternoon in June,  the investigator called at 3:30 to tell  me "that in one-half hour, he would be  leaving town for five weeks and when  he returned, he would have the final  report written.  I would get one more  interview and the company would have  the final interview.  I questioned this  last statement since I was the one who  had the case to prove and had been  previously told that I would get the  final say on all evidence.  Also I was  angered the investigator had not chosen  to tell me of his impending absence  before this time, thereby making it  impossible for me to see him before  he left.  July and August rolled by and in  September two events occurred:  1)  the man who had been my "comparison"  was fired for poor work, 2) parts of  the "final" report were read to me.  To look at these more closely in  reverse order, parts of the report  were read to me and on the evidence  used the government could come to no  conclusion.  They decided that they  could not compare people within my  classification since we did not all do  exactly the same work.  In other words,  if you perform a professional or  managerial job, you will, under this  interpretation of the law, never be  able to lodge a complaint with the  government and have it stand up.  The other defeating factor of the  report was a great deal of the original evidence, shown to me in April,  was not used.  To return to the fellow who lost his  job.  The government tried to discourage him from complaining for  wrongful dismissal, since it was  "quite a serious, criminal charge."  And, also that the dismissal had no  connection with my case since the  company gave poor work and not his  testimony as reason for dismissal.  (How the company found out about  his testimony is another entire  story unto itself.  But, I have  suspected for the last year that  my private, home telephone has been  tapped.)  The government was unable  to answer the query that we posed  saying the company would be a  fool to suggest that they had fired  someone for testifying and thereby  set themselves up for prosecution.  The "comparison" decided to complain  anyway since the Canada Labour Code  states that anyone who complains,  or testifies or is about to testify  cannot be threatened with dismissal  or be dismissed.  So the crux of the  matter is not whether this man did  poor work or not, only if he testified, which everyone agrees he did.  This man did file a complaint and  as it stands, the government can  make no decision on the evidence it  has.  But somewhere, the letter  written by my boss for my case back  in April, stating what a fine employee this person is, has disappeared, and is not being used as  part of the government's evidence.  My next move, in September and  October, through the Status of Women,  was to get friends of equal wages in  Ottawa to put some pressure on the  Labour Department.  The head of  Labour Standards came to Vancouver  in November to take a final look at  my case.  There was to have been new  evidence added, but this was not so.  This time the official decided that  persons in the job classification that  I belonged could be compared.  But,  the government said that if a difference in salary did exist that the company would best know what that salary  should be since they were hiring on  the market.  In essence, the company  always has final authority in salary  decisions and the government is not  one to question that, even if people  will testify to the contrary.  And there is where my case stands,  rather shakily on a wall of ever disappearing evidence.  Early in February  1974, I taped a show for the CBC  OMBUDSMAN series with Labour Minister,  John Munro, answering for his department.  On the air Munro said he would  look into a great many aspects of my  case, but in private he has defended  his investigator most vigorously with  little regard to the facts.  The  government seems more interested in  whether they have a good image rather  than in finding the truth. Munro  insists that I have had a fair hearing  from the evidence the investigator  has presented.  (Haven't I heard  that phrase somewhere before?) Perhaps the most incredible of his  statements is his claim of right  decision since the government spent  more time on my case than on any  other.  This brings three thoughts  to mind:  1) why hasn't the department spent more time on other cases,  2) why did they have to spend so  much extra time on my case when they  nearly had the 100% proof they require in April 1973, 3) quantity of  investigation does not necessarily  ensure quality.  I can answer the  first part of this query, simply no  one who has any integrity at all  wants to put up with the sort of  investigation that I have been forced  to watch.  Therefore few persons complain or get past the initial investigation roadblocks.  It is soul,  destroying to watch evidence appear  and disappear and for the government  investigators to change their minds  with no apparent reasons.  3o, if the capitalists and their  government get their way, I guess I  am doomed.  And, if I am doomed,  then the next person to complain  will go through the same experiences  of paranoia that I have had, as I  watch the government chose their  evidence and ease to the corporation' s defense.  This paranoia is a  very real aspect of dealing with  the system as it is.  As a warning  to anyone who might wish to file a  complaint, do not complain because  of the good it is going to do for  all the women of the world, complain  only for yourself and because you  have been wronged.  If you complain  for any other reason, you will not  be able to stand the pressure.  And, be prepared to lose your job,  since you will undoubtedly either  be fired or forced out as I was.  I resigned in November due to intolerable working conditions.  Unfortunately, that is the only  advice I can offer to anyone who  wants to attempt to bring a case  to justice.  That, and you will  discover a great deal about what  sort of person you are and those  that you have been dealing with.  You will make some close friends  but lose scores of other half-  friends, of both sexes.  The area  of civil rights needs no more  martyrs, go into a case in a very  legal, well-organized manner and  attempt to document every detail  that can play a part in your  defense if you can bear to allow  yourself to think about it.  About halfway through my case I  was debating one evening if the  hassle and agony I had been experiencing were worth it.  My decision  to continue was based on a quote  from Faulkner's Intruder in the  Dust:  Yes.  Some things you must  always be unable to bear.  Some  things you must never stop  refusing to bear.  Injustice  and outrage and dishonour and  shame.  No matter how young you  are or how old you have got.  Not for kudos and not for cash.  Your picture in the paper nor  money in the bank either.  Just  refuse to bear them.  Until that refusal Faulkner talks  about is accepted, I am afraid (and  that is my paranoia showing again)  Orwell was right.  women's kit  The Vancouver Status of Women office has The Women's Kit, a large  cardboard box full of pamphlets,  filmstrips, posters, slides, etc. on  all subjects concerned with the  women's movement (eg. history,  socialization, children's literature,  marriage).  The Kit was produced by  a group of women at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and  is on loan to us for an indefinite  period of time.  If you are a teacher  or are involved in groups dealing  with women's issues, this Kit will  be invaluable to you for discussions  or presentations.  If you wish to  view the Kit and/or borrow it,  please contact the office. resource bonk  The following list of women's  resources in the Vancouver  Area was compiled by Community Information Centre a  service of Vancouver Crisis  Centre. The resources ac-  comoanied by an asterisk are  those that I know to be feminist  and/or to provide quality service.  (These are m^; personal observations.) I ask women who have had  occasion to use any of these services, starred or unstarred, to  let us know by phone or mail how  you would evaluate them.  Many of  these resources may deserve recommendation, but are unfamiliar to us  since we have had no conatct with  them or with women who have made  use of them.  The list may seam long and  varied, but I remind you that  many of the organizations'Ã±â   that provide desperately  needed assistance to women  receive only short term or  sporadic financial aid.  Therefore, the women's resource picture is not as  bright as it looks on paper.  Support existing services by  telling your government representatives (federal, provincial,  and municipal) what you need  and what you endorse. Make  donations of time or money  whenever you are able.

Yours Cordially,  Lola Leach  National Association of Parliamentarians collage  Carol Gordon  Here's news of a valuable service  growing in our midst. Women's  Employment Boutique and the newly  funded LIP project Explorers '74  are working together at 1129 East  Hastings Street to reach women  that have been alienated by manpower.  The Boutique, which commenced last  summer as an Outreach Project  funded by the Special Programs  Branch of Canada Manpower, and the  Explorers are helping to find new  employment opportunities for female  ex-offenders, probationers, inmates  prior to release and undetected as  well as potential offenders.  They  are also slowly but surely chiseling  away at that area of jobs previously  considered 'male territory' and are  exposing employers who are discriminating against their clients as  women and/or as offenders.  Some of  the more non-traditional jobs they  have been able to fill for women  include:  tree planter, gas station  attendent, postwoman, drivers and  a radio production job.  The Boutique and The Explorers are  working very closely with corrections agencies, manpower and other  women's groups in order to help more  women become aware of the area of  employment services available to  them which will assist them in discovering their individual employment interests and potentials.  They boast proudly of a 697Â» placement rate.  The two women of the Women's  Boutique handle interviewing and  counselling and can be reached at  255-0616. The seven Explorers '74  women can be contacted at 253-4635  regarding employer recruitment and  on the job training.

Hope to see you at INTERNATIONAL  WOMEN'S DAY March 8th in the Coronation Room of the YWCA commencing  at 8 p.m.  gov't funds to discriminators  Rosemary Brown, MLA for Vancouver Burrard recently introduced into the legislature  a private members bill, the  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN ACT.  The act calls for an end to  sexual discrimination by institutions receiving provincial government monies, (every  B.C. institution, organization,  government department, Crown  Corporation, government Commission, Board and Agency,  person and company)  The bill  makes these institutions responsible for the enactment  of programs which lead to full  employment and education, including hiring, promotion,  superannuation, training and  retraining, and access to jobs.  If the Act comes into force  any recipient of government  monies who has not registered  an equalization plan within  ninety days will cease to receive provincial monies.  In  addition, any person affected  by the institution's failure  to implement the plan will be  able to take court action  against the employer.  As Glinda Sutherland points  out, the new Human Rights  Code can deal only with sex  discrimination after the fact.

Telephone:  736-3746  The Newsletter is published monthly by  the Vancouver Status of Women.  Its  objective is to provide an open channel  of communication between the members of  the organization and to promote understanding about the changing position of  women in society. -The Newsletter is  dedicated to a philosophy consistent  with the women's movement.  But because discrimination  upon the basis of sex is so  complex, involving the attitudes of employers, we desperately need legislation  that will put the onus upon  the government to equalize  opportunites in provincial.  employment.  If the government ignores  this piece of legislation  it is giving tacit approval to discrimination a-  gainst women.  Kathy Sopko  Publication Date:  The first week of  each month.

LOCAL  1   (UBC)  Like most working women, clerical and  library workers at UBC are underpaid  and often work under unnecessarily  bad conditions. Wages go as low as  $ 408 per month; many areas of the  campus have no facilities for staff  to eat lunch or rest; lighting,  ventilation, and noise of office  machines are problems in some areas;  many departments are understaffed;  library workers work shifts, often  without a reasonable rest between  shifts.  The Association of University and  College Employees (AUCE) was formed  by clerical and library workers who  decided collective action was the  only way to solve these problems.  A  look around at existing unions showed  that the differential in pay between  men and women was actually greater  among unionized workers at UBC than  among the non-unionized staff.  Since 907o of clerical and library  workers are women, the existing  unions did not seem likely to meet  their needs.  AUCE was formed as a  democratic and completely independent  union, in August of 1973.  Beginning in September, union members  at UBC spent lunch hours, coffee  breaks and days off running around  the thousand-acre campus handing out  That was almost three months ago.  In  spite of the NDP's promises to speed  up certification procedures, the  Labour Relations Board has yet to  grant official recognition to AUCE at  U.B.C.  With the high staff turnover  that results from low wages and poor  conditions, this has meant that the  union must keep up a continuous membership drive to maintain a majority.  It also makes it difficult to maintain  enthusiasm.  Union members have not been sitting  back waiting.  We are preparing for  negotiations so we'll be ready to  start immediately certification is  granted.  The Local is divided into  ten divisions with about 100 staff  members in each.  Each division has  been meeting to discuss contract  leaflets and signing up members.  We  were told, of course, that it couldn'1  be done.  After all, big unions with  professional high-paid organizers had  tried several times to unionize UBC  without success.  Perhaps well-paid  male union officials don't understand  the problems of secretaries and library workers.  In any case, UBC staff,  working volunteer, succeeded where  they had failed.  By December 14,  about 650 members had been signed up,  and the union applied for certification.  proposals, and each one has elected  a representative to the Contract  Committee which will negotiate with  the U.B.C. administration. As well,  we are setting up committees to  research areas like wages, benefits,  job classifications, etc.  The negotiating process may be even  more difficult and time-consuming  than the original membership drive.  But there are lots of people involved  already, and we are convinced we can  do this, too, better than high-paid  professional negotiators could.  The negotiations concern our wages,  our working conditions, our job  classifications.  We are the experts  on those areas.  When the trade union movement began,  it consisted of groups of working  people getting together to solve  their own problems at work.  This is  the kind of union AUCE is trying to  build.  Already, people outside of  UBC are agreeing.  Local #2 of AUCE  was recently chartered at Simon  Fraser University.  We hope this will  set an example for other unorganized  clerical and service workers, that  we' can and must organize ourselves.  A.U.C.E.  Phone -  Box 11,  224-5613  - Jean Rause  SUB, U.B.C.  male unions and female members  A recent complaint of a woman  belonging to the Construction  and General Labourers Union,  Local 602, has been brought to  the attention of VSW.  The  complainant has experience as  a flagger outside the lower  mainland.  But, when speaking  to the Vancouver dispatcher  about putting her name on the  eligibility list for similar  employment, he refused to do  so on the grounds that "she  was a woman".  He qualified  his statement saying it was  not a personal policy but an  action taken since no one  would hire her.  When the complainant sought to lay a complaint , the business agent  insisted he did not have the  time to listen to her problem  and hung up.  The complainant has found a  part-time job as a flagger on  her own.  But, another request  to the dispatcher to have her  name put on the eligibility  list was refused.  This time  on the grounds that her presence would antagonize employers who would then look elsewhere for workers, thereby  jeopardizing the chances of  men in the union.  He further  expressed his displeasure  over companies who were hiring  women as flaggers, since this  is a position previously  "saved for older men".*  Thus evolves the questionable  situation of a union catering  to an employers discriminatory  policy when its basic duty is  to protect the employee from  such practices. Another a-  palling aspect of the situation is that our complainant  is a member in good standing  of the Construction and Labourers Union and even paid  dues while unemployed.  She is  in the ridiculous situation of  not receiving any support from  the very union she finances.  Is it not a dishonest practice  for a union to take money from  members who they have no interest in or intention of helping? VSW is seeking an answer.  kelowna  A Public Health Educator who on two  occasions stated publicly to the  media that "....women's lib is a  cause of V.D." will not be making  such statements in future.  In response to a letter sent by the K.S.W.,  Dennis Cocke replied that this certainly wasn't the policy of his  department, extended his apologies,  and assured us that supervisory personnel had been in touch with the  South Okanagan Health Unit and no  more statements of this sort would be  forthcoming.  (A great letter, by the  way, and a copy of which was sent to  the South OK Health Unit)  The Kelowna Status of Women is  sponsoring through the Adult Educa  tion Department a six week course on  "Women and the Law" beginning Feb. 7.  Following a letter to the Bank of  Montreal condemning them for sex- -  typing employment opportunity advertisements in the local daily newspaper (and carbon copies to all the  local banks, Kathleen Ruff, Monroe,  King, and the Kelowna Daily Courier)  Senior Personnel from the Bank  phoned the writer, apologized and  stated that'this would not happen  again.  Curiously, the Kelowna Daily  Courier dropped all sex-typing in  their help wanted advertisements the  very next day.  (All ads now appear  under "Help Wanted"....period.  In December the Kelowna Status of  Women raffled off a side of beef  (compliments of a member who owns a  butcher shop) and made approximately  $ 300.

One C-R group is in <  progress and (hopefully) another  pending. people's   law   school   update  The Vancouver People's Law School has  been operating since May of 1972 giving free law classes in the Vancouver  area.  With each course offered, we  have provided students with a summary  of the law in that particular area,  in booklet form.  Because of the great  demand for these booklets we have begun to revise them, (a) to be printed  on newsprint, (b) to include photographs and illustrations, and (c) to  include a bibliography and footnotes.  Our first booklet to be revised is  Women and the Law, which is now available for the cost of printing, 50c.  This booklet is 32 pages long and  includes the following topics:  Marriage, Common-Law Marriage, Child  Care, Welfare, Labour, Crime.  During the spring, we will be revising  and publishing the following booklets:  Canadian Court System, Civil Liberties  Consumer Protection, Criminal Procedures, Divorce and Matrimonial Property, Family Court Procedures,  Immigration, Labour Law, Land Transactions, Legal Research, Mental  Patients & the Law, Pollution &  Environmental Law, Sentencing, Small  Debts Court Procedures, Traffic  Court Procedures  With the support of the Provincial  Education Media Centre we have produced Video tape recordings of three  of our courses: Women and the Law,  Consumer Protection, and Youth and  the Law.  These are scheduled to be  broadcast in the Vancouver region at  the end of April or May on Channel 10  Cablevision.  The courses are also  available to high schools in B.C.  through the Education Department Audio  Visual Services Catalogue. In the  near future, we will establish our  own lending library of these tapes  and further courses, using % inch  video tapes for interested groups to  borrow, or to buy for the cost of the  video tape only.  We are very concerned to make contact with groups involved in similar  activities and would appreciate  receiving information on your activities.

Winners in the various categories  were:  * Advertising:  The Hudson's Bay  Company, J.D. Peterson, customer services manager, for "production of a  Christmas '73 advertising campaign  depicting women as shrews who are  softened only by Bay gifts or credit  cards."  * Government:  James Richardson,  defence minister.. "The Bay Street  Armory in Victoria offered 60 summer  militia jobs to high school students.  Jobs involved training, but only .10  were open to females."  * Special Events:  Cy Ashdown, vice-  chairman, the B.C. Juvenile Soccer  Association.  Girls in Power River,  who for years had played on soccer  teams with boys, were dismissed from  their teams and now are seeking a  Supreme Court writ.  Ashdown is  quoted as saying:  "If they are  successful, I will shut down the  whole league."  * The courts:  The Supreme Court of  Canada, for two decisions.  One involved the decision that if a status  Indian woman marries a non-Indian she  loses her Indian status.  The other  decision was that a farmer's wife,  divorcing her husband, was not entitled to a share of the farm to  which she had contributed her labour.  * Labour and equal opportunity:  Bud Drury, treasury board chairman,  for permitting the continuing situation in which women hold only 0.01%  of top civil service jobs.  * The media: Trevor Lautens of the  Vancouver Sun, for a column dated  July 16, 1973. The award was made to  "leggy, blond and full-figured Trevor  Lautens."  * Finally, the Grand Boar Award went  to Claude Prefontaine, spokesman for  the Canadian Airline Flight Attendants  association, for a recent vote in  which the predominantly male association board voted out an equal-  opportunity clause in Air Canada's  new contract with the Association.  Prefontaine was quoted as saying:  "I object to waiting for years until  all those chicks who have been stewardesses for a long time become  pursers.  I don't want to work under  a woman, they are too emotional.  Having a woman in charge does not  look good from the passengers' point  of view."  All awards were made in absentia, but  will be mailed to the recipients.  (Feb.   20/74)  Gov't.  Medi  Business  Token Women all photos by carol gordon  villager shoes  idiocy  in  adland  contessa select  The place is the VILLAGER SHOE STORE,  542 Granville St., Vancouver.  The  year is 1974.  The window display is  not only sexist, it is obscene.  The regional manager tells us he sees  nothing offensive in the pictures. We  patiently try to educate him to the  meaning and harmful effects of sexist  advertising.  He tells us that the  torso in the pictures could belong to  either sex.  I think to myself that  he needs a course in anatomy, or perhaps the eunuch figure in the "Love  is...." cartoon is getting to him.  We tell him he must be putting us on,  that he can't be serious.  He is. We  remind him that many women will be  insulted by this display and will not  buy his shoes.  He says that the ones ,  who work in the store like it and the  few who don't are probably cranks.  He tells us that he would like to  break the necks of those people who  defiled his store window with "sexism" stickers.  (We didn't do it).  Yet he doesn't see that women are  also being defiled by such pictures,  and that the damage is much greater.  We remind him that he had invited us,  over the phone, to visit his store to  give our opinion of the display, and  that he would respect our judgement.  He refuses to remove the pictures.  They are still there as of February  28th. What more can we do? Maybe  if enough women and men object, the  Villager Shoe Store will get the  message, even if it's written only  in dollar signs.  P.S.  We have just received a phone  call from another more senior Villager manager, who informed us that he  agreed with our objections and will  remove the display immediately from  the store window.  He also offered  his apologies for having offended  women by these pictures, which he  said was done inadvertently.  So,  perhaps there is a glimmer of hope  on the advertising horizon after all.  - S. Purdy  RE: MANMADE DISPLAY  We were deeply angered by  your men's shoe dept. poster depictin a woman's  face superimposed on the  crotch of a headless female body titled as above.  The blatant sexist message  that women are the product  of men and that men who  wear your shoes will 'Bake'  women and that women's  brains are in their pubic  area, is o  area, is offensive.  This  was adolescent and insidiously vicious.  The reverse equivalent of  this image namely a man's  face in a man's crotch  headed 'womanmade' reveals  how horrendously silly,  even puerile this theme  really is.  Psychologists  have shown such attitudes  to be damaging to the relationship between the  sexes.  Thankfully this propaganda  was recently removed from  your premises. We would  appreciate a reply, dependant upon which our 14oo  affiliated members may  decide to boycott your  products.  Mr. Torresan  Advert. Dept.  MacDonald's Tobacco Marketing  801 -1550 Alberni St.  Vancouver  Sir:  Your recent "Contessa Slim"  campaign impressed us *<=  conspicuously gauche and  ridiculous.  We object to this project por  traying women as narcissists  who need to smoke pretty cigarettes to capture prince charming.  The very name of your  product reinforces the rigid  beauty standard to which men  are not subjected and a false  standard of prestige, in terms  of independence, merely a trinket.  In contrast, the cigarette  package appears to be directed  to the 'new woman', whoever t  that is, with its contemporary simplicity in design and  color.  But all women are not  alike contrary to the stereotype.  Therefore there can be  no such thing as a woman's  cigarette'.  It is a preten- .  tious fraud. We surmise it  is only the package that is  different, not the contents.  And if the ingredients are  different from traditional  ciagrettes, on what basis did  you mix your blend to women's  tastes?  This campaign was foolish and  alienating. We suggest you  consult with varioiu  consult with various women's  groups in future if you want  to construct a valid and relevant advertisement.  In the  meantime, .depending on your  reply, our.1400 affiliated  members will not be smoking  your product.  MEDIA ACTION GROUP WRITES  When ad agents decide to push the old  "woman as body to sell the product"  image, the SWC Feminist Fighting  Forces come out of the woodwork, especially when the promotional stunt  happens to be a splashy champagne and  shrimp party at the Hyatt Regency.  Contessa Select cigarettes (alias  Macdonald Tobacco Co.) were hosting  the event for the press in the hopes  that the message would get around  that "the well-dressed woman smokes  Contessa cigarettes".  To this end  the indulgent crowd was first presented  with a Montreal fashion designer and  her creations, the overt message  being that Contessa is doing their  bit to promote Canadiana.  (Hey,  wasn't Macdonald Tobacco recently  sold to an American company?) What  the press was supposed to be hanging  out their tongues for, however, was  the highlight of the shqw, when the  chosen few among the press would be  invited to dress some scantily clad  models in "fashion" creations using  uncut materials.  So four men did it,  admirably withstanding the sexist  remarks flung at them by the MC, comments like "I'll bet you're more used  to undressing women than dressing  them" and "Doesn't this tickle your  fancy?" But the jokes didn't come  off too well, the men on stage looked  awkward and the guests were only  vaguely amused.  And Jack Wasserman  and James Barber, both of whom had  refused the dubious honour of taking  part in a promotional stunt that uses  women's bodies, wrote nasty things in  their newspaper columns about the  Contessa Select party.  As for us,  the SWC professional infiltrators,  we snapped pictures, made our objections known to the right people, and  took the occasional sip of champagne.  - S. Purdy A) Inexpensive Paperback Anthologies:  Psyche: The Feminine Poetic Consciousness, edited by Barbara  Segnitz and Carol Rainey (Dell:  New York, 1973).  Twenty North American women poets  are represented in this collection.  Among them are Margaret Atwood,  Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Adrienne  Rich, Diane Wakoski, Nikki Giovanni,  Denise Levertov, Marianne Moore,  Gwendolyn Brooks.  The introductory  essay discusses the major themes in  the poetry of the women represented  in the anthology.  Also included  are short biographical notes on the  poets.  Rising Tides: 20th Century American  Women Poets, edited by Laura Chester  and Sharon Barba, with a very brief  introduction by Anais Nin. (Pocket  Books: New York, 1973).  The editors selected 70 women poetsâ  which is at least some 40 poets too  many for an anthology this size.  As  a result, many poets are represented  by only one or two of their poems,  which is far from enough to give the  reader a fair idea of what a poet's  work is really like.

B) Other Somewhat More Expensive Books  Images of Women in Literature, an  anthology edited by Mary Anne Ferguson  (Houghton Mifflin: Boston, 1973).  This anthology presents a selection  of short stories arranged around the  images of the submissive wife, the  mother, the dominating wife, the  seductress-goddess, the sex object,  the liberated woman.  Images of Women in Fiction: Feminist  Perspectives, edited by Susan Koppel-  man Cornillon (Popular Press:  Bowling Green, 1972).  This book offers a collection of  feminist literary criticism, grouped  in four categories, the woman as  heroine (traditional views), the  invisible woman (the woman as "other")  the woman as hero (women as whole  people), and feminist aesthetics.  Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School,  by Barbara Grizzuttis Harrison  (Liberight: New York, 1973).  An account of a two-year effort to  change sexist attitudes, beliefs,  and practices, in and out of the  curriculum, at a private, multiracial elementary school in Brooklyn,  New York.  - compiled by  E.F. Giacomelli  SUSAN SONTAG on  The Already Liberated Woman  "Not so paradoxically, the position of a 'liberated' woman in a  liberal society where the vast  majority of women are not liberated can be embarrassingly easy.  Granted a good dose of talent and a  certain cheerful or merely dogged  lack of self-consciousness, one can  even escape (as I did) the initial  obstacles and derision that are  likely to afflict a woman who insists on autonomy.   ...Her good  fortune is like the good fortune of  a few blacks in a liberal but stiLl  racist society.  Each liberal grouping (whether political, professional,  or artistic) needs its token woman.  Any already 'liberated* woman who  complacently accepts her privileged  situation participates in the oppression of other women.  I accuse  the overwhelming majority of women  with careers in the arts and  sciences, in the liberal professions, and in politics of doing just  that."  SUSAN SONTAG, "The Third World of  Women," in The Partisan Review,  no. 2, 1973. (E.F.G.)  BETTY FRIEDAN ten years after  The Feminine Mystique:  "Each of us thought she was a freak  ten years ago if she didn't experience  that mysterious orgastic fulfillment  waxing the kitchen floor as the commercials promised."  "Society had to be restructured so  that women, who happen to be the  people who give birth, could make a  human, responsible choice whether or  not and when to have children,  and not to be barred thereby from  participating in society in their own  right."  "It seemed to me that men weren't  really the enemy they were fellow  victims, suffering from an outmoded  mystique which made them feel unnecessarily inadequate when there were  no bears to kill."  Betty Friedan, "Up from the Kitchen  Floor," in The New York Times Sunday  Magazine, March 4, 1973. (E.F.G.)  buried   alive  Oh, I know that there's a way  Everybody came to me one time and said  Honey, you can do anything...  And, I think I can.  But, what ugly good can it ever bring  Cause I can't find you with my love...  The year is 1969; the song, "To Love  Somebody"; the voice, Janis Joplin.  The expression is one recurring often  in Joplin1s work which emerges into  two themes: I know I can succeed but,  what use is success without a man to  share it. More than a commentary on  her work, this is Joplin's statement  of the 1960's.  It could be the statement of any woman at last recognizing  she can do, but constrained by what  she was reared to believe was society's  role for her.  More, or at least more  visibly than other entertainers,â¢  Joplin demonstrated this duality of  existence for women by her life and  even more dramatically by her early  death.  Buried Alive, a biography of Janis  Joplin, by Myra Friedman explores  the dichotomy of a confused woman's  worlds, life, actions. Friedman  sorts out the trials of being an  intelligent and'sensitive girl grow  ing into a man's society, only to get  there and discover that women have  begun to come into their own.  The  author discovers Joplin's inability  to create a stable relationship with  men, particularly the man she was  brought up to expect.  And, this  failure causes Joplin to magnify her  feelings into an inability to succeed  in anv facets of life.  It is the  tale of a person who has been so  assured of failure in life, that she  cannot accept the success she achieves.  This failure to bridge the gap between  the expected and the real, sentences  Joplin's life to destruction.  Buried Alive is about being unable  to break away from one's past because  you have broken away too far.  You  are too distant to trace your beginnings and remember the value for all  elements of life.  It is a powerful  book, as close a statement for life  in the 1960 - 1970 decade that we are  likely to find.  The book is fright-  eningly real as through Joplin1s life  it covers all our success and failures  as women and as human beings.  And,  like all real books the ending is not  entirely beautiful, not does it  resolve any of the conflict. ironing board?  As if it weren't bad enough to see  sex-role stereotyping and sexism rampant through the pages of children's  books and school readers, the experience of perusing pictures, posters,  film and other visual materials used  in elementary school classrooms is  enough to give the most tolerant feminist the shakes.  The VSW education staff recently had  the experience of actually going into  elementary school classrooms for the  purpose of recording the amount and  kinds of sex-role stereo-typing showing up in visual materials seen by  the pupils.  Officially we were carrying out a pilot project funded by  the Educational Research Institute  of B.C. to "study visual materials  on sex-role development in British  Columbia elementary schools".  The  study took us into various schools  in the lower mainland, where we  looked at any visual materials we  could find, not only to record sex-  stereotyping but as well to note any  examples showing non-traditional sex  roles or an absence of sex-role  stereo-typing where its presence would  be the norm.  We examined dozens of pictures,  posters, card sets, games and pictures in books.  Using the card  sets, which depicted various activities performed by people, we were  able to determine roughly the number  of times boys are present in pictures versus girls. We found that  children are seeing at least three  times as many boys in pictures as  girls and often as many as ten times  as many boys as girls.  One set had  no girls at all while other sets had  ratios of 21 boys to 3.girls, or 63  boys to 12 girls.  There was little or no awareness in  the materials we examined, both old  and new, of the changing role of  women and men in our society.  Pictures of sports, teams, clubs,  strength, exploring, science, and  building things Invariably showed  boys while girls were pictured associated with clothes, playing alone,  domestic duties, and dolls.  Only men  were shown in diversified occupations,  as coaches and community leaders,  and in scenes of history and war,  while women were associated with  mother, domestic duties, limited occupations, fashions and beauty.  Girls and women were most invisible  when it came to pictures of sports.  Cards showed only boys playing sports,  even individual sports such as skiing  and swimming.  One school library had  on its wall a sports display composed  of books and pictures. 'Not one of  these showed females or talked about  well-known women sports figures.  It's no wonder most girls in our  society grow up ignoring or hating  sports.  The crucial problem, as the above  information points up, is that girls  in school are not being given a wide,  and this being 1974, a realistic  range of role models to think about  and emulate.  When are publishers of  materials going to come to grips with  the facts of life, that not all women  wear aprons, that not all doctors are  men, that not only boys go camping,  and so on, ad nauseam.  Our report concluded that the time  was not for extensive study on the  problems of sex-role stereotyping;  we know that it touches to one degree  or another all aspects of society and  is perpetuated by the media, educational institutions and social and  individual behaviour at all levels to  educate publishers and teachers to the  negative aspects of sex-role stereotyping with a view to eliminating it  as soon as possible in the future.  Not all is gloomy on the horizon,  however; the most positive, if ironic,  visual image that we recorded was a  girl and boy working together at a  carpentry table in one of the schools.  When I asked her what she was making,  she calmly replied, "an ironing board"  - S. Purdy  marguerite   ritchie  Since 1970, the National Action  Committee on the Status of  Women including the Federation  of Business and Professional  Women of Canada (BWPC), has  been pushing for implementation  of recommendation 165 of the  report of the Royal Commission  on the Status of Women.  Recommendation 165 proposes the es  tablishment of a Human Rights  Commission.  The National Action Committee and the BWPC  are now pressuring the government for the immediate creation of the commission with  Marguerite Ritchie as its head.  Ms. Ritchie has an outsanding  record in the numan rights  field, having been described  as having "superior qualifications" for the proposed  position by the head of the  Human Rights Promotion Committee of the BWPC.  She is  presently the vice-chairperson  of the Anti-Dumping Tribunal  (orderly international distribution of goods) and a former counsel in the federal  Department of Justice.  In recent personal* contact  with Ms. Ritchie involving a  case of equal pay discrimination, I found her to be  most helpful, reassuring and  thorough in her approach. In  spite of her crushing schedule  she took the opportunity to  write several personal letters  to me answering every question  that I asked. She further encouraged me to correspond with  her about other facets of the  law and developments of the  case I was involved in. Most  important, she commented that  the only way we are going to  beat this discrimination problem is to keep at it on all  fronts.  I can think of no  better philosophy for the proposed Human Rights Commissioner  to have.  D.E.R.  This brochure was mailed  to many businesses in the  Vancouver Area.

He can  give her money, deprive her of  money, or make her plead and  grovel for it, as he chooses.  This injustice could be ended-  easily, quickly,, and without  causing economic upheaval.  A housewife's wage is the goods  and services that she provides.  In other words, if she bakes  bread, her wages are fresh bread,  If she washes dishes, her wages  are clean dishes.  Her husband's  wage is money. Marriage is an  economic partnership.  Traditionally, the woman produces  goods and services, and the  man earns money to buy goods  and services.  The man has access to the woman's contribution, but she does not necessarily have access to his.  I  have seen a woman beg her husband for a dime,#and be refused.  If she begs and gets it, she  still has had to beg.  The wife  in a traditional marriage is at  a basic disadvantage, because  if she were to withdraw her  services, the husband could buy  them elsewhere.  However, she  generally can't get money by  performing her duties as a full-  time housewife.  The husband  has control becuase he earns  the money.  I propose a way of  ending this injustice.  For lack  of a better word, I'll call it  Equity:  legally guaranteed access to half of a spouse's in  come.  Equity could be guaranteed by  requiring employers to pay half  of an employee's wages in the  employee's spouse's name.  This  could be done either automatically or at the spouse's request,  Of  If both husband and wife were  employed, the couple might receive four checks.  A spouse  could be legally entitled to  fifty percent of income from  other sources, such as capital  gains or dividends.  It has been suggested that housewives receive pay from the  government for the work  they do.  Unfortunately,  there are some damn serious  drawbacks to Housewive's  pay.  Households in which  the woman is employed outside  the home would probably pay  higher taxes to support the  program, and get nothing,  while households in which  the woman is a housewife  would benefit.  Often, the  poor would pay and the rich  would benefit.  Bad feelings  between employed women and  housewives would result.  Most employed women, and some  men, do housework.  If the  housewife were paid, many of  these people would bitterly  resent doing housework without pay.  If everybody were  paid a decent wage for doing  housework, many employed  people might be taxed almost  their entire earnings and  receive a housework grant in  return.  This might not necessarily be a bad idea, but it  would be a bi lumpy pill for  people to swallow.  A proposed  Housewife's Pay would surely  be damned as inflationary,  and would probably not be  adopted, if for that reason  alone.  Finally, Housewife's  Pay ignores the real wages of  a housewife's work: the washed  dishes, the cooked food, the  laundered clothes, and all the  other goods and services that  she provides.  A family profits  from the wages of an unpaid  housewife. With Housewife's  Pay, the family would profit  doubly at the expense of families in which the wife is em  ployed.  Under present circumstances, the family benefits  from a housewife's work, but  the housewife herself has no  money except what her husband  gives her.  Equity would correct this injustice without  unduly favoring the household  in which the wife works at  home.  Equity would offer all the benefits of Housewive's Pay, and  more besides, with none of the  drawbacks.  Equity would allow  housewives to have the freedom  and dignity of being financial  sauals within marriage.  Employed women would suffer no  loss.  Employed women who earn  less than their husbands would  gain economic clout. Equity  would help solve women's credit  problems - never again could  women be denied credit on the  grounds that women can evade  financial responsibilities by  becoming economically dependent housewives.  (I am not  defending the use of this excuse to deny women credit)  Equity would make guaranteed  incomes more feasable.  It would  be grossly unjust if married  women were not eligible for  guaranteed income.  If married women were eligible  for guaranteed income under  the present circumstances, it  would produce some of the same  difficulties as Housewives' Pay.  Taxes would be high, and much  money would go to well-to-do  households.  Housewives would  benefit at the expense of employed women.  With Equity, a  married woman's claim to guaranteed income, would be the same  as her husband's.  In wealthy  families, neither would be eli  gible; in poor families, both  would be eligible.  Equity would  benefit all women.  Equity now!  This one's a breeze.

A  brief note  from Ms.   Berg  owner of Thor's Hall in  Abbotsford.  Dear Ms.  Sent the article on discrimination  against women in some of the better  dining rooms to Don Bellamy, President of the Restaurant Association  asking him to take it up at the next  meeting; though a member I have not  attended since and though he mentioned my letter in our own 'paper',  doubt its been aired, but will speak  up first chance.  Being hostess in  my own dining room I've asked women  |  alone and they say yes also it's  happened to me.  May I suggest forming a group like  Penny Wise's 777, and when there's  an article we agree or disagree with  send it to the person either with  just your name comment or nothing.  (Ms) Katherine Berg 11  abortion    tribunal  Attention:  Newsletter Editor  It was suggested to us by Alice James  that we contact you about our current  campaign so that a few words about it  could be inserted into your next  newsletter.  Here is the information:  The Toronto Committee to Defend Dr.  Morgentaler and the Toronto Canadian  Women's Coalition to Repeal the  Abortion Laws are planning a Tribunal  on Abortion in Defense of Dr. Morgentaler in Ottawa to be held on March 9.  (Some further facts on the Morgentaler  case and its importance for Canadian  women follows).  In Vancouver we are also planning  actions.  We are collecting testimony  of women to be sent to the Tribunal,  we are getting endorsations from  unions, community organizations,  holding press conferences and are  planning a demonstration on March 9  (Saturday) at 2 p.m., at the Pacific  Centre with speakers, etc.  -We hope that the Status of Women would  endorse our actions and if possible,  make a financial contribution to the  campaign. We would also encourage  you to participate in the press conference and send a speaker to the  rally.  We shall be present at your next  meeting - Alice James has agreed to  put an item on the agenda under which  we can discuss the campaign.  Sincerely,  Isolde Belfont  B.C. Committee  to Defend Dr. Morgentaler  Dr. Henry Morgentaler, the renowned  Montreal physician charged with performing illegal abortions, was  acquitted on the first of 13 of such  charges last November.  This acquittal was an important initial victory  in the struggle of women to control  their own bodies.  The defense campaign on behalf of Dr. Morgentaler  has served to undermine the abortion  section of the Criminal Code, but  the struggle will not be won until  the remaining charges against Dr.  Morgentaler have been dropped and  the abortion laws repealed.  The prosecution (the Canadian  Government) has appealed the decisior  of the jury to the Quebec Court of  Appeals and the other 12 charges are  still pending.  It is more important  than ever to mobilize public support  in defense of Dr. Morgentaler and a  woman's right to choose abortion.  An Abortion Tribunal in Defense of  Dr. Morgentaler will take place in  Ottawa on March 9th.  Tribunal is a  term dating from the Romans meaning:  "A court or forum of justice, convened in the defense of the common  people".  It was empowered to direct  judgments to protect the individual  from arbitrary actions by officials.  The Tribunal in Ottawa will hear  testimony and evaluate evidence to  uphold its indictment of the government for the victimization of Dr.  Morgentaler and the women of Canada  under the cruel and unjust abortion  laws.  The indictment and demands of the  Tribunal will be presented by a  demonstration on Parliament Hill  to the self-appointed guardians of  women's bodies.  roll back prices  .C. CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEE TO  ROLL BACK PRICES held a conference  at the Vancouver Public Library on  February 9th.  Guest speakers were:  Alderman Harry Rankin  Grace Mclnnis MP Vancouver-Kingsway  Emil Bjarnason - Economist  Bridget Moran - Social Worker  Alderman Rankin outlined the problems  of inadequate housing and said the  answer lies in rent and price controls and public housing.  He also  stressed that citizen bodies must  be organized to put pressure on  government and force legislation.  Ms. Mclnnis spoke of the eftect tnac  rising prices have, particularly on  low=income families, and expressed  her disappointment that the Commons  Committee on Trends in Food Prices  received NO briefs from organized  citizen groups.  She suggested that  prices on some necessities should be  determined and frozen, an excess  profits tax be initiated, and that the  Food Prices Review Board expose profiteers.  Mr. Bjarnason gave a detailed account  of the effect of inflation on the  economy and governments fear of a  repetition of the 1930s depression.  Disputing the argument put forth by  business that price increases are due  to increased, labour costs, Mr. Bjarnason said that increased wage demands  are made to offset the rising cost of  living, not the other way round, and  cited an example showing a cost of  living increase of 9.1% in the same  period that wages rose 7%% and profit  on business rose 30%.  Ms. Moran described the problems of  people living on poverty-line income.  More than 25% of Canadians live on or  below the poverty line.  (Note:  See  Royal Commission Report on the Status  of Women, Chapter 6).  83 persons attended the conference  representing many organizations and  unions.  Vancouver Status of Women  were represented by Gene Errington  and Anne Howarth.  A permanent Committee was elected  from these groups to campaign for  legislative action, and Anne Howarth  agreed to represent the Vancouver  Status of Women on the Committee.  Anyone interested in working with the  Committee please call her at 736-3746  or 253-0820.  letters  Dear People,  Your January focus on Day Car, plus  numerous recent happenings in the  province, prompt me to urge that we  extend a sympathetic hand to another  large group of human beings whose  rights are imperilled - i.e. Kids.  I am not talking about the sort of  licentious permissiveness which Dr.  Spock lately repudiated - and which  I am not sure he ever intended to  recommend.  I am talking about allowing each child - as each woman and  each man - the maximum opportunity  to discover and develop an individual self, in a community with  other individuals.  Such opportunity is not fostered  by the alarmist and hysterical  shouting B.C. parents, including  mothers, have been engaging in.  Every day's newspaper includes  calls for the return of the venerable strap and "the once familiar  authoritarian regimes" (Sun, Jan 31,  page 7).  New ideas, such as those  in operation at City School, are  greeted not with questioning and  rational opposition, but with fear  and outrage and tightly closed  minds.  We don't need to rush into change  for change's sake, but neither do  we need to return to the Dark Ages.  Most kids I know like their mothers  to be real people.  Let's return  the f avour.
