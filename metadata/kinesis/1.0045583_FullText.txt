But we survived. So many things could  have gone wrong mis issue...but didn't.  Most of this is thanks to the hard work  and commitment of so many women.  We did manage to bring you lots of  stories we think are important, but as  usual—with every month, with every  year—there were a thousand more stories that make it into the pages of Kinesis.  We will be trying to follow up on  many of them in upcoming issues. For  now here's a sampling of what's been  going on.  As Kinesis goes to press, women are  still deciding whether or not to go to the  4th World Conference on Women in  Beijing in September. Women are concerned because the NGO forum has been  moved to Huairou, 40 kilometres away  from the official government meeting  site [see Kinesis May 1995]. Guess the  Beijinggovernmentthoughtthathaving  30,000womenactivistdescendonBeijing  was just a bit too much. And what are  the bets that the rest of the world governments aren't too upset about the  move.  After meeting in New York, women  with NGO forum facilitating committee  decided to give the Chinese government  and the UN an ultimatum—unless the  NGO forum is moved back to a more  suitable location, they may press for  cancellation of the conference. The facilities in Huairou are not accessible to  women with disabilities, and finding  transportation to Beijing—where the  government delegates are meeting—is  difficult. We'll give you.the updated  word on Beijing next month.  Closer to home, lesbians and gays  have won yet another court case. An  Ontario trial court recently ruled that  the provincial law preventing lesbians  and gays from adopting their non-bio-  -logical children they are already raising  is unconstitutional [see story, page 3].  In other court matters, the Supreme  Court of Canada is keeping pretty busy  these days. As Kinesis goes to press,  we've learned that they're just about to  release decisions in Egan and Nesbit, and  in Thibaudeau.  Egan and Nesbit, two gay men who  have lived together for over 46 years, are  challenging the Old Age Security Act  arguingthatitviolatestheequality rights  provisions of the Charter because it offers spousal pensions only to "heterosexual married and common law partners." This will be the first time the  Supreme Court is dealing with whether  sexual orientation is a prohibited grounds  of discrimination under the Charter, and  the definition of a "spouse."  The Supreme Court's ruling in  Thibaudeau will be of great significance  to a lot of women. Suzanne Thibaudeau  is challenging the income tax law requirement that she pay taxes on child  support she receives while her ex-husband gets a tax break [see Kinesis June  1994]. We'll tell you about the outcome  next month.  In case you haven't heard, Lloyd  Axworthy has shelved his plans for a  two-tiered UI, system. Looks like the  pressure from women's, anti-poverty,  and labour groups finally got to him.  Axworthy had been saying that repeat  users—such as seasonal workers—  should get a lower amount of unemployment insurance. Insteadhe wants to  offer them job counselling and some  skills training.  Basically, what he's saying is that  seasonal workers are abusing the UI  system...what he seems to have forgot-  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members and donors who support  us year 'round with memberships and donations.

And also, he  ' seems to have forgotten that his government promised to create jobs. We're getting really tired of waiting for the liberals to keep their promises.  And just because the liberal government has backed down a little on  targetting unemployed people, doesn't  mean they've eased up any on their  reactionary corporatist agenda. Nope,  the liberals are still going ahead with lots  of their "deficit cutting" measures that  particularly target women, poor people,  working class people and people of colour [see stories, page 5 and 6]. Sigh...will  it ever end?  Well, that's about all we have space  for this month. When next Kinesis goes to  press with our July/August issue, we'll  bebringingyoulotsof articles and information on new reproductive technologies and the politics of choice. And we'll  also be celebrating a number of anniversaries. Whose anniversaries, you ask?  Well, you'll just have to wait and read.  So until then, have happy times in  the sunshine...  As we begin every edition of Inside  Kinesis, here's a weather update from  Vancouver. As Kinesis goes to  press...oops that's for another  column...the sky is blue and the sun is  shining in Vancouver. It's very beautiful  outside. But here inside Kinesis, it's very  cold because unfortunately, we don't  have control over the thermostat. But  hey, at least we'll have one day off to  play in the sun before we start again to  bring you all the news about women  that's not in the dailies.  We do have some happy news to  report from inside Kinesis—our dear and  beloved outgoing editor, Fatima Jaffer,  is recovering comfortably (and somewhat restfully) from her surgery. And  even from her hospital bed, Fatima  wouldn't let Kinesis down—she did her  best to make sure the new editor had her  . supportand thebenefitof her morphine-  laden wisdom.  Fatima's doctors tell us that we'll  have to wait at least two more weeks  before we can have her back on the  Editorial Board or pile her up with lots  of stories to write...good thing we're  patient. We're just really glad that  Fatima's doing well.  This issue of Kinesis would not have  happened without the tremendous effort and support of a lot of women (or at  least it wouldn't have happened without our new editor getting an ulcer).  Thanks to Fatima Jaffer, Janisse Browning, Nancy Poliak and Wendy Frost for  their help editing the pages of Kinesis.  And an amazing thank you to all the  women who came in...with minimal  begging. ..during production to help out  writing, proofing, and with layout.  And a final thank you to Ed Boarder  wendy lee kenward for bringing us  healthy things to eat—especially since  some of us often forget to eat during  production...our moms thank you.  Hey do you notice the new snazzy  look on the pages of Kinesis? Yes, there's  lots more graphics and lots more white  space. We're just thrilled about it too!  And do you know who's fault...er,  brilliance...it is? ...our new production  coordinator, Laiwan.  Laiwan is well known around this  town for her work designing other publications like Front Magazine and the arts  pages of Angles, and for her work as a  multi-disciplinary artist (some of her  work is currently showing in Seattle., .so  go check it out).  In less than one month, Laiwan has  revolutionalized our production room  and our computer systems. She intro  duced us to the world of "scanning" and  is responsible for all the cool graphic  images you see throughout Kinesis, and  she brought in a computer monitor that  doesn't hurt our eyes—Thanks to Moira  Keigher for the loaner.

This month, we got two new members of the Editorial Board: Robyn Hall  and Alex Hennig. Robyn has been volunteering with Kinesis as a writer and in  production for almost three years, and  we've now been able to convince her  that the Ed Board is lots of fun. Alex is a  regular production volunteer and she's  a whiz on PageMaker. And as her first  task as an Ed Board member, she managed to get us a waxer on permanent  loan (ours broke last month). Thanks.  And welcome on board, Robyn and Alex.

Or if you can't make it,  give Agnes a call at 255-5499.  Welcome also to our new production volunteers: Grace Wandolo and  Holly MacKenzie. Grace and Holly were  busy away working in the office when  we approached them with a "please,  please, please proof these..." (hey, that  rhymes). If you too want to join in on all  the production fun, give Laiwan a call at  255-5499. Production for the July/August issue will be from June 22 to 27.  One last thing from Inside  Kinesis—usually at this time, we tell you  all about our fabulous, fun-filled annual  Kinesisbenefit(usualryheldinJune).But  this year, because of lots of things happening at Kinesis, the Ed Board has decided to postpone the benefituntil sometime in September or October. We'll let  you know next issue exactly when it's  going to happen. Stay tuned.  Well that's it for this edition of Inside Kinesis. We hope you have a great  month! Bye for now. News  Ontario court ruling on lesbian adoption:  My mothers are  lesbians I".  by Lissa Geller  After years of struggling for equal  rights before the law, lesbians and gays  won a small but important battle in  Ontario last month. Four lesbians have  been awarded the right to adopt under  an Ontario court ruling which found  that denying lesbian and gay parents the  right to adopt children they were already raising was not justifiable. The  court found that the section of the Child  and Family Services Act of Ontario which  prevented lesbians from adopting was  unconstitutional.  The case involved four couples who  all had been with the children since their  births. Although the biological mothers  were all the legal parents of the children,  their partners were not considered  spouses and, under the law, were not  eligible to adopt the children. The restriction meant that the non-biological  parents' rights were severely curtailed.  For example, they could not sign  legal documents affecting their children  and could be prevented from having  access to their children in hospital. As  well, in the event of a breakdown in the  couple's relationship, non-biological  parents had no legal standing with respect to the children they co-parented.  They could be denied access and visitation rights on the whim of the biological  parent.  "We take our kids to school as two  parents, we go to family celebrations as  two parents...we even have family memberships at the zoo and the museum...  (This decision allows us) to know the  children we love are ours forever," says  Alison Kemper, one of the mothers involved in the case.  Lesbian and gay human rights  groups were elated by the ruling. "Our  community has been vindicated by the  court. We are full citizens of this country with full constitutional rights as  working people and as parents," says  Susan Ursel, a Toronto lawyer who  spoke on behalf of the Foundation for  Equal Families. The Foundation was  formed in Ontario in 1994 after the  defeat of a bill that would have extended employee benefits to same-sex  couples in that province.  Brendan Crawley, a spokesperson  for the Ontario Attorney General, suggested that the ruling may not have  immediate ramifications for other lesbians and gay men wishing to adopt children. Crawley noted that the decision  was made at the lowest court level and  "really only deals with the four couples  involved. It doesn't bind other judges or  other levels of court."  Nonetheless, there is nothing to prevent other lesbians and gay men from  applying to adopt children under the  current law, although they would likely  also face a court challenge.  The Ontario court's decision may  yet have a positive impact on the fight  for same-sexspousal benefits, says Laurie  Pawlitza who, along with Judy Parrack,  represented the couples involved,noted  that "judges are frequently very influenced by decisions of other judges particularly when there is a significant  amount of evidence..."  Despite that, University of Ottawa  law professor Cynthia Peterson doubts  there will be a flood of victories on  spousalbenefits. "Thedecision definitely  promotes equality for lesbians and gay  men but...you still have to put the burden on the government to justify any  legislation," says Peterson. What would  help more would be a political decision  by the government to change the legislation to eliminate discrimination on the  basis of sexual orientation.  Chris Phibbs, one of the women involved in the case, noted that "the courts  instead of the people we elect [are now  leading Ontario]." This has led to a slow  process of legal battles where lesbians  and gays have usually won their cases  but only after substantial cost and time.  Although recent rulings have favoured  the extension of rights of lesbians and  gays, Brenda Grossman, a family law  professor at York University's Osgoode  Hall, is quick to point out that a political  solution in the near future is unlikely.  "Every [government] who has moved  forward [to extend lesbian and gay  rights] has basically chickened out on  this issue," says Crossman.  InBritish Columbia, thegovernment  recently changed its adoption rules to  allow single lesbians and gay men to  adopt healthy children. In the past, provisions allowed them only to adopt children with special needs.  However, they are still notallowed  to adopt as couples or to adopt their  partner's biological children. The government may be poised to make changes  regarding this legislation which would  allow for adoptions as couples, but any  reforms will be subject to a full debate  in the legislature and that may doom  them to defeat like their counterpart in  Ontario.

News  Feminist magazine closes:  Losing Herspective  by Faith Jones  Mary Billy, the dynamo who virtually single-handedly edited, produced  and published a feminist creative writing magazine, has decided to call it a  day. Herspectives, a quarterly produced  in Billy's Squamish, BC home for the  past six years, stopped publishing as of  May 1 this year.  "When I look at that stack of magazines I am very proud of what we accomplished together, and I'm sure that  all those wonderful, wise,strong healers  and peacemakers will find other ways to  get their work out there," Billy wrote  when she announced the closure.  Herspectives published essays, short  stories, poetry, art and graphics by.  women. Billy says her main editorial  policy was simply to allow women to  express themselves. Aside from a few  guidingprinciples—no violence, racism,  homophobia, et cetera—the magazine allowed a variety of viewpoints to be put  forward without editorial changes. "We  had only one rule, to break all the rules,"  says Billy.  Billy says both money and health  reasons forced the closure, not because  she's in bad health but because after  '   II     Il   )l      ■    '    1  Ills  years of illness she is finally healthy  enough to get a paying job. For six years  the magazine has taken a great deal of  her time and energy, but has never paid  her a living wage. The magazine survived on subscriptions, a few advertisers, and donations. All the writing and  artwork was donated.  Billy started Herspectives after talking to her friend, writer Gert Beadle.  Beadle's self-published work was selling well at feminist gatherings, but she  couldn't get a publisher interested in it.  Billy and Beadle together drew up some  notes for a magazine. A few months  later, Billy sentoutlettersdescribingher  vision to 40 or 50 people/and received 8  paid subscriptions in response. "That's  what we started on," she says. For the  first few years, Beadle had a regular  column.  In spite of the hard work and lack of  pay, Billy says creating a magazine was  a truly fulfilling experience. "What kept  megoingwasgettingletters from women  saying they hadn't thought they would  ever find a magazine like it," she says.  She says she would do it again in a  second if she could figure out a way to  get paid for her work. She says it could  easily have become a monthly, based on  the amount of quality material that was  submitted.  One important resource Billy continues to work on is the Femicide List.  This is a list of names and synopses of  cases of females murdered by men in  Canada. There are over 600 cases listed,  most of them from within the last five  years. Billy plans to continue to add to  this list, and invites people to share information with her. Friends and relatives of murdered women can also write  to make sure their loved ones' names are  on the list, (see address below)  In addition to the Femicide List,  Billy also has some back issues of  Herspectives available at $5 each. For  now, Billy is looking for work as a resource person on feminist issues, and  she plans to spend some time on her own  writing. She has a weekly column in a  local Squamish paper, and wants to find  a publisher for her poetry and short  stories. While she is sad at the demise of  Herspectives, she is also celebrating what  the magazine accomplished. "We were  an outlet for women who were really  saying things, important things," she  says.

Protesting parole hearing of convicted rapist  A call for  accountability  by wendy lee kenward   On May 11, 30 people gathered in  front of the parole board office in New  Westminister, BC to demonstrateagainst  the parole hearing of John Horace  Oughton, a convicted rapist.  The demonstration was organized  to show support for survivors of  Oughton's assaults and to raise public  awareness of his crimes and the parole  process. The protesters—mostly survivors of Oughton's assaults and their  families and friends—also, demanded  accountability from authorities.  The demonstrators were concerned  that the parole office did not.inform  survivors or the public that Oughton  was coming up for parole, and that authorities did not ensure the hearing was  accessible. Out of the 60 people who  applied to attend the hearing, only 16  were allowed in.  Oughton—known as the "Paper Bag  Rapist"-was convicted in 1987 of 14  sexual assaults. However, it is believed  that he raped approximately 170 girls  and women in the Lower Mainland between June 1977 and May 1985.  Oughton received an indefinite sentence for the sexual assaults and was  designated a dangerous offender. Under the criminal code, dangerous of  fenders are entitled to a parole hearing  after one year of incarceration, and every  two years after. At his hearing, Oughton  was denied parole.  Those who demonstrated at the parole office say Oughton does not even  deserve to be considered for parole, and  called on authorities to ensure that he  remain behind bars for life.  Some of the people who attended  Oughton's hearing were concerned  about their own safety. After the hearing, they learned that Oughton could  have access to their names.  Demonstrators were also concerned  that authorities did not inform survivors and the general public mat a dangerous offender was having a parole  hearing. The demonstration was organized after survivors became aware of  Oughton's parole hearing through a column in a local newspaper.  Overall, demonstrators feel the protest was successful in showing support  for survivors, and raising awareness  around dangerous offenders and the  parole process. "A lot of people showed  up, and the media response was excellent," says one of the organizers.  wendy lee kenward is a regular  volunteer with Kinesis.

In reality, the government is  scapegoating these communities for 20  years of policies that have caused a revalue crisis but is being called a deficit  crisis.  With its latest budget, the federal  government introduced a new landing  fee for the right to merely apply for landed  immigrant status [see Kinesis April 1995].  The government has also indicated it will  require a sponsorship bond from people  who want to sponsor family members as  immigrants. And the federal government's has said it is looking into privatizing settlement services, which will likely  result in user fees for services such as  English as a second language (ESL) training.  The federal government's new policies on immigrants and refugees especially targets women, and in particular  women from countries in the South. The  government's new policies will have a  devastating impact on their ability to  enter Canada, their independence, and  on their well being.  The new head tax  As of February 28, all immigrants  and refugees over the age of 19 are required to pay a $975 "landing fee" upon  entering Canada, to be considered for  landed immigrant status. The government's new head tax is on top of the $500  "processing fee" already in place.  The government expects to make $146  million from the landing fee, which will  be channeled directly into the government's general coffers, and not into settlement services for immigrants and refugees.  The government has stated that the  $975 landing fee is not discriminatory  because it applies equally to everyone.  But given that we live in a world of great  disparities between women and men;  between people of colour and white people; between the "Third World" and the  "First World", this head tax will make it .  especially difficult for many women of  colour to enter or remain in Canada as  permanent resident.  To counter criticism of the head tax,  Sergio Marchi, the minister of citizenship  and immigration, announced that his  government would set up a loan program to ensure that immigrants and refu-  gees would not bedenied entry to Canada  simply because they cannot afford the  landing fee.  To be eligible for a loan, applicants  need to meet the "ability to pay" criteria—the same criteria required for any  bank loan. Recent reports already indicate that 50 percent of those who have  applied for a loan have been turned  down—including people already accepted into Canada as convention refu-  . Sponsorship bond  The federal governmentisalso making it more difficult for people to bring  in their family members. People who  wish to sponsor members to Canada  grant settlementagencies,and individual  immigrant and refugees themselves.  The federal government's cutback  occurs on top of many years of reductions to much needed programs, such as  -NO  TO  HEAD  TAX!!  will soon have to put up a cash bond or  other guarantee in order to reunite with  their families.  The government has already said  the bond is a sure thing, they're just  deliberating over how much it should  be—maybe as much as $20,000. The  majority of people coming in under the  family class category are women, and  the bond will make it even more difficult for women, particularly women of  colour, to immigrate to Canada.  If sponsored immigrants receive  social assistance (or other services not  yet defined), the government would  deduct the cost of those services directly out of the posted bond.  For women sponsored under the  family class category, the bond will  leave them much more dependent on  family members. Given the level of violence against all women, taking away  their independence is clearly unacceptable. Also, many women who wish to  sponsor family members will find that  they can no longer do so since few will  likely be able to put up $20,000 in advance.  Cutting settlement services  The federal government has also  clearly stated that it will no longer provide direct delivery of settlement services for immigrants and refugees. In  cutting funding for such services, the  government is off loading its responsibility to provinces governments, immi-  ESL classes and job skills training. Even  with government funding, most of these  programs have long waiting lists.  Many provincial governments have  already said they will not make up for  the loss of federal funding. Service agencies—most of whom rely substantially  on government funding—will be expected to seek private sources of funding or provide less services.  In addition, there appears to be no  mechanism in place to protect immigrants from user fees. Many who work  at immigrant and refugee agencies expect that user fees will soon be put into  place to cover the cost of the services.  There may beno regulation of meamount  of user fees required or of the level or  quality of service provided.  Introducing user fees for settlement  services means that immigrants will be  paying twice for much needed resources •—once through paying taxes, and  again when they need to access services.  For women, who only recently won the  right to have access to some of these  services, this is a giant leap backwards.  As usual, women—who have least access to economic power—will be the last  to gain English language and job skills  training.  Basically, immigrante will be expected to cover all their own costs of  living in Canada, even though they already pay more in taxes than they use in  social services. Denying immigrants and  refugees public access to programs and  services, making them pay for them privately, violates the principles of equality  and equity. And placing extra financial  burdens on immigrants simply because  they use settlement services is illogical,  for the entire community benefits - not  just the immigrants themselves.  The federal government is clearly  pandering to the anti-immigrant hysteria led by the Reform Party which believes that immigrants are a drain on  Canadian society, and should be supported by volunteers and their own families.  This of course, means adding to the  already incredible responsibilities of  women. Many women who are now  employed to provide such services are  in danger of losing those paid jobs, and  while other women will be forced to pick  up the slack as volunteers.  Also, we will see greater disparities  between the provinces in regards to the  quantity and quality of settlement services. But even those provinces which  may want to provide a decent level of  settlement services will find that they  have less money to do so. Less money  always means less social services and  more of a hardship for women.  As in its attack on social programs,  the government is blaming people in  Canada for failing social policies while  doing nothing to reduce the problems  we face. Instead of collecting deferred  corporate taxes or embarking on a meaningful job creation strategy, the government is off loading responsibility onto  immigrants whoalready contribute more  than their share'to society.  Fighting back  A number of actions and campaigns  have been organized to challenge the  government's targetting of immigrants  and refugees. In April, TCAR (the Toronto Coalition Against Racism) held a  rally outside the liberal party headquarters in Toronto to protest the $975 head  tax [see Kinesis May 1995].  In Vancouver, a coalition of women's, anti-racist and progressive organizations—the Network for Immigrants'  and Refugees' Rights—has initiated a  petition and postcard campaign. INTERCEDE, the Toronto domestic workers'  rights organization, has also organized a  petition campaign. And the National  Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC) has taken the campaign  nationally.  On June 12, as part of NAC's annual  lobby of federal members of Parliament,  the groups will present the petitions to  federal finance minister Paul Martin.

Rights. News  Feds attack key economic rights:  Knocking off the CAP  by Jean Swanson   Canadians may not know mat their  government is about to eliminate the  only legal economic human rights we  have, but officials at the United Nations  do and are concerned about it.  The rights that are about to become  history are found in the Canada Assistance Plan Act which, in 1966, established the Canadian Assistance Plan  (CAP) to provide Canadians with adequate social services and welfare. More  importantly, CAP set national standards for welfare provision that all provincial governments must meet in order  to be eligible for federal contributions to  their social services costs.  Under CAP, all Canadians have:  •the right to income when in need;  •the right to an amount of income  that takes into account budgetary requirements;  •the right to appeal decisions about  welfare that they think are unfair;  •the right not to have to work or  train for welfare; and  •the right to income assistance regardless of what province they live in  [the moblility right].  Bill C-76, introduced into Parliament  in late March, and expected to be proclaimed in early July, will eliminate the  first four of these rights as of April 1,  1996. The mobility right will ostensibly  be preserved, but, because people won't  have the right to income when in need or  the right to appeal, it could be virtually  useless.  Three of Canada's activist anti-poverty organizations, the National Anti-  Poverty Organization (NAPO), the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC), and the Charter Committee on Poverty Issues (CCPI) have  appealed to the United Nations for support in their campaign to defeat Bill C-76.  NAC hasbeen extremely active over  the past year in coalitions dedicated to  preserving Canada's social security system, and proposals going forward to its  1995 annual general meeting call for a  broader fightback to protect universality and eliminate women's poverty. The  struggle to undermine CAP protections  will doubtless be a key part of NAC's  expanding campaign.  In early May, Sarah Sharpe, a former  president of NAPO from Newfoundland and Vince Calderhead, a Vancouver lawyer with CCPI, gained a meeting  with the United Nations Committee on  Social, Economic and Cultural Rights in  Geneva describing how Bill C-76 will  "revoke all legal protection of the right  to an adequate income in Canada"...and  will cut $7 billion from federal transfer  payments for social programs.  Why should the UN care about economic human rights in Canada? In 1976,  Canada and many other countries signed  the UN Covenant on Social, Economic  and Cultural Rights. Among other things,  the Covenant commits Canada to recognizing the rights of all Canadians to "an  adequate standard of living...and to the  continuous improvement of living conditions." It also commits Canada to recognizing "the right of everyone to gain  his [sic] living by work which he [sic]  freely chooses or accepts-..."(my italics).  In 1993, when Canada was last  monitored, NAPO and theCCPI wentto  Geneva to report that Canada had not  been living up to its commitments to  reduce poverty. The Committee, which  monitors compliance with the Covenant  by collecting reports from each country  every five years, issued a stern warning  to Canada, calling on it to incorporate  social and economic rights in legislation,  train the judiciary on Canada's obliga-  their jobs and hours taken over by people on welfare, forced by necessity to  work at half the going rate.  Because the federal government has  drastically reduced the dollars they  transfer toprovinces for social programs  since 1990, even provinces that want to  treat poor people decently, are having to  cope with lack of funding for welfare.  Some provinces may be forced to gradually reduce the amount of benefits and  the number of people who are eligible  for benefits—even if unemploymentand  need escalate.  Sharpe and Calderhead were able to  convince the UN Committee that Bill C-  tions under the Covenant, and undertake "concerted action to eliminate the  need for food banks."  Since meCommittee'swarning,new  statistics show that poverty is increasing  by about one percent a year across  Canada, and that over 60 percent of  single parents and young people living  alone are in poverty.  Without the rights in the Canadian  Assistance Plan, it will be perfectly legal  for premiers like Alberta's Ralph Klein  .to deny welfare to people in need.  Women who now have access to social  assistance if they have to leave their  abusive spouse, could be left without  resources, and it may be perfectly legal  to provide so little welfare that more  people will have to live on the streets.  Without CAP rights, people in need  could be forced to work for their welfare  cheque (workfare) in violation of the  Covenant requirement that work be  freely chosen. The right not to have to  work for welfare is an important economic right for all Canadians, not only  people on welfare. It equally protects  working people from having to reduce  their wages to compete with people on  welfare who could be forced into their  jobs.  This is already happening in Alberta  and New Brunswick, and the federal  government is refusing to enforce existing CAP rights. People working as nursing and teaching assistants are seeing  76 poses a serious threat to the economic  rights of Canadians. The Committee  agreed, for the first time ever, to hear a  presentation from a non-governmental  organization (NGO) on a country whose  five year reporting cycle wasn't complete.  TheCommittee's initial reaction was  mild. It wrote to Canada's ambassador  to the United Nations and said that the  Committee "would welcome observations by the Canadian government on  the issue of its conformity with the  Covenant...later this year." There is still  hope that the UN Committee will admonish Canada as it did in 1993.  In the meantime, NAPO and its provincial member groups are lobbying  Members of Parliament about the rights  in the Canada Assistance Plan. With the  exception of Svend Robinson, none of  the MPs lobbied to date have been able  to even name more than two of the five  rights they will probably soon vote to  abolish.   Jean Swanson works at End Legislated Poverty and is president of the  National Anti-Poverty Organization.  And, she's worn out trying to get the  corporate media to recognize that the  government is about to end crucial  economic rights for Canadians, and  frustrated because virtually no one knows  this is happening.  ?rrelpsavfe -tflb*'  HELP C^Sg^'5  ^J^^Legislated Poverty (ELP)  has launched a lobbying campaign  against Bill j£f 6. ELP intends to  educate MPs and ML As about Canadian's basic welfare rights as  guaranteed under the Canada Assistance Plan.  ELP is also lobbying provincial  politicians to legislate the CAP rights  provincially. BC social services minister Joy MacPhail is on record as  supporting the five key rights under  CAP. However, the Premier's Fo-  rum, an advisory body whose members are appointed by the provincial  government, has just issued a report that calls for workfare foryoung  people and quasi-workfare for older  people While the NDP party did  pass a resolution at its convention  supportingthefive rights underCAP,  such resolutions are not binding on  the government.  ELP has a form letter that can  be sent to MLAs and MPs asking  them to preseve the rights in CAP.  Call 879-1209 if you'd like a copy or  would like to volunteer on this campaign.

Butthegood  news on the legal front was dampened  by Dow Corning Corporation's announcement a few days later that it is  filing for bankruptcy to avoid dealing  with litigation over the controversial  implants. Dow Corning is the major  manufacturer of siliconebreastimplants.  The BC legislation to allow class-  action suits will come into effect August  1 and opens the door for groups of  people to collectively launch civil lawsuits. The legislation has special significance for the estimated 1,100 BC women  who are suing companies for ill health  effects from the implants. Lawyers say  the class-action suits will prove less expensive and more efficient for women  and will garner faster settlements.  Women with the implants have suffered from painful breasts caused by  scar tissue, and auto-immuhe illnesses  such as arthritis, lupus and chronic  fatigue.  The move by Michigan-based Dow  Corning to seek bankruptcy protection  received tentative reactions from Canadian lawyers working on the case.  Deborah Acheson who represents  about 300 BC women said that women  should be concerned but not alarmed by  the announcement, and should wait to  see the ramifications of the bankruptcy  proceedings. Other lawyers across the  country were likewise assuring their clients that they should wait and see. The  possibility of filing suits against Dow  Corning parent corporation, Dow  Chemical and Dow Corning Canada is  another option being considered.  Although Dow has claimed there is  no scientific evidence to support the  women's claims of auto-immune diseases, the company pledged $2 billion  over 30 years to a $4.25 billion "global"  settlement fund set up to compensate  women with the implants. However, a  paltry 3 percent of the fund was set aside  for women outside the US/even though  half the implants were sold outside of  the U.S. Many Canadian women opted  to go the route of litigation.  In Canada, an estimated 10,000  women are taking legal action for compensation. Up to 150,000 Canadian  women have the implants.  Buffer zones for  abortion clinics  Women in BC are welcoming moves  from the BC governmentthat promise to  ease the harassment of women and staff  at abortion clinics.  Provincial health minister Paul  Ramsay-announced in mid-May that the  government will soon table a bill that  will make it illegal for anti-choice protesters to picket, block or harass women  and health care workers in designated  "buffer zones," including areas around  abortion clinics and the homes of doctors who perform abortions. Breaking  the law carries sentences of up to six  months in jail and fines.  Pro-choice activists are exuberant  about the proposed law. "This is going  to fill a hole of protection that's been  needed for a long time for providers of  abortion services," said Kim Zander of  the Everywoman's Health Centre.  Currently, abortion clinics must  apply for court injunctions to prevent  harassment and picketing by anti-choice  protestors.  Increasing violence and harassment  towards staff at Vancouver abortion clinics culminated last November with the  shooting of Dr. Garson Romalis, a Vancouver gynecologist who performsabor-  tions. Ramsey acknowledged that the  attack, which took place at the doctor's  home, was a key factor in drafting the  new legislation.  "We would not tolerate the sort of  harassment and intimidation that has  gone on in the case of therapeutic abortion, if itwasdirected to any other health  service," said Ramsey in announcing the  legislation. "And we shouldn't tolerate  it here."  Accrediting  immigrants'  credentials  Canadian 'Woman Studies/ks cafliers de (a femme.

Under  the program, a panel will establish regulations that will allow employers and  degree holders to reach agreement on  acceptable credentials in a number of  professions.  Currently, many immigrants to  Canada find they cannot gain access to  opportunities in their field because their  qualifications are not recognized. The  program is a joint effort of the provincial  ministries of multiculturalism and labour and the Open Learning Institute, a  distance education college.  BC government  campaigns against  violence  BC's ministry of women's equality  launched its "Prevention of Violence  Against Women" week with the publication of a pamphlet aimed at providing  women and their employers with information on personal and workplace  safety. The glossy, full color poster folds  down into a pamphlet and emphasizes  basic awareness and prevention, taking  action against an attack and workplace  action. Itencourages employers to introduce safety measures, train staff and  develop safety programs.  Laura McCoy, a counsellor at Vancouver's Women Against Violence  Against Women (WAV AW), commends  the poster campaign as a way to keep  women informed about personal safety,  pointing out that campaigns that focus  on, "why men are so violent are also  needed."  "It's really frustrating," McCoy says,  "because itshouldn'tbeour responsibility to stop the cycle of violence, it should  be the responsibility of men... Women  wouldn't have problems working alone,  if men didn't rape women."  The Ministry also announced  $250,000 of funding for 11 violence prevention projects across the province this  year. Projects focus on elders, youth,  Aboriginal women, date rape and violence against women in the workplace.  Sisters suing police  and BC government  Two First Nations women are suing  the RCMP and the BC ministry of social  services for failing to take action when  they complained of sexual abuse by their  adoptive parents. The case, believed to  be the first of its kind in BC, goes to court  June 5.  Donna and Marie Lewis were seven  and four years old when they were apprehended from their mother and  adopted by a federal civil servant and  his wife. The sisters recently sued adoptive parents John and Helen Lewis, and  settled out of court. Both girls had been  abused sexually and physically for years.  The sisters say they are suing the  RCMP and the provincial government  because, despite knowing about the  abuse, neither did anything to stop it.  The women say that in September 1974,  an RCMP officer who took statements  from them about the sexual abuse, but  did nothing. And they say a social worker  took no action despite knowing that  John Lewis had raped the younger sister.  "I thought they might do something  to make it stop," says Donna Lewis. "I  was thinking every day a policeman or a  social worker would come to get me. But  no one came."  Donna Lewis says she hopes other  adults who were abused as children will  speak out and hold accountable the people who failed to protect them as children.  "I've been spending most of my life  trying to recover from the pain of my  childhood," she says. "For many years  I've carried the guilt. But it's up to them  now to take on the responsibility, and to  realize their inaction damaged people."  Sheadds/'NowthatTmdoingsome-  thing I don't feel so angry. I'm having  the people who abused and neglected us  own up. Each little step is another weight  lifted off my shoulder."  In mid-May, John Lewis, who now  lives in Ontario, pleaded guilty to two  charges of gross indecency and two  charges of indecent assault on a woman.  He was given indefinite probation.  yi£ed&nforb& creative and critical contributions to current debates  within women's community, theory and subcultures  Jccfa  fan>, theory, poetry, interviews, art and more!

First Nations law  conference  The Native Community Law Office  Association of British Columbia is holding a First Nations conference to explore  an approach to community-based treatment services for victims and offenders  that are based on traditional values. The  conference will be held from June 15 to  17, at the International Plaza, Squamish  Nation, 1999 Marine Drive, North Vancouver.  The conference will look at the challenge First Nations communities face in  trying to restore traditional balance  through community-based delivery of  health, child/family, educational and  judicial services.  Some of the areas of discussion are:  the creation of community-based services for victims and offenders, traditional justice systems and how they fit  into a modern context, the concerns of  Aboriginal women, elders, and youth in  relation to the current justice system and  treatment programs that promote healing for generational victims of residential schools.  Panelists and presenters will be from  the First Nations, federal and provincial  governments and from community service organizations.  The conference fee is $300, and includes an information package and  lunches. Registration deadline is June 7.

Labour and social  movements solidarity  network  The Maquila Solidarity Network, a  new initiative to promote solidarity between Canadian, Mexican and Central  American labour and social movements,  has been formed to raise standards and  improve conditions in maquiladora  zones.  With the spread of free trade, workers throughout the Americas are being  threatened with lower wages, cutbacks  in social services includingmedical care,  and poorer safety and environmental  standards. This situation is the worst in  the maquiladoras, the special industrial  zones spread throughout Mexico and  Central America. In the maquiladoras,  multinational corporations have set up  their factories, employing mostly  women, at extremely low wages.  The goal of the Network is to develop a broad, cross-sectional network  of Canadian labour, women's, anti-poverty and other groups to act together on  drives and campaigns with Mexican and  Central American groups. The organizing strategies will connect community  and workplace issues, address health  and environmental problems and look  closely at the problems of the female  workforce.  The Maquila Solidarity Network is  a joint project of Solidarity Works, a  network of union activists and labour  educators across English Canada, and  Mujer a Mujer (Woman to Woman), a  continental women's network focusing  on the impact of free trade and restructuring on women.

The march will start at 1pm  at the Vancouver Art Gallery and end at  2pm with a rally at the BC provincial law  courts on Smythe Street.  Voices Against Violence was first organized in response to the spread of the  ideology of "false memory syndrome"—  the idea that adult survivors of child  sexual abuse have had their memories  implanted by their feminist therapists  and that their memories are false.  Last year's rally was held in front of  the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) building in Vancouver to  protest the extensive pro-FMS coverage  in the mainstream media.  This year's rally will focus on the  legal system and its part in the backlash  against survivors of violence. The committee organizing the march and rally—  the Against the Backlash committee of  SPAN (Service Providers Adult/ Advocacy Network)—say they have uncovered a Manitoba RCMP investigational  guidelines document, "Indicators of  False Allegations," which shows that  law enforcement agencies support FMS.  The committee says the document says  that police officers can assume an allegation of abuse is false if the survivor is  accusing both parents of abuse, describes  ritualized events, or has read The Courage to Heal, a guide for women survivors  of childhood sexual abuse written by  Ellen Bass and Laura Davis.  The rally will feature speakers, entertainment, poetry, open mike and live  music. The rally will also address the  intention ofa US-based lobbying group—  which supports FMS—to draft legislation restricting the type of therapy available to childhood trauma survivors, and  to allow for third party suits against  therapists.

A message from the Public Service Alliance of Canada   •   (604) 430-5631 Feature  4th World Conference on Women:  No easy road to Beijing  by Agnes Huang  Over 1400 women gathered in New  York in March and worked feverishly to  ensure that the concerns and rights of all  women are reflected in the Platform for  Action-the document to be ratified by  world governments at the 4th World  Conference on Women in Beijing [see  Kinesis May 1995].  The New York Preparatory Committee meeting—the39th session of theCom-  mission on the Status of Women—provided the final opportunity before the  Beijing conference in September for  women from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to have input into the  Platform for Action.  Women attending the New York  PrepCom formed caucuses to address _  concerns with the Platform. There were  caucuses of lesbians, Aboriginal women,  women working in support of migrant  workers, women of colour, young  women, and refugee women.  The lesbian caucus lobbied to ensure  that the presence of lesbians at the Beijing  conference will be the most organized  ever. International lesbian organizations  have launched several campaigns, and  have called on the Secretariat of the 4th  World Conference on Women to intervene in cases where lesbians have been  turned down for accreditation and/or  visas. [So far, only a handful of countries,  including Canada, have agreed to officially recognize the importance of lesbian issues in their national reports.]  For almost every section of the Platform for Action, groups of women  worked on the language and ideas contained in those sections to make sure they  reflect what women want. Caucus members reviewed and amended portions of  the Platform dealing with the outlined  critical areas of concern such as, health,  violence against women, globalization,  media, education, human rights, and  the effects of armed conflict on women.  The women of colour caucus  pushed for the acknowledgement of  how racism affects the lives of women  of colour in both the so-called First and  Third Worlds. The effect of racism on  women'siives is not really recognized  in the Platform for Action, except in the  opening section which sets out the context for the document.  The women of colour caucus tried  to identify all the possible sections and  lines of the Platform where the issuesof  racism and the concerns of women of  colour could be included, says Mirai  Cho, a member of the International  Work Committee of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women  (NAC). Cho also works for the Korean  Canadian Women's Association in Toronto.  The caucus—consisting of over 50  groups mostly representing women of  colour living in the North—also issued  a statement focusing on the impact of  global restructuring on women. In it,  the caucus said that "the present profit-  driven global economic structures are  systemically and historically racist,  making [women of colour] the most  vulnerable to extreme poverty and to  every violation of women's human  rights."  Mirai Cho says that women of colour  in the North issued the statement in solidarity with "the struggles of our sisters in  the South and [to] affirm the historical  and current linkages between us."  Fely Villasin, vicepresidentofNAC,  adds that "the issues of women of colour  often get bypassed. It's a struggle to  bring in language [into the Platform]  that will put a face to women who are  always marginalized."  At the PrepCom, women working  in the caucus of migrant women tried to  address the exploitative situation of  migrant workers worldwide. Nowhere  in the Platform for Action are migrant  workers' rightsexplidtly outlined. Over  57 groups—mostly women of colour  working with migrant workers in the  North and South—tried to bring the  concerns of migrant workers into the  document.  A sub-group of the migrant women's caucus examined specifically the  section of the Platform for Action dealing with violence against women. The  caucus issued a statement stressing the  necessity of including migrant workers'  concerns into that section [see box].  The severity of situation for migrant  workers washighlightedduringtheNew  York PrepCom by the execution in Sin-r  gapore of Flor Contemplacion, a Filipina  domestic worker. Contemplacion was  hanged on March 17—in the midst of the  PrepCom meetings—for the killing of  another Filipina domestic worker, Delia  Maga, and the young boy Maga was  caring for. Many believe that  Contemplacion was innocentfseeKinesis  April and May 1995].  In the days before Contemplacion's  hanging, the migrant women's caucus  launched a flurry of actions to stop the  execution. Thecaucus called on the Chair  of the Commission of the Status of  Women, Patricia Licuanan, to demand  at the official government meeting that  Singapore stay the execution.  Hours before Contemplacion's  hanging was scheduled, NGO groups  picketed for the stay. Licuanan, who is  also from the Philippines, read a statement before the general assembly of UN  members expressinggrave concern over  the Contemplacion's scheduled execution, and called for a minute of silence.  Fely Villasin, who also works with  the Toronto domestic workers' rights  organization INTERCEDE,saysthatthe  execution highlights the exploitation of  migrant workers, and that it must be  stopped. "The hanging of Flor  Contemplacion brings to sharp focus  theday-to-day violation of fundamental  human and labour rights of migrant  women, particularly domestic workers,  who leave family and friends behind in  search of employment abroad," says  Villasin..  Even though women at the New  York PrepCom put in a lot of work  amending the Platform for Action,  Villasin says there still is a lot more work  to be done in Beijing, as almost 40 percent of Platform is bracketed. [Areas  bracketed are those that are still open to  challenge by any of the world governments.] The bracketed sections will need  to be discussed and ratified at the government forum in Beijing.  As Kinesis goes to press, the revised  Platform for Action was still not available. Stay tuned...

JUNE 1995 Feature  Vanaja Dhruvarajan:  Changing the university:  context and content  by Vanaja Dhruvarajan, as told to  Gomi Puri   Vanaja Dhruvarajan is a first generation Indo-Canadian woman. Currently, she  is the 1994-1995 Ruth Wynn Woodward  professor of 'women's studies at S imon Fraser  University in Burnaby, BC. Since 1973,  Dhruvarajan has been teaching sociology at  the University of Winnipeg. She obtained  her Ph.D at the University of Chicago.  Dhruvarajan has writtenabook, Hindu  Women and the Power of Ideology [published by Bergin and Garvey, Massachussets,  1989, and in paperback by Vistaar Publications, Delhi, India 1989], as well as numerous articles on Indo-Canadian women.  Dhruvarajan organized a one-day conference, Bridging the Race and Gender  Gap, held in May at Simon Fraser University, Harbour Centre campus. The objective  ofthe conferencewas to bringtogetherwomen  from the university and activist communities—and in particular, women of colour  from those communities—to discuss issues  such as racism, sexism, poverty, violence  and occupational and educational opportunities.  Gomi Puri: As the current incumbent of the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Chair at Simon Fraser University, what special focus are you faying to  bring to the teaching of women's studies?  Vanaja Dhruvarajan: One of the reasons for the five endowed Chairs across  Canada was the bridge the gap between  universities and the community. Women's studies itself developed as the result of grassroots women's movements,  and is often considered to be the aca-  demicarm of grassroots women'smove-  ments. The idea is to keep a continuous  link between the academy and the movement itself so that both can develop from  the interaction.  Puri: You say there are three aspects  to your work: research, teaching and  community outreach. With regard to  research, is there a special focus to your  work this year?  Dhruvarajan: I have been involved in  doing research on Indo-Canadian  women for some time, and my work this  year is a continuation of those studies. I  have done research on first generation  Indo-Canadian women in Winnipeg. I  have also collected data on second generation Indo-Canadian women, and  during this year will be writing up the  findings of that study.  Puri: When we look at the position  of South Asian women in Canadian society, the social location of South Asian  women here and now, it appears to be a  continuation of the colonial exploitation  that has characterized our history for  much of the past two centuries. Do you  agree with this analysis?  Dhruvarajan: By and large, yes. The  colonial heritage has impacted on the  position of South Asian women. Immi  gration policies have generally been racist. Their preference has been for able-  bodied men. Women have mostly immigrated under family class, with the expectation of being looked after by their  menfolk.  Often that does not work out, and  then women find they do not qualify for  many social services like language training, et cetera. So, they are forced to take  up jobs in the lowest [paid and most  exploited] rungs of the labour force.  There were exceptions to this in the late  60s and early 70s when there was a  shortage of professionals. [Some] South  Asian women were able to [get] professional jobs because of the difficulty of  finding European immigrants to fill these  positions. .  So there is a kind of bi-modal distribution with [South Asian] women in the  highest as well as the lowest categories  of the employment market. Women in  both these categories suffer; the ones in  professional fields often cannot find jobs  commensurate with their training because training from other countries is  considered by universities and professional associations as inferior. Women  in the lowest levels of employment face  the worst conditions. So the colonial  heritage does affect both.  Puri: What has been your experience in trying to bring change to the  university context?  Dhruvarajan: Part of the mandate of  this Chair is to teach two courses. I  taught a course on women of colour in  the first term, and one on Indo-Canadian women during the second term. I  have faced some difficulty convincing  whitestudentsofthesignificanceofwhite  privilege, but by and large the courses  have been well received.  There are many ways to deal with  systemic racism: through changing the  university curriculum to become more  inclusive, respecting differences and  accepting differences, having more  women of colour teaching these courses,  and consciously trying to raise awareness in the larger society.  Puri: Could you talk about the content of your courses, and about the reaction of the university population to your  courses?  Dhruvarajan: I wanted to bring in the  perspective of women of colour [into the  courses] to make the material more inclusive, to bring the margin to the centre,  as [African American writer and academic] bell hooks puts it. In addressing  the issues from the perspective of women  of colour, I wanted to explore ways in  which [our] issues could be addressed.  I did this in several ways. Many of  my students were white women. One  method was to ask each student to [categorize] herself according to gender,  class, race, and ethnicity, make an analy-  Photo courtesy of Vanaja Dhruvarajan  sis of her own life experiences, and then  compare [her experience] to [the experiences] of women of colour [they inter-  viewedJ.The idea was to help [the white  students] understand they have race and  class privilege. Although some of the  women of colour have class privilege,  they do not have race privilege. The idea  is to understand the intersection of all  these factors.  We also analyzed many of the articles written by women of colour about  women of colour, and discussed possible solutions for the problems women of  colour face in Canadian society, such as  racism, being treated as "outsiders", job  discrimination. Many [white] women  said they had gained a whole new perspective.  There seems to be a great deal of  interest in the [women's studies] department to continue teaching a course  on women of colour, to be more inclusive and responsive to the needs expressed by women of colour.  With regard to the course on Indo-  Canadian women, there is not much  written information [on or by Indo-Canadian women]. Almost all women in  the course were Indo-Canadian women,  so part of the course was having them  look at their life experiences as Indo-  Canadians.  The Indo-Canadian women [in my  class] were not only concerned about  racism in the larger society, but about  the class and caste conflicts in their own  community, as well as issues such as  dowry, sex selection, et cetera.  Puri: Have you had the opportunity  to go out into the larger community, and  bring the issues of women of colour to  them?  Dhruvarajan: One of the exciting  things about my work this year has been  the opportunity to meet many groups—  both of white and of South Asian women.  I particularly remember one instance  [when] I spoke at a meeting about the  global and national issues of women of  colour and of their views on these issues.  One older white woman came up and  said that her perspective on these issues  had changed completely, and she had  acquired a new dimension to her thinking and analysis.  At another meeting I spoke of the  issues of racism and sexism surrounding the sex selection issue [and] the South  Asian community, and the treatment of  the issue by the media as a "cultural"  phenomenon. I pointed out that it was  an issueof power,not culture. I drew the  parallel of the issue of date rape that  happens so frequently in Canadian society and pointed out that a person from a  foreign country, coming in, would see  this as a cultural phenomenon rather  than the power issue that it is. Seeing the  light go on when the issue was explained  in that way was a very satisfying experience!  Gomi Puri is an Indo-Canadian woman  who lives in Vancouver.

June 12  1938 Commercial Drive  tel: 255-9559 fax: 253-3073  Office Supplies    •    Art Supplies  — Feature  UNESCO International Symposium on Women and the Media:  Mystifying the  demystifying of media  by Fatima Jaffer  I'd never been to a conference organized by a gigantic, famed international body such as the United Nations  or any of its "bodies." I didn't know  what to expect when Kinesis decided to  send me to report on and participate (in  the limited capacity of "gatecrasher") in  the International Symposium on Women  and the Media. I knew other women had  survived (and lived to tell the tale of)  other United Nations conferences, such  as 1985's World Conference on Women  in Nairobi.  The symposium, which took place  at the Toronto Hilton in March, was  organized by the Canadian Commission  of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).  I imagined a large room filled with  men and women "experts," artists, filmmakers and other cultural producers,  and a smattering ot women from grassroots organizations from all over the  world. I imagined day-long formal presentations, peoplechecking IDs, and male  security types wearing suits. I expected  women from Ms. Magazine (the US),  Herizons (Winnipeg) and other feminist  media to be there.  I also imagined that a roomful of  women working in media production  would lead to heated discussions on  world politics, such as the rise of the  religious (and non-religious) Right, the  fall of the Berlin Wall, the emergence of  "Islamic fundamentalism" as the new  "Red threat," and the devastating impact of global economic restructuring on  women worldwide. I expected debate  between women of different political,  economic, racial and geographical backgrounds. I expected to see women of  colour and Aboriginal women from the  "First World" at the symposium—very  few were.  "Talking-head" panels tookupmost  of the four-day symposium. There were  some feminists and a (smaller than I had  expected) smattering of women from  grassroots organizations. There were  only a handful of men. But there was  little heated debate and discussion, and  limited acknowledgement of the economic and political contexts in which  women live, both in the so-called First or  Third Worlds. And in fact, Kinesis was  the only Canadian feminist publication  present. Still, no one checked my ID.  The Toronto symposium was a long  time in the making. In 1975, whenwomen  from around the world met at the NGO  forum of the 1st UN World Conference  on Women in Copenhagen, they fought  for acknowledgement of the fundamental importance of the relation between  wotnen vsinc  to emcT cmmi  By the second day  of the symposium,  many of the women  attending had begun to  express dissatisfaction  with the formal  structure...there was no  room for discussion  between women  of the issues raised  (or not raised) during  the presentations.  women and communications. Twenty  years later, the 4th UN World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in  September, will put the issue of women  and "communication in the service of  humanity" on the official agenda for the  first time.  It was to this end that about 150  women gathered in Toronto. The symposium, subtitled Access to Decision Making and Expression, was organized over a  two-year period. It was UNESCO's  prime contribution to a series of international conferences that have taken place  in preparation for the Beijing conference.  The conference began with welcoming speeches by Canada's Status of  Women minister Sheila Finestone, and  Gertrude Mongella, the Secretary General of the 4th UN World Conference on  Women. Finestone spoke the morning  after the Liberal government's federal  budget was announced. The budget saw  massive cuts and sweeping changes to  Canada's social security system, which  will most devastatingly affect Canadian  women. Finestone made no reference to  the budget and its effect on women's  equality in Canada, nor to the rise of the  Right in Canada. Her speech focused  instead on the role and representation of  Canadian women in mainstream media,  minus the context and realities of most  women's lives in Canada today.  In fact, mainstream media and women's place within it formed much of the  content of panel presentations at the  symposium. Presentations ranged from  "Progress in Canada towards women's  : CHM-WEMCE THE  StM/V To &<ve WO  HEATER    WCES  equality in the media" by Women's Tel-  evision Network president Linda  Rankin; Palestinian journalist Ruba  Husari's "A journalist between war and  peace;" CNN senior vice-president Gail  Evans' "Women in an internationalnews  station;" Bettina Peters of the International Federation of Journalists' "Value  and limits of a self-regulatory approach  to gender in the media;" to "The definition of news," by New Zealand's Shona  Geary, Zimbabwe's Patricia Made, and  Fiji's Vasiti Waqa.  While some participants and observers from countries other than Canada  did represent women's alternative media organizations, there were few of  them. The Canadian participants included mostly women—many of them  feminists—from mainstream media organizations such as the National Film  Board, Women's Television Network,  National Arts Centre, the Canadian  Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian  Broadcast Standards Council, and The  Calgary Herald. Exceptions were independent Aboriginal filmmaker Loretta  Todd [see interview, page 12] and  Mediawatch founder Sylvia Spring.  Many of the participants pointed  out that they did not consider themselves feminists. Some identified women's increasing buying power and not  women's equality as the catalyst for the  women-targetted media services they  create or work for.  During debate sessions, some of the  observers pointed out that while much  time was spent talking about "riding the  back of the tiger "(mainstream media),"  there was almost no discussion about  "the tiger" itself.  Concerns raised included: the need  to look at alternative forms of media and  cultural production; whoownsand profits from media production; the differences between women in the South and  in the North; the identification of male-  centred media as North-centred media;  and whether the number of women in  mainstream media in itself could affect  social change irrespective of where these  women placed themselves politically,  or whether they had any commitment to  social change.  By the second day of the symposium, many of the womenattendinghad  begun to express dissatisfaction with  the formal structure. Although half an  hour was structured in at the end of  plenaries and panels for "debate," it  wasn't enough and there was no room  for discussion between women of the  issues raised (or not raised) during the  presentations.  Ad hoc caucuses were formed.  Women working in alternative media,  lesbians, francophone women, and other  groupsheld discussions outside the central plenary space. Perhaps the biggest  concern expressed was the lack of time  given to directly address and collectively amend the Toronto Platform of  Action—the document containing critical areas of concern and recommendations for actions and objectives to promote access to media, decision-making  and expression for women worldwide.  The Toronto Platform had been developed over a two year period, initially  continued on page 14 <OcB<^   222 c^  as told to Fatima Jaffer  Loretta Todd is Aboriginal filmmaker whose work includes, Learning Path (National Film Board, 1991) and  Hands of History (NFB 1994). She is also a writer on  cultural issues.  Loretta Todd attended the International Women and the  Media Symposium in Toronto last March asa participant.  She was the only Aboriginal woman from Canada invited to  the conference as a participant. The symposium was one of  the regional meetings held in preparation for the 4th World  Conference on Women, and was organized by UNESCO (the  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).  Kinesis spoke to Loretta Todd in Vancouver, where she  lives.  Fatima Jaffer: Could you talk about why you decided to attend the Symposium?  Loretta Todd: I felt I would be able to dialogue with  women in the media from around the world. I was  originally asked, as a participant, to facilitate a workshop. I assumed it would be a workshop with dialogue, and that that dialogue would then shape the  document that would eventually go to the World  Conference on Women in Beijing.  I had never been to a UNESCO or UN conference,  so I had no idea what to expect. I felt I could contribute  something based on my experience with Aboriginal  film and video in Canada, as an independent filmmaker, and that I could bring some of the discussion  that has been going on around women, the media and  the Aboriginal community.  Jaffer. Among concerns raised at the conference  was the lack of time given to debate and discussion  between women. As well, there was little space for  discussion Of the Toronto Platform for Action, the  document we were supposedly there to influence and  debate. [The UNESCO Toronto Platform for Action  contains concerns and recommendations on women's  expression through, decision-making in and access to  media. Seepage 14.]  Todd: I certainly felt at a bit of a disadvantage not  having understood the process leading up to the creation of the Toronto Platform. At first, I thought I'd do  the polite thing and just listen and maybe get an idea of  how the symposium would work. I brought things up,  hoping there would eventually be a place to discuss  them.  Finally, I realized there wasn't a place. There  seemed to be a misunderstanding between the organizers and the participants and observers. The organizers seemed to believe that enough discussion had gone  on at earlier meetings, while most of the participants  and observers wanted to give input in Toronto. The  Toronto Platform had been already drafted and there  seemed to be confusion among the women I talked to  about our role.  I also couldn't really embrace what was contained  in the Toronto Platform because there hadn't been any  consultation with Aboriginal women—not just in  Canada but in the world. Also, the document didn't  address issues of whose media it is...  Jaffer: ...nor who profits from it.  Todd: Yes. There seemed to be an assumption that  One woman actually said  that it's a given, the more women  we get in positions of power,  the greater our chances of  seeing changes in the media.  But look at the media in the  world—they're multinational,  owned by fewer and fewer  people, and have blatant.  right-wing agendas.  What kind of agenda are  we going to be able to advance  within these media?  there is a mass media you have to plug into, as opposed  to choosing to influence mass media or choosing to  create your own media. There was little space at the  symposium to look at creating your own media, the  advantages and successes in doing so, or even the  advantages of working within the mass media and  asserting different strategies from within.  Jaffer: Certainly the picture most people attending  the Symposium got was that most women in Canada  want to go alOng with this mass media agenda...  Todd: ...and have actually been fairly successful at  going along with that agenda. Claire Prieto from the  National Film Board and I were both approached by  women fromnon-European and North Americancoun-  tries and asked whether it was true that it was so good  in Canada. We were the only ones who ruptured this  picture of how good it is here.  Jaffer: In fact, Status of Women minister Sheila  Finestone opened up the whole symposium with this  very unreal and positive view of what's happening in  Canada...  Todd: ...when only hours before, her government  announced significant cuts to cultural production in  Canada and to programs for women. It's a dangerous  kind of hypocrisy because Canada holds itself up to the  rest of the world as a leader of human, women's and  Aboriginal rights, while at the same time carries out its  already well-prescribed agenda to erode these rights.  It was also dangerous because when [Claire and I]  spoke up, there was a sense we were just these whining  women who obviously, weren't living up to the great  ideals of this country and who weren't grateful for all  we have in Canada—not that there is racism, sexism,  homophobia or colonialism in Canada.  For that matter, [that was the same reaction to] the  concerns raised by women of colour in Canada.  Jaffer: What issues did you want to see being put on  the table for discussion?  Todd: A group of women from the Pacific region  mentioned the Women Empowering Communications  conference held in Bangkok last year. One of^the  recommendations made at that conference was about  the role of Indigenous forms of communication in the  media. I was hoping that, if there was to be a discussion  about Aboriginal rights, there would be discussion on  the right to culture and language, and ways of exchanging culture and language thrOugh the media.  TheCanadianccmstitutionrecognizes[thoserights],  and the UN recognizes various issues around culture.  These rights are set in writing to supposedly prevent  cultural genocide. Theoretically then, there should be  the same recognition for Aboriginal media as for mainstream media. I really believed there would space to  discuss, reinforce, and acknowledge those rights.  Another concern I had was that there is still systemic racism in the media in Canada. The media has  made some improvements for women, but statistically, there hasn't been a corresponding increase in  people of colour, women of colour, or Aboriginal  women or men working in the mainstream media.  [Women at the symposium] did talk about access—  putting guidelines into newsrooms, media practices  and so on. Well, there are guidelines in Canada but they  don't work.  The way^the symposium organizers] were looking at media, you felt like you were at the 'World Bank'  of media, that mass media is inevitable and there's no  way to resist it, that it is essentially a necessary practice  in every country, and if we accept it and if [those in  control of the media say they'll] put guidelines in, we'll  be protected.  Another thing I would like to have seen was  acknowledgementofthegood things peoplehave been  doing within alternative media. For example, TBNC  television broadcasting station in northern Canada has  been essential in preserving Native languages. National broadcasting networks across the norm for Indigenous people have remarkable facilities and they  do remarkable stuff—everything from talk shows to  carpentry shows, high-school equivalency shows to  children's shows—sometimes in English, sometimes  in traditional languages.  If WTN (the Women's Television Network) can be  held up as an example of success for women in Canada,  then TBNC should beheld up as the success of Indigeous  people. The National Film Board, Studio D [the division of the NFB which produces many films by women]  and the CBC [Canada's national public radio and television broadcasting system] keep getting touted as  great successes. Again, where is TBNC? And what  about the co-ops and collectives and other alternative  media where we have seen different voices having  somewhat increased access. This symposium could  have been a place of commonality and convergence  where we could talk about all our success stories.  Most of the women attending the symposium primarily work within mainstream media. There were a  few women who had created alternatives but there was  really no place for these women to talk because [the  symposium was a place] to talk about how you work in  these mass media environments and how you get  employment equity within those environments. The  myth is that, as soon as you get to those positions of  power, everything will be fine.  Jaffer: As in other sectors, when a handful of women  get into management or top positions, it is considered  a success for all women, even though it doesn't fundamentally change anything for women.  Todd: That assumption was never challenged. One  woman actually said that it's a given, the more women  we get in positions of power, the greater our chances of  seeing changes in the media. But look at the media in the  world—they're multinational, owned by fewer and  fewer people, and have blatant right-wing agendas.  What kind of agenda are we going to [be able] to  advance within these media? How much would we  have to mirror the kind of news and the kind of  perpetuation of the status quo in order to be able to  advance within those companies? There was no challenge of the threat trans-national mass media holds for  people, yet we're talking about cultural genocide of  peoples, wherever they are.  Jaffer: The representative from CNN opened her  speech with a comment that 500 years ago, Christopher  Columbus embarked on "a voyage of discovery," and  500 years later, CNN is embarking on a new voyage of  discovery. She was challenged by a woman from India  who said, what is a voyage of discovery for CNN is  actually a voyage of conquest of people in most parts of  the world.  Todd: And one woman from Switzerland pointed  out that during the Gulf War, CNN ran around Europe  selling access to their coverage of the war, basically  saying, "take this and we'll give you more." She added  that before you know it, you've atrophied your local  news production and are relying on CNN, which is  many thousands of miles away, to tell you what's  important in your city, in your town, in your country.  She said, fortunately, her news [department] rejected CNN. But many places haven't. Again there was  no discussion about the imperialism of CNN. It's an  issue that should have been addressed. I felt really  strangebecausetherewere all these women who weren't  addressing how to get ownership over news that is  made in their land. I find it strange  how the practice of capitalism is now  restricted to multinationals, that the  opportunity to have control over day-  to-day commerce—including the  media—within your own land is  being increasingly, restricted. I  have no problems with commerce and media interacting because media costs money, but  increasingly, communities and  individuals are losing control over their commerce  and media.  Atanother conference  I went to, people were saying how capitalism's  dead—what we're really  going into is a sort of feudalism.  Jaffer: I'd say that's an  obvious evolution of capitalism, not separate from  capitalism.  Todd: Yes^ you could call it white capitalism or  whatever; it is inevitable. There was an idealism among  women at the symposium, even if some of them were  afraid to speak out. I believe some journalists do take  on the responsibility of writing about human rights  and so on. Yet there seemed to be no questioning of  what effect free trade and multinational corporate  agendas have on the basic exchange of information on  our own lands and between our own people.  Increasingly, the news is just becoming an opiate,  as opposed to [being] what it has the potential to do,  which is to inspire and to reveal injustice. What about  cultural production about who you are as a people,  who you are as a woman? The space for that is becoming more and more restricted.  Jaffer:At one point, the agenda of the symposium  did change and participants finally got to discuss  amendments to the Toronto Platform for Action. You  spoke at that session, but again there was no discussion  permitted and you walked out. Could you talk about  what happened there?  Todd: Theorganizershadinitiallyleftoutany space  for a working session where we could talk face-to-face  about the Platform and say whether it reflected what  we felt it needed to reflect. [The organizers] had filled  the agenda fairly compactly so there were presentations going on every minute.  As you know, a group of us got together and said,  "This isn't working." There were a lot of different  suggestions, from "We should just leave," to "We  should go out of the regular meeting room and hold  our own meeting." Eventually, the organizers agreed  to provide half a day for a working session so we could  actually talk about the Platform. But I felt frustrated at  that session because I still couldn't break through.  Jaffer: I think that was the general feeling in the  room. We were standing up, making suggestions for  changes, pointing out things, but then being shut down  yet again.  Todd: I finally decided that, Since I had asked many  times for things to be discussed, and since there had  been no space to do that, I couldn't stay. I had asked if  there had been any formal consultation with Aboriginal women in Canada, or for that matter in North  America. They said UNESCO had been in dialogue  about the Beijing conference with Native women's  organizations in Canada, but not specifically about the  media.  They also told me they'd been in dialogue with an  Aboriginal woman about Beijing, but they hadn't had  any feedback for a year and a half. They also told me  how there had been women from Canada who'd attended earlier meetings leading up to this Toronto  symposium, and that Canada had concentrated primarily on talking about women and the media and  about violence, so they felt there had been enough  input from Canada.  So with all of those things, I just didn't feel prepared to endorse the process. If I did, I would be  irresponsible to the things that have been going on in  Canada, the things the World Alliance of Indigenous  Film and Video makers has been doing. So I left.  Jaffer: Later you came back.  Todd: I talked to some Aboriginal women in Toronto who were at a meeting of the Aboriginal Film and  Video Arts Alliance, including Maria Campbell and  Alanis Obomsawin, and said, "What shall we do? Here  we were again in the same old position—cast as radicals when all we were doing was talking about things  in our lives." They encouraged me to go back, but with  the idea that we would write up our own recommendations following the symposium to be discussed at  the final preparatory meeting for Beijing being held in  New York later in March.  Iwroteuptherecommendations,buthaven'theard  anything since from UNESCO. It's a risk participating  in this kind of process. Do you end up being an  addendum or do you end up being incorporated into  the regular stuff? Feature

involving input from women attending
seven regional world conferences on
women and the media in 1994 sponsored by UNESCO. Between seven and
40 women attended each regional conference. This information was then taken
to two meetings in Paris last December,
where the draft Toronto Platform for
Action was prepared for final ratification by the participants at the Toronto
symposium.
TheToronto Platform includes paragraphs on media and communications
issues that are to be included into the
overall Platform for Action to be discussed by world governments at the
Beijing conference. It also comprises
proposals for actions and objectives
targetted at mainstream media enterprises and associations, international and
national non-governmental organizations, educational and training institutions, and international and national
governmental organizations.
As a result of the caucusing at the
Toronto symposium, women successfully lobbied the UNESCO organizers to
change the agenda of the last two days,
to enable participants and observers to
directly address the draft Toronto Platform.
At a three-hour session provided
for this purpose, the Canadian women
of colour observers and Aboriginal filmmaker Loretta Todd pointed out the lack
of recognition of "Third World" women
within First World countries, and the
need to encourage and support non-
traditional media.
Several women from Asian, Latin
American, Caribbean and African countries pointed out the need to recognize
and challenge the imperialist and capitalist   nature of most Western main-
stream media institutions and \5-?\«"*/
new information technologies
such as the television conglomerate CNN and the information superhighway
systems.
Others called for the recognition of women's media networks worldwide, and the rights
of all women to have access to
expression and participation in
the media, in particular women
with disabilities, women of colour, Indigenous women __
and women of diverse     w^k \M  jF
sexual orientation.     /t0 ^^
Although the time
spentdiscussingamend-
ments to the Toronto Platform was still seen to be
insufficient and tight deadlines for written amendments were enforced due to
the limited time, over 600 written and spoken amendments
were incorporated into the final
draft of the Toronto Platform, substantially altering its nature and
form.
The final draft has since been
taken to a conference of the UN
Commission on the Status of
Women in New York, held later in
March, for inclusion into the documents being prepared for the
Beijing conference.
Kinesis has not yet
heard whether the;
amended wording
was in fact incorporated intothe Beijing
Platform for Action.
A follow-up meeting
of the Toronto symposium
and the Beijing conference is
being planned by UNESCO to
take place in 1996.

born South Asian feminist
living in Vancouver. She

- - ■ Arts  Talking with De Poonani Posse:  Flowing with Da Juice  by E. Centime Zeleke  De Poonani Posse is a collective of three  Black lesbians of West-Indian descent—  Nicole Redman, Tonia Bryan and Sherece  Taffe. They live in Toronto.  They see themselves as media activists  who are trying to shake up stereotypical  images of Black lesbians. De Poonani Posse's  major project is starting up Canada's first  Black lesbian magazine, Da Juice. Their first  issue will be published as the winter issue of  Fireweed:afeministquarterly.DcPooMflnt  Posse also take it upon themselves to grab  open mike wherever possible and to plaster  their propaganda sheets—aimed at Black  straight men, women and Black dykes and  fags—in the neighbourhoods of Toronto.  Kinesis had the opportunity to speak  with two members ofDe Poonani Posse last  month.  Centime Zeleke: The word poonani is  a West-Indian colloquialism that can be  roughly translated into pussy. Why did  you choose the name and what does it  mean for you?  DePoonaniPosse: Yes, poonani can be  translated into pussy, and as lesbians we  do like poonani and we like our own  poonani. So the name is about women  loving themselves, loving their sexual  selves. Poonani isalsoone of those words  that a lot of people use but do not really  know the meaning of—so for us it was a  way of taking the word back.  We also chose the name because it  does resonate with West-Indianess and  Africaness. When we talk about women  loving themselves, we are talking about  a very specific kind of reality, a Black  lesbian reality. This is the context we are  trying to work in. To just define ourselves as women and to be talking about  the earth goddess is fine, but we are Black  lesbians and we are fierce and bold face.  This is the way we talk to each other,  straight up.  Utilizing a language and speaking in  a way that is familiar to us translates into .  a way of being that is familiar to us. We  have gotten some flack from white people and curiosity and confusion from  non-white people about this word,  poonani. I think there is a lot of surprise  when people discover that Black people  who have been so totally colonized in the  diaspora have words amongst ourselves  that they do not know. They are shocked,  they thought it was all exposed; it's threatening and we like that.  Centime: Can you talk about your  work producing the magazine, Da Juice?  De Poonani Posse: Well we are trying  to create a Black dyke magazine that  covers the many facets of Black lesbian  life—meaning there is no one Black lesbian. We want to shake up some things.  We do not necessarily want to be about  toeing the party line—and there isa party  line. There are certain politics, hairstyles,  modes of clothing and certain modes of  sexual expression that are  acceptable. We do not really buy the party line and  we realize that most of the  Blacklesbians we talk with  and interact with are not  buying it either. /  Da Juice is trying to say     jjjjil  there are many ways of  expressing one's self. This  is why in our policy of submissions we say we are  looking for everything  JSjjf  from collages, artwork,     §  hairstyles, recipes, love letters to lust letters.  Centime: I know there has been a lot  of problems with lesbians from the  African continent—say Ethiopia or Somalia—haying cultural differences with  West-Indian lesbians. I am wondering  how you intend to avoid creating a  monolithic Black lesbian?  De Poonani Posse: This is something  that often comes up in conversations  De Poonani Posse. Photo by Grace Channer.  for people who are willing to question  and say what needs to be said.  When we talkabout identity, we can  be talking about anything. It could be  about race, about women who see themselves as being "of colour" or diasporic  or African, or it could be about lesbians  who see themselves as being into vanilla  sex or S.M. or who sleep with men.  Our experiences as three Black lesbians  have been different in that we have an  understanding of where our alliances  need to be. Having a shared sexuality  is really not enough.  amongst ourselves. We really feel the  need to express who we are in all the  different ways we can. We don't want  the magazine to contribute to an atmosphere of narrowness, where there  are only a few possible variations on  being. We are realizing that there is a  lot of exotification of African women  by women from the diaspora, where if  you say you are from Africa there are  automatically all sorts of associations  that go through people's heads.  A lot of that has to do with the fact  that we've gone through the experience of slavery, and [we] have to look  back [to Africa] and hope there is something better. We in the diaspora also  need to realize that African women are  real women who are not frozen in time.  They have their real lives and identities.  Centime: The first issue of Da Juice  is going to be about identity. Why did  you choose-this as a theme?  De Poonani Posse: We chose identity because we wanted to open up  what it means to be a Black lesbian. We  want to say that there is no hegemonic  Black lesbian identity. We are looking  Choosing identity as a theme will help  us lay down the framework of the magazine as inclusive.  Centime: The first issue of Da Juice  will be a guest editorship of Fireweed.  How did this happen, and what kind of  funding do you expect to get in order to  sustain Da Juice?  De Poonani Posse. So far we have  obtained small funding from the Ontario gay and lesbian appeal grant. With  Fireweed, we approached them with a  proposal to guest edit because in the  wholehjstory of Fireiveed there hasnever  been a Black lesbian issue or a Black  women's issue. For us it was a way to  take something like Fireweed and make it  our own at least for a small time. We  want to use this issue of Fireweed as a  jump off point.  We have a lot of heart, marvelous  politics, good writing and artistic skills,  but in the area of distribution, circulation and other technical aspects of a  magazine we are weak. This is a very  hands on approach to putting our magazine out there.  Centime: Sometimes when I think  about media, I think we need to create  more alternative media that do not rep-  licatehierarchical power structures. But  there is another part of me that thinks we  need to infiltrate already established  forums so we do not further marginalize  ourselves, but then I think we often just  end up being tokens.  De Poonani Posse: Well we think it is  possible to do both. What is always  preferable for us—and also what seems  to work for Black people—is when we  do create our own [media]. We see examples of this in Sister Vision Press [the  only Black women and women of colour  publishing house in Canada] and other  small scale businesses.  In cynical times, we think you're just  bound for failure when you try to work  within a Euro-centric model, for the results usually do not pay for the time and  frustration. However, the reality is that  they [established media] have the money  and the resources.  Centime: What kind of alliances do  you have or imagine having with the  straight Black community or with gay  Black men whose media often serves to  silence lesbian voices?     Ijgjllp  De Poonani Posse: As Black lesbians  we participate in the Black community  in general. There is a need for more  outward activism on the part of Black  lesbians and gay people saying we are  out there. Our world is not the white  lesbian and gay world. Many Black lesbian and gay people embrace the white  lesbian and gay world when they come  out. This is often because of homophobia  in the [Black] community or their situation at home. But our experiences as  three Black lesbians have been different  in that we have an understanding of  where our alliances need to be. Having  a shared sexuality is really not enough.  De Poonani Posse is still accepting submissions for their first issue of Da Juice. All  submissions should be typed or neatly written, double spaced, and include a SASE and  bio. Send submissions to Da Juice, PO Box  156, Stn P, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2S7.  Deadline is July 15. . vi£      E. Centime Zeleke is an Ethiopian femme  with an axe. Arts  Interview with Dionne Brand  Brandishing a  powerful pen  as told to Charmaine Perkins and  Sandra McPherson   Dionne Brand is a Toronto based poet,  writer and filmmaker. She has published  several books of poetry, including No Language is Neutral, and a collection of short  stories, Sans Souci and Other Stories. As  well, several of her essays can be found in  such groundbreaking texts as Returning  the Gaze: Essays on Racism, Feminism  and Politics, edited by Himani Bannerji,  and We're Rooted Here and They Can't  Pull Us Up: Essays in African Canadian  Women's History, coordinated by Peggy  Bristow.  Brand has also written and directed  three documentary films: Older, Stronger,  , Wiser; Sisters in the Struggle and Long  Time Comin'. She is presently working on  a documentary of a conversation between her  and Adrienne Rich.  Kinesis had the opportunity to interview Dionne Brand in April when she was in  Vancouver to read from her latest collection  of essays, Bread Out of Stone recollections sex recognitions race dreaming  politics.  Charmaine Perkins: When last we  spoke, you used a powerful image to  describe one of the ways you conceptualized Bread Out ofS tone, as a work done  in ruin or out of ruin. Could you elaborate on the significance of this image?  Dionne Brand: At the time I started to  write the book, I thought about writing  in a very "popular way" about where we  were at, about living in Toronto amid  the kind of history of Black people living  in Toronto, and about the kind of nihilism which seemed to be so much a part  of our every day as Black people living  in America. I started to thinkabout writing these essays right after the "Just  Desserts" killing in Toronto. [In 1993,  three young Black men were arrested for the  shootingofayoungwhitewomanata trendy  dessert place.] The police and the media  projected these blurred images of young  Black men, and it created a kind of vilification of the Black community as a  whole.  I began to think about having grown  up during the civil rights movement,  and now seeing a lot of that Tightness of  fighting against racism or for human  and civil rights disintegrate amid a right  wing upsurge in the Americas, if not the  world. I thought about where we are  now located as people who want to  continue the fight for racial equality,  and racial justice.  I was thinking about what young  people at this time would think, in the  midst of what seemed to me was ruin, in  the midst of a great right wing upsurge  that wants to drive back the gains of  social justice continually, everyday.  That's the place Bread Out of Stone is  coming from.  I also didn't feel there was any  popular articulation of the life of Black  folk or progressive folk in thiscountry at  this moment. I wanted to write that  down; I wanted to contribute to that.  Perkins: I see revolution as a constant theme in your book. What does it  mean, given that it's not a romantic or  nostalgic sensibility, but that there's a  necessity to work toward revolution, to  work out of this sort of nihilism?  At your reading, you talked about  freedom from all kinds of oppressive  power structures.  Brand: Because nihilism is such closure, I think it is precisely the point at  which one sees the possibility of regenerating a revolutionary vision, [especially] when things look as grim as they  do for Black people in America—and I  am including Canada in this notion of  America.  I think what we are seeing is a new  fascism. More recently, we see the presence of so many right wing militias,  which threaten any forms of social justice that progressive people on this continent have been able to win. A lot of  Charmaine Perkins and Dionne Brand.  white men are talking about how these  gains in social justice disenfranchise  them—it's happened around employment equity issues in Ontario where  there's a been a major outcry against  employment equity because suddenly  white men "can't get jobs." White men  see social justice as anathema to their  existence, and I think that's really frightening.  Perkins: And what about the revolution?  Brand: We alsohavefhis word "revolution" matlthinkhasnowbeencoopted  by people like Newt Gingrich and the  Reform Party who talk about how "this  is a revolution." You know what they're  doing is re-establishing white  supremacist capitalist kinds of structures—and this re-establishing is seen as  revolutionary.  So I think we've seen the full gamut,  where we've seen socialist values, talk,  and consciousness being inverted over  the last 25 years or so to the point where  we are faced with a  right wing vulgar  capitalism which  seeks to take back  all those gains we  won, which seeks to  promote a philosophy where some  people lose their humanity.  I think we have  to be really extremely vigilant to  make sure—as powerful as capitalism  is—that we are not  left totally weak and  victimized by it.  We have to recover some of those  ideas we began with about social justice,  about human equality. But of course,  those ideas need a re-thinking because  there are some things about them that  didn't work. I think the philosophies we  held as socialists or communists did not  fully satisfy the rights of women or gays  and lesbians—we didn't fully explore  the nature of being human and how we  would be required to share  the work to really achieve that  revolution.  I think that  those of us on  the left need to  look deeply at  what helped  undermine our  own struggle.  This is why I  look at  Photo by Agnes Huang homophobia  and sexism in  Bread Out of Stone, and how they must  become an intrinsic part of our critique  of society. I do that for my own well  being as a woman and as a lesbian, to try  to help us think our way. out of [an  oppressive] place.  I don't think essentially that socialism and communism are dead. I think  that there are certain states that practise  the kind of state communism and state  socialism which have failed, but I think  they are fundamental ideas and  philiosophies about how human beings  ought to share the world and our labour.  Perkins: Do you have any ideas on  ways of sustaining ourselves and on the  sort of healing that must also happen at  the same time?  Brand: We may not be able in this  phase of the revolution to find ourselves  a text about the way forward—like the  Communist Manifesto [by Karl Marx and  Frederich Engels]. Maybe we are continually making these texts through the  exploration of our experiences and con  sciousness. To lookback at what we had  before may not be sufficent.  I think there is a magnificent amount  of new thinking about the way we are  living—whether it is coming from feminist writers or poets, or from gay or  lesbian writers, or from rappers...  I think we need to throw away much  of how we thought, when we find it  follows any orthodoxy. Maybe it isn't  that we are looking for the one text that  will lead us the way forward, but for the  many, many texts which open us up to  thinking about [possibilities and revolution] more and more.  When I think of all the texts that  have come together for me to describe  my experience and to think about the  future, [I come up with] so many. There  are those places and points that give you  a salve and a way forward.  In some ways, we are eager for an  end to [the way things are]. I think we  have a right to that eagerness and to that  end. But [we exist] in the face of a regime  that tells us we are wrong to want social  justice or employment equity or gay  rights or working class rights—that's all  you see on CNN, ABC, CBS, or CBC, for  that matter.  We are constantly told that [right  wing capitalism] is the major text of the  societies we live in, and it is a text that  has spread, like sheets of paper right  around the entire world. But we also  have these other texts that we merely  have to notice, even at moments when  we feel totally overwhelmed by that  power structure.  Sandra McPherson: In the second  piece you read, "Nothing of Egypt," you  said that when you were in Grenada,  you were conscious of your position of  privilege and conscious of what you  were writing. [Brand went to Grenada  during the socialist revolution in 1983.]  You also said that writing is claiming.  Brand: I find writing to be such a  powerful medium, but even in saying  that, it's only insofar as how many people are literate. Unfortunately, it's those  people [who are literate] who run the  JUNE 1995 Arts  Review of Dionne Brand's Bread Out of Stone:  A taste of possibilities  world and shape other people's lives.  Given that, I don't want to be associated  with the kind of writing that appropriates people's experience and sends it  back to them.  When I talked about writing asclaim-  ing, I meant that there is a moment when  writing is presumptuous, that there are  moments when writing is privileged  speech. I didn't want to assume a privilege above and beyond what everyone  else in Grenada was experiencing—-there  were 100,000 people on that island.  What I wanted to claim was the  particular space I occupied—which was  a privileged space, a space I could leave.  There is a guilt with being able to leave.  There is a guilt when you're not killed,  especially if you agreed philosophically  and morally with that socialist revolution—which I did.  I could, with my pen, construct or.  reconstruct that place and those events.  I always have to be very careful about  how Iconstruct a world, so what I do  have to claim is my place in it, and the  privilege L assume in it too.  I wanted to be respectful of thoseleft  behind. I know the way in which journalism and writing can appropriate all  kinds of experiences, so I just wanted to  be sure that I didn't do that. I didn't live  that experience the same way that someone there lived. So those were all my  'buts' in that passage [in "Nothing of  Egypt"]. I think it was incumbent upon  me to put them in there because I didn't  want to become this romantic figure  who had been off to a revolution—like  Hemingway.  McPherson: From that, I want to ask  about the certain level of responsibility  I'm seeing that you live with. I guess it is  bestowed upon you, as a Black lesbian  feminist writer, to continue writing.  You've been across the country with  Bread Out of Stone, you've had to put up  with interviews and ugly reviews...do  you not see it as a responsibility that you  now have to...  Brand: ...take the shit? (laughter)  McPherson: To take shit and keep  writing. Do you see yourself in a position of being some sort of model for  those of us who have not yet picked up  the pen?  Brand: The thing is, I'm not sure I  would be doing anything else anyway.  Writing is not a task in that way, it's not  a duty. I can't imagine myself not writing or not writing these things. What am  I going to do—go off and write some  nice book that all the reviewers will like  because it doesn't make anyone feel defensive or bad, or doesn't question anything, or isn't so passionate or [filled  with so much] "rage"?—a favourite  word that comes up all the time in critiques of my work.  I can't see myself doing that, as long  as I can't see myself free. If freedom  came tomorrow, I'd stop writing, (much  laughter) because there would be no  reason to keep writing.   by Charmaine Perkins  BREAD OUT OF STONE  by Dionne Brand  Coach House Press, Toronto, 1994  . In Bread Out of Stone, Dionne Brand  critiques" those systems and ideologies—  racist, sexist, homophobic and so on—  that oppress and downpress us as Black  people and as Black women. Brand  makes no apologies for recognizing those  systems that lock us into a constant and  daily struggle to make our homes and  lives here, in countries like Canada. She  makes no apologies as she names the  injustices and attempts to overstand our  place and survival in these societies:  where we are all seen as newly arrived  immigrants and as "illegals" who are a  strain on society; where Black men and  women are pathologized as criminals by  law enforcement agencies and the media; and where in Montreal young Black  children can be rounded up during  school, by police, and bribed with pizza  so that they can be placed in police lineups.  In spite of these and other examples,  we as Black people are made to feel that  these are merely isolated examples, exceptions, that draw bewildered "oohs"  from concerned faces who would like to  believe that it isn't all that bad, and that  maybe we just like to draw attention to  our plight—like a litany—to make them  feel badly. Often we are, made to feel  guilty for what we feel and see and  know—placed on the defensive and  made to explain our so-called myopia,  since we live with the reality of race:  "Why must you people turn everything  into a 'race' issue?"  So while many of us know and live  these realities, the constraints of language itself—not to mention societal  conditioning—makes the articulation of  these experiences difficult. How easy is  it to be stereotyped as the righteous  wronged, and how easy is it to fall into  romanticizing Black pain, Black strength  and courage? How then do we find a  vocabulary and a language that does  not collapse into cliche and myth-making, where we can begin that enormous  task of imagining and speaking our way  into possibility and hopefulness in this  Canadian landscape?  Given the lack of any unified front—  the 60s and 70s Black consciousness and  civil rights movement now a part of  history and memory—many of us still  long for change and justice, for some  thing better. But at the same time, this  longing and passion for change in Bread  Out of Stone becomes suspect, another  rhetoric or revolution that can be easily  dismissed by Black and white readers  alike as that romantic longing for revolution, where it becomes a nostalgic participation in something big, and you can  temporarily lose yourself in the lightness of the moment and the action.  Such is my own skepticism and cynicism given that we learn from young not  to be naive and sentimental—the world  doesn't have time for that and for us.  Even the very word has become so heavily trivialized and appropriated that it  has become another empty sign.  While Brand may be unable to point  us towards some revolutionary brick  road, she does point to the necessity of  imagining possibilities and of asking  where do we go from here? In that way,  Bread Out of Stone becomes a re-  articulaton of what that revolution is—  no longer a singular, unified event—and  she locates herself, as a Black lesbian, as  part of the struggle so that we don'thave  to live out lives "so small":  "Revolutions do not happen outside you, they happen in the vein,  they change you and you change  yourself, you wake up in the morning  changing. You say this is the human  being I want to be. You are making  yourself for the future, and you do  not even know the extent of it when  you begin but you have a hint, a taste  in your throat of the warm elixir of  ("Nothing of Egypt" page 138)  Brand does not, however, solely critique racist and sexist power structures,  she also addresses the ways in which her  lesbian identity is erased in Black communities where this identity becomes  suspect and suspicious—as if it were a  choice where one renounces one's Blackness and womanness to become that  other.  In the essays "Bread out of Stone"  and "The Body for Itself," Brand also  critiques the paradigm of the Black woman's body-often subject to male violence—as heterosexual, conforming to  male desire. What Brand deems necessary is the liberation of the Black lesbian  body to exist, without having to be careful (especially to the threat of violence),  to desire and to love. -  Brand's other esssays in this collection touch on themesofmigration,home,  belonging, or connectedness. In "Just  Rain, Bacolet," one of the more lyrical  essays, she describes her flight from  Canada to Tobago, and how "starved"  she is "for someone to call us a name we  would recognize." What Brand confronts, in this and other essays is what  she calls "the presence of history and the  ancestors," what she describes as a kind  of "racial memory."  Critics of this book have, however,  been quick to overlook it, taking issue  with Brand herself and her ingratitude  to Canada, which they feel she constructs as a site of "irreconcilable differences"—all the white people are racist,  all the men are violent, and all the  heterosexuals are oppressive. In effect,  she is dismissed as just another angry,  ungrateful Black woman, after all that  Canada has done for her.  If anything, Brand's text functions  as an "uprising textuality," a term borrowed from Carol Boyce Davies' latest  work on Black women's writing, as an  unpleasant reminder to those who take  it for granted how we must negotiate  and come to terms with this landscape  we call home, and how we find our place  in it.  Charmaine Perkins is a Trinidadian who  is also negotiating her place here.  Charmaine Perkins has contributed to  Kinesis before, and will again. Sandra  McPherson is a first time contributor.

Arts  What are all those lesbians doing in the movies?  Coming attractions  by Kathleen Oliver  Although it's barely a ripple in a very  big, very heterosexual pond, "The Lesbian"  has hit local movie houses and television  sets. Not exactly big time, but the difference  betweenabsolutelynothingandalittlesome-  thing can feel very big indeed. The movies  come in different flavours: sometimes "lesbian chic," sometimes scandal, sometimes  barely a hint, sometimes demonic possession.  Rather than a ttempt a serious review of  the many recent movies with lesbian content  (including Canada's Tokyo Cowboy, and  When Night is Falling byPatricia Rozema,  Kinesis' Kathleen Oliver listened in on an  imaginary conversation between two Vancouver lezzyfilm junkies, Castra and Pat.  Why don't we listen in...  Castra: Have you noticed that an  awful lot of lesbians seem to be turning  up in the movies these days?  Pat: Whaddya mean? We've always  had our own little subculture. There've  been lesbian movies for ages—not a lot,  but the ones you see at festivals and  stuff.  Castra: No, no, I mean mainstream  movies. The stuff you can see downtown any night of the week.  Pat: Come to think of it, yeah, there  have been quite a few...  Castra: I fir st became really aware of  the phenomena in February. In the space  of a weekl saw Heavenly Creatures, Tokyo  Cowboy, and Boys on the Side—three movies from three different countries [New  Zealand, Canada and the US respectively] that were as utterly different from  one another as could be. The only thing  they had in common was that each contained some lesbian content tucked into  the story.  Pat: And wasn't that the same week  that US network television aired The  GretheCammermeyerStory?Butit'smter-  esting: the lesbian stuff wasn't the point  of any of those films, it was just there.  Castra:Even if it was practically invisible in Boys on the Side...  Pat: Practically invisible? You mean  completely invisible!  Castra: No kidding. And in Tokyo  Cowboy the two women look so much  alike I would have kept getting them  confused except that one of them was  always grumpy and the other one was  terminally perky.  Pat: You know, I dug out my Vancouver Film Fest program after I saw  that film: there was no mention of the  lesbian content in the write-up—the girlfriend is even described as a "roommate."  Castra: What a switch from the general release—the Toyko Cowboy ad in the  papers had a picture of the two women  kissing, and a quote from the Vancouver  Sun review with the word "lesbian" in it  right above the title! Are we becoming  safe or something?  Pat: Not if you look at Heavenly  Creatures, where homosexuality is turned  into this demonic influence...  Castra: But that film is  based on a true story, and  there's no question that  psychiatry viewed homosexuality that way in the  1950s. I thought the psychiatrist was kind of a caricature, actually, the way  they had a close-up of his  sweating brow. This cari-  caturedownplayed the real  menace of that view of  sexuality and the genuine  damage it did to people's  lives.  Pat: Yeah, I guess it's  easy for us, with all the  strides that have been  made, to forget how bad  things were—still are, in  many places. Buthell, we're  all over the movies now.  Castra: Even The Brady  Bunch Movie had that delicious liftle lesbian subplot,  with Marcia's butchy  friend.  Pat: That was one 90s update that  was definitely not in the original TV  series!  Castra: Okay, so we're popping up  I everywhere, in a casual way. But what  about the latest batch of films where  we're the main attraction?  Pat: Like BarGirls, which alsdplayed  downtown...  Castra: And When Night Is Falling,  which has been getting a ton of press and  has full-page ads everywhere with this  picture of two women kissing...  Pat: Care to offer a quick plot precis  for those who might have missed it?  Castra: Sure. When Night is Falling is  the latestfromPatriciaRozema, Toronto  director of I've Heard the Mermaids Singing. Camille (Pascale Bussieres), staid  little professor at a Christian college, is  at the laundromat, mourning the sudden loss of her beloved pet dog, when  .she meets and is comforted by Petra  (Rachael Crawford), a circus performer  who deliberately switches their laundry  so she can subsequently try to seduce  Camille with the unforgettable line: "I'd  like to see you in the moonlight with  your head thrown back and your body  on fire."  Pat: Which sends Camille ranning  back into the arms of her male lover,  Martin (Henry Czerny), also a professor  at the aforementioned Christian college.  But somehow, despite their plans for  marriage and professional promotion,  she can't get the very persistent Petra  out of her mind—or her immediate surroundings.  Castra: "Fear is what you pay for  adventure," Petra tells Camille as she  drags her along on a winter hang-gliding excursion, and eventually, Camille  checks her fear long enough to have the  adventure she and Petra have been waiting for. But then, everything Camille  knows about herself is suddenly thrown  Petra (Rachael Crawford) and Camille (Pascale Bussieres) share a passionate kiss in  When Night is Falling, directed by Patricia Rozema.  into question: is the adventure a passing  fancy or the beginning of a new life?  Pat: Okay, it isn't deep, and the plot  is pretty obvious, but it's a visually gorgeous film, especially with all of the  circus business, like that unforgettable  fancy dress dance with the steam irons,  or the breathtaking work of the trapeze  artists, interspersed with Camille and  Petra's lovemaking.  Castra: Butdon'tyou think "visually  gorgeous" is a bit of a double-edged  sword? Wouldn't it be nice if, for a  change, the women in these films had  bodies or faces that didn't conform to  fashion-magazine standards of beauty?  Pat: I'm with you on that—though I  still prefer the lush sex scenes in When  Night Is Falling to the invisible love in  something like Hollywood's Boys on the  Side.  Castra: That's what happens when  men try to make movies about lesbians.  Hey, and don't you think Mary Louise  Parker, in Boys on the Side, is getting tired  of playing women in lesbian relationships who end up having a terminal  illness?  Pat: YoumeanlikeinthemovieFried  Green Tomatoes? It's true, she's starting  to get typecast or something...  Castra: Back to When Night Is Falling.  Obviously, by virtue of its being a Canadian film, it's not in the same market as  Boys on the Side, with Whoopi Goldberg  and Drew Barrymore, but that's what  saves it. I'd take When Night is Falling  and its quirky depiction, fluffy and  fraughtwithimperfections,anydayover  a Hollywood movie that suggests an  utterly implausible relationship without ever once showing it—without so  much as a peck on the cheek.  Pat: Yeah, it seems that ever since  Sandra Bernhardt came out on Roseanne,  everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon. Lesbians are trendy now.  - Castra: AndhavingMorganFairchild  cast as Sandra Bernhardt's lover was  our first clue to how confused mainstream movies and TV would be over  how to deal with this new trend. Some,  like The Brady Bunch Movie, handle it  remarkably well; others, like Boys on the  Side, fall way down.  Pat: I'm with you on preferring the  quirky productions from closer tohome.  Trends in the mainstream come and go  awfully quickly, but as long as more  lesbians are moving into the business of  making movies, we'll continue to have  fresh visions like Go Fish and WhenNight  Is Falling.  Castra: Incidentally, don't you think  it was highly remiss on the part of the  organizers of When Night Is Falling's  sneak preview not to rent a space that  the largely-dyke crowd could repair to  following the screening, to enjoy the  post-happy-ending flush in each other's  company?  Pat: Highly remiss indeed, (pause)  But at least we have each other.  Castra: (smiling) Yes. And, apparently, a lot more lesbians to look for-  ward to seeing in the movies.

V6B2N4  TEL: (604) 684.0523  VANCOUVER  WOMEN'S  BOOKSTORE  HOURS:        |®Srtl  MONDAY -SATURDAY  10AM- 6PM  18 Arts  Healing from ritual abuse:  Real memories,  true courage  by Beckylane as told to Cathy  Stonehouse   Beckylane is the pseudonym of a writer  from Turtle Island, whose first book, Where  the Rivers Join: A Personal Account of  Healing from Ritual Abuse was published  this spring by Press Gang Publishers (Vancouver, BC). Beckylane is unable to use her  real name or reveal details identifying her or  her abusers because of legal threats made by  her relatives. Where the Rivers Join weaves  journal entries and first-person memory accounts in with quotations (on the subject of  ritual abuse) from many other sources, as  well as comments from readers and friends.  White space and broken-up layout evoke  the fragmented quality of recovered memory  in a society lohich denies and disbelieves.  Where the Rivers Join is a powerful, non-  sensationalized and precise account of an  intense healing period, the work of a woman  courageously reclaiming her life.  Kinesis had the opportunity to inter-  vieiv Beckylane when she was in Vancouver  for the launching of her book.  Cathy Stonehouse: How does it feel to  go p ublic with your story asaritualabuse  survivor?  Beckylane: I feel really good about it.  I'm beginning to feel more and more  strongly about how important this is.  Stonehouse: There are so few books  out there for ritual abuse survivors, especially ones that talk about ritual abuse in  a political context. Most of the books are  either sensationalistic or written from a  clinical perspective.  Beckylane: Abookthatwas very helpful to me was Elly Danica's book, Don't:  A Woman's Word [published by Gynergy  Books, Charlottetown, PEI, 1988 and  McClelland & Stewart, Toronto, 1990]. It  was almost the only book available, now  there is another, and pretty soon there'll  be more.  Stonehouse: Addressing the so-called  false memory syndrome backlash is one  of the undercurrents of your book Where  the Rivers Join. Was this intentional from  the start?  Beckylane: It was not deliberate  throughout the whole process, but when  I was at a certain point in writing the  book. [There was] a broadcast on a national Canadian televisionnetworkabout  ritual abuse that was skeptical and really  sensationalistic. [This] really made me  angry. [The FMS backlash] comes from  systemic push towards disbelief and denial [that abuse is real].  Stonehouse. I understand you wanted  to publish under your real name but  couldn't. How has it been with that kind  of silencing?  Beckylane: It's very frustrating. In a  way it's like a repeat [of the abuse]. First  of all, [ritual abuse is] such a secret that I  repress it; then I try to talk about it but I  was not permitted to, then when I'm  ready to, lo and behold I can't.  JUNE 1995  Because of this, all I am [seen as]  for all intents and purposes is a survivor of ritual abuse, and that's really  not who I am. In many ways the richness of who I've become is completely  abseryt, I can't bring any of that into  my story.  Stonehouse: Did legal threats also  affect the content of the book?  Beckylane: Yeah, I had to take out  anything that was an indicator of who  Iam...The afterword was very affected.  Stonehouse: I think the richness of  your life still really comes through-  long text of diary enfaies...andwhenl read  through the very first draft I thought it  was too intense. I also realized it probably  wouldn't be clear to anyone who wasn't a  survivor just what ritual abuse is. I didn't  want to be the person to tell them, because  I only experienced one kind of ritual  abuse...and have learned along the way  that there are several different kinds. So I  went to the source materials I had read  and put some of those voices into the text.  Stonehouse. I think some of the juxtapositions are very effective. In the book  you describe how difficult it is to talk or  What I'm hoping for, and looking forward to, is  that other survivors will find the courage in  themselves to express their stories. Having  many versions will help make a language for  ritual abuse for both survivors and the public.  You have raised two children—how  do they feel about you having published your story?  Beckylane: My kids are both really  supportive:..The anger they have towards my perpetrators is pretty intense, but it's been wonderful for me  to have my kids as grounding people.  My past and the present [I share with  my kids] are two really different realities.  Stonehouse: I think that's an enormous triumph. At what point did the  work shift from being a journal to a  possible book?  Beckylane: I would call them more  diaries than journals because they were  not part of my writing. [The diaries]  were private notes to myself during  the therapy process. Around the same  time that my therapy ended I sent a  letter of confrontation to my dad, and  copies of mat letter to my siblings.  Then I got a letter from a lawyer representing my father saying that what  I was doing was grounds for charges  of libel...and if I published this information again—sending copies to my  siblings was considered a publication—he would be forced to file a  lawsuit against me. I took the letter  and put a note under it saying "You  think this is a publication!...just wait  and see." After that I decided how I  was going to put it all together.  Stonehouse: One thing that really  struck me about the book was the way  you lay it out visually. The use of  different voices really expresses the  experience of dissociation. Why did  you weave in so many quotations from.  other sources?  Beckylane. When I first started  putting the book together it was one  write about ritual abuse, that there almost  aren't words enough. Do you feel that  you've really described the experience, or  does it still feel unsayable?  Beckylane: In many ways I think I will  never be able to find the words. A lot of it  is because I experienced [the abuse] as a  child, and the language I had to use then  was so limited. I'm finding that even the  language I have to use now is limited,  restricted to my own experience. What  I'm hoping for, and looking forward to, is  that other survivors will find the courage  in themselves to express their stories.  Having many versions will help make a  language for ritual abuse for both survivors and the public. It's just a beginning.  Stonehouse: Do you worry about being  taken as a spokesperson for ritual abuse  survivors?  Beckylane: A little bit. It's bound to  appear that way to other people, and  maybe even to me at times. I think it's a  very complex problem. This is something  that happened to me in the past, and I'm  notinterested in makingitmy life because  I have a life. It's very difficult to speak out  publicly as a ritual abuse survivor, never  mind privately, even toyourself, and I feel  that because I'm able to I have a responsibility to [speak out]. And 111 do it until I  burn out, or it's no longer necessary, or  until there are more voices out there. There  are voices now, but just so few compared  with the number of survivors there are,  and the number of people who are going  through [ritual abuse] now. It's just mind-  boggling.  Stonehouse: What kind of support  would you like to see in society for ritual  abuse survivors? What vision do you have?  Beckylane. I'm not insulting therapists  or social science professionals, I'm not  trashing those people or the value of their  work, but in the afterword I talk about—  you use the word vision—a vision of a  team of workers working with each survivor in a setting that doesn't suggest  this person is sick or inadequate or all  those other things—healers, members  of the community, whatever people are  comfortable with, as well as some of the  more traditional social science profes-  sionals-Ican'ttalkaboutmy background,  but I know there are other ways of working through trauma that are very different from the ways we are taught by  social science.  Stonehouse: In what little literature  there is, the stereotype seems to be that  ritual abuse is a white middle-class experience. I've also heard it said that  ritual abuse is not a feminist issue. What  would you say to those kinds of perspectives?  Beckylane: First of all, I'm not from a  white middle class background, but I do  agree that ritual abuse is, more than  likely, just from my own experience and  readings, a white middle-class problem.  As far as it not being a feminist issue,  that takes me aback. I feel a bit angry,  because in all fairness to women and  children—I can only speak from my  own experience—the abuse was based  on extreme, violent ideas and practices  that were highly misogynist  I [was taught] from a very early age  that women arehateful, thatthere's nothing redeeming about being a woman, or  being a child for that matter, and children, both boys and girls, were considered female until they reached puberty.  And so to hear that ritual abuse is not a  feministissue,rdliketo hear why, what  that means and where that comes frOm.  Stonehouse: What do you think  helped you most to survive?  Beckylane. I'm not sure I can answer  that. The first thing that comes into my  head is that I repressed those experiences. Everything that has happened in  my life since that abuse has been a kind  of gift. Each time, I'm ready for whatever it is that's coming. And remembering that part of my childhood is the  biggest gift I've received. It'll be years  before I can actually work out who I am,  based on who I was. That's when the  "false memory syndrome" stuff comes  in, and the hair on the back of my neck  just stands on end. There's a reason why  people repress trauma, particularly that  kind of childhood violence. It would be  almost impossible to remain sane and  carry it with you at the same time. No-  body asks for that kind of childhood.  Cathy Stonehouse is a Vancouver writer,  whose first collection of poetry, The  Words I Know, was published last fall by  Press Gang Publishers.

One  might wonder why I continue to subscribe to a publication that originates  from Vancouver and is, for the most  part, about women's issues in British  Columbia.

For example I appreciate your review of the latest  Martin budget [Kinesis April 1995], and  articles on international issues affecting  women and I know I must continue to  receive Kinesis.  In addition, Kinesis keeps me connected tothe Vancouver Women'smove-  ment, where I grew up and came out as  a feminist and a lesbian. I appreciate the  information on the latest happenings in  Vancouver even though it is sometimes  sad.  For example, I read with sorrow  of the passing of Andree Buchanan. I  met Andree through the Gazebo Connection and remember her hard work,  along with others in the Political Action  Committee. We prepared and presented  a brief in the early 80s on inclusion of  sexual orientation in theCanadian Rights  Act. We lobbied a number of MPs and  Andree always had a sense of humour  that would disarm even the most  homophobic of them.  I will miss Andree but will never  miss a copy of Kinesis. Please keep mine  coming and keep up the good work.

Having worked for nine years as  the feminist publisher of such writers as  Lee Maracle, Makeda Silvera, Chrystos,  SKYLee,Kiss&Tell,ShaniMootoo...just  to name a few; having slogged through  years of relentless overwork and  underfunding from Canada Council (as  well as no provincial arts funding for  feminist book publishers); having  prioritized advertising our book  launches and reading events in Kinesis  over many years...  I just don't understand how Press  Gang Publishers' existence in this context can be so disregarded/  disrespected/unacknowledged by you  while you encourage readers of Kinesis  to appreciate and consider the serious  plight of our two sister feminist presses  in Toronto, Ontario—and no one at  Kinesis noticed this?!
