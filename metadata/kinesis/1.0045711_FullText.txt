Political skills  forum  Winning Women—A Political Skills Forum at the Hyatt Regency, Vancouver is a  conference on the equal participation and  representation of wmen in politics. This  non-partisan event is expected to attract  women who are considering mainstream political life either as front-line candidates or  back-room supporters.  Practical sessions are scheduled on working in all levels of government, on lobbying,  and on running and winning. Guest speakers include Margaret Mitchell, Pat Carney,  Lucie Pepin and Kim Campbell. Panelists  and participants will address such issues as:  Can you be a feminist in politics? How can  you become mediagenic?" How much access  do women have to political influence and  power and how can they get more?  Registration is $50 including lunch and  resource materials. Call Lynne Kennedy at  668-6900 for more information. To register  call Kim Rust at 681-5226.  Child poverty  action  The Child Poverty Action Committee  (CPAC), which was formed in June of this  year, is a group of women who attended the  April conference on child poverty in Vancouver and agreed to get together to do  work focused on ending child poverty.  CPAC has a three point program: make  children a priority for government action,  raise welfare rates and the minimum wage  to the poverty line, fund proper meal programs for children in schools.  CPAC is currently working on a letter  campaign, asking individuals and groups  to write letters protesting the lack of action taken by government and school boards  to provide decent food programs in the  schools.  To date the Vancouver School Board, as  only one example, is spending $1,200 per  month to feed 500 kids (there are 10,000  children on welfare in Vancouver.) This  money works out to ten cents per child per  day. The VSB has also set up a committee  on hungry kids to do more research. There  are no poor people on the committee. The  Socred government, as expected, has done  nothing.  Readers are urged to send letters to Premier Bill Vander Zalm, Legislative Buildings, Victoria, B.C., V8V 1Z8. Write your  local school board and urge action on the  problem of hunger in your school district.  For more information on CPAC call Pat  Chauncey at 435-7624 or Jean Swanson at  324-4355 in Vancouver.  Single moms  The YWCA's Ninth Annual Single Mother's Conference will take place this year  on Oct. 17 and 18 at the Vancouver Y.  Childcare for children five and under is  available but interested women are urged  to register for childcare as soon as possible  since space is limited.  Conference workshops include spirituality, relationships, adult children of alcoholics, welfare rights, self esteem, organizing single mothers and more. Both days offer a lunch and fitness program so bring exercise and swimming clothes.  Registration fee is $20 based on work income or $15 if you are low income.

KINESIS ///////////////m^^  //////////////////////^^^^^  NEWS  Postal strike  Women face  job losses  by Esther Shannon  Canada's latest post office bargaining breakdown shows women  just how far Canadian governments will go in their push for privatization, touted by many politicians as the latest economic miracle maker.  At press time Marion Pollack,  president of a Vancouver CUPW  local told Kinesis "There is no  question that we're going out, the  only question is when and how."  The fundamental issue in this  strike is Canada Post's push to privatize its operations. The Corporation intends to franchise a wide  variety of postal services in order  to develop "an efficient, profitable  and rationalized service" and "reduce costs to deliver improved services to customers." The post of  fice also has plans to raise the cost  of a first class stamp to .39 cents  within the next six months.  Canada Post began selling franchises this year for $80,000 in return for a permanent guaranteed  profit margin of 18.5 percent on all  sales made by private operators.  The post office has said it intends  to sell off 50 such franchises this  year.  CUPW argues against the costs  of the privatization plan pointing  to the loss of more than 4,200 jobs  for inside postal workers and their  replacement with part time, minimum wage jobs in the retail sector.  Added to the job losses, the union  says, will be a reduction in postal  services for many Canadians.  con't on page 7  «Hfc  COALITION W  RESPONSIBLE  HEALTW  LEGISLATION  photo by Nancy Pollak  Vancouver, Sept 26th: Lesbians, gay men and their supporters take to the streets to protest B.C.'j pending AIDS quarantine bill, aka Bill 34, Health Act amendments.

Disabled woman files discrimination complaint  by Dolores Fitzgerald  A controversy that has been festering in Vancouver for the past  six months broke open last month  when Joan Meister, a disabled  woman, laid a discrimination complaint against the Port of Vancouver and was then investigated  by the Ports Canada intelligence  unit.  The Canadian Human Rights  Commission will investigate Meis-  ter's complaint that an overpass,  intended to provide access to a  recently created beachfront park,  is so steep that it violates fed  eral laws forbidding discrimination  against disabled people.  Meister, who has multiple sclerosis and must use a wheelchair  for mobility, says the overpass,  with a grade of 20 percent, violates the Canadian Human Rights  Act which prohibits discrimination  against disabled people "in the  provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodations customarily available to the general public."  Meister's complaint generated  broad public attention when the  Ports Canada police intelligence  unit decided to investigate her  background to determine whether  she was planning "any other ag-  According to a Ports Canada  spokesperson the agency's Director General has ordered a head  office review of the police action.  The spokesperson noted that the  Ports unit is designed to investigate criminal activities.  Meister says she took the action for the simple reason that she  B.C.'s AIDS education focuses on abstinence  by Nancy Pollak  As part of its $1.4 million  AIDS education campaign, the  B.C. Ministry of Health has distributed to B.C. households pamphlets which advise abstinence  from sex or monogamy with an  infection-free partner, rather than  safe sex practices, as the best  means of avoiding the HP/ virus.  The ministry's approach is at  odds with that of grass-roots AIDS  educators, one of whom suggested  "people will laugh at 'no sex' if  that's how you answer their questions about safety."  Martha McCarthy, project manager of the ministry's ADDS Public Education Program, doesn't expect the public to respond with  laughter. "We hired a research  company to study focus groups (a  random sampling of various B.C.  communities) ... and found that  people want the facts from the  government. They trust the government. They believe the government."  If people believe the government  brochure entitled "Be Responsible ... For Life," they will "relax" if they haven't had sex with  a homosexual, a bisexual, a needle drug user, an AIDS patient,  a haemophiliac,  or anyone they  didn't know well.  That's just the kind of relaxing  people advocating safe sex want  to discourage. According to Ken  Mann of AIDS Vancouver, "Our  position on education is to assume  you should practice safe sex; not  'who can I blame?', but how can  both of us be responsible."  While McCarthy states that the  pamphlet aims to deliver "the pertinent facts ... with an emphasis on being responsible," the facts  about the viral infection are entangled with unexplicit references to  "high risk behaviours," apparently  referring to non-monogamous sexual activity, rV drug use and gay  sex. Yet, as McCarthy says, "Most  of the population isn't concerned  with high risk behaviours ... and  this pamphlet isn't intended for  people with high risk behaviours."  Martin Laba of the AIDS Vancouver board of directors acknowledges that the pamphlet, by stressing abstinence, reflects the government's line, a line he characterizes as "severe behaviour modification." Still, Laba adds, "it's a  useful pamphlet, since any educational material is helpful ... for  many people, AIDS is only a head-  Laba admits that the brochure  is of limited value to the gay community who he described as being  already "very well informed."  Not all ADDS educators would  agree. One worker at ADDS Vancouver lamented that, "It's just  not true that people with high risk  behaviours are being reached—  we're lucky if we're getting 25 percent of gay men."  Gay and bisexual men, whose  infection rate at this time is higher  than the general Canadian population, are unlikely to embrace  the pamphlet's warning to "Avoid  anal sex-it is very dangerous," advice which blossoms into "it is  always dangerous" on the ministry's AIDS Line telephone message.  When it was pointed out to McCarthy that this was like telling  heterosexual people to avoid vaginal sex, McCarthy responded that,  "our intention is that homosexual  men use condoms ... and become  monogamous."  The pamphlet's homophobia is  consistent with its anti-sex approach. As Mann of AIDS Vancouver says, "We're not apologizing for sexual activity. Sex isn't the  problem, the virus is."  Mann is also critical of the  brochure's focus on the ADDS antibodies blood test. (The pamphlet stresses the idea of being  "infection-free", and describes the  test as "very accurate after six  months of infection.")  "The government ignores the  fact that there are many liabilities  in having the test," Mann says, referring to the lack of civil rights  for people who test HIV-positive,  and the proposed ADDS quarantine bill introduced this summer  as amendments to the Provincial  Health Act.  Lezlie Wagman has met with  hundreds of people during her educational work with AIDS Vancouver. "This pamphlet won't be  taken seriously since it doesn't  provide many options ... and  it doesn't credit people with being able to make responsible decisions," says Wagman.  The politicians, according to  Martha McCarthy, have already  made their decision. "Let's face it,  this is a very political thing," says  McCarthy. "We're dealing with  taxpayers' money and politicians  are very sensitive about how this  will impact on their constituencies." It would appear the politicians would rather be sensitive  than safe.  "couldn't get to the park" and  said that she's "sick and tired of  the jerks who pay lip service to  accessibility for disabled people."  "They'll talk about human rights  codes and Meech Lake agreements  but they never do anything concrete about accessibility," she said.  According to Meister, "Its not  just the disabled who are being  discriminated against." "You have  to be strong and fit," she said, "to  get up there. The elderly, children,  mothers with strollers, have problems too."  The only time Meister has been  able to visit the park was when a  friend pushed her across the overpass. She said she had a "terrifying  experience trying to come down."  "I put the breaks on , but they  didn't hold," she said. "Luckily, I  stopped against the guardrail."  Meister is confident that her  complaint will be upheld since  "You just have to look at the overpass and you can see its clearly a  case of discrimination against people with disabilities."  She is urging the Commission  to order that the Port reopen an  underpass that used to give access to the area and says that as  a short term measure the grade  level crossing at the railway tracks  should be reopened.  The overpass controversy has  been building for months as similar criticisms have been made  about the lack of access by Create a Real Alternative Beach, a  neighborhood group, and the British Columbia Coalition for the  Disabled, both of whom are supporting Meister's complaint to the  Commission.  Local New Democrat Member  of Parliament, Margaret Mitchell,  has criticized the Ports Canada  investigation in a letter to John  Crosbie, Minister of Transportation. Saying that "the treatment  of protesters as subversives is appalling", Mitchell is demanding a  ministerial investigation of Ports  Canada.  KINESIS   87 C ACROSS  B.C  New  housing rules  threaten co-ops  by Noreen Howes  British Columbia's Social Credit  government has a new co-operative  housing program which effectively  denies affordable housing to thousands, while threatening to kill the  spirit of co-operative living.  The program, which administers rental subsidies to coop housing developments, became  a provincial responsibility earlier  this year in an attempt by the  federal housing ministry to share  costs with the provinces.  Under B.C.'s new program only  thirty percent of a co-op's suites  are subsidized while the remaining  seventy percent must be rented at  a market rate.  One major problem for the cooperative housing sector is the fact  that units, and not people, are  subsidized; giving the co-op less  flexibility to assist as many members as possible. In the past, coops were given a certain amount of  subsidy money to use at their discretion.  Dale Webber of Inner City Development Housing Society says as  much as eighty percent could be  subsidized in the past. "The co-op  could spread their subsidy money  thick or thin, according to member  needs."  Under another new regulation,  half the subsidized units must  come from a B.C. Housing waiting list, while historically coops have chosen members entirely  from their own lists. As well as  wresting more control from the coop, and furthering complications  on an administrative level, these  referrals are potentially problematic because a referred person may  not be co-operative-minded.  "We'll get people who will treat  co-ops like public housing instead  of co-ops," says Webber "because  they were sent from a social service agency and don't know what  they're getting into."  Because the program is young,  it's not yet clear how freely a coop can reject a person referred by  B.C. Housing.  Only people most in need of  subsidized housing, and who fit  one of the following criterion, will  be referred.  • single, over 55 years of age or  • disabled over 18 years (with disability pension) or  • family       with       income  under $25,000.  Mary Flynn of Co-operative  Housing Federation of B.C. points  out the potential problems with  subsidized versus market rent  members.  "Having two such different income brackets could set up a  potentially dangerous situation  where, for example, people in the  market rental suites might want  people on fixed income to do all  the co-op-related work."  What's at stake is the replacement of an egalitarian co-operative  community with a clearly recognized two class system.  Co-op advocates also fear the  difficulty in attracting members  who must pay the higher market rent. A gap exists between  those able to get subsidy, said  Flynn, and those able to afford  non-subsidized units.  "We're not able to house people who really need it ... those  in the mid category, who are unable to pay the market rent, but  if they could get even a small subsidy, then they could afford it."  A fairly broad grouping of people will fall into this gap, said  Doug Robinson of Building Independent Living for the Disabled  (BILD).  "People who aren't low income  enough, such as working women  with a reasonable salary, single  people, couples with one party  working, single parents ..." will  be denied co-op housing.  The option to customize units  would also become available to  members in the higher income  bracket, further fuelling class distinctions. Dishwashers and fireplaces could be installed for those  able to pay the price.  Doug Robinson says customizing certain units might be necessary just to attract wealthier  people into the co-op. "The cooperative housing sector is very  concerned about this happening,"  he said. "The province doesn't  want to see their subsidy money go  toward this and yet we might have  to do it, just to make them more  marketable."  A further impediment to finding members able to afford market  rates, said Webber, is that whereas  con't on page 7  photo by Janet Altshool  Vancouver's annual Take Back the Night march saw over 400 women march along one of the city's major streets on Sept 18th to demand freedom from male violence. The marchers were accompanied by giant puppets representing different women and their struggles for autonomy. Similar marches took place  across Canada and around the world. Vancouver's protest was organized by Vancouver Rape Relief, who  once again defied city by-laws by refusing to apply for a march permit.   B.C. conference examines apartheid  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The situation in Southern Africa  since 1984 shows clearly that  South Africa's black majority is  determined to abolish apartheid.  Despite two years of massive repression, the South African government has been able neither to  break the resistance nor to recapture political support.  Today white South Africa is polarized as never before. The worst  and longest recession in South  African history has elevated black  unemployment to as high as six  million and no group in the white  establishment has been able to  come up with a viable political initiative, let alone a strategy to end  apartheid.  The next conference of Commonwealth leaders is to be held  in Vancouver, October 13-18. The  conference is scheduled to have  South Africa and sanctions as  a major agenda item. Commonwealth conferences create a great  deal of public interest; however,  they provide few opportunities for  public participation. Because of  this the Anti-Apartheid Network  and the Canadian Council for International Cooperation are co-  sponsoring a Parallel Commonwealth Conference on Southern  Africa to encourage public involvement.  Activities are planned for the  week of October 9-17 which include a national conference, a  provincial conference, public meetings, a fundraising evening for  Mozambique and other related  events.  There will be a dinner with  presentations on Saturday, October 10 at which Canadian personalities such as Shirley Carr,  President of the Canadian Labour  Congress, Archbishop Ted Scott,  Juanita Westmoreland Troare and  George Erasmus, from the Assembly of First Nations are scheduled  to speak on the Canadian role at  the Commonwealth Summit. Tickets are still available for the event,  P.I.D. meeting slated for Nov.  Pelvic inflammatory disease  (PED) is an epidemic affecting  thousands of Canadian women.  The latest figures from Health and  Welfare Canada indicate that over  180,000 Canadian women were  hospitalized for PDD in 1983/84  (Canada Diseases Weekly Report,  August, 1987). If present trends  continue, Dr. Willard Cates of the  Atlanta Centre for Disease Control estimates that by the year  2000, one in four North American  women will have or have had PID.  The consequences of PDD are serious and include peritonitis, infertility, scarring and adhesion of the  pelvic organs, chronic pain, recurring infection, ectopic pregnancy  (which is life threatening), disability, and death.  PDD is the leading cause of infertility and hysterectomy in young  women. Women who have had PDD  have a greatly increased risk of recurring infection and a 20 percent  risk of developing chronic PID. After one episode of PID a woman's  chances of becoming infertile are  15 percent; after three episodes of  PID her risk of infertility is 75 percent.  These are sobering statistics.  But despite the serious and epidemic nature of this disease there  is little public awareness. The  Canadian PID Society was formed  by women with PID who wanted  to change this situation: to reduce  the incidence of PDD through public education and prevention; to  provide support, information, and  assistance to women with PDD and  their families; and to improve the  resources, health care, and support systems available to women  with PID.  This year a public information  session on PID will be held in  conjunction with the society's annual general meeting. In addition  to general business, an Australian  produced public education video  about PID as well as a discussion  with Dr. Lynn Simpson, a Vancouver gynecologist, will be presented. Resource materials and information about PDD will be available. Everyone is invited to attend.  The Canadian PID Society's  annual general meeting will  be held on Tuesday November 3, 7:80-10:80 pm at Gordon Neighborhood House, 1019  Broughton Ave., Vancouver.  For more information please  call 684-5704 or 685-7094 after  11 am.  which will take place at the Georgia Hotel Ballroom in Vancouver.  The provincial conference, the  first in four years, is planned for  October 11 and 12. Since the  last provincial conference in 1983,  much has changed in Southern  Africa. For the vast majority of  B.C. residents the only access to  information on Southern Africa  has been through the media. Over  the last years this medium has  proven unreliable, partly as a result of severe press restrictions imposed by the South African government.  The goal of the provincial conference is to provide a historical, political and economic context for the events that have taken  place in Southern Africa since  1983. The provincial conference  will also examine what support  British Columbians can provide.  President Kenneth Kaunda, of  Zambia, has confirmed that he will  speak at the conference's opening  plenary and public meeting at the  Holiday Inn Harbourside, October  11, at 7 pm. President Kaunda  is chair of the Organization of  African Unity (OAU), the umbrella group of African states and  the chair of the Frontline States  neighbouring South Africa.  Also speaking that night will be  Foreign Affairs Minister Mocumbi  of Mozambique, and representatives from the Congress of  Trade Unions in South Africa, the  African National Congress and the  South West Africa Peoples Organization.  The Provincial Conference will  begin with the Sunday evening  public event and will continue all  day on October 12 at Vancouver's  Georgia Hotel.

Baby R.:  Profound implications for maternity rights  by Maggie Thompson  "This woman is not on trial". With  those words court room number nine at the  New Westminster Court House broke into  laughter. The presiding judge was offended.  Unauthorized laughter in his court room  was just not on. He gave a belligerent lecture about respect and boorish behaviour,  and promptly cleared the courtroom.  The words came from Ministry of Social  Services and Housing (MSSH) lawyer, Tom  Gove, as part of his summary in what has  become known as the Baby R case, involving a woman we'll call Rose. His claim suggests that he was on the defensive.  sion became Zouves's only option. Ministry  social worker Ivan Bulic, who had never  met Rose, agreed to apprehend her unborn child. He did so with no social service  ministry records whatsoever. Mary Conway,  Rose's current social worker, testified that  all Rose's records had been destroyed in a  fire!  While all this was going on, the staff at  Grace hospital continued to try to convince  Rose to agree to a caesarean section. After  viewing ultrasound images she agreed. By  this time the apprehension had happened  but the reason for it had disappeared. At  10:50 pm she delivered a healthy baby boy  who the doctor described as "vigourous at  birth".  Briefly, the case began at 3 pm on May  20 this year when Rose entered Grace hospital in labour. It was her fifth birth, the  previous four resulted in healthy babies all  born vaginally. Her baby was in a footling  breech position, its feet rather than its head  appearing first. Attending physician Zou-  ves concluded that "The baby would die or  would be seriously or permanently injured"  without a caesarean section. Rose refused to  have a caesarean.  Zouves phoned the Ministry of Social Services and Housing in order to find a way to  force Rose to have a caesarean. After a hospital psychiatrist and MSSH's Emergency  Health Team would not intervene under  the Canadian Mental Health Act, apprehen-  Regulations outlined in B.C.'s Protection  of Children Act, which gives MSSH the authority to apprehend children, require that  each apprehension case be brought to the  court for a 'Presentation Hearing' within  seven days of the child's apprehension. After  several postponements and a failed attempt  by the Women's Legal Education Action  Fund (LEAF) to intervene in the case, the  presentation hearing began on July 13th.  Day after day, for an entire week, Gove  prompted the recollections and glib comments from social workers and doctors.  Each recounted their version of carefully selected incidents in this woman's life.  We heard that one morning the cereal she  fed her first child was not appropriate, that  her friends were not suitable, and that while  she displayed love and affection for her children, she could not provide for them. One  social worker referred to her behaviour on  one occasion as 'schizoid', another remarked  that her breath smelled like she had had  two beers, yet another says that her friends  used hard drugs, such as heroin. Evidence  from social workers who hadn't seen Rose  in years was presented as an indication of  her current behaviour.  Testimony throughout the five long days  of hearing was full of harsh, judgmental, uncorroborated comments. The issue  of parental competence and Rose's lifestyle  was used as a smokescreen to hide the fact  that the apprehension was totally illegal and  unjustified. Tom Gove's entire line of argument was to put this woman's lifestyle  on trial. The unfortunate thing is that just  about everyone has bought his line.  In his ruling Family Court judge Brian  Davis said, "This is not a case of women's  rights ... this is simply a case to determine  what is best for the safety and well being of  this child."  The heart of Davis's decision is summed  up in this quote: "Under those circumstances, namely where the baby is at or so  near term and birth is imminent, the failure to provide necessary medical attention  to prevent death or serious injury is sufficient to allow the Superintendent to invoke  the procedure of apprehension".  tain things during their pregnancies or, as  in this case, to coerce women to give birth  in a way they would not otherwise choose.  The right of anyone to refuse treatment  is firmly grounded in Canadian law. Along  with this right goes the obligation of caregivers to seek free, full and informed consent for medical treatments they deem necessary. During birth there is a delicate balancing of the rights and needs of a woman  and her unborn baby. The needs of both 'patients' are better served when the woman's  concerns are fully addressed, when she is  fully informed and when she is treated with  care and respect. In his ruling Davis makes  no reference to the need to balance these  rights. It's as though Rose and her rights  don't exist.  Caesarean sections are very controversia  in the medical community; few situations  are clear-cut. On the word of one doctor  the MSSH brought all the pressure it coulc  bear to coerce Rose into a procedure she die  not want.  Yet few observers recognize that it is the  doctor who gains most from this ruling.  Without involving the social worker, as he]  did, the doctor would have to bear responsibility for his actions alone. Here, not only  the social worker but also the court has  acted to protect his interests and credibility  at the expense of a very vulnerable woman  On the word of some doctor,  the MSSH brought all the pressure  it could bear to coerce Rose into  a procedure she did not want.  In essence, Davis contended that the  medical rights of a pregnant woman are secondary to the rights of her unborn child or  fetus. It is absurd to think that such a ruling is not a women's rights issue. By implication, Davis's decision concluded that Zouves had the right to pressure Rose, cut her  open and take her child.  Sadly, Rose has been used. Difficult times  in her life have been put on display for  all to see and judge. The media in its  lust for sensationalism paints the picture of  a schizophrenic, heroin addicted, alcoholic.  Privately we distance ourselves, we think we  have nothing in common with her.  Basic rights at stake  Yet there are fundamental issues that we  share with Rose. Like us she is fighting for  some kind of control over her life. She is  fighting to have her wishes taken seriously.  Above all she is fighting against poverty in  an effort to have her basic needs met.  Let's not allow ourselves to believe what  we've been told about Rose without ever  hearing a word from her. Let's not agree  with the prosecution's strategy to judge  this woman on her lifestyle, in the way  that thousands of rape victims have been  judged. Let's not skim over the impropriety  of events that night at Grace hospital.  Many of the implications of this case are  obvious to women's rights activists. Since  Canadian law does not distinguish between  an eight week old fetus and a thirty-eight  week old fetus in the process of birth, this  precedent could be used to apprehend fetuses at any stage of gestation. Once on the  legal slippery slope there is no telling how  far decisions will slide.  Conceivably apprehensions could be used  to prevent women from having abortions,  they could be used to force women to do cer-  This case provides ample evidence of the  increasing attack on women's reproductive  rights and of the growing confidence of the  state to launch these attacks. However this  case also exposes the weaknesses in the very  social service system that so much wants to  control our lives.  Rose's story painfully reminds us that the  system has failed. It has failed to provide adequate assistance and support for a woman  in need. Not only has it failed to provide ...  it has failed to be fair. How can a ministry  that pays a pregnant woman on social assistance only $375 per month, expect her to be  housed, fed and cared for adequately? How  can a court system that treats someone with  such cruelty ever serve justice? Frankly, it  can't.  At press time the Committee for Maternal Autonomy learned that Rose intends to appeal the decision. Her lawyer  will launch a Judicial Review with the  Supreme Court of B.C. A Judicial Review will rule on whether Davis's conclusions were proper given the evidence  before him. A successful review will not  overturn the decision but will require  another hearing to be held. All power to  you Rose. You've got courage.  Join the fight against this decision.

Across Canada  Free trade opposition on the increase  by Ann Franklin  As the October 5 deadline for  a free trade deal with the United  States was approaching, organizing efforts against any deal were  on the upswing in B.C., and opposition to free trade was growing  across the country.  In B.C., a broad range of popular sector groups joined together  in late September to launch an Ad  Hoc Coalition Against Free Trade.  And earlier in the month, a detailed public opinion poll showed  that more Canadians now oppose  a free trade deal than support it,  for the first time since the Mulroney government initiated free  trade talks with the U.S.  The Ad Hoc Coalition held  a news conference in Vancouver  September 24 to release a statement opposing any free trade deal,  and to announce a rally against  free trade which was to be held  outside trade minister Pat Carney's Vancouver offices on October  The broadly-based coalition is  endorsed by more than thirty-five  groups, including labour unions,  community groups, women's organizations, church groups, cultural  associations and environmental  groups. Among the women's organizations participating are the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women, Vancouver Status of Women, and the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective.  At the news conference, held the  day after Canadian trade negotiator Simon Reisman "suspended"  the free trade talks, the groups  said they were skeptical that Reis-  man's announcement was more  than a negotiating manoeuver, and  called for talks to be cancelled altogether.  The coalition's statement said  that any free trade deal with the  U.S. "poses a grave threat to our  livelihood and our way of life."  Some changes would immediately  follow an agreement, while other  changes would happen more gradually  as   Canada's   policies   and  regulations are "harmonized" to  match those in the U.S.  "We are confident that as more  people understand what is at stake  in a free trade agreement, the overwhelming majority of Canadians  will reject such an agreement," the  statement said.  The coalition said potential  costs of a free trade deal include  massive job loss, loss of sovereignty  in our cultural industries, and  erosion of social programs such  as medicare, unemployment insurance and family allowance to compete with lower social welfare standards commonplace in the U.S.  Free trade would also undermine our public sector, the groups  said, through increasing privatization of crown corporations and  contracting out of public services  to private firms. And it would  lead to even greater American control of Canada's natural resources,  which would discourage the development of secondary industries  and leave western Canada strictly  as a producer of raw materials for  export.  Representatives of groups in the  coalition elaborated on the effects  a free trade deal would have on  their members and in their sectors.  Vancouver Sataus of Women's  Patty Gibson warned that a free  trade deal threatens 800,000 manufacturing jobs across Canada,  and added that the industries  where women are concentrated—  such as textiles and clothing, small  electrical products, leather products and toys—are especially vulnerable.  Many more jobs are at risk  in the service sector, which dominates Canada's economy and  where 80 percent of working  women are employed, Gibson said.  Free trade in services would  threaten job loss in industries  like communications, financial services, advertising, transportation,  data processing and health care.  Tom Smith of the Brewery  Workers  Union  Local  300  said  18,000 jobs are at stake in the B.C.  brewing industry alone, while 63  percent of the 188,000 jobs in the  entire Canadian brewing industry  would be lost.  Artists and performers also face  an immediate job threat under any  free trade deal, according to Marian Fraser of ACTRA.  gus Reid Associates for the Pro-  Canada Network, a national coalition formed to fight a free trade  deal.  "There has been a significant  decline in public support over the  past six months in all regions of  the country, moving public opinion from a majority support posi-  The coalition's statement emphasized that neither the federal government, nor the Vander Zalm government which has  been its biggest booster among the  provinces, has any mandate supporting the push toward a free  trade agreement.  And the coalition backed the  demand made by organizations  across Canada for a general federal election on the issue before  any free trade agreement with the  U.S. is signed and implemented.  Public support for a free trade  deal has fallen drastically in recent months, according to a poll  conducted in late August by An-  tion this past February to 42 percent in favour and 44 percent opposed currently," the poll says.  There was a sharp drop in support in B.C., where support for a  free trade deal nonetheless remains  highest in the country, according  to the poll. In February, 69 percent  of B.C. residents surveyed were in  favour of a free trade deal, while  that number had dropped to 50  percent of B.C. residents by late  August.  The poll also showed that 62  percent of British Columbians believe the Mulroney government has  done a poor job of informing Canadians about the free trade negotiations.  A  large majority  of  Federal fund ignores women  by Nancy Pollak  Women in Canada's western  provinces should expect little—  or nothing—from Ottawa's latest  scheme to revitalize the region's  economy, says the Manitoba Advisory Council on the Status of  Women.  According to economist and  council member Michele Pujol, the  Tories' Federal Western Diversification Initiative, unveiled August  4th in Edmonton, "... completely  fails to generate new economic opportunities for women. As a matter of fact, women are simply not  mentioned at all ... "  Very little of anything was mentioned when Brian Mulroney announced the five-year $1.2 billion regional development strategy. Commentators were quick to  point out that the figure may actually represent less money than  previously supplied to the region  by the now defunct Department of  Regional Industrial Expansion.  Businesses, local governments  and universities will be entitled to  grants based on unspecified criteria. Earlier this year, Mulroney  handed out similar plums to business interests in the Maritimes and  northern Ontario.  While NDP and Liberal critics  attacked the proposal as "chest-  beating and bragging" and "a  slush fund for the next election",  Pujol notes that the initiative fails  to even live up to its name: "...  (The federal plan) does not propose industrial diversification, but  further industrial specialization  of the west in resource-related industries."  An economic strategy of this  sort is not only irrelevant to most  women's employment needs, Pu  jol argues,  it  also represents  « ...a faintly disguised proposal  to restructure the western economy towards a single objective:  free trade."  "Womens  economic  concerns are  seen as  soft,  or wimpy."  By injecting capital into the primary resource sector (e.g. agriculture and mining), the Tories  hope to increase exports of unmanufactured goods to the U.S.,  says Pujol. Neglecting the Canadian market for goods and services  means neglecting both longterm  Canadian—and women's—needs,  since female employment is concentrated in the service sector.  The only non-resource-based industries receiving the Tory nod  were aircraft and communication  manufacturing: defence industries,  Pujol notes.  The brunt of Pujol's criticisms,  however, were reserved for the proposal's underlying economic philosophy.  " The social aspects of economic development are nowhere  addressed in the federal initiative ... (This is) narrow, misguided and reflects a biased definition of economic development  which favours traditionally male-  dominated occupations and sectors of the economy." Pujol argues that social services, including childcare centres, crisis shelters  and reproductive health facilities,  British Columbians—71 percent—  would prefer the Canadian government to give first priority to  trade negotiations with a number  of countries, with only 26 percent  feeling that talks with the U.S.  should get top priority.  A particularly interesting series  of questions in the poll dealt with  Canadians' perceptions of the possible effects of a free trade deal  on Canada's economy, culture and  sovereignty, and social services and  quality of life.  These questions posed sixteen  possible consequences of a free  trade deal. The poll asked two  questions in each case: whether  respondents thought the consequences would actually result;  and then, if government research  proved that such a consequence  would occur, whether they would  be more or less likely to support a  free trade deal.  The most revealing answers  were to questions about the impact of free trade on social services  and quality of life. For example:  • Only 38 percent of Canadians  think that free trade would lead  to the Canadian health care  system becoming more like the  private health care system in  the U.S. However, if research  showed that this would happen,  then 81 percent of Canadians  would oppose a free trade deal.  • Two-thirds of Canadians do not  believe that free trade would  cause any deterioration in the  quality of our education system.  But 80 percent of Canadians  would be less likely to support  free trade if it were shown that  free trade would harm education.  • Only 26 percent of Canadians  believe that a free trade deal  would affect women's rights or  women's access to social services and employment equity.  But if it were proven that  free trade would harm women's  rights, then 75 percent of Canadians would oppose a deal.  "should be an integral part of all  development."  Melanie Conn, of the  Vancouver-based Community Economic Options (a Working Group  of WomenSkills), shares many of  Pujol's concerns: "Not only are  women invisible in the planning,  but we know, absolutely, that  women will not be involved in deciding how the money is spent."  In traditional circles, Conn says,  women's economic concerns "are  seen as 'soft', as wimpy ... Yet  pouring funds into mills dependent on outside money and international markets doesn't work ...  "This isn't even a radical feminist notion. Men in communities  are starting to see what women  have known for a long time ...  (We need) integrated economic development, using human and other  resources."  Pujol also advocates training  for women in high technology  fields, and special encouragements  to native women, disabled women  and women from visible minority  groups.  -, KINESIS  Oct. '87 Across Canada  /^^^^%^%?^^  WHAT1 S NEWS?  by Patty Gibson  Legal aid cut  Saskatchewan's legal aid plan  has suffered another major blow  with the introduction of a $60 user  fee. The fee was brought in last  August due to the effects of cutbacks and freezes over a five-year  period on the legal aid budget.  Critics do not think the user fee  can salvage the legal aid program  and say the user fee will ensure  those who need the program most  won't be able to afford it.  Club admits  women  Another male bastion bit the  dust in mid-September when the  Britain-based Canada Club voted  overwhelmingly to allow women  membership.  Canada's High Commissioner to  Britain sparked the controversy  which led to the September 15th  vote when he refused to chair the  Club's annual dinners because of  the discriminatory admissions policy. McMurtry had stated publicly  last summer that a club calling itself the Canada Club "in this day  and age is at best childish and at  worst deeply offensive" in not admitting women.  When McMurtry took the post  in 1985 he ordered Canadian diplomats holding memberships in the  club to let them lapse. The resolution which ended the 177 year  policy on women received only two  dissenting votes.  Globe and Mail  Porn study  An American study of sex portrayal has concluded that nonviolent pornography is detrimental to society's view of women. Although the University of Kentucky  Communications professor James  Weaver, heading the study, says  popular, non-violent pornographic  or erotic material leads to a loss of  respect for women's self- determination, he does not support censorship.  In an interview with the Globe  and Mail Weaver said, "We are  not advocating censorship in any  form, but we have to be informed."  He  added  that  people  knowing  the effects of something are better  equipped to deal with it and censorship will do nothing but "make  a forbidden fruit that much more  forbidden and desireable."  Battered wife  acquitted  Angelique Lyn Lavallee became  the first woman in Canada to  be acquitted for killing her husband on the evidence of battered  wife syndrome. Although abused  women have been acquitted on  similar charges in Canada, the  Winnipeg case is the first where  a judge instructed a jury to consider battered wife syndrome as  evidence.  Lavallee shot and killed her  common-law husband David Rust  after he pulled her from a bedroom closet where she was hiding,  loaded a rifle in front of her, and  threatened to kill her when everyone left a party at the couple's  home.  Battered wife syndrome is considered a situation in which a  woman finds herself trapped as a  victim of abuse.  Canadian Press  Tax reform  criticized  Several groups analyzing Wilson's tax reform plan conclude  it will not help the poor. The  Economic Council of Canada says  the changes give more to middle-  income individuals than low income individuals; the government's own National Council of  Welfare says both low and middle income individuals do not fare  as well as high-income people; and  the National Anti-Poverty Coalition says Wilson's measures tax  the poor in increasing numbers.  According to National Council of Welfare figures a household with an income of $100,000  or more will realize a tax saving  of $4,400. Households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 will  save $700 and households in the  $15,000 to $30,000 a year bracket  will save only $405. But a household with income of less than  $15,000 will see its tax bill fall  by no more than $140. In addition the current $710 tax credit for  each dependent child will drop to  65 cents after tax reform with no  credit available to dependent children over the age of eighteen.  New cruise  missile  The U.S. Defence Department  is developing a new cruise missile. According to Pentagon officials the new missile would be  high-explosive, non-nuclear, with  a capacity to hit, within centimeters, a target up to 4,800 kilometers away.  Among those features lauded by  officials describing the new missile  is the ability to have a weapon for  use against terrorists, as new guidance systems will enable a cruise  missile to target the building at  which it is aimed.  Canada Post has also been  pouring money into an extensive  public relations campaign in the  month leading up to the virtually  inevitable walkout. The Corporation, in a plan approved by the federal cabinet last spring, is spending an estimated one million dollars for full page newspaper ads  in Canadian dailies with a circulation of 50,000 and more. The  ads laud Canada Post's "improved  service" but do not mention that  franchising will replace union jobs  with non-union jobs paying minimum wage. Nor do they respond  to CUPW charges that franchising is open to patronage and could  be used to direct millions into the  pockets of Tory business people.  Pollack believes the conflict at  the post office is the result of  "a Tory government agenda to  push down wages in Canada" She  says CUPW will win the strike,  partly because the public is "sick  and tired of postal services being  eroded."  Pollack is urging supporters to  aid postal workers by not using the  mail system after September 30,  the legal strike date. CUPW says  the public must demonstrate to  government that Canadians do not  support postal privatization and  service cutbacks.  con't from page 3  "What women have to realize," says Pollack, "is that over  40 percent of CUPW members are  women and the post office privatization plan means the disappearance of a lot of jobs where  women are earning a decent income. The franchising of postal  services means the establishment  of yet another low wage job ghetto  for women."  Canada Post doesn't deny wages  will fall. The Corporation justifies it as a necessary step if the  post office is to become a profit-  making enterprise. As one Canada  Post spokesperson says, "We have  to operate as a business."  The Canadian Postmasters and  Assistants Association (CPAA),  80 percent of whom are women,  is particularly concerned about  Canada Post's privatization  agenda.  The 10,000 member national  union represents workers in more  than 5,000 rural post offices who  currently earn $12.44 an hour.  Post office management has plans  to close hundreds of the smallest outlets and sell the remaining  3,500 offices to rural business owners. The post office's ten year privatization plan would convert an  estimated 7,000 union jobs into gas  station and grocery jobs paying as  little as the minimum wage.  The loss of the traditional rural post office strikes at the heart  of rural communities. These outlets are typically located in general  stores which serve as important  meeting places for country people.  If no business people come forward  to take up Canada Post's franchise  option, rural people will be served  by group mail boxes or will have  to travel to larger centres to use  postal services.  Not surprisingly, dozens of rural  communities have fought Canada  Post in efforts to maintain postal  services. But the battles have been  in vain as not a single community  slated for this improved service has  managed to convince the post office to reconsider its plans.  One postmistress in a small Ontario town whose post office is  slated for closure says, "The federal government is chiselling away  at all services in rural Canada. The  railway is gone and now they want  to take the post office."  Some roadblocks, however, have  been put in the way of the  post office's full steam ahead approach to franchising and privatization. Two recent decisions bv the  Canada Labour Relations Board  (CLRB) may prove to be serious setbacks to the corporation's  franchise plans. In September, the  CLRB ruled that franchise operations must pay employees current  union wages and benefits.  Since franchising is attractive  to business chiefly because it is  based on radically reduced wage  costs the ruling may put post office plans in jeopardy. The post office announced in late September  that they will appeal the franchise  ruling to the Federal Court of Appeal. The appeal will be based on  arguments that the CLRB acted  beyond its jurisdiction.  Meanwhile during the strike the  corporation has pledged to again  use strikebreakers to keep the mail  moving if a walkout occurs despite the lingering memory of violent confrontations between members of the letter carriers union  and strikebreakers last June.  According to one post office official in Vancouver the letter carriers strike taught the post office  "...how to stay in business and operate during a strike. The more  you do things, the more you learn  about things." The strikebreakers  will be paid $13.25 an hour, the  same as union rates.  con't from page 4  the market rents paid in co-ops  used to be at the low end of the  market, now they're average.  With this new co-op program  not only would class distinctions  be clear and thousands of moderate income people excluded, but a  co-op might be driven into a competitive real estate market.  Historically, co-op  housing members have been provided with a fair distribution of  subsidy money, thereby guaranteeing them security in the event of  job loss or illness.  "Ten percent of co-op subsidy  money would be held back for people who, if they had a drop of  income, would be supplemented"  said Dana Webber. This no longer  exists. Instead, each co-op will institute a new program called "security of tenure" automatically deducting $5 per month from everyone's rent, and putting it into a security fund.  "But it takes years for this to  add up into a significant amount  of money," says Webber. It's ineffectiveness means that "if you rent  a non-subsidized suite, you better  have a secure job!"  A national lobby campaign for  new co-op housing units and increased subsidy is on-going in the  co-op housing sector.  "The co-operative housing  movement is poised on the edge of  either a great success or a great  crisis," according to Co-operative  Housing Foundation of Canada  president Shirley Schmid.  In B.C., co-op housing development is down while waiting lists  continue to grow. "In the False  Creek area for instance," says  Flynn, "it takes two or three years  just to get an interview. And yet  less units were built this year, less  money coming in ... "  The new program has dealt  B.C.'s co-op housing sector a major blow. For an increasing number of B.C. residents co-op housing has been the logical answer to  the problems associated with purchasing a home.  Unfortunately, the B.C. government restrictions on co-op housing will ensure the co-op option is  not available to those who need it  most: a unique way of recognizing this year's International Year  of Shelter for the Homeless.

The  mother, a 27 year old, had been  confined for 16 weeks in a Liverpool hospital in an effort to prolong her multiple pregnancy. At  birth, none of the seven babies  weighed even two pounds.

Quintana and Rojas were helping other student demonstrators  build a barricade of burning tires  during a general strike in July,  1986, when troops drove up and  began to beat them. Gasoline was  poured over them and they were  set on fire. Rojas died from his  injuries.

According to Belinda Barnes,  the founder of Foresight, an organization that stresses natural  preparations like diet and cutting  out drinking and smoking to enhance conception and reduce birth  defects, "It is criminal to try and  force a pregnancy on a body which  isn't fit for it."  Dr Patrick Steptoe, who pioneered test tube conception and  has supervised more than 1200  pregnancies at his clinic says, "If  the treatment is properly managed, multiple births like this just  don't happen."  According to some observers the  only reason the burning generated  attention around the world is because Rojas was the "adopted" son  of an American citizen who demanded action from both American and Chilean authorities. Similar incidents of police brutality go  unreported outside Chile.  The case against Captain Pedro  Fernandez, charged only with "unnecessary violence," may suffer because Quintana was only able to  identify the man with 90 percent  certainty and couldn't sign an official statement of identification.  The 200 soldiers she observed in  a series of line-ups darkened their  faces in an attempt to resemble  the men at the burning. Quintana  attributes her confusion to this.  She says the soldiers who beat and  burned her and Rojas "had only  streaks of black on their faces."  The case will be decided by a  single judge. Though Quintana is  weak from her ordeal and subsequent surgery, she says she is prepared to deal with what lies ahead.  She feels that she's being "accompanied by all the people of Chile."  Plexus  According to Steptoe, "Even if  you have made a mistake", and  too many eggs are fertilized, techniques exist to reduce the number (of eggs) although his clinic  "hasn't had to face that option."  Apparently reducing the number of eggs is not unknown in pregnancy clinics because it improves  the chances of survival of the remaining fetuses.

Ramashamela was convicted in  December, 1985, along with five  other members of the "Sharpsville  Six"of the 1984 murder of Khuz-  wayo Dlamini, deputy-mayor of a  black township. Dlamini, as an official in the puppet township government, was seen as a collaborator with the Botha regime. His  death came at the onset of a popular uprising against rent increases  in the Vaal area townships.  The violent repression which  this uprising has been met with  has resulted in the deaths of hundreds, in the arrest and detention  without trial of over 36,000, and in  the imposition of the state of emergency in South Africa.

Globe and Mail  U.S.  restricts  abortion  by Kinesis StafT Writer  New proposals announced by  the United States government  threaten tighter restrictions on  abortion related activities by family planning clinics that receive  federal government funding.  Under the proposals, a clinic  where abortion counselling is conducted would be prohibited from  receiving government funding even  if the counselling was financed by  private donations. Also, a clinic  receiving federal funds could not  provide a pregnant woman with  a doctor referral for an abortion, even if the woman requested  the information. The rules also  prevent family planning programs  supported with federal funds from  lobbying for pro- abortion legislation.  The practical effect of the proposed rules would be to cut off  federal money for thousands of  clinics, because clinic operators  feel an ethical obligation to advise pregnant women of the availability of abortion as an option. A spokesperson for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association said  the proposals would require that  clinics could only direct "poor  pregnant women to prenatal care  only."  Globe and Mail  Subscriber info  At press time the only thing we could be  reasonably certain of was that the Canadian  Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) would be  on strike sometime in October. We don't  know whether they will be on a full walkout  across the country or whether it will be rotating strikes, as was the case with the letter carriers strike in June. As a result we are  not sure what impact the strike will have on  subscribers. The following are suggestions  we hope might prove helpful.  If you have not received your Kinesis by  October 10th (Lower Mainland subscribers)  or October 15 elsewhere, we clearly have a  problem. There are a number of options:  If you live in Vancouver, you can drop by  the VSW office at 400 a West 5th and pick  up a copy. We've open Monday to Thursday, 9:30 to 5:pm.  If you don't live in Vancouver or if its inconvenient to drop by, you can pick up the  paper at any of our outlets. See this page  for a complete list. At an outlet, of course,  you'll have to pay and since you're already  a paying subscriber, that will be annoying.  So if you've decided to buy this October issue rather than miss out due to the postal  situation, drop us a line and we'll extend  your subscription.  If the above suggestions are unworkable  for you and you don't get an October issue  (you're reading a friend's now, let's say), let  us know and we'll extend your subscription.  Postal strikes make small magazine publishing particularly precarious since papers  like Kinesis simply don't have the financial  means to serve subscribers in other ways.

The day was picked to counter the October 12 celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the "Discovery of the Ameri-  v (Columbus Day). The 500th "anniversary" celebrations is seen by indigenous people as an effort by Europeans to rewrite history to deny the conquest, colonialism, and racism of whites  against indigenous people in the Americas.  This article reports on a recent indigenous people's conference and publicizes the growing threat industrialization presents to the Amazon River basin  and the indigenous people who have  lived there for thousands of years.  ttimiiiimuyiiutii.  by Jill Bend  Over sixty million hectares of Amazon rain forest is the new mega-  industrial centre of the world. Thirty  percent of the rain forest has been destroyed in the last ten years. Thirty nations of indigenous people face extinction. Many exotic species of animals are  already extinct, more are threatened.  The military has occupied these lands as  "National Security Zones." Hired mercenaries of industrial developers "pis-  toleros" are burning villages and assassinating indigenous people. There is a  crisis in the Amazon nations of South  America.  The urgency of halting the growing  military-industrial desecration of the Amazon rain forest brought the indigenous peoples of the Amazon River together for the  first International Conference of the Future  of the People and Environment in the Amazon.  Representatives of indigenous organizations from eight South American countries  met in Vienna, Austria in August to discuss resistance to the threats against the future of their nations and the environment.  Participating as well were over twenty-five  human rights and solidarity organizations  including indigenous representatives from  West Papua, India, Canada, Philippines and  Burma. International awareness and support activity is a crucial element to stopping industrial exploitation in the area  As the South Americans explained, the  conference was their first opportunity to  have the problems of the Amazonia presented and not just swept in with generalized indigenous concerns.  The area of concern is the Amazon River  watershed which spans nine national borders (Brazil, Surinam, Ecuador, Colombia,  Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Paraguay),  supports 300 indigenous tribes and countless species of fish, bird, and animal life  ... and is now home to the world's largest  multinational industrial development program.  "» H ^ V"r^/11 w* Uw^w  Military-Industrial Expansion  The governments of South American countries are paving the way to this exploitation by encouraging American, Japanese  and European business to move in promising massive tax subsidies. Corporations are  provided with military protection. In north  Brazil, 6000 kilometers have been militarily  occupied at the site of the Allamira Dam  project. "National Security Zones" have  been established around industrial lands to  force removal of the original peoples and to  prevent resistance to the human and environmental damage industrialization creates.  The Amazonia have always resisted such  attacks but expanded militarization has  brought ultra-modern communication and  equipment systems that preclude any grassroots opposition. Prisons are part and parcel of the occupation and many tribal people have spent time behind bars for resisting land thefts and violence. The consolidation of industrial and military power has  created an ominous "military dictatorship"  within a country, democracy or not.  The environmental destruction begins  with clearcut logging for timber profits and  to clear the way for construction of the highways, damns, industrial zones, and plantations that will be needed by the industrial  conglomerates. In 1976, 98 percent of the  original rain forest was undamaged, yet in  the ten years to 1986, 30 percent of that  area has been destroyed through clearcut-  ting and/or acid ram. As Padre Angelo  Pansa, from the Brazilian Mission of Xingu,  explained, "If we don't do something now,  in the next ten years, the entire area will be  destroyed."  Clearcut logging disturbs ground stability, threatens the micro-climate, and eventually destroys what is the oxygen household of the world. Gold and iron ore are  being dug from the mountains of the Amazon. The rivers and watertable are being diverted and contaminated. Seventy massive  hydro-electric power plants and dams are  planned at a construction rate of one a year.  All living beings in this vast jungle area  depend for survival on the purity of the land  and water. The eco-balance has been disrupted and the co-existence of humans and  animals is severely strained. The indigenous  communities are contracting diseases never  before known to them. For this reason, they  say they fear for their own survival as a people, another species threatened with extinction.  iiinnnwnuniiim*  Indigenous Survival  The Native peoples living in the valleys and  mountains along the Amazon and her tributaries still live dependent on the land, with  little of the accoutrements of civilization.  Many of the tribes remain clans of hunters  and gatherers, and some are the last remaining nomads in the world. The erosion of  their traditional ways due to western colonialism, and their threatened survival due  to industrial pollution, is tragic. To date,  the only international concern shown has  primarily been from anthropologists and  linguists intent on studying "primitive" societies. The Amazonia at this conference  asked such professionals to instead research  the cause of this threat, not simply the results.  The 300 indigenous tribes of the Amazon  are distinct ethnic groups, similar in many  ways yet still with their own languages and  traditions. They have operated within their  tribes until outside encroachment forced  them to set up regional and then national  associations to defend themselves.  Every nation insists on their right to defend the land, retain their culture and languages, develop their own economy, practice  their medicine, and determine their own education. In this way, the struggle in Amazonia has the common thread that runs  through all indigenous struggles worldwide.  The resistance always begins with a land-  based struggle against industrial development and environmental destruction.  "The land is our mother. Without land,  the Amazon Indian is nothing. We must defend our land", explained the Ecuadoran  representative.  Financial Backbone of Exploitation  Without the financial support of the world  monetary institutions, industrial megaprojects could not materialize. The "catch-  22" is that international money lenders  wield tremendous leverage over nations that  are already deep in debt to international  banks. They exert pressure on governments  to open access to resource exploitation by  the very corporations they fund. The Gran  Carajas project in Brazil is financed by  the World Bank and the European Economic Community. In Chile, the World  Bank was financing plans for hydro-electric  plants which the people were able to stop.  At the conference, there were two opposing perspectives on negotiations with international banks. Some of the Amazon delegates felt that they could trust the promises  of the World Bank to consult and respect  the indigenous position on development. Because they are striving for autonomy, that  must include the right of each nation to cooperate with whom they choose. The fear  of losing financial support, to develop community projects and small scale industry is  a dilemma of all struggling peoples.  "But the majority of votes within the  World Bank are American and we should  suspect their intentions, and learn from experience ... that they fund ethnocide and  bring in biased experts and indigenous representatives that conveniently agree with  World Bank policy and plans", retorted  Resolutions and Action  The Indigenous Nations of the Amazon demand the right to self-determination, along  with the right to retain their land, culture,  language, and traditions. They must be considered international societies with the protection of their rights being an international responsibility surpassing any national  or state restraints. An international solidarity campaign must be built and sustained  for the protection of the environment and  the people in the Amazon.  Toward that end, several suggestions  were put forward. A blacklist of organizations and institutions involved in land  expropriation must be drawn up and distributed so an international boycott campaign can begin.  Indigenous groups need supplies such as  short-wave communication systems to keep  them in close contact with each other, essential during emergencies.  At the closing press conference, the following resolutions were announced:  • Delegates demand that industrial megaprojects be stopped.  • That indigenous peoples of the Amazon  rights to their lands and territory be recognized.  • The governments of the Amazon regions,  along with financial institutions, support  alternative projects determined by the indigenous community.  • The Indigenous Nations must be endorsed in demands to the United Nations  to have 1992 declared "Year of the Indigenous People."  • October 12, 1987 is "International Day  Mapuche representative Rosa Surita. "It is  ridiculous to discuss autonomy and self-  determination when we are unwilling to denounce these projects that harm us. We  have concrete facts of the ethnocide and environmental destruction created by megaprojects that harm us.

We  must say that we will not accept any development money for any projects that will endanger indigenous lives and community."  of Solidarity with Struggles of Indigenous  Peoples." To support the efforts of Native  peoples throughout the Americas to condemn the hypocrisy of "Columbus Day"  celebrations, people are asked to organize  protests at the embassies of these nations.  'MimmiHiHin iftm  KINESIS    87 Oct Women's Congress  focus on peace  by Suzanne Dahlin and Donalda Vi-  aud  From June 23rd to June 27th over  2,800 women representing 154 countries  from around the world convened in Moscow  around the theme, Toward the Year 2000—  Without Nuclear Weapons, for Peace,  Equality, Development. It was the largest  gathering of women since the historic  women's meeting held in Nairobi, Kenya in  1985 signifying the end of the United Nations declared "Decade of Women". This  World Congress of Women focussed on  the Forward-Looking Strategies adopted in  Nairobi as part of its agenda.  The Women's International Democratic  Federation, the largest non-governmental  organization of women attached to the  United Nations, convened the Congress  which was organized in Canada by the  Congress of Canadian Women and La  Lingue des Femmes des Quebec.  The Canadian delegation was comprised  of three major component groups: Native women, French Canadian and English  speaking Canadians from across the country and representing a variety of labour,  women's, peace, church and professional  groups. The seventeen delegates from B.C.  included three native representatives and  special guest, Rosemary Brown, a former  MLA from B.C.  The opening ceremony held in the Palace  of Congresses in the Kremlin was addressed  by Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union. It reflected a colourful multicultural, international mixing of women of  all colours and races clothed in their national dress, all appearing different but  united in their struggle for Peace.  This ceremony featured children displaying the first in a series of colourful,,hand  crafted peace banners embossed with signatures of children world-wide.  The ceremony culminated in a dramatic  reading of war poems by children from various countries, eliciting a hushed and tearful response from the audience. This set the  stage for the work of the Commissions which  was to follow.  The following four days were hectic as our  work covered formal discussions, which included women for peace and disarmament,  women in society, women and work, women,  children and families, women's involvement  in the struggle for national liberation, independence and self-determination, problems  of development and women, mass media and  women, and the role of co-operation of non  governmental organizations (NGO) in implementing the Forward-Looking Strategies  adopted in Nairobi.  In addition, a number of smaller workshops took place which included: hearings  on violations of women's rights, women and  socialism, meetings of trade union women,  young women and religious women  The Trade Union Women's Commission  dealt with the right to work and equal conditions in the field of employment, guarantees of the right to free choice of the kind of  work, advancement, equal pay for work of  equal value.  The trade union women echoed the rights  to education and health protection. Reports  were given on conditions of part-time workers, home workers, migrants, and women in  agriculture.  Delegates were able to gain a better understanding of the situation and problems  of many countries. Women spoke of laws  introduced aimed at eliminating the obstacles against full and equal participation of  women, but many times delegates said the  laws are not being enforced.  The importance of peace was a major  theme of the Congress and expressed itself in an intense dialogue between women  from the United States and women from the  Soviet Union, a bilateral meeting that extended well beyond the midnight hour and  continued into the following day.  Also present was Dr. Helen Caldicott, (familiar to many from the film "If You Love  This Planet") who proffered a spontaneous  discussion and showing of her new film. Perhaps the greatest peace manifestation was a  massive peace march through the streets of  Moscow to Gorky Park.  The march saw a colourful throng of  women marching under banners, singing,  holding arms, flying balloons and exchanging buttons, smiles and hardshakes with the  many Soviet citizens who lined the streets.  Every night of the Congress featured an  expression of solidarity; solidarity with the  women of South Africa, solidarity with the  women of the Middle East, and solidarity  with the women of Latin America. These  evenings were a social, political and cultural mix of speeches, songs, dances and  general camaraderie. When the formal part  of the evenings ended, many women stayed  on buoyed by music and song.  An especially talented and vocal delegation were the women from Ireland, a group  of feisty women representing both the North  and South of Ireland, who came as a united  delegation, a historical first.  Another expression of solidarity was the  solidarity bazaar. Where else could one purchase madly and all for a good cause, but  at an international display of goods contributed by the delegates and sold at a  bazaar with proceeds going to offset the expenses of the Congress. This was buying  with a conscience.  As if all of the organized meetings were  not enough, the Canadian delegation seized  on the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with the women of South Africa, the  Soviet Union, El Salvador, Palestine and  the United States. This allowed the Canadians to informally discuss with their counterparts in these countries to find ways of  exchange and support.  An especially poignant moment occurred  when Darleen Watts, a native delegate from  B.C. representing the Sechelt Band of Port  Alberni, presented a gift to Ruth Mom-  pathi, a delegate from the African National Congress. Her gift was a print entitled  "Ancient Knowledge" by Joe David of the  Clayquot Band. Watts explained that proceeds from the sale of prints were being used  by the native people on B.C.'s coast in their  Meares Island land claims case. She spoke  of their struggle for self-determination and  Indian self-government, offering her support  for the blacks of South Africa in their common struggle for independence and self determination.  The closing ceremonies which were scheduled for 10 am. sharp on June 27th were  fast approaching. Could the finale possibly  compare to the opening? Setting out with  new found friends, exchanging addresses  and experiences, we boarded the buses en  route to the Palace of Congresses. The closing concert featured a sampling of such  greats as the Bolshoi Ballet, the Moscow  Radio Symphony and Ludwilla Zykdia, a  world-renowned soloist.  Hundreds of children representing the  fifteen Republics of the USSR, ranging  from age three to fifteen years, danced  and sang (surrounded by the likes of Angela Davies, Margaret Papandreau, Sally  Tambo, Valentina Terashkora) and was followed by an address by Robert Mugabe,  Prime Minister of Zimbabwe and leader of  the non-aligned nations.  We headed home the following day, not  with a brief case full of resolutions as expected, but with a feeling of being totally rejuvenated and empowered. The camaraderie we shared with so many different women focussed on our similarities as  women all recognizing the need to rid the  world of war.  Women realized that we are not alone  and isolated; 2,800 women from around the  world, representing organizations of millions told us that the future was surely ours.  United we could certainly end the arms race  and focus our tremendous energies and re-  > on meeting people's needs.  ) KINESIS //////////////////////^^^^  /////////////////^^^^  LIFE STORIES  Working for nothing  by Nora Randall  The week Buy Low had blueberries on for  $1.39 a small basket, I went out to the blueberry fields with the Canadian Farm Workers Union. We were about five miles from  the Buy Low.  Our objective was to force the farmer into  using a scale (prescribed by law) to weigh  the berries. He was paying $4 a bucket and  making pickers fill them to the top. The legal minimum set by the Employment Standards Act is 21.5 cents per pound, which  means that there should have been eighteen  and a half pounds of blueberries in the buckets. From what the pickers told them, the  union was sure the buckets held well over  twenty pounds.  The union talked it over and decided that  the way to approach the problem was to get  a scale at the farm. You can't just walk in  with a scale though. You have to lay the  ground work. Four women who were working for the union during the summer, agreed  to go to work on the farm.  So at 7:30 Monday morning they showed  up at the farm and gave their names as  Surgit, Gurmeet, Rajinder, and Harjinder.  They were given cards to have punched  when they brought the berries up. For two  days they picked blueberries from 7:30 am  to 4 pm. They managed to pick about three  buckets each in this time and they were  picking about an average amount.Rajinder  says that a fast worker could maybe pick five  buckets in that time tops, but she doubts  that much.  While they were picking and eating lunch  the women were able to talk to the other  workers and make sure that the berries were  not being weighed and that the buckets held  a lot more than the eighteen and a half  pounds that would be the right amount for  $4 a bucket. They had to be careful who  they talked to because some of the people in  the field are chumpchas—relatives of the  farmer or just people who keep an eye on  the pickers and report to the farmer. Surjit thinks about twenty to forty of the 250  workers in this field could be relatives of the  farmer.  During their lunch break on the first day  they went back to their car and a group of  young men who were relatives were standing  leaning on their car staring at them. Surjit  says in their culture guys just don't do that.  It's disrespectful. It's not done. It's considered a sexual advance.  Later in the day they came around to  where the women were picking and stared  at them, whistling and singing songs. Harjinder complained to one of the women relatives of the farmer. Harjinder said they were  there to work, not to flirt. The woman yelled  at the boys to stay away from the girls. This  was before she knew they were from the  union. She thought they were good workers  and when they brought their berries up she  even told them they were doing an excellent  job.  by a union worker carrying a scale in a  box, followed by the rest of us. We got out  to where the berries were being accepted  by the farmer and Sarwan got on his bullhorn and told the pickers that we were from  the Canadian Farmworkers Union and that  there had been a complaint against this  farm because there was no scale.  Sarwan told them it was against the law  for the farmer to be taking berries without weighing them. He said the union had  brought a scale and anyone who wanted to  could bring their berries up and the union  would weigh them.  All hell broke loose. Sarwan was immediately surrounded by three women who were  yelling at him. The farmer came hustling up  and told the people to go back to work. He  started yelling at Sarwan. The young male  relatives started drifting out of the fields  and climbing up on the flat bed truck behind the union people. They acted like they  were ready to spring at a moments notice.  Meanwhile Surjit, Rajinder, Harjinder  and Gurmeet had picked up their buckets  and started for the scales, urging others to  do the same. No one else followed them.  They were all standing totally still in the  fields waiting to see what would happen.  Sarwan tried to talk on the bull horn again  and the farmer tried to grab it out of his  hands. All this is going on in Punjabi, a language which at this point, I would give my  Once in the car the women are shaking,  talking about the filthy names they have been  called? In a culture where it is considered lewd  to stare they have been subiected to forty-five  minutes of sexual name calling.  Being very careful, over the two days the  women got a chance to talk to some of  the workers about conditions on the farm.  Some agreed that if a scale was brought they  would take their berries up to be weighed.  Meanwhile back at the union office, workers were phoning up supporters and asking  them if they could come on Wednesday and  go out into the field when the union took  the scale in. When I was phoned I readily  agreed.  I had gone out into the fields with the  union the summer before leafietting about  the unemployment cutbacks and I really  liked it. This year was a little different. The  union wanted a lot of people because they  figured the more people there were the more  pressure there would be on the farmer to  let the berries be weighed. Also, with outsiders there the union was hoping the farmer  wouldn't try anything too outrageous.  We went out to the farm in four cars  which we parked at the edge of the field.  Then we trekked along a sawdust road that  had been built up into the centre of the  blueberry field.

So whenever  there's a little break in the action I pump  one of the union worker's for a translation  of the proceedings.  The four women manage to reach the  road with their buckets and the union  worker weighs them. Three of them weigh  twenty-seven pounds and one of them  weighs twenty-nine pounds. At this point  the three screaming women descend on Surjit, Rajinder, Harjinder and Gurmeet. The  male relatives take their buckets and dump  their berries into the bins.  Sarwan tells the people in the fields that  the buckets hold between twenty-seven and  twenty-nine pounds when they are full and  they are only being paid for eighteen and a  half pounds. He says the farmer is cheating  them out of a third of their pay on every  bucket. He says the law is behind the workers on this. They have a right to have their  berries weighed.  Surjit, Rajinder, Gurmeet and Harjinder  are now trying to get their cards punched  for the berries that have already been  dumped. The card puncher says no. Sarwan gets on the bull horn and tells the  pickers that the puncher is refusing to pay  these women for the berries they picked this  morning. The puncher stamps over and angrily punches the women's cards and shouts  into the fields that they will be paid for what  they picked but they better not try to come  back to the fields.  One of the women relatives is now threatening Surjit with a pair of huge scissors.  Union members move closer around her.  Another one of the screaming relatives turns  to me and says in perfectly good English  that these women have accused her son of  sexual advances. She is outraged.  The farmer is shouting into the fields.  Sarwan is talking through the bull horn.  The three women relatives are yelling in  faces of the four women union workers. Out  in the field two hundred and fifty workers  stand by their bushes watching to see what  will happen. They do not go back to work  like the farmer tells them, but they do not  come forward to have their berries weighed  either. Finally Sarwan tells the pickers that  the union is'going now but that it is going to  file a complaint with the Labour Standards  Board and the farm will be investigated.  We trudge back to our cars, stopping on  the way to take a picture of the empty pesticide containers piled in the ditch next to  where the pickers come to drink water from  a pipe. The four women come with us because they are no longer safe in that field.  Once in the car the women are shaking,  talking about the filthy names they have  been called. In a culture where it is considered lewd to stare they have been subjected  to forty-five minutes of sexual name calling. They are dumfounded. Gurmeet says,  "I have never ever been spoken to like that  in my life, and I don't even know what I  did." Surjit says, "They're like mad dogs.  We were there defending human rights and  they treated us like loose women."  Back at the union office, we have lunch  and talk. The women are still trying to recover from their experience.  One man goe3 off to find the form for an  Employment Standards complaint, another  sits down to do some figuring. I am full of  questions. If the people in the field know  they're being cheated why don't they bring  their buckets to be weighed. They're afraid,  Fm told. Maybe the farmer will weigh their  berries but then say don't come back. But  if this farm is so bad why don't they go to  another farm.  This is a big farm, Pm told. It  antee the pickers enough work so they'll  qualify for unemployment. Very few of the  farms are that big. What does the Indo-  Canadian community think about this kind  of exploitation? Surjit says, it's just like  anything else, the people who can give lots  of money to the temple and can participate  in the events, those are the people with the  power. The farmer is on the board of the  temple.  The man has finished his figuring. Since  250 workers pick an average of five buckets  a day, and each bucket they pick has an average of eight pounds not paid for, than at  21.5 cents a pound the farmer is cheating the  pickers of $2,150 a day or $90,300 over the  season. Rajinder calls it his cheating profit.  The pickers will make on an average $20 a  day or $3,360 over the six week  A month and a half later when I check  to see what's happened, I find out that the  Employment Standards inspector went out  to the farm and was chased off. He went  back with three other men from Employment Standards and a policeman and they  were allowed to weigh the berries. They are  now trying to examine the farmer's books to  see what the picker's were paid. He says his  sister's brother's wife, who does the books,  has had a baby and the books aren't ready.  Surjit, Gurmeet, Rajinder and Harjinder  have not been paid yet. When union workers go to talk to pickers now, the pickers already know what the union tried to do at  the farm. Rajinder says there's a rumour  that he has a scale now, but the pickers are  afraid to use it because they'll get thrown  off the farm. What will it take, I ask the four  women. Continual education by the union,  they say. We have to be there over and over.  It will take time.  You can be there the next time. Call the  Canadian Farmworkers Union, 430-6055,  and get on their supporters list.  KINESIS  '87 Oct.  11 Gloria    Anzaldua:  by Kim Irving  "I write with the tint of my blood"  Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza  by Gloria Anzaldua  Spinster/Aunt Lute Press  1987, $8.95 U.S.  Borderlands. Frontier. Edge. Limit. Margin. "A vague intermediate state or region".* An existence "wherever two or more cultures edge each other, where different races occupy the same territory, where under, lower, middle class touch,  where space between two individuals shrink with intimacy."**  Born in Hidalgo county along the Texas/Mexico border of the lower Rio Grande, Gloria Anzaldua has continued her exploration of her Chicano/Indio roots and her feminism-  lesbianism with her new book Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza.  After completing studies at the University of Texas in 1977 Anzaldua moved to San  Francisco to further her desire to write. Although she left the Bay area to teach on the  East coast for a few years, Anzaldua can be considered a local Bay area writer now settled  in Oakland. She is perhaps best known for her contributions and co-editing of the 1981  publication This Bridge Called My Back—Writings by Radical Women of Color  (Kitchen Table Press, Ed. by Cherne Moraga, Gloria Anzaldua).  Growing up along the border where the lives of Chicano-Mexicano-Indio-Latino mingle  with "cultural ambiguity"; "where the Third World grates against the First and bleeds";  an area of land that Ronald Reagan refers to as the "war zone"; Anzaldua has composed  a moving account of being a part of this "intimate terrorism".  Anzaldua begins her search by tracing her Indio—the "Aztecs of the North"—heritage.  The Indios are some of the oldest inhabitants in what is now the United States. At one  time Indio land was a part of Mexico but as a result of the 1846 U.S.- Mexico war, Mexico  lost almost half of its territory to the U.S. The people caught in-between became known  as the Tex/Mex's.  The past decades flood of migrants across this border, Anzaldua suggests, is the peoples  rightful return to their native land. These wanderers have become some of the poorest and  most exploited people in the U.S. 'Las Mojadas', the Chicana/Mexicana woman, is perhaps  the most repressed. As Anzaldua writes, "this is her home, this thin edge of barbed wire".  Anzaldua relates how she has had to come to terms with aspects of her male-defined,  homophobic, church-related culture. "Not me sold out my people" she writes, "but they  me". Through this search she has unearthed a new culture, "una cultura mestiza" using in  the construction her "own bricks and mortar and feminist architecture".  Anzaldua traces the Azteca/Mexica goddesses who, for too long, have been buried by  male-domination. In her pursuit of the "serpent" (or the "serpents" pursuit of her), she narrates her entrance into the Coatlicue State. Coatlicue, the "serpent skirt", is the goddess  of fertility and mother earth, "like Medusa, a symbol of the fusions of the opposites, life  and death, mobility and immobility, beauty and horror." This state, Anzaldua advises, is a  necessary maze before one can reach the desired state of fusion, a merging of cultures, the  obliteration of the borderlands. The New Mestiza are those who work actively towards this  goal, some are already apparent in feminist, lesbian/gay and people of colour movements.  Escribo con la tinta de mi sangre (I write with the tint of my blood).  Knowing only too well the risks women of colour take in writing and being published,  Anzaldua details her struggle and her need to write and records the conflicting voices which  tell her she shouldn't write. Borderlands is interwoven with Anzaldiia's miscible of language: Chicano, Spanish, Pachuo, Tex/Mex and English. The reader can't help but become involved in the tug-of-war between these cultures. And for white women, especially  non-Spanish speaking white women, Borderlands is a lesson in patience, learning and understanding.  The second half of Borderlands is dedicated to Anzaldiia's poetry, most of which was  written before the essays. Yet, one can feel the connection between the two. The essays  bringing forth the analysis, the poetry, the emotions. The determination and strength she  has gained through her quest crosses over into her poetry.  The message in Borderlands for feminists (and all political movements) is not only one  of merging of cultures but also of merging politics. Anzaldua demands tolerance—tolerance  for the contradictions between white women, between women of colour, and between white  women and women of colour. It, hopefully, reflects a new growth in feminism ... a mestiza  feminism.  * Webster New Collegiate Dictionary.  **Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza.  by Kim Irving  Kim: I'm curious, when I met you at  the book reading and I asked you for an  interview you said that you loved interviews.  Why do you love interviews?  Gloria: I think it's because it's so rare  that we listen to each other. The interviewee and the interviewer are sort of like a  captive audience. I like to do one on one  talks because I think a lot gets communicated. Communicating is part of writing, is  a part of life.  Kim: Was your lesbianism a political  formation? Or biological?  Gloria: For me, it was political but it was  also physical. I went through puberty at an  early age, so I had a whole lot of negative stuff about my body. The bleeding and  the cramps and my culture is very negative  about women's sexuality. My mother, like  most Chicana/Mexicana women, doesn't  have a high regard for men's sexual acts, so  everything in my culture told me that having intercourse with men was not all it was  said to be.  My body made me feel that I was different. So I started identifying not with the  norm but with what was not the norm.  When I grew into the political consciousness, it reinforced what my body and my  emotions had gone through. In Borderlands I say that for some people it's biological and for other people it's a choice. I said  for me it was a choice, but I'm beginning to  think it's a little bit of everything.  Kim: Within the feminist community  Bridge has been very successful and I believe a timely book. How does that success feel?  Gloria: It has sold about 42,000 copies,  as far as I know. I feel good about Bridge,  not because I co-edited it or because I have  essays in it, but because it gave women of  colour a chance to feel like we were a group,  that we were connected to each other in  some fundamental way.  For a long time we had all these feelings  and have not been able to articulate them.  Or if we were able to articulate them, we  couldn't get our work published. All of a  sudden here was a vehicle for our voice, a  bridge. Black, Asian, Native American, Chi-  cana, Latina women—the book feels like a  collective effort. I rank these efforts higher  then I do the individual act, though both  have their place.  Kim: Who do you think is your audience? Latina, Chicana, white women?  Who are your readers?  Gloria: My audience is all the people who  live in the borderlands. Primarily feminists,  women of colour, lesbians. I also want to  send my voice to men of colour—Indians,  Chicanos, Blacks, Latinos—anyone that has  a political consciousness or a feminist consciousness. My audience has always been  these diverse groups.  When I was writing "A Sea of Cabbages"  I thought of all those old men, the women  and children who work in the fields. When  I was writing "Yo no fui, fue Tete" a poem  written in Tex/Mex I was thinking of all  the Chicano faggots. I wrote "Companera,  cuando amabamos" specifically for Latina  lesbians. When I did "Interface" I thought  of lesbians that are spiritual and of lesbians  that are considered sexually incorrect.  And when I was writing the essay "Atrav-  esando Fronteras/Crossing Borders" I was  addressing the people who are forced (or  choose) to cross cultural, sexual, spiritual  borders and who inhabit a world that overlaps various others, specifically Chicanos  and Mexicanos. I wanted that essay to be a  teaching tool. To give a history of the Chicana. We need to understand each other's  history. A lot of people don't know our experiences and what they do know has been  mis-documented, fictionalized.  So, I intended the book to be an introduction not to the, but to one of the Chicano experiences. I wanted to present ourselves because we have been stripped of our  history but also to introduce us to other ethnic people in the borderlands. And the dominant culture. If it gets that far.  "The   central  image is the  borderland,  a place of  contradiction,  confusion ..."  Kim: What led up to the writing of  Borderlands?  Gloria: Around '82-'83 I was writing an  autobiography which turned into a 360 page  manuscript. I had to write it in order to  come in terms with my life and my experiences. So this was a work-up towards Borderlands. Borderlands is keeping in the  middle, going back to my Spanish and Indian history and then coming out at the  other side, formulating some kind of political, psychological theory.  I see a picture of this vertical progression.  At the roots is the cultural history of the Indio and Mexicano and the ground is my personal experience—the things that happen in  my life. Up in the air is the head stuff, the  thoughts connecting all these experiences,  the sky stuff, spirituality. The whole picture  shows the integration and the synthesis that  I have been struggling towards.  Kim: How do you accomplish your  writing? For instance on Borderlands.  Gloria: Before I get into the actual physical writing I have to have a metaphor, a picture or a symbol of an idea or feeling. The  essay that I'm working on now for Sinister Wisdom begins with the image of rocks  falling from a cliff. The essay is about how  we hurt each other—how women of colour,  Chicanas fight amongst ourselves.  The central image for my latest book is  this borderland, a place of contradiction,  confusion, a place that is uncomfortable.  In the book and in my life, I struggle to  take the destructive elements and turn them  around, use them as a jumping board towards growth.  Kim: Do you feel over-exposed from  your writing?  Gloria: Yes, but first I have to confess  things to myself. I do hide things from myself. Things that I don't want to face. As  soon as I reveal them to myself, I can reveal them to others. The hard thing for me  is to "fess up to myself." To admit certain  things. There are things that I have admitted to myself that are not in the book because you can't put all of your life into just  one book.  Kim: Why do you write?  Gloria: The original impetus stemmed  from feelings of extreme alienation from myself, because of my body and from others,  because I was a Mexican woman from the  sticks. I was a ranchera (ranchera: Tex-  Mex and/or Migrant workers who live in the  country and farm. The word has negative  connotations.)  Kim: Because of your body ... ?  Gloria: I started bleeding when I was  three months old. I went through puberty  very early. I was about six when I started  having breasts and pubic hair. It made me  feel very alienated and isolated.  So what avenues do I have? Some kind of  art or some kind of teaching. I feel I have to  write just to stay alive or the tension would  eat me up. So, I write and I write and I  write.  Kim: In Borderlands you talk about  the 'dangers' Third World writers face,  dangers that white women don't face.  What are some of these dangers? And  how do you overcome them?  Gloria: I may have been talking about  psychological dangers ...  Kim: Barriers?  Gloria: Barriers. One of them is going  against the injunction not to write. If you're  a woman of colour you do not have access to words. Words, publishing, means  having power. Writing is going against the  negation. There's always a counter pressure  against it. So whenever you start breaking  laws, rules, it becomes very scary because  you know in some way you are going to be  punished. You start feeling like a deer out  in the forest waiting for the hunter to raise  the rifle and shoot.  In our cultures there are certain things  that we are told not to tell other cultures.  These kind of pressures from within insist "You can't honestly communicate because you're revealing some of the culture  secrets." And the white culture says, "You  can't publish because you don't have anything to say." So you're out on a limb.  But I think the other side of that coin  is the more you expose of yourself, the  more vulnerable to certain things you become, the more honest you are. There's a  strength behind that. So to me, mouthing  platitudes, writing in stereotypical ways, repeating what others have already written, is  not risking. There is no danger in that. The  danger is in risking.  Kim: Then what do you do to protect  yourself?  Gloria: (laughter) I'd like somebody to  tell me! I think that for me, now, when I  know—okay, I'm taking a risk ... I'm taking a risk and exposing this experience of  myself, my ideas. I can get shot down by  whatever culture. The dyke culture because  maybe I'm not subscribing to lesbian theories or whatever, the Chicana culture because I'm betraying the culture by writing  about it, the white culture because I'm so  critical of it ... so I'm sort of naked out  there.  Self-awareness creates a sort of self-  protection. Knowing this is where I am, this  is what may happen to me—to be forewarned. Fear comes from ignorance. If you  don't know, you can't protect yourself.  Gloria: I think what I do with it is fuel my  writing (laughter). I'm a very angry person.  Most of my life I've been very, very angry.  And I think most women of colour are very,  very angry. Most lesbians are very, very angry-  At this Refuse and Resist conference in  New York City this woman said, "The sixties women were very aggressive and out  there. In the seventies women were angry  and in the eighties women weren't angry"  and I yelled "What? ... I'm angry!" I said  "You're talking about some kind of straight  white middle-class unaware woman because lesbians are angry! Women of  colour are angry! We're really angry!  One of the positive aspects of anger is  the work that has come out of it. We have  built organizations, we've done art and writing and political acts so that anger doesn't  turn back on itself. One of the dangers of  anger is that it turns inward. We are feeling  that right now. We, women of colour, are  using anger against each other. Against our  lovers. Against our friends. Another Chicana. Another norteamericana. Instead of  saying okay these are the forces that oppose  us. This is the enemy—lets direct our anger  out there and not at ourselves.  "... mouthing  platitudes,  writing   in  stereotypical  ways,repeating  what others have  already written,  is not risking."  Kim: At the same time a lot of  women of colour have pulled out of  the white feminist movement, burnt and  angry. But you've written some about  why you've stayed and I'm wondering—  why have you stayed?  Gloria: For me, I was never in the white  women's movement because I came into  feminism late and I came in as a person of colour. I was first politicized around  race and the farmworkers movement and  the Chicano movement. Then the white  women's movement opened my eyes to the  oppression of all women.  One of the reasons I have not excluded white women is because I like most  white women. Another reason is that white  women had nothing to do with my growing up. I was not around white women until  I went to graduate school. So I could take  them for what they were. I had no illusions  nor expectations and hence not too many  disappointments.  White women respond to me by opening  up to me. And, yes they have very racist  ways and I get hurt, but often between us  there's a lot of empathy. It's their heads that  I have quarrels with.  Kim: In Canada there has been  some discussion coming from women  of colour questioning the role of white  women editing/publishing women of  colour writing. Has there been much of  that discussion in San Francisco?  Gloria: It's a very hot topic. Women of  colour feel that there are white women that  exploit us. White women are ripping off  the images of Third World women. They  are ripping off our spirituality, our artifacts.  They are going to our pow-wows, our rituals.  Most white women in positions of power  or in positions to help women of colour may  help us, but it is usually out of some kind  of race or class guilt. It makes them feel  psychologically and politically 'good' about  themselves and it raises their status among  friends and their community. Very few white  women help promote our work or publish  us because they really care about our work.  My editor and publisher, Joan Pinkvoss, is  one of the women who really cares. She has  never tampered with my style, my language  or my content.  Kim: So who is the New Mestiza?  Gloria: The New Mestiza is us. Lesbians, women of colour, feminists, all who  have crossed into someone else's culture. For  example you, crossing over to the Mexican  culture—the women of colour culture. So in  your head you're getting all these images  that are not from your culture. You become  sort of a hybridized creature. With a little  bit of this and a little bit of that.  What happens in the consciousness of the  person being grafted—different things are  grafted to her, different cultures, different  ideas—her consciousness starts operating in  a different way. Something happens to the  way she perceives the world and the way  she thinks of herself. That new way is what  I call the New Mestiza Consciousness. A  new way of thinking and perceiving.  The New Mestiza cannot plead ignorance and cannot deny what she sees. She  has to make some sense of it. She's not  closed off to things. In part, this consciousness has been forced onto her and in part  she has chosen it.  "The New Mestiza  ... can not deny  what she  sees.  She has to make  some sense of h."  Kim: What role does spirituality have  in your life ?  Gloria: First of all, I want to define it. I  think for me it's a composite of everything  in me. In terms of racial entities, my spirituality is a sort of syncretic composite of the  new world and the old world. The Indian  of this continent and the white European.  Paganism is at the base of my spirituality.  I have a different explanation for the Spirit  World, for the forces of Nature and the Magical World than most people of colour.  I think that most people of colour do see  that there are two realities; the reality of  the Spirit World and that of this physical  world. I see the Spirit World and the physical world and this bridge across the two.  This bridge is the human imagination.  One of the beliefs in Shamanism is that a  person can change her shape—I could turn  into a coyote, a wolf. Most people in Indian culture or Chicano culture think this  happens physically. For me it happens psychologically. And because it happens psychologically, it happens physically because  what happens in the psyche later happens  in 'real' life. What was the question again?  I was going to define my spirituality?  Kim: Define it and how you apply it  to your own life.  Gloria: Well today, I went to the Berkeley  pier. I needed to talk to Temaya. She's a  Yuroban goddess of the sea. I just got talking to her in my head and said "I'm real confused. I need some clarity. I need a cleansing".  And when I'm home I'll sometimes burn  incense or a candle and talk to La Virgin  de Guadalupe who to me is symbolized by  the serpent. You see her in my room—on  my computer and my alter. She's in my inner world, in my fantasies and imaginings.  She connects everything for me.  Everything for me has meaning. Everything is interconnected. Spirituality and being spiritual means to be aware of the interconnections between things.  graphic from Crazy Horse Spirit  2KINESIS  KINESIS  87 C Treeplanting: some freedom,  some money,  some hard times  by Leslie Kenny  Every year, in the spring time, thousands of women around B.C. drop what  they're doing and head for the hills. Boots'  and shovels in hand, they pitch their tents  in creek beds and grassy meadows. What's  their game? Planting trees.  They do it for the money, they do it  for the sense of freedom it gives. For most  women, treeplanting offers a kind of personal fulfillment that is seldom realized in  more traditional female occupations.  On a treeplanting job, your workplace is  the wilderness. Long days spent climbing  around the rock and debris left behind by  loggers puts one in close communion with  the natural elements that sustain us. Many  planters place a lot of value on this connection to the earth. For others, the chief attraction is the level of physical strength and  endurance that is gained. It gives women a  great sense of balance and well-being that  keeps us coming back year after year. If  asked, most planters would probably echo  this woman's assessment of the job:  "I grabbed the chance to work outdoors. I  don't enjoy the actual work, but I like being  physically strong, and I like the lifestyle."  On the downside, any potential tree-  planter should be aware that the labour  history of reforestation has been particularly grim. Over the years, planters have  born more than their share of low wages,  non-payment, and dangerous working conditions. Slowly the industry is beginning to  turn itself around, but it remains a job in  which there are few guarantees.  Even in spite of the risks women ought to  pay close attention to reforestation. For one  thing, planting trees in the logged-out valleys of B.C. is labour intensive; as well, it is  targeted by both the public and private sectors as a growth industry. This means jobs,  and high-paying ones at that. From 1986 to  1987 alone, the number of seedlings designated for planting in B.C. increased by sixty  percent from 125 to 200 million. This rate  of production, which creates seasonal employment for some 10,000 to 12,000 people,  is slated to continue into the 1990's.  Equally significant is the accessibility of  reforestation for women. Unlike other sectors of the forest industry which are more  mechanized, and more unionized, women  have always formed a sizable minority of the  treeplanting population.  Treeplanting work is heavy and strenuous, yet it is generally recognized that  women and men are equally capable of doing it. Whether or not an individual can  handle treeplanting is reliant on a kind of  'inner stamina' that is not easily detectable  from outward appearances. For example,  one woman, who-recently finished planting  her first season, was quite surprised at the  number of "old-timers" on the crew.  "One woman was sixty-five years old.  And another was about sixty. It was inspiring to see them still at it, and doing a good  job too, because I was thinking I was too  old for it."  So if you're a little out of shape, or a couple of years over the hill, or if you've never  done this kind of thing before, don't get discouraged right away. Many a tall and manly  hunk has been left eating the dust of five  foot housewives.  Most treeplanting in B.C., and as well in  Alberta and Ontario, is performed by private contractors. There are maybe two hundred such outfits in B.C., and employment  is usually secured through contracting one  or more of these directly. By asking around,  you can usually find someone who knows  someone who can get you an interview.  Another approach is to receive some prior  training as a forestry crew worker. In an  attempt to deal with the high rates of  job dissatisfaction and turnover in reforestation, government and industry advocates are presently pouring a lot of money  into training programs for planters that will  enhance their skills and potential for job  development. These courses are available  through community colleges, technical institutes, and through the contractors themselves. It is possible to receive subsidies for  such training if you are on social assistance  or unemployment insurance.  With some good fortune, and a bit of leg  work, any qualified woman could land herself steady employment from early March  until the end of June (in Ontario the season  is shorter, spanning only May and June),  working at a decent wage in a good environment. With a little experience, it is not uncommon to earn upwards of $150 per day.  But be warned: treeplanting is "a hard row  to screef", as we say in the business, and for  women in particular, the hazards abound.  "At first I was idealistic about planting,"  said a veteran of eight years, "the whole  idea of women going about replenishing the  earth. But those trees are so poisoned. So  now it's more of a mechanical job. It's quite  tedious actually. I do it so I can do something else."  What exactly are we up against as women *§>  in the reforestation industry? For some,   §•  it's the wage disparities which are hard-   g-  est to take. There's no minimum wage for   «J  treeplanters. Work is paid at a piece-rate,   a!  meaning that the planter is remunerated on   tu!  the basis of each tree, or twenty-seven cents   §  per tree, depending on the difficulty of the   £  terrain, the type of stock being handled, and  the good-will of your employer. Too often,  the rate per tree is "underbid" and does  not compensate adequately the effort being  made.  Final paycheques are usually not received  until two to six weeks after the last contract,  and they always total less than expected,  due to such deductions as 'camp costs' ($15  to $20 per day), 'quality fines', 'penalties'  for leaving a job early, and 'overcounts'  when trees mysteriously go missing. Many  of these fines are illegal, but treeplanters  have been paying them for so long that few  planters know the difference.  All in all, the uncertainty around the  actual wage bebg earned, combined with  pressure from the contractor to meet ever-  increasing levels of production, causes an  extreme amount of crew rivalry and unco-  operativeness which many women find hard  to endure. Says one long-time planter,  "It's been hard. It never felt like I was  going to be a good enough planter. There  was always this constant nagging to always  do more and more and more. I was made to  feel insecure about my abilities, and I've always resented this."  These types of pressures amount to a  kind of coercion against women planters,  many of whom would rather concentrate on  planting good quality trees than having to  compete with each other for the pay-dirt.  Sinikka Muikkula, one of the only woman  contractors in the province, has this to say:  "I think that women do a better job  than men in quality. They're more conscious  about the job. The trees are planted better, they're screefed and well spaced. I think  men should learn to do the job properly.  The money for treeplanting comes from the  government, so it's everybody's money, and  so quality is very important.*  Aside from earning less money than men,  it becomes immediately apparent upon entering the industry that for women, there  is little room for job advancement. If you're  lucky, you'll work on a crew that is forty  to fifty percent female. But that's as far  as it goes. With very few exceptions all  the decision-makers in reforestation, the  foremen, contractors, foresters, and bureaucrats, are men.  Mostly this is due to women's disadvantages in non-traditional fields of work. But  it speaks also of an active resistance among  women to the power structures. "I have  been given the option of foreing," says one  woman, "But I didn't take it. I'd rather be  the worker." And another explains,  "I saw everything was run by men. I  felt they were running the whole thing. I  felt (like shit), heavily manipulated, totally  alienated. A lot of questions weren't being  answered. They made me foreperson only  because they thought it would shut me up,  like if I could see things from their side I  wouldn't complain so much. But it didn't  work out that way. I could access the hierarchy, but I'm not really interested in developing that side of myself. I'm more interested in humane communication."  For many women, living and working  camps with a lot of men can be a lonely  and isolating experience. One planter advises strongly to "go with another one or  two women if you can, because you'll need  the support."  Be prepared also for a lot of stress upon  your emotional and sexual well-being. If  you're heterosexual and sexually active, get  your birth control together before going into  the bush, because it's a long way to the next  drug store. Interuterine devices (PUD'S) are  out for treeplanting—the stress of packing  thirty to fifty pounds of trees around your  waist all day puts you in danger of a punctured uterus.  Tampons and diaphragms are also risky  due to the tree stock being treated with very  toxic chemicals. As this woman's story indicates, exposure to pesticides in treeplanting  is an urgent concern.  "On one contract, there were a lot ol  nosebleeds. I was getting nosebleeds and  throwing up a lot. Afterwards I went for a  pap smear and it turned out I had severe  displasia (pre-cancer) as a result."  Though always a struggle, the entry ol  women into non-traditional fields carries the  potential for changing those occupations according to feminist values and demands.  Presently, however, the level of women's  consciousness within treeplanting culture  seems quite low.  A review of the numerous studies, reports, and proposals circulated around the  industry show there is virtually no awareness of women's particular needs as forestry  workers.  What could a more 'feminized' workplace mean in treeplanting? Childcare is one  important concern. On site daycare would  make the job more accessible for women  (and men) with children, as well as improving the atmosphere of camp life, for as this  woman notes, "It's nicer for everybody if  there are kids around."  For the 1988 season, the women of Western Reforestation Cooperative, a worker-  run treeplanting business, are planning a  woman-only crew. They are motivated by  a whole range of problems, both inside and  outside of their own co-op, which they perceive to be gender based.  "Even in a so-called 'democratic workplace,"' explains one member of the collective, "we have found it difficult, as women,  to be involved in the really important jobs.  There's always an awkwardness around men  when it comes to learning about chainsaws  and trucks and running contracts. We want  to separate so we can learn in a more trusting environment, but also we can experiment with alternative ways of interacting  with each other, and with the forest."  Indeed, the last word for women in reforestation would be to never forget the forest  for the trees.  For those who desire a stronger role  in addressing problems in forest management, the following organizations  are a good beginning. The Holistic  Forestry Committee is a Vancouver-  based group involved in creating a public demonstration forest in the Seymour Watershed District of North Vancouver. Committee member Dale Edwards welcomes new participants. She  can be reached at 872-4858.  The Pacific Reforestation Worker's  Association (PRWA) is a non-profit  labour organization providing services  and representation to silviculture workers since 1978.

There was more alternative women's theatre in the ten days of the  Fringe than there often is over the rest of the  year in this city. Because the Fringe is not  juried, and any group that can raise $100  registration fee is allowed to participate,  there were many independent low budget  productions. And women's productions are  generally forced into this category, which  means there is fair participation by women  in the Fringe. At least twelve productions  were by women, or were woman-oriented.  Still, out of over 100 different shows, this  number is not overly large.  by Isis  Vancouver Fringe Festival in review  nice voice, but Lovie was the only one of the  three with any feminist consciousness.  Finally Lovie, resplendent in gold lamee  and fishnets, rollerskated on stage. "I just  came back from the over forty baton  twirling championships in Saskatoon," she  explained, launching into a characteristic  tirade about tampons and periods. "If men  had periods, they would be called exclamation marks!"  Lovie was a little low in energy the night  I saw her. It may have been, as she said,  because she was ovulating, or maybe just  the small turnout that evening. And I didn't  recognize much in the way of new material,  Dancing, Clowning, Spinning: Tales  of Bag Ladies and Life  by Ezzell Floranina with guest musicians.  Out of all the Fringe shows I saw, this  one impressed me the most. I didn't want  to write the review because I was one of the  guest musicians, and it is difficult to be critical of something you are part of. But the  show was great. Ezzell is a talented dancer,  singer, actor, signer, stilt-dancer and storyteller. It was something of a one woman performance, with Ezzell describing women's  experience of life, often through her own  life. Her performance was a skillfully woven  story of love, growth, pain, anger, and ultimately joy.  This show is complex. It moved in a spiral, through the different phases of womanhood from the wry old bag lady Dora to  LaLaLove, the playful, impatient child. And  it circled through the four directions, with a  particularly brilliant piece on fire and passion, and what can happen when that passion goes wrong.  although her old stuff is still very funny.  But she still is the best over forty baton  twirler in the feminist or lesbian community,  and she rollerskates and tap dances too (although she is very careful not to fall into  the sink.) However, I would like to see more  new material, a more appropriate choice of  stage partners, and a lot more Lovie. And  maybe David can learn from her that feminists do have a sense of humour.  Preparing written by Beverly Simons,  directed by Keith Digby, and performed by  Jolanta Pyra i3 an encapsulation of one  woman, Jeannie's, life, as defined by her  preparations for significant events. During  the thirty minutes of the play she changes  Scene from The Yellow Wallpaper  The stilt dancing in the air/wind piece  was also wonderful. I had  never seen anyone dance on stilts before,  and as Ezzell danced and sang to the accompaniment of the glass harmonica (glasses  played by rubbing the rim with a wet finger) it seemed the wind herself entered the  venue.  Overall Ezzell's message was one of growing and learning, on a psychic as well as  an emotional level. And this is probably the  only Fringe performance which women at  Lakeside prison will get to see, when she  takes the show there.  Fringe Venue number 5, R.J. Christie's,  is located in the seedy basement of a bar  that features skateboarding of a bar that  features skateboarding male strippers on  Ladies' Night. It was certainly a tacky  enough space for 5 4 3 Unnatural Acts.  I came to see one of my favorite (and  one of the only) local feminist comics, Lovie  Sizzle. But first I had to sit through David  Schendlinger, who, disappointingly, has a  lot to learn about non-oppressive humour.  And I think he knows it. He did have some  good lines, but I can't understand why  Lovie was performing with him. Or for that  matter, why local chanteuse Colleen Savage  shared the biling. Savage has nice clothes  from a rebellious teen to a hardened old  woman, late even for death.  Jeannie is not a particularly likeable  woman, but she is very successful in the  business world, and becomes a snobby matron of the arts by middle age. Early signs  were evident in her teenage longing for control over her own life, but society thwarted  her in many ways, and the road she chooses  forces her to become hard and arrogant.  Actor Pyra uses Jeannie's constant  companions—a vanity, hairbrush, and assorted make-up—to emphasize her physical aging. Pyra does not leave the stage in-  between episodes in Jeannie's growth, and  yet very convincingly ages fifty or sixty  years in a brief half hour. And Pyra skillfully carries Jeannie from preparation to  preparation, keeping the sense that this is  the same woman at different times in her  life.  Preparing did not have any major theme  or message, but the concept of preparation  as a lens through which to view a woman's  changes is interesting.  Care and Control, written by the Gay  Sweatshop/Micheline Wandor, performed  by Vancouver's Dark Horse Theatre Collective is about lesbians and children. The  story is a soap opera-like series of vignettes  detailing the lives of several different couples. Although parts are humorous, the conditions and troubles faced by the different  couples are anything but.  In one scenario two women have become  lovers. One's husband knows and more or  less understands (he has a girlfriend any- j  way) and the other is terrified to tell her «  husband. When she does he assaults her and I  she leaves the kids. The two women decide i  to live together, but the first's "understand- .!  ing" husband insists on keeping their child, !  while the other's husband eventually takes I  her to court to try and obtain custody. The !  verdict, that she can keep the children, is j  surprising; the court makes many references '  to her lesbiansism and therefore her map- '  propriateness as a mother. \  The other stories detail similar situations i  involving children and lesbians, although  the second court case, in a reflection of reality, does not end so well. The father, who  has not even contacted the child or given financial support for over a year, is given custody.  Dark Horse has done a good job of producing a play with a strong political theme,  that of society's persecution of lesbians as  mothers. It does not come off entirely dogmatic, in part I think because of the soap  opera form of the play, and partly because  of the skill with which it has been put together. There are occasional places where  the acting is a little forced, or the dialogue,  but overall Dark Horse has dealt with the  situation with awareness, compassion, and  humour where possible. The characters are  all believable, and the husbands/fathers are  portrayed as developed as humans, albeit  ones who are warped by the patriarchy and  have chosen to be jerks.  I hope Dark Horse intends to perform this  play again, and will be able to reach audiences that are not already aware of the is-  j. sues involved. If they do this, they will have  §• achieved the major goal of political theatre,  =5* raising awareness.  g  | by Karen Shave  £ One excellent show was The Yellow  ° Wallpaper, written by Charlotte Perkins  J Gilman.

Written in 1890,  •§_ the story looks at the effects of a Victorian  marriage on a woman.  The author was oppressed by her own  roles as wife and mother to the point of nervous breakdown. After divorcing her husband and giving up her child, she worked as  a lecturer and writer on feminism until the  1920's.  Scene from Foreign Territory  Gilman reveals that the husbands' treatment of his wife's madness is part of the disease. He is not portrayed as means or domineering but as a paternal figure. He treats  his wife like a little girl.  Melanie Doerr, as the woman, and  Sharon LeBlanc, as director, presented an  excellent adaptation at the Fringe. Melanie  Doerr was very convincing as the woman  undergoing the 'rest cure' ordered by her  husband. In her obsession with the pattern  on her wallpaper Doerr's character comes  closer and closer to the woman she imagines  creeping behind it.  Jack Trewren and Eclectic Studio designed an incredible set. Large sections of  stretching painted fabric allowed dancer  Mary Lou Trinkwon to move gracefully behind the wallpaper and then throw herself against it in cruel contortions. Gilman  would have respected this show.  Very different from The Yellow Wallpaper, Foreign Territory is set in the future.  Written and directed by Jackie Crossland,  Wive's Tales Story Tellers brought Foreign  Territory to the Fringe.  Emma (Melanie Ray) and Margaret (Nan  Gregory) don't get along but learn to tolerate each other through their look at the  moral dilemma of war. Emma, an alcoholi  scientific inventor, has created a defense  mechanism. This mechanism is sold by Margaret's husband, an arms merchant. Margaret takes Emma to the country to 'dry  out' and they end up stranded and having to  get along. The show presented strong ideas  on communication and on the moral responsibility of war. Unfortunately the script  made for some unconvincing dialogue.

We—ten  or so feminist journalists—cornered them,  Jools and Lynda Topp, on the grass outside  the media tent. We kept them there for over  an hour while on the grounds beyond fans  were staking out area by stage #4, where  the Topp Twins would next perform. They  were a hit alright.  Their first time out of the South Pacific,  these New Zealand entertainers greeted  Vancouver audiences with only one acoustic  guitar, two mics, a couple rich voices, some  spoons, and a trunk load of inspiring and  entertaining material.  With an obvious respect for traditional  country and western music (while at the  same time making fun of it a little) the Topp  Twins let go. Thanks to sister Lynda, the  yodel is reborn.  "Yodelling was big in the 1930's and  1950's," she said, "and a lot of those people had peers that they could talk yodelling  with ... In New Zealand I used to go tc  a party and people would say 'what's a yodel?' ... I grew up a very lonely child, yodelling."  One song challenges Dolly Parton—  presumably out in the audience somewhere—to "trot her frame" up on stage for  a grand ole' honkytonk performance. "It's  round up time in the old coral for Dolly and  the twins."  Why country music? "We grew up on it,"  says Jools recalling childhood in the small  New Zealand farming community. "Cows  used to like singing, you see, and so we used  to sing all the time in the cowshed. That  was the only musical training we ever got."  As lesbian performers, Jools and Lynda  have had to fight that much harder to gain  the public's respect, but it's there all right.  Referring to themselves as the "lesbian darlings of New Zealand" Jools tells us of three  awards ("our mother picked up on our behalf") won only a few days earlier: best entertainer, best original music and best TV  program.  Audiences sure like Lynda and Jools.  Their apparent ease and confidence charms  us right up on stage with them and we don't  climb down till the show ends, and then only  reluctantly. There's so much going on in this  two hour introduction to the Topp Twins'  world.  We're taught yodelling; we learn how  'twin' voices can slide together with harmony and precision; we share a few laughs  (often at our own expense) and perhaps  most importantly—we learn about New  Zealand.  There are two Maori songs in the Topp  kSv/records  OCTOPUS EAST  Lynda and Jools Topp  Twins' repertoire, the first a song of welcome; the second, one of courage. Maori  custom asks that all visitors to tribal land  sing their greeting. "Old women welcome  you onto the marae (meeting place) and  after you've spoken, you must sing—saying  you've come in peace, come to wish everyone well and saying where you're from—  your ancestry," says Lynda.  In New Zealand, Jools explains, the  Maori people have retained much of their  culture. "For us, to come from a country  where the native people can get up and sing  ... a chill goes right up your back ... For  us to be able to sing that song is a real privilege."  We learn that New Zealand, an Island  of three million people, is nuclear-free. (We  also learn, during one Vancouver performance in July, that the Labour government  which passed the nuclear-free bill was just  3 re-elected).  ■J "Got No War In My Heart", Jools tell us,  3 is a tribute in song to the New Zealand pec-  jj pie. Another anti-nuclear song, The President's Men" was inspired by the Chernobyl  ^ disaster. It's about a woman who "works in  o a factory where she has to tell lies, about  a. the size of the meltdown and the gas in the  skies."  We also learn that in 1985 New Zealand  passed a homosexual law reform bill, further  breaking down homophobia. "When the  (homosexual law reform) campaign started  up ... what it actually did was present all  the homophobics in New Zealand as angry,  frustrated people ... really horrible," said  Lynda "Whereas all the pro-gay people had  parties in the streets, and yahooed around  ... there was real joy in the fact that something was happening in our community ...  something that we could strive for."  The result of this education within New  Zealand is progressive reform and a growing  nationalist pride. "Everyone goes around  New Zealand thinking wow this is such a  great place to be, how we all love living here,  and that's a nice thing to feel about where  you come from."  Contemporary and traditional New Zealand in song, Topp Twins style. As a Canadian audience we might vacillate between  envy and skepticism (What's going on down  there anyway—paradise!) Or maybe we  just enjoy the sounds of 'twinmusic'.  Well, they found us pretty charming too.  A three day gig at the folk fest turned  into "How I spent my summer vacation in  East Vancouver" for the Topp Twins. And  after getting a whiff of success they even  produced a tape here, No War In My  Heart Disappointing. Ten dollars gets you  some pretty simplistic lyrics—over and over  and over again until you almost start to  forget those two charming women up on  stage. They don't quite make it coming from  the recording studio into our livingroom;  they're not crazy about the studio business  either.  "We are into absolute entertainment,"  3aid Jools. "There are some bands who  haven't even done an audience show. They  just go into recording studios and boomf out  comes a little plastic round bit and they're  famous! That's not entertainment as far as  we're concerned. You've gotta go out and  you've gotta face the crowds."  I think about this and a lot of other  things, out there with Jools and Lynda on  the grass by the media tent. I think—not  bad for a couple of kiwis (Jools' words, not  mine).  Thanks to Vancouver Co-op Radio's  Lesbian Show and Women Do This Everyday for help with this interview.  The Topp Twins will be performing  "Topp Secret"in October at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre.  Dagmar Krause:Interpreting Brecht  by Gail Buente  In the last few years, there has been a  revival of interest in the work of Bertold  Brecht; scholars study him, rock singers  stylize his song lyrics, and serious German  companies respectfully perform his plays.  But, in Dagmar Krause's opinion, these are  not interpretations Brecht would have like.  When the German-born singer was in Vancouver in July for the Folk Festival, she  explained, "A lot of Brecht has been performed just for a certain cultural elite. It's  very highbrow in Germany. But I know that  Brecht isn't highbrow; he didn't want to be.  He is for all of us."  Krause tries to approach it differently.  "I'm not coming to Brecht from the academic approach that many interpreters are  coming from, making it lifeless and putting  it up in some corner where only a cultural  elite identifies with it."  Her album, Supply & Demand, which  was released in both an English and a German version, is a brilliant demonstration of  her attempt to make his work come alive  for today's audiences. Her sensual, stark,  light-and-shadows alto voice is so perfect for  the job that she is considered by many critics to be the world's foremost interpreter of  Brecht's songs. "I hope that in my interpretation, the humanitarian aspect of his work  comes out. I'm not looking at his work as a  kind of museum piece."  Her unorthodox view takes her to concert halls, folk festivals, and nightclubs. "I  do 'new wavish', or new contemporary type  of clubs, where people are interested in a variety of stuff, but it has to be kind of real  rather than just a style. And lots of festivals,  a whole great variety of different venues."  To all these venues she takes an adamant  belief that Brecht has much relevance for  life today. "The times haven't changed that  much from 1930 to 1987. We still have  highly repressive regimes in this world. We  have still too much poverty; there are almost whole continents starving. On many  issues Brecht is still very relevant today."  Krause, with a background that includes  work with two original art-rock bands,  brings a contemporary sensibility to the  1930's proletarian operas Brecht wrote with  1146Commercial:;-' 253-0913  fc\  \foncouver Folk Music Festival <  PRESENTS  AN EVENING OF FEMINEST HUMOUR WITH  Kate Clinton  delightful... sharp... outrageously irreverent!

The angst and alienation Brecht and his  friends felt in the years following World War  I are not so different, she feels, from what  people are feeling today.  "I think as well, people are getting bored  with the packaging in music, with no content. There's a real struggle to find something that will shake us again. I think people are starting to become more interested  in the real article, instead of kind of a 'pretend' that's around for quite a few years  now. Brecht is still new."  And Dagmar Krause is exciting. She was  one of the surprise discoveries for many listeners at the Vancouver Folk Festival this  summer. She says she knows her material  isn't typical folk festival fare. It's not something that they necessarily expected. I think  the response I had was wonderful. I think  it is interesting as well in a festival to have  something that people don't necessarily expect. I think it's a good thing to widen our  horizons or ideas about music."  The singer, who makes her home in  England, will be in Vancouver October 14  through 17 for an exclusive engagement at  the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Opening night tickets are two-for-one. This will  be the only concert she performs in North  America, because her next album, comprising entirely Hanns Eisler tunes, is currently  in production.  , KINESIS Arts  /^s^smsm^ss^sssm^^.  At the movies with queens of protests  by Claire Stannard  MISS...  OR MYTH?  A Gold Mountain Production.  Directed   by   Geoffrey   Dunn   and   Mark  Schwartz.  Assistant director, Claire Rubach.  Produced by Dunn, Schwartz and Rubach.  Documentary-Colour.   Running  Time,   60  minutes.  The Miss California pageant was held in  Santa Cruz annually from 1924 to 1985.  Miss ...  or Myth, a documentary film, is  a record of local protests organized against   —  the pageant, in particular, the 1985 protest   ^  where more than 1000 feminists gathered to   s  demonstrate and witness a unique and pow-    J  erful act of civil disobedience. g  The film is a finely edited juxtaposition   °  of old footage from early pageants (which at   «  times have a surreal quality), news reports ■%,  and present interviews with many people  from both sides of the issue. The filmmakers, Dunn, Rubach and Schwartz, worked  collectively on all aspects of the film.  Although the presumed audience of this  film would identify with the protesters,  equal weight and respect is given to people  for and against the pageant. This balance  and objectivity gives the film a feeling of  integrity. Though we never hear the interviewers' questions, their sensitivity is apparent: the people speaking know they are being listened to and respected, regardless of  whether the interviewers agree with them.  Protest organizer Ann Simonton had  been a successful model for five years when  she was gang-raped at knife point on her  nineteenth birthday as she was on her way  to a job. It is an experience that fuels her  work, one that she thinks of "every day of  my life."  "I want people to understand the connection between violence against women and  objectifying women in pageants," says Simonton in the film. Her methods of showing the connection are confrontational and  impossible to ignore. One year, she and others constructed a float carrying statues of  women and children, contorted in grotesque  scenes of violent pornography. In the 1985  protest, she parodied the bathing suit contest of the pageant by wearing a suit she  had made out of meat, as the group chanted,  "Judge meat, not women."  Efirly demos  focused on  themes of a  beauty  obedience  school and  "weight  slavery."  The pageant officials and contestants react to the demonstrations with bewilderment and disgust. They attempt to discredit  the protesters by citing their lack of femininity and grooming. "Many of them are fat  ..." explains Lisa Davenport, Miss California, 1985, in obvious horror.  The annual protest began in 1979, organized by Nikki Craft, who wanted to "assure that there was another voice ... to  speak out for all the women of California."  Simonton describes the typical winner as a  "thin, white, usually rich, religious barbie  doll ... it's arrogant to think she's representing us—she's not."  From the start, the demos were characterized by an inventive array of political art.  Early demos focused on themes of a beauty  obedience school and "weight slavery".

She brings an unapolo-  getic and profoundly feminist sensibility to  her work, realizing the desire to have her  subject and her audience connect on a visceral level.  Her films examine the place of women in  history and contemporary society. They include Three Photographers, a documentary featuring women photographers working in a male dominated field; Valentine's  Day, a satirical look at American society's  obsession with holidays, traditions and contests; Footbinding, which explores the reasons why women are forced to accept defined standards of beauty across historical  and cultural boundaries; and Night Without Fear, a powerful indictment of the oppression and vulnerability of women embod-  Laurie Meeker at home in her studio.  the present, drawing clear parallels between  old attitudes and prejudices and contemporary western thought.

Simonton admires the bravery of Lisa Davenport  in going public about her bulimia, and Davenport in turn empathizes with Simonton'a  trauma of rape. Miss Maine '84, Lisa Johnson describes the aftermath of a pageant:  "They cattled us, pushed us offstage ...  and the women threw up, crying hysterically, black make-up running down their  faces—it was a horror show."  The film builds toward the dramatic climax of the 1985 protest, a chillingly powerful act of civil disobedience. Simonton and  another protester, Chris Adams, spill their  drawn blood on the steps of the pageant  building while the festivities go on inside.  * They are arrested.  "As a survivor of sexual abuse, symbolically, that's my blood that is being walked  on here," says Adams. "That's my power,  my anger, my life ... I spent twenty years  in silence, five years learning how to speak."  The protesters claim as a partial  tory the fact that after sixty-one years, the  pageant was moved to San Diego in 1986.

She says,  "The pageant deserves all the backing of all ^  the feminist groups around because it is the £•  largest scholarship foundation for women s  in the world." And if the pageants are ex- $  ploitive of women, she says, "Why not? The § I  scholarships are certainly worth ... almost ||  any amount of exploitation."  "We are the original women's lib movement" asserts Sue Stolle, pageant official.  "We're trying very hard to put forth an example of what women can be." She goes  on to cite the pageant's goals for women to  learn to "become good wives and mothers."  Ann Simonton arrested at 1985 protest  This is an inspiring and affirming film.

Ryan wrote all the tunes, and  if you like country, jazz/blues or rock, there  something for you on this tape.  Ryan performs frequently around Vancouver, often with her band Linedriver, or  with the all-women Hen Pals. Unfortunately  there are no cuts by the Hen Pals on this  tape, although Jenny Lee Aire, Linda Hunt  and Terrilyn Pakarynch do harmony vocals.  The cassette has several songs about independence, which Ryan has learned about  over the years. "Who Cares" is a great  jazzy-blue story about a woman who refuses  to wait around for a man. "Wants me to  stay at home, til he calls me on the phone,  Sorry babyno, fraid I hafta go ... I got better things to do than sit here and wait for  you."  Ryan wrote the song when she was stood  up on a date a few years back. "I used to  take it," she said, "but I thought well, forget it, I'll just go out and have fun myself."  One night while performing she was  inspired by someone dancing alone, and  thought  "Why not?" And so "Lone Cat  Terilyn Ryan: independant country music  by Marrianne van Loon  Dancin" was born. "I don't have a partner  but I'm dancin up a storm, you may think  I'm crazy, this is not the norm, but I'm just  having myself a ball." The song speaks to  still people, although it is hard to imagine  anyone so uptight that they can ignore it's  catchy beat.  "Ask me" is the other independent-  minded tune, "That's about jealousy. I try  to treat jealousy lightheartedly," she says.  And it's certainly something you can dance  to. A woman has the right to say no, she  neither has to be defensive nor uptight, that  is just the way it is. "You've got a question  that I've heard before, I'm listenin' but I  won't no more, I just can't stand to hear it  all time and time again, ask me, but I don't  have to tell."  Ryan has also included some traditional  style tunes. "Blue Mountain Skies" is about  love in the pale moonlight with its requisite  flowing skirts and vows of love forever. In  addition to her ability to get down and rock,  Terilyn has a very clear voice which is gently  framed by this slower and quieter song, although the sentiments are too fairytale-like  for my taste.  And "Everytime" is a poppy little number about being in love in its finest cliche-  because-it's-true sense. "Everytime" is the  time she has chosen to release to radio stations, and it's getting air-play.  The other side of love is aptly portrayed  in "No Time For Lovin", a Loretta Lynn  style song where she tells her mate that  she'd love to make love, but she is too busy  doing laundry, washing dishes and caring  for the kids. Like the others, this song is no  doubt a reflection of something Ryan encounters in her own life; she has a family  with two young sons, and a career.  "Something always suffers," she admits.  "Either my mind, or sometimes the family  suffers, or my career. There is no way you  can do it all, it's impossible, there is too  much work."  Despite the heavy demands, she is trying to organize a tour across the country.  "It's hard with two kids," she says. Things  just have to move a little slower. And the  b-side of "Everytime"—"Lookin For Luck"  (also on Silver Bullets) has been picked up  by Toronto's CFGM, the biggest Canadian  country station. And the commercial love  song "Everytime" will become a video in  the near future; Ryan has received a FAC-  TOR/CTL loan to produce it. So things are  moving.  You can pick up copies of Silver Bullet  at local independent record stores, and the  Hen Pals usually play at least once a month  at either the Savoy or the Railway Club in  Vancouver. And Ryan will be playing the  Cariboo with Linedriver at the end of October. If you haven't seen her yet, she's  definitely worth a listen. So get on down  and have yourself a good time dancin' up a  storm.  Feminist mystery set in Vancouver  by Eunice Brooks  FIELD WORK  by Maureen Moore  The Women's Press  Toronto, 1987.  Sometime during the writing of this mystery, Maureen Leyland the literary person  turned into Maureen Moore, the mystery  writer: the one who sets the scene for the  murder of Dr. A. Frampton. The change  isn't remarkable. The writer still gives us  characters with such depth we feel we know  them.  I like Aunt Ruby in Field Work. She  adds nothing to the clues that lead to  the denouement, yet she makes everything  that does happen for the detective, Marsha  Lewis, possible. Aunt Ruby is old, loving,  and she smokes marijuana to help her see  better, so she can type theses to bring in  money, to keep food on the table. Everyone  should have such an aunt.  Marsha Lewis, Moore's detective, is  thirty, a graduate student in urban anthropology, a mother, and has a student assignment to follow two Vancouver detectives  around until they solve a crime, Frampton's  murder. She knows she'll get an A on the assignment. Getting A's is the only surety in  her life.  The tensions begin immediately. Marsha  never has enough money, or time, or street  smarts. The cops are afraid of her, and show  it in antagonism. She thinks of the ten or so  suspects as though they are people. Try as  she may she plays favorites. While the cops  are making every effort to pin the crime on  likely victims, Lewis gets into the lives of  the suspects, actually walks in their shoes.  Page by page, as the clues are strewn  for the reader, there are also questions that  "women ask. One example is: "He thinks  I'm a feminist? That's what bothers him?"  Other issues raised concern unnecessary  surgery, the plight of the child put out for  adoption, women who make a living from  their beauty, homophobia, and to shave or  not to shave legs. Even when the murderer  is in remand, those questions, and others,  float in the mind, at least they did in mine.  The suspects, Lewis discovers, fit into the  statistics she has learned in her studies. The  wife has been made infertile through an illegal abortion wheh she was still engaged  to Dr. Frampton. The doctor's illegitimate  daughter was given up for adoption. The old  flame was not only rejected, but felt that she  had to give up her child, so she could practice nursing. (Back then, nurses had to live  like the angels they represented.) Frampton's receptionist had just revealed that she  was a lesbian, which the doctor took so  badly he tried to fire her. The women who  worked for the health collective were suspected to be using urban guerrilla warfare  on doctors (was Frampton one?) who had  long records of abusing women. There were  patients who felt malpracticed upon, particularly a model who had an eight inch scar  on one of her breasts, which ended her career in modelling. They all hated Frampton.  The cops decide that the craziest of the  suspects must have been the one, so they  spend all their time leaning on the daughter and the women in the health group: all  crazy by a man's definition.  Lewis learns how to get hold of a weapon  in Vancouver, where most criminals learn  to commit their crimes, and that violence  is not usually part of a police person's day.  In this book there are no Mickey Finns,  no brawls, no effective threats, and no police brutality. The only violence is one accurately aimed shot into the victim's chest,  which kills him instantly.  But Lewis is no fumbling Miss Marpole.  She has been a victim in the past, and she is  determined never to be again. Her love for  her child and her studies fill her life well, until she becomes involved with the investiga  tion. She grows throughout the book into a  whole person. Moore knows nothing, if she  doesn't know how to build a character. Day  by day Moore evolves Lewis to the last day  and the murder solution. What Moore is left  with is an enchanting detective the reader  will be waiting to see in action again and  again. Moore has the beginning of a series  here.  I'm not going to tell you that this is the  great Canadian novel. What I will say is  that it is a good five hour read. Also, if the  publishers offered a money back guarantee  of satisfaction, they would still make money.  If you liked Maureen Leyland's short stories,  which have appeared in a variety of anthologies over the past ten years, you'll love the  mystery. The name has changed.

"I kept  saying, 'I think I want to go uh ... sell  muffins in Vancouver.' "  But fifteen years later, the Newfoundlander is still performing. After recently touring her own show Wedding in Texas, she  has returned to working with the revived  Codco theatre company, a central group in  the rich and lively arts community of Newfoundland.  whole gang's going to Vancouver for two  months'. When you're in a gang and you're  a single mother, you're just hoping they  won't say something that's so outrageous  that it's gonna really fuck up your life.''  Being a single parent doesn't seem to  have slowed Jones down. If anything, it has  helped focus her more: "When I first had  Mara I was really poor, but I started getting in gear working on different projects  because I knew I had to come up with the  cash ... so having Mara really motivated  me to work really harder."  And the work has paid off. "From 1982—  having to call my friend on the phone and  say '(sob) Get me a twenty, I gotta get  Cathy Jones and her daughter. Mara  "People (in Newfoundland) are writing their own material constantly; there's  bunch of really strong women writers;  there's a whole new gang coming up ... an  incredible wealth of theatre there and filmmakers and set people ... It's not like we're  all going around coming; it's not a harmonic convergence all the time—people are  also getting loaded and saying fuck off quite  alot. But it's like there's something happening.  "We've stayed there and made our living  for fifteen years and they are coming to us  (Codco) now, the Toronto people and the  Halifax people," says the thirty year old comedian.  It was after a long association with the  Codco "gang" that Jones developed the solo  show that stole the limelight at Toronto's  World Stage Festival in 1986. Lately she  has divided her time between Wedding in  Texas, the Codco group (now developing  television shows), and five year old daughter, Mara.  I sort of like working on my own," she  admits, "because then you get to be more in  control. You don't feel that sense of drowning helplessness when someone says, 'The  some diapers and juice,' to—on the road  this year, I had my paid babysitter actually  travelling with me ... things change fast."  Though utterly irreverent, Cathy Jones  takes a spiritual approach to her work: "I  really did hook into some kind of spiritual  forces when I wrote Wedding in Texas ...  but when I wanted to do the spiritual thing,  the sexual thing always came through because I had so much—and I do have, and  everybody has—so much to work out on the  sexual level. So even though I was trying to  be groovy and guided on my material, a lot  of it is very, very base sexual jokes ...  "I wanted to write about thoughts and  actions and how they make things happen  ... I want to make people realize that they  can project and do what they want.  "I really want to be a healer in some ways,  but they say laughing is really good for you,  so in some way I am. I'm fooling around  with attitudes, breaking through attitudes  and realizing, things are not that serious.  I mean, basically we're just the same ...  some people are homosexual, some people  are in a violent relationship, but nobody's  to be judged on it, nobody's to be judged.  I try to encourage acceptance of people, of  attitudes and what people are into."

Wed. & Thurs.  1034 COMMERCIAL  254-5044  Jones's show certainly introduces a wide  array of characters. All are defended in  uniquely warped ways against the hazards  and heartbreak of modern relationships.  The first half of the show presents a series of  monologues, and a scene where Jones plays  both partners in a violent relationship.  The second half takes the same title as  the whole show. It deals with Jones's favorite topic—relationships. It is the story  (the epic story) of "outport lesbian" Lindy  Anna Jones and her adventures en route  to Texas to attend the wedding of her former lover, Helen. Helen is poised to marry  the sleazy lizard we met earlier in the show  (crooning a tune to "the girlfriend, the wife,  and the woman I love")—"Love" Murphy.  We first meet Lindy in Newfoundland,  engaged in amicable dialogue with her dog,  convincingly embodied by nothing more  than a bark. After warnings from Mom  (who takes the form of Lindy's hand moving  like a mouth)—"Lindy, you'll break your father's heart ... You can't go, you haven't  got any clean clothes ... Lindy, you're not  like other girls"—Lindy sets off in her blue  canvas jeep.  "It's always scary riding in the States at  night, even when you're just pretending,"  says Lindy, rolling down the Texas highway  switching stations on her jeep's radio. (Her  own voice provides the static between stations with names like WOMB and time bulletins like "five to nine on Gertrude Stem".)  And strange things do happen. Lindy encounters weird phenomena at an abandoned  gas station, gets into an accident and finally  is "sucked into the light".  In her life-after-death out-of-body experience, Lindy rescues Helen from the church  and calls home (on what appears to be  heaven's one-way direct line) to Mom who  can't hear what she's saying.  The piece escalates to a frenzied level  of hilarity and special effects, yet lurking below the lighthearted treatment are  less lightweight themes familiar to those  who have braved the terrain of "modern" relationships—love, jealousy, loss, even  death. Jones hopes to expand the Lindy  Anna piece into a film, developing the story  further, "Lindy falls in love with Helen—  maybe when they were feminists, maybe  some time years ago ... they had an affair.  But Lindy was really a lesbian and maybe  Helen was just foolin' around.  "It's a relationship where basically Helen's ... really, she's gay, but like she's not  really gay, she's kind of bisexual, but it really hurts Lindy when it happens because  she really knows she's gay, she's okay on it.  She doesn't have any feelings about men except that she can't stand Love Murphy.  "... I was thinking Lindy could have  a gang of women who hang around on  motorcycles—just gorgeous big amazon  kind of women."  "And then Love Murphy is a very important character to me too, because Helen gets involved with this guy, she's crazy  about him. But he's really ... basically, he  just leaves the whole thing up to her—the  family and stuff.  "I think he comes home one day and  Lindy and Helen would be in bed together  and he'd just, like ... just go really weird,  and just have to deal with all kinds of stuff.  It has the ingredients for Jones's wild humour, but Jones is serious in intent as well:  "I want to have people taking on their problems and their emotions and their blocks  and actually working through them in the  film. I want to show people going through  the process of feeling really shitty when  they're trying to work stuff out and ... you  know, real tension because there's actual  real feelings involved.  "I'm not talking about a flimsy little relationship but something that's really strong,  some strong connection that's really fucking  them all up. I really want to work on that-  you know, the real stuff just comes out  funny sometimes."  Jones doesn't take sides in the sexual  preference arena. "In the whole first part  (of the show) I'm talking about men and all  of a sudden I do this man and then all of  a sudden I do this character who's gay. So  ... whatever I was going through in terms  of not knowing where I was at, is coming  through  Jones thinks the lesbian aspects of the  show are good for people's attitudes, good  for lesbians. "Here's my lesbian character  and everybody really likes this person and  then they realize she's lesbian and then they  just go on lovin' her.  "And they don't ever think anything like  ... like, (I've heard of people—I didn't even  realize it, but) lesbians come up against all  kinds of prejudice for being lesbians, people being real judgmental and weird about  it... But I find a cross-section of the world  loving this woman."  In her work, Jones tries to keep a clear  intention towards her audience: "... each  one of those people deserves a good laugh,  they deserve to be entertained and if you really have a good intention towards them, if  you really do like them, you really try to do  that."  And she tries to keep a balance in herself: "I figure that I have god inside me and  everybody does, so that keeps my attitude  in line about my success ... But it is also  a matter of not blocking yourself and saying 'Jesus, I can't do it,' and instead saying  'I guess I could do it. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do  it.' "  Let's hope Cathy Jones keeps on doing it.  KINESIS    87 Oct. <^^>^^^^^^^^^^^^  ARTS  /N^O>tt£*  V/   '  by Melanie Conn  So far in this column I have only reviewed  science fiction written by women. That's not  because there are no good or interesting SF  books by men. There are, and sometime I  will get around to reviewing a few. But the  supply of SF by women continues to amaze  and absorb me because so much of it is relevant to my own experience and analysis as  a woman and a feminist. So here are three  more books by women, each with something  special to recommend it.  EGALIA'S DAUGHTERS  by Gerd Brantenberg  The Seal Press (Seattle), 1985  $13.95 269 pages  This book really took my breath away.  First published in 1977 in Norwegian, it  was translated into English and published  by Seattle's Seal Press in 1985. The story  concerns a society— Egalia—where sex-  roles are reversed, a favorite SF theme. The  translation is exceptionally fluent considering that the author's portrayal of Egalia  includes a number of "new" words: young  boys are "lordies", husbands are "house-  bounds", and—this is the hardest one—  women and men are "wims" and "men-  wims".  Very few SF writers have had the courage  to create or employ language that counters conventional gender-based terminology. Gerd Brantenberg (and her translator, Louis Mackay) succeed beautifully, using the new words to underline the power of  sex roles in Egalia.  Subtitled "A Satire of the Sexes", there  is throughout the book a streak of caustic  humour as various aspects of the society are  caricatured.  Chest hair on young lordies, for example, is something to be lamented; fortunately, there are hair removers available  and "though they make your skin a bit  sore and tender ...  it's better than going  If someone invited you to an evening of good  plain FUN including •THE LARGEST  FEMINIST smorgasbord west of the Rockies  • DRINKS     • LIVE  ENTERTAINMENT  • CAKE WALKS and they promised you a  • FREE BOOK just for walking in and they  were giving out • DOOR PRIZES including  • BOOKS    • RECORDS    •POSTERS  • FOOD • MASSAGE • THEATRE TICKETS  • CONCERT TICKETS • MAGAZINE  SUBS«ORIGINAL ART «A GAME OF  SQUASH WITH A FEMINIST EDITOR and it  would cost you »$15 or pay-what-you-can  and all the money went to RAGWEED PRESS  (GYNERGY), a Charlottetown feminist press  recovering from a bad fire. ..

WOKLl*  around looking hairy". And the author has  actually come up with a mandatory fashion item approximately analogous to the  brassiere which constrains and embarrasses  the males who wear it. The birth scene in  the Palace of Birth, complete with trumpet fanfare and admiring audience is on its  own a marvelous depiction of institutionalized self-importance.  But mostly Egalia's Daughters is not  funny. Brantenberg carefully constructs a  sexist society with dozens of domestic and  political details that draw us into her char-  powerful statement about oppression based  on gender.  BENEFITS  by Zoe Fairbairns  Virago Press (London), 1979  $9.95, 214 pages  "1984 came and went, but the discussion  continued: had Orwell been right?" Benefits is another of the early SF books written by a feminist to explore the potential of  sexism to create an increasingly nightmarish world. In some general sense (that is,  for most of the men in England), things are  not so bad. But for the women, it is getting  worse and worse.  The primary solution for the financial  woes of the country is the consolidation  of all government benefits (unemployment,  welfare) into a single maternal benefit in order to remove women from the labour force,  increase the birth rate and restore dignity  to the men. What's scary is that the Family  Party, the social/political organization created to gain public acceptance of the new  program sounds a lot like R.E.A.L. Women:  acters' lives. When the heavy scenes come  along — rape, one-sided sexual activity,  family violence—they are all the more disturbing because the feelings they raise are so  painfully familiar against the unusual background.  This is also not a simple role reversal  story. There's an interplay of positive and  negative aspects to each gender. Egalians,  under the wims' domination, respect and revere the Earth, arranging their bio-system  so as to preserve the natural cycles of life.  They are at peace with their neighbours in  recognition of a shared dependence on the  health of the natural world. The wims aren't  "just like men".  Gerd Brantenberg is an active feminist,  and she brings to this book an enormous  number of issues: abortion, contraception,  wages for housework, homosexuality, class,  pay equity, and women's liberation amongst  others. By standing sexism on its head,  Egalia's Daughters becomes an extremely  "Families should be the cement of the nation; women should be the cement of families" .  But the Benefit becomes harder and  harder to obtain: single mothers, wives who  argue with their husbands, women who live  with other women are cut off. And without  the Benefit, women face starvation or rehabilitation:  "The unfit lesbian other who had  gone to the fens for rehabilitation escaped ... She told of a honeycomb of little white cells in the middle of a marsh.  Rehabilitation meant being put into one  of the cells and making it into a home.  You were supposed to paint it and keep  it clean and furnish it tastefully from a  catalogue. When you had done one cell  satisfactorily, they removed one wall  and hooked up a second, and so on until you had made a beautiful home. At  which point the children would be sent  for,  and your husband (or surrogates,  if these were not available).  You would]  then learn to look after them."  Reproductive technology is stepped up  with the goal of selective breeding to ensure  the State will have the appropriate numbers of thinkers, builders, soldiers. None of  the scenarios are too far-fetched to be imagined: the mandatory I.U.D.'s, the permits  for their removal, and, ultimately, the contraceptives in the drinking water.  But vividly depicted throughout the  book, are The Women. Worrying, planning, talking and loving, these are old and  new feminists who have been preparing  for the worst. The Women have built a  movement that is rooted in communities  throughout the nation to support a counterattack. Fairbairns describes the process of  change—in the women and in the women's  movement—as they hang in for the long  haul. Her description is reassuring and instructive.  MOLT BROTHER  by Jacqueline Lichtenberg  Berkley Books (New York), 1982  $2.95, 254 pages  This is the kind of SF that I hate to  describe when my friends ask me what  I'm reading. Jacqueline Lichtenberg unabashedly explores the interaction between  aliens and humans in her books, and this  involves some very strange images. Her favorite approach (she has written numerous  books) is to create an alien whose nature  involves a life-or-death physical dependence  on humans or on another alien race.  In this book, the alien kren are somewhat reptilian: they have finely-scaled skins  that are regularly shed, and their young are  hatched from eggs laid in warm pools of  water. (Are you still with me?) Kren are  highly emotional, secreting venom into a  sac beneath their chins when stimulated by  fear, disgust, surprise or anger. This venom  must then be released with the gentle assistance of a companion (called a bhirhir)  or the kren will attack any nearby human.  The venom phenomenon accounts for the  dependence of the kren and the central importance of the bhirhir relationship in the  book.  Lichtenberg's special skill is her ability to imbue her aliens with familiar human characteristics—speech, clothes, interests. In Molt Brother, the two major characters are Arshel and Dennis, a kren female and a human male. They are bhirhir  which means that Dennis helps Arshel release venom safely. They are also students  who seem to be endlessly writing grant  applications to pursue their archeological  studies. They like going out for dinner; they  have problems communicating with their  parents; they chafe at having to dress up for  meetings with patrons.  There are other bhirhir pairs in the  book, and they also feel more familiar than  alien. The effect is to allow the reader to explore these relationships that are deeply significant, but not based on sexual passion.  Bhirhir make a lifelong commitment to  each other. They are responsible, loving,  playful and indulgent of each other's needs.  Their relationship permits and encourages  sexual interaction with others. Their friendship has an extra dimension since kren survival depends on it. When the bhirhir are  kren and human, the dependencies shift in  interesting ways, even though it appears initially that the kren has less power in the relationship. An interesting book. And I have  to admit that the intricacies of alien nature that Lichtenberg describes in such detail fascinate me.

We are a group  of women who have been meeting regularly  over the past two years to discuss issues of  women's representation in culture. We congratulate the producers of the centerfold for  making available images and text concerned  with lesbian sexual pleasure. We support  the freedom to present sexual experience in  a public medium.  For the following reasons it became apparent to us that among the artist's intentions there is a desire to demystify some aspects of lesbian sex. The content of the centerfold is a series of particular and real images. Due to this particularity the experience represented is markedly different from  the traditions which posit women as corn-  modified sex-objects. The form—16 closely  cropped photographs with accompanying  mise-en-scene text-—creates a confusing intercourse which breaks the voyeuristic habit  of identifying with one central and dominant point of view. The artist's choice of  context for the spread greatly informs the  piece itself: Angles was developed by and  for gays and lesbians to publicly represent  their sexuality.  Given the current climate of "protection"  devised by the British Columbian and Federal governments, as well as a number of private groups speaking under the auspices of  "public morality," the artist must certainly  have realized the confrontational quality of  this work. The protectionist logic of censorship excludes critical thought, and therefore  excludes social change. The work in question confronts this logic (in the form, con  tent and context) and in doing so asks that  we as viewers question our censoring habits.  Any alignment with the prolific conservative reaction to sexuality must be addressed.  The work being discussed here succeeds in  making this address.  The Vultures: S. Lord, S. Leydon, D. Lusk  Trujillo, M. Ross, M. Totino, N. Skogster.  ...and criticism  Kinesis  To all women.  I am writing concerning the centrespread  in Angles, September 1987 which I understand is the official poster for Vancouver International Lesbian Week.  I object to the graphics as pornographic.  I    worked    for    many    years    with  W.A.V.A.W. Vancouver (not the present  organization) and Women In Focus to define, clarify and educate on the issue of violence against women through pornography.  The fragmentation of women and the display of women and their genitalia for the  use of the viewer is pornography.  I do not, as a lesbian, appreciate being  portrayed in this narrow way—'a lesbian is  nothing but a sex object' or 'lesbianism is  nothing but a bedroom issue'.  Lesbianism is a whole, viable and proud  lifestyle including sexuality. I regret that  the organizers of the Lesbian Week negated  this, reinforced negative and misleading attitudes towards lesbianism and, by this, may  have made my life as a non-closeted lesbian  mother less credible.  Susan Moore  A lesbian denied pride in lesbian week  Waxing moon  update  Kinesis  About the waxing moon healing village  Even though things did not turn out at all  the way we had expected, I believe the goddess was watching over us with great care.  One week before signing the deed to buy  the thirty acres in the Malahat district,  Lynne was trying to find the land to take  a look at it. She missed the turn off and got  to talking with some miners down the road.  They told her that they had just recently  bought the underground mining rights to a  big section of land adjacent to "our" property. They believe they have found the new  way of extracting gold from old gold mines,  previously mined one hundred or more years  We didn't want to believe it and spent  all that afternoon on the phone, making  inquiries, just to find out it is true. Also,  the miners have the right to move all their  machines and men through "our" property.  Their mining activity would continue for  miles upstream "our" creek. It was hard and  sad to let that beautiful spot go. Who'd  want to deal with those men and watch  Mother Earth get raped to that extent?  The good that came out of this though,  is that we have found some womyn with a  similar vision. Womyn who feel the purpose  of creating a women's sanctuary with emphasis on harmonious cooperation for self  healing, personal growth, regeneration and  development of skills. We all envision the  possibility of creating an inexpensive Home  Base for independent womyn of all ages,  races, retired or working in a peaceful rural  setting.  We also connected with other womyn  who have been working on creating an independent womyn's community. We decided  to combine our focus and work together.  The other news is—we are legal. Now we  are officially the Waxing Moon Healing Village Society (a non-profit organization). We  have a trust account with CCEC in Vancouver. Brenda Bryan is our treasurer. All  money and correspondence go first through  our treasurer who forwards it on as necessary.  If our concept appeals to you, we encourage you to become members now. This helps  us to pay for mail-outs, advertisements, legal fees (we are now applying for charitable  status so that your donations will be tax deductible) and find suitable land. Membership is $50 to $30 which will entitle you to  a copy of W.M.H.V. Society Act, a vote at  the annual general meeting and you will be  kept updated on our progress and special  meeting notices via the Waxing Moon News.  Plus, you get a reduction on Waxing Moon  Activities.  We are also looking for womyn who would  like to participate as founding land members. Experience in organising, experience  with womyn's groups, business, land development as well as contributing financially  would be an asset.  We're looking for property again. Property which could be economically converted  to meet our special needs—ideally acreage  with access to a lake or river.
