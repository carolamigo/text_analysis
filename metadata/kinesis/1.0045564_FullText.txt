Office  hours are Monday through Wednesday 9 to 5:30, Thursday 9 to 9.  Our new phone number is  873-1427  Three hundred angry demonstrators turned  out at Minister of Human Resources Grace  McCarthy's office on September 14- to protest the recent cutbacks and enforced work  measures under a new Human Resources policy.  The office proved to be closed for  "renovations". Some demonstrators were  heard to mutter "Wonder where the money for  the renovations came from?.." But the unscheduled lockout did not deter the protestors from presenting their case.  The new measures hope to ensure that all  "employable" people will be actively seeking jobs. Standards for judging how employable people are have been determined  by the MHR office.  By the new definition you'd practically  have to be continuously pregnant or permanently disabled to be considered unemployable. Not only will single parent families'  cheques actually be reduced (possibly the  only group in North America whose salary is  going down, instead of up)—but just to  ensure that no one slips through the welfare net and manages to live adequately,  manpower training programs will also be  cut.  These training programs were designed to  help people qualify for employment by  teaching basic skills or by offering pre-  apprenticeship classes.  ■ Some money has been allocated to create new  daycare spaces. However, the 1,000 projected spaces will not adequately fill the needs |  of current waiting lists.  Under the new regulations individuals must  re-apply for welfare every month and single  parents must reapply every four months,  thus creating- a vast amount of paperwork  for social and community workers.  There is no surplus of social work services.  Families in trouble must already wait to  receive counselling or support. Social  workers will now spend' time filling in  forms rather than the work they were  trained for and would probably rather be  doing.  The demonstration was organized by the  Welfare Rights Coalition, a group of people  on welfare and their supporters who have  joined together to fight for a better life  for themselves and their children.  They can also help you appeal you "employable" status if you are presently on welfare or inform you about the Opportunity  Plan approved by MHR.  If you are not on welfare you can still be  a great support to this group. Call or  write your M.L.A., write a letter to the  newspaper or have a group that you are involved with discuss the issue and take  some action.  Confused by our double-double issue?

She  was asked if she had some time to answer  some questions on issues of particular  concern to women:  pornography and  marriage. He stated that he had been  part of a team of researchers whose  survey had been instrumental in getting  rape laws in the U.S. changed. He also  stated that if she wished to receive  compensation for participating in the  survey she could be paid $25 for her  time.  Following a number of innocuous questions, which the woman answered, the  caller asked her comments and opinions  on issues surrounding pornography.  The  questions got more and more personal  (obscene).  The caller hung up.  This may be the same man who last year  called hundreds of women in Toronto  claiming to be a doctor from the provincial health plan who was doing a survey  on medical facility useage. He asked  women about their sex lives. ACROSS CANADA  Incest survivors made video  A feminist video presentation called  "Equal Time in Equal Space" will be shown  in Toronto October 13-17.  The production is not about victims, but  about survivors — women taking power  over their own lives.  "Equal Time Equal Space" was created by  Ariadne and the Los Angeles Women's Video  Centre. Several of the women who produced  the video will be involved in the Toronto  presentation, sponsored by A Space and  the Women's Counselling Referral and  Education Centre.

Formerly, it took office workers 30 months  and six increment steps to reach the full  pay rate for their job classification.  Technical workers, including assayers,  computer operators and draughtsmen, took  10 months to achieve full pay rates in  their classification.  "Now, it's 18 months for everyone," says  Jim Saare, President of Local 9705, representing the office and technical workers  in Trail. "It doesn't feel like we are a  split union any more now that we have a  common increment scale."  The new contract will also bring all office  and technical workers back to the 374-hour  work week. Saare explained that Cominco  had been eroding the long tradition of the  374-hour week, putting some workers on a  -40-hour work week with no extra pay.

Alberta has the  strictest rules of any province regarding  home births. Physicians have been prohibited entirely from attending home births  and since, or course, midwifery is not  licensed, safe birthing alternatives are  drastically reduced.  ASAC has waged an effective letter-writing  campaign, both to the College and the  press. A petition, currently in the process of being collected, already has over  1600 names.  At the end of April ASAC presented a brief  to the College which resulted in a promise  from .the College that they would set up a  task force to study the issue of home  births. However, the -SAC now feels that  tL? College is dragging its feet on this  promise. ASAC's current efforts are aimed  at ensuring that the physicians fulfill  their commitment and that the task force  contain consumer input.

Protest VIA Rail cutbacks  The Vancouver-based Save Our Superconti-  nental (SOS) Committee is publicly calling  for an immediate stop to VIA Rail Passenger  cutbacks.  This response is coupled with that of the  Transport 2000 and Canadian Brotherhood of  Railway Transport and General Workers  (CBRT&GW) groups, organized nationally to  protest the Liberal government's announcement of a 20% reduction in the VIA service.  Bill Hokan, a VIA Rail employee and spokesperson for the SOS Cte. states that "It is  ironic at a time when there is a move toward energy efficient means of transportation, that the Canadian government would  initiate such drastic cuts. It is up to us  to mobilize the public in order to stop  this."  The SOS Cte. is also supporting Vancouver  CBRT&GW locals call for a demonstration of  railworkers and others concerned, to protest the cutbacks on October 14, the  scheduled opening day of Parliament.  Economic public transportation is an issue  that vitally affects the day-to-day life  of women.

This time Falwell has singled out the  Boston Women's Health Book Collective and  their women's health and sex education,  manual, Our Bodies Our Selves.  In a recent newsletter sent to the millions of Americans on Falwell's mailing  list, he charges the book is a "pornographic sex manual". In the mailing,  Falwell urges everyone to examine school  and public libraries for "immoral, anti-  family and anti-American content". If  such materials are found, they should be  reported to the Moral Majority.  "Do you want your child to choose his  values free from your influence and free  from any standard of right or wrong based  on issues like premarital sex, extramarital sex, homosexuality, lesbianism  and bisexuality?" asks Falwell.  Moral Majority officials say they have  had an overwhelming response to the  newsletter and currently a fight is underway in Spencer, Mass. to remove the  book from use in a high-school sex  education course. The Boston Women's  Health Book Collective reports they know  of dozens of new attempts to ban the  manual.  They state that the attack on their book  is symptomatic of what is happening to  women on other social issues.  "We view the attack on Our Bodies Our  Selves as part of the larger attack on  women's rights in general, most notably  in the form of anti-ERA, anti-childcare,  and anti-abortion activity. Though this  activity may represent the viewpoint of  a small minority, it has been well financed, has had an alarming influence on  policy makers, and represents a major  challenge to the women''S movement in this  country."  What specifically do Falwell and his followers find so offensive about the manual?  Their newsletter's envelope carries a  warning: "Sexually explicit materials  enclosed. Do not let this letter fall  into the hands of small children." Under  a heading warning, "Important, Adults  /SS^sr————  "oonhoStiali]  ss^sssr-s  so-ethtnj   °mUg •"• Some of " ^VV"' "*»«  fts peop)ewe J«e an ecomm1c  M'tnoujh this bont < erj,one be able  Only" is a section describing offensive  sections of the book.  For example, "page 26...Photograph of  woman using a mirror to examine self plus  advocating the use of a speculum." Other  "offensive" excerpts were a description  of the joys of masturbation, and a statement that "not until we have an economic-  social system that puts people before  profit will everyone be able to participate. "  The newsletter also carried the following  warning: "Although this book is available  at various places, we object to our tax  dollars being used to provide this explicit, immoral information in our libraries  and our schools. We are still 'one nation  under God'. (Info from Big Mama Rag)  A case of rape in Indonesia  In Indonesia, a young women is to be tried  for killing a man who repeatedly raped her.  The man had been tried for assaulting her  husband - but not for rape.  The woman, Mesu, said that she had determined to kill him because the court had  not punished him, nor even recognized that  she had been wronged.  The man, Salidi, had raped her several  times in her home. Each time he threatened her with a sword. Mesu, a second wife  who lived alone, was afraid to tell anyone  because of his threats. In any case, her  charges would have been difficult to  prove - neighbours later said that she  must be slandering him because he was a  devout Muslim...he always came to rape  her after evening prayer.  Last December, Mesu's husband, Sanan,  caught Salidi in her house. The two men  fought, and her husband was badly wounded.  Salidi was tried for assault - of Sanan.  At that point, Mesu decided to seek justice in her own way.  Even if Salidi had been charged with rape,  it is unlikely that he would have been  punished. In Indonesia, rape is treated  by the courts as a trivial offense; rapists  rarely get more than a year, though the  Criminal Code stipulates a sentence of  twelve years. (Spare Rib)  Working women organize  in India  On May day this year, in the Dhulia Dist-  rice of India, over 2,000 women participated in a working class women's convention organized by the Shramik Stree Mukti  Sanghatana (Toiling Women's Liberation  Group).  The Adivasi tribal people constitute the  majority of the toiling masses in this  district, and the Shramik Stree Mukti  Sanghatana have waged many struggles  around the specific oppression of women  - wife beating, dowry, and rape, as well  as economic exploitation and tribal  oppression.  The convention was a great success. Many  women, mainly agricultural labourers,  came from different villages, some having  walked 12-33 miles in the scorching heat,  walking for two days and, of course,  losing their wages.  The gathering discussed issues such as  the wearing of the Mangalshutra (necklace) and Tika (the dot on the forehead),  both symbols of the Hindu woman's marital  status. There was a strong feeling among  the women present that new forms must be  evolved - secular, non-casteist and non-  sexist - to express joy and fulfillment.  The Adivasi women report that since the  formation of their autonomous women's  organization, wife beating and dowry  have stopped, and men have begun to  share housework. The group has also  campaigned against superstition and  witchcraft, and advocated the use of  medicine.   (Spare Rib) Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis   5  ABORTION  CCCA rallies support for choice  by Julie Wheelwright  In the past week the fight between the pro-  choice forces and the misnamed pro-lifers  intensified in B.C. and women clearly  spoke out for their right to choose last  Saturday.  Under clear blue skies, about 400 protesters  assembled at the Queen Elizabeth plaza carrying placards demanding women have the  right to choose, and a repeal of all anti-  abortion laws.  The Concerned Citizens for Choice on Abortion rally came only two days after the  Victoria General Hospital's board elections  saw three anti-choice candidates win. A  simultaneous rally was held in Victoria to  protest the hospital society's decision.  The Vancouver rally was sponsored by more  than 50 organizations including women from  Terrace, Powell River, Nelson and Nanaimo,  who joined the.march from Georgia to Robson  Square.  The crowd chanted "repeal all anti-abortion  laws, defend a woman's right to choose" and  "not the church, not the state, women must  control their fate", drawing applause and  cheers from bystanders on the streets. One  woman carried a placard which read "I love  children but I demand freedom of choice."  "Women can't contribute fully to society  when we're at the mercy of unplanned pregnancy, " said CCCA spokeswoman Wendy Francis-  Oakley. She quoted Margaret Sanger, who  pioneers contraceptive rights for women at  the turn of the century: "no woman can call  herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a  mother."  "Sixty years later, we're still fighting for  that right," said Francis-Oakley.  "The CCCA goal is the achievement of universal reform: defend a woman's right to choose  and repeal all anti-abortion laws. Our claim  that right to lifers are misnamed is based  on their disrespect for life: women as fully-  developed human beings," she said.  Anti-choice forces currently have control  of the hospital boards in Richmond, Surrey,  and Victoria while pro-choice forces won an  election on the North Shore and Langley's  board will decide on September 16, she  added.  Francis-Oakley accused provincial health  minister Jim Nielsen of "side-stepping the  question" in Surrey. Nielsen appointed a  public administrator to replace the hospital board when the elected anti-abortionists  dissolved the therapeutic abortion committee  and doctors withdrew from all hospital  committees in protest.  "Until the (federal) anti-abortion laws are  repealed the provincial governments can  hide behind them," Francis-Oakley charged.  "It should be our right to decide...we will  only win repeal when we've built a strong  and active movement."  She added various opinion polls taken  throughout Canada and the United States  prove that most North Americans believe in  a woman's right to choose on the issue of  abortion. But she said, "anti-abortionists  have also made inroads...they're waging a  political battle.  "In their vision women will devote their  lives to raising limitless numbers of children. But the allies of the pro-choice movement are varied and growing: we will be  victorious."  Lorna Zabach, a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Women's Health Collective, said their  members daily see the consequences of our  inadequate abortion laws. "Every day in our  work we experience the impact on women of  the diminishing health services for them."  Zabach added women call the collective from  Powell River, Vernon and even Calgary with  worries about getting an abortion in their  own communities. "The women sho call us are  scared. Women are unnecessarily suffering  and the situation is worse."  Because of the current board system, women  wanting an abortion must wait from two weeks  to a month for the board's decision and even  then they must be lucky enough to live in a  community where the abortion committees are  functioning.  "As. economic conditions get worse, there's a  'move to get women out of the workforce. Our  unity can be a powerful weapon in the right  to choose," she said.  Margaret Mitchell, MP (NDP-Vancouver East)  said it is true that the current board  system is not working.  "Women in remote areas have no access to  abortions. Women are being deprived of  their rights: we must work to change our  lives," said Mitchell.  She added women often face community pressure not to chdose an abortion and many  young people are "exploited by pro-life  forces." Young women need to have the right  to an abortion if they need and want it,  she said.  "It is not a question of law or morality.  The right of women to choose is a personal  and medical matter."  Mitchell said the NDP members have been the  only MPs with "the guts" to stand up for  choice in parliament. "I'm quite convinced  that the time is coming when civilized  countries will give women the right to  choose," she said and pointed to Italy's  recent referendum as an example.  Donations gathered at the rally reached  more than $500 at the close.  But problems plagued the rally. The Robson  Square maintenance workers refused to  supply the microphones with power and  Francis-Oakley delivered her speech through  a blowhorn. However the crowd remained  cheerful and when rally organizer Jan  Lancaster announced that the electricity  had been shut off, the crown responded by  chanting, "What do we want? Power! When do  we want it? Now!"  Recent policy from Robson Square manager  Frances Bruce, as indicated in a June 26  letter to the Irish Prisoners of War  Committee, states that "the Media Centre  and People Places, such as the Plaza, must  be totally reserved for non-controversial  uses, specifically, nothing religious or  political."  The letter was written in response to the  committee's request to hold an event  there. Their request was refused.  Bruce also stated: "it is difficult to  differentiate between the many new religious groups and their philosophies, as  well as it is between things that are  political."  Another problem surfaced when members of  one political group began to chant slogans  like "Hail the Red army in Afghanistan"  and to speak on other unrelated issues.  The crowd drowned out their slogans by  shouting "Not the church, not the state,  women must decide their fate." 6    Kinesis    Sept/Oct 81  WOMEN IN PRISON  Behind locked doors: a personal account  by Blu Peppas  My insides feel like exploding, which is  connected with an anger that has been  building up for a long time.  Part of this anger comes from being locked  up in jail. One reason I got there was  that I set out to get caught, so I could  have a secure place to run to. My insecurity was due to supressed emotions that  society pressures you to keep inside.  Of course jail is made to keep wimmin  coming back because the wimmin in there  are a "threat" if left on the loose. They  will fight back, and society is afraid of  that.  No responsibilities to yourself or others  In jail you don't have any responsibilities, to yourself or others. They do  everything for you, which isn't good. They  don't help you inside to be more secure,  they just add to your insecurities. One  of my old patterns was going in and out of  jail, and it was reinforced, in jail and  out. Finally, I realized that this pattern  was destructive to myself and to others.  Most wimmin in jail are charged with heavy  drugs and robbery.  I was charged with  breaking and entering; vandalism, car theft  and driving while drinking.  If you don't  fit in with their charges, you are an outcast, and that alone can cause trouble for  you. And if you're in there for a while  you turn to stone.  You are treated like you're not a human  being, and there is no one to talk to  about problems.  If you have a problem, it  is best to keep it to yourself because  other wimmin have enough problems of their  own and don't want to hear yours.  If you go to a guard to talk, the other  wimmin will think that you are a rat. A  rat is someone who gives information to  the staff about the other wimmin in prison.  These wimmin are very paranoid and they  will literally beat you, or you may die  "accidently on purpose". There is no  support system in there at all. When the  wimmin get filled up with anger, they  fight back, and it ends up in a riot.  There is no privacy, especially from the  vguards, who harass you and intrude on  your space. The male guards are a threat  to the wimmin, who get sexually harassed  most of the time. There have been incidents with female guards as well.  In jail, the walls are grey and negative.  The cells either have two beds or three to  six beds, a toilet and a sink. The day-  room has a couch or two, a table and chairs  that you eat your meals on. Sometimes  there's a T.V., which only has one channel,  or else a run-down record player.  There are bars on the windows and the  doors are thick and cold with one little  peek-hole. Locked doors or bars close off  the dorms from each other. The wimmin  can't socialize all together in there. The  only time you get to see everyone is when  you are let out in the yard or gym. There  is also a big bathroom which has just four  bath tubs, two of which have showers.  It's a negative space to live in  The routine there is always the same. You  get locked up at ten p.m. and let out at  seven or eight a.m. You have breakfast and  then you do work in the dorm. Chores include washing the hallway, the dayroom and  your room and only take one or two hours.  Then you have nothing to do or look forward  to, and the rest of the day is boring.  Once a week you have a contest to see which  group of wimmin has the cleanest dorm.  You get a record or chocolate bar for that.  In the afternoon the guards lock you up for  an hour or more to change shift. The  biggest thing to worry about in jail is  when you are going to wash your hair next.  Wimmin inside fight over nothing, which is  understandable.  It is a very negative  space to live in. You end up very frustrated, lonely and sad. Sometimes you get  to use the gym to play volleyball — if  the guards feel like it. The guards use  their keys as a power tool to open and  close doors on you.  You can't scream in there to release any  anger, or hit a pillow, because there is  the fear of being locked up in "the hole"  if they think you are getting out of hand.  The hole is a small room in the cold basement of the joint. You sleep on a small  mattress on the floor. You have a small  toilet and a bar door so that the guards  can watch you all the time. They use  that hole as a power threat against you.  Sometimes they throw you in there for  simply swearing at them.  I hate prisons and I want to see them destroyed.  They don't prepare you for the  outside world.  They don't give a shit  about you. No wonder the wimmin in there  are hard on themselves and others. The  power is totally taken away from them.  I believe that society creates emotional  problems but can't handle people that have  any.  If we 'step out of line' we are  powerless in the court system and thrown  in jail — especially if we don't have any  money.  Or the government pushes drugs  and alcohol which suppress our emotions to  the point of blowing up, and when we blow  up they throw us in jail.  Political wimmin are also thrown in jail  for standing up for what we believe in.  Let's give support to wimmin inside  . I would like to see us give support to  those wimmin in there now, and those  coming out of there. We have to remember  that they are very angry and mistrustful  of people.  They come out feeling mistrustful because society destroyed the  trust by putting them inside. We need to  find a way to build that trust up. Action  is necessary or we might all end up in  jail, all controlled.  I also want to see us stop picking on one  another. We have to remember who our  enemy is and it is not us. We need more  of a solid base to work from. 0_  We have to remember that they are very angry  and mistrustful of people. Society destroyed  the trust by putting them inside.  Jail is made to keep wimmin coming back because  wimmin in there are a "threat" if left on the loose.  They will fight back and society is afraid of that.  w* Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis   7  INDIAN WOMEN  Native women take action — and the DIA  office  by Heather Conn  It was a political arena alive with pride,  and above all, the dignity of womanhood  prevailed.  There was no self-pity in the voices of  the women who had suffered housing shortages, fiscal mismanagement and poverty-  line living conditions.  There was no passive acceptance of oppression from mothers, grandmothers, and great  grandmothers whose children had gone sick  and hungry due to government neglect.  Instead, Canada's native women verbally  triumphed over decades of hypocrisy and  abuse during their July 20 occupation of  the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA)  regional office. Amidst tears, anger and  contempt of the white man's world, 120  native Indian people emerged with a fierce  demand for recognition of their basic  human rights.  "You should not be treating us like we're  just a piece of paper or a number," Mandy  David of the Carrier nation told listeners  at the occupied offices in Vancouver's  Pacific Centre. "We're people, no matter  how you talk about us. No matter how you  treat us, we are still a strong people.  We always will be.  "Our people will stand up and be recognized, not in your papers, not in your big  parliament buildings, but as people," she  said.  "They (DIA) send us sweet little  letters saying, 'it's so nice to deal with  you'.  It's nice to deal with us alright,  but it's gonna be nicer to deal with  them.  "When we start dealing with them, that's  when we will find out our power."  Power through collecive action  Power through collective action was what  these native women sought. From across  B.C., other provinces and parts of the  U.S. they had launched a women-led sit-in  for survival to bring problems on the  reserve to the public.  They did not depend on men as official  speakers and authorities. As the man who  opened the office door told outsiders:  "The women here give me the direction."  "We are the ones who have to sit back and  watch our people suffer," said Joyce  Willard of Shuswap nation, while sitting  amidst plush office chairs and bright  broadloom.  "We've all come ehre for the  same reason and that's to speak the  truth."  The truth through native women's eyes was  painfully revealed in the signs and placards spread across the office. One read:  "We as mothers oppose the genocide of our  people." Another: "For the last 114 years  the federal and provincial governments  have RAPED our society, our lands and  resources."  Personal testimony of corruption  Fay Wilson of the Homathko nation gave  her own personal testimony of a native  woman's plight: "I myself am an incest  survivor and a child abuse victim.  I've  been raped and beaten since I was five  when my father died, by my own relatives.  And who do you blame for that? All these  years that I've been growing up and  fighting for myself, I was blaming my own  family.  "A lot of scars are left.  But I was  fortunate enough.to come to work with  other Indian people who are concerned for  their rights and I began to realize that  my people didn't get that way on their  Abuse of native women's rights has many  sources, according to the women who spoke,  including grossly imbalanced financial  priorities of the federal government,  callousness and ignorance of DIA employees, and the flagrant irresponsibility of  Fred Walchli, DIA B.C. regional director  general.  For these reasons, the native women have  made concrete demands:  • a full and independent inquiry into the  activities of the DIA in the B.C. region  • a meeting with Indian Affairs minister  John Munro  • the resignation of Fred Walchli, and  • the mischief charges dropped against  the 53 who occupied DIA offices.  So far, their demands have not been met,  but native women continue to confront  their own isolation and alienation. As  Joyce Willard explained on the second day  of the occupation:  "The first time I ever met someone from  DIA, she was supposed to be working for  social development. She sat down and  asked all kinds of questions about what  was happening in the community ... she  tried to act so concerned.  "I couldn't stand it.  I had to get out  of there, because I knew all she was going  to do was pretend to be concerned. She  wasn't going to do anything.  But we're  not going to let them fool us. We're  going to stay and make our stand."  In the words of Gay Williams of the  L'il'wat nation:  "As I see it, DIA is the enemy.  I've  never seen them do anything good for my  band or my people."  Housing rights a priority  Williams said she thinks the federal government's financial priorities are one of  the main factors destroying her people:  "I question, why can they provide money  for welfare and not provide money for us  to build an economic base. ... They talk  about housing. What housing? You can't  even build up an economic base. Everything has to be done through Indian  Affairs. Indian Affairs this, Indian  Affairs that."  Lack of decent housing was a primary  concern expressed. On the Homathko  reserve near Bute Island, a new house has  not been built in more than 12 years.  From the Shuswap nation, a grandmother  said:  "I have a big family and the house we live  in, it's not fit for a big family. We  poke a stick through the wall and it falls  apart. And the DIA calls that your home.  "So I found out how this man Walchli is.  He shouts at you and he wants you to get  scared and run away.  ... That's just how  pushy he is.  "So we told him that this building, this  part here (DIA office) belongs to the  Indians, each and every one of us, no  matter how old, no matter how young. Even  the ones to be born, the ones concerned  about what the DIA is going to do to them  some day."  All the native women at the occupation  had this future goal in common — a better  life for their children.  Thus, they have  refused to silently observe the government's corruption of their chiefs, its  attempts to co-opt tribes with promises  of money, the closure of schools and  practice of injustice in the court system.  "Our parents were used a lot In the past,"  said Gladys Joe of L'il'wat nation.  "But.  our children are going to be stronger.  Our children mean the most to us. We're  going to help them."  And these women have not struggled alone.  They have shared their aims with others,  their brothers. Frank Rivers, of Squamish  nation explained his own commitment to  the women's efforts:  "It's the women that are being strong and  I'm going to stand beside the women here  to the death," he said.  I will stand  beside these women in jail or anything  that's thrown at us.  I will stand with  them because I believe in what they're  doing."  The struggle continues  These women, and the men who support them,  have defiantly rejected the victim status  that society has tried to impose. They  did not heed the court injunction served  by the B.C. Supreme Court to leave the  DIA office. They were dragged from the  occupied office by police and 53 were  arrested and charged with mischief. Their  trial dates have been set individually  from December 18 to the end of March.  But the struggle continues and it will  stay strong. As Mandy David warned,  "They (the government) had better listen  and listen good. Because if our elders  get mad, we can't be responsible.  If our  young grow up angry, we can't be responsible.  "All I can say now is get ready for the  truth, because it's coming out."

We undertook  our series so that all of us could learn  more about the effects of imperialism on  women's lives around the world.  This workshop is a quite different format  than the rest and the content may seem  unconnected with imperalism. What we are  trying to show are the ways we, here in  Canada, are affected by imperialism in our  daily lives and attitudes — and we hope  to stimulate you to use these ideas in  your daily lives and political work.  Throughout the series we've been learning  about the daily survival struggles of third  world people, and particularly of women's  struggles. We've learned of women in Bolivia paid pennies to gather rocks;  women in Africa being sold formula for  their babies for profit with a high death  rate; women in Palestine becoming wage  earners for very low pay in factories  under atrocious conditions.  At the same time as fighting Western imperialism, women in the third world  countries also battle sexism. We've  learned of women fighting against forced  marriages, bride-price and female circumcision. Women in Nicaragua were actively  involved in the war of liberation and are  sharing fully in the reconstruction of  their country. Women in Mozambique and  Guinea-Bissau actively fought to overthrow  foreign domination as well as male domination — what is termed fighting the  "two colonialisms".  Canada, imperialized power  For us here in Canada, the question of  survival is related, but different. Canada  is an imperialist country with a developed  industrial economy. There are those in  Canada whose problems of survival are very  similar to those of third world people,  like native people and immigrants.  However, those of us who have come to this  series are mostly white, mostly women and  mostly feminists. Many of us do not have  working class lives. Immediate questions  of economic survival are not the motivating  force in choosing to attend this series,  or in the political organizing we do.  So our survival questions have been about  defending ourselves as women and our children from being demolished as human beings  by the culture, the media and the people  around us.  As feminists we have done, and continue to  do, important work that analyzes patriarchal systems and values and helps to break  them down. Over the years we've exposed  and battled male violence against women  expressed through pornography, rape,  sexual assault and harassment. We work  for reproductive rights, quality care for  our children, and defend the rights of  lesbians to define their own sexuality. We  are beginning to organize in service and  clerical jobs.  As the transnationals keep moving into  and controlling the third world countries,  "western" values are not far behind. Suddenly women who may have had some status  as providers for their families in non-  capitalist and non-industrialized countries  are becoming service and factory workers  and are feeling the pressure of western  ideas of women as sex objects.  So the work we as feminists are doing here  may be of assistance to women in third  "We hire girls  pnjLtt because they  are easier  :~t to control...9  Over one million S.E Asian j  women now work for U.

Living here in Canada, we're aware of the  U.S. as a major imperialist force.  We  feel the effects of that — our own natural resources are easy prey. Our movies,  T.V., education and books are strongly  American-dominated. However, we can't  overlook the fact that Canada is also an  imperialist and colonizing force, both in  the world and here at home  Canada and Canadian-based corporations  intervene directly and profit from the  exploitation of third world countries.  Canadian investment in the third world is  increasing, while its investment in the  U.S. is declining. Canada has more trading and investment in the Caribbean than  in any other part of the world.  Canadian banks control 60-90$ of the  banking in Commonwealth Caribbean countries. At the end of 1969, direct Canadian investment in South Africa was estimated at $70 million, with Canadian-  based corporations such as Sun-Life,  Massey Ferguson, and Bata being involved.  Black'workers can be employed and paid  below poverty level wa_ges, thereby handsomely increasing profits.  This imperialism also takes the form of  supporting, or at least not condemning,  American intervention in third world ■  countries. Canada may not be the one to  actually "send in the Marines", but would  readily supply goods such as Bata boots to  the military in Vietnam. At present, we  have the situation where the Canadian  government refuses to condemn U.S. military intervention in El Salvador.  And we must not, and cannot, overlook the  fact that the majority white Canadian  population are descendants of colonial  forces that wiped out large numbers of  the indigenous peoples.  White European settlers "discovered"  Canada and used native people's knowledge  and labour". Native people were the guides  for explorers, the healers for the sick,  the teachers of how to cultivate the land  and how to grow food.  In return, the colonialists brought disease and took away  native people's land and rights.  Colonists took away rights,  brought misery  This continues in present time.  There are  land claims all over Canada. Examples as  blatant as Amax wanting to dump 12,000  tons of tailings daily into the water that  is the source of food and livelihood for  the Nisgha peoples are commonplace.  Quebecois people also directly feel the  pinch of -imperialism at home.  In this  supposedly bi-national country, Quebecois  people feel the day-to-day colonial domination of the English in every sphere of  their lives: language, culture and economics. The owners of large corporations  . and natural resources and the management  are still mostly English.  has become one of the management  centres of the world. The growth of  imperialism means more and more work in  finance, banking, advertising and administration for transnationals operating  throughout the world. Correspondingly,  more clerical and service workers are  needed — jobs usually filled by women.  Over the last twenty years the percentage  of women working has grown. Women now  make up almost 50$ of the paid work  force.  Companies also now will hire  women for jobs men used to do because  the jobs require less formal training with  automation and computers, and they can  pay women less money.  At the same time, the ideology is pushed  that women don't really need to work,  are stealing men's jobs and women thus  become the wrong target for anger of the  under and unemployed.  In a similar way, workers in the third  world can be seen incorrectly as the  enemy. Companies in Canada can easily  decide to close plants down and move to a  country with no minimum wage laws, no  unions, large government armies and plenty  of poor people desperately needing the  work.  When the work can't be exported, third  world people are "imported" here. Farmworkers have only recently become organized in B.C. and domestic workers are starting organize in Montreal and Toronto.  Immigrants must also contend with white  Canadians' racism and the frightening rise  in racist attacks.  Since the end of the Vietnam war, more and  more national liberation struggles are  winning and more colonized peoples are  claiming their right to self-determination. As this happens, we in the capitalist centres feel the crunch more.  Our high standard of living is so dependent on the exploitation of the third  world, that when the third world refuses  that exploitation, the developed countries  lose out on cheap natural resources and  cheap labour. Our prices go up, our wages  don't. The media portrays the third world  peoples as communist terrorists.  In these times of economic crisis, many  people's lives are becoming less secure  and they are frightened. So the fear and Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis   9  WOMEN AT WORK  We demand immigration rights for all domestic workers!  by Rachel Epstein  Domestic workers urgently need the support  of the Canadian public in a national campaign to win landed immigrant status for  the thousands of women, mostly from Third  World countries, who are currently brought  to Canada on temporary work permits.  The wages and working conditions in these  jobs are so poor that few Canadians or  landed immigrants will do the work. So  the federal government brings women in  under the temporary work permit system —  a system which ensures that these workers  remain vulnerable, insecure and unable to  demand better conditions. Approximately  10,000 women each year enter Canada on  temporary permits. The majority are from  Jamaica, Trinidad and the Philippines.  As a result of initiatives by domestic  workers and supporting organizations such  as INTERCEDE of Toronto, the Montreal  Household Workers' Association, the Ottawa-  Carleton Immigrant Services Organization,  the International Association of Filipino  Patriots, and the Labour Advocacy and  Research Association of Vancouver, the  Minister of Employment and Immigration,  Lloyd Axworthy, recently admitted that the  temporary work permit system is  unjust  and promised changes that would assist  domestic workers to obtain landed immigrant status. He made these promises in  June when he was confronted by a 30-  member delegation of domestic- workers and  supporting organizations from all across  the country.  However, since June he has issued a policy  which makes things worse  for the majority  of domestic workers.  In order to apply  for landed immigrant status, a woman now  needs a certificate  from a homemakers' or  nannies' school, as well as job experience.  This kind of formal training is not available to West Indian or Filipino women who  normally have years of practical  experience  in all the skills involved in domestic  work. The new policy will mean that a  select group of nannies from Britain and  Northern Europe will get landed status,  while black and Asian women will continue  to be exploited as temporary workers.  Pressure must be applied on Axworthy to  improve immigration rights for all  domestic workers.  In Vancouver, the campaign  is being organized by the Labour Advocacy  and Research Association (LARA), the International Association of Filipino  Patriots (IAFP) and the Committee for the  Advancement of the Rights of Domestic  Workers (CARDW0).  CARDW0 is a recently formed organization  of Filipino domestic workers and their  supporters. Besides pressuring the government for improved immigration rights  they assist individual domestic workers  who are having problems.  The first case they are working on, that  of Roxanne (not her real name), illu  strates the extreme exploitation women are  suffering on temporary work permits and  the necessity of achieving landed immigrant status.  Roxanne came to Canada a year ago to work  as a live-in domestic for a family with  several children. Each month her employer  would make out a cheque for $350 (the  legal minimum wage for a domestic at that  time).  Then she would take Roxanne to the  bank, make her cash it and return $250.  Roxanne was receiving $100 a month in  wages. ,  Imperialism in Canada, continued  anger gets pushed onto women, immigrants,  people of colour, lesbians and gays —  those who are "other" or different or who  want to change the status quo and fight  for their rights.  We are witnessing a highly visible campaign of the new right using racism,  sexism and anti-communism as the focus of  people's anger.  You can bet the ruling  class is helping to finance this campaign.  Sexism, classism and racism are the tools  of imperialism that attempt to keep us  divided and impotent. We want to better  understand the particular character of  She was allowed no friends, no telephone  calls and no contact with the neighbours.  She was totally isolated and always  viewed with suspicion and questioned  about her contact with other people. Several times she was asked to do dressmaking  work for her employer for which she received no extra pay.  She was routinely scolded and yelled at  and twice her employer physically  assaulted her, pinched and scratched her,  pulled her hair, spat in her face and  verbally abused her.  When her employers suspected she wanted to  leave the job, they took cash and personal documents from her room. As well, she  was once told to pack her things because  she was being sent home. Her employer  took her out to the airport, stayed there  for a few hours, then brought her home.  Roxanne did eventually leave her employers  and has laid several charges against them.  Her experience is not atypical, however.  Every day women are suffering the same  sorts of abuses. This is why it is crucial to win the fight for landed immigrant  status so that these women will at least  have the rights and security of other  workers in Canada.  Enclosed in this issue of Kinesis is a  letter to Axworthy demanding improved  immigration rights for all  domestic workers. Please, sign this letter.  It can  be folded in three, taped and mailed  without postage. Also bring up this  issue with organizations you belong to  and get them to write to Axworthy as well.

Hundreds of letters have already gone in,  but we need thousands more to let the  Minister know that Canadian people will  not tolerate racist immigration policies  that undermine the labour rights of Canadian and Third World women..

It's important to understand how these things work  within us as well as structurally.  We are not  each other's enemies and we  need to keep developing a political analysis wereby we can understand the world  and who we're fighting.  But an old lesson  we've learned from the women's movement  is that the personal is political.  All of us have grown up in a world that  encourages us to hate and mistrust each  other so that we become accomplices with  our enemies. We want to examine the  internalized values that we hold, however  subtle, that keep us believing that being  non-white, female, less educated and poor  is also to be not as strong, not as feminist, not as appropriately dressed, not  as popular.  It is impossible to live in this society  and not become poisoned inside, either  literally by alcohol, drugs, pollution,  chemicals in our food, or by values that  make us competitive, jealous, dissatisfied  — you can probably make your own list.  We think the more we root out and protect  ourselves from harmful ideas and behaviour,  the better we can work together to identify  and fight real enemies.

We are only begin-  ning to speak...     ^.^ WQpU Women  The North American women's liberation  movement as we know it today evolved from  a myriad of political forces. It stems  from the women's suffrage movement at the  turn of the century through the sexual  revolution of. the mid-sixties to the  civil rights movement and anti-war protestations toward consciousness-raising  groups of the late sixties and early seventies.  It has been more than ten years since, and  the face of the women's liberation movement has changed profoundly.  We have understood the need to organize  and struggle around such issues as:  * our right to control our own bodies, and  our freedom of choice on abortion  * our right to meet and discuss strategies  as autonomous groups apart from men  * our right to union protection and equal- -•  ity in the workplace  * our right to free community-controlled  childcare facilities  * our right to love whom we choose  Through these political actions we have  debated and continue to debate such topics  as: l) sexual politics; 2) reformist politics vs. revolutionary politics; 3) personal politics and 4) lesbian separatism.  However, we have found that within the last  few years, there has been some political  stagnation in relation to our feminist  analysis. This is exemplified by the way  the women's movement has turned inwards  politically, an experience that every  women's liberation group has had recently  in this country.  The issues I have mentioned have been fundamental to our lives and they still are.  However, we have omitted seemingly broader  issues such as racism and class oppression  because they are not within the experience  of the majority.  We have to begin to recognize the limitations we have set up for. ourselves both in  terms of analysis and in terms of actions.  We have drawn unnecessary distinctions between groups who are organizing around  other issues and the issues themselves. As  a result we are reticent to take up those  issues as our own.  I love sincerity  love sincerity  Racists are most sincere  I hate their sincerity  it is ignorant sincerity  it is selfish sincerity  Racists show their sincerity  in many clear and obvious ways  Make no mistake about this  Cracked up on a  sidelong glance  Riding low, to  escape a high blow  Frenzied heart  Creeping noise  Racists, no integration  a face for each category  they are never sorry  They're riding high today, and  Riding high tomorrow.  by May Luau  Our political action must reflect the "knowledge of our political theory and vice  versa. If we are to take up the issues of  racism and class oppression, we must understand the links between sex, race and class.  We must understand that the oppressor is  the same beast.  It is imperative to recognize the fact that  the women's liberation movement as it  exists today is limited by its white, middle-class perspective.  .My mother and father are Chinese immigrants.  My sister and I spent our childhoods as  daughters of a Chinese laundryman. We were  ashamed of that, we were ashamed of the  colour of our skin, our features, our culture and our parents. We were ashamed of  our lives.  We felt the constant pain of our visibility  Our only chance to survive was by assimilating, to become as white as possible  in-side, in other words, to make ourselves  as invisible as possible. Because I had  this need to be white, my politics were  fragmented. Where did white, feminist politics end and where did the politics developed in isolation begin?  I have finally broken from that total isolation. I have found other angry women who  have felt the pain of their own histories  as non-white women in this society, and  are willing to channel their energy toward  political change.  We understand through women's groups that  minority voice is not necessarily an articulation of personal problems. Similarly  we must understand that non-white feminists, or Third World women, who choose to  struggle in the women's movement are not  to be treated as'tokens on the one hand,  and heard only when addressing the needs  of the "white" majority on the other.  We, who are non-white feminists, have been  unable to put forward a perspective that  speaks from our own experiences because of  our "need" to fit the white stereotypes.  Now is the time for Third World women to  demand recognition for our lives and address the politics.'af the women's movement from our separate Third World consciousnesses.  For just as women came to understand their  personal power and ability to change their  lives through the consciousness-raising  groups of the sixties, we will find similar though enhanced understanding both as  women and as Third World people.  We, non-white feminists, have understood  the lack of privilege in our histories and  in our lives, and we are powerful in our  commitment to overturn the gross imbalance  that exists.  For us as Third World women here, it is  absolutely essential that we address class  as well as race, because most of our predecessors who came to live in developed  countries such as Canada, arrived due to  imperialism.  continued on page 16  The Bridge Poem, by Donna Kate Ruskin  taken from "This Bridge Called My Back"  I've had enough  I'm sick of seeing and touching  Both sides of things  Sick of being the damn bridge for everybody  Nobody  Can take to anybody  Without me  Right?

Here Gayla Reid of Kinesis   speaks with  Sherry Mills, director of Aurora House,the  only all-women addiction treatment centre  in B.C.  Sherry Mills has worked in the alcohol and  drug treatment field for ten years.  KINESIS: What is the diffei  drunk and taking pills and being an alcoholic or an addict?  SHERRY'MILLS:  Certainly everyone who uses  alcohol is not alcoholic, and everyone who  uses medication is not addicted. One generally accepted definition of alcoholism or  addiction is when the chemical use begins  to affect that person in some area of her  life, in work, relaxation, friendships,  political work, family relationships, or  health. This is a tricky situation because most people who are addicted do not  know that the chemical usage is causing  much of their living problems. Actually,  sometimes they perceive the chemicals are  helping them, or, they feel they must  drink or medicate to deal with their problems.  In effect, the problem is exaggerated because of the chemical .abuse.  This is called toxicity.     Toxicity can and  does occur long after the initial affects  of the drug have worn off.  Toxicity is  the long-term affect of the drug on the  physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual  self.  KINESIS: Do you have to drink or take  pills everyday to be addicted or can it be  much less?  SHERRY: Oh yes, it can be much less. There  are so many myths about addiction. A  woman can drink daily, just binge on the  weekends or just drink every few months  and yet be chemically dependent. What  matters most is what happens when we drink  or medicate. Very few alcoholics drink  'daily.  It is much more usual for a woman  to drink 3 or 4 days of the week and take  something for her "nerves" the other days.  What we must look at is what happens to us  when we use our chemical of choice. Can  we control the amount we drink? Can we  control when we drink? Can we control how  we drink? Do we have personality changes,  get into arguments, become hostile, become  submissive, how much do we change?  Some people have what we call blackouts.  A blackout is not the same as passing-out,  you continue to function but have no memory  of that period. Blackouts are a fairly  accepted thing in our society.  I think  this is very sad because blackouts are an  indicator that something is wrong, either  in the amount we are consuming or in the  way our body is dealing with the chemicals.  But we consider it as a normal result of  drinking, when it should be an important  red flag that says, "take note, something  is wrong."  Are there a great range of differences in  how much someone has to take to blackout?  Yes, everyone is different. Not all addicts have blackouts and not everyone who  has had a blackout is an addict. But, if  a person has blackouts regularly, I would  say that person has a serious chemical  dependency.  Often these and other drinking effects -  vomiting, hangovers, the shakes, don't-  cause us trouble because we have organized  our life in such a way that we have sorted  everything out of our life which will  interfere with our drinking.  By the time  we are into an addiction, most of our  friends are using alcohol in much the same  way we are, so that it all looks normal.  Do all women alcoholics do this?  Certainly not all. Many women drink alone,  hide their bottles, and lie about their  alcohol use.  We see the social alcohol scene most clearly with women who drink in bars.  It is a  big problem in the lesbian community because the bar has traditionally been a  place for making social contacts. This is  changing gradually. Many studies say there  is a disproportionate number of alcoholics  among lesbian women.  If this is true, then  maybe this high incidence has to do with  the prevalence of alcohol in a social  scene which tolerates a frequent level of  intoxication. >■ 12    Kinesis    Sept/Oct 8  Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis    13  ALCOHOLISM /ADDICTION  continued from page 11  I also believe alcoholism is a stress-  related disease and dealing with being a ■  lesbian in our society is certainly stress-  provoking .  At times you use the words chemical dependency, then alcoholism, then addiction. Are  they all the same?  In some ways, yes, they are all the same.  Although people come to their addiciton  from different paths, all chemically dependent persons have become physically and  emotionally dependent on their drug of  choice. They experience similar feelings  of depression, anxiety, guilt and self-  hatred, along with the false courage and  euphoria brought on by the drug.  As I mentioned, the paths to the addiction  vary. The woman addicted to minor tranquilizers or pain killers prescribed by  her doctor has different experiences than  the woman who is addicted to alcohol and  who drinks at a women's bar five nights a  week. These women are in turn.very different from the woman needing her daily  heroin fix.  Consequently, the initial treatment for  each of these women will take into account  the type of withdrawal process. Some of  the most difficult withdrawals I have  witnessed have been with women who use  alcohol and legally prescribed drugs together.  The withdrawal from this type of addiction  is a long one. For some it takes up to a  year of extreme emotional highs and lows  to get back to a state of health.  In  contrast, heroin withdrawal, the most sensational for the media, is seldom life-  threatening and the woman is fairly stable  in a matter of days. Alcohol withdrawal  is often life-threatening but a major part  of physical and emotional stability returns  in a matter of a few weeks.  Is there a typical age of an alcoholic or  addicted woman?  There is no typical age.  I have worked  with women who were drinking alcoholically  at eight years old. Some women report pill  addictions starting in early childhood with  traditional medical or psychiatric treatment. We have women who seek treatment in  their 70s, 80s, and 90s. The disease can  begin at any age.  You may have been a social drinker for many  years, or a person who never abused medication in your life, then something will  change and your body's relationship to  chemicals will change. For others, they  were addicted from the very beginning of  alcohol or drug use.  So there is no pattern,  age doesn't matter?  No. We see more young alcoholic and pill-  addicted women in recent years because  more young people are using these drugs.  It is important to remember that alcohol  and drugs have addictive properties that  have nothing at all to do with the emotional stability of the person using them.  No matter how many or how few problems a  woman has, she will not become an addict  without ingesting an addictive substance.  i any addiction prone  Do you think there  <  occupations?  No.  I think we are beginning to look at  the professional community and the chemical abuse in their lives. These people  have a degree of privacy and autonomy in  their work. They can hide their addiction  much longer than the secretaries, factory  workers, and other employees who are closely  supervised. We see this disease equally  in every occupation as far as I can tell.  It has no class or occupational boundaries.  Is it a matter of will?    Why is it so  difficult to quit?  I think one major reason is that the alcoholics or addicts often do not realize  that the chemical is causing their problems.  They may think it has some influence and  should cut down, but they just cannot see  clearly what is happening to their lives.  The reason they can't see clearly is  toxicity.  Toxicity  is the state of being drug-affected,  even when they-are not drinking or medicating at that moment. They think that  because they didn't use their chemical that  day, they are sober and thinking clearly.  But they are not.  Their reasoning powers are affected, their  impressions of the world and how they relate to it is skewed. That is the problem.  If people could be rational in the middle  of a chemical dependency, then they would  have a better chance of stopping.  other people who have been chemically  dependent and who understand what was and  is happening in her life. That is why  self-help organizations like Alcoholics  Anonymous and Women for Sobriety are so  important in the addict's recovery.  A woman may need residential treatment to  have enough time to get her body built  up, her brain clear, and the central  nervous system calmed down enough so that  she can begin to look rationally at her  own life.  It is very important for her to  have time, health and space to separate  the real person she is from the crazy,  toxic person she has been.  Are there different approaches to treating  addictions?  Yes, there certainly are. This is a difficult question to answer briefly. There  are so many approaches to this problem.  Each and every one has probably helped  some people but I believe the more holistic  the actively-addicted person.  Psychotherapy on the active addict is  virtually useless. This is because the  addict can display many types of readily  diagnosable behaviour that just fall away  as she sobers up or withdraws from drugs. ■  Most of us who work under the disease model  believe that the toxic reaction will cause  personality changes.  We do not know and  we cannot treat,   the real personality until  she is chemically free.  Another significant difference in treatment is recognizing the importance of  nutrition. At Aurora, we see it as an  important part of recovery and long-term  maintenance of the disease. Much of what  is called weak-willed or addictive personality traits come from physical imbalances,  such as low blood sugar.  These can be brought on by physical reactions to stress, sugar, caffeine, nicotine,  and processed carbohydrates, all combined  COMMENTS OF RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC WOMEN:  "By the time I got to A.A., I'd tried  every denial there was.  I even acknowledged that I had a "drinking problem"  but denied that I was an alcoholic.  I'd  tried switching from hard to soft stuff,  limiting my drinks, changing times or days  I allowed myself to drink, etc.  But my  drinking never changed.  By the end of it, although I was still  functioning, I couldn't tell the difference between reality and the distortions  of my own brain. The most frightening  part was that I let myself get sicker and  sicker because all the time I thought it  was just me, that I was crazy.  I didn't  know alcohol could do that to you so, in  my mind, it wasn't the booze, it was me  that was the problem. Residential treatment was necessary to get myself together  again. Now I know I'm not the person I  thought I was. A.A. helps to remind me of  where I've been and where I'm going. When  I wake up in the morning, I know that I  have friends doing just like me, making it  through life without a drink, one day at  a time."  "Women in Sobriety (lesbian A.A. meeting)  is for me a home.  It is a place of hope  to a new way of life, a place where I can  relate to the women in my sufferings and  my joys, and share with them the gift they  freely give with no obligations, the gift  of love and support in my fight with alcohol. For, before I came to A.A., I was  lost in a cruel world of self-hatred and  self-remorse and alocohol was my GOD. Now  I have self-love and self-respect - more  than I can ever have wished for - a chance  to be reborn."  "I was introduced to A.A. by being in  prison.  I was at Twin Maples farm. The  court system made me go.  I finally ended  up rebelling against it.  In due time I •  did go on my own. Especially when I ended  up in hospital for bleeding ulcers.  This  program has helped me to be more honest  with myself.  It takes time but it is  worth it.  Just walking into a supportive  situation is healthy and positive for you."  "I walked into the doors of Alcoholics  Anonymous approximately 10 months ago.  Since I have been in this program I have  found a new freedom. I am no longer bound  by the obsession to drink.  It is hard for  me to explain the feeling of being free of  something that seemed to be such a big part  of my life.  I used to drink approximately  every two days.  I would go to work and all  I would think about was where I was going  to go drinking afterwards. My friends at  that time were also drinkers so finding  people to drink with was never a problem.  We always got together and when we did it  was usually a big drunk.  In my own eyes at  the time this was normal thinking."  "Women in Sobriety (the lesbian A.A. meeting) is a place of belonging for me.  There's no other place on a Sunday evening  I'd rather be. Beats the hell out of the  "Hut" (a bar in Bellingham open Sunday  nights.)  For most people the decision to stop usually occurs when the negative effects have  begun to outweigh the positive.  It's no  longer fun or numbing out the problems of  the world; the chemical dependency has become a nightmare. Depression, paranoia,  anger, and self-loathing are dominant  feelings. It is physically killing them,  they feel crazy, or they are hurting people,  in their lives.  For whatever reasons they do decide to  stop, usually chemically dependent people  can not do it by themselves.  The majority  of people really need strong support systems to relearn how to deal with their  lives free of chemicals.  Addiction just doesn't come on in a day.  It's not that one day a woman is sober,  sane and clear, and the next day she is  drunk, crazy, stoned, toxic, confused.  The disease is a gradual, insidious one  for most people.  If people did go rapidly  from good health to ill health and irrational behaviour, they would probably take  control more quickly.  But the disease is so slow, the addicts  don't see it as an outside influence affecting their behaviour. They see it as  themselves, going crazy, becoming a bad  person, being weak, having no will-power.  When a woman starts to put her life together, to deal with life without chemicals  it is very hard to do without talking to  our approach the better the chance for  recovery. Many recovering alcoholics,  addicts, and effective professionals in the  field, believe an addict needs abstinence,  good diet, a strong support network, and  some framework for personal growth.  Within the traditional medical and psychiatric professions, a woman's addiction is  rarely detected. A woman is often medicated for what are actually side-effects of  alcoholism or side-effects of another  medication.  Even when an addiction is detected, it is  rarely dealt with in a way that will  assist her. A cross-addiction may be  started by prescribing drugs in place of  alcohol. Or, all prescriptions may be  suddenly stopped, causing an unnecessarily  severe withdrawal.  In these cases, a recovery program has not been started.  The medical and psychiatric professions  seldom use a holistic approach to addiction, do not necessarily demand abstinence  from the addictive substances, and seldom  refer the addict to a support network or  specialized addiction counselling.  These professions often begin working on  the person, as if a personality problem is  primary rather than the addiction problem.  They do not approach chemical dependency  from a disease model, based in the belief  that the toxic reaction to the drug causes  much of the personality that is seen in  with the toxic affects of the drug of your  choice. An analogy can be made to the  disease of diabetes. The diabetic is responsible for the day to day nutritional  management of her disease. The addicted  person is the same.  The important thing is for women to get  help that specifically addresses the  addiction. Although recovery programs may  vary, our knowledge of addiction is still  in its infancy, and many services do not  have adequate consciousness about women's  special needs, women can not afford to  wait.  What are the things  What about friends?  they need to know?  Firstly, we have to learn to call chemically affected people on their behaviour.  It is hard to do this because we are so  indoctrinated that drinking is always okay.  Friends feel guilty, they feel they don't  have a right. Most people feel they are  making a moral judgement.  But we must point out and link the disturbing behaviours to the chemical dependence,  if we are going to help the person or save  the relationship.  Examples would be, "I feel bored being with  you when you are affected by the medication  you are taking." Or, "the last three times  we have been together we've had violent  arguments after you started drinking.  Therefore, I will only see you when you  are not using alcohol."  There is no guarantee these steps will  work, but they may help.  It.is important  to speak honestly to the chemically-  dependent person, rather than to lie about  their behaviour not bothering us, or, just  to fade out of their lives.  Secondly, offer help. A list of resources  is provided in this feature; keep them on  hand, don't try to do it alone. There are  several sources of support in your community. If you found out your friend had any  other serious disease, you would seek out  quality care and support, not try to deal  with it alone.  Thirdly, learn about chemical dependency.  Many people just want their friends to  control their chemical abuse and to behave  themselves when they are with them. That  is like asking a person with hay fever to  only sneeze when they are alone. As long  as her disease is active, that is—the  person is using chemicals, she does not  have effective or consistent control over  how, when, or why, she behaves as she does.  Abstinence in most every case is the ultimate answer.  Be supportive of her need  and desire to lead a chemical-free life.  Fourth, and the hardest advice. You may  have to let that person go from your life.  Friends and family are often driven to  serious emotional and physical collapse  after trying to help the chemically dependent person over a, period of time. The  dependent person has to feel the consequ- -  ences of her chemical abuse.  If we cushion  this in any way, we are prolonging her  realization of how sick and out of control  she is.  Is it common to follow a pattern of stopping and starting,  over and over?  Yeah, that's fairly common for alcoholics  to stop for a little while. Friends might  think that if the person can stop for  awhile, maybe they just don't have a drinking problem, maybe that's just the way they  are.  But the alcoholic can be very cunning. They  say, "See, I'll stop Drinking for two weeks  or a month, no problem" and they do it;  sometimes they are able to stop. Then  they just say "get off my back" and go  back to drinking the way they did before.  But when they start drinking again, the  point is they get into trouble with it  again.  What about the propaganda that surrounds  drinking and taking pills?    I'm thinking  about beer ads on TV,  ads for liquor in  glossy magazines.    Row important are these  images as creators of the problem?  I think they are really important - most  of us realize the power of advertising in  our lives and how subtle that is.  In  advertising we get all kinds of messages  about how to be a woman and we have to  fight those messages in all areas of our  lives.  It's my experience that people drink because they want to feel normal, whatever  that is. As we all know, the way advertisements portray normal  may be a really  unhealthy state for women to try to  achieve.  It may not be what we are.  So I think we have to fight those advertisements. Most of us are aware of the  drug companies and the problems with unsafe drugs on the markets.  We know  doctors prescribe far more drugs for women  than for men. Some of this is due to  their personal sexism and some due to  pharmaceutical company advertising. This  really shows up in the numbers of women  addicted to prescription drugs.  Almost every woman that I've ever treated  has a psychiatric diagnosis other than  addiction or alcoholism.  I don't think,  out of the several hundred women I've  worked with, that I would label more than  ten or twelve women as having psychiatric  problems. Our doctors label us; they give  us drugs; we become addicted, and the  circle widens.  The Women's Health Collective has a lot of  information about drug advertising and the  effect it has on women.  It's well worth  the time for any organization that works  with women to be informed about this.  What would you like to see done yourself  about attitudes in the community?    How do  you feel about benefits,  for example,   the  fund-raising benefits are usually a drinking scene.     Do you feel they should be  stopped?  Well, I don't think we should stop the  drinking, but I have difficulty with the  benefits where you have to crawl over  three tables and get to the back corner to  get to the non-alcoholic beverages.  I feel like there is a large and growing  segment of the community that does not  drink alcoholic beverages.  I would like  to see that be more validated.  I'd like to see more public information  about addictions.  I'd like to see women's  organizations, around town getting access  to specialized Information about addiction,  so they can deal with people who have  addictions in the most helpful manner.  It's not a simple problem. Alcoholism or  pill addiction won't necessarily go away  when a woman's consciousness is raised and  she becomes a feminist; it won't necessarily go away when she discovers, as a  battered wife, that she didn't deserve the  batterings.  A woman will not be able to take her power  as a woman without getting control of her  addiction.  Do we have enough resources for women in  B.C.?  No. With an estimated 40,000 to 50,000  women alcoholics and uncounted numbers of  women addicted to other drugs, we are  severely lacking in services. Within the  services we do have, some are aware of  women's special needs.

This section was taken from LESBIAN HEALTH  MATTERS! BUT it applies to all alcoholics every  where regardless of sexual preference.  As an alcholic gets further down the road, she can less  and less take care of herself. People around her who  care about her start picking up the pieces of her life that  she is no longer able to handle. The co-alcoholic is  usually the alcoholic's lover, but also can be a friend, a  drinking buddy, a relative, or a co-worker. A co-  alcoholic comes to depend on being needed by the  alcoholic and is eventually addicted to the alcoholic just  as the alcoholic is addicted to the bottle.  Co-alcoholism is a specific form of the general relationship pattern where one person is the "victim" and  the other is the "rescuer." The co-alcoholic/rescuer  needs the alcoholic/victim to be dependent on her to  guarantee her own self-worth. Women in our society are  encouraged to be nurturing-the line between this nur-  turance and co-alcoholism is often very fuzzy.  The following are signs of co-alcoholism:  • Making excuses for what the drinker says or doesn't  say; making excuses for what the drinker does or  doesn't do  • Worrying about partner's drinking and neglecting  care for yourself  • Tolerating partner's drinking and behavior and taking  care of her  • Feeling that somehow you can save the drinker with  your love, despite her repeated failures to control the  drinking  • Feeling you may be the cause of the drinking or have  to be responsible for its consequence and/or costs.  • Threatening to leave but not carrying it out  • Cutting out activities for fear that people may find  out "how things really are"  • Being embarassed by partner's drinking  • Being worried or afraid of drinker  • Calling work to give an excuse for someone who can  not go to work because of a hangover  • Feeling angry that your relationship is in jeopardy because so much money is being spent on alcohol  • Calling bars, neighbours, friends looking for whom  you believe is out drinking  The relationship between an alcoholic and a co-  alcoholic is dangerous and destructive to both. An  alcoholic will seek treatment or help to stop drinking  out of her own pain. By "taking care" of an alcoholic,  the co-alcoholic is protecting the alcoholic's life, which  prevents the alcoholic from feeling the sharp knocks of  alcoholism which would make her realize she needs  help.

Aurora is the only all womens'  residential treatment program and we have  13 beds. There are no detoxifying or  residential treatment programs which accomodate women with children.  A day treatment program is being proposed  which I hope will have special women's  groups. Our treatment system is just now  at the stage of recognizing that women do  have special needs, both in residential  and in out-patient treatment.  The problem of chemical dependency is  really complicated in some ways, yet, in  others it is manageable. Not easy  but  manageable.     I haven't discussed the  specifics of prescription medications as  much as I would have liked, street drugs,  co-alcoholism, or hypoglycemia and nutritional imbalances. The problem of chemical dependency touches all our lives,  personally and politically.  I hope this  discussion will be helpful in encouraging  increased awareness around this issue.  The danger for the co-alcoholic is that she feels more  and more like a failure. She gives tons of energy and  caring and still her friend/lover is getting worse as the  alcoholism progresses. The co-alcoholic is so busy taking care of the alcoholic she doesn;t take care of herself.  She doesn't take care of herself. She doesn't have any  fun in life. And if her relationship with one alcoholic  should end, she will usually find another to take care of.  Recovering lesbian alcoholics have said that the lesbian  community is full of co-alcoholics. The threat, "So-and-  so will take care of me if you don't" was used by an  alcoholic to keep her co-alcoholic partner "in line."  Co-aleoholism is more elusive and may be more difficult to cure than alcoholism. The co-alcoholic has got  to face whatever it is inside herself that says she is not a  complete person without someone being dependent on  her. She has got to start taking care of herself instead of  taking care of her partner. BOTH THE ALCOHOLIC  AND THE CO-ALCOHOLIC HAVE GOT TO  REALIZE THAT NO ONE CAN EVER CAUSE  ANOTHER PERSON TO DRINK, AND NO ONE  CAN CAUSE ANOTHER PERSON TO STOP  DRINKING.  The victim/rescuer relationship is a hard one to  break. Each person is threatened, even unconsciously,  by the other's possibility of becoming a whole person on  her own.  When I stopped being a co, I realized that the  whole world didn't run on my being perfect...  and I started to be able to relax and enjoy life."  (Anon.)

Many Alcoholics Are Hypoglycemic  Many alcoholics have alcohol-induced hypoglycemia  which is chronic low blood sugar. The symtoms are wide  ranging and include: exhaustion, depression, insomnia,  anxiety, irratibility, headaches, sweating, chronic indigestion, muscle pain, dizziness, etc., etc. Alcohol  reduces the output of glucose (sugar) by the liver, which  may exaggerate low blood sugar. Alcohol can produce  the same effect as sugar.. .so chronic drinking, just like  excessive sugar in the diet, contributes to the development of hypoglycemia. Also, someone with hypoglycemia is a potential candidate for alcoholism.  If you think you might by hypoglycemic, get a fasting  blood sugar test for the proper diagnosis. Many times  just the acknowledgement of hypoglycemia and the  necessary changes in diet will alleviate the symptoms.  -taken from LESBIAN HEALTH MATTERS!

CO-OPERATIVES  Co-ops: Tool for Social Change?  by Jan de Grass  In Yugoslavia there is a woodworking co-op  that has been in existence for 75 years.  It has operated as a co-op through two  world wars, a monarchy, fascist invasion  and a brief period under Soviet wing. Today it still operates and thrives in Yugoslavia's worker self-managing system.  The longevity of this co-op and of the coop movement is assured because co-ops  appear to have few enemies. Though they  are truly an international movement their  economic profile is lower than that of  corporate business and their public image  reveals an apparent political neutrality.  This has gained them supporters from groups  as diverse as Ananda Marga Yoga right  through to the New Democratic Party.  Why support co-ops?  What percentage is there, then, in supporting a movement that resists capitalism  with all the fortitude of a marshmallow?  There are some good reasons. Their  strength is in their survival, in what  they can teach us, and in their ability to  grow. Their wave has still to crest.  Involvement in a co-op can mean more than  your four hours a month work shift in your  local food co-op. Co-ops can touch lives  in many more ways.  Probably the only way some of us can afford housing in Vancouver today is to pool  our capital into a housing co-op. We can  insure the building through the Co-operators Insurance Company. We can buy the  majority of our groceries at a food co-op.  Every so often though we might want to  sample some of the different fresh fruits  and vegetables at the market. Often these  are grown and sold through farmer's marketing co-ops such as the blueberry growers ' co-op in Richmond.  At home we can turn on Co-op Radio while  drinking a cold glass of Dairyland milk  (dairy producers co-op) from the fridge.  And if milk is boring and you'd rather be  drinking that sparkling white wine from  grapes grown on a co-operative in Spain,  then check the balance in your savings  account which you keep in a credit union  (a close relative of co-ops).  Can't afford it? Call your friend instead. She  works in a worker-owned graphic arts co-op  but can't go for a bottle of wine tonight  because she has to get the kids ready for  co-op daycare in the morning.  You get the idea.  In reality, very few  people, even dedicated co-operators, go  through life unsullied by the average com- .  mercial transaction. Most goods are still  bought and sold in the capitalist marketplace. But a surprising percentage are  not.  There are three major categories of co-ops  in Canada:  Producer Co-ops:  In which members produce  goods or services independently and use  their co-op to purchase supplies, pool  their sales and market their product. Examples of these are the larger agricultural  co-ops, like United Grain Growers or dairy  farmer's co-ops.  Artwork or crafts are often marketed this  way, too, - for example, Circle Crafts Coop.  Consumer Co-ops: In which users (consumers )  pool their resources: money, labour, etc.to  enhance their buying power or provide themselves with a service. This is probably the  most well-known type of co-op to most city-  dwellers as it encompasses food, housing  and daycare co-ops such as the East End '  Storefront Co-op in Vancouver or the Grand-  view Housing Co-op. r  Workers' Co-ops:  In which workers own  shares in their workplace which provides  them with employment. The owner/workers  generally make decisions about managing  their own capital, distributing their surplus and determining their working conditions.  An example of this in Vancouver would be  CRS Workers' Co-op which operates a food  wholesaler and a bakery.  One food distribution warehouse in Vancouver known as Fed-Up has a membership composed not of individuals but of thirty  other smaller food co-ops in B.C. In the  early years of Fed-Up ideals ran high. The  warehouse was staffed by a women's collective of varying political persuasions.  On one occasion Bun and Bradstreet (the  corporate credit directory) phoned to make  discreet enquiries as to Fed-Up's financial  health. After collecting the usual data:  accountant's name, sales figures, type of  business, etc., the interviewer hastened to  ask question number 8C-Purpose of Business.  After thinking for a moment the Fed-Up  staffer confidently replied "to overthrow  capitalism"I  But it's not too often co-ops throw their  hat in the ring and make such a public  political statement. Usually the co-op circus practises a different balancing act.  The acrobatics consist of keeping one foot  firmly rooted in traditional commerce and  one eye on a more humane vision. As if  this were not difficult, some co-ops also  attempt a simultaneous juggling act.  Conflicting issues are tossed back and  forth like flaming brands. Shoud we carry  Granny Smith apples at a competitive price  even if they are grown in Chile? Or should  we carry expensive Granny Smiths grown in  New Zealand?  Can co-ops afford to have a social conscience? Quite often they are in a familiar  predicament.  Just like the woman who must  work twice as hard to be thought of as half  as good, co-ops must work with all the  flair and dynamism of a corporate concern  to stimulate sales and retain their piece  of the market. Yet they must prove twice  as effective and more responsible to their  membership, something Nestles or Exxon  rarely have to consider.  Two of the six principles that govern coops best epitomize the differences between  co-operatives and private businesses:  1. Participation in co-ops is by members  only and membership is open to all.  Members contribute their share capital and  own a piece of their co-op, but their commitment does not end there. This contribution of share capital is a financial investment but it is not an investment designed to make any individual wealthy.  If the co-op turns a profit (usually called a surplus) then every member is guaranteed a say in how that surplus is distributed. It could be funneled back into  the co-op for next year. Or it could be  rebated to the members should they so  decide.  Often the co-op member invests her time or  labour into the co-op as well. Her return  on investment is a stake in the co-op's  community.  Women have never been noted for their high  profile on the stock exchange. Money is  usually required to generate more money and  women have traditionally owned only one/  fifth of the world's wealth.  For many women owning a share in a co-op  is the closest they will come to owning a  share in any business. And whether it's  your home, your food supply or your employment, ownership is very powerful.  2. Decision-making is democratic.  One member has one vote, regardless of  size of share, involvement or position.  How to arrive at that democratic decision  is a subject of prolonged debate and many  systems have been tried. But whether a  board, a committee or a hired manager makes  a decision, it must be ratified in some  way by the whole membership, either through  a majority vote, consensus or delegate representation. How the system is set up is  for the co-op to decide.  The feminist connection  Feminist businesses are often attracted to  the co-op model of management, as it can  be contained in a non hierarchical framework. Democratic decision-making allows  and actively encourages a say in how the  workplace is managed.  Traditionally, hierarchical management  structures havn't given women a very high  priority. Men are too often the bosses.  When women have been passed over for.promotion or benefits in a traditional business it's easy to see why the co-op model  is very attractive.  Even before we become conscious of their  benefit we often support co-ops so as not  to contribute to the "other" system.  A purchase of goods or services at a co-op  keeps the money in that community. Some  co-ops can bring new money into that same  community. Funds and ownership of the  co-op are controlled by those who shop,  live, or work at them.  But co-ops have their limitations. Although  you are definitely supporting an anti-  capitalist system, you're still not supporting a new economic order. Co-ops are  an island of economic equality in a sea of  capitalist wealth. As a tool they're very  effective; as a solution they're not.  The left has often criticized the co-op  movement for these same insular tendencies 16   Kinesis Sept/Oct  WOMEN'S CULTURE  Connie Kaldor: "One of These Days" ...  by Roseann Moran  There was a sense of urgency and movement  about Connie Kaldor when I talked to her  in July. Movement because Connie was one  of the "stars" of this year's folk festival  and she literally had crowds following her  — to congratulate, to compliment, or  simply just to get an autograph. Urgency  because Connie was booked solid and barely  had time to sit and talk for half an hour.  I caught her in between a duet with Rick  Scott of Pied Pear and the Hopeless Romantics workshop where she was joined by  other romantics such as Meg Christian and  David Sereda ... the combination was deadly  even for the less romantic people in the  audience.  Connie's music is warm, strong and  straight from the heart — with some interesting twists. She has been a musician  "forever" and began writing songs when she  first got a guitar, way back in the days  of her Saskatchewan youth.  Born and  raised there, Connie moved out to Edmonton  to study theatre, where she received her  vocal training as well as her infectious  stage presence.  Having performed as a musician off and on  since high school, she' decided to try it  full time three years ago. At that time,  her goal was to get into the big festivals  and to cut an album, a goal which she  realized by accepting any and all invitations to play.  She mentions gigs like Medicine Hat, YWCA  banquets, and town halls, — "it's all  good experience". She worked in a country  music band at one point, but has done most  of her work solo.  Connie's musical style is eclectic and so  is her audience. Perhaps part of the  reason she is able to attract a wide variety of people is because she is funny.  Her philosophy is that people have to  laugh, that humour is more powerful than  anger.  For example, in her song JERKS, Connie  ridicules all the guys who hang out in  little packs and make life uncomfortable  for women.  It offers an hilarious, biting  criticism of something that often makes  women very angry.  Her songs also have a ring of independence  and growth.  Her latest song, "Bird on a  Wing", tells the story of a waitress who  is waiting, in a town where nothing is  happening, for someone or something to  make her life worthwhile.  In the end,  she realizes that she has to be her own  "bird on a wing".  Although she doesn't sit down specifically  to write non-stereotypical songs and  doesn't bill herself as a "feminist" musician, there are a lot of links between what  Connie Kaldor is doing and saying, and what  is happening as a result of the women's  movement.  She doesn't call herself a feminist, because she isn't actively working for  political change, but she supports the  "cause" and does benefits for women's  functions.  Connie sees herself as having  Co-ops: Tool for Social Change, cont'd, from p. 15  and while some criticism is valid, the  left often fails to see the many organizing tools available in this fertile training ground.  Co-ops teach us how to co-operate with  others. They teach us how to share an  equality based on our labour, not on wealth.  Co-ops develop models for democratically-  controlled decision making that can change  the way we work with others. The co-op  struggle has often included the struggle  against sexism, individualism and hierarchical relations.  And co-ops have always worked to regenerate  the idea of a co-operating community - a  necessary step for social change.  As this decade begins there are some signs  that co-ops will not muffle their collective voice any longer. In his younger  years, Alex Laidlaw, co-op philosopher and  theoretician, advocated political neutrality for co-ops. But two years ago in an  article entitled simply "I've Changed My  Mind", he sounded a new note:  "I am convinced strict neutrality is a  luxury which co-operative leaders can no  longer afford in these dangerous times. We  cannot go on tending our gardens while the  world is falling apart all around us."  Clearly it's time for Co-i  Right!    0.  : Against the  received strong support from the feminist  movement and realizes that she would not  be where she is without that help.  Connie finds life on the road now a vast  improvement over the way it was even a  few years ago when she was sometimes the  only woman at a festival.  This improvement is due partly to the fact  that she is running into a lot more women  on the road. As well, she thinks both  audiences and people in the music business  are beginning to take.women who are professional musicians a little more seriously.  Would she go out of her way to have an  all-woman production musician team on a-  record? Connie points out the problems  both in terms of expense and the availability of women musicians, especially in  Canada.  She basically feels that "a good record is  a good record".  Thus, while she understands and sympathizes with the concept of  all-women productions, her commitment  appears to be to music first, and the  politics behind the music second.  What does the future hold for Connie  Kaldor? She want to tour next year — to  Europe and Japan.  She is also thinking  about the possibility of T.V. and film,  and wants to do more voice work and song-  writing.  Connie also wants to make a "shitload"  financially. There are inevitable difficulties in attempting to combine personal  integrity with that kind of a goal, but  she believes the challenge lies in doing  both ...  In the meantime, if you haven't heard her,  Connie's new album, "One of These Days"  is great.  It captures much of the feeling  and vivacity that she puts across in live  performance. She is also playing at the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre on Sept.  20 and 21.  Q  Politics of Visibility, cont'd, from p. 10  Our families left their indigenous countries to suit the demands of colonial  capital. They left their own countries  because of poverty and famine, in order  to survive.  Not only is it important for non-white  feminists to begin to understand their  double oppression and define their politic in light of their own history, it is  in the interests of white feminists to  confront their own racism. The racism  that continues to be embodied in the  structure, attitudes and politics of the  women's movement as a whole.  White women must learn to listen to the  concerns of Third World women, be aware  of their own attitudes against Third  World people, pursue the knowledge of  Third World cultures and histories in  order to expand their own knowledge. White  people too often have the psyche of the  imperializer, unable to give recognition  to differences that are valid and equal.  White privilege affects the whole fabric  of this society, and this includes the  women's movement.  We are.at a turning point in the herstory  of the women's liberation movement. We must  move forward and not be afraid to dialogue  as equals. If we can do this, we will most  certainly move toward a women's liberation  movement that is truly representative of  all oppressed women. VISUAL ART  Ovular III: feminist photographers unite  by Michele Wollstonecroft  Shushana and I were at the stream,  bathing. 'ñ† I was splashing my thighs with  a yogurt container refilled with stream  water; Shushana was lying in a pool  letting her breasts float on the surface  of the water and watching the water  spiders go running over them "...Look,  there's a feminist photographer." We  looked up to see another woman clad only  in a 35mm camera happily documenting our  ablutions.  That was typical of the mood- of Ovular  III, a six day feminist photography  slides this double exposure created the  reverse image, that the window and space  within that window were solid images and  the forest was the phantom moving into the  space.  During a showing of our slides, Pat project-  black-and-white negatives of a ritual  seminar held at Rootworks, Sunny Valley,  Oregon, in July. During Ovular III (the  seminar is in its third year) I had the  opportunity to experience breathing,  eating, sleeping, dreaming, shitting,  talking, living feminist photography.  Ovular III happened at a good time for  me. Recently my awareness of myself as  a woman photographer has undergone some  changes.  I'm trying to disregard my  art school ideas and scholarly background and assert a sense of my expression as a woman photographer. Traditionally woman's art has been demeaned to  "crafts" status beside "fine art" and is  only now finding recognition again. As  a result I suspect that those moments  when I am truly in touch with my  "woman images" are quickly repressed  for slicker, more readily acceptable  forms of expression that comply with  male technical criteria and male fine  art.  I went to Rootworks with the desire to  learn what a feminist photograph is,- What  is it in the subject matter (realistic or  abstract), the compositional concerns  (light, shadow, space, pattern, texture),  that makes a feminist photograph a woman's  expression, and not just a photograph  taken by a woman? Or is there in fact  a difference?  The Ovular provided the ideal envirom-  ment. Ruth and Jean Mountaingrove pour  so much love into the land at Rootworks  that each visitor is affected by their  attitude of caring - we were not to pollute the soil, water or sound waves, hence  we enjoyed an environment that was  tranquil, clean and abundant in nurturing  creative energy. We were asked to give  positive feedback on each others' work,  and not to scrutinize (an attitude that  I feel must exist in order to avoid inhibiting another's creative expression.)  We shared our skills in the darkroom,  prepared meals together between shooting.  Between developing and waiting for negatives to dry we did our laundry. We  worked in groups to develop slide, and  collectively created fantasy images with  multiple exposures on the A  X 5 camera.  Out of the process of working together  came an intuitive awareness of each other's  ideas and how to build on them and best  represent our visions. The emphasis was  on picture^; images, fantasy...photographs.  The results of the week's work were  unbelievable. The photographs that we  made were beautiful, original works, such  as I have never seen before. By the time  that I left Rootworks I no longer saw the  camera as a complete tool unless it had  a woman attached to the eyepiece.  For instance, Diana worked with a "Diana"  camera (a plastic camera with a plastic  lens). She made slid.es of a woman bathing  at the stream, but because of the distortions in focus and perspective caused by the  lens and Dianas' ideas of perspective,  (shooting from below the subject toware  the sky), her woman appears strong, dreamlike, amazonian and very much a part of the  trees, sky and water around her.  One picture in this series particularly  appealed to me.  It was of a woman crouched  -by a pool in the stream. The woman's image,  the sky and the trees are reflected in the  pool adding a further distortion by nature  to the photograph.  I liked this imagery  because it seemed almost a visual pun to  have nature's lens reflect that ephemeral  sense of self that is otherwise invisible  to the human experience.  Shushana photographed scenes of the forest  and then double exposed them with shots  of open windows and window frames. The  black-and-white printed results gave an  illusion of windows existing in the woods  like cobwebs spun between the trees.  Because of the transparent rigidity of the  windows over the strong organic shapes of  the woods there was an intangible mystery  about the images. Curiously, on Shushanas'  d and documented the night before.  slides"' were much like charcoal drawings, with some sharp black lines, solid  black areas, and soft spaces of different  grey tones that moved into large white  spaces. This was most appropriate to the  subject and an interesting use of the negative for its own qualities.  Darlyne spent much of her time at Rootworks  documenting the housework. Her photographs  are insightful of the exchange of information possible in a communal environment, at  all levels of work. We shared our ways of  cooking, ways of printing photographs,  information on medicines, and on what other  women were doing in the towns where we  lived. Thus the housework was not an  isolated experience but of equal value with  other activities that day. Some particularly nice shots were of we women enjoying our  time bathing, at the same time washing out  undergarments and hanging them on the trees  to dry.  Lois projected some beautiful slides taken in  the black of night (there was no electricty  for miles around). Lois left her shutter  open and with a flashlight drew around her  subject which, in this case, was herself.  The results were slides with warm oranges  and browns and dark brown shapes. The  figure is apparent and her features are  somewhat visible, but the form is drawn  abstractly by the yellow light of the  flashlight. Lois' photographs captured  the atmosphere created by the subject almost  as though documenting her aura. Ambiguous,  beautiful work.  And there was more, Ruth Mountaingrove's  "projectogrammes" were images made under  the enlarger, using plants from around  Rootworks. She used solarization and  positive/negative paper printing to breakc  down the image into spatial designs, yet  retain the figurative illusion.  Much of my own work during this week re- .  volved around documenting Rootworks, the  women that I met there, the windchimes in  the trees, the land and the woods.  I left  Rootworks with a very high energy level.  I  felt nurtured, had shared my work and  creativity (the best part of myself) with  ten other women, who in turn had shared  their creativity with me.  I left feeling centred and aware of the  direction I should follow to develop my  expression as a woman. As a feminist  photographer I am expressing my woman experience to other women, such that they will  recognize some part of themselves. 18   Kinesis   Sept/Oct 8  WOMEN AT WORK  Single parent students: "We must believe in our strength"  By Luanne Armstrong  Susan Noonan is a single parent student at  the University of Victoria who has experienced the pain and problems shared by  other single parents at post-secondary  institutions across the province.  Noonan returned to school with her three  children after her marriage broke up and  says that her first year was riddled with  difficulties.  "We moved four times," she  says, "I don't know how we survived."  She adds that she went through a long  period of discovering her self and her  educational goals.  "My biggest problem was lack of self-  esteem," she says, "but the other side of  that was discovering my own strength.  I've learned from a lot of other people.  I've learned a lot about the strength of  my children; now they're sort of like  partners in my life.  I had no sense of  accomplishment in raising them before."  "I feel very strongly that this whole  experience has been a positive thing.  Whatever I have to cope with now is my  stuff, and I can deal with it or not  deal with it on my terms."  Another single parent student at UVic,  Carol Wilson, said she only managed to  survive because her mother looks after  Carol's son and houses them. Wilson  says she agrees with Noonan that the best  thing about being a single parent  student is her increased sense of self-  esteem and her so2\s new and obvious pride  in her.  She adds that it is important for single  parent students to believe in their own  strength.  "It's like being a prisoner. You don't  know if what you're doing is okay.  There's no affirmation from society but  the rewards are worth it," she said.  One of the biggest problems that single-  parent students must face is financial  worries. According to Nels Granewall,  UVic's head of financial aid his office  must attempt to correct a social problem  created both by the ministry of human  resources and the court system; the ministry because of their refusal to give  financial aid to single mother students  and the court system for allowing so many  fathers to default on their child-support  payments.  Granewall says the most Human Resources  will do is fund a year of education for  women if it leads directly to a job.  Occasionally, they will help a woman  through the last year of a four-year  program, but the emphasis on getting a job .  means that often women are shunted off  to low-paying service or secretarial jobs.  Granewall,says Human Resources are "taking  it upon themselves to make arbitrary  decisions as to how these women should  lead their lives."  Granewall adds that what is needed is a  subsidy, like the present daycare subsidy,  which assists low-income parents to pay  the costs of daycare. Children of■single  parent students should be recognized as  separate and in need of assistance apart  from their parents, he adds.  This would remove the stigma many women  still feel in applying for help from  Human Resources, and Granewall says it  would then allow him to help the single  parent mother with the regular funds provided to the university to help single  students.  Very few of the women Granewall sees receive child support payments from their  ex-husbands and those who do, receive in  adequate amounts, he adds. Family court  "doesn't have enough teeth to make the  errant father play his social role."  Granewall says many single parent students,  in order to finish their education, are  borrowing up to the limit allowed (about •  $10,000.00), some even before they have  finished school.  "It pains me to sit here and put them into  debt like that," he says, but with  limited funds he has no choice.  "The court  and guilt. Many of them, she says, are  still experiencing trauma from a divorce  or separation, and when they do return to  school, they often encounter a variety of  experiences and feelings.  Often, she says, they feel guilty over  leaving their children and "the general  guilt that society places on women who are  not playing a conventional role." They  are also driven by a tremendous need to  succeed at what they are doing. McKay  says, despite the pressure they are under,  of last resort happens to be my office. '.  believe I expound the philosophy of this  institution when I say that we wish to  see people who have had a rough deal in  life given a chance to correct that."  Another person at UVic that single parent  students can go to for a sympathetic ear  is Lucille McKay, head of Daycare Services,  and herself a former single parent.  She says many of the single parents with  children in daycare talk to her and the  other daycare workers about their problems  because they don't have anyone else to go  to.  But a year ago, McKay set up a counselling  group for single parent students through  Counselling Services, which has been very  successful.  McKay said in her experience, besides financial problems, many single parent students are dealing with emotional snxiety  the single parent students she has known  all do well.  "In five years, I can only think of one  person who has not made exceptional marks,"  she says, adding that she*s often thought  it would be more logical to expect them  to have nervous breakdowns.  McKay agrees with Granewall that money is  a huge problem for the majority of single  parent students, and adds that this  affects these women another way — it  deprives them of a chance for a normal  social life. She is currently trying to  get the University's recreational department to provide some low-cost family  recreation, such as an overnight camping  trip to Lake Cowichan.  Another problem, says McKay, is that UVic  has no residences for parents with  children. However, Housing Services says  there are no plans for any at this time. Q Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis    19  LESBIAN RIGHTS  Lesbian Conference: whereas... be it resolved that.  On May 16, 17 & 18 500 women attended the  1981 National Lesbian Conference at Langara  College in Vancouver.  It was a weekend  of cultural events, a march and workshops.  We have included here a summary of the  discussions and resolutions that came out  of the workshops.  A brochure detailing  the events of the conference will be mailed  later in the year. If you have any photos,  contact names or other submissions, please  send them by June 30, 1981 to:  Box 65563, Station F  Vancouver, B.C.  A conference evaluation meeting was held  on June 10, to provide an opportunity for  women to discuss the conference. Their  remarks were overwhelmingly positive.  Everyone showed appreciations for the  conference committee's hard work and organizing skills. Women described how excited, powerful, and connected they felt  during the conference.  One suggestion for future organizers was  that more women be encouraged to get involved in organizing the conference.  Women said that they want to help on a  smaller scale, without becoming a member  of the organising committee.  Some women  raised concerns about the scheduling and  the number of workshops.  There was also  a suggestion that at the final plenary  more time be provided to discuss the resolutions. A more detailed account of the  meeting will appear in the post-conference  brochure.  Workshops at the conference were very well  attended - some had upwards of 60 women  participating. Nearly three-quarters of  the more than 500 who had registered  throughout the conference crowded in for  the plenary on Monday afternoon, when the  workshop resolutions were presented.  The overall resolution of the conference  was presented at that time:  IT WAS RESOLVED BY THE MAJORITY OF CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS THAT REGIONAL CONFERENCES BE HELD NEXT YEAR, FOLLOWED BY A  NATIONAL LESBIAN CONFERENCE IN 1983.  A meeting to begin organizing the B.C. Regional Conference was held on June 24th at  Britannia Community Centre.  Lesbians on the job   Rural Lesbians: There were women from the  Fraser valley, Kootenays, the Island, the  Okanagan, Quebec, Yellowknife and the U.S.  Discussion focused on:  1. Ending isolation  2. Coming out in the country  3. Collective process and problems  U.  Pacing our work and avoiding  country burn-out  There were country-city exchanges and the  beginning of support networks.  Contact Number: RLA  c/o Amazon  Box 6, R.R. 1  Ruskin V0M IRC  Lesbian Mothers and Child Custody: Lesbian  mothers have the least time and mobility of  lesbians and too often undergo the trauma  of custody battles lasting years.  We need the emotional support of childless  women and the physical support and access  to lesbian resources, phone lines, drop-ins  in women's centres, for our outreach and  legal work that we will be undertaking in  cities all across the country.  We're looking forward to a new level of  co-operation between mothers and non-  mothers in a lesbian movement that recognizes all our needs.  We ask that anyone who knows the name of a  good lawyer or legal clinic anywhere in  Canada please send that information to the  Lesbian Mothers Defence Fund in Toronto.  Contact number: LMDF  Box 38, Stn. E.  Toronto, MSG' 3E1  Mothering Workshop: Resolutions:  1. Whereas more than 80$ of women have  children  Be it Resolved: that we will actively encourage women mothering children to attend  lesbian and feminist events by providing  high quality daycare for children who come  and sharing costs with women who need home  child care. Events must stop if childcare  isn't adequate until the problem is resolved.  2. Whereas children of lesbian and/or feminist mothers have difficulty fitting into   W$i&S  the straight system because their home-  taught values are different and whereas  these children are often isolated from each  other  Be it Resolved: that we set up support  systems where our children can meet and be  with each other on a regular basis.  3. Whereas when children are seen as the  private possession and sole responsibility  of their parents and this leads to the isolation and oppression of both children and  mothers  Be it Resolved: that we find ways to take  more community responsibility to and for  our children.  4. Whereas the current daycare subsidy is  completely inadequate, especially penalizing single women with children and whereas  many parents work evenings and/or weekends  Be it Resolved: that we support the fight  for daycare subsidies to be raised to cover  the real costs of daycare and keep families  above the poverty line and that some centres  be open on a 24 hour and 7 day a week  basis.  5. Whereas the current child tax credit  exemption benefits the privileged and family allowance is given to everybody and  whereas children and their parents must endure the oppression of poverty  Be it Resolved: that we support the concept  that tax refunds be given to families to  bring low incomes above the poverty line.  6. Be it Resolved: that we work on having  sex education in schools address the total  concept of human relationships rather than  reinforces heterosexuality as it does now.  Contact Number:  LAFMPAG  251-5034  Women in Prison Workshop: Seeing that  prisons are where the State has ultimate  control over womyn, we felt it essential  that womyn organizing around violence  against womyn, rape crisis intervention/  self-defense and so on, become aware of and  expose the violence that womyn locked away  experience all the time. This aspect of  violence against womyn MUST be included  with the important work already being done,  and it must be done with the mutual support  of the street womyn and the prisoners and  ex-prisoners.  Repression in the form of a Police State  is on the increase and that we all owe it  to ourselves to educate ourselves about  our legal rights; the details of the technological surveillance and control used by  the gov't and police against us; and the  role of law enforcement in a patriarchal,  capitalist society.  We also understood that fighting against  prisons is to the advantage of every feminist activist because it could be me or  you behind those bars!  Contact person: Women Against Prisons  P.O. Box 46571,St. G  Vancouver, B.C.  Phone: 879-4741,253-1227  Lesbian Students Workshop: The first group  discussed the lack of lesbian content in  Women's Studies courses and the homophobia  of Women's Studies professors brought  about by their general fear of losing students and funding.  It was agreed that we must network. At  the local level we must share expertise in  setting up women's centres.  Nationally  we must share information on universities,  courses and disciplines.  The second group discussed providing assistance such as counselling for those who ■  are coming out.  They also discussed how to get more Lesbians involved in women's centres and how  to build a network amongst the lesbians in  that centre.  Suggestions were:using the local talent of  professionals for workshops such as women  and sexuality.  Another idea was to have a coffeehouse or  concert to draw a lot of support from lesbians off campus, as well as a source of  fund raising.  Lesbians and Welfare Workshop:  Be it  Resolved that there be a recognition of  lesbian mothers living below the poverty  line. Our skills and experiences have been  a significant part of the construction of  the women's movement.  We demand that all women recognize and  share their privileges, in terms of free  time, money, access to education, access  to information and skill development, and  access to the celebrations of our culture.  Spirituality-  Matriarchal Spirituality Workshop: We  agreed that ritual has been twisted and  abused by the patriarchy.  And that it is a "woman craft" skill to use  colour, sounds, movement to heal, protect  and/or overcome the restrictions placed on  us by a patriarchial society who by constant persecution of the craft and skills  of our foremothers are recognizing the  threat we pose to the economic and social  power held by male-dominated religions.  Lesbians & Traditional Religion:  Be it Resolved: that we should not make  anyone else's spiritual choice or judge  them for that choice.  Lesbian sexuality-  Lesbian Sex: This workshop was attended by  100 women, approximately one quarter of the  Conference registrants.  As a result of the workshop, sexuality  discussion groups are forming in Toronto  and Vancouver.  Our resolution is in ► 20   Kinesis   Sept/Oct £  LESBIAN RIGHTS  support of a weekend National Lesbian Sex  Conference. Two hours wasn't enough.  Violence in Relationships Workshop: While  we do not condone violent acts we understand the need to address the issue  Be it Resolved: that self-help support  groups be run that would address the issue  of non-consensual violence between women:  that Lesbian therapists become familiar  with the dynamics of non-consensual violence among women.  that women acknowledge that violence can  exist in themselves and in their relationships.  It is necessary to abandon judgemental attitudes so that we can openly discuss difficulties in this area.  "Coming Out" Workshop: During this workshop a guided fantasy was used to facilitate women .focusing on how they might  move to take back power in a recent, true  confrontative or uncomfortable situation  regarding their lesbianism.  A number of women had trouble with the  fantasy - they felt they could do little  or nothing to change the outcome of the  incident or that they could feel better  about themselves. As we talked about this  it became clear that individually and collectively we must work to combat it.  Suggestions offered to make coming out  easier were to:  1. Talk to at least one other person about  it as often as you need to.  2. Enlist support from other lesbians in  whatever action you are undertaking and  support what others are doing - even if you  are not out actively involved you can donate money or time, etc.  3. Work to transform fear into caution and  then take small steps to reclaim power -  i.e. come out to one trusted friend at  work rather than the whole staff; confront  whenever it isn't "dangerous" on a personal  level.  4. Build support for all of us by talking  to straights you are out to about what is  happening. Give them facts to work with as  well as your feeling so that they can in  turn talk to others.  5. Support other lesbians whatever their  choice is about coming out - we all need  each other now.  Non-Monogamy Workshop:  Resolutions:  1. Our sexuality as women is changing and  organic. We may be celibate at certain  periods of our lives, monogamous at others,  and non-monogamous in various combinations.  2. The importance of honesty and clarity  in our relationships, whether sexual or  other, is similar in monogamous/non-monogamous commitments.  3. Our ability to love, grow and change  requires a commitment to seeing each other  within the context of a system of relationships and social networks. Labelling is  politically incorrect, not monogamy, celibacy or any form of our sexual expression  as lesbians.  Monogamy Workshop: Resolved that:  1. Being monogamous is a personal choice.  2. Being monogamous is not politically  incorrect.  3. Lesbians must respect and support personal choice regarding lifestyle.  4. Monogamous couples can and should be  positive role models for lesbians.  5 Lesbians must dispell the myths regarding monogamy (i.e. monogamy as it relates  to the traditional heterosexual model).  Bisexuality Workshop: About 30 bisexual  women attended the workshop. About 5 non-  bisexual lesbians also attended.  Feelings expressed were anger, isolation,  and alienation due to our rejection by the  lesbian movement. At the same time there  was a strong political desire to work with  the lesbian movement for our-liberation as  women who love women. As bisexual feminists  we need to meet and talk and give support  to each other now because our isolation has  been intense.  We need to talk to each other in an environment which is guilt-free and non-defensive. We plan to meet in the future.  Lesbians Organizing .  Celibacy Workshop: There was a  about the great variety of experiences  while celibate: pain, aloneness, and energy  centering which bring strong creative,  spiritual and self-directive experiences.  In the media ;   Lesbians & Publishing: We made plans to  work toward forming a national association  for feminist print media and a distribution  network.  Communications Workshop: We spent the majority of our time talking about the magazine - L/L Lesbian/Lesbienne which was approved by last plenary of the 1979 Lesbian  Conference.  The first and only issue was given out and  ways and means of continuing the magazine  as a national forum went around.  Resolved that: Articles and news of various regions would also be accompanied by  a small amount of money to help print it.  2. Lesbian groups, specifically Lesbians  Against the Right, should look to the magazine for communication of news and co-ordination of actions.  3. A monthly shorter news bulletin with a  possible longer quarterly with analysis of  action and other news.  4. That everything be in both French and  English.  5. That Toronto continue to be used as  the "clearing house" and printing facility.  Lesbians and Visual Arts Workshop: There  was a discussion about how lesbianism related to our artwork and the role of artists  in lesbian liberation.  Media Workshop:  Resolutions:  1. To promote the effective use of  "straight" media by:  -developing a list of press contacts and a  press strategy  -add media contacts to a contact list at  the plenary.  -follow up all press releases with a personal phone call  -use a tip sheet for handling the media  which was compiled by the media workshop  women and will be included in the post-  conference mailing  2. To promote the effective use of alternative medias in our own cities and to develop our own media wherever possible.  3. To form a network to connect lesbians  in other cities by compiling a media contact list.  4. Request for consideration that not all  lesbians can afford to come out. Caution  should be used in identifying individuals.  Lesbians and the Women's Movement:  We resolved:  1. to establish an informal network.  2. to hold a Lesbian/feminist conference  on a provincial regional basis.  3-  to have workshops on Lesbian/Feminism  across Canada (sharing skills) held on  weekends.  4. to establish lesbian caucuses within  women's committees of organizations.  5. to continue to develop a lesbian/feminist analysis through discussion, research  and writing.  Young Lesbians Association: We discussed  the law, psychiatric institutions, MHR, and  other institutions that oppress young lesbians.  We also discussed the importance of younger  lesbians in the women's community continuing to keep the movement radical.  Fighting the Right Workshop:  Be it resolved that this conference call  for a Lesbian Day of Protest vs. the Right  to be organized in as many centres as possible on Nov. 28/81 or April 10/82.  This day could include education outreach,  a march and rally.  It would be one of the  first major activities of local anti-right  organizations and local groups would decide who they choose to ally with and what  format would be used. Educational activities outlined in Resolution One could be  used to build this day of action. Two-three  contacts should be established in each  centre (possible list, Vancouver will mail  out).  1.  Resolved that following this conference  Regional groups of lesbians against the  right be organized in both metropolitan &  rural areas.  That these group activities could include:  - outreach and education about right-wing  activities to unorganized lesbians in our  communities  - public education aimed at unions,schools,  neighbourhoods, immigrant and minority  groups, women, feminists and gays  -establishing regional alliances with other  groups under attack who will support our  - support Lesbian/Lesbienne with contributions and dollars  - undertake local research on Right activities  - help create a pamphlet which can be used  for education  - organizing a Lesbian Day of Education &  Protest vs. the Right  2. Be it Resolved: that we create an out-  • line of a bi-national pamphlet to be used  in local areas for education.  - that women in Eastern Canada take responsibility around translation  - that there be two contact women; one in  Toronto, one in Vancouver to co-ordinate  the creation of the pamphlet.  3. Be it Resolved: that Lesbian/Lesbienne  be published every two months and that local anti-right wing groups contribute to it  with local information and dollars.  - that Toronto continue to co-ordinate and  publish the newsletter until the Day of  Protest  - that lesbians in English Canada assist  with translation of the newsletter into  French.  Lesbians and the Gay Movement:  We resolved:  1. that steps be taken to ensure more support for lesbians working on this front.  2. that due to the gravity of social dis-^ Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis   21  LESBIAN RIGHTS  crimination against gay people, alliances  with gay men for the rights of Lesbians and  gay men be recognized.  3. that a network system be strengthened,  across the country.  From Theory to Action: Using the Lesbian/  Feminist Workshop Manual:  About 50 women attended from all over B.C.,  Canada and some from America.  Presentation  re: coming to terms with emotional reactions to lesbianism, creating an analysis  connecting lesbianism and feminism and encouraging women to take action both personal  and political.  Women from Calgary, Nanaimo, Winnipeg and  Toronto committed themselves to organizing  workshops.  The Workshop Collective plans travelling  across the country in the fall.  Contact number: Stepping Out of Line  c/o Press Gang Publishers  603 Powell St., Vancouver  Lesbians of Colour:  We resolved: that we form a semi-formal  support/study education and action group  around our need to evaluate and understand  our oppression as racial minorities.  We are agreed that it is important and  necessary to educate, define and analyze  our distinct position within the greater  context of the women's movement.  Contact number: Lesbians of Colour  c/o Lesbian Conference/81  Box 65563, Stn. F  Vancouver, B.C.  Lesbians in Quebec/Francophone Lesbians  Out of Quebec:  The workshop was attended by Lesbians from  Quebec, Lesbian Francophones recently living in Anglophone regions, Anglophone lesbians with French roots and Anglophone lesbians interested in the situation in  Quebec.  Lesbians from Quebec, living in B.C. talked  about their perceptions of the differences  between the two cultures; the good ones &  the hard ones. We also talked about the  inevitability of assimilation...(sigh).  How can we, as Quebecoise, ask for recognition of ourselves and not get defensive  reactions from Anglophone Lesbians?  Whereas:  There are obvious differences of  language and culture between Francophone  lesbians in Quebec and in Canada and Anglophone lesbians and that these obvious differences create barriers of communications  between all of us lesbians, and that it is  by recognizing and by being up front about  the realities of our differences that we  will create unity, in spite of and using  the power of our language, cultural, class  differences,  Be it Resolved: that we as lesbians take  responsibility for increasing the level of  communication between the two cultures by  1. finding translation resources  2. by using existing media vehicles carrying information about lesbianism of and in  the two communities.  Whereas: Francophone lesbians living in,  visiting or moving in Anglophone regions/  cities, suffer from isolation caused by the  differences of language and culture, and  that, we as lesbians, have a responsibility  for taking care of and giving support to  those of us who fight additional oppressions such as language, culture, race, class,  physical disabilities, etc.  Therefore Be it Resolved: that lesbian  individuals and groups in Anglophone regions/cities act as contacts for Francophone lesbians and  1. introduce them to other Francophone  lesbian women  2. give them information about Francophone  resources  3.  introduce them to the lesbian and women's community and movement.  Disabled Lesbians: We discussed the need  for transportation, signing, accessible  spaces and home services. We shared information about resources, self-help groups,  contact women and published material. We  discussed outreach through associations &  and condition of power for lesbians, in  particular:  1. how to conceive  2. fertility awareness  3. creating sperm donor network  Resolved:  1. To use the Vancouver Women's Health  Collective as a centre for out-of-town  women to receive and send info on subject  of alternative fertilization.  2. To set up meeting to establish liaisons  with political gay homosexual community for  the purpose of obtaining a list of donors.  Healing Reality Workshop: The workshop was  limited to 15 lesbians so that we could  fully appreciate the experience of touching the magic within us and drawing it out  with our sisters.  Politics of Madness Workshop: Some suggestions and ideas explored were:  .•esources for the disabled and talked  about including women with physical problems who do not consider-themselves disabled .  L.I.L. of Vancouver and the Lesbian Resources Centre of Seattle are planning outreach. We talked about the need for emotional, practical and social support within our community. We proposed to put on  an event as a group, organized with a first  priority on our needs as disabled lesbians.  We would invited able-bodied lesbians.  Contact person: Reva at  Lesbian Information Line  The Lesbian body.  Report from the Sports Workshop: We resolved to work to promote a positive image  of strong, autonomous women in sport.  Report from the Sports Workshop:  Resolved that: 1. We would-work to promote  a positive image of strong, autonomous  women in sport.  2. That sport is a great opportunity for  lesbian and straight women to get together  and break down the barriers between us.  3. That we will set up a meeting with  Sports B.C. to discuss "affirmative action"  for girls and women in sport—how to encourage more women to develop their physical potential and participate and how to  encourage women coaches and administrative  personnel in sport.  4. That we will make available a resource  list of sports teams and facilities through  the final Conference Report.  Contact person: Lesbian Conference Cmte,  P.O.Box 65563,Stn. F  Vancouver, B.C.  Alternative Fertilization: We talked about  the politics of reproduction and alternative fertilization methods to reclaim pregnancy and childbearing as a viable choice  1. the formation of a feminist-oriented  mental patients liberation group in Vancouver .  2. value of psychoanalysis and feminist/  lesbian analysis as an alternative.  3. the internalization of homophobia.  4. how Vancouver Legal Aid can help get  someone to Riverview.  5. how to deal with anger.  6. that sometimes we do stop functioning  and need somewhere to go.  7. colour therapy  Incest Survivors: Women opened themselves  and shared their pain. It was a touching,  moving experience to see and feel lesbians  loving, trusting and supporting.  There is an incest group happening every  Tuesday and Thursday at West End Community  Centre in Vancouver. Phone: 687-7994  Personal Support Systems Workshop Or Where  the Hell are My Sisters When I Meed Them?  This group discussed why it is important  to support each other, what is supportive  and what is not.  Lesbians and Health Care Workshop:  Resolutions:  1. To attempt to educate health care  practitioners, about the specific needs of  lesbians.  2. To support each other to gain the  skills and knowledge necessary to take better care of ourselves.  3. To form health groups in the city to  share information, e.g. doing our own pap  tests, breast self-exam, learning about  herbs, massage, other alternatives.  Addiction Workshop: There were representatives from Alcoholics Anonymous, Women  for Sobriety, Aurora House, Addicted Women's Network. They presented their programs and opened discussion.  For more details, contact the conference  committee c/o 65563, Station F, Vancouver. 22    Kinesis    Sept/Oct 8  LETTERS  Separatism: a principled stand  Dear Kinesis:  In our article titled "Who We Are and What  We Do", printed in the February '81 issue  of Kinesis we said:  Feminist separatism is not a practical  idea. For most of the women in the world,  it is not even remotely an option.. .You  can't even walk to the corner store without dealing with men. To imagine that we  can lock ourselves away from them is foolish. Separatism is only even marginally  possible for' a privileged group of white,  middle class women..."  Through direct criticism we have learned  our mistake. We failed to state our collective position and practice regarding  lesbianism.  We are regretful and hope that this information will counteract the effect of our  mistake.  We think it important that we include this  statement of our position and practice for  the following reasons: 1) it lessens the  possibility of our being used to hurt  lesbians, 2) because it challenges the  assumption that all women are heterosexual  unless otherwise stated, 3) it challenges  the assumption that only lesbians are referred to when we talk about feminist  tism.  want her to have a chance to explain her  point of view.  It is important to find ways to criticize  someone's actions or ideas without implying that the person is stupid or bad. We  do not want to make each other afraid to  take action, or afraid to put forward  ideas, because the criticism we will receive if we are mistaken, or if others  think we are mistaken, is so devastating.  Our collective position is that lesbianism is an act which creates choice for  women, and as feminists we are clearly in  support of lesbian and gay rights.  To this end we have marched in Lesbian and  Gay Pride marches,' sent speakers to rallies  about Lesbian and Gay Rights, formed a  Lesbian caucus within the support/education  action groups we facilitate, formed a cross  Canada Lesbian caucus within the Canadian  Association of Sexual Assault Centres, and  have sent formal representation to the  recent Lesbian Conference in Vancouver.  We argue that separating into women only  groups is often useful as a political base  for confronting male supremacy, but if  the purpose and/or practice of women only  groups is to avoid confronting male supremacy, we believe that practice to be  destructive to the long term goal of achieving our liberation.  If you have any questions please contact  us at 872-8212.  Val Ogle/Joni Miller  Vancouver Rape Relief  Ideas useful, right or wrong  Dear Kinesis:  Thank you for the note letting me  know my letter was being replied to in  the August issue.  I don't know how the  other women who came up with the suggestions I put forward in my letter feel  about it, but to me your arguments make  sense.  Since it is impractical for a number of  reasons for Kinesis  to see that criticisms  and replies are published simultaneously,  we must take individual responsibility for  informing each other when we plan to be  publicly critical of each other's ideas  or actions. There is no need for us to  feel personally attacked when someone  explains why she thinks our political  ideas are mistaken. When we don't feel  personally attacked, we are more apt to  listen to the other person's arguments  with an open mind. Letting a person know  that we are about to criticize their  actions or ideas publicly is a way of  demonstrating that our purpose is not to  hurt the person criticized, and that we  We are not, or should not be, engaged in  a competition to see which of us can  present the most politically correct  image, but in a mutual and supportive  search for ideas and principles that  will help us act in a politically correct fashion. (By politically correct'  I mean 'conducive to ending power hierarchies in general, and the power of men  over women in particular, throughout  society.')  Someone's mistaken ideas, clearly and  strongly argued, can be just as useful  to us as correct ones, because in working  out why we disagree with their ideas, we  deepen our own analysis.  When an individual or group is criticized  in Kinesis  we can also take individual  responsibility for either withholding  judgment of the criticism for a month, or  else contacting the person or group criticized to hear what the response to the  criticism is.  Lee MacKay  Lifeline's in the soup . .  Dear Kinesis:  Enclosed is a copy of the cover of Lifeline,   the VGH magazine and a copy of the  letter sent to the magazine 's editor from  the Women's Health Collective.    Looks  like the medical boys are still needing a  little titillation to get them through that  tedious medical literature!  Editor, Lifeline magazine:  We recently received a copy of the June  1981 issue of Lifeline magazine. We are  upset that to focus the cover on the lead  article on Dermatology, your magazine chose  the nude picture of a woman.  There are no visible rashes, scars, or  other dermatological physical findings on  this woman's skin. And so we assume that  you chose this photograph for particularly  that purpose — to show some skin.  You chose a young woman, neatly revealing  the outline of her breast and behind, but  without being "in bad taste" by showing  some photograph blatantly pornographic.  Likewise on page 4> the photo is of a  young woman with bare shoulder, top of  breast, and head demurely slanted to the  side. The article is entitled "Skin  Deep".  We are angry about the cover of your magazine and the picture on page four. Does a  resident in dermatology need such a stimu  lus to keep him awake to read medical  literature? Does he need it planted in  his mind the next time he examines a young  woman that there is a sexuality about the  examination that he can turn on to? Does  he make his young women patients undress  into a gown, while his older women patients  just need roll up their sleeve for a look?  We think there continues to be enough  sexism in the medical industry without  encouragement from the largest hospital in  the community. We would like an apology  for an inappropriate and sexist choice of  illustration of a medical field that includes people of all ages, sexes, and  races on the inside cover of your next  issue.  Rebecca Fox  Vancouver Women's Health Collective  I hereby divorce myself  from "MAN" . . .  Dear Kinesis:  I find myself compelled to respond to the  brief article by Ruth Meecham which appeared in your June '81 issue.  Once again, I/we face the charge of failing  to "co-operate with" men. Here goes the  same tired old argument...Ms. Meecham is  certainly entitled to her opinion, but I  for one feel we have nothing to gain by  co-operating with men.--  I am a radical feminist. I believe men  oppress wimmin through the institutions of  patriarchy. Men, the creators, perpetuators  and "beneficiaries" of patriarchy, are the  "enemy" against which our energy must be  directed. It is naive to assume that, if  given able leadership and incentive (what,  I might ask, is sufficient incentive to  sacrifice power?), they will willingly  change their ways. Men have a vested interest in the continued oppression of  women. It is the source of their power  and privilege in this society and others.  I think too much time/gynergy is wasted  defending/nurturing/supporting men.  If we  could harness all that beautiful wimmin's  energy for the Movement...but it is drained  in countless ways.  They enslave our bodies - often against our  will - to bear their  sons, then stake their  claims.on the Infants we carried and bore  and suckled.  They rape, assault, harass, and beat us.  They degrade and humiliate us with pornography. They carefully perpetuate demeaning stereotypes through advertising, media,  culture, etc. to ensure we are how they  wish us to be.  They deny us abortions and safe, effective  birth control; they deny us economic power;  exempt us from political process; from  social equality.  They enforce our powerlessness through  poverty (what womyn will have time for  activism when her greatest concern is to  pay the rent and feed her children each  month? ) They use the dogma of religion  to justify and perpetuate our subordination.  I am certainly not denying that - sadly -  they have our complicity in some of this.  They have their female allies. I can hardly  call Grace McCarthy or Phyllis Schlafly  "sister". Many wimmin have been seduced  by the baubles, co-opted by the smell of  patriarchal power. Indeed, they too often  have our tacit, silent co-operation.  This is not to say that men themselves, as  individuals, are necessarily aware of or  deliberate in their oppression of wimmin  ...but oppression is achieved and maintained through the institutions of the  patriarchal society they  have created.  They have nothing to gain by changing it.► Sept/Oct 81    Kinesis   23  MOVEMENT MATTERS  Some shrewd enough to perceive the "threat"  of feminism, have stepped up their misogyny.  The right-wing backlash spreading, like the  plague around the world, is no accident.  While many men may not participate actively  in the oppression of wimmin, may even believe it wrong  (to give them the benefit  of the doubt), they appear unwilling to  challenge the sacred assumptions of their  peers.  I don't believe we can (or should) count  on their co-operation. I don't want to see  us wasting time/energy courting their  "help". We are 50% of the population. We  must reach our sisters.  And, most importantly, we must reach our children -  leave  them a new set of values to operate from.  There are, I agree, a few  individuals of  the male sex worthy of our respect, but  on the whole, 99% of them cannot (will not)  change their mind-set. I live with one of  those very special men. He understands  and agrees with  what I have to say about  men; and more than that (talk is cheap),  he supports me and the Movement  actively.  (So, Ruth, I am not a lesbian, but I have  no doubt that I would be  if I were not in  this very satisfying, egalitarian relationship. )  As for Ms. Meecham's feelings on the use of  various "mis-spellings" of the word  "woman"... she has resolved my  conflict  over this. I have no  desire to be part of  huMANity, to be a lesser female appendage  of the creature who has wreaked havoc and  destruction on this planet.  To me, there is nothing honourable or  noble about huMANity, starry-eyed rhapsodizing to the contrary. HuMANity...with  its ongoing slaughter of innocent creatures; its rape and poisoning of Mother  Earth; its supertankers and toxic chemicals;  its constant bloodbath of war and violence;  its power struggles and juntas and pogroms;  its bigotry and hatred, torture and witchhunts; its fascination with technology;  and its driving obsession with ensuring a  slow nuclear death for us all.  I do not wish to be an accomplice to this  destruction. I hereby divorce myself from  MAN and embrace the word "WOMYN". (I might  also add that when any new word enters the  language, it will feel awkward on the  tongue. We are however, entitled to, and  worthy of, a female language.)  Wimmin, on the other hand, have great  creative potential. If we can mobilize  our aggression to create the chance to  use our caring, nurturing, creative energies, we can  create a better world. But I  doubt we can expect any but a very few  men to join in this process.  She also advocates that we "forgive" rapists who have "realized their mistake". I  am not about to welcome with open arms any  man who has raped a sister, however sincere his repentance.  I do want to add that I believe it took  courage for Ms. Meecham to share her views  with us and, in effect, attempt to chastise us. It is, for me, one of the beauties of the Movement that this kind of  exchange can happen.  In sisterhood, Pam Blackstone  Women's Building society prepares bid  The picture shown above is of the old post  office and former RCMP headquarters at the  corner of 16th and Main, now open for tenders for lease or purchase.  The Women's Building Society of Vancouver  has decided to try it. We realize there  will be stiff competition, but with our  stamina and drive, we feel we can certainly be in the running and gain recognition  for the need for a women's building.  Slowly but surely we are making progress -  we are incorporated as a non-profit society  in B.C. and now have a federal tax exemption number as a charitable organization.  We are concentrating our energies on preparing a prospectus; this will be a complete proposal of what/how we envision the  components of a women's building. It will  serve as a valuable tool for fund raising,  both to the private and public sectors.  We want to create our own space and put an  end to unnecessary struggling. Most of us  know what it is like arranging a dance:  the problems finding a hall, and all the  restrictions you come up against when you  do find one.  We deserve our own space, so rather than  complain about our oppression, why not  work together to put an end to it? WE NEED  YOU TO WORK WITH US IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE  OUR GOAL!  Any woman is welcome to attend our meetings  . The next one will be on Thursday, Sept. 24,  7:00pm at Vancouver Status of Women, 400A  West 5th Ave. (at Yukon). Or feel free to  call Gloria at 736-0636 (p.m.) for information regarding a women's building in  Vancouver.  We also need women who know about, or have  had some experience with a prospectus. If  you are unable to attend our meetings, or  to phone, please write us at our P.O. Box  66017, Station F, Vancouver V5N 5L4.  Women in Focus needs our support  Women in Focus moved into a large, bright  open space in February 1981. The move has  been good in many ways. We now have a lot  more space for video and film production  and showings, gallery exhibitions, our work  of distributing our media library of 80  video and film productions by women across  Canada, our upcoming 'new music' series in  November, and women's events of all kinds.  It also gives the women's community of  Vancouver a place to hold coffee houses,  dances, and other cultural and entertainment events.  BUT...we still have the problem of insufficient funding. We have not yet been able  to squeeze more than one wage of $800 per  month out of funding agencies, with a  little more for rent and general upkeep.  This makes a major problem in keeping the  centre operational. If you would like to  see us continue to operate, we need your  help  in the following ways:  * write us a support letter (contact us for  more information  * make a donation of money or goods, and we  will issue you a tax-deductible receipt  * support the centre by attending our  events; you can pick up a calendar at the  centre  * rent our video, film and slide productions; ask for a free catalogue  * rent the space for the next event you  organize; rates are $15/hour (with special consideration given to non-profit  events that are organized by women who  have no money), $140/night for dances  * we need volunteer help of all kinds and  we desperately need a fund-raiser  * we are looking for an efficient, business  oriented woman with an arts background to  take on the responsibility of organizing  the second year of 'Matronize', the display of-invited artists' work for the  ' month of December, with a view to Christmas sales. The organizer will work on a  commission basis.  Lastly, our great thanks to all those women  who have supported us in the past. With your  continued support and help from others we  shall keep the only women's arts and media  centre in Western Canada alive and well.
