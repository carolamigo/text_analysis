Twenty-minutes to deadline  we found a wonderfully embarrassing story by Baxter in a 10-year-old copy of Kinesis when  we were panicking and looking for something lost and blue (a pencil) an hour ago. Betty, if  you want to keep it quiet, please call.... Anyway, if you don't know who any of those women  are, you're probably reading some of the right publications. We do and we promise  something sharp and anal-y tical and cutting and...informative of all these candidates for the  next federal election. Have we already told you the one about the...?  Oops. Seventeen minutes and counting.  Ooops again. Did we forget to congratulate Kim for being the first woman prime  minister of Canada, oops.  Don't know if any of you read the Globe and Male? We have to. It's a curse o' the job. Well,  Gwynne Basen, the NAC rep from Montreal who wrote on new reproductive technologies  in our last issue (and also the Globe—we got the long, especially-for Kinesis version. Anyway,  she's been getting a lot of mail in that dreary, right-wing rag. One letter we saw was from  Patricia Baird, chair of the Royal Commission on NRTs...their LONG-awaited report is due  out this month. We'll bring you some more on that in September.  Also out in mid-July are the proposed changes to regulations under the Immigration  Act: the latest attack is targeted at the abilities of applicants for immigrant status to speak  English and French. There's some kind of horrendous score card that Immigration Board  bureaucrats keep to rate the desirability of immigrants...for many reasons, they score you  high on the list if you speak English or French...  Fourteen minutes and counting...we had a whole bunch of international "meanwhiles"  lined up., .let's see, more women and children were killed "accidentally" by American bombs  in Somalia last month...meanwhile, in Germany, the Chancellor has finally taken action on  the intense right-wing violence against people of colour in Germany. We're just not sure  whose side he's on. He's curbing immigration at the borders (so the "problem" will go  away?) but he also announced last month that Turkish immigrants will be given German  citizenship! Will that help? It may but not really. They don't look at passports before....  We heard some pretty bad stuff down at Legal Services the other day...something about  budget cuts to Native Programs and Education in the tune of SI0,000...there's more and we  will bring you that in September...  Ten minutes or less...We had to drop four pages of this issue almost at the last  moment.. .the morning we went to press. This morning. Some very bad luck. Lost a story. We  will bring you a three page, never-done-before, debate on pornography, violence against  women, and anti-censorship soon! Many many apologies. It was getting close to the end of  a three-day wait to get that story in then suddenly...we lost it.  Some announcements as we go into the eight minute. There are about five calls for  manuscripts/submissions...since we don't publish in July, we'd like to mention them here  so you know (if we can find them all—we're in the sixth minute now..)...South End Press is  looking for manuscripts on Ethnicity, Race, Gender and Activism. Write Sonia Shah, South  End Press, 116 Saint Botolph Street, Boston MA 02115.  In case you live in Vancouver, beware. The city is planning to turn Queer in September.  Yes, there will be lesbian and gay billboards everywhere in town, and many, other  OUTrageous things...The whole thing's called Queer City got a call to put the word out  about a show by women of colour and First Nations Women at the Pitt Gallery, 317 West  Hastings Street. Submit your work or just go in and crayon the wall. I hear that's okay. Ask  before you put crayon to wall—we just ma y have got it mixed up with some other show... .it's  on in September as part of Queer city...speaking of Queer, there is a terrific critical article  in the Brit paper Trouble & Strife, on Queer culture this month. If you live in Vancouver, the  Status of Women will have a copy...probably many/some women's centres...we have an  exchange with them...they get Kinesis and we hope they appreciate it.  Another Call for submissions..."But Where Are You Really From?" An Anthology on  Identity and Assimilation in Canada. For non-white and mixed race women. Write: Identity,  Sister Vision Press, P.O. Box 217, Stn. E. Toronto, Ontario, M6H 4E2  Five minutes to press...no, it's time. The courier's at the door. We'll sneak a couple more  in. Hot Flashes Women's Cafe on 106 Superior Street in Victoria, BC, has a video night on  July 23...  Wish we could talk about something that's happening provincially or across the  country...even Toronto...but we have heard all's quiet out there...the election's coming up  and I guess that's keeping everyone quietly keyed up... not us, we're off for a month and  there's lots happening.the Summer Institute for Union Women is on, there's the Powell  and the Folk Fests...the courier's here and she's late...but gave us time to make sure this isn't  all tha t sloppy after all.. .hope it makes sense!

JULY/AUGUST 1993 News  BC and Yukon Association of Women's Centres:  Organization divided  by Fatima Jaffer and Juline  Macdonnell   The BC and Yukon Association of Women's Centres (BC&Y) is in crisis. So much so  that it became nearly impossible for the 65  representatives from the BC&Y to agree on  anything over three days in May at what was  supposed to be the a ssocia tion's annua 1 general meeting and conference in Vancouver.  "Basically, we never carried out the  business of the AGM," says Janet Reid who  represents the Lower Mainland B region. "I  don't think there were any decisions made  that weekend. It was a free for all."  As a result, the two co-chairs of the  steering committee, Jennifer Johnstone of  the Vancouver Status of Women and Louise  Hara of the Port Coquitlam Women's Centre, quit. The steering committee, formerly  made up of five elected representatives, has  dissolved.  What came out of the AGM was a lack  of unity among the women present from the  41 member groups of the BC&Y. This had to  do with a number of historical, political,  organizational and personal factors.  For this story, Kinesis tried to interview  23 women who were at the AGM. Five refused to answer questions for reasons ranging from "this is an internal matter" and  "wanting control over what gets printed" to  being "unable to speak for my centre." Four  did not return Kinesis' calls. We regret the  voices missing in this piece.  Set up about eight yearsagoas a way for  women's centres across BC and the Yukon to  network on a provincial level, BC&Y's focus  initially was on sha ring programs and ideas,  lobbying for funding and taking on one or  two issues a year. The association currently  has 41 member centres.  But when the federal government cut  core funding to women's centres across the  country in 1990, the focus of the organization changed. After women occupied Secretary of State's offices, demanding funding  be restored and won, BC&Y stepped up its  efforts to lobby BC's ruling Socreds and the  NDP to do their part in meeting the funding  obligation to women's centres.  The provincial NDP promised they  would fund women's centres if elected. Once  in, the NDP set up the Ministry of Women's  Equality.  Then in April, 1992, the ministry gave  annual core funding to 28 BC women's centres and to BC&Y itself—$37,500 each, to be  exact. It was a key victory for the women's  movement in BC [see Kinesis, Apr. 92].  In order to qualify for operational funding from the ministry, women's groups had  to meet certain criteria: a group must be nonprofit, community based, primarily serving  women, registered under the BC Societies  Act and, most importantly, be a member of  BC&Y.  Rather than the government attempt a  definition of women's centres, they chose to  define a "women's centre" through membership in BC&Y. As BC&Y presented itself  as an association of feminist, equality seeking groups, it would automatically deter  groups such as REAL women and other anti-  choice, anti-feminist groups from joining  the association and thereby, being eligible  for funding.  The other criteria set by the government  was intended to allow the NDP some exceptions—not every BC&Y member group was  guaranteed core funding.  But the criteria meant that the government was not going to give core operational  funding to groups that were not members of  BC&Y, such as the South Asian Women's  Action Network (SAWAN), the Philippine  Women's Centre, and the Vancouver Lesbian Connection (VLC).  "So, in the beginning, the agenda was  not to make funding for centres inclusive.  The government is funding women's centres on the criteria of being feminist and part  of BC&Y. But BC&Y is primarily about white  women. There is little involvementof women  of colour, and Aboriginal women. This had  to be addressed," says BC&Y staff member  Theresa Tait.  Sam Simpson of Nelson Women's Centre points out that "while the ministry could  have used membership in the BC&Y as a  consideration, [putting] it down as a necessary condition was a real mistake."  Making BC&Y the agency that groups  had to join in order to get funding, essentially "forced us to live up to one of the  purposes of the society—that we would do  everything we could to secure core funding  for women's centres," says Hara.  "But on the other hand," she adds, "if  we left it to the government to decide, we  may have them supporting people we don't  want them to support."  At the BC&Y ACM last year, member  groups met with Ministerof Women's Equality Penny Priddy. The ministry recognized  that BC&Y was a loose network of women's  centres, but suggested that the organization  get back to her in a year with its decision  about the nature of the relationship BC&Y  would want to have with the ministry. She  suggested BC&Y might want to look in to  having a larger role and morecontrol around  the funding of BC's women's centres.  "Have you heard the feminist saying:  'Just give us the money?' Well, for some of  us in BC&Y who wanted to do the work of  improving communication, accountability,  and the membership criteria of BC&Y, and  working towards a stronger voice for women's centres, that's what this was saying to  us," says Johnstone.  Meanwhile, the funding criteria put an  additional onus on BC&Y members to make  decisions about what a "women's centre"  should be and whose applications for funding BC&Y would support. At the BC&Y  AGM last year, members drafted out a broad  definition of what a "women's centre" is in  order to come up with criteria that was  encompassing enough to allow new groups,  who were in the process of being established  or had not been established long, to join the  organization.  By October, 1992, ten new groups had  joined BC&Y in order to secure funding.  They included SAWAN, the VLC, the  Phillipine Women's Centre the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective, Ucleulet Women's Centre, Grand Forks Women's Centre,  and Surrey Women for Action.  However, when BC&Y drafted up the  definition of a "women's centre," one word  had never been defined: "feminism."  "We needed to understand amongst  ourselves what our principles for operating  our centres are and embodied in those principles are things like anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-classism," says Chris Rahim of  the Vancouver Status of Women (VSW).  So in February, the Coordinating Collective of the BC&Y decided to use their core  funding to hire a full-time staff person,  Theresa Tait, to provide support to the volunteer structure of the association. At the  same time, BC&Y also hired a part-time  trainingstrategy coordinator, Manisha Singh,  to set up a training strategy project to help  women identify the feminist principles and  practises of the association and develop a  three:year training based upon that.  The project was aimed at helping member groups "define ourselves, before we are  further defined by the bureaucracy which  funds us." Meanwhile, BC&Y requested a  meeting with Minister of Women's Equality  Penny Priddy in April, after the provincial  budget came down. BC&Y reminded Priddy  that the association now had new members  and expected the province to provide more  money for all member groups.  "The answer we were given was that  there is some new money but not enough for  allcentres," says Johns tone. "They then asked  us if we would like to take part in ma king the  funding decisions."  The steering committee sent a report to  member groups, outlining the ministry's  position and proposing a number of options  for action around funding for women's centres to discuss at the AGM. "One of the ones  was the money goes into a pot and gets  divided evenly, another was that we send  the money back and say if you can't fund all  of us, none of us want the money, and there  were other ideas," says Pat Cooke, the Secretary of BC&Y from Chetwynd.  "We were all of the opinion that everyone should be funded—the new centres and  the old ones, the lesbian ones, and women of  colour ones," says Louise Hudson of Richmond Women's Centre.  Johnstone says there was an expectation that, when the Priddy came to the AGM  to give a luncheon speech, "we would have  an answer [as to the role we wanted to  play]."  But when the BC&Y representatives got  together for the AGM in May to plan the  agenda for the coming year, it took all of the  first morning just to come up a mission  statement inclusive of women of colour,  Aboriginal women and lesbians, among  other oppressed groups.  Rahim says "it became quite clear then  that there were some serious political differences between women's centres."  The mission statement read: "The B.C.  and Yukon Association of Women's Centres  is a feminist collective actively working as  allies to end the oppression of all women  through the empowerment of women's centres."  "But when it came to practice, to working on issues, it was apparent that these were  new concepts that they didn't know how to  deal with," says Tait. "I had understood the  representatives would come to the meeting  to work toward building alliances. I was  surprised at how much work they individually needed to do."  Morrison says that "The shit hit the fan"  when the questions of funding and racism  came up, says Morrison. "There was a need  to address these questions before anything  else. It was unfortunate that we got bogged  down in it.  "It came down to the question of some  of the women's centres, who represent  women of privilege—generally white,  straight, middle-class women—appearing  to be more interested in preserving their  peice of the pie as opposed to fighting for the  larger principled issues."  For some women at the AGM, the developments came as something of a surprise. Pat Cooke, the secretary of BC&Y  from Chetwynd, says she had "never even  stopped to think that we were mostly white  Singh says she too was surprised, but at  the lack of awareness around issues at the  AGM "because these issues have been on the  table for a long time in the feminist movement. I thought women's centres were further along than this. But I found there isn't  really a commitment to change and deal  with issues of racism and other isms."  Tait says that, if the women in BC&Y  decide they want to build alliances, "they  have to do their own work in order for us to  work together. If the mission statement says  BC&Y is based on alliances, women's centres need to figure out for themselves how to  build alliances with people of colour and  Aboriginal people. We in the Aboriginal  communities can't do their work for them."  Women eventually broke into small  groups to discuss the four options placed  before them, but no consensus was reached.  "The centres couldn't make a decision  like whether to return the funding or take a  smaller slice without going back to their  centres. I guess, the understanding of the  coordinating collective was that they would  come with that knowledge in hand," says  Cooke.  Many of the women at the AGM said  they hadn't received or read the material  that was sent to them.  Says Hudson: "That's a problem every  year when the AGM happens. There's always new women that come to it, so there's  no consistancy, no continuity. But it is still  the responsibility of the women's centres to  read the minutes..."  "The issue of funding essentially became a catalyst for a much larger debate  regarding the purposes of BC&Y," says  Johnstone. "It's about deciding what the  organization wants to do. We weren't able to  discuss thatatthe AGM. But we'll have to, in  older to move forward."  Reid sees the issue as being less about  the new member centres, than about existing  member centres that have been in BC&Y  since its conception. "[They] may not agree  with the bylaws and constitutions. But now  their funding is tied to their retaining membership. Some would probably rather be  members of BC&Y in order to network with  other centres once a year."  So while the steering committee was  hoping for a willingness on the part of member organizations to take a group risk when  Priddy attended the AGM this year, "women  basically said, 'we need more money'," says  Rahim. "Well, Priddy's been hearing that all  along from us and has told us how much we  can expect. The question is who's going to  get more money and who's going to decide  that?  "BC&Y was set up—and maybe this is  where the fundamental problem lies—to assist in the establishment of new women  centres. And everybody must own that purpose, and that is work."  So while some groups prefer to think of  BC&Y as a loose association, others have a  different commitment to the purposes of the  association.  "The association can continue to exist  with its status quo. But then it will continue  to fail in upholding the mission statemnet  and the constitution, to work towards alliances," says Tait.  As Kinesis goes to press, an announcement is expected from the province regarding the status of funding for women's groups  in the province. Meanwhile, some coordinating collective members have sent out a  questionnaire to BC&Y member groups to  see where member groups stand. BC&Y is  required to hold its AGM by December,  under funding criteria set by the government.  Fatima Jaffer and Juline Macdonnell spent  hours on this story.  JULY/AUGUST 1993 News  BC teachers strike:  After back  to work  by Wendy Frost  BC's NDP government backed up its  economic restraint policy in May with another right-wing tactic: back-to-work legislation.  The provincial government legislated  striking Vancouver teachers back to work in  May, ending their three-week strike.  The major issues in the strike were class  size and maintaining levels of service for  ESL (English as a Second Language) students and special needs students who have  been integrated into regular classrooms.  Bill 31, the Educational Programs Continuation Act, was passed into law without  amendment in an emergency sitting of the  legislatureonSunday,May30.Thebill forced  teachers back to work the next day, and sent  their dispute to binding arbitration. In this  process, a government-appointed arbitrator  hears final positions from both sides, and  then imposes a contract settlement.  The BC Teachers' Federation strongly  opposed the government's intervention in  free collective bargaining. Christina Schut of  the BCFT notes that there are 15 locals still  bargaining throughout the province. The  threat of this legislation being used can only  have a negative effect on their negotiations,  she says.  On June 15, the Vancouver and District  Labour Council (VDLC) passed a motion  condemning the provincial government's  action in passing Bill 31, and urging the  government to refrain from invoking it in  any further disputes.  At the VDLC meeting, Al Blakeney of  the Vancouver Teachers' Federation (VTF),  pointed out the irony of the NDP's move. He  noted that it was the Socreds who granted  teachers the right to strike, and it's now the  NDP, who have historically opposed government intervention in collective bargaining, who have legislated them back to work.  Other public sector delegates at the  VDLC meeting voiced fears that Bill 31 will  set a precedent for intervention in public  sector bargaining.  The emergency law provides Labour  Minister Moe Sihota with special powers to  intervene in any other teacher work stoppages in the province. This means the new  law can be applied to any other school district where negotiations are seen to have  broken down. Sihota can then give the two  sides 36 hours to reach an agreement, after  which he could appoint a special mediator  with the power to impose a contract.  As we go to press, teachers in Surrey,  who were ordered back to work under this  legislation, are waiting to hear the terms of  the contract that will be imposed on them by  their special mediator.  Meanwhile, teachers say they are dismayed at the government's intervention.  "The loss of free collective bargaining rights  is a big concern," says Margaret McMaster  of Vancouver Elementary School Teachers'  Association (VESTA).  The government argues that the intervention was necessary because the welfare  of students was at stake, that collective bargaining had failed in the Vancouver school  district, and that they had no choice but to  intervene.  "This legislation is designed to support  collective bargaining where it works, and fix  it where it doesn't work," says Labour Minister Sihota.  But the teachers don't see it as a no-  choice situation. Rather, McMaster maintains, the NDP's fiscal policies played into  the hands of school boards both in Vancouver and in the rest of the province.  "The huge emphasis this government  has put on holding the line on spending gave  a lot of school boards the excuse to say that  budgets were the problem," says McMaster.  "There was lots of permission for the Boards  to plead inability to pay."  What the government intervention  comes down to, says McMaster, is that "the  provincial government has really let us down  in terms of promises they made about restoring stability to education and making a thorough assessment of needs in the big urban  districts."  In Vancouver, those needs include ESL  services, and services for special needs students and for inner city schools.  Jo Elliott, a member of the negotiating  team for the VTF, says the teachers' demands focused on protection for "non-enrolling" teachers in the collective agreement,  thereby giving some guarantee of mainte  nance of levels of service. Non-enrolling  teachers include librarians, teacher/counsellors, teacher/psychologists, Language  Assistance teachers, ESL teachers, and speech  language pathologists.  The VTF sought protection in the collective agreement for ratios of non-enrolling  teachers to classroom teachers. Without  such protection, non-enrolling teachers and  the services they provide have usually been  the first to go under budget cuts.  In the changes to the BC education system under Curriculum 2000, special needs  and ESL students are integrated into regular  classrooms. While many, including the BC  Teachers' Federation (BCTF), supports integration, also known as mainstreaming, the  VTF's Elliott stresses that mainstreaming  requires facilities, resources, and personnel  to work successfully.  According to McMaster, "Half of Vancouver's students arrive in the system not  functional in the language of instruction."  Fifty per cent of students in the Vancouver-  school system have English as a second language.  Raminder Dosanjh of the India Mahila  Association agrees. "For immigrant students in regular schools, ESL services are  crucial. Unless they have remedial help to  enable them to acquire that language base in  English, they won't have equal access to full  participation in education."  Yet throughout the bargaining, the Vancouver School Board has maintained that  there is little funding available for increases  in spending on these services.  In early May, after offering no guarantees of necessary service levels for students,  the Vancouver School Board had walked  away from the bargaining table. In a last-  ditch effort to bring the Board back to bargaining and avoid job action, the VTF held a  week of rotating strikes. When this attempt  failed, Vancouver teachers were forced into  a full scale strike. A special mediator, ap-  Cfas^^^&M&irVij  pointed by the Labour Relations Board, was  unable to convince the Board to move from  its position.  Elliott blames the deadlock in bargaining on both the provincial government and  on the VSB. She feels the government intervened far too early: "We hadn't even withdrawn our services when the government  began to talk about special mediation. They  made it easy for the Board not to negotiate  with us."  McMaster points out that the VSB proposed a three-year contract, making statements about their ability to pay in three  year's time, even though they have no information at this point about what their budgets will be then.  Vancouver teachers say they are hoping  for a better deal from binding arbitration  than the VSB has been willing to offer so far.  However, some teachers fear that the  Board's ref usa I to budge in negotia tions con -  ceals a hidden agenda to move toward province-wide bargaining. The BCTF supports  direct bargaining on a district-by-district  basis, and opposes province-wide bargaining because of lack of local accountability  and because of the differences in needs between large and small, or urban and rural  districts.  Elliott says that the many job actions  across the province this spring may be just  the excuse the provincial government needs  to claim that local bargaining is not working.  Elliott points out that local collective  agreements are worked out to support special programs, structures and demands in  their own districts. The particular needs of a  diverse urban district like Vancouver, especially the needs of ESL students and inner  city children, might end up overlooked under provincial bargaining.  "The farther away from the school districts decisions are made, the greater the  likelihood that the decisions will not be made  based on the needs of children," says a BCTF  report on local bargaining.  Chrstina Schut says the real change the  provincial government needs to make in  BC's education system is not altering the  bargaining structure,but providing adaquate  funding. "BC's education system is  going through enormous changes, like  mainstrea ming and integra tion, and responding to the needs of an increasingly diverse  student population," says Schut. "Transitions cost more money, not less, but we're  seeing these major changes take place in the  midst of financial restraint."  Meanwhile,  teachers in Vancouver  awaiting the arbitrator's report are hoping  that Vancouver school children will not be  the ones paying the price for the province's  school boards refusal to prioritise spending  for services and the provincial government's  latest refusal to take a political stand.

JULY/AUGUST 1993 News  Women workers fight back:  Justice for janitors  by Yee Jim  For about $35 a night, non-union janitors clean the equivalent of 12 single-family  homes. Non-union janitors represent half of  the downtown janitorial workforce. The  majority are women and come from immigrant and of colour communities.  In Vancouver, at a march and rally for  justice for janitors on June 15, the Justice for  Janitors OrganizingCommitteenamed Marathon Realty a 1993 Enemy of Justice and  winner of the "Top Trash Award."  Marathon Realty, Canadian Pacific's  huge multi-national real estate arm, was  chosen because janitors who work for their  cleaning contractor, New York-based Ogden  Allied Services Inc., have no union representation and are subjected to unsafe working  conditions, paid poverty-level wages, and  denied health and pension benefits. Workers at Ogden Allied are currently on a drive  to unionize with the help of the Service  Employees International Union.  Raminder Dosanjh of the India Mahila  Association says "it is easier for employers  to exploit [janitors]" because they, like farm  workers, home workers, and domestic workers, tend to be mostly women of colour and  in jobs where employment standards don't  apply in the same way as for other jobs.  Dosanjh points out that many immigrants, who are new to the country, don't  understand English well and are not fully  aware of their rights. "Many are forced to  hold on to the jobs they can get. Many are  trying to adjust to a new country and are  trying to make ends meet. And it's not easy  to be organizing yourself [with all that going  on]."  She adds that, while various other  groups lobby for employment equity, training, and credential recognition the exploitation of janitorial workers has yet to be taken  upas,  issue. "We need to take a hard  ok at the exploitation. If we want equality,  we need equality across the board," says  Dosanjh.  A number of the employees at Ogden  Allied have reported violations of labour  and health and safety regulations. Ogden  em ployees report tha t they often work seven  and a half hours without any breaks; they  are not properly informed about the hazards  of cleaning chemicals; they are not provided  withadequate safety equipment; they donot  have access to first aid kits or a first aid  attendant; and they are not allowed to bring  food into the building for "security" reasons.  Because of this rule, one person took a  container of juice from the cafeteria on the  premises to drink. A video camera recorded  the incident, and the worker was fired for  "theft." In another incident, a person's eyes  were accidentally flushed with chemicals  and he was denied help for four hours because he was not allowed out of the building. Similar conditions have been reported  in a number of other non-union companies.  "The company [Marathon] holds the  money. They have a big responsibility in  this," says Myra Reyes, an organizer of Justice for Janitors.  In a statement released to the public, the  company states: "Marathon Realty has no  direct knowledge of the causes or nature of  any dispute between our janitorial contractors at Waterfront Centre and that company's employees, or between those employees and the Service Employees Interna-  tional Union." Marathon directs further questions to Ogden and their employees, the union or the Labour Relations Board.  "We have tried to talk with them but  they have refused," says Paul Singh Gill,  another organizer for Justice for Janitors.  "The bottom line is, Marathon pays Ogden  Allied and they can force Ogden Allied to  pay better wages."  Sarbjit Basi, who works for Ogden at  Marathon Realty's Waterfront Centre, is re  sponsible for cleaning two large floors there.  Basi's workload includes collecting and  transporting all the garbage; cleaning washrooms, which includes toilets and sinks, and  restocking sanitary pads; cleaning the doors,  walls, microwaves, and refrigerator; dusting; recycling; sweeping; and vacuuming.  There is much meticulous detail involved. She often doesn't have time to complete the required work. Supervisors have  told her that the company gets paid to do the  recycling, microwaves and refrigerator, but  she doesn't get paid for it. She has to do it  any way. In addition, she says that the workload for women is greater than for the men.  The men at her work-site are only responsible for mopping and throwing away the  trash that has been collected. Basi still hasn't  been given the raise she was promised after  her probation period ended—she still nets  $800 a month.  The risks of speaking up are high, but  Basi says, "lam standing up for what I know  is right. We have to speak up!"  She is currently the only wage earner  supporting her infant daughter, and her  husband. "I can take care of my baby in the  day while my husband is looking for  work...but I can't afford to leave [my  job]," Basi says. "I don't want to take  [this  treatment]  anymore."  When Ogden found out that workers  were talking with the union, the company  began to report a large number of complaints, and on-site company checks escalated. The company has gone as far as at-  temptingto undermine theefforts of janitorial  workers to unionize by asking them to sign  letters alleging that the union has intimidated them.  Basi said that many of them didn't  know what they were signing. They thought  they were signing a list of demands to the  company. According to Reyes, some workers were told not to return to work the next  day if they didn't sign the letter.  Jim Storie of Ogden Allied says that he  can't comment very much on labour relations because "further charges are pending." The Labour Relations Board is  currently hearing unfair labour practice  charges.  Reyes is confident that they will exceed  the required 55 per cent support by Ogden  employees for unionization. According to  Reyes, unionization will happen, "it's just a  matter of weeks."  When asked what she considered to be  "justice for janitors," Reyes responded: "Fair  wages. There is big development [taking  place] in the city and people say there is  prosperity, but what is there for the janitors?  Nobody thinks about who is cleaning the  office building at night. Justice includes fair  wages, good working conditions, and a share  of the wealth."  Yee Jim is a first time Kinesis writer,  who's proud of her dad who zvorks as a  janitor.  Miss Saigon misses:  Not a love story  by Agnes Huang   Protesters rallied in front of the Princess  of Wales Theatre in Toronto on May 26, the  opening night of the musical Miss Saigon.  About 120 people greeted performance goers  with flyers protesting the sexist and racist  representations in the production.  "Miss Saigon is the latest in a long string  of artistic productions written by white people about people of colour that totally distorts our lives and twists our realities into a  white, romanticized vision of the world,"  says Lisa Valencia-Svensson, a member of  Asian ReVisions: Beyond Miss Saigon, which  organized the protest. The musical was written in 1987 by two French men.  Asian ReVisions is a broad-based organization of Asian activists, community  workers and artists, the majority of whom  are women. Many other community groups  supported the protest action, including:  Korean Women's Collective, Asian Lesbians  of Toronto, Coalition to Stop Showboat, Lesbian Youth Peer Support, Jewish Feminist  Anti-FascisxLeague, DIVA: South Asian Women's Quarterly, NAC, and the Chinese Canadian National Council (Toronto Chapter).  Miss Saigon is the story of Kim, a 17 year  old Vietnamese woman, who is bought one  night in a brothel by an American soldier for  Anti-Miss Saigon demonstrators in Toronto  his friend, Chris. Kim and Chris "fall in  love," but soon after Chris is evacuated from  Vietnam. He goes home and gets married  thinking Kim is dead. Meanwhile, Kim has  had his child, and believes Chris will come  back and "save" her child from the destitution of Asia. When Chris learns Kim is alive,  he returns to Vietnam with his new wife.  Kim thinks Chris will take their child to  America, buthehasnointentionof doing so.  Kim prepares their child for his journey and  then kills herself.  "The production sends an insulting  message in terms of the realities of 'Eurasians'—that the only place Eurasians should  be or would want to be is in a white, western  ized world, and that Asian women are not as  capable of providing for us as white families  are," says Valencia-Svensson, whose mother  is Filipina and father Swedish-American.  Miss Saigon is a mega-production, costing $12 million to put on, and expected to  gross $60 million. Spearheaded by Toronto  entrepreneur David Mirvish, Miss Saigon is  being sponsored by American Express and  Canadian Airlines.  The show has played in London, New  York,and Tokyo. In New York, Asian Americans launched a similar protest action, targeting the decision to hire a white man to  play the role of an Eurasian man, as well as  the sexist and racist content of the show.  The protest action was basically dismissed by the mainstream media. In the  Toronto Star, the protest action in Toronto  received just one line of a full page, pull-out  feature on the production.  While Asian ReVisions is currently focusing its efforts around Miss Saigon, they  _ see the issues as being broader. "Miss Saigon  is but one example of the pervasive stereotyping of people of colour in mainstream  ' culture," says Valencia-Svensson.  Asian ReVisions has also joined the  Coalition to Stop Shozvboat to protest that  production. Shoivboat, based on a novel written in the 1920s, is set in the southern US. The  story revolves around lives of white people,  with Black people playing only side roles as  servants and helpers. The Coalition is protesting the show, saying it "romanticizes an  era which was cruel and dehumanizing to  Black people." The production is expected to  open in October and is being funded by  public money.  Asian ReVisions is continuing its public  education and awareness raising efforts  around Miss Saigon. The group plans to hold  similar protests and leafleting actions on a  regular basis.

Women Fighting  Housing Harassment  The Tenants' Rights Action Coalition  (TRAC) and the YWCA Vancouver Housing  Registry are lobbying the NDP government  to make changes to the Residential Tenancy  Act (RTA) which will enable women to protect themselves from harassing landlords.  Under the current legislation, women  who are harassed by male landlords have no  legal way to fight back. The kinds of harassment that women report range from illegal  entry and verbal abuse to sexual assault.  Male landlords and caretakers often ask  women very personal questions and monitor the comings and goings of guests. Lesbians are often harassed about their women  guests. These and other kinds of invasions of  women's rights to privacy and safety are too  common.  TRAC is working with YWCA Vancouver Housing Registry to effect a change in  the RTA as well as to develop an effective  enforcement procedure to enable tenants to  take a harassing landlord to arbitration.  To help in this process, women who  have experienced harassment by their landlord are urged to contact Chris McDowell at  the Housing Registry at 873-1313 or Roneen  Marcoux at TRAC at 255-3099.

JULY/AUGUST 1993 News  National Action Committee's AGM and Voter's Guide;  NAC gets rolling  by Erin Mullan  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women looked back at a year with  major successes, and forward to new challenges when it held its annual general meeting in June.  Under the theme "taking our places,  feminism in the 90s," 500 delegates met in  Saskatoon from June 4-6 for the annual NAC  conference. For many BC delegates the highlight of the conference was the unanimous  acclamation of new NAC president Sunera  Thobani.  BC delegate from Women Against Violence Against Women, Zara Suleman, says  that there was tension in the air at the AGM  The tension broke when  all of the members  followed out-going  president Judy Rebick's  suggestion of a show of  solid support for  Thobani by  unanimously endorsing  the acclamation of the  new president.  because of the racist backlash that came after  the appointment of the first woman of colour as NAC president. The tension broke  when all of the members followed out-going  president Judy Rebick's suggestion of a show  of solid support forThobani by unanimously  endorsing the acclamation of the new president.  The change of president comes at the  end of a year of change and growth for NAC.  Delegates looked back at the major issues of  the past year such as the implications of new  reproductive technologies, the struggle to  end male violence, the campaign against the  North American Free Trade Agreement, and  especially NAC's stance on the referendum  on the Charlottetown accord.  New NAC executive board member-at-  large Miche Hill says that NAC's'NO'campaign gave the organization such a high  profile in the popular media that NAC became a household word. She says that the  networking that happened with Native women's groups was an important step forward.  "The 'NO' campaign shows the kind of  clout we can have when we all work together," says Hill. "I think it was a really  good demonstration of how grassroots women's groups can work within a national organization like NAC and put on a campaign  that really can make a difference. It was a  show of power and we should be proud of  the result."  NAC is changing its structure in order  to give more power to the regions and to the  grassroots. The BC plans to apply to the  national office for funding for three regional  confereneces over the next year.  Suleman says that by defusing the  powerbase in Ottawa and Toronto NAC can  wage campaigns that are nationally linked  but locally based and direct action oriented,  rather than just on-paper campaigns.  She says she thinks NAC wil be facing a  racist and anti-feminist backlash, and that  the organization will need to do more than  just support its new president. She says  NAC will need to take a strong anti-racist  stand, and to network regionally with Aboriginal and women of colour groups.  One of the most complex issues addressed at the conference was new reproductive technologies. There were two main  approaches to NRTs such as prenatal testing  and genetic screening. One position is based  on the absolute right of an individual woman  to choose, while the other puts the question  of what real choices are available to the vast  majority of women given the broader economic and social framework.  A compromise was reached on NAC's  NRT position. The conference agreed that  their goal is to see a halt of the momentum  towards routine genetic screening in prenatal care.  However, the organization did not endorse a motion proposing eligibility requirements for screening. Some abortion rights  advocates felt restricting prenatal screening  to high-risk pregnancies could be an infringement on women's choice.  N AC regiona 1 rep Jackie La rkin says the  compromise is a temporary solution but  doesn't resolve the fundamental issue.  "I think the debate is not a simple one  and a lot more discussion has to happen,"  says Larkin. With the Royal Commission on  N RTs report d ue next month, the deba te wi 11  continue in the months to come.  A major new development of this AGM  was the establishment of a youth caucus.  Catherine Snowden of the Simon Fraser  University Women's Centre says the youth  caucus set up a Canadian Women's Youth  "We have one basic  agenda that's the  same—defeat the Tory  agenda," says [Miche]  Hill. "That ought to be  fun in itself. Satisfaction  guaranteed."  Network (CANWYN) and there are now  two youth reps on the NAC executive.  "We hope to get a youth agenda ready  for the next AGM, which could piggyback  the NAC agenda with a youth perspective,"  says Snowdon.  She added that input from young women  could prevent oversights like education not  being included in the NAC voters guide to  the next election.  NAC plans to mount a major campaign  to push women's issuesduring the upcoming  federal election. Miche Hill says NAC will  be building on the coalitions that developed  during the referendum campaign and the  fight against NAFTA to combat the corporate agenda in the election.  "We have one basic agenda that's the  same—defeat the Tory agenda," says Hill.  "That ought to be fun in itself. Satisfaction  guaranteed."  Erin Mullan is a Vancouver freelance  writer who dreams of cycling in Neivfound-  land.  by Faith Jones  As part of its political action around the upcoming federal elections—expected to be  called for September or October—the National Action Committee on the Status of Women  has published The NAC Voter's Guide.  Co-written by Huguette Leger and Judy Rebick, the book attempts to help Canadian  women analyse political candidates and parties on the basis of their records to date and  policies on issues of concern to women.  Issues include child care, poverty, violence against women, free trade, unpaid labour,  health, social programs, unemployment, training and human rights. There is also a section  giving summaries of some of legislation introduced over the past five years. Another section  has a blank "report card" which can be filled out to rate your local candidate on where she  stands on issues relevant to women. The section suggests ways of sharing this report card  with women in your area.  The Voter's Guide's  main strengths,  perhaps, are its broad  understanding of what  the issues of concern to  women are, and the  accessible style of the  writing.

The questions on all issues are then summarized in a separate section at the end  of the book.  Both the writing style and the layout follow plain language principles. Key information  is pulled out in bold type, making it easy to browse for the areas which interest or concern  us. These bold-face statements (or callouts) also help give context to the issues discussed in  the text. For example, the section on violence against women has a callout which reads:  "More than half of assaults reported to police by women are committed by spouses or former  spouses."  However, the parts of the text in small type (case studies and summaries of the parties'  positions on issues) may be too small for women with vision impairment to read comfortably, while the rest of the text is in larger, more accessible type.  The tables of statistical information are also not very accessible. The information is  confusing and presented using the bureaucratic language of the organizations who collected  the information (usually Statistics Canada). For example, a table entitled "Labour Force  Participation Rate for Women with Childrenat Home, by Marital Status"—itself confusing—  begins with the category "total marital status." What is a total marital status? (What they  mean is that those figures are the total rate of paid employment for women with children at  home).  The text makes much better use of the statistical information, and also points out the gaps  in information that we have about women in this country. For example, Statistics Canada  notes that, on average, women who have never been married earn more than women who  are or were married. Leger and Rebick note that we don't have any information on why that's  the case—another nice touch: when they don't know, they say so and offer a guess.  While the book deals with almost twenty issues fairly comprehensively, there are a few  gaps. Missing issues include biggies like the education system (for children or post-  secondary). And in some cases, the concerns of some women are not always articulated: for  example, lesbian concerns aren't generally integrated into areas that aren't specific to them;  women of colour tend to be lumped in with other women and issues specific to them aren't  identified as such. For example, the section on domestic workers does not mention that most  domestic workers are women of colour, or the role that racism plays in their current legal and  economic status. Therefore, that section is not indexed under either "women of colour" or  "racism."  Despite the flaws, this guide is generally useful and accessible, and could serve as a  starting point for a continuing process of women's self-education during elections and other  campaigns.

JULY/AUGUST 1993 What's News  by Anjula Gogia  A litany  for survival  The 8th annual conference for empowering women of colour took place in May at  the University of California, Berkeley. The  empowering women of colour conferences  began in 1985 in the US and through the  years, have become a place for women of  colour to meet and strategize in a safe space.  Called A Litany for Survival...In Memory  of Audre Lorde and All Our Foremothers, the  conference drew approximately 250 people,  mostly from various colleges and universities in California. Many of the participants  were women of colour, with a few white  women and men in attendance.  The day-long conference opened with a  powerful address by Cherrie Moraga, a  Chicana lesbian writer and co-editor of This  Bridge Called My Back. Moraga spoke of her  friendship with Audre Lorde, and of how  women of colour relate with each other. She  described her own process of claiming her  Chicana identity.  Moraga was followed by a plenary  panel. It featured Dorothy Tsuruta, a writer  and currently chair of the Ethnic Studies  Department at Mills College; Celine Salazar  Parrenas, a "Pilpina Peminist Pilmmaker,"  who spoke of her experiences as a collective  member of Small This, a women of colour  journal; Pat Riley, a Native American writer  and graduate student; and Ruth Foreman,  an African-American writer, who closed the  plenary with a selection of her poetry.  In the afternoon, we had a choice of 11  workshops, which were repeated in two  sessions, so women could attend more than  one. Workshops that were for women of  colour only included: Women of Colour in  Academia; a participatory workshop on  poetry; How to Get Your Work Published;  Coalition Building Among Women of Colour Activists; Issues of Mothering for Lesbian and Bisexual Women of Colour; Sexual  Harassment; Forging Global Connections;  Health Issues; The Role of Art; and Women  of Colour Youth as Activists. Two workshops were offered for white women and  men: Unlearning Racism, Sexism and  Heterosexism; and Building Coalitions with  Women of Colour.  The conference ended with a plenary  session facilitated by Melinda Micco, one of  the conference organizers. Barbara Christian, the first woman of colour professor to  gain tenure at UC Berkeley, gave the closing  address. She encouraged participants to offer feedback on the conference.  Criticisms included: the lack of a space  for coalition building among lesbian and  heterosexual women of colour; and the rigidity of the agenda, which didn't leave  room for much socializing and informal  networking with other women of colour.  Conference organizers say that plans  are under way for the 10th annual confer-  ence in 1995 to be international.   Anjula Gogia bumped into this conference  during a trip to San Francisco.  by Shannon e. Ash and Wendy  Frost  Women slam Safer  City Task Force  When a number of women's and other  community groups made presentations to  Vancouver City Council in response to the  recently released Vancouver Safer City Task  Force's final report, they caused a bit of a sti r.  But when the council meeting, held in  earlyjune,adjourned later thatnight, mayor  Gordon Campbell and most councillors accepted the recommendations of the report  despite the major criticisms from the community.  The Vancouver Safer City Task Force  was created in October 1991. It included  members of the public appointed by Mayor  Gordon Campbell, and members of City  Council, School Board, Park Board and The  Vancouver Police. Its terms of reference  were to "recommend actions and strategies  that Council may undertake to make Vancouver a safer place for all of us."  But according to some, the Vancouver  Status of Women (VSW) included, the report  completely failed to do so.  In a presentation written by Miche Hill,  Jennifer Johnstone and Johannah Pilot, VSW  criticizes the report on several counts:  That the majority of the recommendations are "band-aid solutions," such as safety  audits and leaving porch lights on, which  aim at reducing levels of fear, rather than  addressing the real threats to women's safety.  The report "does not acknowledge or deal  with the violence women are subject to in  their own homes."  That the report obscures the fact that  women are unsafe because of women's inequality in society. The report uses the gender-neutral term "domestic violence", for  example, rather than referring to violence  against women and children. It also states  that "women probably abuse as often as  men and for the same reasons," a position it  fails to substantiate.  That the language and tone of the report is racist. The use of the term "ethnic  community" throughout the report refers  only to people of colour. The section on  "racial issues" is the only section in the  report that uses terms such as "alleged",  "suggested", and "perceived" to describe  incidents of violence, racism and racist harassment. "According to this report, threats  to the safety of people of colour are not real.  Racism has not been taken seriously by this  Task Force."  Johnstone of VSW says, "[The Task  Force] didn't approach the issue of safety in  terms of real violence for women, and women  of colour and First Nations women in particular, but in terms of violence as a perception of fear on the part of women.. .The terms  of reference are way too broad."  For example, traffic safety is given as  much weight as "domestic violence," or violence against women and children.  In her presentation, councillor Libby  Davies said she agreed with VSW's critique,  pointing out that the Council had not defined well enough what they were looking  for at the outset, that the Task Force then  went beyond what was wanted and, as a  result, the report wasn't focused enough.  This is not the first time the Task Force  has heard these criticisms. In May, 1992,  VSW sent a letter to the Task Force expressing concern that the Task Force was not  focusing on women's safety issues in the  context of the realities of women's lives.  VSW believes the voices and experiences of  women working in front line organizations  in the city were not listened to by the Task  Force, despite the fact that many Vancouver  women's groups made submissions.  Nancy Morrison, chair of the 14-mem-  ber Task Force, while "applauding" VSW  for their "vigilance," defends the report in an  interview with the Vancouver Sun: "Focusing on violence just against women and  children would have been to diminish the  concerns of all the other people suffering  abuse in society."  Morrison also objects to Hill's use of the  word "racist," saying that Hill is only seeing  things from "her own perspective." (Hill is a  First Nations woman).  VSW concluded that the $104,000 report  is shaped by a "predetermined law and order agenda" focusing on "an increase in  policing and increased protection of prop  erty" and that the Task Force was a "waste of  time, energy and resources."  The women's organization was far from  the only critic of the report. In a presentation  at Council, one dissenter, a journalist with  Roger's Cable TV, maintained that the report is "vague, simplistic, wrong, makes  assumptions and then refuses to back them  up, advocates a totalitarian state, and finally,  is redundant and prejudiced."  Jortn Moxin cited a number of measures  currently taken by the city that offer more  than the recommendations offered in the  report.  Moxin also pointed out the direct line  the Task Force draws from immigration and  consequent loneliness to illicit drug use and  turning to crime makes the report "a textbook argument for 'keeping out the foreigners.'" He notes that while Morrisson objected to this, she refused to say why.  "We are asked to take it on faith that the  committee meant well" and are not to be  held accountable for the report.  by Lissa Geller  Redefining  poverty  When poverty advocates and women's  grou ps heard that Brian Mulroney wa s planning to eliminate child poverty by the year  2000, perhaps only the most cynical believed  he might simply mean "redefine" poverty to  include fewer people. But he's made cynics  out of a lot more people now because that is  precisely what his government sub-committee on poverty has done.  The new House of Commons sub-committee report on poverty in Canada, chaired  by Tory backbencher Barbara Greene, has  told Canadians that we define our poverty  levels too high and if we just lowered the  levels, there would be 2 million less poor  people in Canada and poverty just wouldn't  be the problem we thought it was.  Poverty advocates and social policy  groups, who boycotted the hearings of the  committee because of the clear bias against  them, have reacted strongly to the report,  which was tabled despite a refusal to participate in the committee by Liberal or New  Democratic committee members.  The Canadian Council on Social Development is calling the report "part of the  process of blaming the victim." The Social  Planning Council of Metro-Toronto says the  report is "tragic." And the National Anti-  Poverty Organization (NAPO) calls it a backlash against what little progress had been  made in addressing high levels of poverty in  Canada.  MPs from the Liberal and New Democratic parties who withdrew from the subcommittee have refused to have their names  associated with the report. They have, instead, distributed a minority report which  lambasts Greene's.  Rosemarie Popham of the Child Poverty Action Group in Toronto points out the  government's blatant denial of the reality of  poor people in the report and says, "[The  Sub-committee] dismissed the research and  recommendations of organizations advocating for policies to improve the lives of the  18.3 per cent of our kids who are living in  poverty." Instead, the report deals almost  exclusively with the redefinition of "poor."  Among the more ludicrous recommendations in Greene's new definition is the recalculated allotment of $4 per day for food,  regardless of whether a person is male or  female, child, adolescent or adult, pregnant  or a nursing mother.

No allowances are made for day care costs for working parents, and the transportation allowance wouldn't even buy two monthly transit  passes in Vancouver, Toronto or a number  of other Canadian cities.  Although Greene claims that the first  step to eliminating poverty is to have a clear  definition of it, reports from other government departments show this debate to be  "academic" and of questionable merit. One  confidential memo leaked from the department of Health and Welfare notes that any  method of defining poverty is full of subjective and biased assumptions, "could result  in high or low poverty lines, [and] provides  little in terms of policy directions."  As Lynne Toupin of NAPO puts it, "the  government knows the perils of the Tory  committee's proposal... this ridiculous committee is sidetracking the whole issue."  BC upping  minimum wage  After years of lobbying for i  the minimum wage in BC, poverty advocates, workers' and women's groups have  succeeded in getting the government of British Columbia to raise the minimum wage in  the province for a second time this year to  $6.50 an hour by next fall. This would make  it the highest minimum wage in Canada.  Linda Marcotte of End Legislated Poverty says the raise is good news. "Another 50  cents an hour would be great." However,  she says the government still has to live up to  a promise they made to poverty groups to  raise the minimum wage to the poverty line  within the next four years.

Not surprisingly, the BC Chamber of  Commerce expressed shock that the government was forcing them to pay workers higher  wages. They predict the usual amount of  doom and gloom for small businesses but,  by their own admission, couldn't point to a  single business that had closed or suffered  because of the last increase of 50 cents earlier  this year.  All smoke  and mirrors  Taxpayers' dollars continue to be squandered by the Metro Toronto Police Department in an effort to shirk the blame for their  part in the rape of a woman in that city six  years ago.  According to WendyKomiotis,a teacher  with the Assaulted Women's and Children's  Counsellor and Advocacy Program, "The  delay and protracted handling of Jane Doe's  civil suit against the police for negligence in  the investigation of her rape—six years after  the fact—is appalling...[It] sends a clear message regarding the trivialization of violence  by men against women."  Jane Doe (whose identity is being protected) launched the suit six years ago, following her rape and the conviction of the  rapist. She charges that, by failing to notify  her and other women in downtown Toronto  of the rapist's existence, the police had acted  negligently and violated her Charter rights.  Following the rape, Doe and a group of  women postered their neighbourhood with  information about the rapist. They also held  a public meeting to warn women against the  man they now knew to be a serial rapist.  Police did not send a representative to the  meeting.  Since then, police continue to refuse to  deal with Doe. Despite the admission of the  police chief in 1987 to two Toronto-area  newspapers that the department should have  issued a press release regarding the presence  of the Serial rapist in the downtown area,  police contend that Jane Doe has no legal  grounds to launch a civil suit against them.  Their defense says that Doe had "a responsibility to take all due care of [her] own safety."  Doe was asleep in bed with doors and windows locked on the night of the rape.  Police have dragged the proceedings  through court for six years, during which,  every one of the police's applications to stop  the case were denied by the courts. In this  recent ruling, the Supreme Court of Ontario  disagreed with the police's application that  they are not accountable. The court struck  down earlier appeals by the department to  stop the case from going ahead and, in 1991,  granted Doe the right to proceed to trial.  But Doe has yet to have her day in court.  The discovery process, (a pre-trial process in  which each side must disclose to the other  any information that is relevant to the  case),which began last month, could last for  several more years. A number of women's  groups rallied last month in Toronto to demand Doe's right to a speedy Discovery  process.  Women's groups, including the Toronto  RapeCrisisCentre(TRCC), which have been  supporting the case throughout, are calling  for the police force to be accountable to  women. "Information the police have about  crimes of rape and sexual assault in our  community can give women...power to control our lives [and] to protect ourselves,"  says Arm Willets of the TRCC.  Meanwhile the Women's Legal and  Education Fund (LEAF) have been assisting  Doe with her legal expenses. Since Doe still  faces a number of years of protracted legal  ba ttles, LEAF will ha ve tha t much less money  to spend on other cases in the interim.  And while the recent decision by the  Supreme Court means Jane Doe will finally  have the ability to force the department to  take responsibility for their inaction, women  aredemandinganswers to questionsof abuse  of power by the Metro Toronto Police Department.  "Why ha s it taken six years of Jane Doe's  life to bring the police to a stage of accountability where court proceedings can begin  on her behalf? Whose interests are being  served by police decisions to delay, deflect  and defer accountability for their actions?  Given that women are reporting rape crimes  in greater numbers, what are the police doing to change their practices to address the  issues of adequate police protection from  and investigation of sexual assault?" asks  community activist and advocate Elisabeth  Escobar.  Germany tightens  abortion law  Germany's upper house, the Bundesrat,  has struck a blow to women's reproductive  freedom by striking down hard won legislation that made abortion on demand legal, as  well as by requiring that women, regardless  of their economic circumstances, pay for the  cost of abortion themselves.  Women's groups in the country reacted  with anger at the Bundesrat's decision to  deny insurance coverage to women seeking  abortion and to allow abortions only when a  woman's health is threatened or when she  was raped.  "This is a catastrophe," said Regina  Hildebrandt, labour minister in the state of  Brandenburg. "This is just impossible in the  20th century. It means pregnancies can be  terminated, but only if you can pay."

The first round of the battle to defeat the  bill will take place in the Bundestag, where  the government is currently recasting the bill  to meet the demands of the upper house.  Conference on  women refugees  A recent conference entitled "Gender  Issues and Refugees," sponsored by the Centre for Refugee Studies in Toronto and the  York Centre for Feminist Research, pointed  out the glaring discrimination faced by  women refugees around the world. The conference was held at York University in May.  Theconference findings show that, while  the majority of the world's refugees are  women, the vast majority of refugees admitted to Canada are men.  "Three quarters of the world's refugees  are women and children," said Helene  Moussa, a conference organizer, "but the  system is designed for men." For example,  refugee claimants who are married are required to be heard together in one case, thus  discriminating against women by requiring  their claims to be heard in conjunction with  those of their husbands. Refugee lawyer  David Matas says women's cases should be  heard separately so their cases can be judged  on their own merit.  As well, recent changes to include persecution by sex as a ground for status only  apply to women already in Canada and not  to the large numbers of women applying for  status outside the country. Winona Giles of  the York University Women's Studies department points out that this means "women  can only claim refugee status under the new  guidelines if they can get to Canada. Surely  women in camps are among the most vulnerable of refugees" and they are not being  considered.  The three-day conference led into another conference by the Canadian Council  for Refugees, which spent an entire day on  issues of gender discrimination faced by  women refugees.  At the heart of the matter is the UN  definition of a refugee which was drawn up  in 1951 with men in mind. It allows for  people to be considered refugees if they fear  persecution because of their race, religion,  political opinion, nationality or membership in a particular social group. It does not  address gender discrimination issues like  rape by soldiers or interrogators, bride burning, violent husbands, genital mutilation or  forced marriage.  The conference made a number of concrete recommendations to end gender discrimination in refugee claims. Among them  are the inclusion of sex in the definition of a  refugee in the Canadian Immigration Act;  closely monitoring refugee boards to ensure  that existing gender discrimination guidelines are being applied; having the guidelines apply to women overseas; and working on the issue of women who are sponsored by their husbands and are then subjected to violence.  )ected to violence.  Let women know what  you're up to this fall  with a display ad or a  classifieds listing  Deadline August 18th  Call 255-5499  JULY/AUGUST 1993 Feature  Lesbians and gays in the Census:  Inclusion  debated  by Faith Jones  It's almost unprecedented: a government body approaching the lesbian and gay  community to talk about including us in its  work. That's what happened a few months  ago when a representative of Statistics  Canada (StatsCan) approached the December 9 Coalition to talk about possible inclusion in the 1996 census.  "I dined out on that story for a long  time," says barbara findlay, a lawyer who is  active in the December 9 Coalition, a group  of lesbians and gay men who address human rights issues. As a result of StatsCan's  request, the Coalition has decided to open  up the debate to lesbians and gays in Vancouver. They held several open meetings  last month to discuss the issues [see related  story J.  StatsCan's sudden interest in talking  with lesbians and gays began when they  noticed a variety of responses from lesbian  and gay couples who refused to lie in the last  census when answering the question on the  ...[it] would not result in  a count ot lesbians and  gays...just of lesbian  and gay couples.  relationship of people living together. Those  questionnaires were set aside for study, and  one potential result is that the next census  may have a category for lesbian and gay  couples to openly identify their partnerships.  What has become more apparent, however, is this isn't that unprecedented after all.  It's one more pretense by a government  department of "consulting" the community  after they've already decided what they're  intending to give us.  Before meeting with community groups,  StatsCan had already held focus-group testing in which different approaches to identifying lesbian and gay relationships were  tested. No lesbian and gay community  groups appear to have been consulted to  help define the questions to be put forward  in the focus groups.  There are currently three questions on  the census questionnaire which explicitly  exclude lesbians and gays:  Question 2, the "relationship to person  one," is the one in which respondents describe the relationships between people who  live together. Before the 1991 census, the  lesbian and gay media reported that StatsCan  said it would count the number of lesbian  and gay couples who identified themselves  as such using the write-in category "other."  Now, however, StatsCan representatives  have told the lesbian and gay media that  they did not count those responses. It is also  unclear what happened to the data from  same-sex couples who used the categories  "husband/wife" or "common-law partner."  Question 5 asks about the legal marital  status of each member of the household.  Question 6 asks about the common-law  status of each person. For a cohabiting  lesbian or gay couple, there is no way of  answering Question 6 correctly: under some  legislation such relationships are considered  ,"To  common-law, while under others they are  not.  findlay points out that even if these  questions are changed to be inclusive, they  would not result in a count of lesbians and  gays in Canada, just of lesbian and gay  couples. As there would be not way of counting single people or those who do not live  with their partners, the December 9 Coalition is interested in whether the community  would like to see a specific question on  sexual orientation.  StatsCan may be reluctant to consider a  question on sexual orientation because no  governmental level has specific policy on  lesbian and gay issues, unlike other family  relationships-for example, the number of  children in a given region of the country will  affect how governments spend money allocated for services to children.  Lesbiansand gays could, however, make  the argument that, even if no governmental  body has requested such information, our  communities, like religious groups, require  it for our own purposes. And, should a court  challenge force the government to allow  lesbian and gay partners the same benefits as  heterosexuals (Canada Pension Plan benefits, for example), the government may  come to need those figures, findlay points  out.  Currently, StatsCan is only considering  changing Question 2 to include a category  for lesbian and gay partnerships. StatsCan  says it has rejected the idea of changing  questions 5 and 6 after focus group testing  showed it to be unworkable for a variety of  reason. For example, StatsCan says there is  no consensus on a word for "lesbian or gay  relationships;" and the questions may be  seenas controversial, which may mean more  people may refuse to complete census questionnaires. Both would lead to what StatsCan  calls "contaminated," or inaccurate, data.  But findlay points that all census data  on family relationships is currently "contaminated" because it lumps lesbian and gay  lives in with heterosexual ones. However,  she notes, that argument will not sway  StatsCan: "They're interested in gettingdata,  but they're only interested in the data they  can get." She points out that StatsCan is  willing to put up with inaccuracy in the  matter of family relationships if it means  getting a high rate of compliance overall.  If the lesbian and gay community decides it would like to see additions to the  census questions, "it would be a political  strategy to urge people to refuse to complete  the questionnaire," findlay says. This could  make StatsCan nervous enough to make  concessions.  Such a strategy would have to be undertaken very carefully because it is against the  law to refuse to complete the census questionnaire. A community group advocating  a boycott could even be charged with counselling people to commit a crime.  Of course, even if StatsCan should be  convinced of the need to add lesbian and gay  content to its next questionnaire, and the  focus group testing does not show it to be  unworkable, there would be another hurdle:  census questions m ust be approved by cabinet.  Faith Jones thinks she counts whether the  nt counts her or not.  At the two public meetings held by the December 9 Coalition, arguments both for and  against inclusion in the census were put forward. The most common position in favour is  one of improved visibility. No one expects to get accurate data on the 1996, or even the 2001  census: meeting participant barbara findlay points out lag time on collecting accurate data  from a new question of this type might be as high as 25 years. But proponents of the inclusion  of lesbians and gays in Question 2 say the mere fact that it's there will help show that we exist,  whatever number results.  "If there are a lot of us, they won't be able to ignore us," more than one participant at the  public meetings said.  Others were unconvinced: "You notice how well that's worked for women," said  Winnifred Tovey, a lesbian who attended both meetings.  Another meeting participant said the information could be used by many kinds of  researches: for example, academic researchers, advertisers, and lesbian and gay activists  would all be able to use for information on the size, location, and diversity of lesbians and  gays in Canada.  But Juline MacDonnell, who worked as a census-takerduring the 1991 census, points out  that "Scientific data is over-rated. We know we exist. If there's one thing feminists have  learned, it is to trust anecdotal information."  "I don't think it's reason enough to participate in StatsCan's agenda."  The arguments against inclusion are largely about community control and protection.  For example, some participants worried that whatever data gets collected, it will be  interpreted in a hostile manner. StatsCan information is available to anyone who wants it,  so right-wing groups could use the information in a propaganda war against us.  Chris Morrissey, a lesbian participant at the public meetings, said the current political  climate makes this a key concern: "I'm concerned that, given the conservative nature [of the  times] the information is going to be used more against us than for us."  "Scientific data is over-rated. We know we exist. If  there's one thing feminists have learned, it is to  trust anecdotal information."  There is also, at this point, no assurance that the community will have input into  wording, emphasis, or data collection mechanisms.  Even worse, there is no community control over how the information will get used, or  what policies the figures will be used to support.  "I'm not comfortable with it either way: if our numbers come out high, or low. It's  because I'm not comfortable with government policy on gays and lesbians," Tovey said.  There are also some concerns about the security of the information, especially for  closeted people who a re concerned for their safety in their jobs or communities. Activists a re  also worried about the government having information on who is lesbian or gay. In a worst-  case scenario, lesbians and gays who identify themselves could be harassed or assaulted by  a homophobic element of the government, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, or in  government policy should the political climate become more homophobic.  The issue of safety is compounded for lesbians and gay men of colour, says Chris Rahim  of the Vancouver Status of Women. Already targeted by racists, few would be willing to  come out on the census form, she says.  "Instead of achieving visibility, this could end up having the effect of making gays and  lesbians of colour even more invisible," she says, if a census report showed that most gays  and lesbians who identified themselves were white.  The question of what the actual benefits would be to the lesbian and gay community was  also raised. Even those generally in favour of the proposition acknowledged that its value  would be mostly symbolic.  "We get nothing demonstrable but we take a demonstrable risk," findlay says. This  means that lesbians and gay men must decide if unquantifiable benefits such as increased  visibility are worth the risks attendant on this project, and if so, do the potential benefits merit  the amount of energy it would take to attain them.  At the public meetings, participants suggested alternatives to a simple response for or  against inclusion. For example, Morrissey points out that, if lesbian and gay communities  agreed on a need to have information about ourselves, we should look into "taking charge  of our own surveys." She suggested that StatsCan should pay community organizers to  perform this service.  Another alternative would be to get inclusion in the census in a way tha t doesn't involve  lesbians and gay men trying to fit ourselves into other people's definition of what makes a  family.  "It occurs to me that what we might usefully fight for is that we can fill in what we want  to [under "other"] and that they have to count it," said Bet Cecill, a participant at a meeting.  "I am very unhappy with us fitting their model. I think it'll cut our throats short-term and  long-term."  She points out that such a strategy could be extended to other groups who do not  organize their homes around the nuclear family, such as Aboriginal people, who often live  in extended families, or religious groups who live communally.  Macdonnell says her experience trying to force people to fit the form's categories was  extremely frustrating for her and humiliating for the people involved.  "The entire census is flawed~for everyone, whether straight or dyke," she says, citing  the attempt to fix people to one address, one religion, one relationship.  Macdonnell doesn't like the idea of lesbians and gays forcing themselves into whatever  categories StatsCan would accept.  "As I don't like being excluded, nor do I want to be subsumed by straight society, I think  we should just lie a lot on the census form," she says. She calls this "passive-aggressive  protest."  For now, the December 9 Coalition will continue to seek community involvement in  deciding whether to pursue the matter. So far, the bulk of interest has been from white, able-  bodied lesbians and gay men, most of whom are in their late 20's or older. The Coalition plans  to solicit opinions from other sectors of the lesbian and gay communities.  Even from the small, and in some ways homogenous, groups who have met with the  December 9 Coalition so far, several things are clear. One is that more lesbians than gay men  have serious reservations about participation in the census. Another is that there is, so far,  no community consensus on any thing: should webe included in thecensus at all; if we decide  we should, how should we be included and strategies for being included; and alternatives  to the census as a way of counting our community.  JULY/AUGUST 1993 Feature  Interview with "Pandora lawyer" Anne Derrick:  A woman-only space  as reconstructed by Agnes Huang  For two years, Halifax's feminist newspaper, Pandora, was entangled in a human rights  case, fighting off a complaint of "sex discrimination " because the paper refused to publish a letter  written by a man. In March 1992, the adjudicator of the human rights tribunal ruled in favour  of Pandora, affirming its right to maintain  women-only policies and activities [see Kinesis  May 92].  Anne Derrick acted as the lawyer for  Pandora. She was in Vancouver this past February to speak at Vancouver Status of Women's  Recommending Women IV and the National  Association of Women and the Law Conference.  Kinesis also had the opportunity to interview  her [over a breakfast of porridge and orange  juicej. The following is a compilation of Anne  Derrick's words from her speeches and the interview.  Derrick: The complaint arose after there  was an article in Pandora critical of joint  custody. The complainant [a fathers' rights  advocate] contacted the paper to say that he  was distressed by the article and wanted to  submit a response. He was told very politely  he could submit his letter but that it wouldn't  get published because he was a man. He  then filed a complaint with the Nova Scotia  Human Rights Commission [NSHRC].  After the initial investigation process, the  NSHRC determined there were grounds for the  complaint to proceed to the tribunal inquiry  stage. It ivas Pandora's women-only letters  policy that was at issue. The NSHRC did not  take issue with Pandora's two other women-  only policies—editorial and membership—but  the Commission did not see any harm in publishing a "tiny" letter from a man in the paper.  Pandora, however, sazv it as a fundamental  attack on its principles.  Derrick: There was a very strong feeling  that. ..any intrusion by men into this women-  only space would fundamentally change the  paper. Women felt very strongly that one  little letter was absolutely unacceptable.  There were some wonderful expressions of  indignation from the women who would  say, "we know very well what men think; in  fact we can't get away from it, except in  Pandora." Pandora women didn't want to put  energy, time and resources into responding  to men, promoting the ideas of men, and  getting into men's frames of reference.  Dealing ivith the complaint required  Pandora to divert its attention away from the  work it was created to do and focus its energies  on defending its position on men's involvement  in the paper.  Derrick: [When the paper was started in  1985] there was no original discussion about  excluding men. It was simply a natural result of the fact the paper was by, for and  about women. Men weren't the issue. The  paper found itself in this struggle of having  to deal with men being the issue because the  justice system turned the issue around and  made men the focus.  The inquiry not only placed considerable  emotional stress on theivomen involved, but also  a tremendous financial burden on the paper. The  cost of defending its case reached $40,000—  Pandora's annual budget is $5,000.  Pandora had hoped the NSHRC would  have dismissed the case as unfounded after the  initial investigation, foUowing the lead of the  Ontario Human Rights Commission [OHRC]  m the WenDo case. In the Ontario case, a man  filed a complaint after he ivas refused participation in WenDo—a self-defence course for-women.  The OHRC refused to hear the case, calling the  complaint vexatious and not a case of sex discrimination [see Kinesis, Sep. 91].  Unfortu  nately for Pandora, the NSHRC did not share  the same understanding of sex discrimination as  its Ontario counterpart.  Derrick:The [Nova Scotia] HumanRights  Commission saw [Pandora's case] as an example of sex discrimination. They assumed  wrongly that if somebody makes a distinction based on sex, that's automatically sex  discrimination. In the inquiry itself, the Commission led no evidence. Once Pandora admitted, quite openly and candidly, they had  made that distinction, the Commission said  Anne Derrick speaking at VSW's  Recommending Women IV  their position [that Pandora had "discriminated" against thecomplainant] was proved.  What happened in [the case of] Pandora  illustrates how these terms can be treated as  being somehow neutral. [But of course,] sex  discrimination is always intended to protect  women, and sexual orientation is obviously  intended to protect gays and lesbians. The  Pandora case is an example of a human rights  commission that saw sex discrimination as  being available to protect men against  women. That just goes to show they had no  understanding of what sex discrimination  really means, which is certainly worrisome.  Like with many other feminist neivspapers,  Pandora's role extends beyond publishing material ivrittenby women and of interest towomen.  The paper also serves as a place for women's  organizing and as a ivomen -positive space. During thecourse of the inquiry, it became apparent  that for women in Halifax, Pandora ivas much  more than just a feminist newspaper.  Derrick: The paper operates as a safe  place for women to express themselves; a  place where women could feel that the exchange of ideas and the dynamics of discussion were in a community in which they felt  comfortable. Pandora provides women with  the opportunity to speak about violence issues—of persona 1 violence issues which they  could share with other women.  One women who testified [at the inquiry]—a counsellor—spoke about how she  would write about addictions in Pandora  because substance abuse for women was  such a hidden problem. [In Pandora,] she  was able to reach women who otherwise  wouldn't have access to this information  because they certainly weren't publicly looking for it. Even for me—someone who had  written for the paper and advised them from  time to time—it was really an eye-opening  experience to appreciate more fully what the  paper meant, what function it served and  what it accomplished. 1 had no genuine  sense of the depth or the significance of a  women's paper until I heard the evidence  which I called being articulated in the course  of the inquiry.  When first confronted with having to respond to the complaint, there was discussion  among Pandora women about whether or not to  even engage in the human rights process. Some  women felt that the process ivas "alien and  hostile," and tliat Pandora should not legitimize it by participating in the process. Other  women took the position that Pandora couldnot  ignore the complaint.  Derrick: There were women who felt  there [were] very important principles at  stake here and [Pandora was] going to need  to defend this complaint to protect what  Pandora is endeavouring to do, and also to  protect the efforts of other women-only organization and other disadvantaged groups.  Pandora saw this case as having implications  potentially for people of colour, lesbians,  and other entities engaging in activities that  would exclude a dominant group.  In strategizing for its defence, Pandora  decided it could not take for granted that the  tribunal understood what sex discrimination  really is, so Pandora started from the beginning. The first step ivas to lay out in detail just  how women are historically disadvantaged in  relation to men.  Derrick: We went to enormous lengths  to actually do that, starting with a historical  analysis of women's status in Nova Scotia's  society. We called a great number of witnesses, both lay and expert, to testify to what  was perfectly obvious to all the women in  the room.  I think we were right to have done that,  because there was a finding in the decision  that women are materially disadvantaged as  compared to men on the basis of sex. It is not  as though the adjudicator said, "I really  didn't need to listen to all this evidence and  it was unnecessary, and I would have taken  notice of it anyway." There was no suggestion of that in his decision, and I'm glad we  didn't just assume that everybody knows  that [women are historically disadvantaged].  I'm left hoping that the Pandora case has  dealt with the issue in Nova Scotia, but I'm  not confident it has.  One of the more obvious defences Pandora  considered was the freedom of expression argument—a newspaper's freedom to print what it  wants. Pandora even had at its disposal a pre-  Charier case, decided in 1979, in which the  Supreme Court of Canada upheld a newspaper's  right to determine its content.  The case involved the Gay Alliance Toward  Equality and the Vancouver Sun newspaper.  The Gay Alliance brought a human rights complaint against the Vancouver Sun because the  newspaper refused to publish its advertisement.  The Gay Alliance argued it was being discriminated against because there was a prohibition  against discrimination in relation to "services  customarily available to the public" and that  advertising fell into that category.  The case was fought all the way to the  Supreme Court of Canada. There, the Court  ruled that, while advertising is a service customarily available to thepublic, newspapers have the  freedom to decide what they will or will not  accept and print. For Pandora, it would have  been easy to adopt similar arguments in defence  of its case. But they rejected that strategy.  Derrick: On its face, [freedom of expression] would certainly ha ve been a very strong  beginning argument for Pandora to have  used—to say, "we're a newspaper and we  can determine what we want to put in our  newspaper."  But, Pandora saw that there were obvious implications...because of what it might  mean for other disadvantaged groups in the  reversal of the Pandora situation. Pandora  decided that [relying on a freedom of expression argument] was not consistent with  its principles and interests in promoting  equality for disadvantaged groups. If we  did, then that situation might replicate itself  so that Pandora's win could be somebody  else's loss.  In an era in which there is now actually  an enshrined freedom of expression protection under the Charter, for Pandora to make  these arguments along the lines of the Vancouver Sun could very much detract from the  ability of any [other] "gay alliance" in the  future being able to ensure such an advertisement could be placed in a mainstream  newspaper.  Pandora was looking for a solid victory to  safeguard the policies and activities of women's  organizations and other historically disadvantaged groups. In rejecting a freedom of expression defence, Pandora then turned to the argument that its policies and activities were equality-promoiingand thus protected under the Charter.  Derrick: Pandora put all her eggs in the  equality basket, saying that any definition of  discrimination under the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act had to be interpreted in a  way that was consistent with the Charter.  That required an understanding of women's  disadvantage and required a finding that a  [women-only] activity or organization  should be permitted to continue because it  was equality-promoting and therefore not  discriminatory in law.  The evidence we led to show that  Pandora was an equality-promoting entity,  was the evidence that was accepted by the  adjudicator.  The ruling by the tribunal was a very good  decision in setting out the boundaries of the  meaning of sex discrimination. Tliedecision also  sets a positive precedence for supporting the  equality-promoting activities of other historically disadvantaged groups. But women in Nova  Scotia cannot rest assured that the NSHRC has  gotten the message on the meaning of sex discrimination.  Derrick: I don't think [the NSHRC] appreciates that [their pursuing the case] really  undermined a lot of people's confidence in  the Commission and it made people think  that if Pandora could be prosecuted in this  way, then what does it all amount to? It  doesn't amount to any protection for those  of us who are vulnerable.  The Pandora case was not the first time  Derrick defen dedfem in is t issues. She previously  acted as counsel to Dr. Henry Morgentaler and  the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League,  and was co-counsel for a coalition of equality-  seeking groups in Seaboyer and Gayme [concerning the rape shield law]. But she maylongbe  wearing the label as the "Pandora lawyer"—a  label she doesn't mind.  Derrick: I certainly have a lot of gratitude for being able to do the case because I  think it's a really important case [and] it was  a dynamic and enriching experience. This  was much more of a consensus process where  in every major decision, and even in lots of  minor ones, Pandora was very involved. Part  of the strength of the whole case was that  [Pandora was] so centrally involved and  wanted to be, which was consistent with  their natural processes. I look back with a  great sense of accomplishment that we were  successful. It was a big win and a true win.  We didn't compromise anything.

This year's annual Kinesis Benefit that took  place on June 16th proved once and for all that yes, Kinesis does have the best  volunteers and staff in the history of the world. Production co-ordinator Anne  Jew, long-time arts reviewer/ed board member Kathleen Oliver, rock-solid  news reporter/ed board member Shannon e.

It also must be noted that had it not  been for the efforts of ed boarder Faith Jones in the sound equipment hunt, and  Annie Bailey and Jolene Clark flicking those sound board switches and  plugging in those amps, the evening would have consisted of listening to  various people shout at the top of their lungs from the stage.  Acts included a variety of performers: Mercedes Baines, cub, Sook-Yin  Lee, Kiss and Tell, and, perhaps the most surprising of all, Kathy March and  Miche Hill (who belted out a couple of soulful tunes much to the audience's  and the organizers' open-mouthed shock).

And like rap music, the central  (and often most recognized and heard) voice  in dub poetry that represents black struggle  is male.  Yet dubbing, as an artistic form that  combines diverse sounds and rhythms, also  involves the politics of voice and speech—  who speaks about what, and who listens.  Seen in this light, the inclusion of women's  voices in dub becomes crucial for the open-  ...in addition to...the  liberation of Black  people, women have to  deal with...sexism,  with violence, with  relationships with  women in a sexist and  heterosexist society...  ing up of that space for the telling/talking of  women's issues and experiences. The recent  VancouverFreePressFestival in Mayhosted  various spoken-word performances, one of  which was dub poetry. The evening's only  female dub poet/artist was Toronto-based  Afua Cooper.  "We need, yes  for the people to cleanse themselves  to respect themselves  and to know  that woman degradation  Black woman degradation  Black people degradation  From "A True Revolution"—Memories Have  Tongue  Within dub poetry, a woman's voice is  so important because, as Afua Cooper sees  it, "it seems there are issues that only the  women are dealing with." One crucial issue  that separates women and men, saysCooper,  is the fact that "women have children and  are often the ones left with them when the  cookie crumbles."  Cooper says that in addition to issues  around the liberation of Black people, women  have to deal with issues of sexism around  their bodies and their work, with violence,  with relationships with women in a sexist  and heterosexist society, and with their  childrens' futures.  When asked about the potential conflict  within the dub movement between raising  the importance of issues of "Black liberation" and those of "women's liberation,"  Cooper responds: "racism and sexism are  not divorced from each other. Liberation  should be complete and holistic." In fact, she  says, what she "strives for as both a woman  and a poet is just a complete liberation that is  not negotiable."  "but Jamaica people have a saying  'sorry ft mawgah dawg  mawgah dawg tun roun bite yuh'."  From "Founding Peoples,"—Memories Have  For Cooper, dub allows for the freedom  of expression within a wide range of issues,  political and personal. The versatility of the  form frees the voice from restrictive poetic  conventions. As Cooper explains, "dub is  not just reciting. It is injected with emotions,  music, street sounds and so on." The accessibility of dub's language and style enables it  to "it gives back to people their own voice,  their own talk." As such, dub is infused with  the rhythms and musicality of people's voices  and experiences; it is the patois, the dialect, or  "Nation language" of those who have previously been disempowered.  Dub is therefore an "affirmation or a  reaffirmation of your whole self, of who you  are." In this sense, it becomes what she  describes as an "earth poetry" that connects  people and their experiences with their various geographic spaces.  In her work, Memories Have Tongue,  Cooper gives tongue through dubbing to  memories lost or stolen through history.  Invoking these forgotten voices, her project  becomes an archeological unearthing or recovery of them, so that she can "poetically  celebrate them." For this reason, within her  work, "there is a strong sense of place and  history and of the whole feeling of coming  from somewhere of being rooted."  She writes in "500 Years of Discovery":  "I am still trying to understand my place in  this place called the Americas. Still trying to  understand my place in this new world, in  this hemisphere. I'm still trying to understand my relationship with this land. I, island woman, Black African Jamaican woman  whose ancestry sprang from another continent, another hemisphere, am still trying to  understand my place in the Americas."  In her attempt to understand her place  in the Americas, Cooper addresses the historical circumstances of how "she came to be  here in the first place," beginning with the  forced exodus of Africans by the European  trade in African peoples. She explains: "I  have to come to terms with my living here,  with the history of the place and with what  happened to the people who were here before."  And, as a Caribbean woman, she must  acknowledge the genocide of the native  Arawaks by the Spanish. The poem,  "Atabeyra," is dedicated to the memory of  the "Great Mother of the Arawaks." Similarly, having made her home in Canada, she  questions what has and is happening to the  Aboriginal peoples in North America.  Cover graphic of Rio Bueno, Trelawney, Jamaica  Afua Cooper  Cooper elaborates that in her work, "she  may be attempting a kind of reconciliation  with the people and with the land, with a  land not originally mine but which, now in  this century, is mine. I am embracing this  land. I am a daughter of this land which also  means to pay respect, to acknowledge that  there were and are other people here and  what happened to them."  Out of this respect comes her commitment to coalition-building. Simply put, "the  way forward, if we are to have any success in  the struggle, is through cross-cultural coali-  "I, island woman, Black  African Jamaican  woman whose ancestry  sprang from another  continent, another  hemisphere, am still  trying to understand my  place in the Americas."  tion-building because we are living a kind of  anti-life, a death, not just in Canada, but in  the whole West and in many other parts of  the world."  Although coalition building may look  like a simple project of coming together,  with all our differences intact, in order to  tackle problems in a sexist, and increasingly  racist society, Cooper cautions that it's not  so. Drawing from her experience, she says,  "there are lots of fights and conflicts, but we  have to really learn about each other. First,  there has to be a crossing or a cross-over."  Which involves "a great deal of trial and  error."  Despite these difficulties, Cooper "gets  « her strength" by constantly challenging the  .2 structures that seek to oppress and silence us  JS with her work with grassroots and commu-  £ nity-oriented organizations, and with her  >• poetry. And through her poetry, she contin-  , ues to give voice to those experiences through  which we also find strength.   Charmaine Perkins is from the Caribbean  living in Vancouver. She'd like to thank D.  Lydia Masemola for her contribution to this  project.  JULY/AUGUST 1993  13 Arts  Folk Festival:  Women  previewed  by Kathleen Oliver  VANCOUVER FOLK MUSIC  FESTIVAL  Jericho Beach Park  July 16-18  One of the many traditions at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, which celebrates  its 16th anniversary this year, is presenting a  strong line-up of female performers. Last  year's slate included legends like Buffy  Sainte-Marie, Cris Williamson, Heather  Bishop, and Rhiannon, as well as relative  newcomers like Ani DiFranco from New  York, who has since been gaining a solid  following in North America.  them could dance, but all of them could sing.  I had to listen for a good many years before  I got a chance to sing in that family! I'm  almost 44 years old and I'm just now getting  my turn!"  Purkey began to get her turn about five  years ago when she was invited to play at a  union rally for striking miners in Virginia. A  "crash course in labour history" and other  union engagements followed, as did attention from established artists like Ronnie  Gilbert. All of which has helped to launch  her full-time singingcareer—outside the family. The festival marks her Canadian debut.  This year's festival also features a spotlight on a capella groups from various traditions. The Gospel Harmonettes of Demopolis,  Roulez Filletes (left to right on top) Yannick Guillox, Evelyne Girardon,  (bottom) Marie-Pierre Villermaux, Sylvie Berger, Solange Panis  This year's line-up also features a mixture of familiar and new faces. Here's a  sampling of what's in store when the festival  hits Jericho Beach Park July 16-18.  Among the acts who need little introduction to Vancouver audiences are American humourist Kate Clinton, New Zealand's  yodelling sisters, The Topp Twins, folk legend Rosalie Sorrels, and homegrown singer-  songwriter Ferron.  Many Vancouverites will also be familiar with Seattle's Ranch Romance, whose  spirited country swing and energetic performances endeared them to kd lang fans  across the continent when they opened for  lang on a tour in 1989. Despite minor personnel changes, the band's latest offering,  Blue Blazes, suggests that their live performances will once again leave audiences dazzled.  Ranch Romance are part of a spotlight  on women in the contemporary country  music scene. Among the other country  women are Heather My les, whose 1992 release, Just Like Old Times, is full of great  songs, great singing, and a wonderful mixture of tough-and-sensitive attitudes.  There's also Elaine Purkey, a bluegrass  singer who remembers all-night jams with  her extended family from the time she was a  baby in West Virginia. Says Purkey, "There  were fourteen kids in my Mom's family...  Some of them could play guitar and most of  Alabama have been going strong in their  hometown (pop. 8,000) for nearly 20 years,  and though there have been various line-up  changes, three of the original members still  form the heart of the group—this despite all  of them having day jobs and performing  Jenny Cardenas  some 100-150 engagements each year. Their  rich harmonies and infectious sound have  made the group a staple in their Marengo  County headquarters—more recently, they  have been drawing raves at folk festivals in  the US.  Anothera capella group, France's Roulez  Fillettes (the idiomatic translation is "right  on, girls") have drawn lavish praise for their  ~ intricate harmonies and unconventional take  § on traditional love songs. The "roulez" in  = their name also refers both to the group's  1 distinctive styleof harmonizing and the "roll-  g ing" choreography of their stage show.  .£•        Among the solo folk artists:    Jenny  •§ Cardenas makes her Canadian debut at the  a. Folk Festival. Cardenas is one of Bolivia's  foremost singers and guitarists. Her activities in the women's community include having composed the score for a 1989 film about  women's rights, Yo Tambien Soy Persona (I  Am Also a Person).   Cardenas' songs are  simple and powerful, and her skilled guitar  work provides the perfect accompaniment  to her voice.  Cate Friesen is a Toronto-based singer-  songwriter originally from thePrairies. That  Prairie consciousness infuses her songs,  Robin Holcomb  which are both autobiographical and politically conscientious. Friesen has been gaining a following through appearances at  women's community events, and her clear,  unpretentious music has been drawing high  praise from critics.  Seattle's Robin Holcomb has deservedly been getting lots of attention in the  mainstream rock/pop music press since her  1990 debut album. Her second solo release,  Rockabye, seems destined for the same kind  of praise. Holcomb, a ten-year veteran of  New York's experimental music scene,  makes music that defies simple categorization: it's folk meets blues meets avant-garde  jazz meets pop, and her work has drawn  comparisons to Suzanne Vega, Tori Amos,  Joni Mitchell, Rickie Lee Jones, and others.  But none of these comparisons adequately conveys the emotional impact of  Holcomb's songs. Says Holcomb, "I consider singing and songwriting to be an extremely powerful way to confess things that  might otherwise go unsaid. Small songs can  tell big stories, can name places where the  heart is standing."  And that's exactly what the songs on  Rockabye, with their spare, incisive poetry,  do so brilliantly. The title track is a warm,  gospel-tinged waltz that (unlike the sadistic  child's lullaby from which it takes its title)  only hints at the pain from which it continually offers loving consolation: "What settles  out at the bottom/Of a bottle of wine/Are  promises, lies/You can choose to believe."  Holcomb's gentle, lilting voice and earthy  piano offer as much comfort as "the blanket  to cover you /when you go down" that her  words describe.  And in "The Natural World," the album's closing track, Holcomb surveys the  damage that human beings have done to  each other and to the earth, and finally—  with a gospel chorus in gentle support—  asks, "Who can read these directions/for ,  turning around?/Who do you know/I can  confess to?"  Chances are that Holcomb, along with  the other women at the Folk Festival, will be  making their confessions to an enthralled  crowd, who will be anxious to hear more.  Kathleen Oliver is a regular, make that,  compulsive Kinesis contributor, and an even  more compulsive festival-goer.  14  JULY/AUGUST 1993 Arts  Powell Street Festival:  Strength and celebration  by Monika Kin Gagnon  17TH POWELL STREET FESTIVAL  Oppenheimer Park, Vancouver  July 31 - August 1  The Powell Street Festival is a celebration for Japanese Canadians that has taken  place annually at Vancouver's Oppenhiemer  Park since 1977. Geographically situated in  Japantown, the heart of Vancouver's Japanese community in pre-World War Two,  this site also metaphorically demarcates the  spiritual journey of JapaneseCanadianssince  their branding as Enemy Aliens in 1942.  Last year's festival theme was "Coming  Home," marking the 50th anniversary of  uprooting and internment of some 22,000  individuals of Japanese descent from the  west coast. Says last year's festival coordinator Leslie Komori, "The preservation and  growth of Japanese Canadian arts and culture throughout the difficult years of disper  sal and assimilation reflect the community's  survival capacity and its will to heal and  rebuild. The Powell Street Festival isa physical inca ma tion of the will to come together."  Eileen Kage, this year's festival coordinator and a musician with Sawagi Taiko, an  all-women's taiko group, say that while "not  everything is finalized yet," this year's festival will reflect the growing strength of the  Japanese Canadian community and the continuous evolution of the Powell Street festivals.  Born in response to the harsh consequences of historically xenophobic Canadian government policies, the Festival has  evolved to become much more than a celebration. It will highlight colourful costumes  and displays, demonstrations of a variety of  martial arts, a wide array of foods from  barbequed salmon to yaki udon, presentations of traditional Sa-do tea ceremonies,  Ikebana flower arranging, and omikoshi,  the vigorous and frenzied carrying of a portable shrine essential to Japanese festivals.  But in addition to these activities at  Oppenheimer Park, the Festival will host  performances and readings at the Firehall  Arts Centre, round table discussions at the  Vancouver Japanese Language School and  photo exhibitions, displays and a fund-raising silent auction at the Vancouver Buddhist  Church.  And while the first Festival was characterized by its presentation of mainly traditional dance, theatre and music, it now showcases a variety of contemporary visual and  performing arts as well as older traditional  forms with which Japanese culture is associated. This evolution from the traditional to  an inclusion of contemporary forms of Japanese culture reflects and is reflected in the  ever-changing identities of Japanese-Canadians.  MamiMiyatawasartisticdirectorofthe  Festival from 1979 to 1984 and a festival  board member for six years. In the oral  histories, gathered and edited by Linda  Uyehara Hoffman in the book Kikya: Coming  Home to Powell Street, published on the occasion of last year's festival, Miyata says, "I  believed Japanese Canadians had their own  history and culture...When I read about Japanese Canadian or Japanese American history injapan, it was written in Japanese from  a Japanese perspective, and always there.  "Even before I came here, I felt there  was something wrong with this. They have  spent 100 years of their own history, how  can they be the same. Then I met the Powell  Street Festival people. I felt 'Yeah, they have  their own way.'"  Demonstrating their own way Ja panese-  Canadian women, are challenging the powerful stereotypes and structural social realities of submission and invisibility. The  number of women involved in key ways in  the organizing of the festival has been steadily increasing over the years.  This year, as in others, there are lots of  women at the center of the organization,  says Kage. And there are lots of issues that  continue to be raised.  Kage says a particular issue for her is  that she's "still working on ideas around  being of mixed heritage and relating with  other Asian cultures." The reality of mixed  Japanese heritage in the Canadian context is  a difficult one. Kage cites the pressure on  Japanese Canadians to assimilate following  the war, and the high rate of intermarriage,  as strong deterrents to the continuity and  strength of Japanese-Canadian culture.  The show of cultural contributions by  Japanese-Canadian women also promises  to be impressive. Chiyoko Szavnics, a  saxiphonist of mixed Japanese, Hungarian  and Yugoslavian descent from Toronto is  this year's feature performer at the Firehall  Arts Centre [see calendarj. Szavnics' compositions mix traditional music forms in a style  she has uniquely developed since the late  80s.  Curator Irene H. Kuniyuki will coordinate the "Homecoming '92 Interment Camp  Bus Tour Photography Exhibition" at the  Vancouver Buddhist Church. And Kay  Odaka's "F-Stop 8 Konnection" will be exhibited at the Firehall, drawing from family  photo archives and her own images. Odaka  says archival photographs taken before and  during the Second World War will be  mounted along with photographs of female  family members, exploring "how in-  tergenerational, cross-continental and opposite gender elements in my family can be  linked through a camera," and further comparing "how my grandfather photographed  women compared to the wayl photographed  women."  Works by Toronto filmmaker Midi  Onodera and Vancouver filmmakerFumiko  Kiyooka will screen in the film program at  the Firehall. Onodera has been making films  since 1981 and is perhaps best known for her  1987 film, The Displaced View, which explores three generations of Japanese-Canadian women in her family. Kiyooka's training in dance figures strongly in her work  such as Akura (1985), and Creation, a powerful explorationof the woman's birthing body.  Toronto writers Tamai Kobayashi—and  festival coordinators hope Mona Oikawa—  will present reading of poetry. The two collaborated on the recently released All Names  Spoken last year, [see Kinesis, Apr. 93J which  has been described as a "beautiful and well-  crafted book with the tough humour of streetwise dykes fusing with lyrical descriptions  of Japanese customs."

I've never even been  comfortable with the idea of fashion. Nonetheless, I was intrigued by Hirsute, Her Suite,  a film /video presentation and panel discussion on lesbians and style that took place as  part of Out on Screen, Vancouver's Lesbian  and Gay Film Festival, last month.  The evening's first video was Carla  Wolf's BodyHair,a fairly straight-ahead look  a t how we choose to grow or remove hair on  different parts of the body. Scenes of shaving, waxing, and plucking (which drew  strong reactions from the audience) are interspersed with interview clips providing  historical and political perspectives on the  removal of women's body hair.  Wolf's video served as a sort of primer  for Tami Gold's Juggling Gender, a fascinating profile of Jennifer Miller, a fully bearded  woman who makes her living as a circus  performer in New York. Miller, a lesbian,  has obviously had plenty of time to think  about the implications of her gender presen  tation, and she is extremely articulate abou  it. Her sideshow performance as the "beard  ed lady," for instance, is probably the most  head-spinningly feminist thing Coney Island has ever seen. It's amazing how the  simple fact of facial hair can serve as the  point of intersection between the world of  the circus and feminist politics, and thebirth-  place of something utterly new.  Miller is a thoroughly engaging personality—her impersonation of male drag  queens strutting their stuff in New York's  Lesbian and Gay Pride Day parade is both  hilarious and thought-provoking. As Miller  points out, this "faggot behaviour" comes  from an empowered response to being looked  at—a place of power to which women rarely  have access.  Ultimately, says Miller, our definition  of gender has far more to do with the way in  which we interact with society than the way  we look.  Which doesn't mean that the way we  look isn't an interesting starting point for  talking about lesbian identity; and Karen  Everett's Framing Lesbian Fashion does just  that. Focusing almost exclusively on the San  Francisco lesbian community, Everett  presents a potted history of lesbian fashion,  divided into sections with titles like "Lesbians Stick Up for Lipstick" and "Dressed for  Sex: The Butch-Femme Revival." A number  of lesbian "experts," including Joann Loulan,  Sally Gearhardt, and Kitty Tsui, talk theory  and practice about everything from the plaid-  shirt "uniforms " of the 70s to the more recent  burgeoning of the leather scene.  Everett's video is thoroughly charming—smart, self-conscious, and witty—but  it also steps a little too softly over some very  tangled issues. While it aspires to being the  lesbian feel-good flick of the year, this "everything's groovy" attitude takes an awful lot  for granted.  Beyond a few wisecracks about plaid  shirts, for instance, there is little serious  attention given to the enormous contribution that feminism—lesbian feminists—has  made to the possibility of lesbian visibility.  The prevailing attitude of Everett's interview subjects seems to be that the lesbian-  feminist movement stifled fashion expressiveness, sinceobjectifying ourselves oreach  other was considered "bad"—and phew!  aren't we glad that's over?  While there is certainly something to  this argument, it is a disservice to the history  of the women's movement to make Sally  Gearhardt the sole representative of lesbian-  feminists, as panellist Frances Wasserlein  pointed out in the post-screening discussion. Especially when Gearhardt keeps making sweeping statements like, "I realized  that the most exciting sex in the world was  power sex" (my italics).  Everett's point seems to be: lipstick is  good, dressing up is good, role-play is good,  S/M is good—anything lesbians want to do,  wear, or be is good. And that may be fine in  places like San Francisco (the home-base for  Framing Lesbian Fashion) or Vancouver, but I  think it just might make a small-town dyke's  head spin—so we have to be careful about  images that present themselves as "universal." Also, as Wasserlein pointed out, we  should be wary of anyone who tells us that  dressing in a certain way will give us freedom . That sort of sales pitch has been used to  the advantage of the seller far more often  than it has been an instrument of liberation.  Despite the criticisms I'm making now,  at the time of viewing I was quite swept  away by Framing Lesbian Fashion—the video  is clever and lots of fun to watch. Its goal  seems to be to charm, rather than challenge  viewers—which might be okay if some of  the issues the video addresses weren't so  challenging in themselves.  Fortunately, some of those issues were  chewed over in the panel discussion that  followed the screenings. Moderated by  Margo Dunn, the panel featured Body Hair's  director, Carla Wolf; Montreal filmmaker/  video artist Maureen Bradley (whose videos, She Thrills Me and Safe Sex is Hot Sex,  were screened as part of Out on Screen's  Shorts for Women program); hair salon proprietor Gina Derry; and feminist historian  and educator Frances Wasserlein. There  was also a great deal of input from an audience eager to talk.  Framing Lesbian Fashion seemed to provoke the most discussion, or at least to be the  jumping-off place for most of the issues  raised.  Much of the discussion focused on issues of power, roles, and communication.  Although our fashion choices are an important language, as Wolf pointed out, this set of  shared codes can never be the sum total of  our identities.   Wasserlein mentioned the  Although our fashion  choices are an  important  language...this set of  shared codes can never  be the sum total of our  identities.  importance of remembering our histories, to  respect and value what has gone before. Our  cultural work is far more important to the  definition of our community, she added,  than simply what we wear—although "fashion" is certainly a part of the whole.  Maureen Bradley pointed out that, just  because our roles are constructed doesn't  mean they aren't real. This is an important  perspective to bring to the whole discussion  of butch-femme—a role-play that acknowl-  1988 W 4th & Maple  Vancouver, B.C.  V6J 1M5  733-3511  edges the way in which we are all defined by  heterosexuality (even if we are defined in  opposition to it)—and plays with it. Bradley  talked about her current video project, Diary  of a Butch-o-phobe, in which she explores her  own "fear and loathing" of butch attributes  as a form of internalized homophobia.  Bradley has now chosen to mark herself as a  lesbian by shaving her head—a choice that  means facing her fears of butchness as well  as opening herself to other people's homo/  lesbophobia.  Bradley also pointed out that these acknowledged codes often have a strong relationship to power—power we are either  giving to ourselves or not giving to ourselves. Gina Derry expressed the feeling that  regardless of what the codes might communicate, real power comes from within one's  own mind and body, not from one's hair or  clothes.  For although they are just surfaces, hair  and clothing do provide a provocative starting place for discussions of all the issues  informing lesbian identity, as the panel and  group discussion made amply evident.  But while Out on Screen's program provided an opportunity to discuss some important issues, there was a serious failure on  the part of the programmers to include the  perspective of any women of colour either as  filmmakers/video artists or as panellists.  Considering that much of the impetus for  the "new look" or politics of the lesbian  community has come from race politics, a  panel more representative of our community's diversity would have contributed a vitally different—and crucial—perspective to  a discussion of issues of power and identity.  The Symposium is a welcome addition  to Out on Screen's line-up, but let's hope that  next year a more inclusive range of voices  has a chance to be heard.

Way   TELLING RELATIONS: SEXUALITY  AND THE FAMILY  grunt gallery  Vancouver, BC  June 15-July 10  The first time my father sees my lover,  he whispers: "She looks like a man. Is she a  lesbian?"  This is his belated lesson in life, as a  father to a daughter he does not know how  to raise. It is a warning, in case I do not know  about such things. So I pretend I don't know  and reassure him that I will remember to ask  her.  Most of the pieces of Telling Relations:  Sexuality and the Family remind me of the  stupid, sad stories about my own family.  They remind me of puzzles and blocked out  events of childhood and adolescence.  The use of personal stories, experiences  and photos as material, as curator Larissa  Lai describes it, is sometimes intense. When  Deanne Achong's Blushed White, d  vealed, speaks of the different meanings  that the same symbols have for a mother and  daughter. I see, in Mehat's work, the constant struggle with my mother, as embodied  by clothing and hair. In my teens, I never  wore the clothes she bought for me—with  guilt I knew I would not be a model daughter. Now, wearing clothes my mother chooses  gives her small happiness, and I feel closer to  her because this is the way we are able to get  along. How true, as Mehat writes in the  catalogue: "Hinged onto my mother's approval is an implicit hope."  Most striking is Mehat's sta tement, stuck  up beside her piece, which is an apology and  In two of Achong's photos, she uses the  medical instruments representing her parents to touch her own body. There is a strange  closeness, familiarity, but also clinical distance implied.

Mehat apologizes "for not asking her permission to speak of such matters in public"  and for using her mother's photograph. She  also promises never to use any of her family  members in any shape or form as subject  matter.  The statement adds another personal  dimension to the theme or issues presented  in Telling Relations. How ironic that one of  the phrases in Mehat's piece is: "I can bear  the weight of anything except your disappointment." I have collected many strange  photos of my mother in a plastic bag. She is  a carefree university student, a beauty queen  and a bride in a rented studio gown, posing  with my father. I have always thought I  c   could use these photos any way I chose  :g   because I think of them as part of me, so  <   Mehat's statement is particularly startling.  ■S Kathleen  Dick's acrylic painting,  =   Demeter's Despair, is also about a mother-  •£   daughter relationship and the changes thata  o   daughter's developing sexuality brings. For  °"  me, this painting is an aesthetic depiction of  awkward, shameful puberty. When I got my  period my indignant mother asked, "Don't  they teach you about those things in school?"  She made me wear an old party dress to  school so no one would see the bale of hay  between my legs.  I don't have as many photos of my  father, but when I look at the few, I wonder  where I see my face in his face. He looks  serious, complacent and innocent, then I  wonder if I imagined my childhood.

Mootoo recreates the colour photocopied portraits of her father and herself with  ripped pieces exchanged. One of her eyes is  substituted by one of her father's and she  wears his beard. The text is mostly a telephone conversation in which Mootoo identifies her multiple perspectives (as a woman,  a brown woman, and a lesbian) and her  father rejects none of them, especially the  latter.

This term is obviously accepted by  Thobani, since you have quoted her using it.  However, the term strikes me as offensive. Is  Thobani purple? It seems horribly presumptuous to label people of African or Asian  origin "coloured" when people of European  origin are decidedly pink. Perhaps you could  use an alternative term, such as "women of  a minority," or, if that is too unwieldy, "minority women."  Also, please allow me to add that  Thobani seems to be an energetic, dedicated  and effective voice for women and I wish her  well in her obvious deserved position as  president of NAC.

I  am glad to see that Kinesis is opening a  debate that must be continued throughout  Canada. The increasing co-optation of male  violence against women into "law and order" and "mental health" agendas is occurring in all provincial levels, as well as at the  Federal level under the rubric of "crime  prevention and community safety."  All of us in our work need to be sharing  their tactics and our strategies. The proliferation of right wing "victims' rights' organisations," and the variousgovernment responses  to violence against women by increasing the  disempowerment of feminist organisations  and advocacy groups under the guise of  increasing support to "victim assistance programs" I suspect is happening everywhere.  I could not agree with Johannah more—  this category of "victims of crimes—[is]  degendering women's experience, our work  and our demands for change." Our autonomy  is under severe attack from all fronts.  I agree with Johannah again—"Let the  struggle continue."

We believe that in order to address the  issue of violence against women and government services, women need a safe forum  to communicate and to begin to develop a  common ground. Your paper provides an  opportunity for such an exchange.  We also believe that it is time to commend those women who have been doing  front-line work with survivors for many  years. Violence against women is not a new  problem. It's time for women to speak out  and share their realities.  Sincerely,  K. Redwood  T. Hurd  Gabriola, BC  Stopping the  co-option 4  Kinesis:  I am writing in agreement with the article written by Johannah Pilot in "Co-opting  Centres," [see Kinesis, Jun. 93.J  It is clear that the NDP government  does not support fem inist front-line workers  with its "Stopping the Violence" initiatives  and its "law and order" and "mental health"  agendas.  The women of DAWN Vancouver are  afraid that the government's increased involvement in the agendas of front-line workers will result in a decline in services for  women seeking progressive change for them-  selves and other women.  As women with disabilities, we continue to need advocates of our own choice to  ensure that we successfully get help from  hospitals, welfare, lawyers, police, et cetera,  and we need these women to work with us  to demand changes in these systems so that  they successfully protect and support us.  Ms. Pilot points out that instead of providing us with more advocates working on  our behalf for proactive changes, the NDP is  providing more professional services which respond only to our mental and emotional needs or  prepare us to be witnesses for Crown Counsel.  Thus, the government lias changed grass-roots  groups through funding contracts so that they  fulfil the government agenda.  The ongoing co-opting of front-line  workers continues. If we lose too many grassroots groups, disabled women will continue  to experience isolation, fear and victimization from the justice system as well as from  the men who attack us and we will lose out  on opportunities to fight those who oppress  Sincerely,  Julie Linkletter,  DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN)  Vancouver  f'jffj^      p \      Western Canada's  V   /  Introducing Amplesize Park's  ltz£&t&   *^          Lesbian & Oay  V /  own line of clothing  New hours:  \ f^7 Book &                           Bookstore  i    r     *"'     Art Emporium  4S                                      Open Daily 10am to 11 pm  tel  Mon, Tues, Thurs 11 -6  Fri 11-7  Sat 10:30-4:30  M*  Closed Wed & Sun  Everything Imaginable for Lesbians and Gay Men  l      Quality consignment  Books   Erotica  \     clothing  Cards  Magazines  Jewelry  Latex & Lube  N  1    Size 14... plus  Travel Guides  Potography Books  l^s*  1        Amplesize Park  Novelties  Video Rentals  Jr  I        5766 Fraser Street  T-Shirts  Video Sales  /         Vancouver, BC  t      \  V5W 2Z5  1221  ThurlowCat Davie),Vancouver.

I was that  companion and I remember that day. The  reason we were talking about the press was  because we had both said "Hi" to Sarah and  she had given us a dead stare.  My partner was Henri Robideau, who  built the first darkroom at Press Gang. He  was there only about two or three months.  He left a fter having Sarah move into what he  thought of as his space, (since he had built  the darkroom and all the equipment was  his), tell him he would have to sign up on the  roster if he wanted darkroom time, and that  he had to go to three consciousness-raising  meetings when he wanted to get to work. He  realized that the direction the press was  going did not suit his priorities and left.  I was his partner even then and remember that Sarah treated him as an annoyance  and an outsider from the beginning and  could not remember who he was even then,  but Schraeder, Ed, or Richard, could verify  that Henri Robideau did make the first darkroom and was one of the people there at the  beginning.  I know that this story is not very important in a 20-year history of the press, but the  incident in the bus was significant enough  that both Sarah and I remember it with  anger.  Sincerely,  Jeannie Kamins,  Vancouver, BC  Response from  Sarah Davidson  I plead not guilty—except, perhaps, of  not recognizing people I had met before.  1972 and 1973 were years full of tension  and miscommunication between many men  and women. Lesbians were starting to be  public about our existence. It was a very  emotional time. Everyone's perceptions were  coming through a filter of the information  we had, or didn't have, assumptions about  other people and their motives, and all the  emotion that surrounded political and personal change in relation to feminism.  When I look back at those early years at  Press Gang, I am very grateful that the transition from a mixed left press with close ties  to many feminist causes, to a feminist  i-run press with close ties to many left  causes, was done with good will and a commitment to collective ideology. We experienced a period of intense discomfort but I  have heard of and seen too many other  political groups who were torn apart.  I think that this beginning left a legacy  that Press Gang continued—that disagreements have not blown the organization up.  Since I was interviewed for the article  about the early years at Press Gang, my  name was mentioned often, but no one else  was. I'd like to make one correction to the  article. As far as I had understood, the original Press Gang collective was Sylvia  Lindstrom, Dave Schraeder, Richard, and  Ed Shaw. Press Gang has always, as far as I  know, run as a collective and there have  been many dedicated people who worked  there. Each one has his or her own story.  Sincerely,  Sarah Davidson  Vancouver, BC  Self-selecting  identities  Kinesis:  The June issue of Kinesis had an article  about improving access to women's services  for deaf and hard of hearing women [at  Women Against Violence Against Women/  Rape Crisis Centre (WAVAW).]  It is very important to the Deaf community and for hard-of-hearing women that the  issue of identities be self-selected and distinct. Some women do not like the term  "hearing impaired" while others choose it as  the best way to describe their situation. I  wouldhopethatinall editorial roles, there is  a responsibility to check for accuracy and to  maintain the integrity of original submissions.  I would like to set the record straight for  readers that lama Deaf woman, not hard of  hearing, as stated in [the bioline at the bottom of the article], and I have never been and  am still not a member of the WAVAW collective. I was contracted by them as a consultant, only to provide support and advice  in the development of services for deaf and  hard of hearing women. I have finished the  contract and wish the project the best of luck.  I think it is important to remind readers  that identity is a very personal thing and  misuse of labels can affect both subjective  and objective perceptions.  For those interested, the new TTY line  for WAVAW can be reached at 254-6268.  The business line is still 255-6228 for voice  calls.

Mayworks ignores  single moms  Open letter to feminists:  Recently, Mayworks put on their annual "Festival of Working People and the  Arts." It seems that mothers and low-income people are not included in their definition of "working people," since this festival  did not provide childcare or, for most of  their events, a sliding-scale admission.  A more honest exa m ina tion of workers'  realities would show that mothers, especially low or zero-income single mothers,  are among the most exploited of workers.  We do hard physical labour starting at conception. We are educators, healers, janitors,  shortand long-order cooks, crisis managers,  scapegoats, fund-raisers, conflict resolvers  and more. We worka 24-hour day forno pay  and paid coffee breaks and lunch hours are  not included. We have to arrange our own  time off and usually have to pay for it. Often  our survival is dependent upon racist and  sexist institutions, such as the heterosexual  marriage, the welfare system, the judicial  system, or monies from often abusive male-  ex-partners. We are also put in the position  of exploiting other workers, often themselves poor—single mothers who do childcare at low rates for us because there is  almost never childcare or subsidies at event.  It is hypocritical for Mayworks to claim  an interest in workers' realities while they  perpetuate the oppression of us by not making events accessible.  Not providing a sliding-scale admission price for many Mayworks events made  this festival even more inaccessible. I am a  single mother of one young child, living on  welfare—living in poverty. My monthly entertainment budget is about $25. I cannot  afford to pay $10 on movies, and $20 on  childcare. When I and another poor single  mother went to one of the films and said we  could not afford to pay anything, Mayworks  organisers haggled the ticket price with us.  We know what we can afford—our entertainment budgets don't allow for haggling.  One Mayworks organizer responded to  my request for free admission by telling me  people have to show "respect" for how much  events cost and so should really try to pay as  much as they can. This is a classist remark  and the word "respect" in this context is  shaming and condescending. Poor people  are constantly subjugated, degraded and  constricted by "the cost of things". I am  aware things cost money: tha t's why I needed  to be let in at zero sliding-scale. I refuse to  buy fewer groceries becausea festival with a  budget higher thanmyyearlyincomedoesn't  offer a sliding scale.  Yes, it is important for performers and  artists to be paid for their work. But without  a sliding scale, money goes from one impoverished group toanother. Sliding-scale, based  on a wide price range, ensures equal access  to events. People who can afford to, pay a  high price; those who can afford less or  nothing, pay what they can. They should not  have to grovel or feel ashamed about their  contribution.  When an event is not accessible to people, it is an oppression of those people.  Mayworks showed films on issues of relevance to people of colour, dykes, mothers  and other women. It is racist, sexist, classist  and heterosexist (insulting and oppressive)  to not take concrete steps to ensure that the  most oppressed, and therefore often the most  impoverished in our capitalist society, have  access to their own images. Offering movies  of interest to them that they cannot afford to  attend is insulting and oppressive. I hope  that Mayworks will deal with these issues by  next year.  There are several other festivals that are  even more financially inaccessible and that  do not offer childcare. Single mothers have  little time for lobbying these events for accessibility. Non-parents have more time—it  would be real swell if they would use it to  unlearn and challenge the oppression of  mothers and other impoverished people by  writing letters like this, making phone calls,  and otherwise not tolerating our exclusion  at festival s, events, community and business  places.  On another note: at this year's Out on  Screen Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, several women formed an ad hoc committee to  solicit money from the audience for childcare subsidies. Our goal was to provide  access for low to zero-income parents to  attend the film festival which did not provide on-site childcare or childcare subsidies  On behalf of the Ad Hoc Childcare Subsidy Committee for Out on Screen, thank  you to all who contributed to the fund. It  made it a lot easier for a number of poor  mothers to enjoy the festival.  If you are a low or zero income parent  and found it difficult or impossible to pay  for your childcare for this festival, you can  still be subsidized for your childcare costs  for that event. Call 873-1810 by July 15.  Leftover money will be donated to the childcare fund of the Philippine Women's Centre.  Also, thanks very much to all who contributed to the childcare subsidy fund for the  International Women's Week Film Festival  at the Pacific Cinematheque in March.
