Women, men and  education in Canada:  a new study  Women and Men in Education is  the name of a recently-released national  survey of gender distribution in Canadian  school systems. Author Ruth Rees examines provincial departments and ministries  of eduction, teachers' associations and local school boards to see how job segregation  based on sex exists within education. She  has collected and set down data, province-  by-province, on the current state of female/male employment in our schools.  The survey also describes employment  equity programs, looks at hiring process,  and enumerates initiatives to encourage  women's skills and leadership development.  The report concludes with 23 solid, practical recommendations to increase the numbers of women in educational leadership positions and to reach employment equity, in  relation to female/male balance.  Published by the Canadian Education  Association, the survey costs $14 plus $3  handling (only for orders not pre-paid).

The Centre for Global  Issues and Women's  Leadership in the US  A Centre for Global Issues and Women's  Leadership opened in September 1989 at  Douglas College, Rutgers University in New  Jersey. Headed by Charlotte Bunch, the  Centre seeks to deepen understanding of  how gender affects the exercise of power  and conduct of public policy internationally. Its goals are: to develop ways of bringing women's perspectives and strategies into  greater visibility in public policy deliberations; to increase the participation and influence of women leaders in decision-making  roles, and to build international links among  women to enhance their effectiveness and  increase their global consciousness.  In May 1991, the first Women's Leadership Institute will bring together 30 participants (2/3 from outside the US) who are  taking leadership in the area of violence and  human rights. Participants may be policy  makers, public officials, activists or scholars.  Through creating a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, the Centre will  enable these women to compare, contrast  and learn from each other, as well as consider common strategies.  The Centre plans many other activities including research, documentation, the  development of study guides and public  outreach programs.

(There  was also a blast from the past in the form of  Libby Barlow, typewriter emeritus. Holy  Typo!)  It has been said that the feminist reading  world is divided into two solitary camps: the  murder/mayhem set and the sci-fi/fantasy  set. Sure, a few women are completely indiscriminate and will read anything, but  most of us know who we are and where we  fall. Melanie Conn has been Kinesis' window on the world of other worlds these past  four years, a faithful bearer of news from the  land of lurid covers and inspired visions.  For those who love sci-fi, Melanie's column has been a tip on what to buy (or  avoid) and a confirmation of how creative  and thought-provoking sci-fi writing can be.  And for those who prefer detection, Melanie  has been an excellent means of keeping  track of the other side without having to  read the stuff yourself.  This month's "In Other Worlds" (page  19) will be the last: Melanie has decided to  take a much-deserved break, something we  can certainly grok after four years. Goodbye, Melanie—and thank you for all the  weird and wonderful writing.  Marsha Arbour is also altering her relationship to Kinesis, by leaving the Editorial Board after many years of service.

KINESIS /////////////////^^^  ////////////////////^^^^  news  Abortion a crime:  Law will be challenged  by Susan O'Donnell  Abortion is once again a crime  in Canada. After a week of heated  debate, Ottawa MPs approved Bill  C-43—a bill which makes doctors  who perform abortions, and possibly the women who seek them out,  guilty of a criminal offence and liable for up to two years imprisonment, unless they believe that the  health or life of the woman would  be likely to be threatened without  the abortion.  Reaction to the bill's approval  on May 29 was swift and strong.  "We will wage a short and bitter  fight, fueled by years of oppression," promised Joy Thompson of  the BC Coalition of Abortion Clinics. "It won't take another 20 years  to defeat this one." C-43 passed by  a vote of 140 to 131, and is expected to pass quickly in the Senate and become law.  "We will be more militant than  we have been in the past. We will  encourage health care professionals to defy the law, open clinics,  protect and defend women who are  prosecuted, and hold the Tories accountable for their lack of responsibility to the Canadian majority,"  said Thompson.  The BC Coalition of Abortion  Clinics has experienced "a 150  percent increase in membership"  since Vancouver's Everywoman's  Health Centre was opened in  November 1988. Thompson expects the clinic to be the site of  intense backlash by anti-abortionists. Her "worst-case scenario" is  a woman put on the stand to reveal her most private thoughts and  fears, under threat of incarceration. The woman's mental health  will be on trial; she will be accused by a revengeful husband  or boyfriend recruited by anti-  abortion groups.  While she sees the bill's passage as "a defeat and a betrayal,"  Thompson also feels a sense of victory. "Although it is a massive  step back, we are further ahead  than we were in 1988." In January  of that year, the Supreme Court  of Canada struck down the country's abortion law following a challenge by Dr. Henry Morgantaler.  Canada had been without federal  legislation on abortion until the  May 29 vote.  Reaction across the country by  pro-choice advocates is expected  to be as militant as the BC coalition's. Quebec groups said they  will openly defy the new law. "We  defy the authorities, who refuse  to recognize that abortion is a  woman's choice, to take action  against us," said Ginette Bastien  of the Regroupement des centres  de saute' des femmes. "We will  fight this unnecessary and unjust law in the courts and in the  streets."  Court of Canada, but pro-choice  activists fear the new legislation  will prompt a new rash of similar  interventions.  A casket full of hangers.  Vancouver protests the abortion law  on May 12, 1990.  Quebec has strong public support for the pro-choice position.  About 10,000 people marched  through Montreal last summer in  support of Chantal Daigle's court  fight with her ex-boyfriend, who  tried to block Daigle from having  an abortion. His case was upheld  by a lower court and the Quebec  Supreme Court.

Campbell believes that  since the provinces hold the constitutional authority over health  care, the federal government must  use the Criminal Code to override  At the end of May, women's centres in British Columbia have yet  to receive the operational funding  that was restored to them after  a successful fight-back campaign  that began in late February.  As a result, centres are still  struggling to stay open and some  will likely remain closed: while  the cheques may now be in the  mail, nearly three months without  money will simply prove too harsh.  The federal Secretary of State  Women's Program started processing the centres' 1990-91 applications for core funding as soon as  Mary Collins, federal Minister Responsible for the Status of Women,  made her May 4 announcement  that $1.2 million would be restored to women's centres across  the country.  Feminists responded publicly to  the announcement with qualified  approval and privately with elation: the Conservative's reversal of  its cut to women's centres was only  the second time in six years that  popular pressure forced the government to retreat from an unpopular measure.  The first time was when senior citizens successfully fought  the de-indexing of their pensions,  a victory which proved temporary.  The restoration of women's centres funding is also temporary and  worse still, represents only a portion of what women across the  country are demanding for the  Secretary of State's Women's Program.  In the wake of the funding cuts,  women's organizations across the  country forged an ad-hoc committee and developed the following  proposal, which was forwarded to  Secretary of State Gerry Weiner  on AprU 30th. The Tories were  urged to:  * continue the Women's Program as a funding body which provides operational funding to national and regional women's programs;  * reinstate all funding cut from  the program since 1989, ($3.6 million in total);  * commit itself to negotiate permanent cost-sharing agreements  with the provinces and territories  for women's centres and, in the  event that negotiations are unsuccessful, to continue on-going funding;  * increase funding for women's  groups, particularly to groups representing Native women, immigrant women, women of colour and  women with disabilities;  restore Women's Program  funding but not at the expense of  other groups affected by cutbacks,  such as Native groups, and to enter into negotiations with those  groups immediately;  * drop all outstanding criminal charges against people arrested  during peaceful protests at Secretary of State offices in Newfoundland.  This proposal is in sharp contrast to the Tories' concession of  a year's worth of core funding  for centres only. No money has  been restored to the other feminist  groups cut in the February budget (publications, advocacy and  research groups) and women's centres are facing a vacuum when the  next fiscal year rolls around.  The ad-hoc committee, consisting of representatives from national groups and women's centres  in BC, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, the Yukon and Quebec, has  recently reiterated its demands to  Weiner and has asked him to respond by June 8th.  Negotiating with women's representatives has not been Weiner's  strong suit and there is little reason to believe he will change.  In mid-May, his office contacted  the BC and Yukon Association  of Women's Centres (BCYAWC)  with the message that "the minis  ter is a very busy man" and issues  should be dealt with regionally.  In BC, the question of who  will provide future core funding to  women's centres is up in the air.  The provincial government, which  initially declared its willingness to  provide half of the 1990-91 funds  but quickly withdrew the offer after negotiations with Ottawa, has  said nothing more on the matter  of core funding.  Carol Gran, provincial Minister Responsible for Women's Programs, is awaiting the recommendations of her advisory committee (see Kinesis May, 1990) which  will report to her the second  week of June. According to Robin  LeDrew, BCYAWC's representative on the advisory committee,  there is unlikely to be any recommendation for core funding to  women's centres.  At its Annual General Meeting  at the end of May, the BCYAWC  instructed LeDrew to use her position on the advisory committee  to call for core funding and/or a  cost-sharing arrangement between  the federal and province governments. In conversation with Kinesis, LeDrew expressed an unwillingness to take that position,  based on her belief that there was  no support for core funding of  women's centres on Gran's committee.  the provinces on the abortion issue.  "I'm somewhat concerned that  some of the criticisms of the bill  from people who share my perspective on the issue are somewhat  naive in terms of how the law actually works. I think one positive  aspect of the bill for people who  approach it from my perspective is  the contribution to the legislative  framework," Campbell has said.  She has stated she is pro-choice.  Her legal reasoning came under sharp attack by law experts  across the country. The National  Association of Women in the Law  (NAWL) released a report in  which 17 law school professors said  the federal government is wrong in  claiming that the legislation will  • stop provinces from passing their  own restrictive laws. Only one aca-  ■ demic supported Justice Minister Campbell's contention that the  bill will "occupy the field" of criminal law and prevent provinces from  taking their own action.  The legal academics' criticisms  of Campbell's position are harsh.  Some are almost contemptuous in  analyzing the government's position, calling the Tories' legal rationales "surprisingly uninformed  ... legal nonsense," and "simply  wrong." The NAWL report concludes that the government's main  rationale for recriminalizing abortion is unfounded. NAWL plans  an immediate constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court when  the bill becomes law.  Other women's advocacy groups  were unanimous in their criticism  of C-43. The Women's Legal Action and Education Fund (LEAF)  believes the legislation violates the  Charter of Rights for three rear  sons. First, because it singles out  a medical procedure that only  women require and tells women  that they may be subject to criminal sanction for seeking treatment  in circumstances other than narrowly defined by the law; second,  because it tells women that they  are not competent to make final  and binding decisions about their  reproductive capacities; and third,  because it will lead to disparities  between provinces in terms of access to medical and safe abortions.  The Canadian Abortion Rights  Action League (CARAL) stresses  that C-43 does nothing to prevent provincial restrictions, or remove existing restrictions, on access to abortion. They say the law  will cause access to deteriorate by  further intimidating doctors, especially in smaller centres. The new  law will deny some abortions and  delay others, and it negates the  fact that a woman's mental health  is endangered if she is refused an  abortion that she wants.  Both the National Action Committee on the Status of Women  (NAC) and the Canadian Advisory Committee on the Status of  Women say that abortion should  be a matter of health policy, not  criminal law. They believe the  Canada Health Act should be  amended to respect the equality  provisions under the Charter, and  see Abortion page 4  KINESIS NEWS  Call for changes  to adoption  records bill  by Millie Strom  "A part of you is missing," says  Susan Davenport about her search  for the daughter she relinquished  to adoption many years ago. Davenport, now married with two children adds, "Motherhood is unique;  you can't pretend it didn't happen." Another birthmother, Barbara Simpson, says, "Women are  talking about rights—but they've  been taken away from the birthmother."  These birthmothers and over 40  others, including adoptees, demonstrated on the steps of the legislature in Victoria on Mother's  Day. They claim the present legislation of closed records is unfair.  Open records—when the adoptee  reaches the age of majority—could  help birthmothers and adoptees  and their siblings to know each  other.  Birthmothers and adoptees may  register with the BC registry for  non-identifying information such  as social and religious background.  H both parties are registered, identifying information will be exchanged. But there can be up to  a two year wait in some provinces,  and the registry is not advertised  so many are unaware of this service.  Searchers say they turn to private organizations such as Parent Finders, CARA (Canadian  Adoptees Reform Association) and  Missing  Pieces  Through  Adop  tion for assistance in their own  searches.  But searching can be tedious  and frustrating. Val Turner, an  adoptee, completed her search after eight years. "Five of those  years I was searching in the wrong  province," she said.  Demonstrators held signs with  slogans such as, "Birthmothers  Never Forget," and "Adoption: A  Life of Not Knowing." Aaron Davenport, 11-year-old son of Susan,  carried a sign that read: "Where is  my sister?" Other members of the  family can also be affected by the  closed system. Currently, grandparents and siblings of the adopted  person are not allowed to register.  Audrey Scammell, president of  the Victoria chapter of TRIAD  (Truth in Adoption) hopes that  BC will go one step further than  the provinces (Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec) that do searches  for adoptees. (There is up to an  eight year wait for these services.)  TRIAD is aiming for BC to open  the records like New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii. For those wishing to remain anonymous, Scammell says, "H either party is opposed to this, they may veto it, renewing [the veto] every five years."  Scammell, an adoptive parent  who searched over seven years  for her son's birthmother, finds  that many adoptive parents are  for open records. "We realize the  importance of knowing where you  came from."  CARA, on the other hand, believes the records should only be  open to the adoptee. They believe  that to deny adult adoptees their  own birth records for knowledge of  their heritage is to deny them a basic human right. Time is overdue  to change the archaic and discriminatory laws in Canada. CARA  representative and adoptee Linda  McDonald explains, "The adoptee  never had any say, and therefore,  it should be their decision."  Birthmother Jane Johnston, an  obstetric nurse, told of her frustration when talking with a staff person at the Alberta registry. "She  held my file in her hands, but was  unable to reveal the information. I  vacillated between kissing her feet  and holding a gun to her head.  Adoptees are not cabbage-patch  kids, they have a right to know."  And Jennifer Mazeppa, both an  adoptee and birthmother, says she  knows the pain at both ends. "I  want my daughter to be able to  know me, and I want to be able to  find my birthfather."  Currently, 759 adoptees and 644  parents are registered in B.C.  There have been 31 matches since  the registry opened in 1988, according to TRIAD.  The rainy day Mother's Day  demonstration brought a reunion  for Sherry Hartland and her  brother Joshua Gavel. It was a  happy day for Gavel—he had lived  in 32 foster homes before he was  16 years old.  If you have something  to say on repro tech...  by Bonnie Waterstone  "The implications of new reproductive technologies for women's  reproductive health are enormous," said Catherine Martel,  who has taken charge of forging  a network between Lower Mainland groups preparing briefe for  the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technology.  "As women it is vitally important that we attend to the development and use of new reproductive technologies," Martel stated.  With her background in philosophy and ethical theory, Martel is  particularly interested in decisions  that reinforce the best interest of  the women involved. At present,  doctors, scientists and lawyers, not  women themselves, are making decisions about new reproductive  technologies.  The Royal Commission offers an  opportunity for women to provide  input   into  the   decision-making  process. Public hearings will be  held across Canada beginning in  September 1990. To be invited to  appear, a group or individual must  submit a short brief by July 31,  1990. The commission is interested  in submissions as diverse as research papers and personal accounts.  Martel is calling on groups and  individuals throughout the Lower  Mainland to come together to  share information and ideas.  "I see my role as a liaison  person for those who intend to  present briefs before the commission. [Through these meetings], we  can ensure communication and the  exchange of information for optimum effectiveness."  The initial meeting is June  6, 6:30 pm, at the Vancouver Status of Women (#301  1720 Grant St). All those interested in preparing briefs for the  Royal Commission are encouraged to attend. Further meetings will be set at that time,  to allow for more networking  as the July 31 deadline approaches. For more information, telephone 255-5511.  Handmaids? Never!  Three Handmaids (Ofbrian, Ofmichael and Ofgerry) and their supporters travelled from government office to government office in  Vancouver on May 4, delivering a set of demands protesting the  funding cuts to the Women's Program. The Handmaids, in their  brilliant red robes, were inspired by Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.  Abortion from page 3  that the Act should be enforced  to ensure universal access to safe  abortions across the country.  During the five months of intense lobbying of MPs since C-  43 was introduced to the House  in October 1989, pro-choice advocates found themselves in the unusual position of having the same  message as anti-abortionists: "Defeat the Bill." Kit Holmwood of  CARAL said: "In this case, it's  two very strange bedfellows."  Pro-choice supporters believe  abortion is a health matter and  does not belong in the Criminal  Code. Anti-abortionists say the  bill is not restrictive enough and  allows abortion on demand. Both  groups had organized protests in  cities across the country in their  bid to gather public support to  have the bill defeated.  In Vancouver, the latest demonstration occurred just days before  the vote. About 200 pro-choice  protesters marched outside Campbell's office May 25. They had  tried to enter her office but found a  locked door, despite it being a regular working day. About a dozen  activists moved into the building  lobby but were later escorted out  by police. No arrests were made.  Despite the protests, Bill C-43  passed with a slim majority vote.  The voting procedure has been described as a "free vote," one in  which MPs from both sides of the  House vote according to their consciences and not to their party affiliation, but many observers say  the Tories did everything possible  to ensure the bill would pass.  The parliamentary committee  hearings during the months before  the third and final reading of Bill  C-43 were "a farce," said Leslie  Pearl of NAWL. "Forty-six out of  the 52 presenters opposed the bill,  but not one amendment was allowed," she said. "Some of the  MPs and public have been fooled  into thinking this bill will do something positive for women."  During the week preceding the  May 29 vote, not one of the proposed amendments to the bill was  passed. Mulroney, Campbell, and  Health Minister Beatty all said  they would not accept any proposals for changes. One of the rejected proposals would have reduced the chances of third-party  intervention, such as the one made  in the Chantal Daigle case.  "There was no free vote," involved in the earlier readings or  the procedure to amend the Bill,  and there will not be one during the final vote itself, said  MP Dawn Black (NDP Women's  Critic). "The Prime Minister and  his colleagues stood up in a line at  the front of the house and voted  for it," Black said. Mulroney instructed cabinet members to support the bill.  MP Black introduced a pro-  choice amendment that was supported by only five Liberals  and two Progressive Conservatives, none of whom were women.  The NDP MP said that as her  amendment had no hope of passing, a vote in support would have  only been a symbolic one. Mary  Collins, the Minister Responsible  for the Status of Women, voted  against the pro-choice amendment.  Black, reached by Kinesis at  her home the weekend before the  May 29 vote, said the previous  week had been a very intense  time of little sleep. "Any remaining illusions I had of the possibility of women MPs pulling together across party lines were shot  down," she said.  KINESIS NEWS  x^^^^^^^^^^^^^  AIDS Project  =jl—11—is=3r—w—1/ im—r—ii—innnr*  First of  its kind  in Canada  by Joni Miller  Canada's first federally funded Women  and AIDS project opened its doors in Vancouver the same week the BC government  began a highly public pursuit of a young  HIV-positive prostitute.  "We got virtually no coverage of the  opening," says Robin Barnett, one of two  staff at the project. "The press already had  their AIDS story."  For women, it is  particularly difficult to  get a diagnosis.  The Women and AIDS project was developed by a group of women who met through  AIDS Vancouver. Its focus is mainly education. Barnett particularly wants to get  through to feminists who work with women  in counselling situations, or community  groups.  "Women don't think they are at risk [for  AIDS]," she says, "they need to know that  AIDS is a real danger."  Renee, the young woman prostitute, was  suspected of having unprotected intercourse  with customers. Victoria medical health of  ficer Dr. Shaun Peck used the Communicable Diseases Act to issue an order to confine  the woman to Victoria's Royal Jubilee Hospital. She has since been taken into custody  in Lethbridge, Alberta. It was the first time  the "Quarantine" bill was used against an  HIV carrier. This legislation was protested  by gay and women's groups when it was first  drafted.  "Prostitutes have historically been  blamed for sexually transmissable diseases,"  says Barnett, "but I'm not aware of a documented case of someone getting HIV from  a prostitute."  North American men who are HIV-  positive usually become infected through  sex with other men or sharing needles. HIV  is the virus believed responsible for AIDS.  The majority of women with AIDS get  the disease from their husbands or male sexual partners. Barnett estimates there are 2-  300 HIV-positive women in BC, mostly in  the Lower Mainland. They are mainly suburban women with bisexual or hemophiliac husbands, and young streetwomen. Most  will die without ever being in contact with  each other. Unlike men, who are mostly  from the gay community, women with AIDS  are not a cohesive group.  "Nobody has become public," says Mylo  Riley, who facilitates a drop-in group for  HIV-positive women. "It's frightening just  for them to come here." Riley says that  women with AIDS are usually not 'out'  beyond their immediate family. They are  frightened by the stigma of the  "They can't talk about what they're going through anywhere else. They come here  looking for understanding."  The drop-in group has been operating  since March 1990. HIV-positive women arrive through word-of-mouth referrals, STD  clinics or the Persons With AIDS coalition.  "Lots of people are HIV infected and  don't know it," Barnett says. "They may  not look any different than anyone else."  For women, it is particularly difficult to  get a diagnosis. "Doctors don't look for it  in women." Barnett believes women have  died of AIDS without being diagnosed and  that statistics have been further distorted  by 'fudged' death certificates.  Although there have been documented  cases of women with AIDS in North Amer-  Supreme Court ruling  In women's self-defense  by Tarel Quandt  Feminists are praising a recent Supreme  Court of Canada decision that broadened the legal understanding of self-defense  in upholding the acquittal of a battered  woman who killed her common-law husband.  The unanimous decision, written by  Madam Justice Bertha Wilson and rendered  May 3, involved the case of Lyn Lavallee  and Kevin Rust. Lavallee fatally shot Rust  on August 30, 1986 after a four-year relationship in which he had relentlessly battered her. During a party at their home that  evening, Rust had told Lavalee she was going to "get it" after their guests left. Fearing  for her Hfe, Lavallee shot him in the back of  the head with a shotgun he had handed her.  Lavallee was initially acquitted by a Manitoba jury on the charge of second-degree  murder. In 1988, the Manitoba appeal court  struck down the jury's decision and ordered  a new trial. The appeal court objected to  the use of the "expert" testimony of psychiatrist Fred Shane, a defense witness who  testified to Lavallee's state of mind during  her relationship with Rust. Traditionally,  jurors are expected to base their decision on  how they believe an "ordinary man" (sic)  will respond under the circumstances.  Drawing on the research of Dr. Lenore  Walker (author of The Battered Woman  Syndrome), Shane had testified that like  other battered women, Lavallee had experienced helplessness, isolation and depression as a result of living in constant fear.  Trapped in this cycle of violence, women in  Lavallee's position are often only able to respond in desperate ways when the danger  escalates to fatal proportions.  The Supreme Court rejected the appeal's  court argument—and the "ordinary man"  convention—and ruled that experts are indeed needed to explain the battered wife  syndrome, at least in part to offset the entrenched social values which sanction violence against women. As Madam Wilson  wrote, "It is difficult for a lay person to comprehend [this syndrome]. It is commonly  thought that battered women are not really beaten as badly as they claim, otherwise they would have left the relationship.  Alternatively, some believe that women enjoy being beaten..."  The court found that the battering relationship is subject to a large group of myths  and stereotypes and as such, is "beyond the  ken of the average juror."  The court also found that a battered  woman knows best when a fatal attack may  occur and should not have to be in "imminent peril" before she can successfully plead  self-defense. The court accepted Lavallee's  perception that she was in a life-threatening  situation.  "Laws historically have been set for men  when they need to defend themselves,"  said Colleen Smith, a worker at Vancouver's Women Against Violence Against  Women Sexual Assault Centre. "Now the  law is more equal in its application. Self-  defense is being redefined to suit women's  needs." Smith said the decision acknowledges Lavallee's actions as reasonable, given  her experiences.  Gail Edinger of Battered Women's Support Services believes the court's judgment publicly legitimizes women's experiences by addressing common myths about  wife abuse. She points out that the ruling  sets a precendent for educating juries on  matters often not understood by them during wife assault trials.  Lawyer Megan Ellis believes the decision illustrates how social attitudes have  changed in Canada, noting that the courts  are merely following, not making, the  changes. She credits' the judgement to the  efforts of the women who work on issue of  wife battery. Ellis notes that the Supreme  Court's recognition of women's reality will  probably "filter down" and affect judges of  other courts.  The myth that battered women are either  liars or masochists has been challenged by  this verdict. Feminists' answer to the question "why doesn't she leave?" has finally  been embraced by the highest court.  ica smce 1983, it is only in the last few  years that attention has been focused on  women. Evidence suggests the disease takes  a faster course in women than in men, but  Barnett says there are other factors" to consider. Most of the women studied have been  women of colour in the US who are IV drug  users and living in poverty.  "It's uncertain whether the difference is  AIDS or poverty," Barnett says. "Usually  these women don't get medical care until after they've taken care of everyone else. The  disease may be very advanced by then." She  also pointed to inadequate nutrition and inadequate medical care.  Currently, most male AIDS patients in  Vancouver end up at St. Paul's Hospital.  Barnett says women are afraid to go to St.  Paul's. "They don't want to be labelled,"  she says.  St. Paul's is a Catholic hospital, which  poses another problem for women.  "Pregnant women who are HIV-positive  have a 30 percent chance of passing the  disease on to their babies," Barnett says.  "They need unbiased counselling and some  need abortion care."  A group of women health care workers  have asked for funding for a separate centre for women, but unless the numbers of  HIV positive women increase, this is unlikely to be established. Another overlooked  area is support for mothers of AIDS sufferers, many of whom become primary caretakers.  The Women and AIDS project has a  large collection of pamphlets from all over  the US and Canada, but Barnett considers  most of them junk. "They either use fear  or don't give useful instructions," she says.  The project is working to develop their own  materials.  Barnett considers it imperative that  women learn assertiveness in sexual relationships. She says most assertiveness  training courses don't deal with sexuality.  Women who are trying to practise safe sex  may be threatened with violence or other  repercussions if they insist that men use  condoms.  Women with AIDS have been an invisible  group, but AIDS organizations are working  to change that. This year World AIDS Day  (December 1) will focus on women. Vancouver activities will include a panel (sponsored  by Oxfam Global Health) featuring women  from Zambia and Thailand—two countries  with high numbers of women with AIDS.  KINESIS  June 90 5 /SSSSSSSSSfSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SS/S/S//SSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SSSSSS///SSSSSSS/S77?  //////////////////^^^^^  Across Canada  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Linda Choquette  Doctors regularly  mess up low-risk  births, says survey  Doctors regularly and unnecessarily intervene in low-risk childbirth, according to  a University of Toronto study. The research  involved 2,500 women and says that obstetricians intruded in 45 percent of low-risk  deliveries. Interventions by family doctors  in low-risk deliveries occured 32 percent of  the time. Both groups had a 10 percent caesarean section rate. Interventions do not result in healthier babies, the study found.  Procedures surveyed included induction  of labour, artificial rupture of membranes,  epidural anesthesia, episiotomy and the use  of low forceps and vacuum extraction.  Two conflicting trends in obstetric care  are emerging, says the report's author Dr.  Anthony Reid. One is the use of more high-  technology in an attempt to ensure the best  outcome. The other is towards less use of  technology to humanize childbirth.  The report recommended low-risk women  have their babies delivered by family doctors. "I would like to see family doctors who  do not deliver refer their patients to family doctors who do or to midwives. Low-risk  deliveries should be done by low-risk care  givers," said Reid.  Court decision  misreads the effects  of coercion  Laura Norberg, denied the right to sue  in BC because of her "immoral" conduct, is  now seeking to appeal to the Supreme Court  of Canada. In 1987, Norberg tried to sue her  doctor Morris Wynrib, who had demanded  sex in exchange for drug prescriptions, but  the BC Supreme Court used a principle that  states those involved in illegal or immoral  activities have no redress under the law. In  its decision, the court referred to an 1878  case of a servant who was also denied the  right to sue after her employer infected her  and her infant with syphilis.  The decision was then upheld in the BC  Court of Appeal in 1988. Chief Justice Allen  McEachern said Norberg could not claim  sexual assault as a result of the 12 or so  incidents because she went to the doctor's  apartment voluntarily in order to get drugs.  He said they were jointly involved in illegal  drug trafficking and that the trial judge was  right to refuse damages.  Lynn Smith, University of BC law professor and current chairperson of the Women's  Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF),  said Norberg's case is "very significant, because of what it says about the law of consent relating to women."  "There are many ways coercion can take  place outside physical force," Smith said.  LEAF will seek to intervene in the case  if the Supreme Court agrees to hear it.  Norberg became addicted to the barbiturate Fiorinal after doctors prescribed  the narcotic painkiller for her headaches.  The doctors missed the source of Norberg's  pain—an infected tooth.  The case came to public attention in  April through an article written for The  Verdict, the magazine of the BC Trial  Lawyers Association. The article's author,  Provincial Court Judge C.C. Barnett, condemned the appeal court decision and said,  unless it is reversed, doctors who prey on  patients can all breath easier.  Living near Williams Lake with her two  children, Norberg says she has been rejected  by some family members and humiliated in  her home town as a result of her efforts to  sue the doctor.  "He took advantage of the fact that I was  an addict and I was desperate," she said.  "When it came out in my paper here, it was  like I had taken advantage of this lonely old  P4W condemned  in yet another  damning report  Eighty-two percent of the 240 inmates  of the Kingston Prison for Women have  suffered physical or sexual abuse at some  time in their lives. In a report released in  April, the most recent task force enquiry  into Canada's only penitentiary for women  (P4W) said the prison system must recognize that women who have been abused  need treatment not isolation in a centralized, archaic prison.  There is a groundswell of consensus that  fundamental reform in the treatment of  women who commit crimes is urgently  needed. "The time to act is now," the report said.  Among the task force criticisms of P4W  were the separation of women from their  children and family support, inadequate  health care and little or no opportunity to  receive psychological counselling or addiction treatment. The report recognized the  particular cultural and spiritual isolation  experienced by aboriginal women.  P4W is a maximum security institution  which means that as a punitive measure,  programs and recreation activities are reduced. As P4W is the only federal prison  for women, all inmates suffer this deprivation regardless of their status as low or high  risk according to correctional standards.  Recommending that P4W be closed, the  task force proposes the construction of five  regional prisons. Cottage-like units, able to  accomodate children, would house up to 10  women in each.  "P4W is like a torture chamber," said  Bonnie Diamond, executive director of the  Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, and co-chairperson of the task force. A  punitive environment can only worsen psychological problems, she said.  "We don't take people who have been  hurt—often from childhood—and treat  them violently hoping they'll emerge corrected," said Diamond.  Since its opening in 1934, nine major  commissions or task forces have asked the  government to close P4W.  Quebec anniversary  marked by  charges of racism  Recent celebrations to mark the 50th  anniversay of provincial suffrage for some  Quebec women were denounced as elitist  and racist. The official celebrations, funded  by the province and held late in April,  were boycotted by groups who accused the  organizers—especially Lise Payette, honorary chairperson—of bigotry.  "These women talk about solidarity of  women, but their solidarity is exclusive,  it doesn't include all women in Quebec,"  said Fatima Houda-Pepin, president of a  province- wide network of cultural groups.  Helene Wavroch, a spokeswoman for an  anti-racism group, said the celebrations fail  to mention that only white women got the  right to vote 50 years ago. The vote came  later for Japanese-Canadian and Chinese-  Canadian women, and Native women had  to wait until 1969.  Aoura Bizzarri, co-ordinator of the Col-  lectif des femmes immigrantes du Quebec  said the choice of Lise Payette as honorary  chairperson for the celebrations was an insult. Payette, a television host and former  Parti Quebecois politician, produced a tv  program Disparaitre which portrayed immigrants as a threat to Quebec culture.  Marie Lavigne, president of the provincial Status of Women Council called the divisions unfortunate but said they should not  take away from the fight for equality for all  women.  Education, not  technology, the key  to end infertility  A report on infertility, released mid-May,  says the key to helping women have babies is  education not technology. According to the  report, too much money is spent on fancy  technical fixes to infertility and too little is  devoted to basic reproductive health promotion.  The study, prepared for the Canadian  Advisory Council on the Status of Women  (CACSW), was conducted by Heather  Bryant of the University of Calgary's faculty of medicine.  The desperation of childless couples has  focussed resources on high-tech infertility  "cures", often experimental and unsuccessful, the report said. For example, the in  vitro procedure cost millions to develop,  and costs thousands each time it is tried, yet  its success rate is only about 15 percent.  Girls should be made aware of the risk  of becoming infertile because of sexually  transmitted diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease. Risk  of these diseases can be reduced with condom use.  Glenda Sims, CACSW president, refers  to the lack of basic health education as the  real issue of infertility. The focus should  be on women, not on the pharmaceutical  industry, high technology and the medical  profession.  "It is women's bodies that are at risk in  this whole question," Simms said.  The study adds that sexual abuse of children is a contributing factor to infertility.  There is an increasing incidence of gonorrhea among infants and toddlers aged one  to four, and girls aged ten to fourteen.  The report will go to the federal royal  commission on reproductive technologic  How the classroom  reflects imbalance  between women,  men  There are few women principals in Canadian secondary schools. Across the country,  the presence of women in the top school job  never exceeds twelve percent. In BC, one  in twenty-five principals is a woman: in Alberta, one in thirty. Ontario has one in nine,  Quebec, one in eight, and PEI has none. The  survey which produced facts about elementary and secondary schools was prepared for  the Canadian Education Association.  The report's author, Dr. Ruth Rees, a  Queen's University professor says the report will not surprise anyone. She says it  supports common knowledge that men run  the school systems and women are the front  line workers. The study is the first, however,  to break down gender imbalance in education province by province, job-by-job and  will likely become the benchmark to measure progress in employment equity.  Rees believes that at least 50 percent of  principals in elementary schools should be  female. "If at the level of elementary school,  where the ratio of teachers by gender are,  let's say, 75-25 women to men, then fair  representation may be considered to be obtained when 75 percent of the principalships  are occupied by women," she said.  That the vast majority of elementary  school teachers are women, while the majority of elementary school principals are men  is disturbing, says Rees, because it reinforces the perception that elementary school  teaching is women's work.

Alliance for Life, a coalition of anti-abortion  groups, is at least one group using either  newly legalized technology to identify phone  numbers as soon as a call is received or later,  are getting phone numbers from computer  print-outs. The printouts tell them what  number peopled called from to their 1-800  toll-free line.  Within a week of first contact, AFL  makes a follow-up call—in my case, a  woman called me by my first name while  leaving a message on my answering machine. She asked me to call the 1-800 number during office hours.  My first contact with AFL was in early  May. The number I called was publicized  during a late-night paid hour TV spot  aimed directly at pregnant teenagers. I  phoned during the broadcast without identifying myself I wasn't rude: the only thing  I said to the counsellor was: "I think your  approach to abortion is simplistic and sanctimonious." She thanked me and we both  hung up.  Alliance for Life denies making automatic  follow-up calls to everyone who calls. When  the group, based in Winnipeg, was asked  about my particular incident they claimed  I'd called before they initiated their call to  me. They say, completely erroneously, that  I left my phone number and area code on a  second call.  Spokeswoman Anna Desilets says unless  a caller leaves a phone number, they will  not—even in suspected "crisis pregnancy  situations"—make a follow-up call.  I did make a second call—but only upon  receiving their follow- up. And I foolishly  closed the book by leaving a message on  their night message machine: "I don't share  your views, I'm not pleased you have my  number and don't bother calling me again."  The frightening thing is how easy it is to  trace someone when you have their phone  number. Phone companies publish directories with phone numbers listed numerically,  followed by subscribers' names. City directories also list phone numbers and street addresses first to help you find people. I used  that method to find AFL in Winnipeg.  AFL admits they eventually receive  print-outs telling them where calls originated. So whether or not they can tell right  away matters little. The fact remains, no  matter what—by the end of a billing period,  calls are definitely not confidential.  Young women's stories no longer belong  to them and them alone. The print-outs provided as a service to 1-800 numbers remove  any potential confidentiality. One to four  weeks after the call it still remains worthwhile for an anti-abortion group to attempt  to stop an abortion.  The TV show itself is smarmy. It suggests  that pregnant teens should either become a  single mom (with the loving help of their  family), marry a nice guy or give the child  up for adoption and make everyone happy.  Music interludes hint abortion is a choice  forced on women: "I'll take it on my own  now, with you I'm not alone now, you're  life is living inside. We'll make it somehow  baby, somehow. We will never give in, no  I'll never give in." And later: "The choice  you've made to do your best is a triumph  over wrong."  Actor Michael Gross, who played the father on Family Ties, shows up to offer  kindly advice and fundamentalist talk show  host David Mainse of 100 Huntley Street  makes an appearance to give full support  and sponsorship.  At least once during the hour-long TV  commercial callers are promised they will  receive complete confidentiality—no men-  Same-sex benefits  tion that a member of the organization will  follow up later and leave a message if necessary.  Imagine trying to explain to your parents  why you're supposed to return a call to a  1-800 number, or why the people who answer the phone say "Heartbeat: may I help  you?" And certainly, no mention is made  during their TV special that they have the  ability to find you and learn your address  and name with only a little simple research  once they have your phone number.  Both the Canadian Radio and Television  Commission (CRTC) and BC Telephone say  the practice to immediately identify callers  is not illegal. The CRTC approved the tech  nology very recently and says it's up to loca  phone companies to regulate how their subscribers use the system.-BC Tel says they  do not yet have the equipment to accomodate the phones, but it's approved and it's  coming.  The fact that anti-choice groups now  have legal access to equipment previously  allowed only to police and government agencies should scare the hell out of us. The fact  that calls to 1-800 numbers are not anony  mous should be made public.  Anti-abortion activists can choose to  pressure pregnant women by continually  phoning or going to a woman's home  Boyfriends, husbands and parents can be  recruited in the effort to prevent a woman  from making her own choice. Files on  trouble-makers like me can be compiled anc  used in any number of ways. It is not paranoid to have these fears—for one, why die  they call me, what did they want?  Anti-choice activists have proven themselves entirely capable of illegal and sometimes dangerous zealotry over and over  again. The ammunition of having our phone  numbers, addresses and names is a temptation few of them could resist.  Victories and a way to go  by Judy Lynne  The Lesbian and Gay Benefits Committee (LGBC) organizes around the provision  of employee benefit coverage for same-sex  partners.  Recent success in achieving benefit coverage for same-gender partners at the University of BC (UBC) has triggered a similar  victory at Simon Fraser University (SFU).  Professor Mary Bryson's efforts to compel  UBC to provide the same medical and dental coverage to her woman lover as they  do opposite-sex partners ended in January,  1990 after a six month struggle.  Bryson teaches in the Education Department, and her campaign for benefits coverage exposed her to intense scrutiny by the  mainstream media (who then failed to cover  the story) and homophobia from students  and other staff at the university. Now, the  struggle has moved to lobbying the UBC administration to effectively advertise the new  policy so lesbians and gays can actually access the benefits.  Ron Ramsey, manager of Benefits and  Pensions at SFU reports, "UBC having  done it, SFU couldn't see any reason why  we shouldn't." As yet, no SFU staff has applied for benefits, but the communication  process is just underway and Ramsey stated  the policy will be publicized.  It's worth emphasizing that, without  provincial legislative change, it is impossible at this time for carriers to provide basic medical coverage (Medical Services Plan,  MSP coverage) to lesbian or gay partners.  British Columbia does not include sexual  orientation as grounds to not discriminate  in the Human Rights Code. As well, the  current definition of "spouse" clearly describes only "a member of the opposite sex."  Since MSP is a provincially-administered  plan, there is little likelihood we will see  any changes to advance the rights of lesbians and gays while the Social Credit government remains in office.  Advances are being made, however, in  the unionized workforce. Those changes primarily affect negotiated benefits such as  bereavement leave, dental plans, extended  medical plans, pension plans, parental and  adoption leave, family tuition fees, etc. The  absence of MSP coverage distorts what are  otherwise encouraging, although isolated,  gains for lesbian and gay employees.  One way for a progressive employer to  put their money where their mouth is and  ensure that their gay workers' partners receive identical treatment as the partners of  heterosexual workers, is by paying the extra MSP premium themselves. Recently, the  Vancouver Municipal and Regional Employees Union (VMREU) found some willingness on the part of the Vancouver School  Board (VSB) to do just that. The VSB had  agreed to make such arrangements on behalf of one employee who applied but has  since submitted her resignation.  In contract negotiations with the VSB,  the addition of a clause under MSP that  states "for same gender spouse, the Board  will pay the premium for that spouse" is being proposed and Ron Richings of the VMREU has expressed confidence there will  be agreement. With more employers forking over premium payments, an unexpected  ally in the fight to change provincial legisla  tion is likely to emerge: it will suddenly be  in the interests of management to see legislated change that benefits lesbians and gays.  The City of Vancouver does not provide  benefits to the same sex partners of its employees; such a provision will be included in  this fall's bargaining with the VMREU. In  the meantime, a policy grievance was instituted in January on the grounds of discriminatory policy in "not providing benefits and  other contractual entitlements with respect  to same-gender spouses that the City woulc  provide to any other common-law spouses."  The union has not yet received a reply from  the Director of Personnel and it is possible the City will suggest waiting for negotiations.  VMREU's Richings, who has initiated  the grievance, insists that to have to bargain an end to discrimination is an extremely offensive concept. The lesbian and  gay communities should let the City know  that they find stalling, while lesbians and  gays are denied the same rights as heterosexuals, repugnant.  The LGBC feels that the focus on  benefits provides a vehicle for education  around discrimination against lesbians  and gays. As a community resource, we  would appreciate any information with  regards to complaints, successes, contract negotiations and any related research. We are currently on a waiting list for a post office box; until then  send any letters or documents to Kinesis.

Friends, lovers having a ball  by Francie Kara and Melanie Woodall      cheering, the colours and all the banners fly-  "The Gay Games are going to be a  lifetime experience for a lot of young  women. It's going to change their attitude to the way in which they lead their  lives and it may make them do something a little bit more important with  their lives ...  A lot of older women, who spent their  lives fighting for woman's rights, are going to come and they're going to stand  there, among thousands, and they 're finally going to feel renewed deep down  inside. They're going to feel a part of  history.  Then they '11 go home to struggle ...  but they can carry on because they have  been moved in so many different ways  ...  by so many different people."  -Luce Roberts  It started with a conversation between  a few friends a decade ago, and of all the  wacky things friends say they're going to do  but never get around to, one idea just happened to stick.  The last two decades have been full of  ground-breaking changes in women's lives.  Women's centres opened, women found  their collective voice. We were discovering  our independence and self-reliance.  So, starting the first Vancouver lesbian  soccer team seemed like a natural thing  to do. You may not think it such a big  deal compared to other notable events that  changed women's lives. But consider that  it wasn't until the 70s that Vancouver high  school girls were allowed to play soccer  on teams, so the idea of a lesbian soccer  team playing in the Metro Women's Soccer League was kind of radical—in the cool  sense of the word.  The Fir Street Gang was born in 1980. As  Luce Roberts, long-time player, coach and  one of the team's creators explains, the idea  was not so much to be a lesbian team, as  it was to play soccer and have fun. And all  the members were lesbians. The team roster  was filled with friends—and of course various lovers—and the crowd of spectators on  the Fir Street Gang's field side was always  interesting.  When the team began in 1980, no one had  heard of the "Gay Olympics." During the  next two years, the Fir Street Gang changed  to the Eastenders and acquired a sponser, a  lesbian coach, and a blue VW van. All 15  women drove down to San Francisco to represent Vancouver in the world's first Gay  Olympics in 1982.  They were wild, they were young and  they always found adventure wherever they  went. Mia Stark, an original team member,  remembers they went looking for parties in  all the wrong places. One adventure found  them lined-up outside one of San Francisco's  infamous men's bath houses. History was  shattered that night. No woman had ever  crossed that threshold, yet the group was  ushered into the all-male bastion where they  were greeted and toasted by smiling men  in skimpy towels—all in the spirit of the  games!  The following day actual history was  made at the Opening Ceremonies of the  1982 Gay Olympics. Mia Stark recounts the  emotions of the day: "You can't really be  prepared for what it's like to walk into the  stadium during the Opening Ceremonies.  Even when we were gathering on the grass  outside we didn't get the message. You hear  the speeches start and you get a little nervous, but then you go in the stadium and  it's astonishing. The place is packed—really  amazing—everyone is standing, everyone is  The Eastender's greatest fear was not  knowing the calibre of soccer they would  encounter. Vancouver, as the only international team of the four teams attending the  soccer tournament, was treated very well.  Audience attendance throughout the tournament was low, but at the final game  between a California tem and Vancouver,  a heartwarming presence appeared in the  stands. The Vancouver Men's Volleyball  team, in their white uniforms, enthusiastically cheered the women on, waving red and  white carnations. This memory goes well  with the surprise and pleasure of bringing  home the silver medal.  After the glory of 1982, the work began.  In the following years, Luce Roberts and  would need cold hard cash. So team managers Francie and Ruth approached the  most popular woman's bar at the time, the  Lotus Lounge. They arranged for sponsorship, organized fundraisers and changed the  teams name to the Lotus Kaze (translation  Lotus Breeze).  By August 1986, San Francisco was all  dressed up, with open arms to welcome the  gay world and to start the festivities: the  international flavour, the flying balloons,  the rainbow-coloured banners, the proclamations, the emotional fireworks. And the  Vancouver women's team was there, taking  part in another milestone in gay history.  By now, soccer was a more significant  event. The Vancouver team had an idea  of what to expect and they were ready  Corrine Hunt alternated between playing  and coaching. The arrangement was awkward, as Luce recalls. The team was in transition, seemingly on the verge of disbanding,  so it was with mixed emotions that she hung  up her cleates, armed herself with coaching  skills, a shiny new whistle and took on the  role of coach.  They were wild,  they were young...  they found adventure  wherever they went.  With the 1986 San Francisco Gay Games  II on the horizon, the team started to organize. It was going to be expensive—they  photo by F. Ka.ru  for competition. Luce Roberts recalls: "The  team dynamics were great, the athletes  loved each other ... it was a total celebration. It wasn't an alcoholic brawl, it was  very moving and uplifting."  The final score 1-0, San Francisco with  the gold, Vancouver with the silver medal  and the warmth from the crowd. After the  game team shirts and jackets were traded.  Mia Stark remembers a woman who came  running out of the crowd and said to her,  "I loved watching you play, would you trade  jackets with me. She called months later on  my birthday and asked if I remembered her  ... you develop friendships that last longer  than the week."  A decade has passed and three of the  original Fir Street Gang are still actively  involved. Luce Roberts, Corrine Hunt, and  Janice Carooll have stood the test of time:  through different sponsors, rosters, and  name changes, they're  still playing soc-  Canadian  Magazine Publishers  Association  mmm%  Now, 230 pubUcations to choose from!

Washington  has lifted its 5 year trade embargo and  financial aid is trickling into this impoverished nation. Contra demobilization remains the single most crucial factor to  peace and justice in Nicaragua. Yet, the  process is fraught with deception as the  10,000 or more armed contras violate the  April 19 cease-fire agreements. Witness for  Peace documentation outlines recent contra assaults ranging from the raping of  nuns to mass raids on peasant farming cooperatives.  Jill Bend was in Nicaragua during the  elections. Gabriella Moro, a Vancouver pubHc affairs reporter, recently returned after  two months in Nicaragua as an official observer for the February 25 elections.  Jill Bend: In the weeks both before and after the April 25 transfer of  power from the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) government to  the UNO (National Opposition Union)  coalition, there has been much opposition from the Nicaraguan people. Workers have been striking, students boycotting classes, and church people fasting. Does this mass groundswell of popular opinion surprise you?  Gabriella Moro: No. I don't know how  many of the people who voted for UNO  were actually voting for peace. The war was  Nicaragua (2)  The new  by Lori Rudland  financed and orchestrated by the US and  since the US backed UNO, then perhaps  with UNO in power the war would end.  After all, UNO made an election vow to  abolish the highly unpopular military draft.  The US promised to lift the trade boycott.  Now, UNO has promised to turn the economy around within 100 days from April  25th. The people had gone from sacrifice  and hardship to actual hunger. So, there  are great expectations and the people are  counting down to the 100-day promise.  The response to the UNO victory from  the very countries that had been holding aid  back, the US being the prime example, has  been a pittance. Bush is having difficulty  getting Congress to agree to $300 million,  of which $30 million is to go to the contras  for their resettlement inside Nicaragua.  Outside sources estimate that a billion  dollars annually, over the next ten years,  will be needed to make a significant reconstruction of the economy in Nicaragua.  Jill: February 25, 1990 ... election day,  Nicaragua. It was an historic event, as  this small country became the site of  the world's most highly observed election. Roughly, 4000 observers and 2000  journalists descended for the occasion  ... the new style invasion! You were  present as an official observer. What  were the real key issues of the election  process, the truths that never made it  past the United Nations, Carter Centre  and media censors?  Gabriella: If you look at the process of  the casting of ballots, the secrecy of the  vote, and the honesty of the vote counting  procedure, yes, they were technically clean  elections. Yet, elections don't happen in a  vacuum but within a context. If you are really looking at the fairness of an election,  the conditions under which the people have  lived over the years are critical. There was  a reluctance and avoidance on the part of  the official observer groups to address that  crucial question of context: the contra war  and the trade embargo.  The big question everywhere was "Are  these elections going to be free and fair?"  As an official observer, I was asking "Who  gets to decide?" Many observer groups were  simply there to proclaim that finally there is  democracy in Nicaragua and to herald the  first democratic elections in that country,  see Nicaragua page 10  Nicaragua, February 1990  vulnerability of  women  Lori Rudland toured parts of Nicaragua and this spring and spoke with trade  union and women's representatives.  "The arguments of the men of the National Directorate and the National Assembly were always well-founded. We were told  to wait, wait, this isn't the right time," said  Maria Lourdes Bolarnos, lawyer and director of the Ixchen Health and Legal Centre  for Women in Managua.  "In the beginning women had a strategy to reform the laws but the contra war  heated up in 1983. Then after the contra  were defeated, we were told we must fight  the election and work for peace. Now it's  too late. We lost the election and the most  backward sector of Nicaragua has formed  the government."  Lourdes said she wasn't trying to criticize individual men in the government but  to criticize the patriarchal culture. Men of  good faith, she said, must take seriously the  very desperate situation that women are in.  "The number one cause of death for  women in Nicaragua is botched abortions,"  said Lourdes. "When we tried to get the  abortion law changed, they even called us  counter-revolutionary because they claimed  we were talcing the focus off the contras.  Abortion should have been eliminated as a  criminal offence and offered free in the hospitals."  She added rape to the examples of  Nicaraguan law where women are victimized instead of protected. Proposed changes  to rape laws and laws regarding violence  to women and children were delayed by  the Sandinista government, along with the  abortion issue, until after the February 1990  election.  Now, a major concern of Ixchen health  centres in Managua and Matagalpa is inflation. Lourdes hoped they could operate for  another two months without raising prices,  but during the period of our visit, prices  doubled.  Sandra Ramos is the head of the  Women's Secretariat of the newly reorganized Sandinista Central Labour Federation (CST). The federation is the largest in  Nicaragua and represents 150,000 workers,  of whom 60,000 are women and at least one-  third are single parent mothers. With a wry  smile and shrug of her shoulders, Ramos  hinted at challenges ahead when she told us  she was the only woman serving with a 20  man federation executive.  There are no social  services to buffer  hard times and a  woman without family  support is extremely  vulnerable...  Ramos talked about the problem of  machismo in Nicaraguan society and how it  has been tackled by the union movement.  "The men can be quite irresponsible and  they may move between two or three different families," she said. In a rare case where  battering was confronted, Ramos enlisted  the support of the men of the union to provide economically for the battered woman  and children while her husband went to jail.  There are no social services to buffer hard  times and a woman without family support  is extremely vulnerable and may not be able  to afford to prosecute her partner.  Ramos has consistently fought for the  establishment of daycare centres. In two  of the eight workplaces we visited where  the Secretary-General was a woman (both  were strong, experienced feminists who had  worked through the revolution) the factories had large, well-staffed daycare centres.  One worksite was a textile factory affiliated  to the CST and the other was a tobacco  factory affiliated to the farmworkers federation. In the other worksites, many of which  had large populations of women workers,  daycare was on the list along with other priorities.  Through the CST Women's Secretariat,  Ramos has offered training workshops on  union organization which usually include a  section on sexuality, family planning and  the laws which concern women.  The CST was forced to restructure following the February election and Ramos  works most of the day at her meat-packing  plant, with the rest of her day and evening  allotted to the labour federation. She is fully  committed to women workers and believes  that a strong labour federation is the only  hope of making any changes at the workplace.  Although wages for unionized workers  are the best in Nicaragua, wages are extremely low and an important part of her  income—like other  workers—is the food  basket supplement negotiated with the collective agreement. Beans and rice are core  items. Her family is also very supportive of  her work, and her husband and sister help  her with childcare.  With the aid of another solidarity  project, Ramos helped train 62 women in  non-traditional trades last fall. In December, I visited Nicaragua and toured this  project where women were learning, among  other things, automotive mechanics, refrigeration and welding. From an occupational  health and safety standpoint, I had some  concerns with the women welders in masks,  aprons, gloves and high heels but, overall,  I was impressed with the project and the  women's confidence. Like women in Canada,  their reasons for taking the program ranged  from making more money to showing the  men that women could do the job just as  well.  "Women are usually the least-skilled and  have the least access to skills," Ramos said,  "so this program is really important to their  advancement and how they view themselves  on the job."  For Nicaraguan women, the current period is critical. Ramos said, "We will fight  to keep the gains we have won in our  ten years of revolution. Machismo is strong  but we have made advances." The recent  strike of public sector workers (UNE), many  of whom are women, portrayed a militant  labour movement in Nicaragua determined  to have a voice in government.  For myself, I can't help thinking about  the waiting, the laws that weren't reformed, the greater vulnerability of women  under the new regressive government of  Nicaragua, headed by a woman of privilege.  KINESIS International  s  ome people thought Nicaraguans could go on forever being hungry and shot at and killed.  Nicaragua from page 9  even though the truth is that there were  freely-held elections there in 1984 and the  Sandinistas were voted in.  Jill: What will happen now to the  progressive changes of the last ten  years, formulated within the Constitution? For example, will the agrarian reform laws be protected?  Gabriella: In the agreements reached  between the outgoing and incoming governments, land use concessions that had been  made prior to February 25 would be protected. It is a big question mark what will  happen to people who have claimed land in  the interim two months. A thousand families have taken over a huge empty lot beside  a market in Managua. They cleared the lot  and started marking areas off with a stake  in the ground, with their name on it and an  "occupied" sign. City Hall was then asked  to come down, take a census, and measure  off the plots for public record. But whatever  the issue, if it is covered by the constitution,  it won't be easy for UNO to change because  changing the Constitution requires at least  60 percent of the vote in the National Assembly and UNO just doesn't have it.  Jill: Two days after the FSLN election defeat, President Daniel Ortega  spoke to about 2000 internationalists.  mother of eleven children, one of whom was  killed by the National Guard just one year  before the FSLN victory. After the elections, she talked with myself and three other  foreign women living in her home, asking  that we not abandon Nicaragua or forget  her and her people. It is more important  now than ever that we maintain our relationship with the Nicaraguans.  The question is not whether solidarity  groups will stay on but what will be the  UNO government's policies towards them.  Vice-President elect Virgilio Godoy is very  unhappy with the internationalists and has  threatened that the red and black flag-  wavers should pack their bags and go  home. On the other hand, UNO moderates  have stated that internationalists working  in health clinics, water projects and so on,  are welcome. Witness for Peace has confirmed they will stay on in Nicaragua, as  have Tools for Peace, Oxfam and most other  solidarity groups.  Jill: Many Salvadorans have fled persecution to find a peaceful home in  Nicaragua, establishing craft and agricultural co-operatives, starting businesses and forming living communities. Considering the climate for these  refugees back in their homeland, as well  as in the neighbouring Central American countries, what future are they looking at?  Another...issue...we may be facing...is to  convince the Canadian government that  Nicaraguans fleeing their "democratic" country  are justifiable political refugees...  What did he offer to the solidarity network?  Gabriella: Ortega reminded us that  internationalists have been welcomed in  Nicaragua these ten years and the FSLN  fought for our right to be there just as they  will now continue to fight for the right of solidarity workers to participate in Nicaraguan  society. The Sandinistas have reassured us  that the revolution has not come to an end  and that the FSLN "will govern from below,  together with the people."  Jill: What process of adjustment have  the solidarity activists been through in  these two months of transition? And  what seems to be the policies of the  UNO government toward that community?  Gabriella: The woman I have lived with  in Managua is a 70 year old widow and  Gabriella: A great deal of uncertainty  and anxiety. The day after the election, I  spoke with a Salvadoran friend living in  Nicaragua. She looked at me many times  and said "What are we going to do?" No-  one knows. Nicaragua has welcomed many  people from all over the world, as well as  those from El Salvador. The question for  them is whether the UNO will permit them  to stay, and on exactly what terms.  Jill: In fact, for these past 11 years,  Nicaragua has been a safe haven for  refugees and freedom fighters from  many diverse nations throughout Latin  America, as well as Ireland. Their fear  is that they must now flee again.  Gabriella: Another very real issue that  we may be facing, down the road, is the battle to convince the Canadian government  that Nicaraguans fleeing their "democratic"  Tbis publication is regularly indexed In the Canadian Women's  Periodicals Index.

H there is a civil war, or increased repression from the UNO government or from forces within the country that  the government can't control... this will be  the outcome. It is more and more difficult  to receive immigration approval in Canada  through the avenue of refugee status.  Jill: Recently, the FSLN leadership  said that they are working on revising  the policy around abortion because the  opinion within the country is changing  and the laws must respond to that.  Gabriella: Last fall, Ortega stated that  he is personally not opposed to abortion,  and the work that must be done is around  prevention. When we met with a representative of AMNLAE [FSLN women's organization], she explained that their plan was  to launch discussions with the FSLN, after the elections, about reviewing the abortion laws. They had to recognize that even  if they were able to overcome the enormous  pressure of the Roman Catholic church in  that country and change the law, they were  in no position to provide adequate health facilities for that service. If abortion was decriminalized, where are these women to go?  They would be creating yet another problem if they could not meet the demand, although women with money can always obtain an abortion through private clinics and  hospitals outside of the national health care  system.  Jill: There are now two progressive  and independent Ixchen Women's Centres, in Managua and Matagalpa, working to improve the situation of women's  health in Nicaragua.  Gabriella: We met last year with the director of the Managua Ixchen Centre. They  run health programs providing services such  as abortion, sex counselling, and AIDS information. Abortion is still illegal under the  Criminal Code, and even if a hospital committee were to approve an abortion, you also  must have the signature of either your partner or father.  Jill: For eleven years, Nicaragua has  served as a symbol of revolutionary  power ... to make the dream into reality. Yet many of us held it as such  a romantic image that it became an illusion shattered as the Sandinistas lost  the elections. After the first tears dried,  people looked deeper and saw that it was  not a moment of defeat but of great  learning of the character of struggle and  freedom.  Gabriella: What I saw, in my barrio, was  the tears and the sometimes anger and frustration. I heard the words that "some people, by voting this way, have betrayed their  country" yet it still seemed that the people I came in contact with, within 48 hours,  CROSSLAND CONSULTING  Personal Management  Services for Artists  * FIRST CONSULTATION FREE*  Jackie Crossland  By Appointment Only 682-3109  went through the pain and the grief and the  anger and then started picking themselves  up.

So, people started  gathering around and the discussion began  about what needed to be done. We, as internationalists, were still dealing with our  emotions and trying to pick our chins up off  the ground while Nicaraguans were already  busy organizing.  I think some people thought Nicaraguans  could go on forever being hungry and being  shot at and killed. That was part of the romantic illusion that we had ... that they  could continue being squeezed and that they  would never vote as they did.  .KINESIS  She  Who*  Creates*  O\9tor\  .

Take the district of Stirling, for instance.  Located to the northeast of Glasgow, Stirling's main attraction is its massive castle,  once the residence of Mary Queen of Scots.  But a walk through the winding streets  of this otherwise ordinary town reveals attractions any backpacking feminist notices  immediately: a women's centre, a women's  health clinic, a worker's nursery, a daycare  centre for shoppers in the local mall and the  Stirling Women's Technology Centre.  As well, government-sponsored groups  such as the Stirling Miscarriage Group and  the Women's Oral History Project meet regularly throughout the year.  A recent addition to these groups is  Women and the Media, a collective of about  a dozen women whose mandate is to promote non-sexist language and improve the  image of women in print and electronic media. At a meeting held earlier this spring,  women in the group discussed organizing  public education seminars and resolved to  send a list of alternatives to sexist language  to local radio stations.  Clearly, mainstream British media remains a bastion of sexist attitudes towards women. Women who work in the  print media cover mostly "soft" issues:  women's pages (cooking and gardening),  gossip columns and features. Many newspaper publishers justify this by filling their  papers with pornographic images of women  and endless columns of men's sport results,  then pointing out that women are a minority readership when it comes to news and  one or two pages of beauty tips is a compromise on their part.  Saying no to the Poll Tax 1990  photo by Lisa Schmidt  Great Britain  The infamous "page 3 girl", a so-called  institution in daily tabloids across the  country, features a semi-nude woman with  some ridiculous caption about how friendly,  lonely, etc. she really is. Scottish Women  Against Pornography (SWAP) is at the  forefront of the struggle to abolish page 3  girls and is becoming increasingly active in  the fight to get porn off the shelves. SWAP  has been active in promoting a boycott of  W.H. Smith magazine shops and has organized demonstrations in which large groups  of women march into stores where porn is  sold and proceed to pull it off the shelves  and dump it on the floor.  But by far and large, the main issue for  women and men in Scotland, as in the rest  of Britain, is the community charge, or, as  it is commonly called, the poll tax.  Essentially, the poll tax is a head tax,  meaning that it is not based on income,  property, wealth or even ability to pay. It is  levied at the municipal level and serves to  pay for public amenities such as schooling,  road repair and various social services. Everyone over the age of 18, with a few minor  exceptions, must pay the amount decreed by  their municipal government or run the risk  of being fined, jailed or of having their possessions seized and sold to cover the payment.  Not surprisingly, those worst affected by  the new tax are people with low or no income, a majority of whom are women. And  while most students are required to pay  only 20 percent of their poll tax bill, student nurses are required to pay the full  amount. Many student nurses are now debating whether to leave school as a result of  such a severe rise in their expenses.  To date, 20 percent of Scots have not  paid the poll tax and the "Don't pay,  don't collect" movement continues to gather  momentum. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher—once known as "Maggie  Thatcher—milk snatcher" when as Minister of Education, she withdrew funding to a  lunchtime milk program in public schools—  is the main force behind the poll tax.  In the decade since her Tory party came  to power, the British have watched their  country become privatized to an alarming  degree. A recent example of this is the sale  of the national sewage system to a French  conglomerate.  But where English and Scots are united  against the poll tax and the privatization of  their common infrastructure, they continue  Saying no to the Poll Tax 1381  to be at odds concerning the sovereignty of  Scotland as a nation.  There has been speculation that Scotland may become the "British Lithuania" as  Scottish nationalist sentiment continues to  grow in leaps and bounds under Thatcher's  free-market policies, which are often to the  detriment of Scotland's economic health.  The possibility of an independent Scotland could mean good news for Scottish  women.  In one area of Scotland, the Scottish  Labour Party, a proponent of an independent Scotland, is committed to pushing for  a 50/50 gender split within a Scottish parliament. For women active in national politics, this opportunity has been a long time  coming.  Hopefully, the trend towards creating a  government that truly represents Scottish  women, a majority at 54 percent of the population, will continue to grow and Scottish  women will take up where Mary Queen of  Scots left off—-running the country.  There's good news and bad news...  by Kinesis Writer  The pro-choice movement in Great Britain was buoyed by an unexpected victory in late April when the House of Commons passed abortion legislation more liberal than the existing law.  The victory was all the sweeter since it  arose from the failed efforts of the anti-  choice lobby to dismantle the existing 1967  Abortion Act, a law which allowed abortions until the 28th week of pregnancy. Anti-  choice MPs had sought to append a restrictive abortion clause to another proposed  law, the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill, which was being hurried through  parliament in three weeks.  The abortion clause was passed and while  it reduced the time limit for abortions by  four weeks, to 24 weeks, it also established  "exceptions" to the time limit which will  Ukely result in greater access to abortion.  Specifically, the two exceptions are the  risk of "fetal abnormality" and "grave permanent injury to the physical or mental  health of the pregnant woman." No upper time limit was placed on these circumstances, a completely new development in  British abortion law.  As well, the clause separated the 1929 Infant Life Preservation Act from the abortion law. The IFP Act's statutory ruling on  viability has been used to prosecute doctors  and had limited their willingness to perform  late abortions. With the separation, women  who require late abortions will be in a better position to obtain them.  While women in Great Britain still lack  unrestricted choice on abortion, feminists  are viewing this turn of events as a major  defeat for the fundamentalist anti-abortion  lobby. "It is a dramatic example of the ever-  increasing political clout which women possess," said Anne Kane of the National Abortion Campaign, who attributed the victory  to steady pressure by women on Labour  MPs who were not initially firm in their support.  Kane added: "No doubt the anti-abortionists overplayed their hand. Well-reported Operation Rescue assaults on abortion clinics and sending fetal dolls to MPs  pushed waverers over to the pro-choice  camp, in a bid to distance themselves from  extremist anti-abortion tactics."  Not all femimsts are happy, however,  about the outcome of the vote on the main  body of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill, which passed by a margin of  almost 2:1 on April 23. The bill permits scientific research on human embryos up to  fourteen days old, and many feminists are  concerned such experimentation will only  increase the state's control over women's reproductive choices. Others believe embryo  research will lead to greater choices, such  as improved success rates for in vitro fertilization.  (The Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill grew out of the Warnock report, Great Britain's "Royal Commission"  on new reproductive technologies.)  With the abortion clause in place and  the research bill passed, attention has now  shifted to another amendment to the bill  which attempts to restrict access to donor  insemination. The targets of this amendment are lesbians and "other unmarried  women" (the legislation would restrict access to some married women only).  The Campaign for Access to Donor Insemination (CADI) calls the amendment  "horrific ... nothing short of stating that  only certain women should be allowed to  have children." CADI is demanding equal  access to donor insemination for all women  on the National Health Service plan (medicare) regardless of income.

The   audience   viewed  skits that had originally  been  presented   by   women   of   the  South Asian Students Association  and Philippine   Women  Centre during VSW's "Gather-  ring Strength,  Gaining Power" series  last February (see Kinesis, April 1990  for a  description  of the skits).   Terrie Hamazaki recently spoke with both  groups to continue the dialogue.  Terrie Hamazaki: What motivated  you to create and perform these skits ?  Sunera Thobani: Part of it was my  anger. I was quite young when I came to  live in the West and for years my life was  just shattered ... I just couldn't cope with  living here. At that time, Asians were very  scattered and so it was experienced at a  very personal level. Then you move into the  phase of learning that it's not you, that it's  all in a political context, and then it becomes even more personal.  Jyoti Sanghera: A common denominator is the anger we feel—and to not feel terrible about it. I've been in the West only  five years. In India, we'd talk about issues,  read a lot about racism, and also criticize  the books that white feminists would write  about our history ... Then I came here,  and the first time that somebody looked at  me differently—the first time you begin to  notice your colour—it came as a real shock.  Despite having read and heard about all  these experiences, it hits you deep down. It's  a bloody shattering experience.  Raj Panna: Growing up here, you internalize the racism and you start to feel  like a walking disease or something ... and  you start to feel anger at yourself. For a  long time I was silent and quiet. And now,  when I say to someone, "fuck you, you just  insulted me," they say, "why are you so  angry?" when before it was, "you should  have more confidence in yourself and express your anger, Raj."  I remember an anthropology class called  'Human Sexuality' where two white women  were giving presentations on clitoridectomy.  What got to rm? was that they were really  focussing on the anatomical details of it all,  and it was like they were saying, "look how  backwards and repressed these women in  the Middle East are." These incidents build  up.  Amarat Pannun: I've been involved in  white women's groups ... being the token  woman of colour on a board. Working with  women of colour has made it easier for me  to talk about the feelings I have. These skits  are from our own personal experiences, and  we have to be taken seriously.  Terrie: What we  ter the performana  e your thoughts  in May?  if-  Sunera: The laughter was totally unexpected in certain parts of the skits, and  sometimes it's a nervous laughter. The reason for doing the skits was to start building  alliances with women of colour.  Amarat: A white woman came up to me  and said that she really enjoyed the play  and realized that she had to re-think a lot  of things.  Jyoti: I remember sitting in on a lecture once about how women got the vote in  such-and-such a year and it just bypassed  them that such a large number of immigrant people, women and men both, weren't  given the vote till 20 years or even more after that. This distortion of history and the  political significance and consequences of  that are so crucial. Both in Canada and the  United States, the white women have [colluded] with men in order to exclude people  of colour ... and then they talk about all  women being the same because their struggle is against patriarchy, but they've gone  systematically in excluding women and men  of colour just because certain concessions  and powers were being doled out to them.  And it's very popular and current to have  assertiveness-training programs for women.  Personally, I object to the kind of individualism and liberalism which is interjected  through these programs: to become tins individual woman who is articulate, who can  speak, who knows how to conduct meetings.  It goes against the grain of a lot of women-  centred cultures that we come from where  we work as a community and as a group, not  as an individual. Instead of turning us immigrant women into atomized, self-assertive  individuals, learn from us how to become  community-oriented. And that's one way  that white feminism hasn't talked about  undoing patriarchy: fighting patriarchy instead of becoming patriarchal through that  individualistic sense.  Sunera: I'd like to see more interaction between women of colour where we  work together and not fall into the trap  The revolutionary element in feminism  right now is the women of colour...  if white feminists don't become anti-racist,  then it will become a bankrupt movement.  Raj: And someone may read this article  and think, "Oh, now I'm informed, now I've  seen the light." But at the same time, just  as some white women were thanking us for  our performances, don't think I'm so grateful and thankful that you understand me.  There's still a long way to go.  Jyoti: One of the questions that constantly keeps coming up from white women  is, "How has it helped you as a group?"  Bullshit! How is it going to matter to you  how it's helped us as a group? And it's again  disassociating themselves from the real issues we are raising by asking, "How has it  empowered you? How has it helped you?  And I really resent that.  Sunera: The issue of racism in the white  women's movement is not something new,  and until now if they haven't taken this  into account or been open to it, in a sense  how many more years are we going to spend  just hoping to educate them. It's way past  the time to have moved on and that's what  we're doing. Some of them may come along  with us and others won't. But we're not going to let that debate stop us, because then  it becomes a stalling mechanism, "explain  to me again and again and again."  I think the revolutionary element in feminism right now is the women of colour and  I think that if white feminists don't become  anti-racist, then it will become a bankrupt  movement.  Sunera: I think what's been wrong with  the white feminist movement is that they've  been speaking for all women without being accountable to all women ... you have  to make yourself accountable ... and you  are accountable, otherwise you fall into opportunism and careerism which I think we  can see has clearly happened in the white  women's movement. And we as women of  colour also need to make ourselves accountable to other women of colour because it's  not a personal struggle.  Terrie: What about women of colour  being called separatists?  Sunera: As a group I really feel that as  women of colour, to have an autonomous  group is very important. It means that my  first right that I claim as a woman of colour  is to autonomous women of colour groups.  Jyoti: To the extent that women have  raised that same point in the trade union  movement, they will have no moral platform to stand on unless they concede that  right to us and recognize that as our political right as women of colour, because of our  situations being different.  Terrie: Anything in closing?  Jyoti: What does it mean when there are  these workshops held: unlearning racism—  what exactly does that mean? Can it be  unlearned through workshops? What is the  process of unlearning, how is it linked to the  political economy of the world?  of dividing—this whole thing of ethnicity,  where you're this and I'm that.  Jyoti: Personally, I feel very optimistic  about the years to come because more and  more women of colour are going to find  forms of expression to bear various emotions  they've had.  he exploitation of domestic  workers in Canada, over 50  percent of whom are women  from the Philippines, was highlighted in the play Housemaids  presented by the Philippine Women  Centre (PWC) of Burnaby, B.C.  The skits were prefaced by a slide  show depicting women's struggle in the  Philippines: women working in the factories, peasant women harvesting food,  sex-trade workers, revolutionary fighters, with connections made to women's  struggles here.  Terrie: Tell me about the Philippine  Women Centre.  Cecilia Diocson: Due to the increasing number of domestic workers coming to  Canada from the Philippines, we thought  that there should be a separate group for  Filipinas. Coming from another country,  there is a lot to adjust to. Women get home  sick or want a place to get together on week- •  ends.  Elena Cruz: We noticed that there's no  Philippine group that can really offer good  support to Filipinas, and not only for the  domestic workers.  Lorrie S. de Vera: I heard of this group  through a friend of mine because I'm a newcomer to this place, and it's great to know  it because I want a sense of belonging and  I feel supported by this group of women.  Oyette Encarnacion: I was a member  of an organization in the Philippines and  when I came here, I asked my cousin if there  were any Philippine groups, and I joined  the BC Committee for Human Rights in the  Philippines (BCCHRP), then this group.  Cecilia: The founding members of the  PWC are also involved in the women's sector of BCCHRP ... and we get a lot  of support from the other members. As a  group, we have not been involved with the  West Coast Domestic Workers Association  (WCDWA) collectively but on an individual basis, we maintain links in one way or  another. I'd attended a few meetings with  them a few years ago, but felt slighted because I'd said to the organizers at one point  that it would be a good idea to include in  their education/training a session for the-  Philippine women, where they can look at  the situation in their homeland, and their  reasons for coming here, and they said, "No,  no, these are local issues" and they just ignored it. This shows the insensitivity of this  group not wanting to understand our culture and where we come from.  Of all the domestic workers coming from  overseas, over 50 percent are Filipinas and  if you already recognize these numbers, you  have to do something, you don't just ignore  this. I think that there was a low level of understanding of the international dimensions  of feminism. The influx of women domestics  is related to the economic and political crisis in the Philippines.  Elena: I think what they're [WCDWA]  concentrating on right now are the cases  that are arising here, and I think it doesn't  matter to them where you come from; but  for us, you have to have understanding of  the roots, how the problem came about,  where and why it's happening.  Cecilia: We first formed the Filipino Domestic Workers of BC, a group within the  WCDWA, and we were quite active. When  the WCDWA heard that we had this group  going and it was going really well, some of  the members called us separatists, and told  us that we're racist because we just want to  be with ourselves. So we talked about it at  one of our meetings and an idea came about  that the WCDWA would be our mother organization and I said, "We don't need a  mother organization."  We encourage women in the PWC to become members of the WCDWA ... they're  an advocacy group, they have legal counsel.  Our function is complementary with theirs  so we are there to support their efforts.  Maybe some of them think we're a threat  to their organization. I believe that they  couldn't accept leadership from us. I think  that anybody can form their own organization.  Terrie: What's your future agenda?  Cecilia: What we are trying to do is  go beyond the issues of domestic workers.  It's good to have your immediate needs  looked after first, but once you become an  immigrant, the struggle as a woman goes  on. Maybe we have liberated ourselves as  domestic workers, but as women, no. The  struggle continues.  Elena: We'll be performing more plays  to show our experiences at work. We want  to show to the public that we are human beings, not robots. And because it's  housework—women's work—it's not considered a profession. We get looked down upon.  mestic workers. I call these agencies pimps  because they ask for fees from women to  come to their dances, when actually it's  pimping these women ... old white men  who want to get a young Filipina wife.  Lorrie: I had gone to one of those dances  just to see what goes on, and what I observed was there's no white women, only  brown women dancing with white men.  Lani Bautista: And these agencies try  to convince the Philippine women, "If you  get married to that man, you'll become an  immigrant and get wealthy, own a big car,  a house;" but in reality, the man treats you  like a slave.  ...they think they're so benevolent  giving jobs to these women from Third  World countries: 'they're so cute, so  tiny, they work so hard...'  Cecilia: [Our play] will raise the consciousness of white women who think nothing was going on in this group of women.  You know, they think they're so benevolent giving jobs to these women coming from  Third World countries: "they're so cute, so  tiny, they work so hard, they're so reliable." And skits about matchmaking agencies whose sole purpose is making money  and using women, especially Philippine do-  Terrie: The audience at your May  performance was mostly women of  colour.  Oyette: It's great to inform, to show  women the reality of our lives as domestic  workers. A white woman said to me after  the performance that ... she's ashamed to  be a white woman.  Elena: But it's not just white employers  who are maltreating the domestic workers,  but every nationality is doing it. If you have  someone working and living in your house,  it's so easy to exploit that person.  Letty Soto: I'm proud to be a woman of  colour, a Filipina. Some people look down  on us because we are domestic workers, but  if you do it honestly, you can hold your head  high.  Lanie: It's obvious that all the discriminated people are people of colour. I feel sad  because we're all human beings, we should  be able to work together. For me, I want  white people to be with us.  Cecilia: We're planning workshops, concerts, skill-sharing and of course more plays.  I hope more white women will come to our  activities. But when they ask, "what can we  do?"— that question is so rhetorical from  the white women. Why do they have to  ask? They know they've been the exploiters  for years; they should know that women of  colour are struggling. Their place as white  women in the women's movement is secure.  I don't want our group to be seen as a  cultural curiosity; these are social issues. I  know white women will come when it's art  for art's sake.  The majority of women in the world are  women of colour. We realize that; where are  they going if they don't realize that? They  just want to write beautiful papers and stories about us. We're not going to be guinea  pigs anymore. As women of colour, we're doing something, and it's part of our struggle  to feel angry, and we have a right to criticize white women. We don't want to be ignored, we want to be heard and have things  done. WE want change.  ■  k^-  ££2£^Xtea"^^«-^  .KINESIS  KINESIS  KINESIS  KINESIS     Jun,  90 13 Commentary  What possessed her?  Observing the devil at work  by Frances Wasserlein  I decided to go to the Delta River Inn on  Saturday 28 April to hear what Carol Gran,  BC's Minister Responsible for Women's  Programs, had to say to REAL Women's  National Convention.  I arrive just before 1 pm, walk in the  front door, see a registration table and walk  past—I don't intend to give this organization any money. I feel a little nervous, like I  might be accosted at any moment and asked  why I am here.  I'm here to see if Gran will deliver a placating message or a critical one. I pick up  a program, printed on pink paper, in blue  ink. Cute, eh? On the front of the agenda  for the two day conference are the words  "Realwomen of Canada presents "Towards  2000—Equality in the Information Age."  Women and a few men are wearing tags  on their necks, again pink paper, with  names and affiliations noted. The media is  present in large numbers.  the ministry's purpose and responsibilities,  mentioning that her position as minister of  Government Management Services is "the  perfect complement to women's programs  because it touches every department of government." She tells the still attentive listeners that the expertise of these departments  gives her access she wouldn't have to information if the woman's programs work was  done in isolation.  Gran says she's been travelling the  province for six months, speaking to and  consulting with women's groups. She describes her mandate as minister responsible for women's programs and says "I carry  that advocacy role to the cabinet...There is  a great deal to be done, both society and  government have neglected the needs and  concerns of women."  The minister then tells the audience a  little about her personal life, saying she  grew up in an unhappy home and that her  love and admiration for her mother and  her faith helped her get through the diffi-  I ask a woman from Canadian Press "Are  you here for the media workshop?" "No,"  she said, "we're here for Carol."  Over the next half hour REAL Women  gather outside the doors of the luncheon  room. Two security guards stand near a table placed at such an angle to create only a  narrow entry way to the room. Perhaps the  organizers suspect there will be a demonstration. But I'm all by myself  I've been noticed. I am wearing socks,  and of the 50 or so women I can see, only  one other is wearing socks. I have on a red  sweater, pastel colours abound. I am leaning  against a pillar, and there is an empty area  around me. I hear women in dresses discussing how fast lipstick wears off. I see anti-  abortionists whose faces are familiar from  Everywoman's Health Centre blockades and  demonstrations. James and Karen Hanlon  are there, holding hands. So is Sissy von  Dehn and the unemployed minister from  Burnaby. All but two of the faces, including  my own, are white.  Eventually a woman announces we will  be let into the room to hear Carol Gran's  speech. We file in. I stand at the back, looking for a good view of Gran, clipboard and  pen in hand for notes. At the head table  sits local president Peggy Steacy in a red  suit, former national president Gwen Landolt and three other women. Gran is standing at the podium, checking the sound while  the media types put their tape recorders  and microphones in place. Gran wears a  pink suit: and I wonder if she's heard Margaret Atwood's advice: to disarm your enemies, wear pink.  Gran begins by saying it's a privilege  to have been invited to speak and thanks  the group for their invitation. She then  welcomes the out-of-province delegates on  behalf of the  government.  She explains  cult times. Gran says, "I have been where  80,000 women in this province are," that is,  single sole support mothers, with little income. Her comment that "The privilege of  motherhood will always be my most precious role," is greeted with sustained loud  applause.  "Women do not want to be patronized,"  says Gran. "They want equal opportunity  and a level playing field. There is a critical shortage of childcare spaces in this  province." No applause. She says childcare  facilities are necessary for women who wish  to work.  "Education is the ticket to freedom for  women and girls," says Gran. "A girl must  make her education her highest priority."  No applause.  "Women in BC earn less than 65 cents  to a man's dollar," Gran says and speaks  briefly of the province's promise to implement pay equity in the civil service. There  is muttering and some hissing.  The provincial government has increased  funding for transition houses by 25 percent," she says. No applause.  I notice that Gwen Landolt is looking  away from Gran. She appears uncomfortable and unhappy.  "Homemakers all over the province,"  Gran says, "are asking for a fair income tax  break." Applause.  The proposal for a BC pension plan, accessible to homemakers, is also greeted by  applause.  Gran talks about visiting a second-stage  transition house and listening to the stories  of the six women who live there. The room  becomes almost electrically still. The stories she heard were "all too common and  tragic," and she was especially moved by  the "devastating effects on the children."  Gran continues. "Knowing this, it is  time to talk about the polarization among  women's groups. Recent surveys tell us that  10 percent of women in BC are radical feminists. 10 percent think women have advanced far enough, and 80 percent have  some feminist views but are more moderate." Gran then quoted Webster's dictionary definition of feminism and says she  considers herself to be "a moderate person,  a moderate feminist," and that she "rejects  the notion that the advancement of women  is destructive to the family."  There is no applause. I am a little astonished by what seems to me a brave act.  Gran notes it has been a difficult week  and that "an unfortunate letter, sent out by  an unsuspecting government, by a group of  people who should know better" is blatantly  intolerant, and that "there is no room for  intolerance." At this point Sissy von Dehn  gets up and leaves the room. Gran says,  "I urge you to publicly reject this letter."  There is a chorus of "No's."  This ends her speech. I am really surprised. There is brief, not very enthusiastic applause. Several women stand up and  one says loudly "this is an unjust attack on  our group." Gwen Landolt tells them to sit  down, there is another speaker and there  will be no dialogue.  A woman I recognize from other REALW events thanks Gran for her speech.  She speaks very briefly, mentioning how  much work REALW do at the constituency  level, how hard she knows Gran works at  that level. Then she says, "But I remind  you, that [as Alexis de Toqueville, author  of Democracy in America] says, a party  must have principles, a party which grounds  itself in trends and circumstances will not  outlive those trends and circumstances very  long."  She again mentions that while Gran does  not share all their views, she knows they do  share many things and that the rapidly increasing membership of REALW indicates  the organization represents diverse views of  thousands of women in Canada.  She thanks Gran again. In the course of  her thanks she has referred to Gran as the  Minister of Government Management Services twice, and does not mention that she  is also responsible for Women's programs.  There is applause, they hug.  The media splits into two groups, one at  the end of the table where Peggy Steacy  and Gwen Landolt sit, the other at the end  where Gran stands to speak to them.  I overhear the woman wearing socks and  holding a very young baby say to two other  women, "I think it is the devil trying to do  his work." I can smell the sour scent of nervous sweat on many of the women who walk  past me.  I'd like to be a fly  on the wall of the  next cabinet meeting  I'd like to be a fly on the wall of the  next cabinet meeting. It seem to me likely  that Gran has put a considerable hole in  the constituency level organizing in the Socred party cadre. Perhaps the Socreds will  lose their Langley seat. Perhaps the split  between the ordinarily conservative/liberal  side of the party and the more right-  wing extremists has been deepened. Perhaps Gran will be targeted by these women.  She did the right thing. I don't agree with  her about most things, and she's made me  angry many times. But today she did the  right thing, and I was glad to see her do it.

Kelly  is an American feminist artist whose major work, Interim, is at the Vancouver Art  Gallery until the end of July.  An examination of the portrayal of  women encountering middle age within the  patriarchal system, Interim is divided into  four sections. The latin headings—Corpus  (body), Pecunia (money), Historia (history)  and Potestas (power)—refer to the construction and origins of language, one of  Kelly's prime concerns.  The section titles also provide the viewer  with insight into the more formalized aspects of Interim: issues ranging from history and sexuality to Foucault and Marxism. The complete exhibit was constructed  over a period of five years and is now being shown in its entirety for only the second  time.  What separates Mary Kelly's work from  so much of the vacuous art-making practices in the post-modern era is her ability to reach the public. I'm not implying  that Kelly's art is easy— Interim is anything but! Yet Kelly's work has transcended  much of the heavily mediated art practices  that exclude the majority of people from  making any connections. In my opinion, she  has broken through the barriers that sur  round conceptual and post-structuralist art-  making practices.  When exploring the social construction  of women, "text" and "context" should  not be separated. The text is the ideology  that forms the theory around gender and  race and class issues. The context is simply  the other part of the puzzle, the everyday  experiences that accompany theoretically-  debated issues. The two should be inseparable but art-making is often so formalized and exclusive that it becomes accessible only to a particular audience, namely  other artists and collectors.  Interim is different. The viewer can actively engage with the piece itself. The private space created for your personal discourse may be light and comical or painfully  raw and depressing. It all depends on the  particular relation the individual spectator  takes to the show.  Kelly has attempted to present many different voices and realities, yet she doesn't  claim to represent "everywoman's" experience. (Interim is not an autobiographical  piece of work, although Kelly admits it does  draw on some personal experiences.)  One of the most interesting aspects of the  exhibition is the total absence of any physical female representation. Kelly's specific  intent was to use elements normally associated with women, ranging from clothing  and fantasy, to ownership and statistics. Al-  MARY KELLY:   INTERIM  (May 16 - July 30)  In connection with the Mary Kelly exhibition the Vancouver  Art Gallery presents:  PANEL DISCUSSION: POWER TO WHAT END?  Thursday, June 7, 7:30 pm  This panel discussion will investigate aims and outcomes of  the women's movement, particularly in relation to politics  and finance. Panelists include Shirley Chan (Board of  Directors, Vancouver City Savings), Darlene Marzani  (Member of the B.C.

PUBLIC DIALOGUE  Thursday, June 21, 7:30 pm  Artist Anne Ramsden will be the informed questioner in this  public conversation with Mary Kelly about Interim,  feminism and psychoanalysis. Moderated by, VAG Head  of Public Programmes, Judith Mastai.

Part of the strategy behind the absence  of the female body is to make another type  of pleasure available to the viewer, different  from the pleasure normally associated with  the male gaze directed toward the female  body. Whether male or female, we all react through patriarchal conditioning when  confronting images of the body. As women,  we often compare ourselves to, and question  that idea/image of femininity. The trap of  trying to be like someone fashioned by patriarchy is only part of the debate; not accepting those standards is the issue. While  I'm not advocating total censorship of body  images, I feel that Kelly's strategy here is  In Part I of the exhibition we examine  Corpus: the body, fashion, medicine and aspects of fiction. Two hundred and thirty  panels juxtapose women's apparel with text  in a diptych style. We are, for example, introduced to a woman reading a self help  manual entitled Woman's Body. Reduced  to diagrams and text to discover her future,  she reads:  "E) fertility ceases,and then F) old  age: spine drops, hearing impaired,  character changes and brain disorders  possible. God, why bother going on? It's  already started. Is it irreversible? Anne  told me she could remember the exact  day, hour even, when she became an  older woman. One morning she woke  up, looked down at her breasts and realized they, had lost their independence.  She was laying on her side, she emphasized the importance of her vantage  point since it was in that very position she had previously observed two  perfectly autonomous hemispheres defying the laws of gravity. That day, they  sloped, no slithered, to the right as they  surrendered to some imperious genetic  signal saying "take a break." I asked  how old she was and had to laugh when  she said 25. But now reading in reverse I notice C) continuous loss of  nerve cells from the age of 25, then B)  peak of physical energy over at 12. Finally their optimistic introduction, "the  aging process begins surprisingly early  and efforts to slow it down are simply  guesswork." Organic, inevitable yet we  are not at one with nature they are at  war with it. The victor becomes a legend like so many aging film stars, forever "Fabulous and Forty-two;" meanwhile, the vanquished who refuse to dye  their hair or just don't give a damn become old bags, or possibly old ladies if  they smile."  Part II Pecunia, refers to the family and  money. Written in the first person, this section incorporates classified ads and flowery  greeting card notions while examining the  social and economic system we exist in.  Pecunia is roughly translated from the  latin proverb "money does not smell." Kelly  saw the statement as a kind of joke running through the show, like comic relief from  some of the other unsettling material: obviously, in this section, money stinks. Pecunia  is made up of twenty silkscreen galvanized  steel panels and is further divided into four  sections representing the feminine positions  of Mother, Wife, Sister and Daughter.  Part III Historia is an attempt to understand the realities of the women's movement  since 1968, the year often regarded as the  start of the second wave of feminism this  century. Historia is comprised of four large  steel sculptures that resemble open books.  The text on the "pages" allows the viewer  to follow through and make a personal reflection/progression with the movement up  to current times.  Part IV Potestas refers to power and examines women's lack of power as we enter the nineties. Kelly says: "It represents,  in a way, the dichotomies—nature/culture,  man/woman—and the hierarchies that are  put into place through our particular system in language and culture." This section  was based on a statistic: Women are half the  population, do 2/3's of the work and own  less than 1 percent of the wealth.Galvanized  steel and rusted metal are used as bar  graphs in a minimalist style to give out a  message that is anything but minimal in  content.  As Kelly said in a recent panel discussion  at VAG, she does not want the last word.  It seems that, while Kelly has been offered  power and authority by the art world, she  openly invites discourse with her public and  doesn't claim to have covered every angle in  the debates surrounding women. What she  has created, however, is a major body of  work that helps change the direction of art  history and theory while attempting to include a public that has long been ignored.  KINESIS .^^^^^^^^^^  Arts  Dream tracks and memory  ON DOUBLE TRACKS  by Leslie Hall Pinder  Toronto: Lester and Orpen Dennys, 1990  by Susan Prosser  Leslie Hall Pinder's new novel begins just  before dawn. Megan Striclan, legal counsel  for a northern native Indian band, makes  final preparations for the first day of a  trial and alternately submerges in thoughts  about the turn her life has taken. Through a  strange series of events, Megan has recently  left a successful corporate law firm in order  to pursue this land claims case. She is tense;  15 years of experience seem to focus in on  this moment.  Until now, "her trials concerned what  had happened in recent memory: a contract  broken, an injury sustained ... Everything  existed within a thin, hard layer of possibilities." Today, she is to prepare the judge  to hear evidence from the memories and  dreams of the Indians, evidence which in legal tradition has been classified as heresay  and deemed inadmissible. "The judge would  have to put aside most of his held assumptions in order to understand this case."  The novel's focus then shifts to the elderly Judge Theodore Selbie who is girding his loins for the eight weeks of evidence  to be presented by Megan and the crown  attorney. He's out of sorts and regrets he  accepted the case. He convinces himself he  is competent. He is comforted by the law's  mechanistic efficiency. "But these Natives  seemed foreign to the traditions he revered,  as if they predated what he knew and would  challenge him, try to topple him." But he  would "pound out the truth."  As the narrative moves through the first  two days of the trial, Megan and the Judge  become locked in a horrific personal opposition which goes against both of their  eminently professional lives. Neither character remembers their childhood and yet  each feels their past pressing in. The 'evidence' for the Indians' land claims points  up what each has lost. Something in each  of their childhoods must be retrieved or  let go of. The narrative shifts to the childhoods of the two characters which are told  in chronological parallel. We come to know  their lives, the painful lives they have forgotten. The book gradually moves back toward the present where the "double tracks"  of past and present, dream/memory and  consciousness are spanned.  From the moment I began to read On  Double Tracks I felt a sense of suffocation. I attributed this feeling to the style of  writing which is densely wrought with simile, and these similes are layered, repeated  and negated. I felt uncomfortable because  the narrator seemed to be imposing, seemed  to be overdrawing these characters; the layers contradicted each other and I couldn't  find the character under all the narration. I  felt trapped in a maddening middle ground,  where no thought is completed and no action is definitive because the inner dialogue  moves ahead through endless contradiction.  Pinder has worked to achieve this effect.  She has quite a command of the stream of  consciousness and the leapfrog jumps of the  mind but, ultimately, this facility is mired  in over-narrated detail.  I do not object to the feelings of suffocation. In fact I was intrigued by how these  feelings mirrored those of the characters,  but ultimately it felt like all this flesh (simile) was used to conceal the fact that the  bones of the story don't meet. Pinder definitely has a penchant for the poetic but it  is too often cheap poetics. Nothing stands  for itself  The bones. Selbie is a rigid and angry  old man who is trying desperately to hide  the fact that he is no longer capable of conducting a court of law. Megan was similarly  hardened but has begun a journey back to  a more sensitive, compassionate self. The  narrative works itself up to the cataclysmic  meeting of the two: heavy foreshadowing,  dramatic exchanges in court, but the end  (which I will not divulge) does not justify  the means. More than half of the book is  devoted to the childhoods of these characters. Their individual childhoods are in and  of themselves interesting, but, especially in  Selbie's case, they don't reveal anything  that would make the emotional dynamics in  court seem any more plausible. As such, the  courtcase seems like dramatic pleading for  a plot rather than integral to the plot.  Leslie Hall Pinder has written a novel  which reads like an unwitting mystery: the  mystery is whether the narrator will ever  expose her characters in a clear light. Will  they ever move or speak for themselves?  The answer is no, but meanwhile the reader  is carried along by the often compelling  details of the characters' childhoods: the  events which draw Megan out of her corporate law firm and into the land claims case;  and the court case itself.  Pinder is a Vancouver lawyer and On  Double Tracks is her second novel. Her  first, Under the House, unfolds the family  secrets of a small-town family. That story  is told with a quiet confidence, a subtle  rendering of the twisting past and present.

The court scenes—the ambiance, Selbie's  utter ineptitude and Megan's clamour to  deal with this—are convincing. The depiction of such an unruly courtroom by someone uninitiated to this world might seem  implausible. From Pinder, who does land  claims work in her legal practice, it is an  insightful and brave indictment of the legal  system.  Maureen McEvoy ba ma (Cand.)

Arts  A remarkable novel:  Layers of passion and pain  DISAPPEARING MOON CAFE  by Sky Lee  Vancouver, Douglas & Mclntyre, 1990  by Jean Lum  I knew that once I began Sky Lee's novel  Disappearing Moon Cafe, I wouldn't  want to put it down. True enough. I feasted  and finished it in two sittings. But it takes  more than two sittings to fully digest this  chewy, rich and complex concoction.  As a reader and as a Chinese-Canadian  woman, I have been wanting to sink my  teeth into something like this for a long  time. This novel is a momentous occasion  in Canadian literary history and herstory:  Disappearing Moon Cafe is the first adult  novel authored by a Chinese-Canadian to  be published, although we have been settled in Canada for over 100 years. (Go  check your local library's card catalogue and  you'll know what I mean.)  Further, Disappearing Moon Cafe is a  story about the Chinese in Canada written  from a Chinese-Canadian vision that is also  feminist-identified. It is Lee's first novel and  it is remarkable.  Disappearing Moon Cafe has enormous breadth, a story of many stories revolving around one another. The focus is on  four generations of the Wong family, plus  a larger cast of allsorts over a roughly 100-  year time span. (The illustration of the family tree at the beginning of the book is very  useful in clarifying the kin relationships of  the characters.)  Blended into the personal endeavors of  the individual characters is Lee's acknowledgement and remembering of the lives and  truggles of the Chinese community both  in Vancouver's Chinatown and on a larger  scale. In Disappearing Moon Cafe, she  shows the earlier generations of Chinese trying to settle and survive in mythical Gum  San (the "Gold Mountain" of North America), which in reality was ripe and rotting  with anti-Asian, racist sentiment.  Most importantly, Lee does not overlook  the experiences of the women who lived  among the first generation of Chinese immigrants. Rather, she re-writes history by  rounding it out with neglected herstory. For  instance, when she mentions the Chinese  Exclusion Act—whereby a head tax was imposed upon Chinese men trying to enter  Canada—Lee also reveals how it effectively  prevented their wives and children in China  from coming over.  Many families were permanently fractured. In the case of character Lee Mui  Lan, Canadian immigration laws had disastrous consequences for her marriage to  Wong Gwei Chang: "Too many years apart  after a brief marriage ceremony in the village between two shy shuffling strangers  who saw more of their new shoes than each  other's faces. After six months, the Gold  Mountain guest was gone, and she was pregnant. The next time she saw him, they were  both too old to start again."  Thankfully, there are no mind-warping  VANCOUVER  WOMEN'S  BOOKSTORE  ^  315 Cambie Street  Vancouver, B.C.

Characters are human and fallible with a  wide range of emotions which flare and  burst throughout the stories. The Wongs, as  a family, seem very much to be a process,  in a constant flux which is neither effortless  nor painless.  The Wongs carry the burden of being  a non-white family striving to maintain itself and to cope within a hostile xenophobic  country. There are also the internal family  dynamics: opposing generational and cultural values which lighten their burden no  less. They carry a sense of isolation that  echoes that of the larger Chinese community. To whom except their own could they  cry to and scream at?  Lee's women characters are especially vibrant: sparks of willfullness, intelligence,  resourcefulness and fervor. For instance,  the relationship between Mui Lan and her  daughter-in-law Fong Mei resembles a battleground in  which both  opponents are  equally unrelenting. Mui Lan, for instance,  "Like any other village  type ...   could  shriek, cackle and swear with the best of  them." But Mui Lan is not a stereotypical tyrant of a mother-in-law because Lee  paints her with more precision, more compassion than a mere stock character:  But  there  were  probably  no  halfway  houses for women, no places to hide out  from a rocky marriage ... Ejected from  a cloister of women into the stony society  of Gold Mountain men must have been  like being smashed against a brick wall.  She wouldn't have known what shattered  her ... having never been in control of  her own life, she suddenly found herself in  charge of many people's lives. Frustrated  and isolated from the secluded life she understood, Mui Lan had to swallow bitterness, so she made her suffering felt far  and wide ... and she didn't much care  whom it soiled either.  At the other end of the spectrum there  is the intimate, loving relationship between  Kae Ying Woo and Hermia Chow which  flourishes despite the passing of time and  Author Sky Lee.  and sisterhood and Lee portrays it without  labelling or pigeon-holing.  There is also the relationship between  Wong Gwei Chan and Kelora Chen, daughter of a mother of the Shi'atko clan (native  Indian) and a Chinese father. The story of  Lee's women characters are especially  vibrant; sparks of willfulness, intelligence  resourcefulness and fervor  distance, an affirmation, in Hermia's words,  that "Women's strength is in the bonds they  form with each other ...

Could the Disappearing Moon Cafe be  like the one or two cafes on East Pender Street where you can still order coffee served aromatic and dark, already with  cream shot in from a machine by the server?  Much of Disappearing Moon Cafe occurs in and around a cafe of that name in  Vancouver's 1920s Chinatown. Throughout  her story, Lee peels back a little of Chinatown's protective outer skin, adding some  names, faces, and happenings to what outsiders may find as anonymous buildings and  streets. After reading this book, could anyone just look at Vancouver's Chinatown and  be unable to see past the crowds of shoppers, the markets, and the restaurants?  Making more intricate an already intri  cate story, the author uses various narrative devices such as first and third person  voices, letters, and leaps in time and  ting. For instance, the letters of 1919 that  Fong Mei wrote to her Elder Sister in China  reveal another facet of her character: a devotion to sisterly and familial bonds. These  bonds give Fong Mei an opportunity to feel  and interact in ways that are denied by life  in the New World. My knowledge of Chinese is limited, but Lee's letters seem to  capture the tone and language of Chinese  in translation, rendering them with an eloquence and earnestness that is tender and  poignant. Her depiction of the sisters' separation was achingly real.  The dialogue Lee's characters speak is  powerful and convincingly Chinese to me.  Words as simple as titles for addressing kin  like "A Maah made me chuckle—I think  "yeah, this is me speaking." The Chinese  language is colourful, sometimes barbed and  passionate aurally, and the author makes  it come alive to my ears. Lee uses speech  which is cutting and misogynist, reflecting a society where men were privileged.  I've probably picked up more Chinese expressions by reading this book than I have  picked up agonizingly trying to listen to spoken Chinese. There are some wonderful Chinese expressions and metaphors that just go  whoosh! flying over my head like a jumbo  jet. For instance, if Mui Lan were speaking  to me and said "... no one can accuse the  Wong family of having a wolf's heart and  a dog's lung." I could only respond with a  stunned "Whadda ya mean?"  Disappearing Moon Cafe is an intriguing creation with many layers that leaves  the reader's palate with much to ponder. I  eagerly await Lee's next work.  KINESIS smss*^s***sss^^  Arts  ;«H  Gerd Brantenberg  A big name in Norway  by Elizabeth Reba Weise  Gerd Brantenberg is one of Norway's better known authors and certainly its only  well-known lesbian author. I visited her in  her home in Oslo last spring where, over  plates of open faced sandwiches and several  pots of tea, we discussed her work, the position of writers in Norway and the role of  women in publishing.  Brantenberg's first book, What Comes  Naturally (Opp alle jordens homofil,  1973) could also be translated as "Rise Up,  homosexuals of the world!" It's the story  of a young woman coining out in Oslo in  the early 1960s. Her second novel, Egalia's  Daughters (Egalias Doetre, 1977) is a  satire set in a world where sex roles are  reverse: men must wear uncomfortable penis holders and are subject to the fascinating concept of paternal responsibility. Brantenberg deftly reverses language, creating  words such as wim and menwim that turn  our preconceived notions of gender on their  head.  Her novel, Favntak (Embrace, 1983)  tells of a relationship between two women,  one of whom is married and struggling to  free herself and begin to live according to  her true feelings.  Brantenberg's latest book, soon to be  translated into English, is For Alle Vin-  der (To the Four Winds, 1989), the third  in a trilogy about a class of school children  growing up in Brantenberg's home town  of Fredrikstad. In this final novel, one of  the young women in the class comes to  terms with her lesbianism. The first two segments, Sangen om St. Croix (The Song  of St. Croix) and Ved Fergestedet (At  the Ferry), follow the lives of the girls  through grammar and high school.  Brantenberg said, "I knew that if I wrote  about lesbianism at all in the first two books  they would be looked upon as lesbian books.  I left it out because I wanted it to be seen  as just a part of life. It's like you see a  whole picture and then you see one red dot.  And then you can only see the red dot, even  though that's just one small part of the picture. That's how it is with homosexuality.  The first two books in the series were also  ...women often write  about what happens  to them... men write  about what they do.  the first of my books that the critics saw as  "serious." Maybe it was because they didn't  deal with homosexuality."  She sees a kind of pyramid arrangement  within the publishing industry in Norway,  with women on the bottom and men at the  top.  "We don't have any women's publishing houses. Seventy percent of the people  reading are women. About 70-80 percent of  the people who borrow books at libraries  are women. Eighty percent of librarians are  women. But with writers, it's the other way  around. We are 25 percent women in the  writers union. All the directors of the publishing houses are men, and we have no professors of literature at all who are women.  The majority of readers are women and the  Gerd Brantenberg  majority of those who decide what they'll  read are men."  Norway's population of just over 5 million makes for a very small market for any  author. But Brantenberg and many other  authors manage to write full time. "We  have government grants to support authors  called Three-Year Work Grant for Artists.  There's also a guaranteed income program  for artists. You get a guaranteed minimum income of 90,000 crowns a year [about  $17,000]. The drawback is that if you earn  over a certain amount they subtract it from  your grant. So you really can't live on it unless you have a husband or wife who supports you. There are about 48 writers who  have work grants in Norway, and maybe 50  who get the guaranteed income."  Brantenberg sits down to write during  the winter, from October to May. It took her  three years to finish To the Four Winds.  "I do a lot of lecturing and touring in the  summers," she said. "And then there's quite  a lot of office work and paper work connected with writing. In the four days after  I finished the manuscript for To the Four  Winds I wrote 63 letters, mostly business  letters. I also teach creative writing courses  at the Women's University and I'm active  in the Interdisciplinary Women's Literature  Forum. We had our tenth anniversary in  the fall of 1988. I was also very active in  the first and second International Feminist  Book fairs. I was invited to the third in  Montreal, but I didn't have the money to go  and it was difficult to get funding. So that's  what I do in between writing."  There is tremendous support for literature in Norway. Authors are not only paid a  royalty for books purchased at bookstores,  but also get royalties from the state for  books checked out of libraries.  "We are concerned with preserving our  language in these times of strong English influence, especially American English." Brantengerg said. "We have what's  called the purchase scheme for Norwegian  literature. It's a system whereby authorities  buy a thousand copies of every work of fiction published in Norway and give it to the  libraries. This is only for Norwegian books,  not translations. It's a conscious effort to  maintain and preserve our culture. We borrow so much from English and German—  it's hopeless."  Although Norwegian, Swedish and Danish are all mutually intelligible languages—  about as different from one another as  the English spoken in Dublin, Ireland and  Atlanta, Georgia—Brantenberg says very  few Scandinavians read literature from the  other countries.  "It's amazing how little the general public reads of the contemporary literature  from the other nordic countries," she says.  "Most of it isn't translated between the languages and people in general find it troublesome to read Danish or Swedish. It's too  much of an effort. Almost all the words are  spelled differently, even though they're similar."  Brantenberg believes that the most successful writers in Norway in the last ten  years have been women writers, in terms  of sales and quality. She thinks what distinguished women's writing, what makes it  more interesting, is that women often write  about what happens to them, whereas men  write about what they do.  "Women's writing is problematic if you  think of the old Aristotelian ideal of a  drama or a piece of literature where there's  a beginning, a middle and an end, and  where there must be some kind of working  towards a climax," said Brantenberg. "The  classic story would be of the hero who goes  out to kill the dragon. The protagonist sets  out, kills the monster and wins the kingdom  and the princess.  "Whereas we, as women, would write  about the princess waiting for the hero. And  in the end when they get married perhaps  it turns out that he's horrible to her. We  would then have to describe the waiting,  which is a passive thing, and the horrible  things that are done to her, or they way  experiences not being allowed to go out and  kill the dragon herself. And this makes for  quite another aesthetic. You can't say that  it must have a beginning, a middle and an  end. The model for making that kind of literature doesn't work for women."  Norway may not be very different from  North America in many respects, but the  differences are telling. Gerd Brantenberg is  an example of a literature English speakers  often don't have access to, a world of expression and experience beyond our cultural  boundaries.  Brantenberg's books in English include  What Comes Naturally (The Women's  Press (U.K.) 1986), Egalia's Daughters  Seal Press (USA) 1986) and the forthcoming To The Four Winds (Seal Press 1992).

It's never been hard to  find new books to review. On the rare occasions when I couldn't find inspiration at  the Vancouver Women's Bookstore or Ariel  Books, the SF shelves at various branches  of the public library held what I was looking for.  Since I've decided to take a break from  reviewing, I thought I'd look back at the  books that most impressed me, the ones I  recommend without reservation.  caustic humour. Chest hair on young men  (who are called "lordies") for example, is  something to be lamented and the author  actually comes up with a mandatory fashion item approximately analagous to the  brassiere which constrains and embarrasses  the males who wear it.  But the book is not a simple role reversal story; the females are not "just like  men" and they have good reasons for restricting males. By standing sexism on its  head, Egalia's Daughters is an extremely  powerful statement about oppression based  on gender. (See page opposite for more  on Gerd Brantenberg).  Benefits   by   Zoe   Fairbairns   (Virago  /N^O>Y\££  A Door Into Ocean by Joan Slon-  czewski (Avon Books, 1987) was one of  those wonderful surprises, a totally engrossing and richly-layered book by a new author. Using the SF convention of the alien  who is more like us than the "humans,"  Slonczewski creates an ocean world inhabited by mauve-skinned women who live in  harmony with each other and the creatures of the air and sea. Her Sharers have  no words for give or take or pay or sell;  they "share knowledge" rather than learn  or teach, they "share words" rather than  speak or listen.  Violence is incomprehensible to them and  they look askance at the habits of the people of the central planet who "deliberately  share physical injury" among themselves  and with the Sharers. But these women are  also sophisticated scientists and expert anarchist communitarians. So in addition to  drawing me into the beauty of their lives,  the book left me with many thoughts about  the courage and resilience of people when  they share a common history and commitment to the future.  Another book that took my breath away  was Egalia's Daughters by Gert Brantenberg (The Seal Press, Seattle, 1985). A  satire about gender roles, the story takes  place in Egalia where women are dominant  both in the home and in public. Various  aspects of the society are caricatured with  WOKLttf  Press, London) was published in 1979. It's  classic feminist SF, written to explore the  potential of sexism to create an increasingly nightmarish world. The setting is England in the not-too-distant future. The primary solution for the financial woes of the  country is the consolidation of all government benefits (unemployment, welfare) into  a single maternal benefit in order to remove  women from the paid labour force, increase  the birth rate and "restore dignity to the  men."  What held me in a kind of terrible  fascination is that the Family Party, the  social/political organization established to  promote public acceptance of the new program sounded so much like REAL Women:  "Families should be the cement of the nation; women should be the cement of the  families." Struggling against the ravages of  this punitive policy are The Women, old and  new feminists who have built a movement  that is rooted in communities throughout  the nation, ready to support a counterattack. Fairbairns describes the process of  change in the women and their movement  as they hang in for the long haul.  Another of the books that tells the story  of a society rigidly structured by gender  is Native Tongue by Suzy Haden Elgin  (Daw Books, 1984). The special twist to this  book is that the author is a linguist, and  the power of language is a central theme.  lOctnetv  Milcirw -frips -for \£vrv&y -\o exft&m-*  ■$&£ -ttv^ £af-VH., plAy Aa& W#U  \J3<2, afa- offerma   acforrxm'&ieQ -far Oorte*.

How they decide when the time is right to  bring their language to life by beginning to  speak it is engrossing reading for anyone  who has ever had an opinion about political  strategy.  HI were ranking books, I would have to  put Ursula Le Guin's at the top. She's a  writer whose new books I anticipate with  great excitement and I've never been disappointed. Her most recent major work, Always Coming Home (Harper and Row,  1985) was nothing like her previous ones.  Not at all a conventional novel, it's a kind  of anthropological account of the Kesh, a  peaceful people who live in northern California in a future following a devastating nuclear war. The picture of this laid-back culture is elaborated slowly and lovingly with  lots of complexities and many surprises.  A collection of short stories by Le  Guin was also published recently. Buf-  falo Gals and Other Animal Presences  (New American Library, 1987) is filled with  treasures, including "May's Lion " which  provides a window into the author's process when she conceived Always Coming  Home. Le Guin tells the story twice, first  as it "really" happened and then as it would  happen among the Kesh. Writing the story  solved a problem for Le Guin, the writer;  reading it reinforced my belief that her people and places have lives of their own.  The Woman Who Loved the Moon  (Berkeley Books, 1981) is the last book by  Elizabeth Lynn I've been able to find. This  wonderful writer is especially good at combining imaginative stories about adventurous heroines with fine, down-to-earth detail. "The Woman Who Loved the Moon"  is the title story in this collection of several  fine-tuned pieces about women living simple lives or going on solemn missions. Look  for this one or The Chronicles of Tornor,  a three book saga written in 1978.  Another great adventure writer is Jo  Clayton who produces a steady stream  of novels. She has a series about Skeen  (Skeen's Leap, Skeen's Return, Skeen's  Search, Daw, 1985-87), a typical brash and  breezy heroine. Set far into the future when  space travel involves leaps through time,  Clayton's books are always fun to read. Her  female characters are particularly wonderful and rarely daunted. Sometimes, that's  just the kind of inspiration I need.  One of the special experiences I had  with this column was the opportunity to  meet Eileen Kernaghan, a Burnaby writer.  Eileen's books (Journey to Aprilioth Ace,  1980, Songs From the Drowned Lands  Ace Fantasy, 1983, and Sarsen Witch Ace,  1989) were the first fantasy books I read  that I really liked. Without getting into my  perception of the differences between SF  and fantasy, I'll just say that in Eileen's  books, magic emerges as a natural tool to  understand and cope with critical events.  Her women characters are warm and real  and often strong, but the presentation is not  a self-conscious message about sexism.  In Kernaghan's hands—as with Le Guin,  Clayton and Elizabeth Lynn—women appear alongside men as women complete in  themselves, in control of their own destinies.  Well, this is harder than I thought it  would be. To talk about my favourites and  leave out Jacqueline Lichtenberg's outrageous novels about symbiotic alien races or  Jody Scott's vampire series doesn't seem  reasonable. I'll just finish with a plug for  Women's Press ("steaming along") in England, a regular and reliable source of new  feminist SF. Happy reading and don't be  embarrassed by the covers.  KINESIS .****sss^5**^***^^^  Arts  H  one  by Donna Dykeman  In the midst of a continuing big-band  world-beat boom, the 13th Annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival offers something of  an acoustic oasis. Think of it as a weekend to stretch your wits and move your  imagination—and your feet won't be disappointed.  That's not to say there won't be anything  to rock your chair. Anyone who's already  heard the four women of Seattle's Ranch  Romance will vouch for the irresistible energy of their acoustic rockabilly and harmony yodelling. Also on the swing bill are  the virtuoso bluegrass of Laurie Lewis and  Grant Street and the new-grass sounds of  Kathy Kallick and the Good 01' Persons.  This year's theme of traditional music  from Veracruz state, Mexico and Italy, plus  a small but diverse array of bands from Aus-  •^t Top left: Mary Carter Smith, Griot.  Top right: Ranch Romance.  Bottom: Brenda Wong Aoki.  .  Bott  tralia, Bulgaria, Latin America and the UI  should also keep the dance beat rolling.  Most intriguing to me in this festival lineup is the storytelling program. I've always  been hooked on words, especially women's  words, whether written, sung, spoken or  shouted, and this year promises a feast  of them. Comic Sheila Gostick is bringing  her rapid-fire originality to meet up with  the feminist comedy of Kate Clinton. Together, these women demonstrate the political power of humour that jabs us in the ribs  and the funny-bone at the same time.  Also appearing is Melanie Ray, who many  of us know and love from her work as part  of Wives Tales Storytellers. And from Baltimore comes Mary Carter Smith, Griot, the  only such official in the United States. A  griot is a French West African word meaning storyteller, living historian, and poet—  the link between the cultural past and  present. Smith continues this tradition to  promote peace and understanding between  all peoples of the world, and to pass on the  African-American heritage to new generations.  New directions in storytelling are represented by the riveting work of Brenda Wong  Aoki who combines traditional Japanese  /^^^^m^^^^m^^SS^  ^//////////////////^^^  theatrical forms and Asian mythological  imagery with feminist and contemporary  Asian-American themes. Pushing the program all the way into performance art are  the Frank Chickens, two women from Japan  and the UK who bring their own unique  mixture of song, poetry and social satire.  As for the singers, I'm looking forward  to the whole eclectic and powerful group  of them. Folk legend Rosalie Sorrels brings  us stories of the strength and endurance  of women's lives through her intensely personal songs. Danielle Villiere, a full-time  trade unionist from Ardennes, France, is using her vacation to bring us songs of French  history and activism. Jeanne Bichevskaya  contributes a distinctive voice of traditional  and contemporary song from the USSR, and  Guadalupe Urbina brings her dedication to  the rights and identity of the Central American people through the popular music and  poetry of Costa Rica,  England's The Waterdaughters offer a  cappella versions of that country's traditional songs, while Washington's Holly Graham focuses on topical satire and music for  children. Music with a feminist/lesbian edge  will arrive with the varied stylings of Holly  Near, Faith Nolan, Deirdre McCalla and  new-kid-on-the-block Jennifer Berezan. On  the festival's instrumental side of things are  Teresa Ohnishi on koto, Kathryn Tickell  Northumbrian pipes, and Xiao Yu on pipa,  a four-stringed Chinese lute.  For more information on these artists  or the many others appearing July 13,  14 and 15 at Jericho Beach, contact the  Vancouver Folk Music Festival, 3271  Main St., 879-2931.  LETTERS  Out of context  Thank you to Terrie Hamazaki and Kinesis for the article, "Repairing ourselves and  the world"(Kinesis, May 1990). Your time and effort are appreciated.  We feel, however, that we must comment on an aspect of the presentation. In the article  the question "Are you going to be the only woman of colour in a group of Jews or the only  Jew in a group of women of colour?" was removed from context and offset in bold-face.  Removal from context changed what had been a rhetorical question intended to acknowledge the special difficulties encountered by Jewish women of colour into a sort of challenge  and a question inappropriate for white women to ask.  We would appreciate publication of this letter s  possible misunderstandings.  Devorah Greenberg  Silva Tenenbein  Vancouver, B.C.  that it may, in some degree, correct  Hormones no joke  To Kathy Tait, Province newspaper,  Re: "Raging Hormones"  I want you to know, as someone whose area of professional interest and research is normal changes in hormones and their affects on women's symptoms and functioning in daily  life, that I found your article in the April 1, 1990 Sunday issue of the Province extremely  offensive.  I am sure that you meant to be light-hearted and humorous. But the reality of what you  wrote is not a joke. I feel that the only reason your editors allowed you to publish this article is because it reflects an underlying view of women as sick, and a feeling that whenever  we are angry or upset this must be explained by hormones rather than by the situations  of our Hves.  I think the Province has an obligation to provide equal space for an equally eye-catching  and scientifically valid report about the reality of female hormones.  Jerilyn C.
