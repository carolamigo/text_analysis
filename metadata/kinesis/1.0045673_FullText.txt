Valuing women's work 3  I Minim HRI  * * III  Women organizing in Korea..  Making DAWN 16  JULY/AUGUST 1999  KINESIS As Kinesis goes to press, it's almost July.  While the heat rises in other parts of the  country, there are huge grey clouds over  Vancouver. Tiny stabs of chilly rain fall on  jacketed passers-by outside our windows.  During a conversation with an anti-male  violence frontline worker, we hear how  women have been showing up at work  wearing gloves. This ain't summer!  More on the weather. In The Province  newspaper, there was a story in June about  women who are struggling to get the landlord of their building to turn on the heat  because their children, especially the babies, are too cold to sleep. No, there'll be  no heat, says Mr. Slumlord, because he's  too hot at night.  Eventually, a poll of tenants is taken.  The score? Mostly women and children, too  cold; mostly men, too hot. Conclusion? The  heat stays off. The women fight on...a losing battle, really, because it would be unjust (!) if the needs of shivering babies takes  precedence over those of the sweaty, beefy  fellows next door or the hydro-cost-cutting  needs of the landlord.  Another weather vignette: in passing,  we learnt that 1998 was the hottest year in  four centuries!  Yes, the weather is a preoccupation this  month....but there are some other items that  grabbed our attention in the last moments  as the paper was getting prepped for the  presses.  ...Like the good news from Mexico  (...where it is hot.) In keeping with the demands of the hundreds of thousands of  women represented through their women's  reps at the world conference on women in  Beijing in '95...Mexico will count women's  unpaid (home/domestic) work in the next  census. The census will also take into account contributions made by family members (mostly women) towards care of members of the family with physically disabilities.  According to a study of 20 million  households in Mexico, this should affect  some four million households with family  members who have physical disabilities.  The census will also count the contributions  towards Mexico's national economy made  by 42.2 million people who perform unpaid  domestic work, about 92.3 percent of whom  (no surprise) are women!  ...Like the inspiring visit recently to  Canada by Dr. Ellen Kornegay, of the Office of the Status of Women (OSW) in South  Africa. Kornegay, a longtime activist for  women's and African liberation in South  Africa and in the USA and a former social  worker, now works at the OSW which is  housed in Thabo Mbeki's office, that is, in  the offices of the president of South Africa.  The OSW has a key role in formulating and  vetting policies for gender components,  and no ministry in South Africa, federal or  provincial, can slip sexist policies by the  OSW. Well, in theory, at least.  We were unable to interview Kornegay  for time reasons, but we'll tell you what we  know. Kornegay was on a cross-Canada  tour of meetings with government types to  discuss women's equality measures that  might work in the South African context.  During her stop in Vancouver, a small  group of women's organization reps (two)  and Aboriginal women (three) met  Kornegay at the Status of Women Canada  office. We talked to her about what we think  works and what doesn't. A startlingly honest general discussion ensued.  Among observations...It's becoming  more and more apparent that the Canadian  independent women's movement(s) have  been seriously co-opted and sidetracked in  our struggle for women's liberation. Despite huge gains over the last 25 years, the  best laid out plans have gone awry.  For example, BC now has the only surviving stand-alone women's ministry in the  country (until the NDP get voted out next  Spring). Yet BC women are struggling  against similar opporessive policies that the  previous Social Credit governments had  had in place—but now our opponents are  NDPers.  Our appreciation to the following supporters who became members of VSW, renewed  their memberships or subscriptions to Kinesis, or who made donations during the months  of May and June.  Melanie Conn * Sharon Costello * Barbara Curran * Sharon Goldberg * Dorothy  Kidd * Gail Ployer * Rosemarie Rupps * Esther Shannon * Jean Swanson * Rita Wong  * RMD Productions * Surrey Teachers Association  A special thanks to our donors who give every month. Monthly donations assist  VSW in establishing a reliable funding base to carry out our programs, services and Kinesis throughout the years. Thanks to:  Helen Babalos * Wendy Baker * Merlin Beltain * Jody Gordon * Erin Graham * Tamara  Knox * Linda Shuto * Shelagh Wilson  CORRECTIONS  Oops, we must stand corrected. Last month, in our interview with Yue-Qing Yang, the  director of Nu Shu: a hidden language of women in China [page 14,] we inaccurately stated  that Nu Shu was used exclusively by "Yao" women. Nu Shu was also used by other  women in the region, including Han Chinese women.  Kornegay talked about the structures  her country has put in place to work towards women's liberation (which is linked  to the liberation of all peoples in her enviably politically literate country). Three  years after South Africa held its first ever  multiracial political elections, the OSW was  set up as the apex of a network of other  "gender equality" measures. [Ed. Note: The  term/notion of gender equality is preferred by  many South African women because, among  other reasons, the notion of "women's" equality could invite unnecessary male opposition  on grounds that women are being divisive at a  time when Africans and other progressives need  to come together and not get distracted from  the greater goals of the day].  Setting up the OSW was chosen over  the option of having yet another ministry  focused on women's issues, which ran the  risk of women's issues being ghettoized  and seen as separate from the key issues of  the day—male violence, housing and other  re-allocation of resources issues. And so in  1997, the OSW set up shop within the Office of the Deputy President's Office.  But now, with President Mandela gone  and Deputy President Mbeki leading the  country, the OSW finds itself at the nub of  the high-powered happenings in that country. [Ed note: And with Mandela gone, the focus has somewhat shifted from reconciliation  (and placating the white population) to rebuilding the country and effecting changes that Africans have already waited too long for.]  Most powerful in our meeting with  Kornegay was the connection forged between herself and the Aboriginal women  present. For example, in South Africa, how  to affect progressive change politically  when you still must contend with an overwhelmingly white Afrikaner bureaucracy?  In Canada, how to build up a community  that is still colonized and controlled by the  Apartheid-inspiring Indian Act?  In the end, what stood out was the feeling that while South African women energetically and creatively act to take advantage of a still-strong political will for social  change, Canadian women barely struggle  to stay alive as a political and social force.  Depressing? Yes.  But meeting Kornegay was inspiring  too. It impresses upon us a need to continue  to try to think creatively, rethink, and/or  throw out what works and what doesn't in  the women's movement, rather than stubbornly clinging to what used to work...and  damn it, will, if we only just keep at it  It impresses upon us a need to challenge ourselves and honestly answer the  question, "What is women's liberation and  do I really want it? Do I have what it takes  to get it?"  One quick announcement as we go to  press: Composer/pianist (Torontorian and  Sagittarian) Lee Pui Ming will launch her  4th recording, Taklamakan, with a multi-media concert in Vancouver (at the Roundhouse) on July 20, and in Toronto on July  24. The concert will feature three Mongolian performers. For details, call Ellie O'Day  at (604) 731-3339 or the Roundhouse.  As Kinesis goes to press, we end by  wishing you a good (warm) summer and  plenty of opportunities to find and express  your womanpower. Let yourselves shine  and ...what the hell, do something to liberate yourself. Live big! And enjoy, if you can!  Well, the first day of summer has come  and gone and you may be wondering how  the hard-working yet party-crazy gang at  Kinesis celebrated this momentous occasion. Beware! The answer may disappoint  you! Yes, the rumours you heard were true.  Like many others in Vancouver, we  celebrated the summer solstice by taking  cover from the rain and asking ourselves,  and each other, some soul-searching questions, such as: where is that damn sun? will  it ever stop raining? is it really time for production again, and of course, that most frequent of dilemmas: what should we write  in Inside Kinesis this time?  Despite the foul weather that replaced  some much needed sunshine, we managed  to keep the creative fires burning within the  mango-hued walls of our production room,  with the help of some fabulous volunteers.  Speaking of volunteers, the Kinesis team  wants to congratulate Lissa Geller [a member of our editorial board and general all-  around super volunteer] on the newest addition to her family, baby William. Congrats  to Lissa, Tracey, David, Joey, and a huge  welcome to William, the newest~not to  mention, youngest-member of the Kinesis  team. (Just kidding!)  But while we're on the subject of volunteers, we want to thank all the dedicated  women who came in to help us out with  our July/August issue. We'd also like to  welcome new writers Eun-ju Heo (who  came all the way from Korea to write an  article for us [see page 8]), and Shelagh Smith  [see page 10.]  For all you aspiring Kinesis editors,  don't forget that we're still accepting ap  plications for this position till August 16.  The job does involve a lot of hard work,  but it's also a really great opportunity! We  look forward to receiving applications from  as many women as possible [see the job posting on page 21.].  From reading the last few instalments  of Inside Kinesis, you may have gotten the  impression that all we do is party and eat.  Okay, it's true, but this time around we did  a few other exciting things too. July saw  the official launch of what we hope become  a long standing Kinesis tradition: our first  clothes swap. Thanks to Monica and  Bernadette for bringing in some truly  snazzy items... The women of Kinesis are  always in style!  Speaking of stylish, absolutely stunning, fabulous... we're talking about the  just-launched Kinesis subscription drive  campaign, complete with lovely lime green  brochures. We sent out 1,500 pieces to potential individual subscribers and 1,000  pieces to potential institutional subscribers.  And now, we're waiting... A huge thank you  to leanne Johnson—the genius behind this  operation—for being a great sub-drive coordinator!  Let's see, what else did we want to tell  you! Oh yes, Kinesis will be closed for the  month of July... time to give our hard working crew a break and a chance to go in  search of some of that elusive sunshine.  We'll be back in production for our September issue from August 17-22. Our next story  meetings will be August 3rd and September 7th at 7:00pm at our office.  Until then, we hope you have a great  summer.  SIS  JULY/AUGUST 1999 News  A new resource manual on women and unpaid work:  Expanding our notions  by Agnes Huang  A new all-in-one handbook for anyone  and everyone interested in getting a better  handle on unpaid work has just been published.  The When Women Count Resource  Manual is the product of more than three  years of compiling and writing, and many  more years of researching and organizing,  by Mothers Are Women. MAW is an activist organization based in Ottawa and operated out of the homes of a few of its members. (MAW does not receive any ongoing  funding support. For this resource manual,  the group received grant monies from Status of Women Canada.)  The inspiration for the manual came  out of a desire to broaden the debate, and  to encourage women to become active and  make connections in their own lives to unpaid work issues, says Evelyn Drescher, a  spokesperson for MAW. "So many women  out there aren't active or don't think they're  active. We produced this manual so they'd  know they can do it too."  Women involved with MAW wanted  the manual to encompass the broad range  of issues related to unpaid work so that  others would not have to go through the  four, five year process it took them to get  to their current place of understanding.  With that said, Drescher admits that, although the manual extends more than 250  pages, it does not provide in-depth coverage of all the issues.  The goal of When Women Count is to  deepen the collective understanding that  the issue of unpaid work is more than just  taxes and the "mommy wars." Says  Drescher: "The question of allocation and  reallocation of resources in a society is an  issue of economic rights and economic justice that goes beyond the tax system." In  fact, unpaid work should be seen in the  context of the environment, economic restructuring, volunteering at a rape crisis  centre, breastfeeding, elder care, globalization, farming, and so on.  Expanding the public's notion of what  counts as unpaid work—pushing them to  think beyond the traditional image of "the  homemaker"—is critical, Drescher adds.  This is particularly relevant given the recent focus in the media and by the Reform  Party in the House of Commons on tax  breaks for "single-income" families—read:  "stay-at-home" moms versus "working"  moms.  In response, Finance Minister Paul  Martin called together a multi-party Sub-  Committee on Tax Equity for Families with  Dependent Children. The subcommittee  handed its report over to the federal Finance  Committee on June 14, a week before the  House recessed for the summer.  For its part, MAW says what is needed  is a comprehensive and progressive family  policy that addresses a gamut of ways governments can support families (families  defined in a broad sense). Such measures  would include adequate maternity and parental leave, accurate measuring of unpaid  work and caregiving, and ensuring that any  pension benefits are directed towards the  caregiver. As well, Drescher says more  money should be allocated to the federal  Women's Program, which provides funding to women's organizations, to encourage women's groups to continue working  on this issue.  In the meantime, MAW is focusing its  attention on the 2001 Census, trying to ensure that there continues to be some recognition of unpaid work. MAW has a great  stake in the Census, as it played a critical  role in lobbying the federal government to  add questions about unpaid work in the  1996 Census.  Towards that goal, MAW published  eight editions of The Kitchen Table Revolution newsletter between 1994 to 1996. Although geared specifically towards the  Census, it also focused on a general exploration of the issue of unpaid work. Then,  in 1996, MAW prepared a "Getting  Counted" kit to help more people understand the usefulness of questions in the  Census on unpaid work.  While women's groups were successful in getting some recognition for unpaid  see WORK next page  Counting women in  The When Women Count Resource Manual was produced to help  the reader understand the issue of unpaid work more completely. It was compiled by women involved with Mothers  Are Women. The manual is part of a  work in progress—MAW recognizes  that the issue and understanding of unpaid work are ever-evolving.  Section I explores the politics of unpaid work, and speaks to the injustice of  keeping unpaid work uncounted. Section  II spells out how to facilitate the "When  Women Count Workshop" created by  MAW. Section III focuses on activism  and explains different types of involvement in the movement to count and  value unpaid work. And finally, Section  IV contains a list of resources.  Here, is an excerpt from the introduction of the manual.  By opening the When Women  Count Resource Manual, you have  embarked on a further exploration of  unpaid work. This resource manual  is another piece of an ongoing discus  sion. Far from being the "definitive  word" on unpaid work, this document  represents a continuation of the debate  about unpaid work, and is another step  in the process of getting all work recognized.  The When Women Count Resource  Manual is fundamentally a public education document. It is meant to provide  you with information, and a place to  begin your own discussion about unpaid work. It will also be used as a lobbying tool, to continue to persuade  statisticians, economists, and policy  makers of the importance of counting  and valuing unpaid work.  The unpaid work movement is a  collection of people around the world  demanding recognition for the unpaid  work that holds the world together. It  represents thousands of people, mostly  women, doing millions of hours worth  billions of dollars of work in caring for  and feeding people—and doing this  work in virtual obscurity, often not  even able to eat the food they grow.  The unpaid work movement can  trace its roots back to the late 1800s,  when women began to connect their  fight for equality with the work they  did. That connection rings true today,  as the demand for recognition of unpaid work is made on the grounds of  basic human rights. In between then  and now, there have been a number of  memorable moments. The moment in  1991 when Carol Lees refused to agree  with the Canadian census that she "did  not work" simply because she was not  paid for her work. Moments when  unpaid work gained recognition as a  feminist issue. The moment when  Selma James declared that justice  would come in the form of wages for  housework. The moment when  Marilyn Waring's writing exposed the  global economic system as unfair to  women. These are all snapshots that  document a continuing process.  In 1996, a coalition of individuals  and groups successfully lobbied Statistics Canada to include three ques  tions about unpaid work on the Canadian Census of Population. Those  questions attempted to measure  some of the unpaid work done in the  home, in caring for children, and in  caring for elders.  [The When Women Count Resource  Manual] takes "another step:" the  next step after the '96 Census, the step  before Beijing +5 [the follow-up conference to the 4th World Conference  on Women held in September 1995]  and the 2001 Census. [It is] a building block of the unpaid work movement that has made this important  issue a matter of human rights and  international concern.  The cost of the manual is $20 for  members of MAW, and $30 for non-  members.

JULY/AUGUST 1999  SIS News  Women and abortion rights in Canada:  Anti-truth advertising  by Joyce Arthur  A group called "Pro-Life BC" is currently sponsoring several ads on local TV  that try to persuade pregnant women to  carry their pregnancies to term. Although  these slick ads are subtle and reasonably  tasteful, they represent the snowy-white tip  of a very large and dirty iceberg. Most anti-  choice propaganda uses misinformation  and fear-mongering to dissuade women  from having abortions.  More typical of anti-choice advertising  is a recent 12-page insert in a Pitt Meadows community newspaper. This insert is  very similar to others that have appeared  in community newspapers over the years-  -they all contain the same twisted mass of  misinformation. It would take a book to  adequately refute the many errors in these  ads, but let me address three of the most  dangerous ones.  First, the anti-choice ads claim that  abortion greatly increases the risk of breast  cancer Most scientific studies show no such  link. The anti-choicers rely on one or two  flawed studies to make their claim, and  deliberately ignore evidence contrary to  their position. Many independent experts,  including the Canadian Cancer Society,  have concluded that a link between abortion and breast cancer has not been established.  Even if a link did exist, it would be so  miniscule as to be statistically insignificant.  The anti-choicers are shedding crocodile  tears over the issue of breast cancer, because  if they had any real concern for women,  they would not bully them with false and  threatening scare tactics.  Second, the anti-choice ads claim that  abortion is physically risky for women, often resulting in serious complications, such  as hemorrhage, perforation of the uterus or  bowel, and a future risk of infertility or  problem pregnancies. In reality, abortion is  one of the simplest and safest medical procedures of all. In Canada, the maternal  death rate for abortion is 0.1 per 100,000  procedures. Complications occur in about  1 percent of patients, the majority of them  minor, such as fever or abdominal pain.  Safe, early abortion has no effect on a  woman's future ability to bear a healthy  child. In contrast, in countries where abortion is illegal and unsafe, the maternal  death rate for early abortion is 330 deaths  per 100,000 procedures, and the rate of  complications averages 25 percent, most of  them severe, such as infertility or sepsis (a  serious infection.)  When a very rare maternal death from  abortion occurs in NorthAmerica, the anti-  choicers shed another flood of crocodile  tears for women, publicizing it as an example of the dangers of abortion. Meanwhile, their proposed solution, illegal abortion, is one of the most efficient woman-  killing machines ever invented.  Third, the anti-choice ads claim that  abortion causes "post-abortion syndrome,"  a condition characterized by serious and  chronic psychological side-effects, including guilt, rage, nightmares, and sexual dysfunction. There is no such disorder. Most  women feel primarily relief and happiness  after their abortion, and never regret their  decision. Any negative emotions that  women experience tend to be mild and temporary, and often stem from the unwanted  pregnancy itself, not the abortion.  On rare occasions, some women do.  suffer chronic emotional after-effects from  their abortion, but this is usually linked to  other factors, such as previous psychiatric  problems or a coerced abortion decision.  Ironically, new mothers are much more  likely to suffer serious psychological effects,  such as post-partum depression.  When women do have some emotional  problems with their abortion decision,  what's really the root cause? The depiction  of abortion as an immoral, shameful, and  guilt-ridden activity has been honed to a  fine art by the anti-choicers. Women who  arrive at abortion clinics are often surprised  at the professional, compassionate care they  receive. Apparently, they expect second-  rate care, and an atmosphere of disapproval. That's because the public well has  been poisoned by years of relentless anti-  choice propaganda.  Various anti-choice agencies advertise  that they help pregnant women in distress.  But most, like Crisis Pregnancy Centres, do  not make referrals for abortions, instead  they give out false information on abortion, and instill anxiety and guilt for a decision to have an abortion. Some Christian  counselling agencies claim to help vulnerable women who are troubled by a past  abortion. Usually, they try to convince the  woman that she murdered her own baby,  then teach her to somehow forgive herself.  Needless to say, such wounds may never  heal.  The next time you see or read a "pro-  life" advertisement, question the accuracy  of every image and every word. Don't be  swayed by a superficial, caring exterior, and  don't be fooled by crocodile tears for  women. The anti-choice agenda is profoundly anti-woman, even anti-child. Because if they really cared about babies, they  would care about mothers just as much.  Their supposed concern for the fetus disguises a lack of respect for all women, especially those who insist on controlling  their own bodies and lives.  Joyce Arthur is a spokesperson for the Pro-  Choice Action Network, and edits their newsletter, Pro-Choice Press. PC AN can be reached  at http://www.prochoiceconnection.com/pro-  can)  from WORK previous page  work in the Census, the questions included  were restricted to just three areas: household work, child care and elder care. Now,  Drescher says, activism is needed to even  keep those three questions on unpaid work  in the 2001 Census—the Liberal government has not confirmed it will not pull  them.  She adds that because the government  is using the threat of dropping the questions altogether, MAW is unable to push for  further progress, such as the inclusion of  unpaid work in the Labour Market section  of the Census, or the recognition of volunteer work.  The Liberal government will decide on  the content of the next Census this Fall. So  far, Drescher says, MAW has only received  supportive letters from Hedy Fry, secretary  of state for the status of women, and Health  Minister Allan Rock. She adds it is important to gain the support from others ministers like Pierre Pettigrew, Human Resources  and Development Canada, and Finance  Minister Paul Martin.  MAW says that understanding the role  of unpaid work in the functioning of households, communities, the marketplace, and  national and global economies has critical  and far-reaching implications for social and  economic policy in Canada.  As an example, Drescher points to the  healthcare system. "In order to have a clear  understanding of the real value/cost of  healthcare, it is necessary to examine the  economic contribution of both the formal  (paid) and informal (unpaid) sectors to the  system," says Drescher. "Only then can effective social policy be made."  MAW is planning to raise the issue of  valuing and compensating unpaid work at  the Beijing +5 forum in New York next June.  [Beijing +5 is the follow-up meeting to the 4th  United Nations World Conference on Women  held in September 1995 in Beijing, China.]  Drescher notes that sorting out the issue of  compensation is important, but it is a different debate from valuation. As a baseline  though, no one should be penalized for  doing unpaid work. That, Drescher says,  includes being left vulnerable to poverty, a  situation many women find themselves in  particularly in their senior years.  MAW will use the Beijing +5 forum to  put pressure on the Canadian government  to honour its international commitments to  advance the status of women. The forum  will also allow women's groups to stress  the clear links between unpaid work and  globalization, and to other issues such as  migrant labour.  Another project MAW is undertaking  is to compile its Kitchen Table Revolution  newsletters into one book, with an updated  editorial.

That statement  from Louise Riendeau was a sentiment expressed by feminists across the country after the murder of Ginette Roger at a women's shelter in St-Jean sur Richelieu, Quebec (30 minutes south of Montreal).  Riendeau, the coordinator of Le  Regroupement provincial des maisons  d'hebergement et de transition pour  femmes victimes de violence conjugate, a  coalition of 48 women's shelters and transition houses in Quebec, says her organization had to put out a very clear message.  "We don't want women to feel afraid to use  women's shelters."  Ginette Roger left her husband, Marcel  Samson, and had been staying at Le Coup  d'Elle shelter for a month. Shortly before  3:00am on June 11, Samson showed up at  the shelter and kicked in the door. He asked  a staff member where his wife was and  when he didn't get the response he wanted,  he went looking for her. When he found  Ginette, he shot her seven times. He left the  shelter, and later turned himself over to police.  Earlier that morning, the house Roger  and Samson had shared for the past 20  years was set on fire; police suspect Samson  of the arson.  The media and reported public response to Roger's death focused on the "security" of transition houses and women's  shelters, rather than on the systemic problem of male violence against women. Questions raised highlighted what the shelter  could have (or should have) done to better  "protect" Roger—from steel doors to  alarms—and not the fact that the day before she was killed, Ginette Roger told the  staff at the shelter she did not feel safe returning home.  Eileen Morrow of the Ontario Association of Interval and Transition Houses  (OAITH) counters that the safety and security of women are taken very seriously  by transition houses and women's shelters.  "We work from women's experiences and  women's needs," says Morrow. "We encourage women if they are nervous to  speak to the shelter workers about the security measures.

She adds that if an abusive man wants  to assault or murder his wife or female partner, he is not likely to try anything at the  shelter "A lot of abusers are aware that shelters have high security, and their tendency  is to get the women out of the shelter," says  Morrow. "In over 20 years of shelters in  Canada, think of the hundreds of thousands  of women who have used them, without  incident." [In fact, before the murder of Ginette  Roger, there was only one other time a woman  has been killed in a women's shelter in Canada.]  Riendeau says that the solution isn't to  create walled compounds around women  who come to shelters. "We cannot make the  shelters into prisons. Women have to be  comfortable; it has to feel like their homes."  Instead, she says, the focus must be on  ending male violence against women. "We  make an appeal to everybody—individuals, institutions, governments—to end conjugal violence, to teach children not to respond with violence, to help victims make  their lives again, and to say 'no' when they  see violent behaviour."  The underlying issue of male violence  against women was certainly on the minds  of the more than 300 women from women's shelters across Quebec who converged  on St-Jean sur Richelieu for Ginette Roger 's funeral. They came to remember  Ginette and to make a declaration: Each  time a woman is killed, hurt or injured; it's  one of us who is killed, hurt or injured.  Ironically, just six days before Roger's  death, members of Le Regroupement voted  unanimously at the coalition's annual general meeting to press the provincial government to make ending violence against  women a priority and to increase funding  to women's shelters.  Le Regroupement estimates that each  transition house or shelter in Quebec needs  between $530,000 and $665,000 per year in  order to ensure quality services to women.  Currently, they operate on just half of that.  Women's shelters in Quebec haven't received any increases in funding since 1992,  and, in fact, have seen their budgets cut  over the years. These cuts have been  disasterous. Two shelters in Abitibi are facing closure because of their accumulated  deficits.  Le Regroupement points out that each  year, transition houses in Quebec offer shelter to more than 8,000 women and their  children. "Our shelters are always full. We  have a lot of work, good politics on paper,  but we don't have enough funding," says  Riendeau.  This critical need for women's shelters  was highlighted in a recent study by Statistics Canada, funded by Health Canada  The results of the survey on "Canada's  Shelters for Abused Women," released just  two days after Roger's death, showed that  in 1997-98, 90,792 women and dependent  children were admitted to 413 shelters for  battered women across Canada. In a snapshot taken on April 20, 1998, there were  5,115 residents in 422 shelters, 48 percent  were women and 52 percent were dependent children.  Back in St-Jean-Sur-Richelieu... because  the media attention on the murder of  Ginette Roger exposed the location of the  L'Coup d'Elle shelter, it will have to move.  "It's not possible to ensure good security  for women at this house anymore," says  Riendeau.  The mayor of the St-Jean sur Richelieu  has pledged to help with the fundraising.  However, it is not just the financial cost that  will be great. The emotional cost to the  women working and using the shelter will  also be enormous.  The Ontario Association of Interval and  Transition Houses has produced its own report  on the impact of funding cuts by Mike Harris  and the Conservatives on services for battered  women."Falling Through the Gap" is available on the Ontario Women's Justice Network  website at: www.web.net/~owjn/ or from  OAITH at (416) 977-6619.

Opened a year ago in an old house  near downtown Victoria, Bambino's was  envisioned as many things: a thrift store  that would provide a child-friendly option  for shopping, a cafe offering healthy snacks  and refreshments, and a resource centre for  neighbourhood parents [see Kinesis Ocfo-  ber 1998.]  Lori Snow, Navit Giauque, Gratia  Watson and Leah Orr—the four young  mothers who own and operate the business—have been working hard at honing  old and acquiring new skills.  The thrift store, Bambino's main source  of revenue and primary focus, continues to  provide much needed children's items at  affordable prices. The cafe has become a  place for neighbourhood parents to break  out of the isolation that parenting (especially low-income and/or single parenting)  often brings. The resource centre and library continue to grow and now contain  numerous books and magazines and a bulletin board with information on local events  and organizations.  For all their successes, there have also  been obstacles. For example, the Ministry  of Human Resources was very supportive  at first, even doing a case study on the endeavour early on. So far, all four members  are still receiving income assistance, but  there is concern that recent changes to the  welfare system will negatively impact on  the business. Two members are currently  working on getting their daycare subsidies  back. Because these two members are not  "working"—there is still not enough  money to pay the members wages—they  no longer qualify for daycare subsidies. But  there is optimism that Bambino's will soon  lead the women off the system to economic  independence.  Bambino's recently started selling  memberships to its customers, with a portion of the fee being put into a "Children's  Fund." This fund will be used to sponsor  children from low-income families to take  up extracurricular activities such as music,  sport or dance lessons that they would otherwise not be able to afford.  Community support has been key to  Bambino's success. Donations continue to  come through the door, and dedicated volunteers help to keep things in running order. Valuable advice has come from other  business owners and organizations in Victoria.  So remember: on Saturday, July 17th,  drop by and celebrate Bambino's anniversary. The festivities run from 10:00am to  4:00pm at 607 Vancouver St, Victoria. There  will be music, prizes, face-painting, food  and more. It is free and open to the public.

Canadian NGO  alternative report  The newly formed Feminist Alliance  for International Action (FAFIA) has taken  on the role of bringing together a Canadian  NGO (non-governmental organization) Alternative Report to take to the Beijing +5 special session of the United Nations (UN) next  June.  The report will be part of a global  document which will assess the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action  (PFA) adopted by national governments at  the 4th World Conference on Women in  September, 1995. The NGO Report will be  an alternative to the document presented  to the UN by the Canadian government. It  will be available for women to use in their  efforts to ensure commitments made internationally by Canada are honoured domestically.  The Canadian NGO Alternative Report  will be based on an integrated feminist  analysis. The analysis will recognize and  take into account the multiple and intersecting impacts of policies and practices on different groups of women because of their  race, class, ability/disability, sexual orientation, religion, culture, refugee or immigrant status, or other status. It links the  domestic and the international.  Over the course of the summer, FAFIA  will network with women's equality-seeking groups across Canada to gather infor  mation on how successfully (or unsuccessfully) the Beijing PFA has been implemented in Canada. FAFIA invites women's  groups to submit research or data that  might be critical in the development of the  report.  The Canadian NGO Alternative Report  will be released in February, and the global  report will be launched in New York two  days prior to the presentation of the UN's  Beijing +5 Report at the special session.  Submissions for the FAFIA report can be  sent to the Canadian Research Institute for the  Advancement of Women, 151 Slater St, Suite  408, Ottawa, Ontario, KIP 5H3; fax: (613)  563-0682.

To access information about Beijing +5 through the Internet,  visit the Global NGO Beijing +5 website at  http://www.womanaction.org  Young women and NAC  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women presents a newly formed  Young Women's Caucus.  This Caucus is committed to providing young women with a space where their  voices are validated, celebrated and honoured. Young women between 16-30 are  needed to unite, to learn from their grandmothers, to fight for today, and to pave a  smooth path for their daughters.  The goals for 1999/2000 include participating in the World March of Women in  the Year 2000, and organizing a Young  Women Unite II Conference. Also, there are  plans to start "chapters" across Canada, to  fundraise, and to work for leadership roles  within NAC.  For more information, contact Rachel at  (416) 755-9605 or thedivas@pathcom.com; or  Kelly at (905) 525-0629 or hwetl-  pr@interlynx.net.  The "colour of violence"  Organizing is well underway for a conference which will bring together activists  whose work challenges violence against  women of colour. The Color of Violence: Violence Against Women of Colour will take  place April 14 to 15,2000 at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, and will allow  participants opportunities to strategize  around the relationships among racism,  colonialism and gender violence in the lives  of women of colour. There will also be a  film festival on violence against women of  colour in conjunction with this conference.  Among the issues to be explored are  the ways in which modern capitalism is  constituted through the sexual exploitation  of women in the "Third World" and of  women of colour in the US, as evidenced  by the global trafficking of women and the  super-exploitation of female labour in multinational industries.  The conference will look at how the  media perpetuates the victimization of  women of colour by portraying them as  silent and powerless and by shutting them  out of the national discussions that affect  them. Take, for example, the narrow but  pervasive media messages surrounding the  O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson cases. In each  of these discussions, the perspectives of  women of colour were noticeably absent.  Other topics on the agenda include the  ways in which sexual and domestic violence operate in attacks on immigrants'  rights and Indian treaty rights, the proliferation of prisons, militarism, economic  neo-colonialism, and institutional racism.  The conference will also seek to  broaden the understanding of gender violence to include analyses of the ways in  which the bodies of women of colour have  been and continue to be colonized, especially through attacks on the reproductive  rights of women of colour, medical experimentation on communities of colour, and  bio-colonial attacks on indigenous communities through such projects as Human Genome Diversity Project.  The keynote presenters will be Angela  Davis, co-founder of Critical Resistance:  Beyond the Prison Industrial Complex, and  Haunani Kay Trask, an indigenous activist  and writer from Hawai'i.  Registration materials will be available in  October. There will be no charge to attend the  conference, but registration is limited.

This status allows the Vatican—the Roman Catholic Church—to take part in UN meetings  and conferences where it is typically  granted full status, including a vote on any  question put to a vote.  As the UN generally seeks consensus  rather than forcing issues to a vote, this allows dissenting voices a stronger presence  than they would normally have.  The power that the Vatican has due to  its status seriously impacts women's health  worldwide. The Holy See (the government  body of the Vatican) consistently tries to  limit women's access to family planning,  safe abortion, and emergency contraception, even for women who have been raped  as an act of war. The Vatican has also attempted to block international policy that  would promote condom use and education  as a tool in preventing HTV/AIDS.  "The time has come to challenge this  facade of the Vatican as a state," said  Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for  Free Choice (CFFC). "Why should an entity that is in essence 100 square miles of  office space and tourist attractions in the  middle of Rome with a citizenry that excludes women and children have a place  at the table where governments set policies  affecting the very survival of women and  children?"  Part of the campaign to remove the  Vatican's special status includes an international postcard campaign to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. This postcard  calls for an official review, and is designed  to create public awareness about the Vatican's position at the UN.  Hundreds of groups around the world  are endorsing the campaign, including  CFFC, Latin American and Caribbean  Women's Health Network, Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy, Women Living  Under Muslim Laws, Israel Women's Network, WomanHealth Philippines, Centre  for Health and Gender Equity (India), and  the National Organization for Women (US).  In Vancouver, British Columbia, local  groups are planning a press conference in July  to publicize the campaign.

Public inquiry into  Ontario elections  Although Mike Harris' Progressive  Conservative Party received a second mandate to govern the province of Ontario, the  elections themselves were shrouded in controversy and frustration. Many eligible voters faced serious difficulties in casting their  ballots, and a broad inquiry has been demanded by many, including the Ontario  Coalition for Social Justice (OCSJ), the New  Democratic Party—which lost official party  status in the legislature—and the Liberal  Party.  The main problems involved polling  clerks not showing up for work, ballot  boxes not being delivered, bomb threats to  polling stations, and difficulties of eligible  voters in placing their ballots as a result of  the recently implemented permanent voters' list. This list replaced the usual door-  to-door enumeration, and can make it more  difficult for some groups of people to be  able to vote.  The OCSJ says the new registration  system made it difficult for many tenants,  poor people, and those who recently turned  18, to get on the permanent voters' list.  The worst chaos of the day occurred  in the riding of Vaughan-King Aurora  where 220 poll clerks quit just before election day. Officials also said that many were  intimidated into not showing up.  In an attempt to improve the situation,  several polling stations were allowed to  remain open later than the rest. This caused  further frustration for those involved, as  results were publicized while voting continued. To make matters worse, Chief Electoral Officer Warren Bailie was unavailable  as he ran around trying to solve the ongoing problems of the election. Bailie has since  retired from his position.

Review of Canadian  Human Rights Act  The four-member panel given the responsibility of reviewing Canada's human  rights protection has announced it is now  operational.  In April, Minister of Justice Anne  McLellan announced the establishment of  a review panel which is composed of:  Gerard La Forest, a former justice of the  Supreme Court of Canada, as chair; Renee  Dupuis, a former commissioner oi the Canadian Human Rights Commission  (CHRC); Bill Black, a professor of law at  the University of British Columbia; and  Harish Jain, a professor of business at  McMaster University.  The review will examine and analyze  the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA)  and the policies and practices of the Commission. It will also address 1998 recommendations from the Auditor General that  the human rights system be made more effective in resolving allegations of discrimination.  The panel will review, among other  things: the prohibited grounds of discrimination, including the ground of "social condition" (not currently in the CHRA); the  scope and jurisdiction of the Act; the effectiveness of the current complaints-based  model; and the powers and procedures of  the CHRC and the human rights tribunal.  The panel will hold consultations in the  fall with the CHRC, employers, unions,  equality-seeking groups, non-governmental organizations, government departments, commission, crown corporations,  agencies, and other interested members of  the public.  A final report will be submitted to the  Minister of Justice with recommendations  by April 8,2000.

NWAC challenges  Bill C-49  Despite strong protests from Aboriginal women across the country, the Canadian Parliament and Senate recently passed  Bill C-49, which gives band councils power  to control land on reserves. In response, the  Native Women's Association of Canada  (NWAC) has launched a lawsuit against  Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart, saying that the new legislation does not protect the interests of Aboriginal women.  Bill C-49 gives 14 bands across the  country the power to expropriate land for  community use, and to decide on how  matrimonial land will be divided when  marriages fall apart. Many women fear that  band leaders, who are mostly male, will  pass laws that favour men.  NWAC argues that putting decisionmaking power in the hands of bands means  that women on some reserves could see  their matrimonial property rights diminish  after divorce. Aboriginal women on reserves are not covered by provincial laws  which would allow them to claim half of  the matrimonial properties.  Two years ago, the BC Native Women's Society launched its own constitutional  challenge against the federal government  precisely over the matter of the division of  matrimonial property rights. The Society  argues that the Indian Act discriminates  against Aboriginal women living on reserves on the basis of sex, ancestry, race,  marital status and/or place of origin.  In its lawsuit, the BCNWS also asked  the court to put an earlier version of Bill C-  49 on hold until the matter concerning  matrimonial property rights was settled.  [Then, the legislation was referred to Bill C-  75, the First Nations Land Management  Agreement.[The Society's case is still before  the federal court of Canada.  NWAC's own breach-of-duty lawsuit  alleges that Stewart and the federal government failed to protect Aboriginal women  by backing the contentious piece of legislation.  "There will be no national standards,  there will no consistency," says Marilyn  Buffalo, NWAC's president, "Women will  end up landless and there's no way to appeal. We're going into a new millennium  and Native women are the only women in  Canada who don't have protection."

In its unanimous decision, the Court said that appeal courts are  not entitled to overturn family court decisions simply because they would have  made a different judgement call in the particular case.  An appeal court can only overturn a  decision when there has been "an error in  principle, a significant misapprehension of  the evidence or unless the award is clearly  wrong."  This decision will be of interest to  women who find themselves in long court  battles with ex-partners who have a significantly greater financial ability to continue  the fight. In the decision Justice Claire  L'Hereux-Dube writes that the new ruling  "avoids giving parties an incentive to appeal judgements and incur added expenses  and promotes finality in family law litigation."  The decision is a victory for Patricia  Davis, a Winnipeg mother whose former  husband Walter Hickey appealed a family  court decision that increased his monthly  child support payments after his income  had doubled. The appeal court struck down  the initial increase in support payments.  Now that the SCC has agreed with Davis,  she will not have pay back the $14,400 she  owed after the appeal court retroactively  reduced her award.  Women can also look forward to a decision in the case of Thomas Baker, an Ontario millionaire whose support payments  were substantially increased according to  the new federal guidelines that tie support  to the income of the paying parent. The  Ontario Court of Appeal had upheld the  increase of the initial trial judge.  World's financial  centres occupied  Hundreds of thousands of people occupied and transformed about 100 major  financial districts in 40 countries on Friday,  June 18th in one of the largest coordinated  mass protests in recent history. The protests  were timed to coincide with the start of the  G-8 summit in Cologne, Germany. [The G-  8 is comprised of the eight wealthiest "First  World" nations in the world.]  The day of action, protest and carnival was held "in recognition that the global capitalist system based on the exploitation of people and the planet for the profit  of a few is at the very root of our social and  ecological troubles." At the top of the list  of protesters' demands was debt cancellation for the world's poorest countries.  The events were organized by a worldwide decentralized network of grassroots  activists. In Nigeria, the oil giants which  have wreaked havoc in the Niger Delta region were targeted. In Argentina, a procession through the streets of Buenos Aires  demanded debt cancellation for the world's  poorest countries. In England, protests by  about 4,000 people led to rioting and altercations with police. In Ottawa, a coalition  of groups took to the street to conduct  moral audits at the offices and locations of  corporations like Scotiabank and Shell.

The court told the federal government to change the law to allow off-reserve  voting within 18 months.

In some schools, there is a Women's Student Union (WSU). And in the case where  the WSU is run well and in really good condition, it is independent from the student  union.  I want to write about what the Women's Student Unions in Korea are doing.  First of all, the most important role for  a WSU is to represent women students.  Since women students are still discriminated against in many ways, we need a  powerful organization to be our representative, and also to be an asylum. One of the  main issues women students are dealing  with is sexual violence on campus, including rape.  Many WSUs send out surveys to students; for example, one might solicit opinions about beauty pageants. At my school,  we also publish a monthly newspaper  called Women's Opinion. In it, we sometimes  print the results of the surveys.  Another important role of the WSU is  education. We try to motivate students to  realize how bad the situation is for women  in Korea, both within school and outside  of it. At the same time, we also try to encourage students to participate in the movement and in matters related to women's organizations. We have many different kinds  of activities, like a campaign against sexist advertising, a women's  film festival, and different lectures. We also  hold a menstruation festival.  At the menstruation  festival, we highlighted  that menstruation is  something women  should be proud of.  Even though almost  every woman at some  point in her life menstruates, it is regarded as  dirty and as something  that shouldn't be talked  about in public. For example, in Korea, commercials on TV about  menstrual pads were  prohibited by law until  very recently. The reason  for prohibiting them was  because these commercials could make viewers "feel disgusted."  Even though this law has changed,  women still cannot speak out that they are  menstruating—it's still something that  shouldn't be mentioned by women in public. Women are made to feel shameful about  their bodies, unless their bodies are attracting men's attention.  That's why the menstruation festival  is not just about menstruation; it's also  about women's bodies. What we did in this  festival was try to encourage women students to reconsider their bodies. We  wanted to convince women students that  their bodies are something they should  take care of and be proud of.  To help get rid of the "men's" viewpoint from women students' minds, we  needed to use something really shocking  and that has been viewed as taboo. That's  why we picked menstruation. At this  festival,we had lectures about women's issues, showed films related to this topic, had  games, concerts, et cetera.  The final role of WSUs is to strengthen  solidarity between women students and  women out of school (especially women  estranged in the society, who are mostly  poor and don't have any social power).  Considering recent Korean history,  student unions have played an important  role for the liberalization of Korea during  the dictatorship after the Korean War [in  the 1950s.] WSUs are doing many things  which are more specific to all women than  the work of the universities' student unions.  For example, the Korean Student Union Organization holds a campaign called  NONGHWAL. Many students from the different universities go to the countryside  every growing season to help the farmers.  We stay there for about 10 days each time.  (It depends on how much work there is to  do.)  The student unions and Korean Farmers Association are strongly connected. We  believe we can build solidarity with farmers against the government's terrible policy  for farming. [There are no price guarantees  for food grown in Korea, so many farmers are  poor and are forced to go to the cities to find  work]  For this activity, WSUs prepare programs specifically for women farmers.  Women students work with the farmers in  the daytime. Afterwards, we invite the  women to the places where we're staying.  To be closer with the women farmers, we  call them mothers. We sometimes talk  about issues such as women farmers' double suffering—they can't even rest at home  after working because of all the domestic  chores they have to do, and the social programs, such as healthcare, for women farmers are much worse in the countryside than  in the cities.  Our favourite activity is giving them  massages. We feel really close to each other,  just like mother and daughter. We also  show them how to stretch their bodies after working long and hard.  Before going to the farms, we prepare  our activities and study up on some current issues concerning women farmers. It  takes a pretty long time, we usually start  preparing two months beforehand.  As another example, we organize  K1HWAL. Literally, KIHWAL means an activity at a brothel for the women there. After the Korean War, the US army stayed in  Korea. There are many brothels around  their bases, and the US army has stayed in  specific areas for a long time.  That's why there are lots of crimes  done by US soldiers around the bases. Most  of the crimes involve raping and killing  women in the brothels in very brutal ways.  There are also many children who don't  have fathers (actually their fathers must be  the soldiers).The children are exposed to  really terrible circumstances.  What we do is take care of the children,  and fight for the punishment of these rapists and murderers. Considering that the  criminal laws concerning military personnel were made just after the Korean War  by the Korean army and US army, it is safe  to say that Korea is still colonized militarily  by America.  For example, American soldiers cannot be punished through the Korean legal  system. Even though there have been many  protests against this for quite a long time,  many Korean women have been murdered  and the criminals haven't been punished.  We also try to let students in other parts  of Seoul know what's going on around the  US military bases, which the media has  never talked about. This is harder than any  other activity because we need to address  two issues at the same time: prostitution  and the US army. And prostitution is one  of the hardest issues to bring out to the student movement because of many conservative prejudices about it.  We have some difficulties in keeping  these various activities going. Some people say the situation for WSUs is getting  harder with the economic crisis in Korea.  However, there are still many students who  long for freedom and who are ready to fight  against the oppression of women. I have  never seen them tire of what they are doing. We are strong and sure that we can  change something. We are young.  For me, I couldn't help becoming more  interested in feminism since entering university. I expected complete freedom in my  school life. That's why I joined a group at  my university for studying social science  and for organizing the students around  current issues.  However, I was frustrated by the sexist discrimination. Many people in that  group think feminism is not something as  serious as other current political movements. Sometimes, I got really aggressive  when talking to them about anything related to feminism. I couldn't help it.  Fortunately at that time, I got to know  some women in a feminist group at my  school who helped me. I felt excited because they talked to me about the issues I  wanted to talk about, but couldn't actually  speak out on.  I started studying feminism and talking about it with pride. Gradually, I got to  know how to talk about feminism to the  people I had previously been angry with.  Now, each time I get angry when facing the  prejudices against women, I grab on to  hope with the people around me who are  striving for the same aim.  Eun-ju Heo is studying French at Hankuk  University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, South  Korea.  from NEWS previous page  port for Aboriginal people in Canada is directed to band councils, although many  Aboriginal people live off-reserve. Most of  these people are women and children—in  Vancouver, 48 percent of the women are single mothers.  These women, and off-reserve men,  have not been able to access the rights and  benefits afforded on-reserve Natives, ac  cording to Viola Thomas of the United Native Nations.  Off-reserve band members have been  excluded from their band's political process since 1951 when residency requirements were changed. Many people were  then denied votes even though they had  to leave their reserve due to lack of jobs  and housing shortages. "It's always been  a struggle of limited resources to meet the  needs of all their constituent members,"  says Thomas.  Although women are excited about the  decision and hope the country's band councils will accept it, there is concern that many  councils will continue to ban off-reserve  voting. The Assembly of First Nations issued a press release saying only aboriginal  leadership should decide "on the citizenship and membership of First Nations."  Even so, says Thomas, "It's a V for victory for off-reserve Indians in Canada. This  ruling says to the federal and provincial  governments, you can't ignore the needs  of the people who live off reserve."  [Sources: various emails, press releases,  newsletters and daily newspapers.]  SIS  JULY/AUGUST 1999 Feature   Violence against women and the criminal justice system in Canada:  Getting away with murder  by Agnes Huang  A man kills his wife (ex-wife, girlfriend, common-law spouse). Murder? No,  manslaughter. Why? She provoked him.  Life imprisonment? No, maybe three,  five, seven years...including double for time  already served. Why? She provoked him.  Provocation: "a wrongful act or insult  that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to  deprive an ordinary person of the power of  self-control" [Criminal Code, Section 232.]  Provocation: a court-sanctioned excuse  a man can use to justify why he killed a  woman.  Men using the defence Of provocation  to avoid being convicted of murder for killing their female partners or ex-partners has  made its way into the public spotlight over  the past few months. In late May, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) handed  down its ruling in the case of Bert Stone.  And the month before, Louise Hardy, a  member of parliament from the Yukon, put  forward a private members' bill calling for  the abolishment of the provocation defence.  In its ruling, the SCC upheld the sentence given to Stone for stabbing his wife,  Donna Mae, to death 47 times in March  1994. After discovering she was dead, Stone  stuffed Donna's body into the tool box at  the back of his truck, drove to their home  in Winfield, British Columbia, then shortly  after, took a flight to Mexico.  Stone claims Donna had "provoked"  him by mocking his sexual prowess, the paternity of his children, and threatening to  divorce him. Stone says he doesn't remember what happened, only that he heard a  "whooshing" sound. The jury convicted  him of the lesser charge of manslaughter.  Hardy's bill comes out of a case that  mobilized the community of Whitehorse,  Yukon to call for reforms to the Criminal  Code. In November 1995, Ralph Klassen  strangled to death his estranged wife, Susan  [see page 10.] Klassen claims his wife had  "provoked" him by mocking his infertility  and making reference to her interest in another man. The jury convicted him of the  lesser charge of manslaughter.  Both BC's Attorney General Ujjal  Dosanjh and federal Minister of Justice  Anne McLellan have publicly stated that  the defence of provocation needs to be reviewed. In fact, Dosanjh has spoken out for  the abolishment of the defence in cases of  spousal homicide.  It is ironic then, that in neither the Stone  nor Klassen cases did the BC Crown or the  federal Crown, respectively, challenge the  consideration or the acceptance of the defence of provocation. Nor did either Crown  base its appeal on the evidence of prior history of abuse that was ruled inadmissible  (or not pursued by the Crown) [see sidebar.]  Instead, it was the sentences handed  out to Stone and Klassen that the government representatives took issue with. /Kinesis was unable to secure interviews with either Ujjal Dosanjh or Anne McLellan.]  Bert Stone was sentenced to seven  years in prison. However, given that the 18  months he spent in jail awaiting trial was  doubled and counted as three years, Stone's  sentence after the verdict amounted to only  four years. Stone is now out.  Ralph Klassen was sentenced to five  years in prison. Last July, he was granted  day parole, and is scheduled for full release  this October.  Susan Klassen's sister, Brenda  McDonald, says she doesn't understand  why the Crown only focused on the sentence in its appeal. "To me, the verdict  should have been appealed," says  McDonald. "The court is still saying that  Susan was at fault for not wanting her estranged spouse in her house."  McDonald points to facts that show  Ralph Klassen knew what he was doing.  Klassen had driven up from Southern Alberta to Whitehorse in a day to see Susuan,  and that night, he killed her. "It didn't matter that Ralph wrote a suicide note confessing and saying he was jealous that Susan  was leaving him. The judge instead interpreted this as a clear sign of remorse."  At his parole hearing, the warden at  William Head Institution (near Victoria)  where Klassen is incarcerated called him  the "cream of the crop." And Klassen's  counsellor said they had had numerous  conversations about the "type" of women  he chooses. [Blame the victim/woman.]  This is similar to the sentiment expressed by the parole board members hearing Bert Stone's application for day parole:  "...you tend to gravitate towards females  who have been previously involved in dysfunctional relationships." [Again, blame  the victim/woman.]  "What does a person have to do to  show he is violent?" asks McDonald.  Surely, a very important question.  The whole characterization of men  who escape murder convictions for killing  their female partners or ex-partners as not  dangerous is fairly typical. Andree Cote,  director of legislation and law reform with  the National Association of Women and the  Law, says she has read cases from the 1980s  which basically say that the man was a danger to his wife [but not to anyone else or  society] but since she's dead, there is no  reason to put him in prison. "You literally  had this kind of logic."  The Supreme Court on Stone...  In upholding Bert Stone's sentence, the  SCC basically said that trial judges should  have the leeway to make those decisions.  [The SCC had denied the federal Crown's application to appeal Ralph Klassen's sentence.]  One issue related to the defence of  provocation addressed by the SCC is "double-benefit." Cote explains that in Quebec,  the courts have ruled that if the accused is  successful in using the defence of provocation to reduce a murder charge to manslaughter, then it will not consider the same  defence at the sentencing stage because the  accused has already benefitted from it.  In the Stone case, the SCC ruled that an  accused can use provocation both ways: to  reduce murder to manslaughter, and then to  reduce the severity of the sentence.  see PROVOCATION page 16  How "fair" is a fair trial  The laws of evidence are intended to  protect the accused and ensure a "fair"  trial. But how "fair" is "fair," if the laws  of evidence can be invoked to deny justice to women killed by their male partners or ex-partners?  Marilyn McCrimmon, a professor of  law at the University of British Columbia,  says that, in criminal proceedings, evidence  is confined to that particular incident for  which the accused is on trial, unless there  is something particularly relevant.  So what is "relevant?" McCrimmon  says evidence is deemed "not relevant" if  the purpose is to show the accused was  the type of person who is violent. Evidence  in cases of violence against women would  only be deemed "relevant," if it showed  the accused had a continuous passion towards hatred of the woman—that is, it  spoke to his state of mind.  McCrimmon notes that admission of  evidence is very "discretionary." Then,  even if evidence is deemed relevant, the  trial judge can deny it as prejudicial.  In both the Stone and Klassen cases,  evidence that many feel was relevant to  establish the intent of the accused, was not  allowed to be heard by the jury.  Following up on the community's  outrage at Stone's manslaughter conviction, The Kelowna Daily Courier printed a  list of evidence not allowed into trial on  October 24,1995, a few days before Stone  was sentenced.  In Fall 1993, Donna and Bert were  driving back from Prince George. They  fought when Donna tried to get Bert to  stop in Kamloops to drop off some things  to her daughter. Stone struck Donna in the  mouth and tried to pull her out of the  truck. A passing motorcyclist intervened.  On October 17, 1993, a man heard  Donna scream as she was on top of the  hood of Stone's car in the parking lot of  A&W in Winfield. The man saw Stone hit  Donna several times on the head and face.  Later, Donna would tell police that Stone  had struck her four times with his car before she ended up on his hood. Donna  called the police because she was afraid  Stone would come after her again.  On February 15,1994, Donna and a  friend went to the RCMP detachment in  Kelowna, and told the RCMP that Stone  had been threatening to kill her if she  didn't convince the police to drop the  pending charges related to the A&W assault. Since December, Donna had met  with police several times begging them to  withdraw the case. The RCMP would not.  Ironically, the Crown had approved  an assault charge against Stone two days  before Donna was killed. That charge has  never been pursued.  The trial judge, Donald Brenner,  would not allow the incidents to be introduced in as evidence because the assaults  happened so long prior to the killing that  they had no bearing on Stone's actions  the day he stabbed Donna.  Brenner also rejected much of the  evidence of Stone's alleged prior history  of abusing Donna because it was based  on Donna's statements to other people.  The trial judge said he wasn't convinced  the testimony was reliable because of  Donna sometimes "exaggerated and had  a tendency to lie." [Part of the questioning  of Donna's credibility rested on the fact that  she had asked the RCMP to drop the assault  charges against Stone.]  Because none of this evidence was  allowed in during the trial, Bert Stone  was able to tell the jury that he had never  struck his wife or become angry at her  before he killed her.  Brenda McDonald, Susan Klassen's  sister, says everything also went Ralph  Klassen's way. "It seemed that anytime  Ralph wanted to use history, it was OK."  However, when it was a matter of his  credibility, that was another thing.  According to McDonald, the biggest  problem in the case against Ralph  Klassen was the Crown. She says the  Crown's argument essentially was that  Klassen was an "ordinary guy" and  should have known better.  When the Crown lawyer put to  Klassen that Susan had been seeking a  divorce, he denied it. However, the  Crown lawyer did not challenge him on  that, even though McDonald says she  had taken great pains to obtain divorce  documents from a lawyer Susan had consulted.  As well, McDonald says the Crown  never pursued allegations that Klassen  was abusive towards his first wife.  Klassen had been married 20 years earlier, for three months. During that short  period, he allegedly choked his first wife,  beat her and smashed her face. She left  him and had their marriage annulled. His  first wife did not pursue charges against  Klassen.  At his trial, when asked if he had  been married before, Klassen said yes,  but explained that they were too young  and went their separate ways. His alleged  violence towards his first wife was not  raised at trial, only later at his parole hearing after the woman had came forward  herself. The Crown lawyer told  McDonald that Klassen's first wife's testimony likely would not have been admissible in any case because the incidents  happened so long ago.  Joanne Klineberg of the federal Justice Department says there are no plans  to review the laws of evidence. However,  she adds that following the Allison Parrot case, there have been questions raised  about what information is and isn't admissible at trial.  JULY/AUGUST 1999  KINESIS Feature         Violence against women and the defense of provocation:  The case of Susan Klassen  by Shelagh Smith  Susan Klassen was 36 years old at the  time of her death. She was a well-loved and  deeply respected occupational therapist  and international storyteller. She was coordinator of therapy services for the  Thompson Centre, a long term care facility,  in Whitehorse, Yukon and director of the  Yukon International Storytelling Festival.  Susan was married in 1982 to Ralph  Klassen. Ralph grew up in Manitoba, riis  family belonged first to the Mennonite  Church and later to the Christian Missionary Alliance Church. Ralph earned his masters in Theology, but was a pastor for only  seven months. He worked in a number of  jobs over the years: truck driver, farmer, car  salesman, carpenter and photographer.  During their marriage, Susan and  Ralph lived in many communities, only  staying in any one place for several months  or a few years because of Ralph's inability  to settle and find meaningful employment.  They moved to Whitehorse in 1990.  The Klassen marriage showed signs of  stress over the years, with the couple separating several times. In the Fall of 1995,  Susan and her husband agreed to a six-  month trial separation. Susan sought a  separation because of her husband's jealousy, anger and physical aggression.  Susan helped Ralph, financially and  emotionally, to resettle in Alberta so he  could build a new life for himself. Ralph  could not accept Susan's desire for independence and saw it as rejection.  On November 1,1995, Ralph returned  to Whitehorse to try to convince Susan to  reconcile the marriage. However, the separation was important to Susan and she  knew that nothing could have changed between them in such a short period of time.  Later that night, Ralph strangled his  wife to death. He claims that he lost control after Susan allegedly made a remark  about his inability to produce children and  her interest in another man. (Susan's family and friends say these remarks are not  consistent with her character.)  Ralph claims to have "blacked out" after getting on top of Susan and putting his  hands around her neck. Trial evidence suggests that Ralph first choked Susan with his  bare hands, spraining both his thumbs under the force, until she lost consciousness.  He then took a pillowcase off a pillow and  tied it extremely tight around Susan's neck,  permanently cutting off the oxygen to her  brain. There were no signs of a struggle.  Ralph wrote a note apologizing for going into a jealous fit of rage, and then tried  to kill himself by deliberately driving into  an oncoming vehicle on the highway. Ralph  received minor cuts and bruises, but the  driver of the vehicle—a propane truck—  lost three months of work and continues to  receive physiotherapy for injuries to his  back and neck. Ralph was never charged  for this offence.  Ralph was charged with second degree  murder in the death of his wife. He admitted to police and to the court that he had  strangled his wife in a fit of jealousy.  On January 17, 1997, the jury found  Klassen not guilty of murder, but guilty of  a lesser offense of manslaughter. The next  day, Ralph Klassen was sentenced to five  years imprisonment, including time served.  He is scheduled for release in October 1999.  When Ralph became eligible for day parole  in the Spring of 1998, the parole board rejected his application because it felt he  showed no remorse and did not take any  responsibility for his crime.  The reaction to the verdict was immediate and far-reaching. A petition was  started on January 20th, demanding that  the Crown appeal the case. Over 1,000 people signed this petition. Because a case can  only be appealed on a point of law, a letter  was drafted and sent to then Minister of  Justice Allan Rock requesting an external  review of the trial transcripts to determine  whether there was, in fact, a point of law  on which to appeal the verdict or the sentence.  In Whitehorse, on January 24, over 300  women, men and youth participated in  minus 40 degree temperature in a silent  march to protest the verdict and sentence  Ralph Klassen received.  There has since been a letter writing  campaign and a petition requesting  changes to the Criminal Code concerning  violence against women, and in particular,  domestic femicide. To date, over 10,000 signatures have been collected across Canada.  The petition has been presented several times in the House of Commons.  Louise Hardy, a member of Parliament  from the Yukon, has also introduced a private member's bill calling for the elimination of the defense of provocation.  Statistically, and from women's own  experiences, a relationship that ends in violence almost always has had a history of  violence. This history of violence must be  recognized and taken into consideration by  the justice system when women's lives are  taken by their partners or ex-partners. The  dynamics of controlling behavior in abusive men is such that it starts with verbal  abuse, intimidation and threats and then  escalates to physical abuse which becomes  increasingly violent, sometimes ending in  the final act of murder.  At his trial, Ralph stated that he and  Susan had became more distant after they  moved to Whitehorse. It was at this time  that Susan began to pursue some of her  own interests, including storytelling, and  to establish roots in the community. Ralph  became increasingly jealous of Susan's  friendships and popularity and tried to  convince her many times that they should  move again. Susan wanted to stay.  Ralph's jealousy and controlling  behavior were well known to many of their  friends. In 1994, Susan was scheduled to  perform at the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. She did not show up. Many  felt that an emergency must have come up  because it was highly unlike Susan to miss  the festival.  Later, Susan would only admit that she  did not attend the festival because of  Ralph's anger—she "wasn't spending  enough time helping him build their  home." It was obviously not worth the risk  for Susan to take two hours to fulfill her  commitment that day.  Another incident occurred in 1992.  While performing in the play, Last Rites,  Susan often showed up late for rehearsals,  in tears. She had many angry confrontations with Ralph while trying to leave their  home because Ralph was trying to control  the amount of time she spent with friends.  On the stand, Ralph claimed not to recall any of these incidents, yet these incidents are very vivid in the memories of  many others.  Susan often had to calm Ralph's anger.  In March 1993, Susan was looking for a  mirror with a wood frame for the bathroom  of their newly built country home. She was  unable to find anything suitable in any of  the Whitehorse stores. One day that month,  Ralph became infuriated with Susan; he  screamed that she was too stupid and incompetent to find a mirror. His rage was  so out of control that it was impossible for  Susan to pacify his anger. While friends of  Susan were aware this conflict had occurred, Ralph stated in court that he did  not recall the incident.  On another occasion, in June 1995,  Susan returned to work after being away  on a sea kayaking trip for women. She arrived late to a meeting that morning. Her  co-workers noticed she had used make-up  to try and cover up a black eye. Friends  knew that Ralph had been very angry at  Susan the,night before. Susan never told  anyone how she got the injury, and was silent when asked if Ralph had given her the  black eye. In court, Ralph claimed he did  not know how his wife got the black eye.  Susan was always protecting Ralph's  "character," too embarrassed for people to  know what she faced daily; she didn't want  people to worry about her. She was also  very supportive of Ralph's projects and attempts to find meaningful employment  throughout the years, accompanying him  to remote fishing camps and isolated farms,  often to the detriment of her own personal  and career advancement. Ralph admitted  to the court that he put his own needs in  front of others and was self serving.  In her paper, The Defense of Provocation  and Domestic Femicide, Andree Cote states  that men who batter women use minimization, confusion, outright denial, intoxication, loss of control and projection to  blame their victim and deny their own responsibility.  The provocation defense in the Criminal Code as it is currently used in femicide/  wife slaughter cases inappropriately and  unjustly changes the focus of the criminal  trial from the behaviour of the accused and  his intentions to the behaviour of the victim. The statutory defense of provocation  provides a legal excuse for men's anger. It  reduces what would otherwise be murder  to manslaughter.  Manslaughter is when the offender  commits an act that unintentionally results  in death. Second degree murder is when  an offender commits an act that is intended  to cause death, or bodily harm likely to  cause death.  According to the paper Reforming the  Defense of Provocation by Sheila Galloway  and Joanne St. Lewis, the defence of provo  cation is used mostly by men who kill  women because they are emotionally unable to accept loss of power and control.  When women kill their husbands, it is almost invariably because of a history of battering and abuse. It is an act of self-defence  for themselves and their children. No matter who dies in the relationship—and it is  mostly women who do—it is often a reaction to a history of repeated male violence,  not of female violence.  Although the statutory defence of  provocation was disallowed by the judge  in the Klassen case, the judge did instruct  the jurors that on the basis of "common  law," they could consider provocation-type  evidence in the following way:  "The law is that where the conduct of  the deceased produces in the accused a  state of excitement, anger or disturbance so  intense that he may not contemplate the  consequences of his acts, and might not in  fact intend to bring about those consequences, then you can find the accused did  not have the intent to kill or cause bodily  harm that he knew was likely to result in  death."  Allowing provocation-type evidence  often reduces second degree murder to a  conviction of manslaughter in cases of domestic femicide, as happened in this case.  An appeal on Ralph Klassen's five-year  sentence was dismissed in June 1997 by the  British Columbia-Yukon Court of Appeal.  The federal Department of Justice tried to  appeal Klassen's sentence to the Supreme  Court of Canada, but this request was  turned down.  We continue to ask people to write Justice Minister Anne McLellan and urge her  to take immediate action. In order for men  to take full criminal responsibility for their  violent actions against women, the statutory defence of provocation should be abolished. The common law rule which allows  provocation type evidence to be used to  negate the intent to murder should be  amended by statute.  We are the voices for the women who  have died at the hands of male violence and  for those who are kept silent in abusive relationships. We must send a strong message  that the Canadian justice system must  change to reflect society's standard of zero  tolerance of violence against women.

[For addresses, see the Letters  section on page 20 of this issue.]  Shelagh Smith was a friend of Susan Klassen.  She get involved in the campaign to abolish  the defense of provocation because she was  shocked that Susan was blamed for her own  death because of something she (allegedly) said.  She feels that the existence of the provocation  defense excuses men (and women) from taking  responsibility for their violent behaviour.  10  SIS  JULY/AUGUST 1999 Feature  Women with disabilities in Canada:  The making of DAWN  A new book has been published by  DAWN Canada (DisAbled Women's Network Canada) to provide women with information on how to form their local  DAWN group, or groups for support or  companionship.  DAWN Canada is a national organization formed to address the needs of women  with disabilities. There are local DAWNs  in most provinces and territories. Given the  lack of funding support from government  and other sources, DAWN groups are run  almost entirely by women with disabilities  who volunteer their time, energy, skills and  commitment.  DAWNing: How to Start and Maintain a  Group is based on women's experience, and  is full of encouragement and practical advice. The manual is written in Plain Language [see box] by women who live and  work with disabilities of all kinds.  Edited by Joan Meister and Shirley  Masuda, both long-time activists with  DAWN Canada, the manual is broken  down into seven chapters, with references  and relevant organizations listed at the end  of the book. DAWNing walks women  through various issues that may come up  when they start planning their own groups.  Some of the issues covered are: setting up  a society, feminist group process, diversity,  cross-disability, confidentiality, conducting  research, coalition building, advocacy, writing grant proposals, and accessible language. The manual also has an "Access  Needs Checklist," which is valuable not  only for organizations run by women with  disabilities, but also for any women's organization.  On this and the following four pages,  Kinesis presents excerpts from DAWNing.  Below, Joan Meister talks about the need  for this kind of resource manual. On the  next three pages, Meister and Eileen  O'Brien, both past-Chairs of DAWN  Canada, give their insights into the developing herstory of the organization. And finally, a list of DAWN groups across Canada  and an order form for DAWNing appear on  page 17.  so scary anymore...  fQ  by Joan Meister  The need for DAWNing probably occurred to me immediately after I became  the Chair of DAWN Canada in 1987, way  back on a cold winter afternoon in Winnipeg. It was our founding conference and I  agreed to be Chair. (I knew how to chair a  meeting.) I'd been active in my union, left-  wing politics and, of course, the women's  movement. "Rules of Order" didn't scare  me anymore. Why, I knew how to deal with  "challenges to the chair" and a "preferential speaker's list," too.  Hah! Fools rush in...  What I didn't know was that chairing  a meeting is only a small, small part of running, helping to shape and keeping alive, a  national organization like DAWN Canada.  There are so many other things that are also  important:  □ I spent an awful lot of time flying  back and forth to Ottawa and many other  cities.  □ I attended endless meetings with bureaucrats (government employees) and  politicians (elected representatives).  □ I supervised all projects.  □ I answered the phone that never  stopped ringing.  MS (multiple sclerosis) and low energy  had already taught me how to set priorities (putting things in order of importance)  and it was a good thing. I couldn't believe  how many things I was doing for the first  time—things I didn't actually know how  to do. Thank goodness I had Shirley  Masuda here in Vancouver to listen to me,  support me, and help me lots and lots. And  Maria Barile in Montreal and Pat Israel in  Toronto, and...  I began to understand how lucky I was  to have had relevant (similar, fitting) experiences doing things like taking hours and  hours of minutes, participating in panels,  or being on my union's negotiating (bargaining) team. All of these things helped  me to be able to do many things for DAWN  Canada.  Then I began to realize how few other  women with disabilities had ever had those  kinds of opportunities. I started using a  wheelchair at 30 and I'd had a chance to  do many (mostly inaccessible) things before  that. I learned that many women with disabilities have lived institutionalized,  medicalized or just plain isolated, since  birth. Or that they have been unemployed  or underemployed, and never have had the  chance to go to a job interview, never mind  a union meeting.  I soon found that most of the political  work I had done before was suddenly not  accessible to me. I didn't stop being a feminist and a trade unionist but I did start using a wheelchair, and my former world had  too many stairs and was suddenly closed  to me and beyond my reach. The women's  movement didn't really "get it" about access.  I turned to the disability community  to do my political work and soon after, I  realized the disability community just  didn't "get it" about women's issues. I  turned there because I figured that it would  be accessible. It seemed that these organizations, which were mostly dominated  (controlled) by men, weren't interested in  doing—or didn't have enough time or  money to do—anything about an issue like  mothering as a woman with a disability or  about the violence in our lives. Different  priorities.  Not too long after that, I started to wish  that somebody had written down some of  the things I needed to know and had the  answers to the thousands of questions I  had. Questions like:  □ How do you hold an accessible meeting?  O How do you form a society?  d And why should you?  □ Just how do you go about getting  money out of the government?  □ Why doesn't anyone have a simple  checklist for access needs?  For the longest time, I was zooming off  to zillions of meetings with important people about important issues and never feeling as though I really knew what I was doing. My main objective during those first  years was to get women with disabilities  on the agenda—everybody's agenda—and  keep us there. I spent a lot of time asking a  lot of different people for lots of advice  about a lot of different things.  DAWNing is an attempt to give answers to those kinds of questions, put down  in one place, so that you can feel a bit more  confident than I used to feel.  In those days, I relied heavily on my  general belief that people with disabilities  scared most non-disabled people or at least  made them uncomfortable. I felt that having a disability gave me a tiny advantage  in a world where, as a feminist in a wheelchair, I did not have much power or much  ability to influence decisions. I still rely on  that one sometimes. But DAWN Canada  has made it mostly unnecessary for us to  use those kinds of stupid devices. As  women with disabilities, we have believable (credible) issues and, therefore, we are  taken a bit more seriously than we were at  the beginning.  I hope that after you have a look at  DAWNing or even parts of it, you will know  how to hold your meeting or how to get  some money from the government or that  this "process" stuff isn't too mysterious. If  you take it all apart into smaller pieces, it  doesn't seem so hard or big.  But more importantly, I hope you figure out how to reach out to other women  with disabilities, get together with them  and make your lives better. I hope you share  some good advice, good ideas and good  laughs. I hope you start some cross-disability, truly accessible groups for women with  disabilities—whether you decide to become  a society or not and no matter what your  reasons are for getting together! And I sure  hope that DAWNing gives you some clear  ideas about how to get there. And why we  should try and keep trying.  .•••••••  Using Plain Language **w#,  □ women labelled mentally handi-  *  DAWNing is meant to be written  in Plain Language.

It was the first time  women with disabilities from all across  Canada had ever got together as women  with disabilities to talk about issues of concern to women with disabilities at an event  that was organized by women with disabilities. A few good women had not only  dreamed of getting just women with disabilities together, without any men, to talk  to each other about really important things,  they did it! The meeting took place. "We  were in charge," says Maria, one of the organizers. It's her favourite memory of that  time.  The meeting was organized by Pat Israel (Toronto), Pat Danforth (Regina) and  Maria Barile (Montreal). Each of these visionaries (people who see far into the future) had been working in the disability  Pat Danforth thought of our wonderful name, DAWN: DisAbled Women's Network. The name was a response to the idea  that we should create an autonomous (independent) national organization to explore our issues of concern and be the voice  of women with disabilities in Canada.  Not surprisingly, we realized that there  was a lot of work to do. We decided that:  □ we absolutely had to get to work on  the issues that we had identified; we  needed to do research on them.  □ we had to go home and start more  groups, have more meetings like this one.  □ we had to stay in touch with each other  on a national level.  We thought if there were 17 of us in  one room in Ottawa, just imagine how  many of us there were out there in the  whole country. We didn't think about how  PEI, Saskatchewan and Ontario were also  being started up.  During this time, Pat Israel and Pat  Danforth got funding to hold our founding conference. I was busy getting the Constitution and By-Laws written as a draft to  take to the conference. We were all busy  getting our provincial groups organized.  An "angel" appeared here in BC to help the  Steering Committee, and we were given  free postage and photocopying.  Disabled Peoples' International Conference  Not too long after the first meeting in  Ottawa, DAWN Canada was offered funding from the federal government for five of  us to attend the Second World Congress of  Disabled Peoples' International (DPI) in the  Bahamas. DPI is the group that represents  that Disabled Peoples' International made  sure women with disabilities had an equal  voice and an equal place in DPI. This is a  work in progress.  It was a very powerful feeling, though,  to be working with all of these wonderful  women with disabilities from all over the  world. And a proud feeling, knowing that  we all "got it." DAWN Canada had truly  begun. We understood that we were really  part of a pretty amazing network—women  with disabilities from all over the world and  all over Canada, too.  The founding conference  In March 1987, the founding conference of DAWN Canada took place in Winnipeg. A number of important things took  place during this meeting. Not only did we  ratify (approve) the Constitution and By-  community for a long time. [That community] was not supportive of issues of concern to women with disabilities. Each  woman believed that a meeting to talk to  other women was very important. They  wanted to identify and discuss big issues  in our lives as women with disabilities.  A fine old DAWN tradition was begun.  The organizers got money from the federal  government to hold this meeting in Ottawa  at the Westin Hotel. It was the only hotel in  Ottawa that had enough modified  (changed to be accessible) rooms to accommodate us (meet our needs). It was very  expensive—access can be expensive when  there are no choices. The hotel is connected  to a mall but no one went shopping!  Instead, 17 women with disabilities  from all across Canada started talking. We  talked for three days. Non-stop. We met in  a room with no windows and covered all  four walls with four levels of flip chart  pages. We talked like we'd never been in a  room with that many other women with  disabilities before. We hadn't. It was exhausting (tiring) and very high energy at  the same time. We were in charge.  We got a lot of work done. We defined  six areas of major concern:  G mothering  □ self image  O employment  □ health  O sexuality  O violence  we didn't have one cent to do anything  with; we just knew there was a need to do  it. We decided to return to our various parts  of the country and organize DAWN groups  locally. Most of us made a commitment to  do lots of hard work.  It was an amazing three-day meeting;  it was well-organized and well-run. It was  our first taste of government funding. It  was a first attempt to represent women with  all kinds of disabilities. Or so we thought.  We didn't have a very good grasp of cross-  disability at that first meeting. We did not  have any women who represented women  with mental illness or any who were labelled mentally handicapped. We didn't  even know about women with brain injuries or HTV/AIDS then.  A Steering Committee was formed to  guide DAWN through its infancy. These  women already had computers and all  were attached to e-mail (electronic mail)  and that was how we kept in touch. We had  absolutely no money so it was just as well  we were able to talk to each other electronically instead of by long distance phone  calls. We still don't have enough money to  have a phone number listed for DAWN  Canada!  When I returned to Vancouver, I was  given the opportunity at a BC Coalition of  People with Disabilities conference to hold  a workshop for women. That was the beginning of DAWN BC. Groups in Quebec,  national organizations of people with all  kinds of disabilities.  For me, it was a very powerful experience because there were more of us than  them—the guests with disabilities outnumbered the non-disabled guests. We  didn't feel weird when they got on an elevator with a bunch of us; they did. It was  hurricane season but luckily, there was no  hurricane of a weather-related variety.  There was a big storm brewing inside,  though. The DAWN Canada women called  a women's meeting and 60 women attended it. It lasted all evening and was  translated into five languages (English,  Laws, we also decided to join the national  umbrella organization for disability groups  in Canada, the Council of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (COPOH).  [COPOH has since changed its name to the  Council of Canadians with Disabilities  (CCD).] We also decided to join other feminists at the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC).  We approved (ratified) the she areas decided in Ottawa as priority areas for future  DAWN Canada work and decided to ask  the federal government for funding to do  the research. No one had ever done any  research before about issues of concern to  French, Japanese, American Sign Language—women with disabilities.  and Spanish) more-or-less at the same time  (simultaneously) and spontaneously (without any planning). The work of translating for the meeting was done by women  who are bilingual and who volunteered to  doit.  DAWN was able to play a useful role  since we had spent three days in Ottawa  figuring out what the biggest issues were  for us. We shared our knowledge with the  women from around the world and found  we all had similar concerns. Imagine that.  Anyway, there was this other big concern  about the DPI Congress: gender parity  (equal numbers of women and men participating equally).  That women-only meeting resolved to  (decided to do it and act on it) make sure  The final piece of important business  was the election of a Board of Directors. The  Board was representative of each region of  Canada and almost all disabilities. The  Board elected an Executive, and DAWN  Canada was born!  Starting to work  The Board immediately began to put  into action the directions from both the  meeting in Ottawa and the founding conference in Winnipeg. Research, research, research. We all knew about the issues in our  own lives and those of the women we knew,  but we knew nothing more general or representative about women with all kinds of  disabilities in Canada, and neither did anyone else.  We were given enough to produce papers on employment, violence and  parenting. We hired Julian Ridington as our  first researcher, and she gathered the information and produced the papers. She sent  out a very long questionnaire to women all  across the country and waited for their responses. Lots of women were interviewed  for their more in-depth comments. During  her work, Jillian found that all of the topics  involved the issue of self-image, and so she  did an additional paper on that topic, too.  The response was overwhelming.  Women let us know in detail about every  aspect of their lives. From their responses,  we knew we were heading in the right direction. The papers we produced in 1989  were:  □ Who Do We Think We Are?: Self Image  and Women with Disabilities  D Different Therefore Unequal: Employment and Women with Disabilities  □ Beating the "Odds:" Violence and  Women with Disabilities  O The Only Parent in the Neighbourhood:  Mothering and Women with Disabilities  The papers were the first research done  by women with disabilities about women  with disabilities. We've been recognized  since then as world leaders on issues of  concern to women with disabilities. We  only had enough funding to produce a  small number of them and these important  documents are now out-of-print (we ran  out). We still get requests for them.  In 1991, we held another Annual General Meeting which was attached to a conference called "Self-Image: Who Do We  Think We Are?" Pat Israel was elected Chair  and soon after DAWN Canada received  enough funding to open a national office  in Toronto. Joanne Doucette was hired as  the Coordinator.  Pat resigned before she burned out and  everything came back to Vancouver. As the  Past-Chair, I ended up doing the same stuff  I was doing before.  Working harder and faster  The next few years were a blur of activity for DAWN Canada. We were  swamped with requests to attend government meetings, consultations and conferences, and other organizations' events. We  got lots of phone calls for information, and  requests for documents. We had no staff  and no office. The business of this national  organization was again being conducted  out of my bedroom.  The fact that so many were interested  in our existence let us know we were providing a valuable and unique service to  those who were well enough connected to  know that DAWN Canada existed. Unfortunately these were mostly bureaucrats,  politicians and other national organizations, not necessarily women with disabilities.  DAWN Canada Board members were  in touch with the women who were trying  to organize on the provincial level. We  hoped, anyway. The women at the provincial level didn't (and still don't) get much  financial support either.  My main job was to keep DAWN  Canada alive. This meant keeping the  Board of Directors informed about the  events that were happening. Another important aspect was getting DAWN and our  issues on everybody's agenda: the women's movement, the disability community,  the funders, the employers, the insurance  companies, the politicians...  Meanwhile, back in the regions...  At the beginning, DAWN groups were  popping up all over the country. There was  a huge excitement in the air and women  with disabilities were happy to get involved  and talk to each other for the first time. The  groups that were starting up had lots of  enthusiasm but no experience or resources.  Although we got funding to put out a  few copies of a national newsletter, Thriving, DAWN Canada did not have the resources to do much communication or support work for the members in the regions.  It was no better in the provinces.  DAWN Ontario got some decent funding  from their provincial government for  awhile and they did some wonderful work,  especially in the areas of health and sexuality. And then the provincial government  changed from NDP to Conservative [in  1995] and that was the end of their funding. Quebec and Saskatchewan got some  funding and so did a couple of other provinces, but it didn't last very long.  Over time, the lack of resources began  to take its toll on the women who were trying to do DAWN work everywhere. We are  not a bunch of whiners and complainers  but we do have disabilities and our individual needs require some care and attention, too. We weren't able to replace ourselves and get some new blood because we  didn't get funded to hold annual general  meetings or even regular meetings. We  started to drop like flies.  The lack of resources took its toll on  the organization as well as the individual  women, of course. DAWN Canada began  to falter and fade. We were no longer "thriving." We simply weren't able to do the very  necessary things that would have kept us  healthy.  I stayed on as Chair for far too long  because the government doesn't fund annual general meetings. By the time we did  manage to have an AGM in 1994, DAWN  Canada was a mere shadow of its former  proud and vigorous (lively) self.  Part Two  by Eileen O'Brien  When I became Chairperson of DAWN  Canada in 1994,1 knew that we had our  work cut out for us if we were going to sustain it (keep it going) and strengthen our  national organization. DAWN Canada was  run solely (only) by volunteer labour, except for the researcher employed on any  current project.  We had been existing on only project  funding since the beginning, and the organization was primarily (mainly) a research and policy (planning) advisory  group. We did projects by and about  women with disabilities and spoke about  our findings to various government bodies, DAWN members and allies. We had  affiliate groups as well across the country  that we shared information with, but very  little direct communication was possible  (affordable) among the DAWN groups,  members or supporters.  Our research was brave and revolutionary: we hired only women with disabilities and we worked hard to keep our  voice our own. Shirley Masuda, our senior researcher, fought consistently for this.  The research principles she helped DAWN  Canada develop have served as a model  for other grassroots groups in both Canada  and the United States.  We wanted to keep control of that process of speaking in our own voices and doing our own research. We wanted our  struggle for freedom to be our own. We  joined our voice with the sound of the international disability movement's battle  cry:  Nothing about us without us!  Maintaining a national group with no  money meant we had to develop community development principals into most research projects. Action research with focus  groups across the country became our way  of ensuring a strongly representative voice.  We tried increasingly to provide something  concrete in the project itself that would improve things for our members, such as a  self-help manual or kit which could be used  by the groups or individual women.  Another progressive research model  was to train a woman who had strong skills  and experience in a specific topic but lacked  the necessary academic qualifications to be  a researcher on her own. A DAWN Canada  researcher who was qualified was paid to  co-ordinate the project and oversee the  methodology (process), and the DAWN  woman-in-training took on the project.  This team approach was very successful and we think it allowed for a very in-  depth commitment to the subject matter. It  also provided our community with another  trained researcher.  With little to no money, we communicated with our Board and affiliate (member) groups in most provinces and the Yukon through working together on projects,  using our Board of Directors as the Advisory Committee (including on this project!).  Our ability to communicate, however, was  limited to project bulletins, questionnaires  and advisory committee meetings.  As a result of a very successful project  on new reproductive technologies, we were  able, not only to educate women on the  very complex health and social costs of this  technology, but also to send out a good  batch of other information in the form of  our newsletter, Thriving.  Our newsletter brought us responses  from all over the world. It helped us to increase our membership and open doors to  stronger alliances (partnerships) with the  women's movement as well as with women  see DAWN next page Feature  from DAWN previous page  with disabilities in other cross-disability  organizations. We were only funded to produce a few issues of Thriving and then were  told that the government doesn't fund  newsletters.  DAWN Canada had begun to work on  justice issues (legal cases) before 1994 and  had participated in some pioneering coalitions in two very important cases which affected women with disabilities and other  women. Both cases involved the rights of  sexual assault victims. DAWN Canada's involvement in these legal cases opened the  door for many more successful partnerships (alliances).  We were building coalitions to intervene in cases involving discrimination under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms. We soon discovered that not only  could we inform the courts and the lawyers and organizations we worked with  about our issues, but we could again use  this experience to develop our own community.  We were able to learn about significant  (important) Charter rights and their application (use, function) and to hear directly  from specific women with disabilities who  were affected by the decision. For the first  time in history, we have had an important  (significant) voice in the courts of Canada  and we hope, in the future, to guarantee  that a community development aspect for  DAWN Canada exists in each of the cases  we work on.  This work was made possible by the  strong commitment of the Court Challenges  Program, funded by Canada's Department  of Justice. It gives resources to grassroots  groups such as ours. We have worked with  other equality seeking groups and have  learned that despite our broad differences,  on the issue of discrimination we have  much in common. We came to understand  that a court case fighting for the rights to  same-sex benefits, for example, has broad  implications (consequences, things that  might result) for people with disabilities  and very specifically women with disabilities.  Building coalitions: strange bedfellows  Understanding the need to work together on these kinds of issues has meant a  new kind of alliance (coalition) building—  a new kind of inter-dependence (depending on each other) which we think is crucial (very important) in light of current government cutbacks and rising incidences of  discrimination against the most vulnerable  (unprotected, defenceless) in our society.  w\\\\n\u\\\\\\\\\mm  Massage  Therapy  Craniosacral  Therapy  736-1910  315-2150 West Broadway,  Vancouver, BC  Judith tries to break the sound m  barrier and be accepted by  non-hearing impaired  feminists.  Working with the Council of Canadians with Disabilities (CCD) has been a challenge in many regards. We have, I think,  worked hard together to strengthen our  common voice as people with disabilities  on the issue of funding to disability groups  and other issues related to social policy in  Canada, such as transportation, et cetera.  We continue to value this process of working together as important in our development as a culture and as a movement.  As DAWN Canada, however, we find  ourselves at odds with this very patriarchal  (male, top-down, hierarchical) model of a  group which is not used to the feminist  process of consensus and coalition building. As a lobbying group, the CCD has been  remarkable in its tireless negotiations for a  place for people with disabilities on the  government's agenda.  However, as a grassroots movement,  there is still much work to be done. The  principle of hiring people with disabilities  to do the research and to speak for ourselves is a basic premise (assumption) in  the development of our community of  women with disabilities. It is not understood or adhered to by the CCD. Discrimination against and ignorance of feminist  principles is systemic (widespread) and I  think we must continue to fight where it is  necessary.  Most women in the CCD are DAWN  Canada members though, and are very  supportive of our issues if they get on the  agenda of the meeting. The fight, of course,  is to get them there. We have a written  agreement with the CCD to have DAWN  Canada work on all issues directly related  to women with disabilities.  Without the necessary funding, we  lack the resources to provide a gender  analysis on CCD policies and position papers. The work continues on this level. I  must say that I have learned to love and  respect most of the people there and I think  we have come a long way since the first  meeting I attended.  The evolution of DAWN Canada continues. Most regions have had funding cutbacks and we have seen many DAWN  groups fold (die). Sometimes, there are direct funding cuts such as the cutting of program funding to women's centres and local DAWN affiliate groups by Status of  Women Canada.  As well, our research suggests that  women are losing our will and ability to  participate in society due to cutbacks to  things like:  □ home care,  □ accessible transportation,  □ disability aides,  □ basic food and shelter allowances,  □ hospital services, and  Speaking Out For Safe and Respectful  Health Care for Women  COMMUNITY  HEALTH  ADVOCATES  There are 10 Volunteer Advocates helping women in  various communities of the Vancouver/Richmond Region.

This has hurt us and it  erodes (grinds away) the gains we have  painstakingly (with great hardships) made.  We have, by sheer necessity, broadened  our network through contact with individual women with disabilities wherever  they find themselves fighting to survive.  Some have become part of the network  through various disability groups, others  through women's groups, transition houses  and other feminist projects. Still, others find  us wherever someone has left a pamphlet,  project report or newsletter.

Dr. Jane Kelsey, an economist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, has  developed the following list of proposed tactics and strategies to resist the corporate agenda:  1. Be sceptical about fiscal and other "crises."  Examine the real nature of the problem, who defines it as a crisis, and who stands to  gain. Demand to know the range of possible solutions, and the costs and benefits of each  to whom. If the answers are not forthcoming, burn the midnight oil to produce the answers yourself.  2. Don't cling to a political party that has converted to neo-con-  servatism.  Fighting to prevent a social democratic party's capture by right-wing zealots is important. But once the party has been taken over, maintaining solidarity on the outside  while seeking change from within merely gives them more time. When the spirit of the  party is dead, shed the old skin and create something new.  3. Take economics seriously.  Neo-liberal economic fundamentalism pervades everything. There is no boundary  between economic, social, environmental or other policies. Those who focus on narrow  sectoral concerns will lose their battles and weaken the collective ability of the rest. Leaving economics to economists is fatal.  4. Expose the weakness of their theory.  Neo-liberal theories are riddled with dubious assumptions and internal inconsistencies. Expose them as self-serving rationalizations which operate in the interest of the elites.  5. Expose the masterminds.  Name the key corporate players behind the scenes, document their interlocking roles  and allegiances, and expose the personal and corporate benefits they receive.  6. Maximize every obstacle.  Federal systems of government, written constitutions, legal requirements and regulations, supranational institutions like the International Labour Organization and the  United Nations, and strong local governments can provide barriers that slow down the  pace of corporate take-over.  7. Maintain the concept of an efficient public service.  Build support among client groups and the public which stress the need for public  services and the risks of cutting or privatizing them.  8. Encourage community leaders to speak out.  Public criticism from civic and church leaders, folk heroes and other prominent  "names" makes corporate and political leaders uncomfortable. It also makes people think.  9. Avoid anti-intellectualism.  A pool of academics and other intellectuals who can expose the fallacies and failures  of the corporate agenda, and develop viable alternatives in partnerships with community and sectoral groups, is absolutely vital. They need to be supported when they come  under attack, and challenged when they fail to speak out or are co-opted or seduced.  10. Develop alternative media outlets.  Once the mainstream media are captured by the right, it is difficult for critics to enter  the debate, and impossible to lead it. Alternative media and innovative strategies must  be put in place.  11. Raise the levels of popular economic literacy.  Convince people that economic policy affects everyone and that alternatives to the  corporate agenda do exist.  12. Hold the line.  The corporate take-over is not yet complete. Social programs have not yet been entirely dismantled. Unions have not yet been destroyed. Not all environmental protections have been eliminated. There is still time, through sustained and coordinated action,  to hold the line.  from PROVOCATION page 9  The defence of provocation at work  The defence of provocation is based  on the idea that the accused loses control  and can't refrain from his desire to kill. In  fact, what happens in the spousal femicide  cases is that the accused loses control over  his wife, girlfriend,ef cetera, and killing her  is the way he tries to get control back.  "It's ironic that we say defence of  provocation shows compassion for loss of  control," says Cote. "What it really shows  is compassion for a man who takes extreme measures not to lose control."  One of the politically disturbing  things about this defence is that it is based  on what is called an "objective test." How  would an "ordinary person" have reacted  given such circumstances?  "[The verdict in the Stone case says]  an ordinary person would have been so  provoked by the behaviour of the victim  that he would have been pushed to kill,"  says Cote. "This normalizes the violence."  What is also worrisome is the scope  of "wrongful acts" or "insults" accepted  as being provocative. "In our case law, it's  often situations of women leaving men,  telling them they're unsatisfied with the  relationship, or that they're bad lovers,"  says Cote. "I've seen other cases where  women threaten to file criminal charges  against men who abuse their kids and this  is seen as provocation."  Essentially, women breaking free from  violent relationships or asserting their own  autonomy—all of which threaten a man's  control—are deemed to be provocative.  The common law provocation defence  What's even more worrisome is a  more recent invention: the common law  defence of provocation. [This defence was  invoked in the Klassen case by the jury in convicting him of manslaughter, not murder.]  Often in criminal law, says Cote, defence lawyers and judges invent new defences—they broaden the criminal law in  very creative ways—in crimes of violence  against women.  The first time the common law defence  of provocation was accepted was in 1994 in  the Wade case, heard before the Ontario  Court of Appeal. Wade's wife told him she  was leaving him. That night, she went to  sleep in her daughter's room. He later came  in and attacked her. She managed to get  away and run outside, but Wade caught up  to her. He smashed her head on the  sidewalk, killing her.  In his defence, Wade argued he was so  angry when she told him she was leaving  him that he went into a rage. He didn't even  think about what he was doing.  As opposed to the Criminal Code  (statutory) defence of provocation, the common law defence does not have an "objective test." All the accused has to do is prove  he was so angry he didn't know what he  was doing.  The provocation can go to the very basic level of intent, says Cofe. To be found  guilty of murder, you have to commit the  homicide intentionally. The common law  defence says provocation goes to the possibility of forming criminal intent—you get  so angry you don't even contemplate the  consequences of your actions; you just lash  out. [No intent. No murder.]  What must be done  Shelagh Smith, who was Susan  Klassen's best friend, says the defence of  provocation, in the Criminal Code and common law, should be abolished. "It shouldn't  be available in today's society," says Smith.  "The justice system is supposed to hold people responsible. Provocation gives people an  excuse."  Smith adds that the category of self-defence needs to be expanded to recognize the  situation many women who have killed or  injured their intimate partners find themselves in. "There's a double standard. If a  woman kills for fear of her life, that isn't  seen as provocation; it doesn't fit with the  patriarchal definition of provocation."  The local newspaper in Whitehorse reported that after the Klassen verdict, the  Victims Services and Family Violence Prevention Unit (FVPU), an agency of the Yukon government, received numerous calls  from women. Some women said their partners used the verdict as a threat: "Five years  is nothing."  A spokesperson from the FVPU was  also quoted as saying the agency had received a number of calls from men who had  been court-ordered into its Anger Management Program. These men said that if they  knew they'd only get five years, they  wouldn't have taken the program.  Brenda McDonald agrees that the  provocation defence needs to go. She says  Ralph Klassen used Bert Stone's case at his  own sentencing hearing. Klassen's lawyer  argued that Stone only got seven years for  stabbing his wife 47 times, so his client  should serve even less time, given his act  wasn't as "brutal." Since then, Klassen's  case has been used in other trials of men  kill women, says McDonald. "He has  helped other violent men get off."  Last Fall, the federal Department of Justice put out a consultation paper on three  issues: the defence of provocation, self-defence, and defence of property. Joanne  Klineberg, counsel with Criminal Law Policy  at the Department of Justice, says the impetus for the review was years of study and  public interest. The goal is legislative change.  Klineberg says the Department is still  looking through the responses, and so far,  there is no clear consensus on what to do.  Andree Cote says most of the reforms  proposed by the Justice Department would  make the conditions for successfully claiming provocation less strict. The reasoning  often suggested for broadening the defence  of provocation is so that "battered women"  who kill their husbands, but can't claim  self-defence, can use it, says Cote.  She finds this a very disturbing way of  addressing the situation of battered women  who kill. "[Battered women] rarely kill out  of anger; they kill mostly to preserve their  lives or the lives of their children," says  Cote. "To say you're going to broaden the  defence of provocation for battered women  who kill is a cynical way of using the situation of battered women to effect a reform  that would in fact benefit violent men."  Cote says there is a whole lot for feminists to discuss concerning the defence of  provocation and self-defence. She adds it  is important that a feminist critique of the  issues and of other criminal law matters be  developed. It is critical particularly to counter the heavy-handed law-and-order solutions being promoted and accepted.  Feminist anti-violence activists and legal scholars will be meeting in Ottawa in  July to discuss the defence of provocation,  self-defence, and minimum mandatory  sentencing. The forum is hosted by the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry  Societes, an organization that advocates on  behalf of women in conflict with the law  and that works on law reform.  Kinesis will continue to follow the developing feminist analysis of legal issues  related to violence against women.

KINESIS  JULY/AUGUST 1999 Womyn Warriors play ball on film:  Getting to the Games  by Nadine C. King  WOMYN WARRIOR  written and directed by Patrice Leung  Golden Orchid Productions  Vancouver, BC, 1999  Summer 1997. The question was  posed: How can the Womyn Warriors get  to Amsterdam for the Gay Games '98?[see  Kinesis July/August 1997] Did 30,000 lesbians and a few good gay brothers donate a  buck each to help the Warriors fulfill this  dream?  Who are the Warriors anyway? [Think  softball. Think women of colour. Think the  Mabel League, the lesbian softball league in  Vancouver.]  For those of you wondering, "Did they  make it?," filmmaker Patrice Leung, a Warrior herself, answers that question and  more in her new 48-minute video on the  team.  From Vancouver to Holland, the  Womyn Warriors are a group of women negotiating with race, sexuality and competitiveness as they get out there and  goddammit, Play balll  In her documentary, Leung  queries out loud: "What service do we as the Warriors provide to the community?" As a  fan for six years, I'll pipe up to  say the Warriors were an integral part of my coming out  process. How so?  Flashback to the Summer of  1993: six months after coming  out as a lesbian, I'm branded as  crazy because I'm not willing to  give up my own virgin...views  and kiss enough political  as...egos. Caught between the  political rock and a lousy Friday  night bar space, somehow I  heard about groups of lesbians  playing ball. My strongest  memory of that summer is the  Mabel League tournament at  49th and Victoria, where I  screamed myself hoarse cheering on the Warriors to a well-  deserved victory.  Everything I'd hoped to see  in this new community of mine  was on the field—their very  presence was political! In a Local Majority sea [of whiteness,]  the team was an island of  mostly World Majority women  pulling together with a commitment to  highs, lows and a few fly balls in between.  Ahh, but enough reminiscing!  The team first got together in the early  '90s. Over the years, they haven't always  won, but I'll bet they have more "Most  Sportspersonship" awards than any other  team. This reputation for politeness is one  their oft-chosen MVP, Karrie, scoffs at. "I  don't think we're polite. We are mouthy  and we're noisy."  Yes, they have great team spirit but like  any team, the Warriors are not immune to  the trials and tribulations of bringing 20  women together into one groove. Leung's  video touches on the difficulties within the  team that brought on turbulent group  weather and broke the first wave of cohesion. A few folks left, a few more joined, a  few folks thought about leaving...but didn't.  After the team refocused itself and  brought in Lise Delvecchio as coach, they  embarked on raising funds to get to the Gay  Games '98. A VanCity donation, a Bowl-a-  rama, an auction, and a food booth at the  Vancouver Folk Music Festival, were the big  money-makers. Tons of fun for the Warriors' supporters, but it probably tested the  team members' commitment, since the 30  grand they needed ain't pittance...  Leung's video mixes interviews with  core members of the Womyn Warriors,  along with black and white clips from previous years. The team has always been predominantly women of East Asian descent.  It's easy to be a  Womyn Warriors fan.  Even if you don't get the  rules of the game, you  can still admire women  for their particular skills.  To name a few: Trish, my  favourite femme (that's  with a capital F) on the  team, who I've watched  bloom into an excellent  fielder. Paulina for her  stealth as a base-stealer.  Patrice for her ability to  catch and hunt down  base stealers. (If you've  watched her play you  know what I mean).  Maggie for her shortstop  skills, excellent hand-eye reflex and throwing arm. Cynthia for her big booming bat,  and last but not least, Lily, the team's main  pitcher over the years.  Womyn Warrior zooms through clips of  a few of the team members discussing their  sense of self, Canada, how softball became  Patrice Leung checking out the sights  to play ball: the Womyn Warriors (and a few friends) in Amsterdam  However, there were other brown women—  Amanda, Mary-Lou, Heather, Corey and  Sandi—women of Haida, Filipina and Afro-  Caribbean heritage, to name a few.  One has to smile with the two core  players of European descent, Anne and  Trish, who note the irony of being "invisible" on a team of colour to other ballplayers in the League.  part of their life and racism, on and off the  field. Occasionally, the imagery and the  voice-overs are a bit confusing, especially  if one doesn't know whose face to match  to the words.  I would have loved to have seen some  more'round-the-table-after-the-game-sup-  per scenes to give you the sense of camaraderie I know exists on the team. Still, there's  plenty of chuckles! Leung has chosen some  great shots of the women in action, and  good editing helps move the film along for  those of you who do not have the patience  to watch a ball being tossed and whacked  around repeatedly.  The footage from Amsterdam gives a  sense of the grandness of the Gay  m       Games'Commencement Ceremony  ■ but sadly the video does not include  any footage of the Warriors playing.  i There's a few shots of their accom-  ■ modations, a dinner-time close-up or  I two, and a nice piece of commentary  j about "where the girls are," as they  ! watch a parade on the canal.

It had been published in Kinesis  10 years earlier in our November 1988 issue.  As summertime approaches, we're feeling in a  particularly sporty mood [see also page 21,]  so we thought we'd re-print Jackie Brown's review o/Shooting Stars, a film about a team of  women basketball players, the Edmonton  Grads. We feel it's important to recognize the  unrecognized accomplishments of women in all  aspects of life, including sports [and science,  see page 19.] So here it is...  For 25 years, they were the team to  beat.  In Canada, they won every western  and national basketball championship and  lost only once at the provincial level.  Against US competitors, they won the  Canada/US Underwood Championship so  many times, they were permanently  awarded the series trophy in 1940. And they  went undefeated at four Olympics—winning all 27 exhibition contests against the  best players in the world.  They even won seven out of nine exhibition matches played against men's teams.  They were the Edmonton Grads, a  women's amateur basketball team that lost  only 20 out of 522 games for an incredible  96.2 percent average. From 1915 to 1940,38  players—all graduates from Edmonton  Commercial High School—made up the  various teams, setting records that remain  unbroken today.  Under the guidance of Percy Page, the  team's only coach and a rather stuffy sort  who preached the virtues of being ladylike  both on and off the court, the Grads were  models of consistency and fair play. There  were no fancy manoeuvres, trick shots or  spectacular slam dunks; just half a dozen  plays practised to perfection.  Opposing teams were treated with respect. So much so, that during a particularly close game against arch rivals the Tulsa  Stenos, a Grad silenced the rambunctious  crowd trying to rattle a Steno player about  to attempt a foul shot.  The Grads were, indeed, amazing. But  their accomplishments become all the more  phenomenal considering they did everything on their own.  Unlike so many of today's "amateurs"  who train and tour with the help of corporate sponsors or government aid, the Grads  worked full-time and held practices and  games at night. Tours coincided with vaca  tions, and the team relied on ticket sales  to pay travelling and other expenses.  Not that there weren't any perks. After winning the first Underwood Challenge in 1923, for example, ecstatic Edmonton merchants gave the team medals  and gifts (Coach Page got a brand new  Chevy) and the women did travel first-  class most of the time. They were also the  darlings of Edmonton society and barely  a day went without a mention in the social pages.  But for the Grads, fame and fortune  were secondary. Playing the game they  loved was enough. That, and forging  friendships which have endured for decades, have been their greatest rewards.  In 1940, the team played its last game  in front of a standing room-only crowd of  6,000 appreciative Edmontonians. They  won, of course. In 1973 and 1974 respectively, the team was inducted into the Edmonton and Alberta Halls of Fame. Coach  Page made it to the Canadian Hall of Fame  in 1971.  Today, the Grads are enjoying a resurgence in popularity thanks to a new National Film Board film called Shooting  Stars, which chronicles the team's rise to  international fame. Hopefully, it will help  set the record straight in a few areas. Great  though they were, the Grad's achievements drifted into obscurity. After all, who  pays much attention to Canadian athletes,  let alone a women's basketball team that  played in Edmonton over 40 years ago?  Consequently, some members of the  sporting world are making false  claims. Case in point: a US university  basketball team was recently labelled  a record-breaker for winning 61  games in a row. The Grads, however,  won 147 consecutive games.  One record book also states that  a professional male player's 56 foul  shots in a row is the all time high.  But Grad forward Margaret  McBurney sunk 61 in a row during  a 1931 exhibition game.  The lack of recognition doesn't  surprise McBurney (now Margaret I  Vasheresse) who says the attitude is  typical of the States.  "They even claimed they invented basketball but it was Dr.  James Naismith, a Canadian, who  invented it," said Vasheresse in a  recent interview.  Now 79 and living in New Westminster (she came to Vancouver in 1929),  Vasheresse is one of several ex-Grads featured in Shooting Stars. Although she modestly tries to play down the current publicity, with a little encouragement, her obvious pride in the team's achievements comes  through.  Says Vasheresse: "They were some of  my best memories. It was good times and  wonderful fellowship."  Asked to compare the sports scene  then and now, Vasheresse says today's athletes are under too much pressure to win  at all costs. Money, she adds, is the culprit.  "We wanted to win but Mr. Page always  said we were ladies first and basketball  players second. There wasn't that urgency  to beat someone badly or be rough. We  played for the love of the game..."  Shooting Stars was produced in 1987. It  was directed by Allan Stein and distributed  through the National Film Board.

Ash   THE LESBIAN EROTIC COOKBOOK  by Ffiona Morgan  Daughters of the Moon Publishing  Novato, California, 1998  Lesbians and food; lesbians in the  kitchen. What associations come up?  □ Fleeing the kitchen as a limited,  "feminine" domain?  O Recognizing the historic importance  of the kitchen as a central meeting place,  the hearth?  □ Lesbians on the cutting edge of vegetarian, organically-grown food?  □ Stereotypes: the vegetarian activist,  the fast-food eating working class dyke,ef  cetera!  D Embracing the kitchen as a place of  essential work that can be exciting,  sensual...sexy?  I've been interested in cooking for a  long time and frequently peruse cookbooks.  Finally, here is a cookbook where two important aspects of my life come together.  Yes, The Lesbian Erotic Cookbook is actually a cookbook focussing on food. There  is sexually explicit writing, but it acts as an  accompaniment to a main course of recipes. Ffiona Morgan writes in the preface:  "Good food is a celebration of life, and I  like to celebrate in any way that I  can...nourishing our bodies is a way to love  ourselves..."  Is there a lesbian cuisine? If there is,  it's rather eclectic. The cookbook has a mix  of North American standards and different  Americanized ethnic styles (Chinese, South  Asian, Jewish, Italian, Mexican). There are  plenty of basic recipes and a few "gourmet"  ones as well.  For the dyke who's kitchen-shy there's  an introduction to cooking and cooking  terms, and plenty of easy-to-make recipes.  There's also an introduction to bread-baking and a number of bread recipes.  Most recipes are vegetarian or vegan,  with a few chicken and seafood ones  thrown in. The recipes were assembled by  Morgan over many years, and some are  credited to specific people.  Woven around the recipes, there is a  regular smattering of erotic prose pieces  from a variety of authors, including  Morgan herself. The most well-known are  food-themed excerpts from Dorothy  Allison's work. The pieces that work the  best are those where the role of food (especially as part of sex play) is prominent.  1/2 tsp nutmeg  1/4 cup rice, soy or cow's milk  Almond slivers  Serves 4  2 bananas, frozen without peel  1 package firm silken-style tofu  6 tbsp maple syrup  2 tsp vanilla, or to taste  Optional: walnuts or pecans; 6 Tbsp crumbled cookie  In advance, freeze the bananas (without peels) and refrigerate the package of tofu. In a blender or food processor, add all the ingredients until  they are creamy and smooth, then pour the custard into a bowl or individual serving cups. Sprinkle them with almond, pecan or walnut slivers,  or crumbled cookie, and sprinkle your love with tofu kisses. Refrigerate  or serve immediately.  There are a couple of pagan ritual ones  which I found not quite as engaging.  (Morgan practises pagan/Goddess religion, so there is a dose of that sensibility  throughout the book).  The quality of the writing varies from  fair to funny, good and, well, erotic. There  are also lots of, dare I say, "yummy" photos of women and food. The women are in  various states of dress and undress, eating,  munching, smooching, et cetera.  The erotic theme continues throughout  the book. Morgan has given "naughty"  names to many of the recipes. A few examples: Creamy for You Tofu Custard, Oil  Over You Undressing, Undulating Eggplant Parmesan, Make Me Sweat Manicotti,  Kootchie Kugel... (You get the idea.)  The book is divided into breakfasts (I  find breakfast to be the most challenging  meal; it's hard to make something both interesting and palatable in the morning),  bread and sandwiches, soups and sauces,  salads and "undressings," the "main  squeeze" (entrees), and separate sections  for rice and pasta, tofu, chicken and seafood dishes.  The tofu section is a great bonus—I  haven't found many recipes that focus on  tofu itself, short of looking in a tofu cookbook. I got some new recipes to use, instead  of just adding some tofu cubes to a stirfry  The final section, of course, is dessert.  It's quite extensive and includes a recipe  for a chocolate body paint "living sundae"—the perfect recipe for an erotic cookbook.  There are also (suggestive) categories:  "quicky" "easy" and "leisurely." This allows one the choice of getting a meal ready  in a hurry, but also the option of a more  extensive cooking experience.  Don't let the words "gourmet recipes  for the innovative cook" on the title page  put you off. The Lesbian Erotic Cookbook is  actually a good introduction for those who  rarely venture into the kitchen. Some recipes are very simple; others are more complex. There are also basics like bread, pizza  sauce, pancakes, et cetera.  Morgan adds a lot of personal commentary to the recipes, which is fun and  interesting but sometimes a little odd—like  when she refers to vegetables as "little  girls." (Huh?) When she describes a sexual  fantasy involving a Chinese woman cook-  by Linda Buonocore  Makes 2-3 cups  1 large tangy apple> SUCh as a Granny Smith, peeled and cored  1 cup sunflower seeds, soaked a few hours and drained  1 cup filtered water; more, if needed  Optional: 2-3 tbsp honey, or to taste  wl^!

The book's square shape helps it stay  open fairly well. The layout is attractive,  with purple ink printing on the creamy (ha  ha) pages. The photos are not all of equal  quality, but overall add much to the book,  and there is other artwork/drawings in the  margins. It should be noted that the book's  photos are also predominantly (but not exclusively) of white women.  Being a determined researcher (and  procrastinating book reviewer), I determined to test some of these recipes myself.  Herewith my comments on the following  recipes:  G-spot Breakfast Pudding: I am not  usually a pudding fan, but this cornmeal-  based recipe won me over. It's not too sweet  and solidifies nicely for a good cold snack  as well.  Go Down Omelette: I admit it; I  cheated. I didn't separate the egg white and  add it later to make a fluffier omelette.  However, with the spinach, avocado, onion and mushroom filling, it is def'nitely  filling and pleasing, even without the  added fluffiness. The cookbook commentary notes that this is good for when "you  have had an active night and need some  intense protein for breakfast; besides, you  are starving... you know what I mean."  Say Yes Again Szechuan Peanut  Pasta Salad: A good cold summertime  meal: noodles with peanut sauce, fresh  herbs and veggies. I would add a touch less  sesame oil; it's a little strong (or maybe my  sesame oil was a little strong).  Bad Girl Tofu: Even my partner/girlfriend, who hates to cook, got into making  this recipe. It's basically breaded tofu slices  sauteed with a little tomato and melted  cheese on top.Yummm... and so easy.  Two-Finger Tofu: This tofu recipe is a  little more involved. It's tofu in a spicy (but  tame) peanut molasses banana sauce. Very  different. I actually made this twice (which  tells you how long I've been intending to  review this book). The first time it was absolutely delicious; the second, mediocre.  The quality of the bananas (perfect ripeness  is best) and the timing of the cooking seem  to make a big difference.  Road to Ecstasy Applesauce Bread: I  took this to my religious community's coffee time, and everyone loved it. The  applesauce makes it sooo moist.  Secret Fantasy Sunflower Creme  Sauce: This is a healthy alternative to  whipped cream (but not as fluffy), among  other things. In my opinion, though, it's an  acquired taste. For the diehard vegan. But  if you're not, give it a try anyway.  Boinkin Brownies: Wow! Really  moist, dense tofu brownies. A small piece  goes a long way. Definite seal of approval.  Alas, I still haven't tried the Apple  Brown's Nipples—no leftover cornbread.  There are a number of vegetable recipes—I just didn't try them—and, yes, there  is a lentil stew. Also, there are a great  amount of cake and especially pie recipes,  but no muffins! Are muffins a Canadian  thing? Well, it is an American cookbook.  There are a few recipes that call for a particular brand of ingredient not readily available in Canada.  As a note of irony, the book was printed  in Canada. Apparently Morgan/Daughters  of the Moon had trouble getting a publisher  in the US to do it. My review copy made it  past Canada Customs, though I did get  charged for inspection. Maybe they got  some new recipe ideas out of it.

Please get  your letter to us by the 18th of the month.  If you can, keep the length to about 500  words. (If you go way over, we might edit  for space.)  Hope to hear from you very soon.  Kinesis   MM*  /i-fipj'ruti'u>/t /irfrirl0<s   nl0/i<30  Dump provocation defense  I am asking all women to take up their pens in a stand of solidarity at the travesty of the outcome of Bert Stone's appeal from the  Supreme Court of Canada on May 27, 1999 [see this issue page  6.J The Supreme Court upheld the four-year sentence Stone  received in 1995 for killing his wife by stabbing her 47 times.  I am appalled at the nine judges' decision, but at the same time I  am not surprised because they had to base their decision on the  circumstantial evidence presented at the trial. My question is: is  there no way of opening up the case and having a re-trial based  on pertinent evidence that was not allowed into the courtroom at  trial?  Such as calling forth the following people: her counsellor, Leone  Konings of the Kelowna Family Centre who had counselled  Donna after Stone assaulted her months earlier, the man who on  October 17, 1993 heard Donna scream as she was on the hood  of Stone's Sunbird in the A&W parking lot in Winfield...and who  saw Stone hit Donna several times on the head and face, or the  Kelowna RCMP who had been called into the incident and who  also had a file on previous threats made to Donna by her husband.  If these people had been allowed to take the stand, they would  have shown that Stone's statement to the jury that "he never  struck his wife or became angry at her before he killed her"  [The Kelowna Daily Courier, October 24, 1995) was a lie. I  believe that the outcome of the trial would have been different  given the above information.  As Debra Linger of Kelowna states: "How long are we going to  offer the offender protection while the victims (wives and children) are forced into lives of hardship, poverty and fear?" We as  Canadian citizens must take a stand against violence through our  courts showing that we do not tolerate violence. Laws must be  changed to ensure that the victim(s) are heard, and in cases  where they cannot speak out for themselves, that they are heard  through those who represented them in our community and who  have valuable information to share regarding the case at hand.  I find it hard to believe that one judge gets to determine what is  admissible evidence and what is not. I believe that a panel made  up of an odd number of judges should make the decision as to  what is admissible and what is not.  Also, I believe that a serious look is needed into the use of  provocation when applied to cases of violence. For example, in  the Stone case, it was argued that he was provoked into committing the crime by his wife's verbal attack on him about his sexual  performance. I really have to question if this is grounds to murder  someone. If it is, our society is in a very sorry state.  As Paula Kleiman of Oyama states: "Can we even begin to  imagine the fear and sense of hopelessness this sentence must  instill in victims of abuse?" This is a question we as a society  must really look at and decide what needs to be done in order to  ensure the safety of all.  -  (kreetinas,  'ñ†i\ere in Uew Zealand, I aw en'yOyinA receiving wy wOnthly Kinesis, Ct rewinder 0^  howe, and all the Issues ft0'lnft 0"> Here.

For the sake of justice, I am asking you to pick  up your pen and write a letter to the following  people, so our voices will be heard loud and  clear that, as women, we want changes made to  the judicial system to ensure that sentencing of  domestic violence will no longer result in a  mere slap on the wrist.
