"Women don't get much brains  before they're 30", he said in a September 2  ruling. This time, he may not get away with  it.  In the ruling, Bewley described two female  witnesses as "a bunch of clucking females",  "silly, stupid girls", "nubile females" who  were "no angels either". The case concerns  a man who kicked down the door to his ex-  girlfriend's home and dragged her at knifepoint into her bedroom. "No big deal,"  says the judge. "It isn't as if ... he threatened a policeman or something. He's demonstrating his manhood to a little girl."  It now looks as if the Judicial Council,  governing body for the provincial court  judges in B.C., may launch a judicial inquiry  The council has the power to recommend  that  Bewley be removed from the bench.  Chief Justice Lawrence Brahan confirmed  his intentions of going ahead with the  inquiry in a letter written November 4 to the  B.C. Federation of Women (BCFW), which  demands Bewley's dismissal. "Under the  Provincial Court Act," Brahan wrote, "I  shall commence an investigation." Bryan  Williams, President of the B.C. Branch of the  Canadian Bar Association is reportedly  "delighted" with Brahan's decision. If  Brahan backs down now, he's going to have  to do some fast talking.  Spokesperson for the BCFW, Lorri Rudland,  explained that group's decision to call for  Judge Bewley's dismissal. "His highly publicized remarks express a bias against women  which calls into question his ability to  adjudicate in an impartial and objective  manner. Assaults against women are justified as demoristrations of manhood and  women as a group are found to be deficient  in intelligence."  Bewley's supporters find him a barrel of  laughs. He's a town character, our very own  Judge Begbie (the 'hanging' judge), runs the  editorial defense in the Sun. What manner  of man is Les Bewley?  First, Bewley indicates no understanding of  the class nature of law. This, despite his  own working class background: his mother  scrubbed floors, his father was a blacksmith,  he dropped out of school and worked on an  . assembly line before taking night school  courses. In Bewley's analysis, the poor  break the law more often than the rich  because "there are more genetically disabled  and more economically disadvantaged and  more stupid people among the poor." He  has assimilated the ruling class version of his  own background.  Once Bewley told a pregnant welfare recipient, charged with assaulting her caseworker  because of frustration over welfare red-tape,  that she should look in the garbage can if she  wanted something to eat. Referring to the  fact that the woman lived common-law,  Bewley said, "Nobody asked her to go to  bed with a man. It may be good enough for  the barnyard, although animals have more  dignity." to page 2  PETITION  FOR  BEWLEY'S  DISMISSAL  B  i ^  I  M  I  N  ■Br  I  pEspm  \__ Uf ^___\'s-- ~            ___  BRr j "*  Kffcl  W^Mi  __&*_____  1W3?  |]     mm            t  J«<  ■lUr  m  s  T  R  I  K  E  BIMINI       STRIKE  BIMINI       STRIKE  Margot   Holmes,   striking   Bimini   worker,  speaks at the rally.  BIMINI       STRIKE  BIMINI       STRIKE  On Saturday, November 19, the strikers and  their union SORWUC held a rally to spread  the word about the strike.  Union members and supporters marched  from 6th & Burrard to the Indian Centre on  Vine Street. The rally was full of good  energy and picketers were signed up for the  weeks ahead.  Margot Holmes, SORWUC member and  striking Bimini worker, stressed that the  strike is a union issue, a waitress issue, a  human  rights  issue  and  a customer issue.  "There will always be waitresses," she pointed out. "It does not follow from this that  waitresses will always work under poor conditions:   without   respect   and   at   manage  ment's mercy. Conditions will change  because waitresses are struggling for those  changes. A union contract and a union shop  will allow waitresses to stand up together to  gain job stability and respect."  She also pointed out that customers cannot  be neutral. 85% - 95% of customers are  respecting the picket line.  Pat Barter of SORWUC and Melody Rudd of  AUCE also spoke in support of the strike.  Sue Moore of Vancouver Status of Women  explained that we see the strike as a vital  issue. "Women spend an average of 34 years  in the labour force," she explained. "The  only way we are going to make those 34  years tolerable is by unionizing with a democratic union like SORWUC." to page 3  -OAKALLA INQUIRY MUST BE PUBLIC -  B.C. Attorney General Garde Gardom  announced November 16 that a joint RCMP-  Corrections Department inquiry had been  launched into allegations of abuse of female  prisoners by male guards at Oakalla. The  substance, not the details, of the report will  be made public, Gardom said.  "This investigation must be completely  public," commented Claire Culhane of the  Prisoners' Rights Groups. "At present the  inquiry is composed of an RCMP officer and  two representatives ' from the Attorney  General's department. They are investigating themselves. There are no women involved in the inquiry, and not a single representative of a citizens' or community group."  Culhane also pointed out that prison conditions hit the headlines for a few days.  When the issue has fallen from the news,  those conditions continue.   It is known that  there are women in Oakalla who are in need  of urgent medical attention and who are not  receiving it. It is also known that women  prisoners spend more than the legal 15 days  in solitary.  "The problems of sexual offenses against  female prisoners are nothing new," said  Lorri Rudland, spokesperson for the B.C.  Federation of Women. The Federation has  called upon Gardom to make the inquiry  into conditions at Oakalla women's prison  public.  B.C. Federation of Women demands that  male guards be removed from the day-today living areas of the institutions where  contact with women prisoners would be an  infringement of the prisoners' basic rights  to privacy. They have also demanded that  women prisoners always be accompanied by  a female guard when it is necessary for them  to be moved outside the prison system. HUMAN   RIGHTS  page,!  WARNING TO GAY PEOPLE  ON BILL C-24  The new federal bill amending the Immigration Act, Bill C-24, contains a clause which  ends discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation against persons visiting or immigrating to Canada.    This is a positive step.  But it would be a mistake to support the bill  because of this clause. With the passage of  the bill, there is greater scope than ever  before for racial discrimination and political  harassment. All non-citizens, for example,  who support the overthrow of dictatorships  such as the Chilean Junta or the Smith  regime in Rhodesia are subject to immediate  action by the Special Advisory Board. This  Board will have vast, arbitrary powers and it  will not be subject to appeal or review. See  Sections 6(1), 8(1), 9(4), 11(2), 12(3),  14(1,2,3), 19(1,3), 10(1) and 27(3) for  specifics of this Act.  While gay people may now be granted entry  into Canada regardless of sexual orientation,  it is still possible to be denied entry on the  grounds of race or political orientation.  DO NOT SUPPORT BILL C-24!  MALE WORK DOMAIN CHALLENGED  Billie Lee Linton worked as a packer at  Nabob Foods in Vancouver from April 1973  to March 1976. All packers at Nabob Foods  are women.  In March 1976, Ms. Linton bid for a job as  an order-selector in the warehouse and was  awarded the position on the basis of seniority. Ms. Linton is the second woman in the  plant to work as an order-selector in the  warehouse.      All  other  order-selectors  are  Ms. Linton worked 19 days as an order-  selector and was demoted. Ms. Linton  alleged in making her complaint to the  Human Rights Branch that her demotion  was the result of sex discrimination. Nabob  Foods denies that Ms. Linton was discriminated against and maintains Ms. Linton was  demoted for poor performance. Ms.  Linton's transfer from packer to order-  selector was a move from a traditionally  female work area to a traditional male work  At the Board of Inquiry, held in June and  July 1977, evidence showed that the  employer (Nabob Foods), the union (Canadian Allied Manufacturers Wholesale and  Retail Union), and the Workers' Compensation Board had entered into an agreement  which indicated that certain duties in the  warehouse were considered too physically  strenuous for women to perform. One of  these designated duties was one of the job  functions of order-selector, the position in  which Ms. Linton was working at the time.  The questions raised by this complaint are:  1. Can an employer, with the agreement of  a union and the Workers' Compensation  Board, treat all women as a group without  individual assessment of their physical  abilities?  2. Did Ms. Linton receive training and  evaluation in a traditionally male job that  was untainted by discriminatory attitudes?  The Human Rights Branch is expecting a  decision on this case any day now. Watch  for an update in next month's Kinesis.  HUMAN RIGHTS DAY  WHAT DO WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE?  The Human Rights Act  The Human Rights Act (Canada) received  Royal Assent on July 14, 1977 and plans to  be in some kind of action by January 1,  1978.  Gordon Fairweather was appointed Chief  Commissioner and Rita Cadieux as Deputy  Chief Commissioner. Inger Hansen, a lawyer  (and previously ombudsperson for inmates  of federal penitentiaries) is the privacy commissioner. In an interview, Mr. Fairweather  stated that the guidelines for "equal pay for  work of equal value had been established",  but could not yet be released as the other  members of the Commission (four part-time  commissioners)  had  yet  to  be  appointed.  EEOC At City Hall  The Equal Employment Opportunities Program was finally approved at City Hall. A  smaller version of what was planned, but a  start. Extensive advertising by the City in  major conservative newspapers across the  country resulted in a flood of applicants ...  the short list is down to three women and  five men.  december 10  human rights day  big deal!  *  sbtnvo  Sophie Rivera,  LNS  Theoretically, things should be getting better  ... the reality is that the wage gap continues  to increase and higher percentages of women  are found in jobs traditionally held by  women and traditionally lower paying.  This year saw the Human Rights Commission of B.C. go out on a long limb to support  GATE's appeal to the Supreme Court of  Canada. They are doing this in order to try  to save the concept of "reaonsable cause",  which was effectivelv curtailed by a B.C.  Supreme Court decision. "Reasonable  cause" is the one concept which made B.C.  human rights' legislation distinctly better  than that in other provinces.  VSW members have been invited to participate in a meeting to review our organization's achievements this past year and to  draw attention to what we consider to be  the abuse or denial of human rights here in  British Columbia, in Canada, or anywhere in  the world. The meeting will convene at 7:30  pm at Langara College Auditorium on  Friday, December 9. Any member wishing  to participate in that meeting should contact  us at 736-3746, or the Human Rights Council at 731-4647.  This could be us, if we  more on BEWLEY . .  Indeed, Bewley has all the hallmarks of an  old-time patriarch. Justice is his, and his  alone, to dispense, and he resents the police  when they usurp his authority. His merciful  sentencing, likewise, is the strong father's  prerogative.  Les Bewley has been getting away with  sexism for a long time. As a judge with the  provincial court, he rules on a host of  criminal cases without a jury. He is, moreover, protected from critics by judicial  power to charge them with contempt.  Response to his latest outburst has been  significant. The conservative columnists  of both Vancouver dailies defend him with  their usual dismal rhetoric. But the Sun,  in particular, has been deluged with letters  to the editor demanding Bewley's dismissal.  PETITION  The B.C. Federation of Women has drawn  up a petition which it is circulating throughout the province. It reads:  We, the undersigned, request that Judge  Bewley be relieved of his office of Provincial  Court Judge. Judge Bewley's highly publicized derogatory remarks against women  reflect a bias which renders him incapable  of adjudicating in the impartial and objective  manner that ALL residents of this province  have a right to respect.  If you agree with the petition's demands,  drop by VSW and sign it. We will send you  a copy of the petition if you call us  (736-3746), or write VSW, 2029 West 4th  Avenue, Vancouver. page 3  SORWUC STRIKE  CRISIS AT TRANSITION HOUSE  When is a union not a union?  When it's got lots of women in it, and when  it's organizing in territory you regard as your  own.  Thus runs the thinking of local 40 of the  Hotel,   Restaurant  and   Bartenders'  Union.  The employees at Bimini's neighbourhood  pub on West 4th Avenue have certification  with SORWUC (Service, Office and Retail  Workers Union of Canada). SORWUC is a  small independent union dedicated to  organizing the unorganized, predominantly  women.  The workers at Bimini's have been on strike  since October 20, 1977. The employer has  so far been unwilling to agree to even a basic  union contract.  The Hotel, Restaurant and Bartenders'  Union don't think SORWUC is a real union,  and therefore do not respect the picket line.  They have gone behind the picket line at the  pub to sign up the scabs. John Phillips, the  local's Vice-President, says he regards  SORWUC not as a trade union but as a  women's liberation organization. He visited  the SORWUC office and threatened that if  SORWUC did not get out of "his" jurisdiction,  his union  would  destroy  SORWUC.  On November 25, SORWUC put up an information picket in front of local 40's office.  "If local 40 is so concerned with the rights  and problems of working women and men  within the jurisdiction it so jealously claims  as its 'private' territory, why don't they get  on with organizing them?" commented  SORWUC. "There are thousands of unorganized hotel and restaurant employees in  B.C. alone, so why are they spending the  dues of their members to destroy a union  they say does not exist?"  Union response to the action of the bartenders' union has been strong. Jack Munro,  regional president of the International  Woodworkers of B.C., told Jan O'Brien of  The Province: "The lowest form of humanity that exists is a scab, and how any so-  called respectable trade union can go and  even talk to them, never mind sign them up,  is a complete and total disgrace."  SORWUC has called upon the bartenders'  union to withdraw its application to represent   employees   at   Bimini's   immediately.  UPDATE  After meeting with the B.C. Federation of  Labour, the Bartenders Union backed down.  They have now withdrawn their application  for certification. Negotiations between  Bimini workers and management continue.  The pleasure of your company on the picket  line is still requested!  Auniancard  i$ the be£t  prdcCtiori  against  •rctertion.  ptfotUMLIBERATION NEWSSERVICE.  The Issues  The workers at Bimini's went out on strike  because the employer was unwilling to agree  to even a basic union contract.  Here's his position:  — vacations:  only what the law allows  — seniority: combined with 'merit'  — sick leave: none!  — scheduling: entirely up to management  — union   security:   No!   non-negotiable  — promotions and training: the employer  will choose on merit  — wages: last offer for waitresses: $3.00  Trainee, $3.25 Probation, $3.50  Permanent  Here's some of the contract proposals that  are important to the Bimini workers:  1. Union shop, ie. after being hired at  Bimini's, a new employee joins the union.  (The tactic of the employer has been to keep  the staff divided with promises for some and  discrimination against others. If we are to  work as a team again, the union cannot be  used to separate us.)  2. One (1) day paid sick leave per month, ie.  12 per year.  3. Three (3) weeks vacation after 12 months  service.  4. Leave of absence without pay for personal reasons. If extended leave is required  (more than two months), the employee is  placed on the recall list if her/his position is  not available.  5. Say in scheduling — loss of hours and  changes of shifts are sometimes used as a  disciplinary measure.  6. We are asking for $6.00 to $7.50 per  hour for all job categories other than waitress. This includes categories already being  paid these wages and those who do not make  tips. For waitresses we are proposing $5.10  to start and $5.60 per hour after four  months.  GAY  The Gay Alliance Towards Equality (GATE)  made application to appeal to the Supreme  Court of Canada on Monday November 21.  High court acceptance had been considered  likely, due to the fact that the judgement  against GATE at the B.C. Court of Appeal  had had one judge dissenting from the  majority opinion.  The case concerns a complaint which GATE  had laid under the B.C. Human Rights Code  against the Vancouver Sun, which had  refused to run an ad advertising Gay Tide,  GATE's newspaper.  RIGHTS  decision due  The B.C. Human Rights Commission ordered an inquiry, which declared that the Sun  must accept the ad. The Sun appealed that  decision to the B.C. Supreme Court, and  lost. However, their subsequent appeal, to  the B.C. Court of Appeal, ruled in favour of  the Sun.  At that judgement, Justice A.E. Brance  claimed that although the Sun had been  biased, the bias was reasonable, because  honestly entertained.  VSW received the following information  from Transition House:  Since the passage of Bill 65, abolishing the  Vancouver Resources Board, we, the Transition House staff, have been awaiting some  official notification from the Ministry of  Human Resources, as to our status under the  new system. This notice could be directed  either to ourselves or to our union,  SORWUC. Almost all other VRB employees  have been accorded this notice — through  the Joint Council of the VRB unions. We are  not, however, part of that joint council.  We have been doing our utmost to force the  issue: through submissions to the Labour  Relations Board and discussions with the  B.C. Government Employees Union (which  will be absorbing the VRB employees). But  no one seems willing or able to tell us where  we stand.  Meanwhile, rumours abound that the government would prefer that Transition House  become incorporated as a non-profit society.  At Transition House we absolutely oppose  such a move.  When the VRB came into existence, they  also tried to get us to make that move, but  we felt it was very important for Transition  House to become an integral part of the  social services delivery system. When the  LRB certified SORWUC as the union to  represent us, the VRB finally came round.  There is no doubt that Transition House has  proven one of the VRB's most valuable  resources: a refuge for women in crisis,  particularly battered wives. If we cannot  continue within the system (as we did while  the VRB existed), then it undoubtedly  means that we will be at the mercy of  obtaining community grants.  If we are to be judged by how the other  transition houses in B.C. operate, we would  have a serious cutback in staff. We would  not be able to staff the house around the  clock as we do at present. We see this as a  grave danger to the security and safety we  presently offer our residents. We need to be  on the spot for intake. We cannot predict  the times when the need for our facility  arises. Women come to Transition House at  all hours of the day and night.  Write to Mr. Vander Zalm, Minister of  Human Resources, with copies to Premier  Bennett, and Rosemary Brown, opposition  critic for Human Resources. Demand clarification of our status and urge for the  continuance of Transition House within the  ministry.  Vander Zalm now talks about a new  program of prevention for family violence:  workers right in the house of troubled  families. We all know that troubled families  don't always seek help until the breaking  point — and in most cases, would object to  having someone work with them in the  home as an invasion of their privacy.  WRITE TODAY  VANDER ZALM PIED  A woman from the Anarchist Party of  Canada (Groucho Marxist) shovelled Human  Resources Minister Vander Zalm a banana  cream pie at the annual Socred Convention  recently. Right in the face.  The party took action on behalf of all those  whom Vander Zalm treats rottenly: welfare  recipients, single mothers, mental patients,  the handicapped, native people and Quebec. VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN  A NATIONAL DAY OF PROTEST  Women and men marched, talked and listened in major cities across Canada Saturday,  November 5th as part of a national day of  protest  opposing violence against  women.  The marches, demonstrations and workshops  — held in cities including Ottawa, Toronto,  Vancouver, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon  and Edmonton — protested the growing incidence of rape, both in the streets and in the  home, battering, sexual harassment of  women on the job, and the media portrayal  of women as victims.  Among the themes which emerged from the  national day of protest were:  — Rape is less an attempt to gain sexual gratification than a way of asserting power,.*©f  dominating and humiliating the victim.  — Rape should be re-defined in the Criminal  Code, possibly as assault rather than sexual  violation, so convictions could be gained  more easily.  — Women should learn the physical and  psychological skills of self-defense.  — Women, rather than politicians, police and  social service agencies, are going to ultimately have to erase the existing stereotypes of  men and women that are largely responsible  for violence against women.  TORONTO  The State Is The Biggest Rapist Of Them All  Women Against Rape and Wages for Housework in Toronto decided to hold an anti-  rape event on November 4th, to kick off the  activities planned by other groups for the  following day, and to take advantage of a  weekday crowd by creating a "honk-in"  against rape, attended by 200 people.  The "honk-in" was preceded by a booming  introduction by comedienne Lorna Bosch-  man, and a skit involving a narrator, a tap-  dancer who played "women" (Suzie Q in  particular), and a mustachioed woman who  represented various men, ending with a  cameo performance as government and  business. This street play follows Suzie Q  through her careers as single-woman-typist-  with-life long-dream-to-dance, full-time-  housewife, waitress, and hooker. It shows  the vulnerability and powerlessness that her  poverty puts her in. Each man she encounters — her husband, boss, customer, pimp  and John — becomes a rapist because of her  dependence on him for room or rent. In the  end, Suzie Q and Women Against Rape  triumph when they overpower Mr. Government and Business, who is busy counting  his (our) money. They take the money and  then they can dance ... really dance!  The suggestion of rape in marriage became  the theme of the day when Judy Ramirez  of the Toronto Wages for Housework Campaign and Women Against Rape alarmed  audience and reporters alike with her statement that "Rape, like charity, begins at  home." She said that when local Police  Chief Adamson advised women against  letting strangers into our homes, he hadn't  mentioned fathers, brothers, husbands and  'friends' — the familiar rapists, more  common than the back-alley attacker. She  made it clear that the State is the biggest  rapist of them all, because if we women were  paid our wages due, "we would be in a much  stronger position to resist the rapist in the  home and on the streets, who thinks he is  entitled to our bodies."  Baba Yaga,  left (dressed as a man), and Ellen  Agger in an anti-rccpe skit, RAPE IN TEE NAME  OF LOVE.  Toronto Wages for Housework group  presented the skit on the corner of Yonge and  Wellesley during lunch-hour, November 4th.  While men's eyebrows were still raised and  women were still nodding, Betty Burcher, a  participant in the London Tribunal, took  the megaphone to tell of the tremendous  excitement women in England had felt in  "coming out" against rape in all its forms.  Then the signs reading "Honk to Protest  Rape" were raised and paraded around the  busy Yonge Street intersection, causing  slight havoc and a loud finale!  Snuff Out Snuff  On November 5th, about 200 people attended daytime seminars at a community centre  and later marched downtown. The march  was capped by about 20 women rushing into  and closing a downtown theatre which was  showing Snuff, an American film showing  rape, torture and mutilation.  Snuff films, which have been becoming  increasingly widespread, involve filming  women, frequently kidnapped Mexican  women, being raped, tortured and then  killed. About 200 people stood outside the  theatre during the spontaneous rush inside.  Onlookers jostled with city police as 10  police cars and a paddy wagon stood by.  However, the theatre was open for business  again the following day.  OTTAWA  In Ottawa, about 100 women and a handful  of men marched through the centre of the  capital, carrying placards and chanting "Stop  violence against women". A spokesperson  said the purpose of the march was to let  victims of violence know that others are concerned about the way they are being treated.  Volunteers from the Ottawa Rape Crisis  Centre said physical and verbal abuse of  women in the city's downtown area have  increased dramatically in recent months.  Helen Levine, a representative from a local  halfway house for battered women, said it's  difficult for women to know when to fight  back because "we are taught to be docile,  submissive and dependent." She added that  although most women never suffer phyical  abuse, most women are battered one way or  another — financially, occupationally or  psychologically.  SASKATOON.  Saskatoon City Council, at a meeting held  October 24, joined with other city councils  across Canada in declaring November 5 as an  official Day of Action Against Rape.   The  motion was introduced in response to a  letter signed by various community and provincial groups, including Saskatoon Women's  Liberation, U.S.S.U. Women's Directorate,  Saskatchewan Federation of Labour, and  Planned Parenthood of Saskatoon.  About 200 people attended a seminar in  which speakers termed rape "just the tip of  the iceberg of sexism." Saskatoon feminist  Wessia Kolasinska said rape is a way to  humiliate and control the victim. "Rape  should be treated as a political act. It is a  part of the patriarchal system, an act by  which men ensure that women are kept  down and are too ashamed to talk about it."  She added, "We are taught that men are our  protectors: the man takes you out, pays for  your meals, opens the door, protects you  from other men. Then he can take you  home and rape you. Yes, men are our  'protectors', but who is protecting us from  our protectors?"  REGINA  In Regina, about 50 people gathered at the  city's public library to hear about what legal  recourse is available for rape victims, preventive measures, reasons why rape occurs and  personal accounts of how devastating rape  can be for a woman. Speaker Pat Cavanaugh  said rape exists because of sex role stereotyping. "Where men are trained to take  what they want sexually and women are  taught to be coy and not honest about their  sexuality, rape results,' she said, calling for  elimination of stereotypes, legal changes and  destruction of myths about rape. "Women  need to support each other and help realize  it is not we who are at fault but inhuman  sex role stereotyping," she said.  EDMONTON  In Edmonton, about 75 people attended a  panel discussion in which speakers called for  change in the restrictive definition of rape  now in the Criminal Code. They pointed  out that under existing law, a man cannot  technically rape his wife, even if they are  separated. Some speakers suggested that  maximum sentences for rape should be  reduced, to facilitate convictions, that a  woman's previous sexual background not be  admissible as evidence in rape cases and  that the legal definition of rape be enlarged  to include other sexual violations. Other  speakers urged women to learn self-defense  but to be wary of using weapons which  could be turned against them by the assailant     CUP page 5  WOMEN AGAINST RAPE - B.C. ACTIONS  How did this national day of protest come  about? _    ,  Gayla Reid  Throughout the country on November 5,  ad hoc groups calling themselves Women  Against Rape voiced their anger against the  horrendous oppression of rape.  This whole day of national protest  developed from the Nanaimo Women  Against Rape. With the endorsement of the  British Columbia Federation of Women,  they called for anti-rape actions on November 5 throughout B.C. Other women's  groups in Canada took up that energy. The  fact that B.C. women made something that  powerful happen is a proud and positive  achievement.  In Vanocuver, Women Against Rape was an  ad hoc group who coordinated their action  in solidarity with the BCFW actions,  although it was not itself an action of the  Federation.  Throughout B.C., Women Against Rape  groups held guerilla theatre and set up  informal booths in shopping malls, spoke  against rape on panel and open line shows,  held motorcades and community meetings.  Nanaimo, Victoria, Kelowna, Cranbrook  and Prince George have all reported successful actions.  The Vancouver action centerd on a tribunal  on the courthouse steps. This tribunal  indicted the institutions of this society  which foster, condone and benefit from  rape: the legal, educational, medical, and  religious institutions as well as the economy  and the media. Personal testimonies about  rape followed the indictments.  The orientation of the tribunal's script was  towards a critique of the patriarchy. This is  how the WAR collective described the  patriarchy:  In  a  patriarchy all men  oppress  women.  The patriarchy we live in sanctions Rape as  well as benefits from it.  Throughout history men have been socialized into the role of potential Rapist and,  likewise, women their victims. Society has  romanticised the images of sexuality and  Rape in all its art forms, including myths,  literature, and classical paintings. In the last  The Women Against Rape action outside the  Vancouver Courthouse, November 5th  category women have been portrayed as  either Virginal Madonnas or as Seductive  Temptress and, even as temptress, her role  has been passive. Men have been portrayed  as aggressive and dominant, protective of all  their property, including women. Masculinity has been constantly associated with  power, strength and violence until, in the  minds of people, they became one and the  same thing.  The WAR media policy is the statement  from WAR which received the most media  coverage. The policy, rather than comments  on rape, was featured in the daily papers.  "Women Against Rape Bar Male Cameraman  From Rally" ran one headline.  This is what the policy said:  STATEMENT OF MEDIA POLICY  The Women Against Rape collective have  outlined a policy which deals with the  representation by the media on the November 5th day of action.  These demands have to be met before any  interview or statement will be given.  Historically the media has trivialised and  misrepresented the women's movement. In  order to retain control over the media inter  pretation  of the   WAR  action,  our policy  must be totally adhered to.  We demand that:  1. Interviewers will be women we accept  as knowledgeable and supportive of our  position on rape.  2. In interviews given by the WAR media  representatives all technical crews be comprised solely of women.  3. Interviews to any media group will be  given only if WAR can have prior knowledge  of copy and program intent with editorial  control over final copy, programs, inserts,  news coverage or any other type of media.  4. All media coverage must be pre-taped. No  live interviews will be given before or on the  event.  At the Courthouse, WAR marshalls escorted  male reporters and photographers from the  scene.  The Women Against Rape action  WOMAN APPOINTED TO STUDY  NEEDS FOR RAPE RELIEF  What information and feelings do you have  on the issue of rape assaults?  What could/should happen in your community to provide services to victims of these  assaults — who, what, how should these  services be met?  What steps are being taken or could be taken  to provide education on rape assaults in your  community?  In B.C., we now have an opportunity to  lobby around these issues.  The B.C. Attorney General's Ministry has  created a temporary, five-month position to  develop an overview of the operation of rape  relief centres in B.C.  Nancy Goldsberry has been hired for the  job. She has worked for three years at Victoria's Rape Relief. Her mandate includes  the following: to assess the needs for rape  crisis/education/prevention services in every  B.C. community; to compare the cost of  non-governmental services to those government services which could be available in  the area; to recommend effective services for  sexual assault victims, dependent on  community resources and population.  Give Goldsberry all the assistance you can.  Contact her  at 525  Fort Street, Victoria. LEAVE IT TO B.E.A.V.E.R.  B.E.AV.E.R. (Better End All Vicious Erotic  Repression), a group affiliated with the  Wages for Housework Committee, is  Canada's first organizational voice for  prostitutes.  At a press conference on November 25, with  Margo St James of Coyote and Judy  Ramirez of the Wages for Housework  Committee, the group members explained  that they are organizing for the decriminalization, not legalization, of prostitution.  They explain why they think this is  necessary:  "The women's movement has long  recognized the importance of economic  independence for women. Right now in  Toronto, independent street walkers are an  endangered species. Wiping out sexploitive  work means wiping out potential jobs for  women. Cleaning up Yonge Street means  putting women on jail, on welfare, and into  competition with other women for regular  jobs. It disrupts families. Yes, hookers  raise children too.  Licensing of body rub parlours amounts to  de facto legalization and corporate pimping.  The Parlour owner(s) and government  "legally" take a large percentage of the  women's wages: they protect and profit  themselves while leaving the laws against the  prostitute intact, so she can still be busted,  particularly if she should attempt to work  independently on the street.  B.E.A.V.E.R., BETTER END ALL  VICIOUS EROTIC REPRESSION, is  Canada's first organizational voice for  prostitutes and other workers of the flesh,  i.e. strippers, porno actresses, and topless  anything. Prostitutes are coming together to  fight against the government's attempts to  take away their right to earn money in the  streets, and to gain recognition and respect  for their growing profession. Just as housewives are coming together to fight for their  wages too. We are fighting a common  cause!"  Baba Yaga, founder of B.E.A.V.E.R. says,  "Since I was a teenager, I have been  solicited, not only in sleazy streets and in  nightclubs, but everywhere, as all women  are. Small wonder that some of us take  advantage of the situation. I always wanted  to know, 'Does money objectify sex?' Yes  indeed it does. And if there is anything we  need to be more objective about — it's  sex. Women have been subjective in their  sexual expression to the point of suicide."  "CRUNCH NESTLE QUICK"  Members of the national Infant Formula  Action Coalition (INFACT) are backing a  nationwide boycott of Nestle products.  Their   slogan   is   "Crunch   Nestle   Quick".  Nestle is the largest seller of commercial  baby milks in the Third World and is the  focus of the campaign against infant formula  abuse.  Aggressive and often misleading promotional  campaigns encourage women to switch from  breast feeding to bottle feeding. These campaigns use media coverage, company-  sponsored "health and education programs",  false implications of medical endorsement,  and widespread dissemination of free samples in hospitals and clinics.  A recent survey of the hospital in Freetown,  Sierra Leone found that 713 of 717 babies  admitted for malnutrition were bottlefed.  Reasons for this have to do with safe use of  the formula. To use the formla safely the  parent must have access to clean drinking  wager, sterilization equipment, refrigeration,  literacy, and enough money to mix the  expensive powder in sufficiently nutritional  concentrations.  But such conditions are rare among the  people Nestle aims its ad campaign at in  the Third World. Thus the bottle and  formula become breeding grounds for bacteria, leading to infant diarrhea, malabsorption, malnutrition and death.  Why force bottle feeding on people who  have been breast feeding adequately (or at  least as well or better than the bottle feeding  in terms of nutrition and healthy babies)?  The Februrary 1977 issue of the Brazilian  publication Modern Supermarket, revealed  that processed infant and baby foods have a  profit margin of 72 percent — three to four  times the profit margins of nearly every  other item in the supermarket.  The boycott demands an end to all promotion of Nestle's artificial formula — through  mass advertising, distribution of free samples, milk-nurses and promotion in the  medical profession. It also demands that  artificial formula be prevented from getting  into the hands of people who lack the means  or facilities to use them safely.  People who boycott are urged to write  letters of protest to Nestle Co. Inc., 100  Bloomingdale Road, White Plains, New York  10605. Nestle's items to boycott include:  Taster's Choice coffee, Quik, Nescafe,  Nestea, Decaf, Crunch, Souptime & Lacto-  genj, all Libby's and Stouffer's products,  as well as Crosse & Blackwell's, Keiller,  Maggi, McVities, Crawford, James Keller  & Sons, Deer Park Mountain Spring Water,  and Jarlsburg & Swiss Knight cheese.  Reprinted from Off Our Backs — Info from  LNS  A.I.B.: ANTI WORKER; ANTI WOMEN  Toronto — "The Anti-Inflation Board is  anti-woman and anti-worker, and must be  scrapped."  Shelley Acheson, Human Rights Representative of the Ontario Federation of Labor,  joined other women from the Equal Pay  Coalition in lambasting the AIB for "perpetuating sex discrimination" in the workforce. The coalition held a news conference  at City Hall October 3.  The coalition is a group of representatives  from the labor movement, legal groups, and  women's organizations whose purpose is to  fight to raise wages in the female job ghettos  to levels comparable with wages in traditionally male-dominated jobs. The coalition has  more than 20 sponsoring organizations.  AIB regulations include a clause allowing for  pay increases in excess of AIB limits when  the increases are intended to remedy cases of  sex discrimination.  But in fact, charged Acheson, "the exemption is a farce." There is no clear case on  record where the AIB has granted a payment  to end sex discrimination.  After women workers at Winnipeg's Health  Sciences Center had struggled for two years  to win a catch-up increase, the AIB allowed  only half the increase that the workers and  the employer had agreed was necessary to  end discrimination against women workers.  HAN Su-Yin was in town November 20 to  speak about revolutionary China. Fantastic  presence!  Furthermore, the AIB's ruling did not  clearly state the grounds for the increased  payment, so there is no precedent on record  for women workers carrying on similar  struggles.  The AIB's system of percentage increases  helps increase the growing gap between men  and women workers, the coalition points  out.  In addition, the AIB uses a very obsolete and  narrow criterion for determining whether a  job should receive equal pay. Madeleine  Parent of the Confederation of Canadian  Unions told of the fight by the Canadian  Textile and Chemical Union for a catch-up  increase for women workers. The application  was turned down by the board.  An AIB official told the workers: "If the  union could point to two cashiers, one of  whom is male and is paid superior wages to a  female cashier, the exemption would have  been granted." Kate Alderdice  from Socialist Voice  NEW BRUNSWICK OCCUPATION  About 40 Maliseet Indian women are still  occupying the Federal Indian Services  Building in Tobique Narrows, New Brunswick.   The occupation began in late August.  The women are protesting a section of the  Indian Act which states that if an Indian  man decides to separate from his wife, he  has merely to order her and her children to  "get out of the house".  The law also allows a man to retain legal  ownership of the house after the wife and  children have been forced out.  Says one protester: "We have one woman  with 10 children who has been living in the  Arts and Crafts building since December  when her husband threw her out. The  government says it can do nothing."  The band council and federal government  have begun meetings to try and solve the  dispute. (Upstream/Hersay) page 7  40% HIGHER DEATH RATE  AMONG BIRTH CONTROL PILL USERS  New York (LNS) — A recent study of the  effects of oral contraceptives on women  sponsored by the British Royal College of  General Practitioners has concluded that  women who take the pill have a 40 per cent  higher death rate than women of the same  age who never used the pill.  This most comprehensive study to date of  pill-related deaths that occurred among  46,000 women involved in the study since  1968. Half of the women used in the study  had never taken the pill.  The study attributes the increased death rate  to circulatory diseases, including heart  attacks and other heart ailments, high blood  pressure, blood clots, strokes and brain  hemorrhages. The new findings also suggest  that the risk of death associated with the pill  may increase with the length of time a  woman takes the pill and that this risk may  remain elevated for some years after pill use  is discontinued. Combined with cigarette  smoking, the dangers of pill use were said to  escalate further.  The study has prompted British medical  authorities to recommend that women over  35 stop using the pill.  WOMEN STEELWORKERS SUE  BETHLEHEM STEEL OVER DISCRIMINATORY MATERNITY LEAVE POLICIES  Chicago (LNS) - The United Steelworkers  of America (USW) local at Bethlehem Steel's  Burns Harbor, Indiana plant filed a massive  class action suit in federal court on October  10 against that company's discriminatory  maternity leave policies. The suit, which  was filed in behalf of the plant's 500 women  steelworkers, asks for back pay compensation and in addition punitive damages of  $20 million.  "Whenever they found out you were  pregnant, say around two or three months,  you were out the door," said Diane  Gumualski, chairperson of the local's  Insurance and Worker's Compensation  Committee and co-chairperson of the  district's Women's Caucus. "Not only that,  they'd cut off your Blue Cross benefits too."  The Indiana Employment Security Division  is also named in the suit because it refused  to pay unemployment compensation to the  women who were forced to take maternity  leaves during the early months of their  pregnancies.  "Since most women are able to work until at  least the seventh month of their pregnancy,  it is obvious that any policy that would  force them on leave early in their pregnancy  would result in several months lost income,"  said Diane Gumualski. "With the cost of  living being what it is, we all know what the  loss of income can mean to the typical  working class family."  Union spokespeople said that Bethlehem  Steel's policy not only meant lost income,  but forced several women to terminate their  pregnancies rather than suffer the financial  loss from early maternity leave.  KELLY GIRL PROMOTES DOLLS  "Kelly Girl" is a doll. One foot tall,, it has  this name stitched on its green pinafore.  About 35,000 dolls have been distributed by  Kelly Girl, an office overload employment  agency, as part of their recent promotion in  Canada and the U.S.  INT€RNATIONAL N€WS  Secretaries and women's groups have let  Kelly Services, in Southfield, Michigan,  know what they think of this as. inine  gimmick. One company spokesperson  defended the doll, explaining that it was "of  the innocent, rag-doll variety, not sophisticated or curvaceous."  PRISON PROFITS  U.S. — "Financially the Corporation had an  excellent year. Sales were at an all-time high  of $78.1 million, retained earnings exceeded  $6 million, large inventories were reduced  and by the end of the year, a favorable cash  balance of $10.7 million was available." —  1976 Annual Report of Prison Industries,  Inc. While sales rose to $78 million, the  Corporation paid only $5.4 million in  inmate wages.  PRIZES TO THE PETTIEST  New York (LNS)-Protesting humiliation  and lack of respect on the job, Cleveland  Women Working recently ran a contest to  pick the "pettiest office procedure". The  women office workers' organization awarded  first prize to the law firm Kelley, McCann  and Livingstone, where a senior partner requires a secretary to keep on hand a fresh  supply of carrots.  Second prize went to Universal Film  Exchanges, whose women secretaries are not  trusted around the telephones. To make  sure they won't be used for personal calls,  desk phones in that office have no dials.  Another secretary complained about having  to "count and roll the coins from the boss'  child's piggy bank." Another woman protested her job assignment of buying presents  for her boss' mistress.  RAPE WITHIN MARRIAGE  BECOMES ILLEGAL IN OREGON  In Oregon it will now be against the law for  husbands to rape their wives. Senate Bill  503 enables women to bring charges against  their spouses for forced sexual intercourse.  Women who have been raped by their husbands can now prosecute in criminal court.  Oregon is the first U.S. state to make this  law. South Australia became the first  in the world to pass such a law earlier in  the year. In Canada, it is still legal for  husbands to rape their wives. (Info from  Women's Press)  SETBACK FOR SWISS  ABORTION RIGHTS STRUGGLE  Swiss voters narrowly defeated restrictions  on abortion in the first twelve weeks of  pregnancy September 25.  Right-wing forces, led by the Christian  Democrats and the Church, organized a  powerful campaign against women's right to  abortion. Caritas, a 'charitable' organization  backed by the Catholic Church, blanketed  Switzerland with a pamphlet opposing the  12-week limit. Priests read diatribes against  abortion from the pulpits and the Pope  called for a NO vote along with most Protestant church leaders. The women's move-  . ment and the left campaigned vigorously for  a YES vote in the referendum.  FIRST RAPE PROTEST IN SPAIN  About 20,000 persons demonstrated  September 15 in Sabadell, Catalonia in  response to the murder of Antonia  Hernandez% a young female worker, after an  attempted rape. The demonstration, the  first of its kind in Spain, drew members of  the community, the trade unions, and all the  major political organizations. Most businesses closed their doors in response to the  action. Demonstrators gathered in front of  the Town Hall, where a delegation was  received by the mayor. The delegation  pressed for safety measures, in particular for  an all-night bus service. Two days later, in  Barcelona, the women's movement assembled 1,000 demonstrators in response to the  incident. (Socialist Voice)  DEMONSTRATION OF OUTRAGE'  HITS RAPISTS AT OHIO STATE  Columbus, Ohio — Over 400 people joined  in a "demonstration of outrage" at the  Ohio State University (OSU) campus here  Oct. 24 to protest intimidation and violence  against women.  The rally was called in reaction to the rape  and beating of an OSU student by three  men, who attacked the woman because they  believed her to be a lesbian.  The woman, who prefers her name not be  given, said that she had been repeatedly  harassed thtoughout the fall and as she ate in  a student dining room Oct. 6 she was  threatened by three men.  "We don't want a dyke in our commons,"  they said. "You better move out. If you  don't, we will show you what men are like."  Less than one week later, on Oct. 12, the  'woman was attacked as she walked across  campus by the same three men.  (Info from The Guardian) page*  FULL AND IMMEDIATE  COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY  Simple logic suggests that a partnership  based on equal sharing and responsibility is  a far sounder foundation on which to base a  marriage than one which keeps one spouse in  a dependent and subordinate position.  BILL 69 AGAIN - IT'S IMPORTANT!  Bill 69 is a dangerous farce. It claims to  make marriage partners equal. Then it denies  that equality at the essential time it is  needed — during the marriage.  Feminists have only a little over a month  left. If we cannot persuade the provincial  government that their suggested amendments to the Family Relations Act are  inconsistent with their stated goals, women  within marriage will be in an even worse  situation than they are today.  The first amendments define marital property. They outline the procedures for identifying and dividing that property at the  dissolution of the marriage, or at judicial  separation. The proposed legislation stipulates that "family assets" (that property  which is used within the family) are deemed  to be shared equally. But, it specifically  exempts business assets in the name of one  spouse.  FALSE EQUALITY  In doing this, the proposed amendments fail  to recognize the dollar value of housework.  Or child-raising. Or to recognize that educational or career experiences acquired by the  working spouse are assets which should be  shared upon dissolution of the marriage.  By creating a deferred sharing scheme, they  have denied the concept of marriage as an  equal partnership where both partners have  equal power, equal recognition.  They have denied this concept in spite of a  recent study which showed 96% of people  agreed or strongly agreed that all assets  acquired during a marriage should be divided  equally if the marriage breaks down. The  Royal Commission on Family and Children's  Law also recommended full community of  property as the only system to recognize  equality within marriage.  Having denied the basic premise of equality  and having denied access to the courts for a  property settlement until divorce or judicial  separation (a process that could take up to  five years), Bill 69 does set up some good  procedures:  1. Upon application to the B.C. Supreme  Court, a spouse can get an order prohibiting  sale, etc. of family assets until a court makes  a decision as to who is to get what.  2. The Court will have the authority to declare ownership or rights of possession; to  divide all family assets into shares so that  everything will not have to be sold in order  to divide it up. The Court will have discretion to alter the 50-50 split in family assets  and to include property other than family  assets in the settlement when circumstances  warrant. The guidelines include: length of  marriage,  the  properties brought  into the  i marriage by either spouse, and the effects  of the responsibilities adopted by the  spouses on their individual earning  capacities.  SURVEY SHO WS OVER WHELMING  S UPPOR TFOR COMM UNITY PR OPER TY  A recent study conducted by Dr. Daniel  Koenig, University of Victoria, shows that  96% of the population surveyed supports the  concept of full and immediate Community  of Property.  This discretion has been granted to prevent  inequities which could arise because of the  definition of family assets. Definitions do  vary. In Manitoba, for example, family  assets means those assets acquired in anticipation of marriage or during it, for family  purposes. The B.C. definition includes all  assets used primarily for the family. This,  according to the explicators of the legislation, creates inequities.  "When there is a vast amount of property  accumulated principally through the contributions of one spouse in a marriage that  survives for only a short period of time,  the Court will adjust the property division  accordingly." All they appear to have done  is include in the legislation those guidelines  or precedents already established by court  decisions — and for the most part, these have  not been favourable to women.  during  Marriage:  Who gets to take ojf  with  theGOODIGS?  ONUS ON FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT  SPOUSE  However, once we get to the question of  maintenance and support, the tables are  turned. Now we are to be treated as equals.  The proposed amendment to the maintenance provision puts the onus of self-support  upon a financially dependent spouse. It  assumes that women's incomes are financially equal to men's! It cannot give sufficient importance to the economic reality that  a woman's earning power is generally less  than a man's and that a woman who has  been out of the job market while raising  children will never catch up to her husband.  The proposed legislation provides for mar-  raige contracts to be enforceable as property  sharing and management contracts. The  Court will uphold the agreement unless it is  proven that the contract was entered into  fraudulently, or under duress, or undue  influence, or when its terms are grossly  unfair. Needless to say, one can contract  out of any property rights for either spouse,  or contract a variety of community and  management of property arrangements.  There is no requirement that persons entering marriage be made aware of the  possibilities.  Bill 69 is especially sneaky in that it looks as  if it's modelling itself after the Berger  proposals. It isn't. It uses some of the  Berger language and that's all.  WRITE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  AND DEMAND THAT THE FOLLOWING  CONCEPTS BE MADE LAW:  1) the concept that marriage is an economic  partnership of equals.  2) the concept that the family is the fundamental group unit in the economy.  3) the recognition of unpaid work within the  family is as vital to this family unit and to  society as paid work outside the family.  4) the right of the partners during the  marriage to an equal, ongoing share of both  present and future security.  5) the responsibility of marriage partners  to support each other with services and/or  finances to reflect the concept of marriage  as an interdependent partnership of shared  responsibility.  6) during the marriage, the right to participate jointly in all economic decisions.  7) the right of the marriage partners, if dissolution should occur, to an equal share of the  assets accumulated during the marriage.

Women there are  unhappy with their living conditions. They  may be isolated in their town but they are  not alone in their dissatisfaction.  More than 100 women discovered, when  they met recently at the first provincial  conference on women and economic development in resource and one-industry  that problems they thought peculiar to their  own rural communities were common  throughout B.C.'s isolated towns.  Last year Diana Ellis, Secretary of State's  Pacific regional consultant on women's  issues, travelled to Northern B.C. and encouraged three women to form a task force  to research and report on their single  industry resource communities: Kitimat,  Fraser Lake and Mackenzie.  The report was presented at the conference  by authors Gina Baker, Joan Kotarski and  Ellie Burton. Baker reports, "the problems  from a woman's viewpoint are many in a  single resource town.  "During the day she may feel there are few  places to go and few things to do to occupy  her time or challenge her abilities. Shopping  facilities are limited and she may do most of  it 100 miles away, or by mail order  catalogue. There are no organized centres  for her preschool children and she will probably rarely get a break from their constant  responsibility. There is little chance of her  finding employment as all jobs have long  waiting lists.  "The winters are long and there are few  places of entertainment; for example, there  are no movies. If her husband is on shift  work she may find she misses most of the  dances and social gatherings, her friends may  not call for fear of waking her husband, and  she may find herself taking her children for  drives or walks with no places to go, so her  husband can sleep uninterrupted in the  afternoon.  "She may find it difficult to make friends  and she may become withdrawn and  depressed. Alcoholism may become a  problem, and her family relationships break  down."  Reports of deprivation and isolation predominated the workshops. Women spoke of  lonliness, frustration, depression and alcoholism as the most common ailments among  women and men.  Extensive studies of rural life in New  Zealand and North America, researched by  Dr. Stephen Webb, a sociology professor at  the University of Victoria and Dr. John  Colette of the University of Utah, Salt Lake  Joyce Hamilton,  Burns Lake, at mike.  City, confirmed the women's complaints.  They revealed that pastoral tranquility is  nothing more than rustic fantasy. The  researchers found that the usage of prescribed mood-modifying drugs such as  tranquilizers, hypnotics, antacids, antipsychotics and antidepressants was twice as  high in rural areas as in high population  areas.  They concluded that the more rural the  area, the more stress-related disorders. The  denser the population, the less the stress.  Studies also showed that physical health is  much poorer in rural areas. Unemployment  and poverty are more widespread. The  suicide rate is higher.  The rural dweller's "relative deprivation may  engender feelings of frustration, alienation  and isolation," Webb was quoted as saying.  B.C.'s rural women do not expect miracles  but they are desperate for changes. As one  Ocean Falls resident put it, "I've got to get  out. If things don't change soon, I've got to  leave."  Part of the responsibility, they admit is  theirs. Women have not marched down the  streets of the rural towns demanding an  equal voice in the planning and developing  of their communities.  They have not sat on the advisory planning  committees, they rarely run for council, and  many have even lost the initiative to leave  their sheltered home lives.  The reason, they say, is partly due to  inadequate facilities such as daycare and  transportation services which render them  immobile, especially during the severe winter  months. Another is the fear of being ostracized. Conference delegates said they are  afraid to "make waves" because their  neighbours would quickly reject and  abandon them. Total isolation would be  unbearable, they said.  The task force called for provincial and  federal governments "to establish indepen-  L-R: Dianne Quinn, Kitimat; Jane Brasser, Elaine Yorston, Norma Carey, all of Prince George  Discussion of resolutions  dent regional task forces of lay women and  men to assist in setting out guidelines and  criteria for further economic development  plans.  It stressed the need for permanent funding  for women's centres in these small towns.  Finding that child care services were meagre  at best, the team's report demanded that at  least adequate facilities and staff be provided  for mothers, that a rural town's social structure be extended to include entertainment  for women, most of whom agreed they were  not welcome in bars without their husbands.  Housing in some regions lacked play areas  for children who were forced to play in  apartment halls when the weather was bad.  Many families live in company trailer courts  which "have very small lots; bad road conditions inside the courts, and poor play areas  for children, making the trailer dwellers feel  like second-class citizens.  "Many non-basement houses have been built  and in winter, as snow from the street is  blown in and piled higher than the roof, the  atmosphere becomes claustrophobic. Many  women in these situations become  depression cases," reports Burton from  Kitimat.  Jobs for women are scarce. Burton says that  women was hired mainly in part time jobs,  "the company doesn't have to, and doesn't,  provide any of the benefits that it does for  its full-time workers. Part-time workers  don't have any medical plan, or sick leave, or  life insurance, no long-term sick plan, no  paid holidays and no accumulated time off.  'ñ†"Although Alcan is to be credited for beginning to hire women into its hourly paid  work force in 1974, the participation of  women is still at a token level. At present,  61 of our 2,000 hourly paid workers are  women."  The B.C. branch of the Community Planning  Association of Canada has looked into economic development and planning of rural  communities. Dr. Raymond Rodgers, in a  brief submitted to the provincial government  earlier this year, indicated that with government and corporate back up, more emphasis  on people productivity and less on profit,  communities could do more to provide jobs  for its residents.  He also suggested that unemployed planning  graduates (of which there are many, he says)  should be prompted to share their expertise  and experience with rural residents who  "cannot afford professional help and find  the planning services of the provincial government unable to respond because of time,  distance, staffing and funds."  The women's task force has been extended  to include representatives from all over B.C.  (Joey Thompson wrote this article for The  Province [19/11/17]. Joey is an Executive  Member of VSW.) KINESIS    page 10  KINESIS   page 11  NORTHGRN WOMGNS TASK FORCG  WOMGN AND GCONOMIC DGVGLOPMGNT  Diana Gllis  / have been asked to try and put down on  paper some of the history of the development of the Northern Women's Task Force  on Single Industry Towns — and of the  development of the women and economic  development issue as it was discussed at the  recent conference in Prince George. Please  remember as you read this that I am not  pretending to speak as a northern woman —  but rather as a person who was fortunate  enough to work with northern women for  the past 18 months, and fortunate enough to  be allowed to play a particular role in the  process of organizing around this issue.  CONNECTING ISSUES AND PEOPLE  From all the things I have learned about  organizing in the past several years, most of  it from other women, the most important  concept that emerges for me is the concept  of connections. There are always issues to  work on, there are always people to work  with, there is always energy floating around  somewhere. The key is to CONNECT the  right issue with the right people — and the  energy resulting from that right connection  always takes care of the action. And what  makes this issue right? What makes this  connection happen? The issue must be relevant to the persons involved — emotionally,  rationally and politically.  The first perceptions that I had of the innate  common sense and relevance of women's  participation in the economic development  process was when I read a speech made by  Eileen Caner, Director of the Women's  Economic Rights Branch of the Ministry of  Economic Development. She was speaking  to a conference of women in Terrace, and in  outlining the reasons why women had not  been included in the economic decisionmaking structure, and what difference it  would make if they were involved, she said:  ...if [economic development] terms of reference are drawn up with the basic assumption  that women exist as dependents of men and  not as persons responsible for their own  economic future then the studies, planning  agreements or development schemes will be  such that they deliver programs that validate  and reinforce the original dependency  assumption. Economic expansion rarely  results in economic development for marginal groups unless a conscious decision to  change the position of these groups is built  right into the terms of reference.  Those words are important — and they  stuck.  THE PROBLEMS ARE THE SAME  The other words and scenes that stuck were  the ones spoken by women who lived in  some of the single industry and resource  communities I visited in northern B.C. from  May 1976 to March 1977. In Mackenzie,  Joan Kotarski and Kelly Smith talked about  the effect that their town — a relatively  youthful single industry forestry town — had  on the women and children who came there  with their husbands. They talked about the  phenomenal level of debt that the young  couples quickly accumulated, the inadequate  services available for women, children and  teens, the reluctance of women to get out of  their houses even for a weekly macrame  class, and the lack of employment opportunities for women. In the mining community  of Fraser Lake I stayed with Emily Pacholuk  and learned first hand about the reality of  .shiftwork — three- members of her family  worked at the mine at that time and each  was on a different shift and someone was  always sleeping, someone was always need  ing a meal. In Kitimat I listened to the  women's group describe the tensions that  existed in all of their lives during the 1976  Alcan strike — and how that tension still  touched them. All of these people told  stories that are too long to recount here.  You can read about them firsthand in the  Report of the Northern Women's Task  Force on Single Industry Towns (available  from Women's Research Centre, 517 East  Broadway, Vancouver, B.C.).  The point that became so clear to me was  that their stories were basically the same.  The industries may have been different, the  towns were hundreds of miles apart, but the  women were all undergoing the same experiences. I can recall so clearly sitting on a  Greyhound bus going to Burns Lake in the  summer of 1976 and wondering how we  could begin a connecting process that would  link up women in these resource communities and provide a space for them to speak to  one another. At that time I didn't have  much idea of what could come after that,  but it seemed obvious that if at least there  was a communication connection, then there  was the possibility of women realizing that  if all of them were having the same experiences, there must be some way of working  out a collective strategy, and a collective  political understanding of how and why the  system operates in this fashion.  THE TASK FORCE  One response was to try to create a structure  that would begin this connection and provide the meeting, learning and communication space for single industry town women.  So, after discussions with individual women  and groups in the towns of Kitimat, Fraser  Lake and Mackenzie (chosen because of the  active women's groups in each, as well as  their industrial base and geographic location)  we formed the Northern Women's Task.  Force on Single Industry and Resource  Communities. We utilized the small amount  of contract monies available through my job  as women's consultant to hire three organizers who would complete the following  tasks:  1. Assist and involve women living in  each community to define the needs of  the community as they related to women.  2. Develop techniques that would more  effectively identify the problems relevant  to women in single industry towns.  3. Prepare a report that would outline the  needs and outline the research techniques  developed.  Each of the women were to receive $1,000  for their work and this would include travel  monies to attend the two teaching/information sharing workshops that were to play  such an important role in tying together  the women and the issue of economic  development.    As well, we contracted the  Women's Research Centre in Vancouver to  come north and lead both workshops. This  was another important connection that was  made as we wanted to learn to research the  communities from a woman's perspective.  We didn't want yet another collection of  statistics and numbers; it was important for  women to accept and validate their own experiences in these communities, and to  present those experiences to the decision  makers and insist that these life experiences  be seen as evidence that the continuing  omission of women from the economic  development decision making process would  be to continue a cycle of depression,  isolation and illness, both for women and  for families.  THE PROCESS  With the creation of this Task Force a long  five-month process began. We dug up and  shared pounds of resource material that had  already been written on single industry  towns. Long letters were sent to one  another telling of work and research plans.  Telephone lines were busy with questions  and clarifications. The women flew, drove  and took the train to the two workshops.  The first one was held in Prince George in  January, the second in Kitimat in March.  The women's centre in each town hosted the  meetings, offering potluck dinners, billeting  and meeting spaces. Helga Jacobson and  Gene Errington of the Research Centre spent  long hours with the task force members on  their research — supporting them, offering  suggestions, clarifying over and over again  that the most important thing the women  could do would be to document, in their  own words, what it was like to live in these  towns — that no one had asked for or heard  this material before and that the stories had  to be told.  By the end of our second workshop in  March the task force members were ready to  begin writing their final report, and were  also wanting to begin planning some kind of  action that would take these reports beyond  their own towns. Everyone was feeling so  good  about  their  work,  and  about  other  women's response to their work that we decided to start thinking about a way to reach  out to women in single industry towns all  over B.C.  CONFERENCE PLANNED  Eventually we decided to use a conference  on women and economic development as the  vehicle for action and in the summer of  1977 a steering committee for such a conference was formed. The committee consisted  of women from the task force, as well as  women from Prince George, Dawson Creek  and Quesnel. The steering committee again  took to the air and to the roads and met  twice this summer and fall, and in two full  meeting days, planned the agenda, the  structure, the speakers, accommodation,  funding, child care, food — all those things  that needed to be looked after. Our budget  was $12,000 and in a mood of assurance we  booked the Inn of the North for November  11-13, and designed and mailed out flyers  to women in over 40 single industry and  resource   towns   in   B.C.   and   the  Yukon.  RESPONSE TREMENDOUS  The response was tremendous — we could  have had 300 women at the conference if  we had had enough money. Once again it  proved to us that this issue was real to  women. It spoke to their needs and offered  a way for them to begin to see themselves  operating in a new way within their towns.  We applied for monies from both the Secretary of State and the provincial Ministry of  Economic Development. The federal monies  came through, but the province due to  "economic restraints" chose not to involve  themselves in this conference. We scrambled around for the rest of our money and  finally received enough extra money from  the women's program office of Secretary of  State in Ottawa. The women there understood the importance of this issue from the  very beginning, and were excited about its  development as a national women's issue  that would have relevance to women in  similar   communities   across   the   country.

In 18 months we all  made enough connections to bring together  103 women from B.C. and the Yukon (representatives came from Alberta and Ontario  as well) and together we went through the  tremendous consciousness-raising experience  of participating in a 2V£-day conference that  spoke to the needs of women in single  industry and resource communities. At the  conference we shared even more resource  town horror stories, listened to women talk  of their experiences in the non-traditional  work force, sat through workshops on child  care, lobbying, town planning, employment,  community research and the political/economic analysis of single industry towns. W£  passed resolutions in all these areas and as  well, struck a working committee to begin  expanding the task force to include women  from all over B.C. and the Yukon.  The issue is real — it makes great political  sense as well as emotional and rational sense.  The experiences of the women living in these  towns are real. The connection worked, a  process has begun and the work will  continue. Whoever said the women's movement was dead was out to lunch!  TASK FORCG RGPORT  NORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA  WOMEN'S TASK FORCE REPORT ON  SINGLE INDUSTRY RESOURCE  COMMUNITIES  The following excerpts are taken from the  above report. Reports were prepared on  three single industry resource communities:  Kitimat, Fraser Lake, and Mackenzie.  INTRODUCTION  The attached reports of the Northern British  Columbia Women's Task Force on Single  Industry Resource Communities are written  by women who speak to their own concerns  and needs as inhabitants of single industry  towns. We have read the documentation of  the problems of single industry towns, but,  more important, we have experienced them.  We are convinced that if there is to be any  positive change for women in presently  existing single industry communities, and if  there is to be any positive developments for  women in future communities we must voice  our own perceptions of what life is like for  us and demand full participation in the planning,   governing   and   evaluating   processes.  Excerpts from the Kitimat Report, prepared  by the Tamitik Status of Women:  The Kitimat Townsite Report (1951-1952)  is a 270 page study which was meant to be  the guide to development of the town of  Kitimat, British Columbia. The following  quote is the opening paragraph in the  planning objectives written by Clarence  Stein:  of Kitimat is the industrial  plant. That success will  degree that workers are conlike living in Kitimat. Unless  attract and hold industrial  will be continuing turnover  "The  purpose  success   of  the  depend on the  tent, that they  the  town  can  workers, there  and difficulty, interfering with dependable  output."  This paragraph is important in that it holds  information which explains, in part, who life  for many women in Kitimat is the way it is  today.  The first sentence outlines the value hierarchy that the town was built on. The top  priority of the town is the success of Alcan.  The contentment of the workers is important, but only in so far as it affects the success of the plant. Women, who even today  don't significantly count as "workers", are  not mentioned at all.  In 1973, the turnover rate at Alcan skyrocketed to 62 per cent. Although it is difficult  to see that this has had much of a negative  effect on the "dependable output", as  Alcan's profits after taxes in 1976 were  fifty-one million dollars, and for the first  quarter of 1977 were thirty-five point five  million dollars, an Employee Turnover  Report was done to look into the matter.  continued on p.12 page 12  KITIMAT: ALCAN PROFITS   vs.   HUMAN NEEDS  continued from page 11  The report found that there was an increase  in young, short-service single men as a  proportion of the work force, and that there  was a substantial increase in turnover of  these men. It also found that the two main  needs of these men not being met by the  community were entertainment and transportation. As a result of these findings,  Alcan stated that they were "... examining  closely the 'entertainment' problem with a  view to encouraging the development of  more recreation and social opportunities for  young, single workers. We are also continuing to actively support the municipality in  its efforts to institute a public transportation  system." Since the completion of the report  in 1974 a public transportation system has  been instituted in Kitimat, and a number of  pool halls and pubs have opened.  Unfortunately, in a town dominated by one  industry as Kitimat is, where women do not  directly affect the "dependable output" of  the industry, their needs have not been so  closely attended to.  The report covers all aspects of daily life for  Kitimat women under the headings: housing,  shopping, transportation, social situation,  health care, problems women face upon  arrival, employment, women at Alcan (an  aluminum smelter plant, a subsidiary of the  Aluminum Company of Canada), day care,  and women on welfare.  Excerpts from the HEALTH CARE section:  Many complaints by women in the north can  be attributed to the attitude they face when  trying to function in a very male-oriented  part of the country. Women arriving in Kitimat face a very stressful period in trying to  adapt to this environment. Many feel they  never quite make the transition. When such  basic needs as employment, shelter, social  and medical needs are not met, women lose  their sense of self-worth and feel oppressed.  WINTER  DEPRESSION  Over the long winter months severe depression often manifests itself. Doctors admit to  a very hig incidence of depression among  young married women but beyond prescribing mood-elevating drugs and tranquilizers,  they feel there is little more than can do.  Women themselves complain the doctors  have little time to spend with them. Many  women will come to the doctor showing all  the signs of depression but complaining of  some medical ailment. Doctors try to treat  the complaints, often failing to deal with the  psychological and social problems because  of a lack of support systems. A number of  women each year are brought into hospital  after having taken an overdose of their  prescription drugs in a desperate attempt to  have someone recognize their problems and  help them deal with their situations.  A young woman recently discharged from  hospital after an overdose relates, "I did not  want to die! I wanted to live but I needed  help desperately. My mental health was  deeply affecting my family. The drugs the  doctor gave me enabled me to function, but  I came to depend on them. Nothing changed. My anxieties remained. After months  of existing in this drugged stupor I chose the  only alternative I could see."  Another woman states she was so anxious  she couldn't leave her house for days on end.  "I would phone the doctor's office explaining I needed to see someone but could not  come to the office. The nurse would then  suggest I come down when I felt better.  When I finally managed, the doctor gave me  a prescription for tranquilizers. Once home'  with them, I took all the tablets. I really  felt that's what everyone wanted me to do."  A young mother with small children has  been admitted to hospital a number of times  in a severely depressed state. "It's always  the same experience. I'm fed a great number  of pills and feel 'heady' the length of my  hospitalization. I'm discharged when I tell  them I'm feeling better and want to return  to my family, who also have to be admitted  to the children's ward during my stay in  hospital, for lack of alternative homecare."  While we are aware of the problems that  exist in finding qualified specialists to practise in isolated northern towns, we feel  strongly that a greater emphasis on preventive medicine and mental health should be  stressed in these areas.  Charlotte Croquet, ex-mill worker  and ex-shop steward, Prince George  In the original Kitimat Townsite Report,  neighbourhood health centres were planned  for. These were to be located in each of the  neighbourhood centres, ensuring easy accessibility for the local residents. Programs on  general health education and mental and  physical well-being were to be implemented  in these centres by trained staff.  Excerpts from PROBLEMS WOMEN FACE  UPON ARRIVAL:  Most often, a woman comes to Kitimat  because her husband has found, or hopes to  find, work. Being in a new and very remote  area, she is most often hudreds or thousands  of miles apart from family and friends. It  is not easy to meet people and establish new  friendships and once friendships are made,  they are frequently not long-lasting due to  the high turnover rate of the population.  This lack of a support system contributes to  the development of a number of problems.  Childrearing becomes more difficult and  an additional burden is placed on the  husband-wife relationship as they must now  look to each other to fulfill the needs that  were once met by family and friends.  CONCLUSION  According to Dr. J. Lajzerowicz, of the  Federal Department of Energy, Mines and  Resources, "... one-industry or resource-  based towns are a significant component of  Canada's urban structure accounting for in  excess of 2 million inhabitants in all  locations in 1972." And in a discussion  of planned single-enterprise communities in  a recent paper entitled, Planning New Communities in Canada by Norman E.P.  Pressmen, Kitimat is singled out as, "... one  of the country's more successful ventures ...  It is considered as one of the most significant of North American contemporary contributions to planning principles and  practice ..."  If single-industry communities form such a  significant percentage of the entire Canadian  population, and if, out of over 800 communities Kitimat is singled out as an example of  "one of the country's more successful  ventures," then the time to re-examine this  kind of rhetoric, and the thinking it reveals,  is long overdue.  The situation we find is that over 800 communities throughout Canada were created  by privately owned companies, for the  express purpose of exploiting, for private  purposes, the resources found in these areas.  This has been the main raison d'etre for  these towns. Also, these one-industry or  resource-based operations (eg. mining, pulp  and paper, aluminum) offer employment in  areas that have been traditionally, and-  ' continue to be, occupied by men. As a  result of these factors, we find these communities are operating without any substantial consideration for the welfare of the  women who live there.  JOBS, SERVICES,  SCARCG  The life experience of the women of Kitimat  one of the "more successful" of these  company towns, has been described here. It  has been seen that these women are most  often wives who are kept indoors (with their  children, if preschool age) due to the inclement weather, and the lack of support  services for a major portion of the year;  and it is known that there is a high incidence  of mental illness for unemployed wives.  Yet employment opportunities are scarce  and even when a job is found it rarely offers  enough money to live on. The lack of usable  day care again handicaps women in their  efforts to become employed. When family  breakups occur, women are more often than  men the heads of single-parent families; and  more women end up on welfare than men.  These profound problems continue to exist,  while Alcan lends it energies to encouraging  the opening of pool halls and pubs in an  effort to lower their turnover rate. When a  group of women requested $100 per month  from Alcan to help them open a child-  minding centre (they had, on their own  initiative, already received a small grant from  the government to help finance this centre),  Alcan replied that they felt they should not  be involved with this sort of service, and that  it should be "self-contained".  Clearly, when a town can be called "successful" in the name of monetary profit, and  private profit at that, the priorities are  wrong. BOOKS  page 13  DIVORCE CHILDREN WELFARE: An  Up-To-Date Handbook on Canadian Family  Law, by Penelope John. Published by  Anansi Press.  Reviewed by Alison Campbell  I find the sub-title of this book misleading.  The book was written in, and is probably  accurate for, Ontario, but it is confusing  and in some places definitely not applicable  to British Columbia. Family Law is largely  a provincial rather than a federal jurisdiction  — therefore, to be accurately informed you  would need books written for each province.  If you are unaware of how poorly the justice  system handles family problems presently,  read this book and campaign for change. If  you think you can settle problems out of  court, DO! If you are thinking of leaving a  bad situation, this book could scare you into  staying.  When will someone be able to write a positive book to help families in trouble? Not  until the legal system is no longer upholding  traditional stereotyped roles and all persons  have equal rights that can be enforced.  SELF-ASSERTION FOR WOMEN: A  GUIDE TO BECOMING ANDROGYNOUS,  by Pamela Butler. Published by Canfield  Press, San Francisco, 1977. $8.95.  Reviewed by Jane Evans  A clinical psychologist, Dr. Butler has conducted workshops in assertiveness training  for women. Her book suggests that an  androgynous woman is a woman of power —  while not aggressive, she has, nevertheless,  the power to control her environment. She  has only to state her aims logically and"  reasonably for all to go as she wishes.  This is not, however androgyny as suggested  by Phyllis Chesler in Women and Madness.  Rather, this is a social melding of attitudes  — andro-man-social assertiveness, gyno-  woman-social submissiveness — which have,  until now, been attributed to each sex. Dr.  Butler also minimizes the antogonism and  tenacity of those who have a vested interest  in the submissiveness of women.  All the same, this is a useful book in that it  lays out clearly the choices in an interaction;  one can see oneself in her examples of  positive and negative interaction. Butler  writes in an extremely un-angry, supportive  way and her style is clear and pleasant to  read.  WOMEN AT HOME, by Arlene Rossen  Cardozo. Published by Doubleday, New-  York, 1976. $7.95.  Reviewed by Adrienne Montani  I cannot begin to express the rage I felt in  reading this book. Ms. Cardozo uses dishonest ploy and elitest rationalization to  re-state the age-old cliche of women's  historical oppression in the family — "a  woman's place is in the home". While  veiling her intent in talk of "individual  freedom" and "personal fulfillment and  development", she slanders working mothers  for pursuing the "success ethic" or as suffering from "superwoman syndrome" and urges  total sacrifice to the "security" of children  and family.  In the author's view, any mother who asserts  her own desires or talents outside the home  is guilty of neglect and selfishness; if she asks  or demands help from her husband in house  hold management, she is being unfair. Any  hint of competitiveness or career orientation  is condemned and held up to scorn. Rather,  women with children should "develop their  creative potential" in artistic hobbies and  crafts, as long as these interests never interfere with family demands.  Her naivete is most apparent when she professes that what she describes is a single  alternative lifestyle, while loading other  alternatives with heavy guilt trips and false  representation of their actual practice. Even  within the very narrow parameters she sets  for "acceptable" activity, the women in her  "success" stories repeatedly talk of willingly,  happily, postponing their education and  interests until after their children are raised,  in order to have the "freedom" td serve their  families. Thus, what Cardozo has done is  reinforce the limited role that women with  families have traditionally played, using  deceptive terms like "freedom" and "liberation" to put the onus of failure on women  if they don't enjoy it!  I do not dispute the author's starting point  that establishing and maintaining a close  relationship with children is important. I  do resent her assertion that only the mother  who stays at home can fully achieve this  closeness, and that homemaking is strictly a  woman's duty.  DIANA PRESS VANDALIZED  Diana Press has sent the following letter to  women's publications and presses in an  appeal for help following a recent attack  on their workplace:  You have probably heard about the act of  vandalism against Diana Press Tuesday  morning October 25. We have been placed  in precarious financial condition and we're  fighting to stay alive. Five thousand copies  of Rita Mae Brown's A Plain Brown Wrapper  were destroyed creating severe immediate  cash flow problems. Paint, ink, chemicals  and Comet cleanser were poured into our  machines, including presses and typesetting  composers, making it impossible for us to do  commercial work to get some money. The  typesetting and paste-up of at least three of  our fall books were destroyed holding up the  printing of our fall line. Other than  donations, the only way we have to raise  money is to quickly sell our remaining  inventory. We are preparing a brochure now  advertising the books which were not  damaged.

THE WHEEL OF THINGS, A BIOGRAPHY  OF L.M. MONTGOMERY, by Mollie Gillen.  Published by Fitzhenry & Whiteside Ltd.,  Don Mills, Ontario, 1975.  Reviewed by Chris Preiswerck  I approach each new biography I read with a  special thrill because I feel that individual  lives are the most enjoyable and thorough  way to understand history. What else is  herstory, after all, but the sum of the lives  and actions of all, interacting to create social  political and economic forces which in turn  profoundly influence the thoughts and  actions of each. A good biography, therefore, has to describe an individual life as a  segment of history, both acting upon others  and reacting to the actions of others, to  create social forces typical of that era.  I began the biography of L.M. Montgomery  with interest because her books had occupied a special place in my childhood. As a  confirmed 'tomboy', her books were some  of the few 'girl's stories' I not only read but  enjoyed and could emphathize with. It was  disappointing, therefore, to be unable to  empathize with Lucy Maud Montgomery as  she is depicted in this biography.  Basically, the story is interesting and well-  written. I enjoyed hearing more about this  cherished childhood author and her life, but  the book seemed to skim the surface. I was  never brought face to face with the woman  herself. There is too much narrative and  not enough analysis.  What analysis there is seems shallow. For  example, Lucy Maud expresses sorrow that  she had never been able to write a "great  book", and the author seems to agree with  this estimate of her writing. I would question this. Of course Lucy Maud was not  satisfied with her efforts. Few artists manage to create something that satisfies them,  but the biographer should be able to judge  better. Surely the creation of a character  like Anne of Green Gables, who has near-  universal appeal to children and adults in  many cultures, and is also standing the test  of time, shows a type of greatness.  Feminist analysis is especially lacking in the  book. There are a few tantalizing glimpses  of Lucy Maud's reactions to issues like  women's suffrage, and mentions her meetings with women like Nellie McClung and  Emmeline Pankhurst, but there are no  details that allow us to understand her better  and understand how these issues affected  women in her day. Lucy Maud was a  woman who was involved in the literary and  business worlds, who successfully conducted  a nine-year lawsuit against her first publisher  when she felt they were cheating her. Yet  we learn little of whether she considered  feminist questions important, and what conclusions she reached.  Before reading this book, I was not aware of  the wide intellectual interests pursued by  Lucy Maud Montgomery. Quotes from  letters reveal some of her intricate personality and leave me longing to know more. She  was a fantastic woman with great depth. In  1927 she was reading about atomic theory.  She was a minister's wife who believed that  "the day of the church is done" yet could  devote much of her time to church activities.  Was this perhaps why she could not delve  deeper into feminism, for fear of upsetting  the delicate balance of all the unwieldy and  contradictory areas of her life?  This biography is interesting but not memorable. Its subject deserves more, as she was  both interesting and memorable. WAR Demo Reactions -  page 14  ACTION EXCELLENT  The Women Against Rape Action in Vancouver on November 5, 1977 was discussed  and evaluate by our group during our regular  meeting. The general feeling was that the  action was excellent both in content and in  dramatic presentation. We appreciate the •  amount of work which went into the planning of such a well-organized demonstration.  It seemed to us that the majority of those  people watching the presentation were in  some way connected with the Women's  Movement already and therefore were conscious of the issues. The fact that throughout  the action it was pouring with rain probably  didn't encourage casual passers-by to stop  and give their full attention to what was  happening. It was also pointed out that Saturday might not have been the ideal choice  as the day for action, since there is a time lag  between the action and the day it reaches  the press on Monday.  As far as the "women only" media policy,  our group was divided. Some of us supported the request that only women be allowed  to give media coverage; others of us felt that  since women are still not as common on  camera crews, etc. as men, that the policy  restricted the amount of coverage given the  event. It also gave the male media a chance  to focus on the restrictive policy rather than  on the action itself, as shown by the picture  and article in the "Sun" November 7.  Since most people use TV and the press to  follow current events, it seems that the  opportunity for the general public to learn  about the work of WAR was limited by the  "women only" media policy.  The above criticism apart, the Collective  continues to support WAR in their efforts  to bring the crime of rape before the public  for what it truly is — not a sexual act, but an  act of violence and domination against  women.  Vancouver Women's Health Collective  POLITICALLY NAIVE  My first reaction was that the WAR media  policy was bound to fail and distract. I  attended the International Tribunal on  Crimes Against Women last year in Brussels.  The male press was banned for the same  reasons. And the same thing happened.  The male press came anyway, made  nuisances of themselves, distracted the  whole conference, and took up precious  time while we debated what to do with  them. Much of our aggression after hearing  women's horrible stories of torture, clitorec-  tomies, forced sterilization, rape, beatings  — the gamut — focused on 'getting rid of the  male press'. The result was a loss of precious  time and the media coverage of the event  focusing more on the 'hostility of the  women against them' than the subjects discussed. Either way we lost!  I was unable to attend the WAR tribunal on  November 5 but from the media coverage  and reports from friends, it looks like much  the same thing happened. What I resent  most is that we give them even more power  by focusing on and fighting with them. In  public places there is no way of limiting  access. It just makes the group look naive  and laughable. It seems to me that the only  strategy is to ignore male crews and refuse  interviews with male journalists. The only-  way of keeping 'them' out is to meet in  private — which defeats the purpose of the  exercise if we are trying to educate the  public.  If left to their own devices and ignored by us  the male press usually screws itself with its  impotent hostility. I have worked in the  "straight", ie. male, press for years and have  not yet found a simple solution to dealing  with them. It will take a revolution or a gun  to each male head — not impotent threats,  and petty skirmishes. If it is really WAR  time then let's develop some real guerilla  tactics and put away the pea shooters.  We might start by inviting women journalists from the various media factories to some  kind of meeting to work together on how  they can help us and how we can help then*  I know that some of those women are pretty  isolated and confused. If known to be feminists they often lose their jobs — still — so  let's all try to figure out what can really be  done to help them and us ... so that finally  there won't be any more of 'them' left,  just US.  Sylvia Spring  \ PRETTY   FACE   ISNT   5AFE  IN  THIS    CITY  I PROTECT    YOURSELF    WITH  Stl-F DEFENSE  ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK  One step forward ... I found many of the  personal testimonies, when women spoke  about being raped, powerful and moving.  There's definitely been an advance when  more and more women have the courage to  speak out about rape: as we realize that  women are raped, not because they "did  something wrong" or "something was the  matter with them", but it happens simply  because we are women. Even a few years  ago most women were too humiliated and  ashamed to tell even their closest friends  or family that they had been raped.  Two steps back ... If my understanding is  correct that the media policy was originally  for only the feminist and 'alternate' press  to cover the WAR event, and then for only  women to cover it for the regular press,  my view is that that policy was damaging,  divisive — and in no way useful.  Who, after all, are we trying to reach when  we talk about rape? The comparatively  small number of women who read the  feminist and alternate press? Are these  women our only concern? There are thousands of women who have never heard of  these media, and who probably couldn't  care less even if they had. Yet these women  are potential rape victims, and have a right  to be armed with as much knowledge about  it as anyone else. To ignore these women is  to be elitest.  On the point of only all-female coverage for  the regular press. This follows the "all men  are bad; all women are good" syndrome. It  is a way of seeing society that is neither  honest nor truthful. Basically, our society  is divided into two groups: a small group  who has the power — and usually the  goodies — and a much larger group who  don't have the goodies, and as yet don't  realize they have the power. Men and  women make up both groups, and the first  question of all to be asked is "which group  do you speak for?" Sexism is to be fought  against every inch of the way, within that  context.  The result of the media policy was to have  stories in the regular press which mentioned  only that male reporters and photographers  weren't allowed to cover the event. Nothing  about rape at all. Again: who are we talking  to? If it's just to ourselves — sorry, it ain't  good enough.  Daphne Morrison  WE NEED TO EDUCATE, NOT IGNORE  Sisters: You cannot avoid the press. They  linger about in obscure places clutching  broken pencils and dog-eared bits of paper.  If you remain silent they say so. If you tell  them where to go they print it. If you  ignore them, hassle them, or discriminate  against them, their swollen egos are offended  and next day you're smeared across the grey  page. I am one of THEM. But I am also a  feminist. And I stand by my belief that  there IS a way to use the media as they have  so frequently misused the women's movement. Only you don't have to adopt their  often shoddy tactics.  There is no value in the women's movement  remaining catatonic. The force is strong  enough, has matured far enough, that the  more simple minds shielded by a curtain of  printed words cannot destroy the years of  hard work and gains. The movement is not  only alive, it's damn healthy, as is evidenced  by the increasing number of well-attended  conferences, meetings and gatherings of  women who don't just talk but act upon  issues previously neglected.  Meet the media half way. Shed the paranoia  the hysteria and panic. The women's movement needs to educate people, not ignore  them. When workers strike or unemployment rises the experts are consulted and  quoted. Where are women hiding? You are  the experts on many of the social issues  hitting the front page. What more natural  process than to have an effective, reliable  and articulate branch of the movement  publicly answer to issues concerning  women?  Nobody likes the media. Everybody yells  'misquote', 'bias', and 'slanted'. The  women's movement will be no different.  Prepare yourselves for battle. Prepare to  argue against the unappreciated tongue-in-  cheek humour. The press is like a mouth  wash ... people hate it, once a day.  Surely women are capable of handling the  writers who wield a rusty knife, the columnists who get their jollies from berating others  lest they themselves should be impugned,  and the other less-than-astute pen-carriers  of our society.  It's time women stopped being shortchanged  by demanding their two cents worth. The  media must be taught that the movement IS  alive, IS healthy and DOES have valid  opinions, expert opinions, on a variety of  vital issues.  Publicity — pro or con — it's all part of the  process. Media — it's a necessary evil if  feminists want to get their message across.  So confront the media, smile at the next  person you see toting a pen that ran dry and  a notebook full of indecipherable scribbles.  Give the press a chance. They could turn  out to be half human.  Joey Thompson page 15  MEDIA POLICY SEXIST  The WAR media policy was an insult to  every male reporter and technician in Vancouver who supports the women's movement.  A WAR spokeswoman said the group wanted  to exclude male members of the press  because of past treatment of the women's  movement by the media. It is true that the  media has often ridiculed, either subtly or  blatantly, the movement. But to place the  blame on male reporters, rather than on  editors and advertising business pressure is  unfair and sexist.  The group is assuming that a woman has a  better chance of-getting a fair story published or broadcast. The group is assuming that  a woman photographer is going to take a  more sympathetic picture. Hogwash.  Sexism is sexism no matter who's practising  it. And women more than men should  recognize sexism because they have been on  the receiving end for too long. To turn  around and do it back doesn't solve anything  and only succeeds- in causing bitterness.  Kathy Ford  WOMAN AGAINST RAPE EVALUATION  Following is a summary of reactions to the  November 5th Women Against Rape (WAR)  action, aired at the B.C. Federation of  Women regional meeting, Wednesday,  November 16.  Sarah Davidson, who chaired the meeting,  suggested at the beginning that the evaluation take the form of a round, and that  women speak, uninterrupted, to the following: 1) what was productive about the  action, 2) what was unproductive about the  action, and 3) the lessons learned from the  action and which can be used in organizing  subsequent actions. The evaluation session  also offered an opportunity for women to  air and hear some previously unexpressed  thoughts and feelings about the process  organizing the action took.  Of the 50 women present at the meeting,  46 spoke in the round. This summary comes  from notes taken at the meeting by Frances  Wasserlien and Diana Smith.  THE DAY ITSELF  — it was well organized and the publicity  and leafletting was good.  — appreciated the amount of work done  towards the production.  — liked input of Chilean women, postal  worker, bus driver.  — solidarity and self-discipline shown by  some women involved who disagreed with,  for example the media policy, but carried  it out anyway.  — production was tight but also allowed  flexibility, and closed well.  — most interesting demonstration since  being in Vancouver.  — seems to have developed a coherent and  strong position on rape and violence against  women.  — no action was suggested to women who  were there, no direction given.  — I never want to go to the Courthouse  again unless to blow it up.  — same people at demonstrations. WHY do  we keep having them?  — the demonstration failed, seemed to  exclude men and certain sectors of the  women's movement.  — marshals seemed militaristic, all in dark  clothes, like storm-troopers.  — WAR created a front; women came to put  themselves on the line, but it was a shaky  line.  — who are we trying to reach? ,who is the  action aimed at?  The Tribunal as a whole was described as  visually exciting, theatrically good, tremendously exciting, stunning, colourful, powerful. Many described the personal testimony  as moving, powerful, clear and simple.  PROCESS OF THE WAR COLLECTIVE  — no form for accountability in process.  — no clear structure for decision-making  agreed upon at beginning.  — first meeting was supposed to be a coalition but ended up being limited.  — the quiet middle failed.  — 'put downs' and snickering were the shits.  — dropped out of the collective because ...  [I] ...felt the need to be armed with politics  [I] didn't have.  — script writers were defensive and not open  to change (with the recognition that time  was a problem).  — small group blamed for personal stuff that  went down but everyone is responsible.  . — didn't get involved because of conflict,  didn't have emotional energy for the strain.  — collective didn't allow for criticism,  observers.  — unwilling to get into the intensity of  internal politics.  — recognition of a group with different ideologies; need to take votes and to follow  order.  — consensus doesn't work in this situation;  need another method, need to agree at  beginning and to stick to it.  — need to examine process that reduced an  initial group of 60-70 to a core group of 7.  — group needed structure.  — felt like I entered an army camp with no  way for me to have input.  — felt bad about people walking out of  meetings.  — people came saying they are innocent  which makes others take on the role of  guilty, but there are two sides.  — a lot of women let a lot of things go by  for a long time, not a responsible way to  work.  — women who worked on action should hear  criticism (from those on receiving end).  — some women became so personally invested and worked so hard ' they can't take  criticism, but they have a responsibility to  take political criticism.  — need to keep personal separate from  political, especially in criticism.  — not a collective, group process.  — two sides in the dynamic, one side takes  effective power, other side doesn't take  responsibility, people don't recognize own  part in process.  — it was hard to be accountable, no place for  speaking out.  The general feeling seemed to be that we  didn't work well together and.we need to  learn ways to do this.  ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT OF  LITERATURE AND PRESENTATION  — we were talking to ourselves.  — too much stress on analysis, drains energy  from action.  — non-exclusive issue organizing could insure  that no ideological fights happen.  — literature alienated men who are opposed  to rape.  — if trying to reach cross-section, we need to  be less threatening.  — some women objected to the idea of all  men being potential rapists.  — assumption that men are the enemy not  true.  i with analysis.  - analysis not clearly put forward.  — class analysis lacking.  — need to decide who the enemy is, who we  are fighting.  — testimony against institutions didn't seem  to connect to personal testimony in a concrete way.  — abstract condemnation of institutions  doesn't give a concrete way to change  things.  — couldn't understand a lot of it. EVEN  if we're talking to ourselves we should be  clearer.  — too complicated, not for people on the  street.  MEDIA POLICY  — it was an experiment, and what we should  say is that we tried it and it didn't work.  — the policy created a self-fulfilling policy;  we got negative coverage.  — the media took the focus rather than the  issue of rape.  more on p.16... page .16  EVALUATIONS OF WAR ACTION  more WAR reactions  B.C.F.W. cont. from p. lb  — the media policy had been passed at a  collective meeting.  — we had more control over media than ever  before.  — it was the best coverage we ever had.  — it was bad publicity for the women's  movement.  — damaging to WAR and women in general.  — offensive, disastrous.  — if [I] had relied on the media to find out  what was happening, [I] wouldn't have  known anything about it.  — no coverage better than bad coverage; we  didn't want traditional coverage.  — the experience or issue was not communicated.  — if we are going to by-pass traditional mass  media we need to replace it with our own  form of direct communication like door-to-  door, or public speaking.  — press alienated by policy. I felt I was the  enemy, (a woman working in the media)  — wrong-headed at this time.  — posters needed more content.  — the media policy protected women.  — if it was to protect women we shouldn't  do it on courthouse steps.  — liked not having cameras and backs of  cameramen in the middle of the action.  — if the media want a story they will get it  but it may not be the story we want.  — agreed with media policy.  — analysis of media correct but need a  different way to deal with them.  — need for discussion (day workshop) on  media policy.  A FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT TIME  — need to have a clear decision making  process, including votes, and stick to it.  — differences in policy doesn't have to mean  we can't do unified work.  — it's okay to disagree.  — organize around demands; the point of  organizing is to make people believe they  can make change.  — first decide who the action is aimed at;  that will decide how it should be done.  Several women were positive about having  an opportunity to evaluate the action, and  about the form it took.  DEPRIVED OF CONTACT  Just a word of thanks to the women who  decided that the WAR Tribunal in Vancouver, November 5, 1977 could only be  covered by women in the media. It may  have effectively shown that there are no  women who hold such jobs, it also effectively deprived me of any contact I would  have had with any of the action that day as  the channel I watched had no coverage and  worse, it effectively deprived thousands of  viewers of any knowledge that anything was  going on at all. Since when have we started  to cut off our noses to spite our faces?  Johanna te Boekhorst  WAR reactions  WAR had chosen to do a tribunal, but what  the tribunal was about was no easy thing to  figure out. There were large panels set up as  background to speakers in some kind of  robes. On the panels I noticed after a while  were captions: MARRIAGE, CHURCH,  JUSTICE, but the largest and most visible  part of them were covered with symbols  I could not understand. They were cryptic  and served to emphasize what soon became  the nature of the whole presentation itself  for me.- its remoteness, its distance to the  whole experience of rape.  The speeches were tedious, longwinded and  academic. They did not carry any vitality.  They did not reach. In bits and pieces they  seemed to aim at making connections between institutions and rape. They made no  mention of people — men or women. They  did not bring alive the experience of rape. I  felt talked at rather than spoken to. I felt  like at church. Or, I felt like I usually do at  one of the male left, usual political rallies. I  got next to nothing of what had attracted  me to the Women's Liberation Movement in  the first place: the surges of excitement and  strength from making the personal the political. Here, the message seemed to be the  impersonal is the political.  More than rape, the word WAR became and  still remains the rallying word for that  action. Without any strong and meaningful  sharing of statements about the experience  and meaning of rape — the personal testimonies of women who had been raped were  simply lost after close to an hour of the  non-descript, boring speeches, — the call to  war/WAR came across as a fist in the face of  not just the institutions that were  supposedly the target, but also against us  who didn't immediately make the  connection. That kind of disconnected militancy is intimidating. Those of us who have  been raped and are familiar with the statistics that tell us how few rapes are reported  know it is hard for women to speak to what  it is like to be raped, never mind wanting to  do something about it. Taking a militant  attitude is by no means enough. Within such  a barrage of calls to WAR (from posters,  buttons, T-shirts, placards, armbands,  speeches) the word rape was lost, and with it  the issue of rape itself which is what the  rally was to be about in the first place.  Rosemarie Larsen  support Kinesis  advertisers  ♦W^'J'W'W'Two new releases from the Woi  X  At the demonstration, I experienced an  audience of about two-hundred regulars,  revealing that the organizing had not reached  the many women in this town who are  vitally concerned with rape; an unenforceable media policy that set the tribunal up for  media coverage of that policy and not the  issue of rape; the tribunal itself which did  not make me think or feel anything about  rape; the cold, blank looks from women who  were part of an effort to trash and exclude  myself and others in my study and consciou-  snessraising group from the organizing;  information from a few women about the  trashings and the lack of democratic  decision-making that continued after our  group had left.  I see these failures as a direct result of the  exclusion, trashing and punishing of women  (ourselves and possibly others) who advocated a broad based coalition structure  allowing for democratic decisionmaking.  Instead we got a co-ordinating committee in  Nanaimo making the major decisions, while  a few women in Vancouver scrambled,  slammed and trashed their way to action to  meet the WAR deadline. In the end, this  kind of "organizing" ended up to be  planning something to do for friends and coworkers, rather than mobilizing women  concerned with and affected by rape.  Another issue has come up since the demonstration. An evaluation of the action was  called by the BCFW for Wednesday, Nov.  16. Our group was never told about this  meeting by any of the women who knew of  our participation from the beginning. To me  this means that the call for an evaluation was  not a sincere one as it favoured some participants and excluded others, demonstrating  an unwillingness on the part of those  involved to learn from their mistakes.  Two women from our group have written a  leaflet outlining criticisms of the political  behaviour that led to the failure of the  demonstration. Copies of this leaflet can be  obtained by calling us at 253-2550 or  253-4995, or by writing to 2621 Charles  Street, Vancouver, B.C.

SOCIAL CREDIT WOMEN'S  AUXILIARY CONVENTION  I received the following collection of quotations. They were sent through the mail to  my home. Kinesis, Rape Relief, and several  other individuals received them, too. All  were anonymous.  I feel that any person wishing to express  their opinions to me in a personalized  manner has an obligation to identify themselves to me and to explain why I was  chosen, and how my home address was  obtained.  This tactic is disruptive and irresponsible. It  creates paranoia and anger among people  who, if approached openly, could be  involved in productive discussion.  I therefore request the person(s) responsible  to identify themselves and explain their  intentions. I also request those responsible  to make themselves available for discussion  (perhaps through Kinesis or at the next  forum) both of the issues raised by their  paper and the techniques used to distribute  it.  In struggle,  Holly Devor  WHAT HAPPENED: SOURCE NOTES  ON THE INFILTRATION AND  CO-OPTATION OF THE MOVEMENT  Today, the women's liberation movement is  in the hands of a group of liberal opportunists, and therefore in the hands of the  left/liberal male establishment. These  women are scrambling frantically after the  few crumbs that men have thrown out when  we radicals began to expose the truth and  demand some changes. These are the women  who have access to the press and the money.  They are supposedly the 'leaders' of the  women's movement, but they are leading us  down the road to a few respectable reforms  and nothing else.  How did these women get their power? The  answer is two-pronged. First, they don't ask  for much and they do not really demand  what they ask for. THEY REFUSE TO  NAME MEN AS THE ENEMY  (OPPRESSOR) and talk endlessly about that  vague monster "society" as being responsible  for it all. They claim that women are brainwashed and damaged and consent to their  own oppression, and that men, poor things,  treat women badly because they have been  socialized into a 'role.'  The other main reason why these opportunists were able to take over the women's  movement was that they were able to divide  and silence and/or drive out the pro-women  radical feminists. Their biggest tactic was to  always make every discussion, every disagreement, every everything into one of  STRUCTURE as opposed to CONTENT.  Structure replaced male supremacy as the  problem, with new structures posed as' the  solution. Thus, they never attacked the  problem directly. Those who challenged  these assumptions were subject to character  assassination or attacks on their "bad personalities". Building the proper "non-  structure" structure in the movement  became the test of whether it was radical.  Thus structure became an excellent tool for  keeping certain people and ideas under  control, for keeping theni from going too far  too fast.  (Carol Hanisch, The Liberal Takeover of  Women's Liberation)  One of the basic liberal arguments we have  encountered and no doubt will again is the  insistence on "UNITY". Any time this is  brought up, we should always ask, "UNITY  WITH WHOM? WHY? FOR OR AGAINST  WHAT?" Unity against an external enemy is  ultimately necessary, but all too often  "unity" is used as a cover to avoid dealing  with internal and external enemies. When  this happens, it is the liberals who are calling  for unity with themselves, against the  troublemakers (radicals). The liberals are  happy to have a "unity" that is developed at  the expense of radicalism because it protects  their hegemony. In "unity" they seek to  isolate and drive out the dissidents, AS  THEY HAVE BEFORE.  (Brooke, Quicksand Politics: Some Liberal  Arguments in the Women's Movement)  Many organizers labour under the illusion  that they can "use an existing, already "hot"  issue to build up their own cause. I think  that this is a delusion, that in fact it does not  save time or effort, but can really set a  movement back or even destroy it. To reach  the people "where they are at" when they  are in the wrong place, is a false approach.  Rather, We should be concerned with educating them at all times to the real issues  involved. If there ARE real issues, people  will catch on soon enough.  (Shulamith Firestone)  // we don't blame the capitalist system for  everything, they think we hate men. They  can't seem to get it through their heads that  we can blame men and capitalism at the  same time. They are so concerned that we  think men are THE enemy that they can't  hear anything else we say. It amazes us that  people who are so much the targets of redbaiting can so easily turn around and "man-  hater" bait us. MAYBE THAT EXPLAINS,  AT LEAST, WHY THEY DO MOST OF IT  BEHIND OUR BACKS.  (Carol Hanisch, Hard Knocks: Working for  Women's Liberation in a Mixed Movement  Group)  A NOTE ON DISRUPTION AND  CRITICISM AFTER THE FACT:  Here was a conglomerate of women with  totally disparate attitudes, and, for once,  they were acting in concert. It would have  been impossible to get both groups to act  collectively at a demonstration (militant), or  at decorating the centre (non-political), or  drafting by-laws (administrative); for disruption, however, they were willing to join  ranks.  The members were not willing to do the  work, whether of a social or political nature.  Therefore, they had no understanding of the  issues involved, no knowledge that they were  being exploited by the disrupters.  (Ruth Simpson, From the Closets to the  Courts)  A NOTE ON MEDIA:  There was a great deal of interest in the  press. We figured out particularly how the  press would react to an action, how they  would interpret the thing, and our strategy  was planned with that in mind. There is a  mistake in that, because the position of the  bourgeoisie toward revolutionary action is  clear in the final analysis. One should not  measure one's actions against it. There is far  too much attention paid to the media, which  lies in capitalist hands.  (Bommi Bauman, Wie Alles Anfing)  WE MUST AT THIS POINT UNDERSTAND  THAT ONE NEED NOT BE AN AGENT IN  ORDER TO DO THAT WORK OF AN  AGENT. AND IF THE END RESULT IS  THE SAME, THEN THE OPPORTUNIST  AND THE AGENT MUST BE TREATED  THE SAME.  (Third World Women's Alliance)  Last year there were indications that the  Socred Women's Auxiliary might begin to  concern itself with women's issues instead of  simply meeting once a year to hash over  past times and pass a few resolutions that  would be totally ignored by the party.  Pat Jordan had given an impassioned speech  that the Socred women should become  involved in women's questions and not leave  the running to the N.D.P. But her message  seems to have fallen on deaf ears. This year  none of the resolutions considered had anything to do with what might marginally be  considered as feminism. There was a resolution on the employment of children and  one on pornography: not because the latter  is degrading to women but because it "is  damaging to public morals, particularly  those of children." They only voted to  boycott stores which sell pornography and  that could be anywhere except a Bennett  hardware store.  There was a resolution to change the name  of the Women's Auxiliary to "Social Credit  Women's Association of British Columbia"  which went down to resounding defeat.  Proponents of the change of name said that  "Women's Auxiliary" is a name which  denotes "less than the full partnership for  the women who work for Social Credit" and  that a change of name "would reflect more  properly the vitality, progressiveness and  effectiveness of the special area of work in  which the women are engaged."  Most of the women present were pioneers of  Social Credit, W.A.C. Bennett's "shock  troops", and were proud of the title and  what it signified.  So the auxiliary stays and the women are  content to raise funds and staff committee  rooms. And the Social Credit party, as a  consequence, continues to ignore women's  concerns.

BCFW LOWER MAINLAND  REGIONAL MEETING  At the BCFW Lower Mainland Regional  Meeting, popularly referred to as the WAR  meeting, we did do more than evaluate the  Women Against Rape action.  Hopefully subsequent meetings will interest  at least an equally large number of women  to attend and be involved in deciding and  organizing strategies (and anything else  relevant   to   feminists)   in   the   next  year.  MARCH 8     ABORTION ISSUE  So far we have decided to organize action  around two events — International Day of  Protest on March 8th, and the Vancouver  General Hospital General Meeting in the  spring.  The first planning meeting on November 23  was cancelled due to bad weather. It has  been re-scheduled for Wednesday, December  7 at Britannia Community Centre, 7:30pm  in Library 4.  Jackie Simpson, from Vancouver Women's  Health Collective and chairperson of the  Health Sub-Committee, agreed to gather  more information about the VGH meeting  at which members are elected to serve on the  Board that makes abortion policy. The  whole issue of abortion and how to counter  Pro-life action was discussed. It was suggested that a day-long workshop be organized to  deal with this issue.  There were several workshop proposals  which stimulated interest, and several  women agreed to work together to organize  them. The workshops include: a political  forum where women with feminist leanings  present various political ideologies; women  in the labour movement; how to function as  a group; and possibly one on lesbianism.  Anyone interested in plugging into the  action and workshop proposals can contact  either of the regional representatives for the  Lower Mainland — Sarah Davidson at  253-2537(w) or 255-0436(h), or Diana  Smith at 251-3775.  FEMINIST KARATE ASSOCIATION  Due to renewed interest and/or general  dismay at the condition of our bodies, ie.  the need to develop more skills and strength  in self-defense and fighting, the Feminist  Karate   Association   is   being   resurrected.  We plan to incorporate karate and self-  defense techniques (this can be broadened  depending on interest). Any woman interested in working out regularly or periodically with other women should contact  either Patty Clark (929-7855) or Diana  Smith (251-3775) for more information.  Previous experience is not necessary.  VANCOUVER RAPE RELIEF organizes  rape rap sessions. Meet with other women  who have been raped.

You don't need a lawyer to take  your divorce through the courts if you learn  to represent yourself. And all it takes to  represent yourself is a familiarity with the  procedures. You don't need years of law  school! Phone Carol at 736 3746 to plan the  January times. page 19  LETTERS     *  ADS  #■  KINESIS  ISSN 0317-9095  OUR READERS WRITE  Your last issue of Kinesis looked smashing.  Very uptown. Does this mean you're about  to go out of business?  Your efforts are much appreciated. I am  comforted by your existence, your political  efforts, especially in fighting the dreary,  day-to-day, niggly-piggly aspects of discrimination.  Your existence gives me hope that our  struggle for equal rights and opportunities  will eventually, if slowly, have effect. The  knowledge of other people's struggles,  conveyed through Kinesis, in addition to the  demonstrations and rallies and contacts with  Ministers, helps bring my own personal  struggles beyond the confines of my smaller  world in the larger one.  <A>  __ __\  o o s  S   S   fc  to « «  CO CQ  £ ,x   J  Kinesis is published monthly by the Vancouver  Status of Women.

We encourage  people to get their own subscriptions. However, many of the women are in the usual  low-paying jobs for women and therefore  cannot afford it.  LETTER PROTESTS  At VSW, we often receive copies of sexist  ads from members, with a suggestion that  we take some action.  The best thing to do is take that action  yourself! If you have questions about how  to combat sexist advertising, we can send  you (for 50 cents) a booklet: Sexist Ad Kit  — How To Protest Sexism In Advertising.  It's very clear and gives you step-by-step  suggestions.  Remember — a letter to them is much more  useful than a letter to us!  McGEER DEFENDS SEXIST TEXTS  "With regard to the essay 'Nuclear Bomb  Shelter' in the Grade VIII English book,  Incentives, my Curriculum Development  Branch informs me that they have recognized the potential difficulties that could  arise with this essay. It was also recognized  that the blatant sex stereotyping in this  essay could be used as a vehicle for helping  students in recognizing stereotyping in  materials that they read."  Come on, McGeer.
