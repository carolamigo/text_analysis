SORWUC WINS HISTORIC VICTORY  On June 14, the United Bank Workers  (Local 2 of SORWUC) won a tremendous and far-reaching victory.  On that day, the Canada Labour Relations Board, in a precedent-  setting decision, ruled that a  single bank branch is an appropriate unit for bargaining.  This  means that if a majority of employees in a branch join a union,  that union will become the bargaining unit with the Bank. The Board  rejected a management claim that a  national bargaining unit would be  necessary.  It based its decision  on SORWUC's application for eight  Bank of Commerce branches.  For the first time, Canadian bank  workers know they have the practical right to bargain collectively.  This is not only a triumph for the  bank workers, but a significant  decision for all working women in  Canada, 72% of whom work in the  service, office and,retail industries.  It is one of the biggest  steps forward in this decade for  women in waged work.  There are approximately 15,000  'bank workers in B.C.  Most are female. Their average starting wage  is less than half of the average  B.C. wage.  The right to bargain  on a bank-by-bank basis will allow  these workers to negotiate for higher wages and better working conditions.  OMBUDS  Many bank employees in B.C. have  been waiting for this decision before joining the United Bank Workers.  In expectation of the response from employees across the  province, the United Bank Workers  are in the process of setting up  organizing committees in Port  Alberni, Nanaimo, Victoria, Prince  George, Kamloops, Kitimat-Terrace,  Powell River, Sechelt Peninsula,  the Kootenays and the Okanagan.  Further, by the end of June, every  bank branch in the Lower Mainland  had been leafletted.  The importance of this decision  cannot be over-emphasized. A labour reporter with Southam newsservice, put it in the following perspective: "Canada may be in for a  vast new wave of unionism, comparable to the organization of government workers in the past decade and  that of factory workers in the two  decades before that. Last week's  decision...may stand as a landmark."  The unionization of the service,  office and retail sector (where the  majority of women work) could well  be the major labour struggle of the  next decade, he said.  There are half a million Canadian  workers in "finance and industry" -  the category in which bank workers  will unionize.  Less than one percent is unionized, so far, and *;ages  lag significantly.  The United Bank Workers are facing  a massive task, but an exciting one,  in which all B.C. feminists could  become vitally involved.  Call the  United Bank Workers, Local 2 of  SORWUC at 681-2811 or 684-2834. If  you live in one of the areas where  they are setting up organizing committees, you can become involved by  writing to UNITED BANK WORKERS,  #1116-207 West Hastings, Vancouver.

We believe that collective clinics  will be a more feminist, more effective method  of helping sisters in our struggle for justice.  In the past, individual women have come to us  and we in turn have listened to each one and  provided information and offered support. We  acted in those areas in which we  are competent  and referred them to others with special expertise. We know"; however, that the problems  arise from the structure and attitudes of our  society.

LETTERS  KINESIS:  I am so glad that I have finally renewed my membership and am receiving  Kinesis again. The women's movement  has really added to my development  and the raising of my bourgeoise  consciousness.  This is an ongoing  experience and sometimes it is painful to realize that certain traits  I do not admire I possess.  In exposing examples of sexism, for example, I realize how insidiously  sexist attitudes are implicit in  some of my actions, without me realizing it. And I see it all around  me, starting at the school and encouraged on every level.  I think  that sexism is not only discrimination against women but a degrading  of sexual pleasure as not a valid  need. Yet I get confused a lot of  the time and put off by the feminist  women themselves, even as I most admire them.  I was in the audience at the East  Cultural Center trying to deal with  "The Eunuchs of the Forbidden Pleasure City" when a group of women  left chanting and creating a horrible stink.  I thought the play made  men look a whole lot more silly,  and that the play was trying to  come to grips with the whole issue  of perversion (using sex to gain  power) and sexual repression.  The  Empress finally gets the courage  to express her need - which is a  great achievement for a repressed  personality - and I appreciated the  fact that she used the sacred royal  seal for pleasure - but above and  beyond the merits of the individual  play I could think of a whole lot  of other targets mainly because I  believe the Tamahous Theatre Collective is not sexist, and is indeed more or less on the same side  as the feminists.  If there were  those who disagree then maybe - in  the interests of working together  against the real foes and not creating antagonism amongst allies in  spite of creative differences - this  could have been confronted in a more  constructive way.  The incident  created a bad impression because I  felt the target was misplaced.  For  the rest of the last half of the  play I endured the smell and brooded on motivations.  Then, horrid  thought - was I wrong, as a feminist, to find challenges in the play,  to have been digging it? Well,  these are the uncomfortable questions that speed growth.  I was not  going to renew my subscription or  continue to develop as a feminist:  but once the process is started,  there's no stopping it.  The movement has given the courage to continue and I hope some day to be  able to make a contribution.  Yours truly, M. Azwel, N. Vancouver  KINESIS:  As a member of the Vernon Women's  Centre Society I have read Kinesis  with great enjoyment, and it is  with pleasure that I enclose a  cheque for a year's subscription.  Because of lack of funding, our  centre has been closed, tho' as a  Society we are still active.  Keep up your fine work - Kinesis  is stimulating, informative, a  delight to read.  Muriel Hurry  KINESIS:  I have been a longstanding subscriber to your publication and appreciate your contributions in the  struggle to improve the status of  women.  I promoted your publication  between friends, both men and women  because I believe that you fulfill  an important role in the community.  I would like to make a few comments  regarding published letters on sex  and sexism in your recent issue.  Nobody would question the importance  of sex education.  However, I consider that the amount of space allocated to this subject is out of  proportion to the more important  socioeconomic and cultural needs  of womanhood. Exploitation of sexism for business promotion should  obviously be condemned and opposed.  I object however to glorification  of lesbianism which is an infrequent  variant of sexual behavior and as  such should be accepted without  prejudice and no special comments  or publicity is needed.  A letter about masturbation as a  mean of sexual satisfaction and a  way to discharge inner tension I  consider naive and simplistic. In  a sense it could be psychologically  harmful.  Such a person would be  better advised to have counselling  with a competent person.  I hope that in the future the editorial board will be more discriminative in accepting for publication letters of dubious value and  particularly those which are essentially incorrect and therefore misleading.  Yours sincerely, L. Zeldowicz, M.D.  KINESIS:  I appreciate your gift of the Kinesis  and look forward to that contact with  Vancouver Status of Women each issue.  I would like to see more letters from  C.R. groups sharing their experiences  and what kinds of projects they are  working on as an inspiration.  At present the C.R. group I am in is  reading "Women as Winners" together  and taking the steps of awareness together during our discussion period.  We are finding this a valuable growth  experience.  In Sisterhood, Gail Woodward  1736 Kenmore Road  Victoria, B.C. WHAT  SHOULD  OUR  MINISTER BE  LEARNING  goals of the  women's  movement  GOAL A - That which must be learned.  Learning Outcomes  A. I - to define the term "sexism".  A.2 - to read,  identify and understand written material  which is sexist.  A.3 - to write neatly and legibly  terms of reference for the  consultant who is  "taking  care" of sexism within the  ministry.  A.4 - to listen to a short presentation by women's groups  recognizing the main ideas  being presented about sexism in education.  A.5 - to recognize and count letters of complaint.  VSW   AGM  Centre: Lee Grills,   VSW President 77-78  The Annual General Meeting of Vancouver Status of Women took place  Tuesday, June 21st.  Elected to the  Executive were: PRESIDENT - Lee  Grills; VICE-PRESIDENT - Carol Norman: TREASURER - Noreen Garrity;  SECRETARY - Joey Thompson.  Six  MEMBERS-AT-LARGE were elected. They  are: Reva Dexter, Sandra Rose, Cara  Joy Hughes, Shirley Barnet, Jane  Evans, and Jillian Riddington.  The Annual Report was presented,  and interested persons can obtain  a copy from our offices for $1.00  plus 50c handling.  Donations of $265 were received.  Thank you,  sisters! .  On June 23, representatives from women's  groups converged on Victoria to meet  with Education Minister Pat McGeer to  discuss sexism in education. The visit  was a follow-up to the Education lobby  at Women Rally for Action (WRA), March  '76.  Has McGeer learned anything in more  than a year? Seems not. "I'm fuzzy  about sexism in education", he said,  "I don't think it's been documented."  Feminists representing Victoria Status  of Women, Burnaby Women's Group, North  Shore Women's Centre, Vancouver Status  of Women and the B.C.Federation of Women tried once again to raise the Minister's consciousness.  Their -priority was that McGeer respond  to the demands made at the WRA- They  sought a commitment from the Minister  stating that the elimination of sex  discrimination from the schools of  B.C. is a priority issue, and that  this commitment include a plan of  action, a timetable, and allocation  of funds to ensure that the plan is  implemented.  The delegation met not only with Mc  Geer but with Scott Wallace (Leader  of the P.C's), Denis Cocke (Education  critic for the Opposition), Dave  Barrett (NDP Leader) and contacted  Gordon Gibson (Leader, Liberals).  Above: Artist's Impression of the Hon.  Patrick McGeer in the Legislature...  Scott Wallace raised the issue in  the House. McGeer responded with the  comment that he had received NO COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST YEAR ABOUT SEXISM  IN THE SCHOOLS. Scott Wallace, however, was able to show McGeer his  carbon copy of a letter of complaint  sent to McGeer by VSW.  The moral of this is: we MUST send  carbon copies of letters of complaint  to our own MLA's and the Opposition  leaders, so that McGeer won't be  able to get away with such remarks.  McGeer's major response to the delegation was to suggest that we are  making mountains out of molehills.  He suggests that the issue has already  been dealt with. One responsibility of  one curriculum consultant is to monitor  texts for sexism. This part-part-time  job carries no terms of reference. To  say that this takes care of the issue  is laughable.  A further irony is that McGeer's executive assistant suggested that his  Ministry had been responsible for the  booklet, Equal Treatment of the Sexes.  In fact, the Socreds are responsible  for the abolition of the Provincial  Advisory Committee on Sex Discrimination which produced that pamphlet.  Help educate McGeer. Send him your  complaints with cc. to VSW, and the  local MLA and the opposition  Childcare—being choked  "Anomalous, inconsistent and contradictory." That's how Kirstie Shool-  briad, UBC Daycare Coordinator describes the draft of the Provincial  Childcare Regulations.  "It is evident that further fresh input is  necessary to achieve reasonable results," she said.  Shoolbriad commented on the general  childcare picture in B.C.: "These  Regulations jam childcare even more  firmly into the welfare scene. And  childcare, as part of the welfare  structure, is in the process of being choked in this province."  What has happened to childcare for  the under 3s? The Regulations effectively wipe it out.  1. The former childcare grouping of  18 months to 3 years is under fire,  and a compromise group of 24 months  to 4 years has been substituted.  The ratio of staff to children has  been increased for the younger  children.  2. The proposed subsidy of $140  will not meet staff and centre costs.  It is the parents who will be asked  to find the extra money.  Under the  new system it will be difficult to  fund, with children in two subsidy  categories (under 3/over 3).  3. In-home caregivers are being  asked to provide more for less. The  caregiver has no worker protection  and the ratio of children to caregiver has been raised to seven to  one.  Caregivers have not been asked to improve their standards, and  will now be taking care of more  children while running a home at  the same time.  Again, it's the  children who are going to lose out.  4. Regulations for disabled children  could be discriminatory - they could  be interpreted to prevent a disabled child who could cope with a  normal centre from attending that  centre.  "The inability of the government to  solve daycare financial problems is  being carried by parents and children.  Perhaps the government hopes  that these regulations will solve  their problems.  But they won't,"  concluded Shoolbriad. Maternity  Benefits  Bliss Decision  Upholds Sexism  The Federal Court of Canada ruled  June 7 that the Unemployment Insurance Act does not discriminate against women.  It only discriminates  against pregnant people.  The Attorney General of Canada had  appealed a UIC umpire's decision  that a Vancouver woman, Stella Bliss  had been discriminated against by  reason of sex. A member of SORWUC  (Service, Office and Retail Workers'  Union of Canada), Bliss was fired  from her job in early January 1976.  The cause was pregnancy.  She applied for UIC benefits.  She was  disqualified from receiving maternity benefits as she was neither receiving UIC benefits nor engaged  in employment during the ten weeks  surrounding the birth of her child.  She was disqualified from regular  benefits because she was pregnant.  Eliss took a complaint regarding her  firing because of pregnancy before  the B.C. Human Rights Commission  and won her job back.  She then  worked until mid-March, when she  was again fired. The second firing took place on a Friday, and the  following Tuesday she gave birth  to her son. She was cleared by  her doctor as being fit to work  commencing the following Monday.  She made adequate arrangements for  the care of her child so that she  could return to work.  She was unable to find a job, so she applied  for regular benefits because she  was looking for a job.  She was  denied regular benefits, because  the recent birth of her child meant  that she was covered by the regulations pertaining to maternity benefits.  Authorizes  Discrimination  Kinesis has followed the intricacies of the Bliss case with some zeal  because the decisions made upon her  case are absolutely vital to the women's movement.  In brief, the issue  is that women are discriminated against because they bear children.  Part of the umpire's decision, now  overturned by the Federal Court,  read: "I am driven to the inescapable conclusion that Section (46)  ...accidentally perhaps, authorizes  discrimination by reason of sex, and  as a consequence, abridges the right  of equality of all claimants in respect of the Unemployment Insurance  Commission."  The Federal Court decision, which upheld discriminatory practices against  women, made the following four points:  1.  Unemployment caused by pregnancy  is something different from unemployment caused by sickness or unemployment which gives rise to the payment  of regular benefits.  "Of course UIC doesn't discriminate  against women —it only bars pregnant  people from receiving benefits."  2. Unemployment caused by pregnancy,  unlike other kinds of unemployment  which give rise to payment of benefits, is usually the result of a  voluntary act.  3. Possibly, Parliament, when designing the Act, considered it desirable that pregnant women refrain  from work for 14 weeks during the  occasion of her confinement. Women  are not available for work during  that time, and should accordingly  receive a different kind of benefit  from those who are.  4. The legislation does not infringe  on anybody's right to equality before the law.  Feminist Response  To which feminists respond:  1. Why is pregnancy sp different  from any other temporary disability  to work? Shades of Victoriana. How  is pregnancy different from any  other disability with a predictable  time limit - e.g. a prostatectomy?  2. The fear behind this one is that  shameless women will get pregnant  just so they can live off UIC.  3. Why should Parliament think that  14 weeks is the magic number? The  woman is the person who should make  the choice about whether or not she  is able to work.  4. The legislation enfringes on the  rights of pregnant workers.  It discriminates by reason of sex and is  therefore contrary to the Canadian  Bill of Rights.  VSW is glad to hear that the lawyers  representing Bliss are considering  another appeal. The Act must accord  pregnant women the same rights as  other members of the labour force  as well as provide them with special benefits for the period surrounding their confinement regardless of whether or not they were  working or receiving benefits when  they became pregnant.  The Bliss case is not the only current example of discrimination against pregnant workers. Members  of the Association of University  and College Employees (AUCE), Locals 1 and 2, are facing threats  that 25 of their workers will have  to PAY BACK to the Unemployment  Insurance Commission benefits which  accrued to them as part of the clause  in their contract pertaining to maternity benefits.  Again, AUCE's case is somewhat complex  plex, but it is imperative that we  take the time to familiarize ourselves with it. Again, what is at  stake is the right of pregnant workers to be treated in a non-sexist  way.  AUCE contracts  During negotiations in May of 1974,  the Association of University and  College Employees, Local 1 (UBC)  initially proposed a clause pertaining to paid maternity benefits.  A representative for the University  of British Columbia agreed in principle with the union's proposal and  stated that he would give it very  serious consideration if it met with  the terms of Unemployment Insurance  legislation.  In late September 1974  the two parties signed the proposal  after investigation with representatives of the Unemployment Insurance Commission.  Article 31.07 Maternity Leave  (a) in case of pregnancy, a continuing or sessional employee shall  not lose seniority entitlement.  She shall receive the benefits of  the Maternities Provision of the  Unemployment Insurance Act.  Upon  return to work, the employee shall  be reinstated in her former position and the employer shall pay  the difference of the benefits received and the employee's monthly  salary. After returning to work  should the employee resign or be  severed for just cause within six  months the Union will pay the University the amount paid by the  University to the employee for  maternity leave.  The information received by union  representatives during discussions  with the Commission was heartening.  AUCE was told that because their  clause dictated that the University  paid supplemental benefits after the  period in which UIC benefits were  received and in the form of a lump  sum, that such benefits were not  considered earnings but rather as  a bonus.  AUCE was also told that  this "baby bonus" was a negotiable  item outside of the Commission's  jurisdiction and was viewed as an  incentive to individual employees  to encourage them to return to work.  The union and the University negotiated the resulting maternity provisions firstlyj in recognition of Any group of individual wishing more  information or a copy of the brief  can contact Melody at 681-7875, or  Cathy at 255-4946, or AUCE-SFU at  291-4433.  Much of this information is from a. brief prepared by AUCE/SORWC  the financial needs arising from a  woman's temporary inability to work  during late pregnancy and convalescence and secondly, feeling confident that such provisions in no way  jeopardized a woman's eligibility  for established legislative benefits (UIC).  In the spring of 1975, after Local  1's successful negotiation of maternity provisions, AUCE Local 2  also succeeded in incorporating  maternity provisions in their contract.  Their provisions are as follows :  Article 35 - Maternity Leave  35.01 B.C. Maternity Protection Act  All continuing, female employees  shall be eligible for leave from  work as provided by the B.C. Maternity Protection act; up to eight  (8) weeks before and at least six  (6) weeks following confinement,  to a maximum of sixteen (16) weeks.  Any pregnant employee may utilize  vacation credits to provide partial income continuance during Maternity Leave.  35.02 UIC Maternity Benefits  The University will assist employees in applying for benefits under the Maternities Provisions of  the Unemployment Insurance Act.  35.03 Accrual of Seniority  Seniority will continue to accrue  during Maternity Leave.  35.04 Additional Leave  Any additional time requested will  be covered by the article on Extended Leave.  35.05 Continuance of Employee  Benefits  The employee shall, during the  term of such leave, pay one hundred percent (100%) of benefit  premiums.  35.06 Reimbursement Following  Return to Work  Two (2) months after the employee's return to work the University  shall reimburse in a lump sum: a)  the University's portion of benefit premiums, and b) the difference  between the UIC Maternity benefits  received, and the employee's normal  salary for the duration of the UIC  Maternity benefit period.  Until a few months ago, both Simon  Fraser University and University of  B.C. were meeting the obligations  established by these clauses. Early  in 1977 representatives of UBC contacted UIC about AUCE Local l's  clause.  This contact was likely to  have been precipitated by the lengthy  contract negotiations between UBC  and Local 1 during which the union  had proposed a new concept in maternity provisions.  During ensuing  weeks, UIC officials contacted UBC  frequently - apparently there were  problems with the maternity provisions which had been in effect for  two years.  UBC reported to the  union that Commission officials had  maintained that the established contract provisions resulted in women  being over paid for maternity leave  and that it was their intention to  recover any overpayment.  To date,  AUCE has yet to receive any written  confirmation directly from UIC of  either their concerns or their intentions.  The union has had to  contend with second and thirdhand  information.  On March 21, 1977 the Unemployment  Commission sent a letter to Simon  Fraser University stating:  "Pursuant to our meeting this morning I attach copies of the relevant  sections of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Section 30(5) relates to  earnings in the maternity period  while Regulation 173(4) and Sections  51 and 52 refer to allocation of  earnings and subrogation aspects.  AUCE  accused of  "topping up"  "It's apparent that the 'Topping Up'  of maternity benefits in vogue at  SFU can only result in overpayment  of unemployment insurance benefits  to maternity claimants..."  A letter sent to the University cf  British Columbia on February 28,  1977 states with reference to women  covered by UBC's collective agreement:  "by returning to your employ and  receiving the maternity leave benefits, after receiving unemployed  benefits, there'was a conflict with  Section 30(5) of the Unemployment  Insurance Act and Regulation 173 (4)  This created an overpayment which,  of course, we must recover from the  claimants."  The Unemployment Insurance Commission  has not contacted the unions involved  who for the most part, have had to  rely on verbal statements made to  them by UIC or relayed to them  through the University's management.  TThether the Act and Regulations support their claim that our clauses  result in overpayment is not at all  clear; nor is it clear whether other  regulations of the Act prevent us  from negotiating a different and acceptable clause. What is clear, however, is that either the Act and  Regulations or the broad power rendered to the Commissioners to interpret the Act as they wish prevents  or will intimidate women from negotiating a clause that provides maintenance of salary when on maternity  leave.  SB Br&flAYfl*)  M^*wuiL  Furthermore, decisions interpreting  sections of the Act and Regulations  are not available in the Library for  the period from 1974 on. Only some  of the decisions subsequent to 1974  are available at the Unemployment  Insurance offices as others are not  intended as precedents.  The unavailability of decisions;  the sweeping powers given to the  Commission in matters of interpretation and creation of regulations;  and the existence of Sections 30.5,  45 and Regulation 172 (with its  maternity only prohibition), indicates that the present coverage of  maternity leave under the Unemployment Insurance Act is inadequate.  It punishes women for having babies  and discriminates against them by  refusing to allow financial protection to be negotiated in a contract.  Can it be that UIC feels that allowing additional monies to be paid to  women during or after pregnancy  would be contrary to the spirit of  the Unemployment Insurance Act by  destroying a woman's incentive to  work (outside the home) and merely  encourage her to take time off and  have babies!  If so, why may unions  negotiate supplemental benefit  plans that provide for additional  monies to be paid during temporary  periods of work shortage?  It seems clear that the Unemployment Insurance Act must be amended  so that regulation 172(3) excludes  payments to women on maternity leave  from the definition of "earnings"  for the purpose of the Act.  If maternity leave and maternity  financing policies are not amended  by the federal government soon, more  and more working women (and men)  will be forced to choose between  working and having children.  This  gives rise to some interesting questions .  Will the right to have  children become a function of our  income and class (presently 55% of  married working women live in families whose annual income is less  than $9,000)? Will the ability to  have children be based on whether  or not a woman can find a man whose  income is high enough to support  her and a family without supplementation by her labour outside the  home?  Immediate Relief  Needed  What is obviously needed in this era  of increasing unemployment, wage  cuts and soaring profits is some  immediate relief for working women  and men who choose to start families,  as well as some long range planning  to create policies encompassing financed maternity leave and financed  child care expenses.  Employers and  the State must recognize the special  role imposed on women by their biology as the continuors of their species.  To separate this role from  the woman's increasingly important  role as an integral part of the economy is to practise a serious form  of discrimination and to be blind  to the fact that economic independence is one of the main solutions  to the problems faced by so many  women and men today. ifl ^  3 \  STEWARDESSES FIGHT SEXISM  The Canadian Air Line Flight Attendants' Association (CALFAA) is  still fighting for the right of  stewardesses to work until the seventh month of pregnancy, as guaranteed by the Canada Labour Code.  CALFAA maintains that stewardesses  should not be forced out of their  jobs, and that decisions about working during pregnancy should be made  by the employee, in consultation  with her doctor.  We Have NO  Human Rights  Since the airlines fall under federal jurisdiction, stewardesses are  not covered by any Human Rights Code.  "We have absolutely no human rights,"  says Shirley Poole, CALFAA National  President.  "We have had to negotiate for them every inch of the way."  CALFAA has had to fight for the right  of stewardesses to work after marriage, and to work for even the  first four months of pregnancy.  When asked if the passage of the  proposed Human Rights legislation  would bring stewardesses some protection, Poole responded "Yes, if  we live that long."  Currently, CALFAA has a case before  Pacific Western concerning a 'mandatory leave of absence' for stewardesses after the first four months  of pregnancy. The case went before  a Surrey judge (who expressed his  surprise that pregnant women were  allowed UIC benefits!), and then his  ruling against CALFAA was appealed  by the Federal Justice department,  with strong support from the Advisory Council for the Status of Women  (ACSW).  In what is known at the  CATLISSE DECISION, the stewardesses  lost, because the judge decided that  the contract (allowing for mandatory  lay-off after the first four months)  superceded the Canada Labour Code.  CALFAA National Pres. Shirley Poole  explained, "This leaves the distinction between mandatory leave of  absence and lay-off a grey area."  "The Airlines don't want to spoil  their image of stewardesses as  glamorous sex objects," Poole commented, "any suggestion that stewardesses might be married, and even  worse, that they might be pregnant,  damages that image."  Claiming that in the absence of  federal codes, provincial human  rights legislation should prevail,  CALFAA took cases to the B.C., Ontario, and Quebec Human Rights Commissions.  B.C. Human Rights Commission, however, decided that the  matter did not fall within provincial jurisdiction.  Air Canada was the only airline that  agreed to abide by the Canada Labour  Code, but upon discovery that Pacific Western and Canadian Pacific  were getting away with non-compliance, they reversed their stand,  deciding to force pregnant stewardesses to submit to compulsory  medical examinations every two weeks.  CALFAA fought this one in Montreal,  on the grounds that it was a contract violation and an invasion of  privacy. The stewardesses won the  decision. But AIR CANADA is still in  negotiations with CALFAA. They maintain their position, despite the decision, that pregnant stewardesses must  submit to the company's doctors examinations every two weeks!  An interesting statistic is that the  average stewardess' girth at seven  months pregnancy is equal to that of  the average 44-year-old male.  The airlines claim that this is not  a matter of sex discrimination but  one of health and safety.  Pregnant  passengers are not barred from  flight, nor are overweight pilots  considered a liability to passenger  safety during emergencies. We can  only conclude that the airlines  wish to lay off pregnant stewardesses because they believe their  proper place is in the home, where  they can't frighten the passengers.  The Justice Department appeal on  the CATLISSE DECISION is coming up  this fall.  CALFAA would appreciate  the continuing support of the women's movement in their struggle.

Cathy Pike and Melody Rudd has spoken to BCFW on behalf of the Simon  Fraser University Association of  University and College Employees  (AUCE, Local 2).  Melody and Cathy stressed the importance of job and economic security for women in connection with  maternity leave. Without that and  adequate daycare, they stated, there  is no true equality for women in  the workforce.  Discrimination  What is the Present Extent of Federal  Discrimination Against Maternity?  Section 30.5 of the UIC Act states  that any women receiving maternity  benefits under Section 30 will have  all monies received from sources outside her UIC deducted from her benefits.  For all other workers, only  earnings in excess of 25% of their  benefit rate are deducted from benefits paid.  Section 46 of the UIC Act states  that a woman who does not qualify  for maternity benefits under Section  30 cannot receive regular benefits  until she has waited out her full  maternity period - 8 weeks before  and 6 weeks after her expected date  of confinement. When questioned as  to the rationale for this section,  a UIC official stated that it was to  prevent administrative abuse - i.e.  to prevent a woman from becoming  pregnant and then going out and  working a bit so she can qualify for  regular benefits.  This is an insult  as well as an example of discrimination. Women's wages are already low  enough that 2/3 of the average woman's salary would hardly cover the  extra expenses incurred by maternity.  Section 172 of the UIC Regulations  allows for SUB plans.  The guide-r  lines developed by the Commission  to administer these plans states  that any SUB plan must cover a  worker for temporary work shortage  but it cannot only cover a worker  for temporary layoff due to pregnancy .  Illness - A person who takes a leave  of absence from work, for illness  which can include elective surgery,  is entitled to receive benefits for  a period of time, depending on qualifications (proving labour force  attachment).  However, pregnancy is  not treated this way. Pregnant  women have to meet special qualifications, under Section 30.  Section 173.4 and 173.9 of the UIC  Regulations state further that  monies received in respect of a  period of unemployment or bonuses  are to be considered earnings and  therefore deducted from any UIC  benefits.  This clearly makes it  difficult for union women to negotiate any special maternity benefits as the Act now stands.  What Changes Could Be Made?  1. Remove Section 30.5 from the UIC  Act.  2. Add an "f" to Section 172.3  which would identify monies paid  for maternity purposes as non-earnings for the purposes of the Act.  3. Remove Section 46 from the Act.  And Some Long-Range Suggestions...  4. Introduction of new legislation  at the federal level which would  provide for a fully-paid maternity  leave, cost to be borne by the government or employer, or a combination of the two, depending on the  size of the operation.  5. Introduction of federal legislation which would foster the creation of adequate child care facilities and which would allow the cost  of these to be borne by.the government. CORPORATE^  PROFITS! -  PREGNANT BUT EQUAL?  by Valerie Capece  In the US too, women are challenging the denial of maternity benefits. There, too, the law is resisting their demands. The US  Supreme Court has upheld the company's "right" to deny benefits to  pregnant women which it grants to  other temporarily disabled employees. Majority Report, a New York  feminist newspaper, provides the  following details about the situation:  Do any men you know get pregnancy  disability benefits?  Probably not,  but the Supreme Court decision of  December 7, 1976 that companies  need not include pregnancy benefits  in their disability plans for women  if they don't also cover men seems  to imply that companies covering  expectant mothers must also cover  expectant fathers.  The first of many demonstrations to  end discrimination against pregnant  workers was held by the New York  Campaign to End Discrimination  Against Pregnant Workers, outside  the Brooklyn Union Gas Company on  Montague Street on April 13.  Brooklyn Union employee Marsha  Spinowitz sued her company for  pregnancy benefits while carrying  her oldest son four years ago.  Spinowitz took part in the demonstration during her lunch hour with  her two children who wore posters  saying, "I am not paid for" and  "I'm half paid for, I think!".  Among the other companies refusing  to include pregnancy in their disability plans in defiance of the  1965 State Human Rights Law are  AT&T, Corning Glass, Merrill Lynch  and American Airlines.  The campaign began in February and  by March 15, the group had already  gotten bills introduced in Congress  to amend Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 to state specifically that discrimination on the  basis of pregnancy constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex and  is therefore illegal.  They are  also requesting retroactive benefits for all women who have been  denied coverage since 1965, since  pregnant women have been typically  refused responsible jobs, fired,  forced to take unpaid leave regardless of ability to work, and refused the right fo use accumulated  sick leave or vacation for reasons  of pregnancy.  The Supreme Court case upheld General Electric's right to deny  pregnant workers disability benefits that are given to all other  temporarily disabled employees.  Examples of 'illnesses' for which  disability compensation is given  are: hair transplants, cosmetic  surgery (face lifts, derriere  lifts, etc.), vasectomies, hernia  operations, and car accidents (even  if caused by drunk driving).  Exempted from coverage, however, are  abortion and pregnancy.  WAR MAKES PLANS  OPEN LETTER TO ALL WOMEN'S GROUPS IN  BRITISH COLUMBIA FROM "WOMEN AGAINST  RAPE"  Early in April a small group of women  in Nanaimo began discussing the need  for concrete action in various areas  of women's oppression.  Concern and  outrage that women cannot walk down  a street safely and that we must  live in fear for our children, led  us to the formation of WOMEN AGAINST  RAPE.  It was apparent to us that men control women by the threat of rape and  that society supports this control  through the legal system, sexist  media, fashions, pornography, prostitution, violent advertising, etc.  While we knew that we wanted to work  towards stopping rape, it was clear  to us that we could not make significant changes on our own. Because  the B.C. Federation of Women is an  effective vehicle for uniting women  in action we applied for membership.  At the May 28th and 29th standing  committee meeting in Nelson it was  decided that BCFW would join with  WAR in DECLARING NOVEMBER 5TH A  PROVINCIAL DAY OF PROTEST AGAINST  THE CRIME OF RAPE.,  BCFW authorized WAR to act as coordinators for province-wide activity,  utilizing the Regional Representatives as contact people between member groups and non-member supporters  in their regions and WAR.  These,  and other contact people will be  responsible for aiding and strongly  encouraging women in communities  throughout B.C. to take concrete,  visible, public and publicized action on November 5th.  This action  could be marches or demonstrations.  Because all women, regardless of  their level of ^feminist consciousness, realize that they and their  children are potential victims and  because this aetion is designed to  take place in as many communities  MORE WAR PLANS:  'ñ†as possible.  Declaring November 5th as a provincial day of protest against rape  not only brings it to the attention  of the public but also provides a  vehicle that will encourage and support women who are not presently involved in the women's movement to  unite in action with us.  Women in some communities have, despite inadequate funding and lack of  cooperation from police, lawyers and  doctors, been able to develop Rape  Relief Centres.  These Centres provide essential support for victims  of rape, education regarding necessary medical and legal procedures,  and also work toward changing laws  which discriminate against women.  More Rape Relief Centres are needed;  there are currently only four in the  province.  Action could be focussed  around this need.  The WAR collective intends to work  beyond the November 5th action. Our  goals are that women will:  a) form  groups for support and protection;  b) see rape as part of the total  oppression of women and, therefore,  its relationship to sexist and violent advertising, fashions, sex-role  stereotyping, etc. and c) use this  knowledge to develop strategies for  action in these other areas of women's oppression.  The average rapist is the man-next-  door.   The inoffensive one...  The typical rapist is NOT a strange  man in a dark alley.  Most rapists  are acquaintances...  To reach these women, we need your  help.  WE ARE ASKING THAT EVERY  GROUP SUPPLY US WITH A COPY OF THEIR  MAILING LIST.  We intend to publish  a weekly newsletter which will be  sent directly to these women and  will also be published in all provincial feminist newsletters. We  will use the establishment media as  well.  WE NEED CONTACT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT  THE PROVINCE. If you or any women  you know want to be involved in developing action in your community,  please let us know. Also please  contact the Regional Representative  in your area. We have enclosed a  list of their names and addresses.  TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT NOVEMBER 5TH.  WOMEN AGAINST RAPE  614 Milton Street  Nanaimo, B.C. V9R 2L5  (753-9920) U.S. News  U.S. TEXTILE WOMEN AND THE  STEVENS BOYCOTT  Textile labour, originally performed  by women in their homes as a part of  their domestic labour, has traditionally been regarded as an extension  of household work, and textile women  share many of the problems of other  workers in jobs considered "women's  work", such as nurses, food service  workers, cleaners and domestic workers.  Such occupations are always  among the lowest paid classifications of employment and the last industries to be organized into unions.  The textile industry is no exception;  with a labour force of over half  women, it reported a U.S. national  wage average in 1975 of S3.19 an hour,  $1.40 below the national factory average.  In the vanguard of the textile industry's war on women is the giant J.P.  Stevens and Co., second largest textile manufacturer in the world, with  85 plants employing some 44,000 workers.  Always an industry leader,  Stevens has set a grim example for  U.S. employers by breaking one law  after another in its efforts to defeat union organizing campaigns in  its mills.  Not only has Stevens  flouted the regulations of the National Labour Relations Board and the  EEOC, preferring to spend millions  in fines for violations rather than  obey the law, it has also repeatedly  ignored citations by the Occupational  Health and Safety Administration,  graphically illustrating the attitude that working women's bodies are  expendable.  Even in the few plants that have  succeeded in organizing and voting  for a union, the company has continued to fight union representation,  in one case even closing down a  plant that had recently organized, a  tactic the same company employed over  and over again during the forties and  fifties, when they closed down Northern textile mills in which the union  was already well established. Unfair  employment and promotion policies,  low wages and dangerous working conditions for women in Stevens textile  mills will continue until they can  protect themselves through union  representation and collective bargaining.  J.P. Stevens and Co. is  well aware of this and will continue in its obdurate and illegal opposition to organizing until public  pressure and legal action force them  to comply with the law.  The boycott  of J.P. Stevens' textile products  by the Amalgamated Clothing and  Textile Workers Union is public action in defense of Stevens workers  right to organize and to be represented by a union without fear of  reprisal or harrassment from their  employer, and to work in safety for  a decent wage.  J.P. Stevens products and brand  names include: Stevens, Utica, Mohawk, Simtex and Tastemaker, among  others.

The interview  was Conducted in Beirut, Lebanon in  early May.)  WHAT IS THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN OCCUPIED PALESTINE?"  In 1969 one of the western journalists said, "Everyone who visits the  West Bank can see that the struggle  is led by women." And this is true  because in 1967 (when Israel occupied this Palestinian area along  with the Gaza Strip) all the men  left or hid.  Women stayed and were leading the  demonstrations and having sit-ins  at the churches and mosques. They  were organizing themselves in commissions to visit prisoners, to  collect food and clothing for the  prisoners, and to demonstrate for  the prisoners.  They were organizing commissions to look after the  families of the martyrs (Palestinians who died in combat), to bring  them food, to collect money for  them, to look after the children.  And at the same time, the Palestinian woman played and still plays a  very big role in the armed struggle itself.  Of all the branches of the women's  union in the Arab countries, the  highest number of members is in the  West Bank.  We sell in Lebanon what  our union in the West Bank produces  - embroidery and dresses. We send  the money back to them because they  want to eat from this production.  We encouraged the opening of more  and more of our workshops in the  West Bank, so that Palestinian women wouldn't have to work in Israeli  factories. We encourage them to  work more and more with the union  and the Palestinian organizations.  WOULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE HISTORY  OF THE GENERAL UNION OF PALESTINIAN  WOMEN?  In 1919 in Jerusalem two women,  Zalikha Ishaq al-Shihabi and Milia  al-Sakakini, started founding the  first Palestinian women's union.  The old Palestinian women's union  led demonstrations against the British Mandate (in whicn the League  of Nations gave Britain authority  over Palestine after World War I),  against the immigration to Palestine, and against (the British)  taking prisoners to jail, and hanging them.  The organization was an answer to  the aggression against the Palestinian people.  From the beginning  it started on a political basis,  and was mainly to organize Palestinian women to participate more  and more in the struggle to liberate Palestinian land.  In 1936, the Palestinian women  joined the armed struggle and we  had many martyrs in the mountains  at that time.  When the PLO started  (in 1964) the women started thinking about reorganizing themselves.  So we held a congress in Jerusalem  in 1965.  After one year, King Hussein (of  Jordan, which ruled the Palestinian  "West Bank" area from 1948 to 1967  when Israel took it) prohibited the  PLO there.  So we started struggling secretly in Palestine.  After the war of 1967, the union  had to reorganize itself again.  We had a big meeting in Amman,  Jordan and elected a new executive  committee.  The struggle went on  in the West Bank and Palestine and  many of our members led demonstrations against the (Israeli) occupation in Palestine.  turn to page 19... Some white people are real good  and some are  like dogs.     I say  this because I have girls,   too.  I see what it's done with my  nieces in Inuvik,  Mr.  Berger.  My sister is. right here in this  meeting.    My niece was a nice  girl until one day one white  came along and told her that he  was single.    After,  she became  an alcoholic, and that white  man is gone.  "All that makes me mad.    That's  why I don't like the pipeline.  These are my nieces,  they 're  just like my own girls.    Now I  worry about my own girls,   how   >  they will grow up.    When I hear  there 's going to be eight hundred people in every camp,  I  hope they will make a law that  the white people will have to  stay away from McPherson.   Like  I said before,  the white people  are good,  but some are not so  good."  Jane Charlie - July 1975  Fort McPherson,  NWT  Since March 1974, Canadian Arctic  Gas Pipeline Ltd., Foothills Pipeline Ltd. and the Alcan project  have filed with the Canadian government for permission to construct  a pipeline through the MacKenzie  Valley, MacKenzie Delta and the  Yukon.  These are all major gas  consortiums of joint American-Canadian ownership.  The federal government commissioned  three major reports to determine  the scope of the impact such a vast  energy corridor (2200 miles) would  bring to the Canadian North. Presently, the government is awaiting  reports from both the National Energy Board on the economic and environmental impact of these proposals  and from the Lysyk Inquiry (led by  Dean Lysyk of UBC) on the social,  economic and environmental impact  of the Alcan route through the  southern Yukon.  The third report, the MacKenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, led by Justice  Thomas Berger, was tabled in the  House of Commons on May 9, 1977.  This inquiry was. instructed to determine 'the social, environmental  and economic impact of the construction, operation and subsequent abandonment of the proposed natural gas  pipeline in the Yukon and the North  West Territories.'  Berger Report  Recommendations  The report, Northern Frontier-Northern Homeland, made several major  recommendations to the federal government.  Berger stated that:  * No pipeline be built across the  northern Yukon, as it would result  in irreparable environmental damage.  * No pipeline be built through the  MacKenzie Valley until the native  landclaims are settled.  A ten year  moratorium on any pipeline construction would allow time for this process.  * A wilderness park across the MacKenzie Delta, to function as a bird  sanctuary, should be established.  * A whale sanctuary should be formed  in the west MacKenzie Bay, to protect the white whales of the Beaufort Sea.  THE  PIPELINE:  The Plan  and the Price  by Nancy Rudge  An UPSTREAM article  The inquiry, which Berger described  as unprecedented in the industrialized world, took a unique form. Not  only were southern hearings held in  ten major cities across Canada, but  the inquiry travelled to three cities, and thirty-five towns and villages across the North. Native organizations, environmental groups,  northern business, northern municipalities and individuals gave test-  twenL'onf montir8"8" thr°Ugh TMMAN OF THE DENE NATION  twenty-one months.  Men Make Decisions—Women Cope  Mid 1976, a group of northern women  presented a brief to the socio-economic hearings in Yellowknife recommending that no pipeline be built.  They stated that perhaps the most  political aspect of development is  that women have no voice in x^hether  or not it Is to take place. Women  and children are traditionally ignored. Male-dominated and male-  oriented businesses and governments  make such decisions and women are  expected to cope with the social  and economic hardships which result.  Observing the results of the Alaskan  pipeline and other northern communities which have already been touched by development, the women expressed their concerns about the large  influx of families which would likely occur. Housing shortages would  increase prices.  Day care centres  (where they exist) would be full and  the schools would be placed on shifts  giving children much spare time, implying that women must remain in the  home or abandon their children. Medical and social service facilities  would be overtaxed.  The brief points out that alcoholism  coupled with the stress of isolation  in northern towns results in a marked increase of wife-beating and  family breakups.  The women also expressed fears about  the expected influx of male workers,  both married men coming north without their families and single men.  "In Alaskan communities close to  construction, the incidence of violent attacks on women, rape, illegitimate pregnancies, venereal disease and suicide has risen sharply.  "Now the residents must live with  violence in both camp and community,  because alcohol and weapons are  freely available, and an influx of  prostitutes."  These changes, upsetting the traditional way of life, could seriously  affect the future of the youth, the  report says.  "Teenagers are confused about sexual  behavior at the best of times and  under the best circumstances.  But  an imbalance in the number of males  caused by a massive development intensifies this confusion for young  girls and boys.  "In communities where the traditional pattern of life already has broken down, young girls have begun  drinking and are being taken advantage of sexually."  A young mother deciding to keep her  baby faces a difficult future. As  daycare is seldom available, it is  unlikely that she could work outside  the home.  Given the inflated costs ,  characterizing major development she  could not possibly feed, clothe and  shelter herself and her child on the  $200-$250 a month she would receive  on government assistance.  Further,  if the father of the child was a  pipeline worker who has returned to  the south, she could not force him  to support the child because the NWT  child support orders are unenforc-  able outside the territory.  The Yellowknife women offered the  following solutions:  * That the pipeline not be built.  * That native land claims be settled  justly and fairly.  * That an ombudsperson be appointed,  charged specifically with the right  to investigage violations of the  rights of women and children.  * That a NWT Human Rights Commission  be established.  * That medical and mental health  services in the North be upgraded.  * That adequate day care space be  set aside in all northern housing  developments.  * That school curriculums be altered to reflect and respect the cultures of the North, thereby providing an anchor and support for the  youth in the face of development.  * That family planning and sex education services be improved and that  the NWT develop a more equitable and  realistic approach to abortion. Pipeline will result in irreparable environment damage  No Jobs for Women  "The pipeline companies have made it  quite clear that they:would have no  jobs available for women during pipeline construction, apart from related  service jobs.  "On the other side of the continent,  however, Alyeska Pipeline Service  has been successfully employing women as about one-fifth of its workforce.  But it did so only because  it was required to agree to an  'affirmative action' programme as  part of its right-of-way permit."  Gina Blondin, Rosemary Cairns,  Valerie Hearder, Mary Kerton.  Summer 1976, Yellowknife NWT  Sexually Exploited  Testimonies talking about the sexual exploitation of women were salted  throughout the hearings. A Yellowknife doctor described the experience of Frobisher Bay:  "This contact was characterized by  a total lack of regard for native  people as human beings.  The male-  female contact was invariably sexually exploitive in nature. The  presence of a lot of money and easy  access to alcohol were the catalysts.  Young native women were drawn out by  these features from their normal  social patterns, and into patterns  of drunkenness and overt sexuality.  Little or no thought was given by  the men involved to the consequences  of their action. These actions were  totally irresponsible and devoid of  emotional content.  The effect on  the native women was socially, physically and culturally destructive.  They tended to be alienated from  their people and were left alone  to attend to their venereal disease,  illegitimate children and incipient  alcoholism.  "In the past the social stigma of  this type of contact happening occasionally could be absorbed. However, we have only to imagine this  effect multiplied by a factor of a  few thousand concentrated over three  winters.  It could be devastating.  We could calculate the cost in  terms of medical service. We could  even 'guesstimate' the cost of supportive social services, but it is  impossible to assess the cost, the  human price, for loss of dignity  and social alienation.  "Who is going to pay? The pipeline  company? the oil company? the people  of Canada? These people may pay  the dollars; we already know who is  going to pay the price in human misery."  Dr. Ross Wheeler  October 1975, Yellowknife NWT  A Yukon miner told the inquiry of  his experience with workers' attitudes in the North:  "As far as their attitude toward the  local natives, I feel very hesitant  about quoting...very often I have  heard of the local native women  talked about as squaws that can only  be fucked..."  Bob Cooper  August 1975, whitehorse, Yukon  And a mother in a small community  asked Berger:  "It means, if these men come, they  will take our young women away for  a year or two. Like the pipeline  project will be going on for three  years.  They will take our young  women away, probably shack up with  them, make them pregnant, and leave  them alone after the job is done.  What will these young women do? They  don't have education.  Where will  they get the money to support their  children, and what will they do for  a living?"  Marie Anne Jeremicka  August 1976, Lac la Martre NWT  Throughout the hearings, people talked of their concerns for the future  of families, their children and their  children's children.  Concerns about  loss of culture and dignity; concerns of physical and mental well-  being; and worries about future  economic stability.  "I am 57 years old and have eight  children and grand-children.  I am  going against the pipeline which  will give my children trouble and  hardship. Everyone of you here love  your children.  Do you want them to  suffer? What is going to happen if  the pipeline goes through Fort Good  Hope? Drugs, booze, family break up  and trouble."  Cassien Edgi  August 1975, Fort Good Hope NWT  "If they proceed with the MacKenzie  Valley Pipeline, all I can see is  corruption. Have you people ever  seen 7-year-olds, 6-year-olds, 5-  year-olds melting down an LP record  so they can get the alcohol out of  it to forget their misery? Have  you ever seen 7-year-olds melt down  polish and get alcohol out of it?  Have you seen that? Any of you oil  people, have you seen that? This  is true. This is basic grassroots  truth..."  Nelson Small Legs Jr.  May 1976, Calgary, Alberta  "Judge Berger, it was at that time  (1970 - as Fort Simpson boomed) that  my family experienced this biggest  social disaster.

My mother was not crazy  when she did all those things five .  years ago."  Betty Menicoche  September 1975, Fort Simpson NWT  "We want our children to have the  academic option open to them, so if  they wanted they could go on through  university or whatever; but we don't  want this at the cost of losing our  life, our culture, our traditions,  our language."  Robert Sharpe  July 1975, Old Crow, Yukon  Occasionally, children got up to  speak for themselves.  "I am against the pipeline. - My  mother's a trapper, she goes to  Crow Flats every year.  I go with  her every spring and would like  to do the same thing as her when  I grow up. That's why I'm against  the pipeline. Thank you."  Harvey Kassie - 11 yr.

That is the way we feel  about our land.  It is our flesh."  Georgine Tobac  August 1975, Fort Good Hope NWT  "Sometimes I can't see because of  frostbite but I have to get firewood for the woodburning stove, and  I set nets for the fish.

THE WITCH'S CAT  Helen Potrebenko  ESTABLISHMENT WOMEN'S LIBERATION  There has been a great deal of material written  about Women's Liberation in the last years. I have  concluded that if all I knew about Women's Liberation was what I read in the magazines and newspapers and saw on TV, I would not be a supporter.  . One job of the media is to take any social movement  which is actually or potentially disrupting to the  existing order and force it into a less disruptive mold.  a) Objectification by any other name is still  objectification  In a much more determined fashion than before,  women are presented as sex objects on tv, in movies,  in the proliferation of skin magaines, the "entertainment" in night clubs and beer parlors, men's conversations. A sop is thrown to women in the form of  objectification of men in skin magazines—published  by men. Instead of ceasing to objectify women,  capitalists are showing that men also can be turned  into objects, and this is supposed to constitute  equality.  The problem they tell us (earnestly and learnedly  and eruditely) isn't VD or pregnancy, the problem is  that some women can't achieve orgasm.  Thus, several of the women I talked to were  preoccupied with their orgasms primarily  because their husbands' sense of manhood  rested on it. Holding her head, one woman  said, "I rarely have climaxes. But if it didn't  bother my husband, it wouldn't bother me. I  keep trying to tell him that I know it's not his  fault, that he's a really good lover. I keep  telling him it's something the matter with me,  not with him. But it scares me because he  doesn't believe it, and I worry that he might  leave me for a woman who will have climaxes  for him." (Psychology Today, August, 1976.)  So there's all these articles about how to achieve  orgasm in 47 different positions. There are no articles  about how to achieve orgasm when you've been  degraded and humiliated, or how to feel sexy when  he's called you 47 different names, or how to be  and women's work is that most men's work pays  more. Women's work is, if anything, more essential  and more difficult than the work men do.  What's so romantic about coal mining? What's so  great about driving a bus, delivering mail, being a CPR  switchman? They pay more, that's what's so romantic.  Furthermore, I know from experience that men  are no fun to work with. With women, one discusses  politics, books, children, cooking, and other interesting topics. Men's conversations are limited to sex,  violence, sports, booze. Men are rotten to each other  due to the constant need for competition between  them. They ridicule each other for not quite being  able to fulfill the masculine role—and no man can. A  fat woman, for example, will get sympathy and advice  from other women, if they mention it at all; whereas a  fat man is told several times a day by his pals that he  is fat and ugly. He can't object—the worst thing a  man can be is a poor sport—can't ya take a joke,  fatso? Women in groups are considerate with each  other; men are competitive.  When the media gets really serious about Women's Liberation they pretend it is all about making a  Women's Liberation began in the late 1960s  along with all the other demands by various  oppressed peoples.  I don't believe the main push came from women  themselves, but that they were primarily reacting  to certain historical circumstances. These circumstances were the logical development of  capitalism—the devaluing of women's work and  the break up of the family.  Women's Liberation ought not to be diverted into  a change in sexual behaviour or be satisfied with  making room for a dozen more women in the  middle class.  The issue is not whether or not men are evil, nor  that there aren't enough women on the Boards of  multi-national corporations. The issue is that  women's work is valuable and necessary and  worthy of a decent wage. The issue is that people  ought to have some control over their own lives.  There is a barrage of writing and picturing about  "free" sex, the purpose of which is to present  Women's Liberation as if it were only a change in  sexual behaviour. "Freedom" means knowing more  about how to please men, and one of the ways to  please men now is to behave as if we had an  insatiable sex drive. Academics lecture about it,  doctors do studies. It may even be true that women  will do almost anything for sex. In the days when  women were supposed to just lie around and submit,  they did just that. When they were supposed to have  either vaginal or clitoral orgasms, they obediently  had one or the other. Now that women are to regard  sex as just a fun thing having nothing to do with  humanity or procreation, a surprising number of  women say they regard it that way.  For the purposes of rich men, being "liberated"  means that a woman has lost her sense of self-respect  and doesn't mind being used by a weary succession  of men in a weary succession of perversions.Nowhere is it suggested how these "free" women are to  raise their children. Promiscuity is "liberating", so is  wife-swapping (but they never call it husband-  swapping). So are some shoes, Tampax, vaginal  deodorant, panti-hose, prostitution. It appears that  women who have overcome their nausea at their  objectification shall be rewarded by being called  "liberated". They get other gifts as well—VD, abortion, dangerous methods of birth control, cervical  cancer.  It's not cool, though, to say that promiscuity  causes VD. Instead, there are all these VD control  programs encouraging people to think of VD as  nothing more than a minor embarrassment. Those of  us who still regard it as a disease are just not with it.  Then there's the matter of birth control. Over half  the methods available today fail. It only takes one  failure. A method can work fine for two years, or ten  years, and fail only once, and you're just as pregnant  as if there were no birth control available at all. It's  not cool to think like that. It's cool to act as if sex had  nothing whatsoever to do with pregnancy but was  just a fun, fun thing people do when they're feeling  jolly.  passionate when you know he's just slept with the  woman who is complaining of a yeast infection. But  that will come too.  Regardless of their own feelings about oral  sex, most middle-class women recognized it  as a widely practiced and acceptable behaviour. More often than not, they tended to  beel guilty about their own inhibitions, because they believed their constraint reflected  some inadequacy in their personal sexual  adjustment. (Psychology Today, August, 1976.)  There is now a growing body of literature about  masturbation. It's the latest thing—all women are  now supposed to masturbate. There is also the stuff  about the superiority of lesbian sexuality over the  rest of us. For those of us who don't think the sole  purpose of sex is orgasm, for those uncool persons  who want some kind of human communication,  well, it's just too bad.  There is no advice about celibacy. Admittedly,  celibacy is very difficult, but certainly no more  difficult than sex with either men or women nowadays.  b) Just a Housewife  An even more important role of the media is the  continued demeaning of women's work. Women, if  they are to be "liberated" are to strive for men's jobs.  A secretary is not "liberated"; a bus driver is. The  important effect being striven for is that women not  demand more money for their work—they are only to  strive for higher-paying men's jobs. So a few women  will get jobs as telephone repairmen; the remainder  will continue working near the minimum wage.  Many women fall for this tactic of dismissing  women's work as unimportant even though there is  nothing intrinsically wrong with housework, raising  children, typing, filing, waitressing, etc. What is  wrong with these jobs is the low pay, low status,  isolation, poor working conditions. But the media  acts as if these jobs were intrinsically demeaning and  that women must do men's jobs in order to get  "liberated". The only difference between men's work  bit more room in the middle class for women, and  some women's groups also take this attitude. Some of  this may be necessary in that women may still have to  prove that they are as good as men by this means. But  it has nothing to do with Women's Liberation and it  still leaves most women as poorly-paid members of  the working class.  The "liberated" woman is also presented as some  kind of superwoman, as for example, "How a Working  Mother Liberated Herself", in the November, 1974  issue of Chatelaine. This woman has a career, manages  a household, writes, and takes courses in her spare  time. Her idea of self-improvement is to drive herself  like an overpowered car. This image has several  advantages for those in power. First it guilts the rest  of us who can't do it (and none of us can). We're  supposed to think it's our own fault we can't be super-  women like her. Secondly, this woman makes it on  men's terms, in spite of the "handicap" of being a wife  and mother.  The same issue of Chatelaine reports a study done  in the U.S. in 1973 showed that women working  outside the home did more than 40hours a week in  the home as well. Women now spend about the same  amount of time doing housework as did women in  1924. And, in spite of all the articles to the contrary,  more than 80% of housework is done by women, even  when those women are holding paid jobs outside the  home.  Women are supposed to succeed in the men's  world on men's terms and still do the housework and  care for the children.  They are also supposed to acquire other masculine characteristics. Branching Out, a woman's  magazine from Edmonton, did a long criticism of  children's stories because the boys were presented as  aggressive and action-oriented whereas the girls were  passive. Nowhere was it suggested that being aggressive was a bad characteristic for boys or girls; instead,  the demand was that women be shown as aggressive  and doing men's occupations.  We are all supposed to be masculine now—and  masculine means aggressive, unloving, rigid, single-  minded. The former womanly virtues of love and The break-up  the economy.  of the family is due to the needs of  It has resulted in the most efficient industrial  labour force in the world.  gentleness are to be cast out as not even good enough  for women, just as women's jobs are now considered  unfit for either men or women.  No wonder so many women have rejected the  image. It is surprising indeed, to find that after the  media has done its job of chopping and distorting,  anybody fights for Women's Liberation any more.  SEXUAL FREEDOM IN PRACTICE  It's difficult to find even a one-night stand  nowadays. A few hours, if we're lucky. A baby, if we're  lucky, to bring up in some shabby basement suite.  Women appear to have a stronger sex drive than  men, and women are still able to love. Women are  taught to love and men are taught to hate. It preserves  the proper power relationship.  Are wives any better off? I got propositioned by  two jolly, fun-loving men from Tenace once. They  were both married. One admitted that yes, he probably wouldn't recognize his youngest son if he met  him accidentally on the street. And yes, his wife  complained about not getting enough sex. He  seemed to think that had no relevance to his  proposition.  He wasn't too happy about Women's Liberation,  however. His view was that it caused women to fall  into bed too easily. A man likes a challenge, he said.  Why not go moose hunting? I suggested.  In the very early part of my relationship with a  now long-gone lover, I remember that I saw him as a  huge, swollen slug. We were sitting around drunk and  suddenly I saw him as a slug. He had then swallowed  and digested two women and was leisurely preparing  to do in a third.  The image didn't last long and I can't find it again.  I can only see him now as a person in pain, unable to  love—sickened and dying of this inability. I would  continue to be his unpaid nurse/servant if he wanted  me, but he didn't. I ran out of what little money I could  give him. I had been sucked dry of the energy needed  to care for him. We were both sick and dying  creatures, but he could at least spit out hate and  venom, whereas I had only a terrible kind of resignation I would not have thought possible.  I loved him. Will I be forgiven?  He never once hit me. That's a big deal nowadays.  But ought one have loved such a weak man? Isn't that  some kind of masochism?  The sin wasn't in loving a weak man, but loving. I  needed him, see, in a world where the psychopath is  glorified. I loved him in a society where love is evil  and sharing, the act of a coward. Will I be forgiven?  There are other choices. Ms. magazine of September, 1975, revealed the secret of a good mistress.  Tranquillizers. There was a story about Trudy who not  only had men to sleep with, but all kinds of material  goods as well. So her friend Kay started taking tranquillizers too; then she found heroin was better and  she was also a great success as a mistress, until she  got some pure heroin and Trudy stumbled over her  body one morning. But Trudy kept on taking tranquillizers and was still successful until she went to the  hospital with a bleeding ulcer. Good whores don't get  sick, so the cunent man left her, but when she came  out, she kept on taking tranquillizers and found  others.  My doctor won't give me enough tranquillizers.  Alcohol is a violent drug and won't do at all. It's  masculine, whereas pacifying tranquillizers are just  the thing for femininity. You walk around half-asleep  and smiling; passive and satisfied-looking. That's  how they want you.  There are other solutions as well. I left him, I  heard a woman saying, just got up one Monday  morning and walked out.  Sure. We get like them. Make a virtue of abandonment. Anyone who minds will be locked up in a solitary  room and fed drugs and alcohol until they are no  longer capable of feeling anything. When they no  longer care if they are released or not, they will be  released. Then all of us, brothers and sisters together, can rejoice in our liberation.  Many of the women don't understand their  true role in the game. They will be used while  it is convenient and pleasurable for the  powerful men to use them, and then they will  be discarded, like used paper towels. There is  always an eager, fresh recruit to take their  place.  The men are often quite cynical about  the whole process. The availability of presentable female bodies is one of the "perks" of  power, like the chauffered limousine. For the  women, it is often not libido that drives them  into the arms of, say, a sixtyish chairman of a  House committee, but the chance to enter a  world to which the doors would otherwise be ■  bolted shut.  Usually the discarded mistress departs  quietly. (Vancouver Sun, September 1, 1976.)  The odd thing for me, is the fact that my relationships with men define my class position more clearly  and unchangeably than my jobs. I may do any kind of  work, but what fixes me in the lower working class  irrevocably and without any hope of mobility is my  inability to dress properly for an evening out, my lack  of fancy cooking knowledge and interior decorating,  my inability to cope at parties. Therefore, I will never  get to know the "right" people, never be treated as  anything but a whore by the men who condescend to  spend any time with me.  Maybe this is self-evident to others—to me, it  seems an odd and non-marxist conclusion. I ought to  have gone to modelling school instead of university.  My Honours B.A. will never offset my uneven fingernails. Prospective sex partners are much more careful  about that sort of thing than prospective employers.  So I'm stuck. I'm "too intelligent", too strong, for  men of my own class. Overeducated and arrogant, by  their terms. They would have to beat those intimidating characteristics out of me before they could  feel comfortable. I am not a proper woman, they tell  me, and would have to be taught a thing or two about  proper womanhood before they could take me into  their bed. And to men of other classes, even the upper  portions of the working class, I am only a lay, to be  used and discarded.  People tell us of the good old days of chivalry  when womanhood was really respected and  reverenced—when brave knight rode gaily  forth to die for his lady love. But in order to be  really loved and respected there was one hard  and fast condition laid down, to which all  women must conform— they must be beautiful, no getting out of that. They simply had to  have starry eyes and golden hair, or else black  as a raven's wing; theyhad to have pale, white,  and haughty brow, and laugh like a ripple of  magic. Then they were all right and armoured  knights would die for them quick as a wink!  The homely women were all witches,  dreadful witches, and they drowned them, on  public holidays, in the mill pond. (Angela  Rose, "We Are Women," 1973 OISE Women's  Kit.)-  BROWN-SKIN GIRL, STAY HOME AND MIND BABY.  With the increased availability of birth control,  women are held more than ever entirely responsible  for their pregnancies. Many men and some women  are convinced by this propaganda, ignoring the fact  that birth control methods now available are dangerous, cumbersome, or just don't work. Sex is  increasingly divorced in men's minds from bearing of  children.  Women who worry about pregnancy resulting  frome considered uncool, naive, unliberated. The  cool, "liberated" thing to do according to those in  control, is to sleep around as if sex didn't result in  pregnancy.  Do you have any children? the CBC interviewer  asked Dick Cavett.  Not that I know of, Dick Cavett replied, laughing.  Of course it's all a joke. Why should men worry  about such minor matters?  Mothers and children are what now constitute a  family. While many fathers still care, society in  general does not feel men are responsible, nor does  the community take any responsibility for the care of  small children.  In 1971, there were an estimated 338,000 single  parent families in Canada, of whom over 85% were  headed by women. Almost half these families had an  income of less than $4,000 if they were headed by  women. About 44% of these were classified as low  income; these families made up one-fifth of low  income families in Canada. (Issue. 6)  By other poverty figures, of the 6.65 million  children under 16 in Canada in 1971, 1.66 million  were poor. Of these 21.2% lived in two-parent families. Of the single-parent families, 69.1% were living  in poverty. (33.7% of single-parent families headed by  fathers were poor.)  Besides the effect of poor food and poor clothing  and inadequate housing, poor children don't go to  school as long as others. A study in Ontario showed  that while 71 % of dull children from well-off families  got through Grade 13, only 68% of brilliant children  from poor'families did the same. (Chatelaine , Feb.  1976).  Estimates in 1976 are that 44% of women over the  age of 15 work outside the home. (45.2% in B.C.)  (Statistic Canada).  A study of 105 women in Ontario revealed that  they would not ask for advice from their husbands if  they needed help with the children. These were •  women who thought that "loving a man and running  a home was the most important experience of their  lives". If they needed help, they would first ask their  doctor about it, then a teacher, then a counsellor,  with husbands being the fourth choice. Of the 105  husbands, four helped with the care of their first  baby.  In 1971, according to "Status of Day Care in  Canada" from the Health and Welfare Department, 1 -  1/4% of the children of working mothers were  enrolled in day care services. In 1973, this figure had  risen to 13/4% and in 1974, it was 2.51%. By 1975, the  figure was just under 3%. What an astonishing  increase! In less than two centuries, if such progress  continues, all the children under 15 of working  mothers will have day care services available! That, of  course, doesn't count the non-working mothers—  those who just stay home and cook and clean house,  wash clothes, iron, mend, nurse, and care for one or  more children.  In 1975, the same source estimated that 4.34% of  children under 3 of working mothers were in day  care. 17.22% of children aged 3 to 5 of working  mothers were in day care. 0.3% of children aged 6 to  15 of working mothers were in day care.  That leaves us with three choices. We can get  manied and have babies and take the consequences.  With increasing male parasitism, this means one  more dependent to look after and the possibility of  VD from his extra-marital affairs. Or it means partici-  . pation in some perverted notion of "togetherness"  where the woman submerges herself in whatever the  man is, since by definition, his needs and interests  are always more urgent and important.  Or we can stay childless and take the consequences, and those are perhaps the worst of all. Loveless and unloved, we become as cold and sterile as  the society that spawned us. IS IT THE FAULT OF WOMEN?  At first there were many different trends in  Women's Liberation. There were some women who  were for breaking up the last of the families, there  were those who acquiesced in the decision that  promiscuity was "liberating". There were those who  preached lesbianism as if lablling oneself as a purely  sexual thing was somehow different than someone  else labelling you as a purely sexual thing. This  minority is what is taken up by the media, and there  are now all these glossy books and magazines which  proclaim this is all there is to- women's liberation.  Sleep around, baby, and you'll be free. Free of family,  free of security, free of love. Just like men.  Erica Mann Jong made a big splash with Fear of  Flying. I read it with horror, searching for redeeming  features. She says some cliches aboufwomen's liberation—apart from that, the story goes somewhat as  follows: Isadora Wing who hates women and Germans and says she thinks Jews should be gassed,  goes on a trip to Europe with her husband. Although  she is rich and educated, she feels dissatisfied and is  obsessed with her genital organs. She is convinced  that what she needs most is a good fuck. She thinks  she has found it when someone assaults her at a conference. She leaves her husband and goes off with  this man who appeals to her because he is sadistic  and constantly insults her. He doesn't provide the  good lay because he is impotent and can only  perform before an audience. He drags her around  Europe, humiliating her thoroughly, then dumps her.  She doesn't object to any of this. At the end, she  decides her husband wasn't such a bad lay after all  and rushes off to find him.  Now isht that fun? It turns out the Playboy bunny  was a "liberated" woman all along.  Then there's Kate Millett. She was named as a  leader of Women's Liberation by the media, and  although she had no followers, she accepted the title.  In the book Flying, she tells us that it was all her  mother's fault. She hates her mother because her  mother was poor and complained about it. Her  who decide what books get published and how much  distribution they will get. A whole complex of men  including tv and newspaper owners decide which  books get wide publicity. Women who write good  books don't get them published. There is no money to  to made in Women's Liberation—there is only money  to be made in further objectification of men and  women.  Women's Liberation began in the late 1960s  along with all the other demands by various oppressed peoples. The militancy rose out of the protests  against the honifying war in Vietnam.  I don't believe the main push came from women  themselves, but that they were primarily reacting to  certain historical circumstances. These circumstances were the logical development of capitalism  —the devaluing of women's work and the break up of  the family. Ironically, Women's Liberation is now  presented as working for the very circumstances  which it arose to fight against.  After the Second World War, there was a big push  to send women back into the home, as described by  Betty Friedan in The Feminine Mystique. This was not  done, however, to prevent women from working  outside the home—it was to get them out of high-  paying jobs. Almost as many women continued  working outside the home; but as cheap labour, and  in growing numbers, as part-time labour. With the  growth of the service-producing industries, more and  more women were required as cheap labour. If  women were made to feel their primary duty was their  home, and their children would suffer incurable  diseases unless their mothers stayed home, then  women were available for cheap, part-time seasonal  employment instead of the higher-paying full-time  jobs with more fringe benefits. Department stores  save millions of dollars by hiring only part-time  labour, and even when these women end up working  the same number of hours as full-time workers, they  do not get the benefit of sick leave, pension plans,  paid holidays, overtime, and so on.  .. .if all I knew about Women's Liberation was  what I read in the magazines and newspapers  and saw on tv, I would not be a supporter.  mother didn't like being abandoned by her husband  with no money and two children. Kate wants to have  sexual relationships with all her female friends and  her husband, and the demented mother cannot understand that Kate should not only want to do this,  she should want to tell the world, and all in the name  of "honesty". In a rather insightful scene, Millett  describes that after a collective of women made a  movie and would not let Millett take all the credit for  it, she rolled on the floor crying.  Well, so what? If it was just another dirty book in  paperback, who would find it surprising? But Kate  Millett doing the stud thing (albeit not as successfully as if she were a man), cutting up all her friends,  says she is a revolutionary. The poor bewildered  mother is named a fascist.  Both Millett and Jong are stupid women who got  caught up in something they didn't understand and it  is difficult to get very upset with them. It is publishers  Since the Second World War, the number of farm  families in Canada has diminished to about 5% of the  population. Farm women had greater status and respectability in their communities than city women  do. The work of the farm woman was recognized as  necessary as that of her husband. Now they have had  to move to the city in a mass exodus.  The most important characteristic of post-war  Canada has been this lonely trek from farms to cities.  But there is not a mention of this phenomenon in any  part of the media; not even sociologists have considered it worthy of study. The only acknowledgment  of an uprooted population is ridicule and unemployment.  What it accomplishes for capitalism is mobility  and the availability of cheap labour. With women  reduced from wives to whores, men can more where-  ever they are sent and they can be isolated in camps  not so very different from concentration camps  except that the pay is better. They won't complain  about the lack of a family—they can get all the  whores they want. And when mothers are not supported by husbands, more of them are available for  cheap labour. They have to go out to work, and they  have to accept as little money as the employer wishes  to give because they haven't the power to ask for  more, or to refuse to work outside the home.  Over 60% of women in the work force are in what  are known as women's jobs. In clerical work, they  account for 70% of all clerical workers, 10% more than  10 years ago. In banks, public utilities, hospitals, and  other service industries, they were 56% ten years ago.  Now they are 60%. On the other hand, women are 13%  of all persons in managerial positions.  In 1972, women earned an average of $3243 a  year which was 43% of men's wages of $7633. In 1973,  Mothers and children are what now constitute a  family. While many fathers still care, society in  general does not feel men are responsible, nor  does the community take any responsibility for  the care of small children.  women earned $3591 per year or 43% of men's  average wages of $8310. ("Income Distributions by  Size in Canada," Statistics Canada. Catalogue No. 13-  206.) The figures available for 1974 so far indicate the  gap between men's and women's wages is increasing  ever so slightly. Yeah, we've come a long way.  In B.C. in 1974 there were about 2,000 casual farm  workers in the Lower Mainland. The majority were  Chinese and East Indian women who worked a ten to  fourteen hour day for $1.40 to $2.50 an hour.  As everyone knows, the "economy" would be  destroyed if women were paid decent wages. The  lawyer for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  argued that the fiscal fiber of the nation would be rent  if even one bank branch were allowed to unioinize.  The break-up of the family is due to the needs of  the economy. With fewer and fewer families able to  make a living on farms, men are more than ever, prey  to the needs of industry. There is construction, logging, mining, seasonal work like fishing, etc. Multinational corporations need office men who will go  anywhere in the country or in the world, depending  on the fluctuations of the market and the labour  supply. A class of ironworkers at BCIT were told they  would serve their three-year apprenticeship wherever  they were sent, even if this was some isolated camp.  "And I don't give a damn if you have families or not",  the instructor told them.  Men who were proper husbands and fathers  would not make these moves. Fathers and husbands  do not leave their families for a six-month stint on  constructions in northern Quebec. Fathers and husbands do not demand that their families move to  another province or another country at a month's  notice.  People are still complaining about the deficiencies of the nuclear family. The nuclear family  consisted of mother, father, children. No grandparents, aunts, uncles, old friends, neighbours. It is a  convenient arrangement for the demands of capitalism for a very mobile labour force. But it would be  best for them if men and women had no families at  all.   The homely women were all witches, dreadful  witches, and they drowned them, on public  holidays, in the mill pond.  The propaganda against fatherhood went along  with the campaign to send women home after the  war. Men were not to be bothered by the problems of  their wife and children. These was a mass of movies,  magazines, sundry articles in sundry newspapers  about how proper women were to behave. They were  to greet their husbands with their hair done and  dressed as if for a party, complete with deforming  girdle and shoes. They were not to tell the father what  the children had done that day, be it good or bad,  because the poor man had enough troubles of his  own. They were to feed and bed the children as  unobtrusively as possible while He drank a martini  and read the paper. They they were to bring on the  gourmet dinner and listen to His problems and be  understanding and sexy at the right time.  In other words, they were no longer a family  because a family, by definition, must share the joys  and woes of each member of it. Being married for  women meant only another dependent to look after.  Being a mother meant sole responsibility for  the children and taking the entire blame if something bad happened to them.  In legal terms, when a man and woman marry,  only one person continues to exist: the man.  In Colorado a study of battered women concluded every woman had a 50-50 chance of being  battered by men during her lifetime. (Vancouver Sun,  May 11, 1977). Sociologists and psychologists have  just begun to study the phenomenom, which they  call "family violence" when they mean husbands  beating up wives and children. Rape and wife-beating  seems to be a normal part of everyday life in the  cities. In Vancouver, 40 per cent of all murders are a  husband killing his wife.  When the learned men set about finding solutions to the problems, they come up with rather  bizarre solutions. A Vancouver psychologist named  Ian Percy has invented a board game designed to  make family members talk to each other. The problem, as Percy sees it, is lack of communication, and  the solution, as Percy sees it, is playing games. He  blames family dissension on labour unrest and the  fact that men and women usually hate their jobs. Men  take their dissatisfaction out on their wives and children; women retreat into feelings of worthless-  ness. "Men tend to be computers when they have  arguments, and put their feelings away", Percy is  quoted as saying. (Vancouver Sun, May 11, 1977.)  The problem seems to me to be too much communication, if anything. Men have always been able  to communicate very well about the kind of woman  they think they want, and women have to try to fit  the image or else. The latest is a thing called "male  menopause" during which the poor men are suffering  all the dissatisfactions of middle age, the main one of  which is the dissatisfaction with their wives.  Suddenly he wants a woman, not a wife and  mother. He wants sexual excitement, a vibrant, well-dressed assertive woman, like that  woman at the office who phones up men to  ask them out for a drink. He wants a woman  like that to pull him out of his own social  laziness and inertia. (Chatelaine,  February,  1977).  The wife is supposed to be kind and understanding and sympathetic during the poor man's  traumatic grappling with his internal self, even if he  decides to beat her, leave her, or kill her.  If she decides to leave him, she'll have to face  the fact that single or separated women in our  society have a dreadful time finding a decent  man. Competent, emotionally together women out-number men at least five to one.  Most men are little boys, emotional idiots.  They're inept, they don't know or care how a  woman feels, they run around at singles'  dances, pinching bottoms like grade-3 boys.  Their sexual egos are so fragile they can be  shattered by a falling soda cracker. (Chatelaine, February, 1977).  It has resulted in the most efficient industrial  labour force in the world. Nobody opposed the  incredible speed-up of work in 1950's and men  learned to work at the speed of machines.  In every year, more person-days are lost due to  industrial accidents than due to strikes. The rate of  accidents has increased in the last decade. In the hue  and cry about pollution, it is rarely mentioned that  the workers in the polluting plant are the first to  suffer injury to their health. It is all considered a  normal part of working conditions. Unless he is sick,  a real man does not complain that the work is too  hard for him.  To their credit, it should be noted that neither  men nor women responded to the banage of anti-  family propaganda in quite the appropriate manner.  After the war, day care centres had to be closed and  women fired outright to get them out of highpaying  jobs. And to this day there are men who mother their  children and share responsibility for looking after  their needs.  But the erosion of the family, while slow and  never quite successful, is nevertheless resulting in  the conect balance of available labour for the  capitalists. In 1971, 12% of children in Vancouver  lived with only one parent. This figure has udoub-  tedly grown larger since then but more recent data is  not available.  Alcohol helps. The lowest possible estimate still  makes about 10% of men in Vancouver alcoholics.  Alcohol makes men aggressive, inesponsible, intolerant—in other words, properly masculine.  There is a lot of propaganda around against  maniage, some of it presented as if it were coming  from the women's liberation movement. Maniage of  the kind the media 'considers ideal is definitely bad  for women so it isn't hard to turn women against it.  Not having a husband means one less dependent to  look after. Men were always supposed to be against  maniage—the old "ball and chain" bit. What kind of  sissy would actually admit to liking being manied;  what man who called himself a man would admit to  not wanting to sleep around?  But men have as much need for warmth, affection, love as women though they are not supposed to  admit it. A man who talked about his need for love  and cuddling in public a lot would likely lose his job  and/or be certified insane.  Men can only admit they need sex and through  sex are they supposed to get all these other human  needs fulfilled. This is, of course, totally impossible  so there are now all these men's magazines and open  line radio shows discussing the honors of impotence. If all of a man's normal human needs are to be  dependent on the rise of a relatively tiny and unimportant organ, then quite naturally, that organ is  going to fail its duty.  If, however, men are going to try to have all their  human needs fulfilled by sex, then there must be a lot  of sex objects around. Not people, not women-  objects. A larger proportion of women are to refuse  families so they will be available for objectification.  Topless, then nude, nightclubs sprang up all over,  most of them thinly disguised pimp joints. The number of magazines featuring women-as-things have increased phenomenally; movies featuring violence  and pretending this is sex have increased by incredible numbers. Even ordinary movies feature rape and  women-as-objects much more than they used to.  Women don't have the money to spend in nightclubs  and beer parlors so any objection they might have to  pimping is inelevent.  In many other ways, men and women live in different cultures because of the difference in their economic conditions. Seventy per cent of the bus passengers in Vancouver, for example, are women. Men  make more than twice as much money—they either  drive their own car or take a cab.  We are told that .women don't strive hard enough  for success as indeed, they don't. Men strive for  success; women are more concerned with survival.  Single mothers live in basement rooms with their  children and worry about food, clothing, decent  housing. Men spend more time drinking and worrying about impotence.  WHAT NEXT?  Women's Liberation then, is a holding action—  an attempt on the part of women not so much to  improve their conditions as to stop them from  deteriorating even further. Women's Liberation  ought not to be diverted into a change in sexual  behaviour or be satisfied with making room for a  dozen more women in the middle class. When  women are underpaid and made solely responsible  for the welfare of their children, the so-called "sexual  revolution" is only a variation on the age-old oppres-  5H55A &KILMNT      mKg A woHP&ZfUL  fTOPBHT/  tecz&AM  sion of women. Nor is the problem for the women's  movement to move women into men's jobs—if  women's jobs were paid decently, segregation would  disappear on it's own. The problem is to redefine  women's work as essential, important, and deserving  of a higher salary. The problem is to develop a  position of strength from which women can make  their demands known.  This is being attempted by several groups in Vancouver. AUCE (Association of University and College  Employees) was formed by the staff at UBC after  several organizing drives by a regular union failed.  The staff is 90% female and it was felt that a democratic  union would be interested in the women's issues  which regular unions consider unimportant.  Local No. 1 of AUCE was certified at UBC, Local  No. 2 at Notre Dame in Nelson, Local No. 3 at Simon  Fraser University, Local No. 4 in Prince George. However, AUCE has fallen upon bad days. When the AIB  ordered a rollback in Local No. 1 at UBC in 1976, the  union was unable to respond in any positive way.  Like most unions, AUCE is paralyzed by having to  demonsttate over and over again that it has the right  to exist.  The other group attempting to organize women in  Vancouver is SORWUC (Service, Office, and Retail  Worker's Union of Canada). This, unlike AUCE, was  not begun by a specific work group of feminists.  There are now about 150 members in 15 small  bargaining units in Local No. 1. These include a  number of social service groups, one legal office, one  restaurant, two neighbourhood pubs. Local No. 2 is  called the United Bank Workers and is in the process  of organizing all the bank workers in B.C. Membership in Local No'. 2 is close to 400.  In all cases, there are no professional organizers  and all the work is done by unpaid volunteers. The  staff write their own contracts and do their own bargaining. The more experienced advise the less experienced. AUCE and SORWUC members can now proudly say that not only can women organize themselves,  they are organizing themselves.  The issue is not whether or not men are evil, nor  that there aren't enough women on the Boards of  multi-national corporations. The issue is that women's work is valuable and necessary and worthy of a  decent wage. The issue is that people ought to have  some control over their own lives.  The process is slow and agonizing, but there is no  other way.  The problem of the disappearing family is an  equally difficult one. Many of the women's groups  are working for better child care but while they have  put in incredible amounts of work, the results are  barely noticeable.  I don't know what can be done about the  increasing sexual perversion. It goes along with alcoholism, drugs, and all these accompany the disintegration of the American empire as well as the needs of  an industrialized, capitalist society. The old society is  dying but the new one has not yet appeared. Times of  transition are always difficult and chaotic.  I would like to see mobs of irate women marching  downtown to destroy nude nightclubs, sex movie  houses, and other pimp joints.  I would like to see rape treated as the filthy, anti-  human crime that it is.  I would like to see fathers forced to contribute to  at least part of their children's support—both financial and emotional.  I think that single motherhood must now be  treated as a normal occunence rather than an aberration for which mother and child must suffer. As the  divorce rate spirals and as birth control becomes  more available, there are more and more mothers  raising children all by themselves.  It isn't as if the nuclear family was so great.  Mothers were imprisoned inside their houses and  were the property of their husbands. With increasing  drug and alcohol usage, wife-beating, far from disappearing, is only being held in check by the divorce  rate. The solution lies in going forward, not backward.  I would like to see the community as a whole take  more responsibility for the raising of children. Not  only day care is required but night care as well for  women working shifts and for women who want to go  out in the evening. It is now considered a criminal  activity for a mother to go dancing in the evening,  just as it is a crime for her to take a three-day holiday.  The immediate need is for more .child care  centres, including houses where children can be left  for several days or weeks at a time while the mother  restores her health or just takes a holiday.  Ideally, there should be children's houses in  every area of the city. Mothers could leave their  children there for as long as they liked, or as long as  the children wanted to stay. There would be a permanent trained staff and everybody in the neighbourhood would be encouraged to drop in at regular intervals. On my way to buy a paper, I could stop by and  read the children a bedtime story. I think that on the  whole, mothers would have their children at home  more often than at the children's house, but this  would vary with each situation.  Mothers would then have the time and opportunity for better jobs, education, travelling, even the  luxury of going to bed with an illness or a nervous  breakdown. A bout with the flu wouldn't mean  disaster as it now does for single mothers.  Such houses would be expensive but not nearly  as expensive as keeping abandoned mothers and  children on welfare, and the cost in health that the  enforced isolation entails for mother and child. At  this time, a beginning must be made in this direction.  Children belong to the community. This requires a  different philosophy than is now prevalent. Parents  would still want some control over the way their  children are treated. But already, most of the socialization of children is in the hands of the society and  only their physical well-being is the responsibility of  the mother.  I would also like to see the continued growth of  such unions as SORWUC. Only by organizing together into their own groups can women gain the  confidence and power to protect ourselves and our  children from a disintegrating society. The Berger Report  iCOn t.) continued from p. 10  "It is for this unborn child, Mr.  Berger, that my nation will stop  the pipeline. It is so that this  unborn child can know the freedom  of this land that I am willing to  lay down my life."  Chief Frank T'Seleie  August 1975, Fort Good Hope NWT  In his May 9, 1977 press conference,  Berger talked of the possibilities  of civil unrest in the North should  the pipeline be pushed through before the settlement of the native  landclaims. He told of the deep-  rooted feelings:  "People in the  North have made clear to me that  they have a cause that they believe  in."  The first tragedy has already taken  place.  Just over a year ago Nelson  Small Legs Jr., a southern Alberta  Native organizer gave his life to  draw attention to native rights.  Two days after testifying to the  Berger Inquiry he shot himself,  leaving behind a note protesting  government treatment of Indian people. He was not apart from his people in this action, but part of them.  To Justice Berger, Small Legs had  said:  "We will take up anything to defend  ourselves, our children, our wives,  our culture, our spirit..."  Prime Minister Trudeau stated:  "I  must say that when a man gives his  life for an objective, I must respect that and regard it as a very  serious matter indeed.  I will look  into it with all the seriousness  that it deserves." Nothing has been  heard.  Our Hon. Members  May 13, 1977 a debate was held in  the House of Commons.  Ed Broadbent,  leader of the NDP, had moved: "That  this House urges the government to  accept the principal recommendation  of the Berger report that no pipeline be built in the MacKenzie Valley for at least ten years."  In the course of the debate Broadbent pointed out that the gas and  oil industry, which told us in 1970  that we had enough gas to last us  392 years, and could therefore expect to export more gas, had argued  (for some strange reason) that we  would run out of has by 1978 when  exports were cut a year later. He  argued that predictions that we. are  in imminent danger of running out  of gas are wrong; and that recent  assessments indicate that we won't  need frontier gas until the mid  1990s.  Wally Firth, MP for the NWT who has  twice campaigned on a platform of  'no pipeline until landclaims are  settled', and won, said: "I suppose  that I am concerned about this because, in the past, the petroleum  industry has exhibited what could  fairly be called a credibility problem."  The vote to support the recommendation that no pipeline be built in  the MacKenzie Valley for at least  ten years was lost, 14 to 159 votes.  'I love the land. I will give my life for it.'  Possible Pipeline Routes  for Northern Gas  Has Ottawa Already Decided?  To date, the government has invested considerable money in the pipeline issue. Of the three studies  the Berger Inquiry itself has cost  3.2 million, with a further 1.74  million going to native, environmental, business groups and to northern municipalities to enable them  to testify.  Also, the Canadian Development Corporation has a 2 per cent share in  the Foothills consortium, which implies an expenditure of 140 million  dollars to date.  May 10, in the House of Commons, the  ministry of finance admitted that  Canadian Arctic Gas Pipeline Ltd.  had approached the government, as  yet informally, to request a government guarantee for overrun costs.  We saw a precedent for overrun costs  with James Bay, which was initially  to cost 900 million dollars and is  presently at 9 billion dollars. They  have also requested a guarantee re:  interruption of services, which  would imply a conflict of interest  between the Department of Finance  and the Department of the Environment should there ever be an environmental problem.  The question to be asked is whether  or not a decision has already been  taken.  In the course of the debate,  Alistair Gillespie, Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, stated,  "If there are delays in bringing  natural gas down from the north we  would be forsaking one of the options we have before us..."  The vast compendium of testimony  given to Judge Berger testifies to  the fact that any-pipeline, particularly one built within the next  few years, would have serious, generally undesired consequences for  the people of the North.  The pipeline would ensure gas supplies for  a finite and relatively short length  of time.  It would scar the northern  landscape for much longer and would  potentially disrupt both the way of  life and environment of the North.  "When you have polluted the  last  lake and have caught the last  fish and have cut down the last  tree,  it is too bad that then,  and only then,  will you realize  that you cannot eat all the  money you have in the bank. "  (Message once sent by an  Indian woman to the  leaders  of the European peoples.)  Save Coqualeetza  What is Coqualeetza?  It's a cultural/education centre for  the Upper Stalo people, the Native  Indian inhabitants of the area  roughly from Langley to Yale.  Although the idea of Coqualeetza is  almost ten years old, the project  has only really been operational  for three years.  Coqualeetza is run by the Stalo,  and operates many successful programs and courses for the Stalo,  other Native Indians, and for non-  Indians .  The culture, language, traditions  and history of the Stalo now rest  with the Elders of the 24 bands in  this area.  Coqualeetza provides a  way of preserving that heritage.  If Coqualeetza is not successful,  the Stalo way of life, art, songs,  and languages will be lost forever.  The funds for cultural/education  centres for Native Indians come from  the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.  Last year the grant  was $144,000. However, the federal  government has not committed itself  to support beyond September 30th.  Send letters demanding a long-term  funding formula, and a policy commitment from the cabinet.  Write  to: Minister of Indian and Northern  Affairs, Parliament Buildings, Ottawa , Canada. TURKEY AWARD  Despite very heavy competition,  this month's award goes to...  Anita Bryant, an ex-Miss America,  who has been successful in leading  a campaign to repeal legislation  in Dade County, Florida, which prohibited discrimination against gay  people.  "The laws of God and the cultural  values of man have been vindicated,"  exclaimed Anita Bryant, hugging her  husband and children.  "All America  and ail the world will hear, and  with God's continued help we will  prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation  which attempt to legitimize a life  style that is both perverse and  dangerous to the sanctity of the  family, dangerous to our children,  dangerous to our freedom of religion  and freedom of choice, dangerous to  our survival as 'one nation under  God'."  Canada Pension Plan  AMENDMENT TO CANADA PENSION PLAN  (Bill C-49)  This Bill would make provision for  the equal splitting of CPP pension  credits earned during a marriage of  at least three years duration, when  that marriage ends in divorce or  annulment.  Anotner provision would allow a parent who leaves the labour force to  raise child (ren) younger than seven  years of age, to leave out of the  calculations of their CPP benefits  any months of low or zero earnings,  where this would adversely alter  their CPP entitlements.  The Federal Government says it is  offering this as a method of recognizing the contribution to society  of spouses who work in the home.  However, the amendments acknowledge  such contribution only as it can be  tied to paid employment, either  tnrough a spouse's earnings or one's  own.  The homemaking spouse is still  unable to participate directly in  establishing the financial security  that labour brings to other members  of society, because she/he is seen  to exist only as part of the economic couple and therefore entitled  only to a split of the couple's  assets.  What's Been Done  A research team of six women, hired  by VSW under a Canada Works Grant,  started work June 13 to assess the  B.C. government's implementation of  those recommendations of the Royal  Commission on the Status of Women  falling within provincial jurisdiction. ,  '  The Royal Commission recommendations,  published in 1970, were guidelines  for removing the inequities which  have prevented women from assuming  an equal role in society.  A review  of implementation at the federal  level, entitled "What's Been Done?",  was published in 1974 by the Federal  Advisory Council on the Status of  Women, and the B.C. "What's Been  Done?" team will be publishing a  similar report. This will he the  first progress report for B.C., and  it will be used to press the government for full implementation of the  recommendations.  Some areas the project will be concerned with are volunteer work, protective legislation, women offenders,  household workers, child care, education, and matrimonial laws.  Any individuals or women's groups  having information about recent  legislative or policy changes in  these areas should contact the project at 736-3746.  Sisterhood mokjgs the newS  Sexual Orientation  On Friday, June 10th the B.C. Court  of Appeals ruled that the Vancouver  Sun had 'reasonable cause' to refuse an ad from the Gay Alliance  Toward Equality (GATE).  In doing so, they overturned a B.C.  Human Rights Board of Inquiry decision which had found that the Sun  violated the Human Rights Code, and  a B.C. Supreme Court ruling in  favour of GATE.  The Board had held  that the Sun had discriminated a-  gainst homosexuals without reasonable cause.  Because sexual orientation is not  included within the Human Rights  Code, B.C. courts can legally choosi  to deny basic human rights to one  section of the community.  Particularly disturbing is the definition by B.C. Court of Appeals  judge, Mr.Justice A.E.Branca, of  what constitutes 'reasonable cause'  While admitting that certain ±o#f  -  viduals at the Vancouver Sui  5>  have been biased, he claimed that  the bias was not in bad faith. "If  the bias was honestly entertained,  then there was not an unreasonable  bias," he said.  If a Nazi honestly entertains the  belief that murdering the Jews is  the right and proper thing to do,  is this a reasonable belief?  If  some people deny freedom of speech  to homosexuals because they sincerely subscribe to the many myths  and prejudices surrounding homosexuality, is this then a reasonable  bias?  Write to Labour Minister Alan Williams, and demand that the provincial legislation be strengthened.  Diana Ellis' New Job  The Women's Programme in Ottawa and  the Regional Oftice of Secretary of  State recently hired Diana Ellis  (formerly Bissell) as a Consultant  on Women's Issues for B.C. and tne  Yukon.  The position is a short-term  contract (June 77-March 31/78) and  has quite a different focus from  the previous women's consultant contracts filled in 1976-77 by Diana  (in no them B.C.) and Ruth Annis  (on Vancouver Island).  The major focus ot  the contract job  description is to "assess existing  strategies, programmes and resources  to encourage positive response by  institutions to status of women issues." Says Diana, "when you remove  the bureaucrateses from that, it  means that we have spent a lot of  time defining the barriers that exist in our society's institutions  (labour force, economic, legal, political, etc.) and perhaps it would  be a good idea to evaluate the effectiveness or our strategies to  date - find out what has or hasn't  worked and why - and move beyond  present stages. Part of my job this  year is to try and facilitate that  evaluation."  Although based in Vancouver, Diana  points out that she has a budget to  travel throughout B.C. and she'd like  to hear from women or groups interested in the topic of women and economic development, single industry  towns and institutional change., She  can be reached through her office  at home (11-1820 Bayswater, Vancouver  - 733-1058), or through the Secretary  of State office at 1525 West 8th  Avenue, Vancouver, 732-4111.  Women at the Top  Two women have joined the ranks of  the ministry of education's district  superintendents of schools, only the  second and third to do so.  Sue Granger of Williams Lake and  Dorothy Glass of Ottawa, formerly  of Campbell River, are among four  educators appointed to district  superintendencies effective July 1.  The first woman to hold the position  was Frances Fleming, appointed in  May 1973, and now an assistant superintendent with the ministry's  schools department.  Granger, 37, is the supervisor of  instruction for the Cariboo-Chilco-  tin school district and is an executive member of the B.C. Teacher's  Federation.  Glass, 45, is teaching in Ottawa  while on a one-year leave of absence from the Campbell River school  district where she is vice-principal  of the Campbell River Secondary  School.  Glass, a feminist, was a member of the  Task Force on the Status of Women in  Education in B.C., and a chair 75-76  of BCFW's Education Sub-Committee.  UNTH STAFF / P'PN'T I GlV£ HfKFKHj  k A r*£££ HANP K^TH \,OCt<SZ$ ? TORONTO  TORONTO - "We are seeinp, the renewal of a long, long struggle for the  right to abortion," Mary Stern,  president of the Canadian Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws  (CARAL), told about 300 demonstrators at Oueen's Park on May 28.  Commenting on the presence of about  fifty counterpickets from the so-  called right-to-life groups, Stern  warned the crowd:  "We must never forget that these  forces would take women back to the  days of lysol bottle and coat-hanger  abortions.  We. must never let that  happen."  The demonstration demanding the repeal of Canada's anti-abortion law  was organized by the May 28 Coalition for Abortion Rights.  The twenty-three organizations sponsoring  the coalition include Doctors Committee to Repeal the Abortion Law,  the Toronto Women's Bookstore,  Organized Working Women (OWW), the  Young Women's Christian Association  of Metropolitan Toronto, and CARAL.  Despite the sweltering heat, participants retained their high spirits as they marched along the long  route of the demonstration.  The  parade route passed four downtown  hospitals - all of which severely  restrict women's access to abortion.  Chanting was loudest and most sustained as the demonstrators passed  by Women's College Hospital, which  has recently closed its public gynecology clinic to abortion patients.  QUEBEC  At the Parti Quebecois convention,  it was not until the afternoon of  the last day that 1,500 delegates  got around to discussion of "a woman's  right to choose." The resolution proposed "removal from the Criminal Code  of all medical acts dealing with abortion..." The resolution passed, despite the unanimous opposition of the  PQ's national executive, and Rene Leves'  que, PQ leader, stated that "My government will not consider itself bound  by a position taken by the convention  on a subject as controversial as this  one."  (Labour Challenge info.)  ITALY  ROME, June 7.  The Italian senate  today defeated an abortion bill  which would have given the woman  the right to abortion on demand up  to 12 weeks.  This legislation  would have been the most progressive in western Europe, and years  ahead of Canada's.  (See December  Kinesis.)  The Vatican opposed the passing of  the Bill, with the Pope issuing  repeated stern warnings that abortion was the "killing of an unborn  child".  The conservative Christian Democrats  defeated the bill by a two-vote margin in the 315 member senate.  Women's groups are now seeking support for the abortion bill in a referendum next year. Despite the  oppressive presence in Italy of the  Catholic hierarchy, feminist groups  there marched 25,000 strong in support of abortion last year. They  mobilized effectively then and they  will mobilize again.  we MUST get visible  "We have to begin to get visible  again." This was the main conclusion to be drawn from a recent  talk given by Sherran Ridgley, a  national executive member of the  Canadian Association for the Repeal of the Abortion Laws (CARAL).  The following excerpts of her  speech are courtesy of Labour  Challenge:  "We are far from a free-choice  situation for childbearing in  Canada.  It's devastating. After  70 years of the women's movement,  from the suffragis£s,tto the present time - after all the time,  energy, and sacrifice that thousands of women have contributed -  we still have yet to win the most  basic of human rights, control of  our bodies.  And now even the  minimal gains we've made are under  attack.  Part of the problem in Canada...is  the facade of legalization and accessibility of abortion. However,  our rights in this matter are subject to the whims of a male-run  bureaucracy. In the last year,  there has been an incredible deterioration in what was already a  compromise situation.  For example, all the hospitals in  Toronto establish quotas On the  number of abortions they will do  per week. On no other medical procedure do such quotas exist. Can  you imagine a hospital turning away  someone with appredicitis on grounds  like, "Sorry, no appendectomy; you  are the eleventh this week."  As well, under the abortion law, a  woman who is refused an abortion does  not have to be given any reason. Nor  does she have any right to appeal.  We must understand that the deterioration in accessibility is linked to  the barrage of the compulsory pregnancy minority.  They have been mobilizing.  Their Mother's Day extravaganza of 4,000 in Ottawa is just one  example.  And many of us had some faith in the  Badgley report. The Badgley report,  however, is schizophrenic. Its findings are a damning indictment of Canada's abortion law, but it fudges on  the question of repealing this unjust,  unworkable law.  We have to realize how tenuous our  rights are. Under the present lav?,  rigid interpretation of the word  "health" could xjipe out what little  accessibility to abortion now exists.  As well, the irony should not be  lost that while women are. fighting  for the right to abortion, many Black,  Native and immigrant women are fighting against forced sterilizations.  We are fighting for the right of  every woman to have control over her  body."  LONDON  LONDON, ENGLAND.  Over 10,000 people  marched on May 14 in London to demand an end to the British anti-  abortion Benyon Bill, and for the  right of women to choose when and  if to have an abortion.  Sixty-five  busloads of marchers came from all  over the country. There was also  an international contingent with  women from Spain, Germany, France,  Chile and Belgium.  The main organizer of the action was the National  Abortion Campaign (NAC).  Speaking  on behalf of NAC, Rose Knight appealed for an even stronger show of  force in the streets over the next  few months,  (facts from Labour  Challenge)  U.S.  ABORTION IS A CLASS PRIVILEGE  The U.S.Supreme Court decided June  20 that the poor will not be able  to receive abortions. They ruled,  6-3, that states have no legal duty  to pay for abortions, and that public hospitals cannot be forced to  perform abortions for women who  want, but who cannot afford, them. Mary Lou Williams  Nicola Sumner  Mary Lou Williams was in town last  month playing the history of jazz  to an enthusiastic audience that  was depressingly low on feminists  considering what a rarity a woman  pianist, composer and arranger is  in the world of jazz.  Mary Lou's own career reflects this  history spanning swing to 'modern'  and links up with some of the most  famous bands of her time.  At the age of four, Mary Winn was  studying piano in Pittsburg.  She  went on the road at 15 with a popular vaudeville act of the 1920s.  In Kansas City, Mary Lou joined  the dance band of John Williams,  a saxophonist-clarinetist who she  was later to marry.  In 1928 the  pair joined Andy Kirk's "Clouds  of Joy". Mary Lou started out  writing arrangements for the band,  her first score being 'Messa Stomp'  During the Depression gigs played  as little as $50 a night for the  whole band.  The "Clouds of Joy"  were lucky, in 1936 they became  very popular with their version of  'Until the Real Thing Comes Along'.  Around this time Mary Lou also  arranged and composed for bands  including Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, Tommy Dorsey,  Glenn Grey, Duke Ellington and  others.  After 1942 Mary Lou led various  bands including an all-woman band  which played at Barney Josephson's  "Cafe Society" in New York. Mary  , Lou was a regular at the "Cafe  Society" for five years "before the  club was closed by the spectre of  McCarthyism in the 50s.  The band  consisted of Mary Lou on piano,  Mary Osborne on guitar, Majorie  Hyams on vibraharp, Bea Taylor on  bass and Bridget 0'Flynn on drums.  The 1945 recording is available on  Ori, Onyx 210.  Mary Lou played requests from the  audience including favourites such  as 'Summertime', 'Misty', and selections from 'Mary Lou's Mass'.  A great version of razaf and Waller's 'Honeysuckle Rose' demonstrated her command of the 'stride' style  of playing.  This style was popular  up to the 1940s. The pianist was  alone in front of the keyboard and  had to provide her own accompaniment,  a strong 4/4 beat with the left hand  while developing the melody with the  right.  A good jazz pianist, as Mary  Lou told her audience was judged by  the strength of her left hand playing - judged by this or any other  criteria, Mary Lou is really impres-'  sive.  CANER  WOMEN'S ECONOMIC RIGHTS DIVISION  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR B.C. WOMEN  . On May 20, 1977 Ms. Eileen Caner,  Director of the Women's Economic  Rights Division of the R.C. government, met with VSW to discuss the  socioeconomic status of women in  this province.  WER was established in 1^75 under  the Department of Economic Development by the NDP and miraculously  survived the new Socred government,  largely due, we believe, to the  protest by the Women's Rally for  Action, March 1976, over the abolition of the Provincial Status  of Women Co-ordinator's office.  Caner's division is mandated to assess DED plans for economic development in B.C. to ensure that they  offer women equal benefits. Northern  development is notorious otherwise  for lack of planning regarding women's employment, education, child  care and other social services.  In reviewing all DED policy, contracts and studies, WER is able to  amend the terms of reference, in  order to integrate the feminist  viewpoint, and reject material based  on sexist assumptions, before it  gets to cabinet for decision-making.  Because WER is limited to action  within the DED, it cannot directly  influence policy on women's issues  in other provincial ministries. That  is why we still need a central  coordinating body like a women's  ministry (despite its pitfalls),  within the provincial government.  WER is also breaking new ground and  setting precedents in the B.C. civil  service by implementing and monitoring an affirmative action plan in  the DED.  No other provincial ministry in this province has an affirmative action plan.  Given time we  hope to see Provincial Secretary  Grace McCarthy start one for the  entire B.C. government.  From her own experience on government hiring committees, Caner notes  that normally less than 5% of job  applicants in the DED are women but  with a little encouragement the number rapidly increases to 27%.  Still  she sees problems with affirmative  action plans.  "Affirmative action seems to help  women find non-traditional jobs,"  she notes.  "But it doesn't do much  for women in clerical jobs with no  career ladders."

It's a  strong film about strong people,  women in particular.  Harlan County, USA is about the  people who live in the coal country  of Southern Appalachia.  It is a  story about their slow murder at  the hands of the mine owners, politicians, gun thugs, corrupt union  leaders and the U.S. government.  But it is also a story of their resistance, their long and dangerous  struggles to organize for better  living conditions.  It is a film  about men whose lungs are so full  of coal dust they can hardly breathe,  men who need work but who chose to  strike, and it is a film about women  who begin to support the miners and  end up leading a thirteen month  strike full of violence and terror.  The film records their politization,  their ongoing fight for control over  their lives. Barbara Kopple is the  director of Harlan County.

PALESTINIAN WCMEIJ  continued from page 8  In Jordan, after the massacre of  Black September (in 197¬∞ when Hussein's army slaugntered thousands  of Palestinians in an effort to  crush PLO organizing there) the  union started working secretly in  Jordan too.  WHAT KIND OF SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES DID THE UNION HAVE DURING THE  PERIOD OF WAR IN LEBANON?  In 1973, with the first clashes between the Palestinian revolution  and the Lebanese army, we organized  a commission of the Palestinian  Women's Union and all the Lebanese  women's organizations which were  organized on a democratic basis.  We found that there were three  things that we needed.  One was  first aid for the injured people,  the second was ammunition and food  for the people, and the other thing  was information - this means the  political work - to gather the  women and speak about the aggression against the Palestinian revolution and the Lebanese people.  Many were enthusiastic and they  used to come and attend the meetings.  The work we did made a base  tor the work that started in 1975  (when the war was in full force).  And in 1975, we continued our work  with the Lebanese women.  We were very well organized. In  every part we knew how many wells  of water, how much food was needed,  the numbers of people staying there,  how many casualties, everything.  Palestinian soldier,   16 years old.  WHAT ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS THAT  PALESTINIAN WOMEN FACE THAT PREVENT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE  REVOLUTION?  The Palestinian woman, like all Arab  women, have the problem of traditions.  In spite of all she gives to  the revolution, she is still secondary in the family, and in Palestinian society.  And she leels the  revolution is not her main job. So  you have to transform the concept  of the woman in her own mind.  The  concept of her own role has to be  changed.  We want more women to know their  role through their tight.  We want  to make vaster and vaster the role  of the woman.  NDP Resolutions  Palestinian woman in a refugee camp.  HAS THE ROLE OF THE PALESTINIAN  WOMAN IN SOCIETY CHANGED OVER THE  YEARS DURING THE REVOLUTION?  Of course.  The problem is that  many changes have taken place in  Palestinian society.  Through migration, transferring from one  place to another, through the revolution, many families have changed  their place, their role.  But still  the Palestinian people can't accept  the idea of the changes. The society has changed, but their idea  about it has not.  They treat changes with old ideas  about them.  Even if a man and woman divorce and they are both convinced about the divorce, still they  treat themselves as if it's something shameful.  Of course there are big changes. We  are preparing a book abcvut the last  day of Tal al Za'atar.  We interviewed 100 women.  Many of the women  - one, who lost three sons in the  fighting, remembers like this: that  she lost three sons, but she speaks  more deeply about her daughter that  she lost. Her daughter was a member of the revolution.  She's proud  to say that.  This gives a hint of  the changes in her mind.  Those who participated in the armed  struggle - it's a symbol for the  Palestinian woman, in front of her  every day, in order to tell her,  'this is your role and you can do  everything'.  WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE A UNION  FOR WOMEN?  I will speak about women as a whole  and the Palestinian woman.  Ages  and ages lie between women and participation in the society, production  and politics,  xhe woman was in the  house. She didn't know more than  the borders of the house.  So if  you bring her and ask her to participate with the men, in the beginning it was difficult for her.  If  she wants to argue a political matter for the first time, and doesn't  know about the problem, she feels  she cannot participate and goes back  to the house.  There must be time a  and a special organization to train  women in order to participate.  I'm against a separate women's union.  But what can we do? This is reality.  We must face it. Cerlturie_. and centuries we have been away.  The Annual Provincial NDP Convention  took place at the University of British Columbia recently.  Resolutions put forward by the Women's  Rights Committee in order of priority  were:  1.-  that funds from the provincial  party and energies be spent on educating the NDP leadership and membership  on women's rights.  2. condemnation of cutbacks on women  by Socreds, as the NDP recognizes services to women are ESSENTIAL RIGHTS  and will provide permanent funding for  women's centres, rape relief centres  and childcare etc. when an NDP government is in power.  3. condemnation of the fate of women  in prisons and a call for the establishment of a provincial advisory council of  women recognized by the department of  the Attorney General to deal with issues  concerning women in prison.  4. amendment of existing policy to specifically include the B.C.government in  the call to implement Affirmative Action.  As well as these Women's Rights resolutions, others were passed pertaining to  women's rights in other policy areas.  In Economic Development: support for the  Women's Economic Rights Branch recommendations.  In Health: all provincial hospitals  be required to provide adequate  facilities for the treatment of all  rape victims, unconditionally.  In Labour: recognition of the right  of all workers to a safe and secure  job and the commitment of the B.C.  NDP to the development of programmes  leading to full employment and to  the full integration of women in  the productive sphere.  Emergency Resolutions: protesting the  denial of UIC benefits to pregnant  women.  As a result of protests from the Women's Committee, new rules of order  were distributed at the first Plenary Session with changes to eliminate  sexist language.

That's the battle to continue living  on this planet.  This is the issue which the Pacific  Life Community addresses.  It's  BANGOR SUMMER 1977.  Anti-nuclear  groups from all over the continent  will converge on Bangor, Washington  in a huge attempt to stall the construction of the Trident base there.  Bangor is only 100 miles south of  Vancouver.  The first Trident submarine crew arrives there this summer for training.  the ultimate  phallic symbol  What is Trident?  Trident is four  stories high and twice the length of  a football field.  It carries 408  independently targeted nuclear warheads, each with a blast 10 times as  strong as the one that annihilated  Hiroshima.  The anti-nuclear riiovement is growing  globally.  In West Germany over  25,000 people turned out in February, and in March, over 20,000 came  again to protest the proposed construction of a nuclear power plant  in Brockdorf.  protest  corporate greed  Meanwhile, in the U.S., this spring  saw a huge occupation by anti-nuclear  forces of the nuclear plant site near  Seabrook, New Hampshire.  In Bangor, three crucial actions are  planned: on July 4, on August 6-9  and August 14.  They will probably  entail mass trespass on federal land  by crossing the fence that surrounds  the base.

EXCHANGE  The Lower Mainland Women's Cultural  Exchange, nicknamed the "Exchange",  is a newly opened centre for Women's  Art, located at 217-B East 16th  Avenue in Vancouver.  The Exchange  has facilities for film showings,  workshops, live performances, and  visual art exhibitions.  Thus far the program has included  poetry readings by Vancouver poets  Helen Potrebenko and Nora Randall,  a concert by Californian Ruthie  Gorton, a theatre workshop with  Moira Mulholland, films by Peg  Campbell and Margo Dunn, and works  by less well known artists.  The  visual art exhibits since the Exchange's opening in April, have all  been by local women artists.  The Exchange is entirely self-supporting, and intends to survive on  local community support rather than  on government grants. The reasoning behind this is that the Exchange's policies stress the importance of stimulating local interest  in women's cultural activity.  It  is hoped that if the events and  exhibits are relevant they will receive local support. This is perhaps a somewhat idealistic standpoint in a city that notoriously  mistreats it artists.  The gallery space is delightfully  uncluttered, with freshly painted  white walls that put some of the  more established Vancouver Art  Galleries to shame. At the same  time, the scattering of lounging  furniture creates an atmosphere  which is comfortable and not in  the least sterile.  On exhibition from June 5-25 were  the works of Phyllis Green and  Marjorie Clark, two Vancouver artists with growing reputations and  several years of serious art making  and art related activities behind  them.  Phyllis Green is showing her small  ceramic sculptures.  They are minutely detailed and figurative,  and rely heavily on their literal  content. An aura of tongue in  cheek humour hangs over the works.  Marjorie Clark is showing a broad  cross-section of her work in acrylic paint, pastel and paper collage.  These works are carefully and precisely delineated abstract compositions, appealing on a purely sensual  level, and for their beauty of optical effects and delicacy of touch.  The obsessive quality that often  occurs in modern art, comes from  specialization in a certain theme,  type of image, or technique.  The  negative connotations of the obsession are over-ridden by the optimistic nature of the creative process.  Phyllis Green's obsession seems to  be with a recurring depiction of  veiled, submerged, or smothered figures.  The optimism of her work lies  in their humourous detail.  In  "Picnic", we see a minutely detailed  picnic tablecloth spread out on a  patch of grass.  The humour of the  work results from its predictability,  the-case with any good joke.  Folds  in the tablecloth and visible hands  and feet indicate (that a human figure  turn to page 23,  col.3  Culhane Trial  claire Culhane. member of the PRISONERS' RIGHTS GROUP, went to trial on  Thursday, June 9, charged with illegal trespass on penitentiary land. In  a judgment handed down June 14, Culhane was found guilty and fined $25.  When she refused to pay, Judge Shaw  ruled, "There will be no default."  It looks as if the law does not know  what to do about Culhane.  No doubt  they would like her to go away and  be a docile grandmother.  No doubt  they know she won't.  At the trial, Culhane charged the  Canadian Penitentiary Service, the  B.C. Penitentiary administration in  particular, with "gross mismanagement, unbelievable callousness and  a less than human attitude in its  dealings with prisoners, and friends  and families of prisoners."  An ex-member of the Citizens' Advisory Committee, Culhane spent 80  hours in the pen during the last hostage-taking incident, September 1976.  Culhane said, "I saw men condemned  to the most mindless form of treatment, robbed of their self-respect.  I saw so-called lawbreakers incarcerated in the most lawless institution  where neither Building, Health nor  Fire inspectors are permitted to  check and monitor premises. While  prisoners are expected to adjust to  society's rules, little or nothing  is said of the fact that these same  prisoners on release re-enter a society which cannot provide employment  for over one million of its inhabitants."  Culhane spoke also of the fact that  Bruce, Lucas and Wilson have been in  solitary since June 1975 - 716 continuous days as of June 9.  Two prisoners, Saumers and Shand, are still  in solitary following the September  1976 hostage-taking.  In addition,  she reported on how Justice Minister  Basford extradited Peltier on the  basis of an affidavit which did not  have the signing witness present for  cross-examination, as is customary  in law.  The witness, Myrtle Poor-  bear, has since publicly withdrawn  the affidavit.  "In Vietnam I witnessed people imprisoned in cages, napalmed and tortured... and I was helpless to do  anything about it except rage  against my own people who were making millions of dollars supplying  the U.S. war machine...As I turned  my concern to prisoners in my own  country I found them also in cages,  also treated like beasts. Here, in  my own country, I am not obliged to  accept atrocities.  I am not obliged  to watch silently while one class of  people inflict so much suffering on  another.  I shall continue to fight for the  restoration of visiting rights which  have been cancelled in every federal  penal institution in this province.  I would urge every one present to  join me in changing the present  structure so that men and women who  are today sitting in solitary confinement in Canadian prisons be  immediately returned to the company  of their fellows, so that every opportunity be provided to all prisoners to re-enter society as useful  members, at the earliest possible  date, so that there will be an end  to the terror which is destroying  so many prisoners...thrown into that  cesspool called the B.C. Penitentiary." How to Survive  on UIC  (No. 1 in a series)  With the jobless level in Canada  higher now than at any time since  the bad recession of the Fifties,  it's more, important than ever before to know what unemployment  insurance is, and how it works.  Yet, the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Appeal has said that  our unemployment laws are even  more difficult to comprehend than  most modern complicated statutes.  In this series of seven columns,  we want to look at the workings  and rules of the unemployment insurance scheme.  The idea of some kind of insurance  against the loss of a job is an  old one.  In the middle ages merchants and artisans banded together  in craft guilds against bad times  (which in the rough and tumble  middle ages were very bad indeed).  Switzerland experimented with a  form of unemployment insurance over  two centuries ago.  In Britain, there was a simple form  of help in time of unemployment,  based on contributions, as far back  as 1907.  This was also the case in  Canada.  This rudimentary system crumbled  in the disastrous years of the Great  Depression.  Thousands of jobless  Canadians were driven onto the public dole or into labour camps suffering hunger and humiliation. The  labour unions and some political  groups began to demand that an effective scheme to protect jobless  people be installed.  Finally, in 1941, to ensure the  cooperation of the labour movement  in the war effort, the Canadian  government of Mackenzie King put a  new unemployment insurance scheme  into effect.  This was revised in 1971 to include  sickness and maternity benefits. It  was also changed to include people  who earn more than $7000 a year, an  obvious necessity in an inflationary era.  It's a compulsory scheme,  since the government wanted to spEgad  costs over the largest possible number of people.  The scheme not only helps people  through periods of joblessness but  also keeps money circulating in the  economy, according to UIC information officer Tony Strachan.  This,  he says, didn't happen during the  Depression. #  At present about 150,000 British  Columbians are claiming unemployment  insurance benefits.  Unemployment insurance is not welt-  fare, not a guaranteed annual income,  not a savings account.  It is insurance. Like any other insurance you  must pay your premiums, x^hich are  deducted from your pay (about $13 a  month).  But you must also follow  the conditions of the policy.  Allan MacLean, a lawyer with the Vancouver Community Legal Assistance  Society, handles unemployment insurance cases.  He points out that, "it  is just as if you had fire insurance  on your house. The mere fact that  you paid the premiums for ten years  does not automatically allow you to  claim on the policy - one of the  pre-conditions of the policy would  be that you have a fire first!"  "And," adds UIC's Strachan, "you  can't collect on your fire insurance if you've been negligent with  a box of matches."  In other words, you must meet some  quite specific conditions to collect unemployment.insurance, aside  from having paid premiums. On the  other hand, if you do meet all the  conditions that money is yours by  right.  So, bearing in mind that unemployment insurance is, according to our  appeal court justice, "almost completely obscured by being buried in  detailed provisions", our next column will examine the basic rules and  regulations of the scheme.

That was  the recommendation of the .National  Advisory Committee on the Female  offender, chaired by Donna Clark  of Toronto, in its report to Solicitor General Francis Fox this  spring.  One possible alternative, not endorsed by the Committee is that  each province should assume responsibility for women, regardless  of length of sentence, and develop  its own facilities accordingly.  Presently, women serving sentences  of two years or more are sent to  the only federal temale institution in Canada, located at Kingston, Ontario.  Sentences under  two years are served in provincial institutions.  Responding to the Report, Douglas  Chinnery, Director of the Prison  for Women, stated: "I think that  the Committee started out with a  bias against the Prison for Women."  He added, "...a woman who has  strong family ties would be able,  in most cases, to stay in her home  province.  It's simply not true  that every woman here suffers.  Many have already broken with  their family when they come here."  "The point is that prison is a  bad alternative," says Lorraine  Berzins, coordinator for the follow-up of the Report oh the.  Female  Offender. "...We want to get away  from prisons as much as possible,  and the only way to do that is to  move close to the home community  where other alternatives can be  set in motion." Frustrated with  the present way of dealing with  inmates, Berzins observed, "We  are always saying that if we  only  had fewer men, we could really do  something. What ironyI Here we  have a small number of women and  instead of taking advantage of  the situation, we  use it as an excuse for not doing anything because  the number don't justify the resources." (Liaison)  Canada has the highest rate of imprisonment per capita in the western  world.  Women serving first time sentence -  50% (compared to men - 25%).  50% of their crimes are drug related;  1/3 detained are drug addicts.  Only about 1/3 have even been  "employed".  Rudy Di Felice/Philadelphia Bulletin Okanagan Women  Okanagan Women's Coalition  It appears that the OKWC will become  a reality, come September. That is,  we have submitted a grant proposal  to Secretary of State for the operation of a Coalition and await word  on its acceptance - probably by the  end of June.  The emphasis of the Coalition will  be on workshops, open to all members  of coalition groups, and will try to  cover as many areas as interest is  shown.  Some of the topics already  discussed are:  lobbying skills,  dealing with government officials,  skills workshops, communication  workshops, lesbian-feminist awareness, personal growth.  The latter  topic - and one which we feel very  important if we are to function in  the 'outside' world - might include  such techniques and approaches as  gestalt, sexuality and our bodies,  women and aging, women vs. women,  etc.  I have requested lists of  resource people from Vancouver Status of Women and the Women's Resource  Centre and will use this as a basis  for our discussion.  Additionally,  we seek ideas from individual members and will be on the lookout for  people who can share their skills  and experiences with us.  We feel that the coalition is a vehicle to help ourselves - those of  us who are working in the women's  movement - and that our primary concern is gaining knowledge and experience by sharing and learning from  other women. * For this reason, we are  not publicizing meetings or workshops  in the local press but want to keep  it to member groups.  The structure will include 2 reps  from each centre.  I have agreed to  serve on the Board as well as coordinate the coalition, but another  rep from Vernon is needed.  Meetings  will begin in September and every  4-6 weeks thereafter in rotating  locations.  Gas expenses will be  provided.

Women Against Rape  A Day of Protest Against Rape is  being organized, tentatively tor  Saturday, November 5th.  This action was initiated by Nanaimo Rape  Relief and now has support from  other women's groups, as well as  some funding from BCFW.  This ad  hoc group plans to put out a newsletter every month until the action  to publicize their action, gain  support and discuss specific aspects of sexism in society.  (See  page seven of this issue of Kinesis  for more details.)  BCFW and B.C. Tel.  women's groups are being encouraged  to inquire about or apply for a  separate category in the Yellow  Pages for Women's Groups.  Such  a request is especially effective  if your group has a business phone.  Also, Transition Houses can now obtain phone listings without addresses for the protection of residents.  WOMEN'S FILM FESTIVAL - A BCFW EVENT  Women in Focus members are working  on a BCFW Film Festival to be held  in October. They are booking and  reserving space in conjunction with  the Cinematheque and also hope to  have a workshop for women in order  that some political consciousness  and actions arise.  Costs for this event are high, but  it is expected that entrance fees  will cover thefti.  B'CFW is loaning  the project up to $1,000 to book  space and films, and cover other  costs. The balance must come from  loans and donations.  It was suggested that other women's groups be  approached by the BCFW regional rep.'  Any group of individual willing to  make a loan or a donation can contact Marion or Nicola at Women in  Focus at 872-2250.  Say No  to Fred Storaska  Rape Kelief and women in Focus members have brought up the problem of  Frederic StorasKa, who as a self-  called expert is a mucn-in-demand  speaker in the U.S. and has also put  out a book and film on rape, called  "How to Say 'Nc' to a Rapist and  Survive". His work is in wide use  by Vancouver-area police and schools.  Women who have worked on rape prevention and assistance, as well as  other feminists familiar with his  work, have disclaimed the usefulness  and safeness of his suggestions and  are appalled at his sexist orientation. There are several oriefs  about this problem and Mr. Storaska  has been denounced by the National  Rape Conference and is being sued bv  N.O.W.  BCFW has discussed possible actions  that could be taken to curtail the  use of this film.  Direct pressure  on tne various school boards, the  Public Education Media Centre which  supplies their materials, and the  police and RCMP were considered good  tactics.  BCFW Convention  The province-wide BCFW Convention is  now being planned for Thanksgiving  weekend, (Jctober 8, y, and 10th, to  be held at the Fraser Valley College  in Abbotsford.  Billeting will be  at the Davy Crockett Motel (!) This  Convention will stress Strategy  ratner than Policy.

Others  are being held throughout the province during the summer. Ombuds clinics  (from p.l) as they search for the  most appropriate solutions to their  problems.  Knowing that other women experience  the same process is some help.  Working through that process with  women in a similar position would  not only break down the sense of  isolation, but provide a wealth of  support and the benefit of collective wisdom.  This should reduce  the dependency that is only reinforced by traditional institutions  and enable the women to solve their  own problems.  In conjunction with these collective  problem-solving clinics, we plan to  run ongoing consciouness-raising  and assertiveness training programs.  VSW is going to need a great deal  of assistance to provide the necessary backup resources for these services.  We are willing to train facilitators  in these fields, provided they will  work with the clinics in the fall.  Women with peer counselling skills  or legal training are also needed to  work with the clinics.  Anyone wishing further information  should contact Susan Hoeppner or  Leslie McDonald at 736-3746.

CULTURAL EXCHANGE cont.from p. 20  is lying under the tablecloth.  The  entire setting is made of ceramic,  and glazed in realistic colour.  A  purple stain next to an overturned  wine bottle on the white tablecloth,  has a certain pathos.  Marjorie Clark is obsessed with the  colour pink.  It is however, through  her versatile handling that Ms. Clark  re-awakens the eye to the beauty of  this colour *  In the canvas "Pink  Emergence", a centrally placed white  area seems to glow in the varying  depths of pink that surround it. The  interesting effect is that the white  area seems to generate a pink halo.  Marjorie Clark's almost fanatical  use of pink, (every painting has  pink in it) allows her to explore  the beauty of colour for its own sake.  Given the woman-oriented nature of  the Exchange, the connection one  makes with feminism in viewing this  show ,is only natural.  On display  are three drawings in pastel, from  a large series completed by Ms.  Clark this year.  They are entitled  the "Amazon Series", and are themat-  ically related to the writings of  Ti Grace Atkinson, a well-known  radical American feminist.  Much of  Atkinson's theory is pretty dogmatic  yet it is certainly an interesting  source of inspiration for this group  of drawings.  In creating beautiful  abstract drawings with subtle pinks,  greys, corals and pale yellows, Ms.  Clark eases the political message  over, gently reminding the viewer  of the feminist cause.  The Amazon drawings are abstract  compositions in soft pastel, a medium traditionally used by portraitists because it is good for achieving the subtleties of skin tones.  The delicacy with which this medium  has to be used adds a curiously  fragile tension to Ms. Clark's  drawings.  They have a quality one  normally associates with the word  feminine.  Phyllis Green has made one very  witty work that has feminist overtones .  The work is a miniature  replica of a bathroom.  In the  bathtub, partially submerged in  water, is a female figure.  Only  a pair of plump breasts and knees  are visible above the water line.  The colours and patterning of the  ceramic glazes in this work are  playfully bright.  On the decorative green bathroom tiles are a  pair of outrageous pink slippers.  The bathwater is the turquoise of  a swimming pool, and the inevitable  breasts and knees are in the flesh  tone that one normally associates  with playboy cartoons of women.  The feminist overtones are obvious  in that the only parts the artist  has chosen to show are those parts  of the female anatomy that have  been most responsible for the female being considered a sex object.  Ms. Green might also be making an  oblique reference to the symbolism  of the bath in "The Edible Woman"  by Margaret Atwood.  by Maria Fitzgerald when  this is  ^*** hard  to swallow  ohone 736 3746  foroKIN€SISsub!  0»  I  2  D  n  O  c  %  $  a  •o o  if  o &  3  a t-< ^
