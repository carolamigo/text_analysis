 SrtSaALCQUitfWK*  September  Vancouver Status of Wonnen      2029W. Fourth Ave.     "736-3746-"7-B       Volume IV   No. 36  Are you a married woman who for reasons of either necessity or interest  works outside the home? You have no  doubt been told how important you  are to the labour force especially  if you are able to work part-time.  The Income Tax Department appreciates you as well. No wonder - your  husband pays 30 to 40% of your salary back to them if you earn more  than the $314 per year granted you  as his "dependent".  Many woman are under the impression  that they may earn around $1,200 a  year without affecting their husband's  tax.  I don't know where this myth  originated - the figure is $314 as  per revised 1974 TD1. Perhaps they  were thinking of their child who is  allowed to earn $1,178 before  affecting his father's tax. A teenager 16 to 21 years of age is allowed  $l,22o tax-free.  This anomaly  certainly demonstrates a married  woman's low status in the family  structure.  Others think that only those women  whose husbands earn $20-25,000 a  year are affected. Wrong again.  I'm sure you will agree that a man  earning $10,000 nowadays isn't  exactly living in the lap of  luxury. Yet the moment this man's  wife makes one dollar over the  $314 "allowance" he pays 30c of  each dollar she earns. The $15,000-  a-year man pays 38c, the $20,000-  a-year man pays 43c, and so on.  The following example will show how  a married man with two dependents  under 16 would pay one-third to  almost half of his wife's salary  (Rev. TD1 1974 including family  allowances).  If the wife earns over $1,806 the  percentage decreases somewhat and  she of course files her own return.  But her husband will then lose $478  for A, $580 for B, and $665 for C.  So when looking for a job she must  have a salary high enough to compensate for these losses.  Couples  have become accustomed to the marriage exemption and that is what  makes it so difficult for the wife  to justify returning to work.  The woman working full-time and  earning a good salary is in a better  position.  So is the couple where  both earn approximately the same  salaries. The group that suffers  the most is the one in which the  husband is making a certain salary  and the wife wants to supplement  the family income by earning a  little extra.  In the case of a  wife with no children earning an  additional $4,000, the net gain is  $3,079 for A, $2,981 for B and  Wife Earns    Hi  lsband's Exemptions  under $ 314  $3,358  650  3,022  950  2,722  1,250  2,422  If you have no children/your exemptions are: under $314 (3,198), $650  (2,862), $950 (2,562) and $1,250  (2,262).

Husband C is taxed  *Â«- 97?  Wifo r.   L.T.7..  2,905 for C.  (Single rate of  tax on $4,000 is $440). The wife  is earning the same amount in each  case but her take-home pay is  determined by her husband's salary.  I am not crusading against taxation;  it is a necessary evil. But I think  it is high time a system of fair  taxation for each individual was  devised based on earning power of  self, not spouse. During the last .  few years part-time work has been  actively promoted by governments,  employers, and women themselves.  It still lacks the fringe benefits  of full-time work but despite this,  it is a fairly good arrangement  for many women who also have  duties at home.  What then is the rationale behind  taxing this group earning between  $314 and say $4-5,000 so heavily?  Is their purpose in the labour  force to Supplement the government  coffers or to help their families  in these inflationary times?  Those of us who have a choice whether  to work outside the home or not  have only our egos to content with.  The knowledge that our husbands can  conceivably control our working lives  by refusing to pay part, of our  salaries out of their income tax  is not very comforting. Neither is  the fact that our government can  manipulate us through tax penalties  if too many of us dare to enter  the labour force at a time when it  is not desirable. But what of the  thousands of women who must of necessity work under these antiquated  laws? They must at times experience  a state of complete frustration. As usual the Americans are ahead  of us in recognizing and acting  upon these human rights issues.  An editorial in the March issue  of Glamour magazine describes the  work of an organization called  MATE (Married Americans for Tax  Equality) which has been formed to  lobby their government for a more,  equitable tax system.  It is  difficult to compare the two systems clause for clause as the  area of discrimination is different in the United States.  The  point is that they are actively  working to improve matters.  Our government assures us that they  are also working hard on a fairer  tax system.  We are not disputing  this nor are we denying that some  progress has been made in the  area of allowances for child care.  But the unique problems facing  women wishing to re-enter the.  labour force to supplement the  family income have been virtually  ignored, even though their existence has been acknowledged in  every major tax study from the .  Carter Commission to the Royal  Commission on the Status of  Women. Why? Is the subconscious  resistance of our tax experts so  strong that they cannot deal with  this problem, just as they cannot  perceive married women to be anything but mere "dependents".  Chapter 5 of the Royal Commission  Report dealt extensively with the  tax problems facing married women.  One of the main points on which they  received briefs read as follows :  "Raise the ceiling or eliminate the  reduction in a husband's personal  exemption with respect to a wife  who has income of over $250". The  only action on this to date has  been a generous increase to $314.  One of the good recommendations made  by the Commissioners was to reduce  the married status exemption by  one-third and thus make it possible  to be more generous toward the true  dependents, expecially children. **  Your initial reaction to this may  not be favourable but let us just  examine this marriage exemption and  see what it does (and doesn't) do  for us. A woman marries and decides  to work in the home for five years.  Her husband's tax saving amounts to  $500 a year for a total of $2,500.  After this period she decides to  re-enter the labour force.  Her  husband's salary has probably risen  and the marriage exemption could  now be $600.  If the wife works  for five years they repay $3,000  to the government.  Consider it as  a loan that is repaid with interest.  Full implementation of the above would  also provide a more equitable balance  between the single taxpayer and the  married taxpayer. More importantly,  it would still give recognition to  the woman who choses not to work outside the home while at the same time  not present an insurmountable barrier  should she change her mind.  I suppose it would be easy to put  all the blame on our politicians.  But we women - and I include myself  until just recently - must also share  the blame as long as we are content  to sit by and let our husbands do  such "masculine" things for us as  income tax, legal transactions, budgeting etc.  There is also no excuse  for not developing a sense of political  awareness.  However, enough lecturing. Here are  some positive steps you can take:  a) Analyze your own working situation.  If your net gain is next to nothing  quit and tell your employer why.  b) Enlist the help of your fellow  employees in preparing letters,  positions, etc. You will find  them extremely receptive.  c) Enlist the help of employers who  have been complaining about the  shortage of reliable workers.  If  they are sincere they may assist  you.  d) Get a booklet entitled "Taxation  of the Incomes of Married Women"  by Douglas G. Hartle from Information Canada.  I guarantee it will  be a real eye opener!  Send your letters, petitions, etc.  to Hon. John N. Turner, Minister of  Finance, under whose jurisdiction  this presently falls.  If at all  possible send copies to the new  Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women, Hon Marc Lalonde , so that  he is aware of our activities. A  copy to Dr. Katherine Cooke or anyone  else you think may be sympathetic  to our cause would also help.  It's  a little extra effort that may be  well worth it.  Let's all pull together and make  International Women's Year 1975 the  meaningful event it is supposed to  be.  Dorothy A. Holme  ** This appears to have been only  partially implemented.  If, for some reason, you are unable to write a letter yourself,  sign this one and send it to  Ottawa.  Hon. John N. Turner  Minister of Finance  Parliament Buildings  Ottawa, Ontario  Dear Mr. Turner:  The right to work of thousands of  low-income and part-time workers _  (mainly married women) is being  denied.  The present income tax  system, in spite of some good  changes in the area of child care,  is still strongly biased in  favour of the women who remain in  the home.  For the woman who  chooses to work, there is a dollar  for dollar erosion of the husband's  married status exemption once  her earnings  exceed $314.  In  these inflationary times, this  makes folly of a wife trying to  supplement the family income  while trying to maintain her home.  It is even more discriminatory  when one considers her children  can earn between $1,178 and  $1,220, depending on their ages,  without losing the same exemption.  This blatant difference of exemptions can only be viewed as a  method of society and the government encouraging women to remain  in the home instead of pursuing a  career of their choice.  The elimination of the married  status exemption when a wife earns-  over $1,806 is often an insurmountable barrier unless she can  work full-time and command a high  salary.  Raising the married statm  exemption is good for public relations but in reality every time  it is raised it constitutes a  further barrier to women wishing  to re-enter the labour force.  Women alone - not governments or  husbands - must determine whether  their place is in the home or in  the labour force.  Yours very truly,  lemoirs  of an ex-prom  que  A. K. Shulman  Men can do things as favors. Women's ,  kindness is a duty.  When women's yearnings and movements  are so confined, the only imprint  left for them to make is on themselves by becoming pretty.  Women who fall in love at first  sight are desperate.  =n  Women in this society are superfluous.  If they are pretty they  are only subject to another set of  assaults than if plain. Men make  fun of women for having breasts,  and for not having them.  It is considered crass for a woman  to improve herself trying to get  a better man who represents her  livelihood for the most part. Yet  a man trying to get a better job  is lauded.  If you turn a man down you are  considered a snob, chicken, cold,  all for the same thing. Whatever  you do, you are put down. If you  say yes, you are frowned upon.  Everytime someone says there is only  one way to handle a woman the different needs of each woman are dismissed.  Women are kept in their place by  veiled threats and insinuations.  Their dignities are undressed mentally and verbally.  When women are accomodated it is  often indifference passed off. women   in   real   estate  - Barbara Tomlin  A career in real estate is rigorous by anyone's standards. More than  a ten week licencing course is needed  to prepare someone for long hours in  office and car, days spent seeking  out and responding to a demanding  clientele, maintaining contacts,  remaining aware of the market situation.  In this industry of selling  and buying, of dealing with lots,  cottages, houses, shopping centres  and condominiums, women and men take,  numerically speaking, equal part. In  the area of commission earnings and  management positions, however, women  do not take equal part.  Social changes of the last decade  have been felt in real estate as  much as anywhere, and the outlook is  an optimistic one.  The imbalances  that do exist could be corrected with  relative ease.  Conversations with a  company production manager, a representative for the Vancouver Real  Estate Board and numerous women  realtors made this clear.  200,000 Canadian women in 1971 were  involved in the sector of finance,  insurance and real estate, that is,  51.9% of the total employed in that  area.1 Looking at real estate  offices in Vancouver (and excluding  the few that don't accept women, or  only allow a certain percentage -  ie. 20% of female staff) this particular figure is proven true.  Moving into the field of earnings,  though, discrepancies soon appear.  An earning sheet from one office  shows the top earning woman with  $ 2900 (average earning for year,  per month) and the top earning man  making $ 4200. A sampling of several  offices shows this same pattern,  without exception. Women are never  the top earners, coming closest at  third, and even then a poor third to  the leading man realtor (for example,  her $ 3200 to his $ 8000),. As income  is on a commission basis, unfair wage  practices do not provide an answer.  Looking at the state of management,  this unevenness again appears.  In  one particular large firm of forty  offices, only three are managed by  women. A spokesman for the Vancouver  Real Estate Board, although open and  encouraging about women in the industry, .revealed more disparities.  "Percentage-wise, there are less  women in the management field than  in the selling field." Relatively  few women choose to acquire their  brokerage or agent's licence.  This,.  attained by taking a four year  diploma course, is a prerequisite  for management and for sitting on  the agents division of the VREB.  There are a few women agents, women  do serve consistently on Board committees, and there is one female on  the eighteen member Board of Directors (Paula Verhoeven, President of  the Richmond-Delta Real Estate Divi  sion, the first woman so appointed),  but it's hardly a balance.  Somehow,  from an even start in real estate  sales licencing classes, there develops an unequal split of commission  earnings and an arrival at a largely  male-dominated management structure.  What could be some of the reasons  for this?  Unlike most men, women are not  entering the industry with an employment background.  Several mentioned  that they had never expected to be  earning a livelihood at this later  age.  One woman commented on how different it was for her eighteen year  old daughter today, who "expects to  have to make her own living."  The same production manager described  the individual female characters of  one office. As well as being enthusiastic and chivalrous, he made comment  on "sporadic working" "lack of drive",  referring to one woman as "too easily  distracted", another who "enjoys  frequent holidays", and finally a  girl who "uses her femininity and  actually says it's her best tool".  Many appear still to think of work  as basically the male arena.  For  this, and other more practical  reasons, they devote less time and  energy to their careers.  Almost all female realtors have  "one foot in the home". According  to management and themselves, these  working women often find themselves  responsible to a house, husband and  children, as well as to their jobs.  In work that requires long, irregular  hours, mobility and devotion, home-  making is rather incompatible. Most  men in real estate have traditionally  had the advantage of a wifely assistant, someone to act as a secretary,  to keep the home and social life  running smoothly.  Children, marketing  ideas for projects  and housework would rarely enter  into the career of a man and almost  always do in the career of a woman.  Along with their own socialized  attitudes, saleswomen have to deal  with the attitude of some clients.  As one woman realtor said, "Men  prefer to deal with men...they think  women are odd balls or kooks which  we are of course...", thus revealing  in both sexes, a pitiable but often  held view.  Initially, real estate saleswomen  differ from real estate salesmen in  their approach to the industry.  While interviewing these women, it  was found that most are in their  thirties and forties. They become  involved in business with little  previous experience.  Often, because  of divorce or widowhood, they have  been forced to take up a career.  As common as this, according to one  production manager, is the person  who picks up or dabbles in the work  to make extra money and stimulate an  otherwise routine housekeeping  existence.  They all make reference  in conversation to the freedom such  a job offers, mentioning the high  earning potential as another attraction.  Preference for salesmen is overwhelming  in the higher-priced property dealings, say management and realtors  alike. Women are hardly ever involved in the areas where 'big' money  is made industrial blocks, hotels,  apartment complexes.  Women sell land  and houses.  They are most successful  in well-to-do areas, where a "feminine  eye" and her knowledge of the home  are desired.  Attitudes of clients, of certain  individuals in management, of society  historically and of women themselves,  combined with a commitment to the  home structure, places limitations  on real estate saleswomen.  They are  not the equals of men, considering  income and management, chiefly due  to these circumstances.  The situation being so, what improvement can be sought, can be hoped  for, regarding women in real estate?  To begin with, younger, more career  oriented women are entering the business world.  There is greater self-  expectation and a growing public  acceptance of her.  In order to  further his changing state of affairs,  both men and women must come to a  fuller realization of female competency.  It's obvious that, holding the share  of real estate sales positions that  they do, women must see that they  have better management representation, and that they hold more than  one seat on the Vancouver Real  Estate Board's Board of Directors.  As with everything, it's crucial for  the women within the structure to  work toward a change in that structure, until improvement is seen.  from B.C. women to present at the  conference.

I picked up  Vol. 1 No. 25 (Aug. 15 to Aug. 21).  Actually, I must confess that I surreptitiously enjoy this sensational  little tabloid in the same manner  which I occasionally enjoy Cosmopolitan or the odd movie magazine.  Definitely, however, I will never go  for Dick MacLean's journalistic  treatment of women. An example of  MacLean's style occurs in his column  boldly headed DICK MACLEAN:  "Thus  his eyes were rivetted on a moist  young gidget serving her tenderloin."  MacLean's point is well taken that  the waitress wrote a receipt for  $ 30.00 when "one of Vancouver's most  eligible bachelors" paid only $ 22.35  for a meal.  But must the waitress  be described like an item on the  A more meritable publication is  Vancouver  Leisure Magazine.  Editor,  Mac Parry, formerly edited the  defunct B.C.

One great relief  in the new format of the magazine  (formerly Dick MacLean's Guide) is  the absence of "Girls of Vancouver."  Remember the glossy 6" x 6" sexy sister pictures with captions such as  "Dora likes photography"? I feel that  both Diana Ricardo's "Shopping Around"  and Jennifer Pike's "It's your Nickel",  a consumer column could be improved  upon.

Margaret's role in the recent election  campaign and labels her, "a perfectly  preserved flowerchild".  The fact  that Margaret Trudeau reads Blake  and Krishnamurti should not result  in the "flowerchild" label which is  an out-of-date cliche anyway.  Callwood also notes that Margaret  remarked that the campaign had taken  five years off her life, "It's like  Margaret Atwood's Surfacing, I feel  that I've been underground a long  time." Any "flowerchild" who can  wade through the first 100 pages of  Surfacing to reach the gritty central  chapters must be a mature one.  I  do not believe that a concerned,  loving-hearted individual of 25 or  50 fighting against the media's  tendency to type and to package,  speaking as Callwood acknowledges,  "in the open, unguarded style of her  plastic CU7 is in the shape of the  numeral 7.

In the August Esquire, there is a  fascinating and witty article "The  Almighty dare Boothe Luce" by Helen  Lawrenson.

Read this  article and wonder about this woman  who Lawrenson says "perfected a  technique for making all other women  in any gathering feel eligible for  the booby prize."  The new magazine WomenSports is well  worth the $ 1.00 you'll pay for it.  From the appealing cover picture of  the tough little redheaded girl with  the baseball mitt over her head to  the great variety of articles, it's  a quality production.  The articles  range from "Joan Joyce: Star Pitcher"  to "Women's Crew in Boston" (rowing)  to a pleasant reversal of a  Cosmopolitan-type title, "How to Pick  Up Men (and throw them against the  wall)".  The article deals with "the  maidenly art of beating the hell out  of a rapist".  "The Girls of Summer"  deals with the legal issue of girls  playing on Little League baseball  teams.  The magazine's purpose as  stated by writer Rosalie Wright on  the last page is "To show us all  how to compete, to survive, to excel"  and it does just that. P.S.

Cathcart is  described as a writer "close to the  royal family".  There is an old adage  "where there is smoke, there is fire"  and journalists are very good at  noting the smoke, when they cannot  write about the fire.  I do not think  that Canadian women need to be fed  this "their-marriage-is-really-a-bed-  of-roses" pap.  It comes to me from  'an English photographer who worked  as an assistant to Armstrong-Jones  and a delightful old Saltspring  Islander who used to move the royal  family that Cathcart's view of the  marriage is somewhat biased.

But enough of my personal  tangent, Callwood presents the first  really thoughtful examination of  Margaret Trudeau and it is also a  fair one.

It is hard to believe  this one-dimensional 25-year-old who  sits so close to the political helm  of the nation has yet to offer any  substantial comments on current political issues, particularly those  concerning women.

The teaching methods have  been varied perhaps, but what  about the people? How is_ the  female student faring in a world  in which the opinion of women has  made headway and headlines? And  perhaps more important; what do  these young women think of themselves and each other?  High school is still, yes, still,  that wonderful place where the  fountain of youth explodes into mass  transfiguration.  The ages of  students range from about 12-18, that  age when friendship is very important.  Friendship in high school is  largely made up by cliques.  These  tight groups often have ideas or  feelings that represent the entire  group. The individual, therefore,  gets a rare chance to voice what  may be her true and honest opinion,  for fear of loss of friends.  For  the individual's different ideas,  whether they be a viewpoint on the  world or a view on women; these may  be hidden deep because school is  that place in which if you are  different, you may not end up with  many friends.  Therefore what we  probably hear, are the general,  mass-produced ideas which stand for  no one but a small majority (probably  male!)  Many high school girls are doing  what girls have done for years:  cooking, sewing, childcare, and  secretarial courses.  Some counsellors urge girls to attempt courses  which have newly opened up to them:  ($$/  ~^^D\  " i)  /   !  rrz=â-  ~^^~ â â                   _^^^*Â»*Â»***%j-  woodwork, electricity, drafting,  automotive.  Girls do not shy away  from math and the sciences.  I believe that time has passed, in  which the female "brains" were  passed up as social "duds". Many  girls plan careers in law, science  or business as they near the completion of high school.  Some girls  have dreams too, but these are romantic notions of Mr. One-and-Only  rescuing her from high school.  They'll live happily ever after  while she looks after jolly, plump,  laughing babies!!  Speaking of  babies, some girls do practice birth-  control.  Whether they need it or not,  it holds a mystical status for some  other girls.  At my school, the head of the  student's council was entitled the  chairman, until someone realized  the discrepancy in that there were  girls as well as boys on the council.  Thus, now we have a chairperson.  This incident may not be important  in itself, but it shows that before  large changes are accomplished, one  must start with the small.  As for discussion directly in  the classroom, the main topic may  not be carried by either a male or  a female, probably only the more  voluble . (which may be of either  sex).  The tone of the class, in  terms of whether female students  are being discriminated against,  is due largely by the teacher.  Many girls speak out however, if  something happening is against  their way of thinking.  Young people today, both male  and female are bombarded with a  multitude of ideas as to what they  should be, and how they should act.  The female student is bewildered  at times, when parental morals  begin to conflict with the rapidly  changing times. A woman attempts  to be herself, only to find she  isn't sure who that is. Women must  be aware of the world, in that she  must be willing to take a spot in  it, starting. . .in high school.'.'  Dear Editor:  I have been having trouble  in school with my principal, Mr.  Slark.  True, he can be a very  nice and understanding man but  there is just one thing that  puts him down.  In our school  boys are allowed to wear run  down and faded jeans and the  teachers wouldn't say a word.  On the other hand girls are  not allowed to wear jeans  never mind" clean and ironed.  Probably nothing will  come of this but I just wanted  to give you an idea of what's  eoine on in some schools.  Name withheld  girl's   lib  Strength isn't everything.  Just because boys think there  so strong doesn't mean that  girls can't do anything. We  should be allowed to do anything they do.  Just because  boys are stronger doesn't mean  they're smarter than girls!  We're just as smart and fast  as they are doing work or anything else.  Why aren't girls allowed  to play baseball on a team?  We can run just as fast and  hit balls just as far as boys.  Why can't girls play football  on a well known team.  Because  boys think we'll break every  bone in our body.  Girls should be allowed  to do everything boys do.  Anne-Marie Holme, age 10  :  parent    pressure  In the last two years there have  been a few encouraging signs that the  professional educators are at least  willing to explore some of the ideas  of the women's movement.  In 1973,  Linda Shuto was hired by the B.C.  Teachers Federation to look into the  position of women in education.  In  May of this year, Sheila Purdy, Gene  Errington and Betty Ann Buss were  chosen to be on a Provincial committee to examine sexual discrimination  in textbooks.  It is not very likely  however, that the traditional way of  dealing with children will change  much unless the parents of these  children are also involved in the  process. We are the ones who must  prod the educators into changing the  system which programmes our children  into sex roles. Now is the time for  parents to become active in this  struggle.  If we are to rid the educational system of sex-role stereotyping, if we are to insure equal  educational opportunity for girls,  then we must join together.  If you  are interested in being a part of a  parents pressure group, contact  Nadine at the VSW office -736-3746 People must know the past, to  understand the present, and to face  the future," Nellie McClung told her  followers in 1915 and like many of  Nellie McClung's statements, it is  as appropriate now as it was then.  Three links with our past that we  can know.and appreciate are Nellie  McClung, Emily Murphy and Grace  Maclnnis.  Nellie Letitia Mooney McClung was  born in 1873 in Ontario and moved to  Manitoba as a child where by 1907  she was active in the Women's  Christian Temperance Union and the  fight for women's suffrage (the two  causes were practically inseparable  on the Prairies.) A dedicated and  tireless crusader for women's rights  "The Holy Terror" saw no reason why  the battle should be a dull one.  Her quick wit and sharp tongue drew  packed houses of supporters and  opponents alike to hear "Windy  Nellie" proclaim, "It is true that  a woman has to be twice as good as  a man to succeed in public life.  Fortunately this is not difficult,"  or "A woman's place is in the home -  and a man's too - but it is not  necessary to be there twenty-four  hours a day, every day in the year.'  Her performance as premier in the  Woman's Parliament, staged by the  Women's Civic League in Winnipeg  the evening after Premier Roblin had  rejected the petition of their delegation, was hailed as a masterpiece.  The laughter that her satirical  paraphrasing of the Premier's words  engendered had a devasting effect or  the credibility and dignity of the  government and was credited by many  as a factor in its downfall the  following year.  It wasn't wise to  mess with Nellie! Her motto was  "Never retract, never explain, never  apologize - get the thing done and  let them howl." She was tough and  she was spirited and she was effective. And she was incredibly busy!  She taught school for awhile, crisscrossed North America as a lecturer  for women's rights, was instrumental  in winning the vote for women in  Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan,  served in the Alberta Legislature  from 1921 to 1926, was the first  woman to be a member of the Canada  Methodist delegation at the Ecumenical Conference in London, England,  was the sole woman appointed to the  Dominion War Council in 1915, and  was the sole Canadian delegate to  the League of Nations in Geneva in  1938.  She was the first woman member of the Board of Governors of the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,  was one of the five representative  women of Alberta who were successful  in having women included in the  definition of "persons" in the  British North America Act, wrote  18 books, and raised five children.  She was irrepressible, carrying her  battles forward with unfailing humour  and optimism.  One of Nellie McClung's co-representatives in the Persons* Case of 1929  and tfce person most responsible for  its success, was Emily Cowan  Ferguson Murphy, born in 1868 in  Ontario.  In 1904 she moved to  Alberta where she played a prominent  role in getting the franchise for  women.  In 1916, she was the first  woman in the British Empire to be  appointed as a police magistrate  (for Edmonton and later for Alberta),  and served in this capacity until  THQEE PIONEER  1931. On her first day in court,  a well-known criminal lawyer in  Edmonton objected to her jurisdiction  as a magistrate on the grounds that  she was not "a person" within the  meaning of Section 24 of the Statutes  of the British North America Act.  Judge Murphy listened to his argument  and had his objections noted and the  hearing of the case proceeded.  On  every subsequent case the lawyer  repeated his objection and Judge  Murphy had it duly noted although,  she confessed to a friend, it became  tedious after awhile.  Eventually  the lawyer tired of voicing his  objection but Emily Murphy did not  forget.  For thirteen years she led  the fight to have women recognized  as persons according to the BNA Act  and so be eligible to sit in the  Canadian Senate.  She may have had  a weakness for yards of gaudy beads,  feathered boas, and hats with drooping ostrich feathers and was nicknamed Tubbie by her family, but she  was known as a fair, strict judge,  and she proved to be an indefatigâ  ible opponent of injustice. And to  her it was unjust that women could  not be members of the Senate. Besides  that, there was the very idea that  women were not defined as persons in  the eyes of the law! Where did that  leave them anyway? When their case  was defeated by- the Supreme Court of  Canada, Emily Murphy rallied her  four co-defendents and carried the  appeal to His Majesty's Privy CounciL  in Great Britain, which on October  18, 1929, decided that "the word  'persons' includes members of the  male and female sex." Make a note of  that day - that's the day that we  were officially defined as persons.  Although her own hope of becoming  the first woman Senator was not  realized, a woman was appointed to  the Senate in 1930, a move that  would have been impossible before  Emily Murphy's work.  Emily Murphy played a prominent part  in philanthropic and humanitarian  affairs in Alberta, wrote several  lively books on life in the Canadian  West under the name of Janey Canuck,  and was a tireless advocate of  extended rights and protection for  women.  She saw no limits to the  potential in women and once stated  that "the only truly contented  women are those who have both a  home and a profession." She held  that "the distinguishing mark of a  really fine woman is loyalty to and  faith in her sex." This principle  was reflected in her work and in her  personal relationships and I think  that this may be the area where we  can feel the strongest emotional  kinship with women like Emily Murphy  and Nellie McClung. After the long  dry years of regarding other women  as less capable and less interesting .  than men, and as rivals for the  attention of those men, women are  shedding their lack of confidence  and regaining a feeling of self-  worth and turning to each other with  trust and respect.  The term "sisterhood" that is heard so often today  is a desire for the feeling of mutual  respect and affection and sharing  that prompted Nellie McClung to write  to Emily Murphy, after an association  of many years, expressing "a great  thankfulness that we have met, and  known, and loved each other."  Winona Grace Maclnnis followed the  trail blazed by women like Nellie  McClung and Emily Murphy - taking an  active part in politics and public  life and pressing for reforms needed  to better the lot of women. Not  only has she been around Parliament  longer than any other MP, coming to  Ottawa in 1922 when her father J.S.  Woodsworth, a crusading Methodist  minister and pacifist, was elected  one of three Labour MPs, but between  1968 and 1972 she was the lone woman  in the House of Commons.  In 1932, after years of tireless  speaking and organizing in nine  provinces, she helped her father  and her husband, Angus Maclnnis,  found the Co-operative Commonwealth  Federation, which years later joined  with labour unions to become the  New Democrat Party.  She served as  honorary secretary to her father who  was President of the party and later  as secretary to the CCF caucus and  in 1941, now living in Vancouver, she  began a four year term as a member  of the B.C. Legislature and in this  capacity insisted that women in the  labour market be able to keep their  wartime jobs and be given equal  opportunities for training, employment and advancement. Unfortunately,  it was a lone voice in an emotional  climate that saw women returning  to their "place in the home" to  emulate the models devised for  them by women's magazines and  Hollywood movies.  In 1965 Angus Maclnnis died, and  Grace won the federal Vancouver-  Kingsway riding which he had held  for twenty seven years, and which  she has held until this year when  she retired.  In her maiden speech  in the House of Commons she continued her tradition of pressing  for protective measures for women  by advocating salaries for women  who make motherhood a fulltime  career.  Throughout her career she  has been associated with social  causes such as more consumer protection legislation, the fight to  Murphy  McClung  Mac Innis  get abortion out of the Criminal  Code, the right to maternity leave,  equal survivor benefits under  Canadian Pension Plan, new measures to support family planning  and use of contraception, and low-  income problems such as housing and  pensions - issues she describes as  "pioneer work but practical work."  In 1972 she got the government to  accept her suggestion that being a  housewife constitutes having been  in the work force for the one year  required to become eligible for  manpower programs under the Adult  Occupational Training Act, thereby  making economic independence more  possible for many women.  Grace Maclnnis's father once stated  as a rejection of mindless adherence  to yesterdays's wisdom and standards,  "What was good enough for my father  is NOT good enough for me." Grace  Maclnnis has done a great deal towards seeing that we do not have to  settle for what was 'good enough'  for our mothers or 'the way it has  always been.'  Recongnlzing this contribution, the  Paris magazine Marie-Claire, in 1971,  named Grace Maclnnis one of the fifty  most important women of the world.  The women were selected by the magazine's correspondents oraries and  advancement of women's rights by  success in a field traditionally  dominated by men.  Grace Maclnnis  was the only Canadian chosen and  was in company with Golda Meir,  Indira Ghandi and Margaret Mead.  Emily Murphy died in 1933 of diabetes, having retired as judge  two years earlier to devote some  time to her other works which included a 60,000 word manuscript,  "Pruning the Family Tree", demanding proper education and information on birth control, and a  series of articles denouncing publ  apathy to the problem of venereal  disease - pretty shocking stuff  in those days.  Nellie McClung died in 1961 in  Victoria, where she had lived for  several years in a house with the  improbable name of Lantern Lane  and where she wrote two autobiographical books with the equally  improbable names of "Leaves from  Lantern Lane".  This year Grace Maclnnis did not  run for re-election in Vancouver-  Kingsway. Her seat was won by  another woman, but lost by the  NDPs >r whom Maelnnises had held  the riding for    thirty-six  years.  The situation must produce some very mixed feelings for  Grace Maclnnis.  Three women who form links in  our chain stretching from the  beginning of the century to today. Or to use another metaphor -  three bricks in the foundation  we stand on. Never mind that perhaps we should have built higher  on the foundation by now and  that we have to really stretch to  bridge the deadening gap of the  forties and fifties. Maybe its  not all that important", but its  a nice feeling to know these  pioneers.  I like to know whose  shoulders I'm standing on.  Jo Lazenby V  ORDER   OF CANADA  The Right Honourable L.B. Pearson  announced in a statement to the  House of Commons on April 17th, 1967,  the creation of the Order of Canada.  The Centennial of Confederation provided a particularly appropriate time  to institute the Order of Canada and  it was decided that the first awards  should be made in 1967.  Purpose  The Order was conceived to fill the  need for a distinctly Canadian system  of honours and awards to be used as  a means of recognizing outstanding  merit or gallantry or distinguished  public service in all walks of life.  In this way the Order, like a national  flag and a national anthem, will  become an important means of fostering  national unity and pride of country  by encouraging public service, furthering national ideals and by establishing the highest standards of  merit and achievement.  In conformity  with its distinctly Canadian character the Order includes no titles and  confers no special privileges, hereditary or otherwise. Awards are  made solely on the basis of merit.  Organization j  (Chancellor and Principal Companion)  The Governor General is, by virtue  of that Office, Chancellor and  Principal Companion of the Order and  is charged with the administration  of the Order. He is aided by the  Advisory Council of the Order which  comprises:  ATWOOD, Miss Margaret, BA, AM,  Writer and Poet  Miss Atwood was born in Ottawa,  Ontario, received her BA from Victoria  College, University of Toronto, and  an AM from Radcliffe College, Harvard  University.

Diana Bissell        ^1   NOTES TO MEMBERSâmembership  activities have been running  for a full year now and we've  learned alot about what you want  and don't want to do. Your response  especially to the summer involvement program, has shed much light  on the kind of work you want to  do within the Vancouver Status  of Women. We have set up several  programs this fall that hopefully reflect your needs and  interests.  There are three areas we want to  touch upon.  (1) personal growth  through involvement in Health and  Consciousness Raising Groups,  (2) Writers Workshop,  (3) a chance  to DO something through the Media  and Letter Action Groups.  Health Groups and C-R discussions are  available for those who want to  do some learning/growing. There will  be "first time" C-R groups and an  "intermediate" one. We have names  of contacts in all areas of the  Lower Mainland so don't feel left  out just because you live in Surrey,  Health groups are committed to the  principle that we, as women, should  be taking more responsibility for our  own physical and mental health.  To  belong to one is a fascinating  learning experience.  Call us and sign  up for the new fall group beginning  in September.  We ran a Writer's Workshop this  summer and it was a fine success.  A handbook on how to run such a  Workshop has been written and a  new group will be starting in the  fall.  It won't be a "heavy*!  If  you've ever felt a desire to write  and haven't done so because of  various reasons, or have surreptitiously written something, or if  please   read  this  you like to write and tell everyone,  then the Writer's Workshop has  something to offer you.  There are always people who storm  into our office stating that they  want to DO something about changing  laws/ads/government/men/women etc.  We have two action groups that need  more angry women to make them work!  The Media Action Group works to rid  the world of those onerous, numerous  sexist ads that abound on TV, radio,  and in newspapers and magazines.  If  you are sick of sexism get in touch  with us and we'll tell you how you  can start doing something about it.  And, as mundane as it sounds, we  have formed a strong letter  writing committee,of V.S.W.  It  is imperative that governments  (and others) know of our positive  and negative feelings on issues.  For example, Rosemary Brown needs  more letters of approval for the  Affirmative Action Bill in hopes  that it can be introduced as law  next spring. We must let the  Attorney General know that we  heartily endorse the working  papers of the Berger Commission's  Matrimonial Property Group.  We  need to send letters to Otto  Lang favouring removal of abortion  from the Criminal Code.  (By the  way, he has been flooded with anti=  abortion mail recently and did you  know he keeps a running count of  people for and against?) We need to  demand, question, push, agitate and  communicate in numbers with those  persons in office. This group will  meet to plan and assign research  areas, they will write a newspaper  article and accompanying "clip and  send" letter each month, (see the  article and letter on Income Tax  this month), and will communicate  consistently with Victoria, Ottawa  and other areas.  Interested? Call  us and we'll tell vou when they â  â   meet.(Tues, Sept 11 8 PM Office)  IF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IS GOING TO  GET ANYWHERE WE ARE ALL GOING TO  HAVE TO DO SOMETHING READ   WRITE LETTERS TALK...LEARN MORE  ABOUT YOURSELF AS A WOMAN...COME  TO AN ORIENTATION MEETING...JOIN  ONE OF THE ACTION GROUPS..DONATE  FUNDS TO V.S.W.

ORIENTATION  Since June 1 over 50 people have  attended Orientation Meetings and  half of those have become active  in some way within V.S.W.  Our .  meetings are held every 2nd and  4th Thursday of the month, at 8  PM in the office. We run open  meetings on the second Thursday  and try to get a speaker or  specific topic for the meeting  on the 4th Thursday.  The schedule  for Sept/Oct is as follows:  Thursday, Sept 12 - open meeting.  Thursday, Sept 26 - topic, "C-R  Groups, what are they, how do  they function and are they for  you??" Louise Mattson and members  of her Coquitlam C-R group will  be on hand to assist discussion.  Thursday, Oct 10 - open meeting.  Thursday, Oct 24 - Lee Grills,  formerly of N.O.W. will lead  discussion on the women's movement  generally.  DO SOMETHING THIS FALL.

Dear Editor:  After recently reading the report on the Federal Election's  Women Candidates in the July/Aug.  issue of Kinesis, I was very disappointed.  I found that this article told us, in effect, to vote  for the female candidates because  they are female, not because we  agree with their platforms.  This is a worse form of discrimination than not having the women  run at all!  Surely in a democracy we are expected to vote for  the person we feel is best suited  to fill the post.  If this person  is male or if this person is female  should make no difference as long  as he or she does a thorough and  effective job.  The article in question stated,  "...women candidates in B.C. are  deeply concerned about human  rights and child care programmes  (but) the reality overshadowing  their concerns is that there are  only ten of them. Ten out of one-  hundred and ten". Had there been  a party in this election composed  entirely of women this statement  would be relative to the situation and then there might be cause  for concern. As things stood in this  election however, at least one  woman is representing every party  in existence in Canada. What  conceivable reason is there to  vote for a person according to  their sex? If that candidate upholds his or her party's beliefs  why are we niggling over which  biological sign appertains?  Must our already problematic  dilemma of whether to vote by "party" or "person" be compounded by  introducing "gender"?  Name Withheld  Author's Note: The article deplored  the fact that there has never been  more than a handful of women in  Parliament. It also expressed my  view that serious inequities will  not be corrected nor urgent needs  met until, as I said, voices are  heard where it counts. At no point  was it recommended, or even suggested,  that we should - to quote Name  Withheld - "...vote for the female  candidates because they are female.."  I urged that we work for the nom-  -ination of capable women, whose  stand on major issues we support,  and I made a point of mentioning  that I was personally doing what I  could on behalf of one of one of the  women candidates, ultimately, not  because she was a woman, but because  she cares about justice. A woman who  does not would get neither my efforts  nor my vote.  There are women, as well as men, whom  we may consider unfit to represent  us. It by no means follows that if  one believes more women should be in  Parliament, one should vote for a  woman, whatever her views. This  seems so obvious that it never  occurred to me to put it in words.  - Bobbie Patrick.  EDITORS NOTE: As witnessed by the  above letter, our issue on the July  election did anything but make VSW's  position on the candidates a popular  one.  Let me reassure those who have  made comments like the above, our  intent was not to support candidates  just because they were women. If  you carefully re-read the lead article in the last issue, you will see  that we do not support anyone,  rather we offer you the women candidates that: were running and their  views on what we consider to be  the vital issues.  It is up to you  to decide whether they should receive  your votes or not.  While this air of impartiality was  going on, we had some requests from  political groups to use our membership list for mailing items about'  and for candidates. At the time of  these requests, the executive chose  not to release what we consider confidential information to anyone.  We have, however, met some opposition to these two decisions (i.e.  not to openly support any candidate and not to offer our membership list for mailing purposes)  and we wonder if this disagreement  reflects the feelings of the membership.  The question is should  VSW be more politically active than  it is.  In the next issue we will pursue the  pros and cons of the decisions  made before the election and also  publish a questionnaire,that we  would like to have all members  answer, concerning our stand on  political issues, the services  VSW offers, the choice of not  releasing our membership list and  the question of where our organization is going. Please feel free  to comment, now or when you receive  the questionnaire.  Dear Editor:  When I received my copy of the voting  list for my section of the city, I  was shocked to see that although the  Government advocates equality for all  persons in employment, married women  have absolutely no status in the polling system. All married women living  with their husbands, are listed as:  Mrs. Joe Smith, Mrs. John Doe, etc.  Although I make more money than my  husband and therefore claim our daughter as a dependent on my income tax,  I have no first name or occupation on  this list, however, by daughter who  is now old enough to vote has a first  name and occupation (student), even  though I support her. How can a non  person claim a person on their income tax and why does a non person  have to pay income tax? Interesting questions.  If the Federal Government doesn't  treat women as people, how can they  expect employers, etc., to do so. I  think this is something that should  be investigated.  Yours truly,  Marian Bailey  11  DiÂ¬Ãr Editors:  I do enjoy getting Kinesis,  and usually find a great deal of  information that is both useful  and interesting. I am very glad  to see you refer to "What's Been  Done" as excellent (July 74, pg.  10).  I think it is too!  But...  The Advisory Council on the  Status of Women is composed of  several women and men, including  Joan Wallace and myself. We all  try to take as much part as possible in the work of the Council.  It is not a one person show.  "What's Been Done" was a group  effort: both paid staff and members took part in its creation,  and we are all proud of it.  Dr. Cooke is a great person  to work with and I'm glad she is  getting the recognition she deserves.  But I think she would  agree that credit for our publications (both good and bad) belong to the Council as a whole,  not just herself.  In Sisterhood,  Susan Charlton,  Member, Advisory Council  on the Status of Women  Dear Editor:  It was with furious indignation that I read the preliminary  list of electors in our area. After  my husband's name and address is  clearly marked his occupation, "Printer". After mine there is a BLANK!  Maybe our enumerator was hard of  hearing-I distinctly told her that  my present occupation was that of  "Homemaker". (My neighbor next door  replied, "Domestic Engineer") I do  not like the term housewife. To me  it sounds like fishwife, and is  equally humiliating.  I hope that all the "BLANKS" in  our community did not let this serious discriminating ommissio'n stop  them from casting their vote Monday.  If all we "Blanks" stand up and are  counted, and vote with our God given  intelligence, we may one day have a  woman Prime Minister.  I think it is definitely our turn.  I am by profession a registered  nurse, and from now on will list myself as such, whether I am working  or not.  If homemaking is not work,  I wish that the men of our country  would stay at home and get paid  pittance for 24 hour duty, and let  us run the country.  I know we could  do a better job than has been done  the last few years!  Marie Herbert R.N.  Sister-in-good standing.  I hope.
