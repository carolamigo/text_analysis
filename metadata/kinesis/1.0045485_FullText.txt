WW??* jj  Vancouver Status off Women 2029 W. 4th Ave.  November 1975  VOLUME V NO.50  ISSN 0317-9095-  WOMEN'S CENTER CONFERENCE:  SEPTEMBER 27 - 30o \J  Eight a.m. ~ very, very early' on a  Saturday morning for me — Linda Hurst  from the Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre, Janet Beebe from Sault Ste.  Marie, and Lee Masters and myself  from the Vancouver Status of Women,  stuffed our sleeping bags, our briefcases,and ourselves into my '64  Beetle...off to catch the Tsawwassen  ferry to the first Women's Centre  Conference ever held in B.C.  The Victoria Women's Center were the  organizers, Leith Leslie in particular; Gene Errington's office in the  Provincial-Secretary were the funders  (about $5,000 - from IWY sources).  The conference was to promote communication among all women's centers  "in B.C., especially to enable rural  groups to share info and problems, as  we urban groups.can do all year round  (although we, too need pushes to. communicate) . As many women's centers  as could be found ,in B.C. ■?*■ the aspiring, the struggling, the thriving  —were contacted and^offered one or  two plane tickets to attend. Also  invited were "resource people" -  women who are active in particular  areas of the women's movement, to  give special workshops. The representatives from Vancouver Status of  Women were essentially in this group.  The mailing, and pre-conference organization had only been fair (schedule,  structure plans etc.), partly due to  the (still looming) threat of a mail  strike, and partly due to the late  notice of who was doing what workshop  when. No matter — of all the conferences I've ever been to, this was  still by far the best organized.  So off we were.  The day started off well when we managed to catch the 9-a.m. ferry by a  hair's breadth:  at the point of being~  stopped from going on the ferry, we  raised such a 'hue and cry' that the  crew took pity and let us on .<,. the  last carJ  The conference was at the Thunderbird  Y Camp,- about 17 miles out of Victoria,  near Sooke. The last 3 miles was a  tortuous gravel, one-lane, mountain  alley ... into a valley of brilliant  sun, lots of trees, and even a little  lake. What a wonderful retreat, (at  least for us city slickers!) As it  turned out, it was also cold (although  bearable), for none of the camp bunk-  houses had electricity for heat or  light. Only the large dining hall was  warm and light.  After choosing the least drafty cabin  and unpacking, we loaded ourselves  with our notebooks, peris, cameras, tape  recorders, and trooped into the hall.  Lots of women. Great!  Some old faces  but mostly new (Vancouver really is not the whole B.C. women's movement). We  perused the walls which were lined with  schedules ana lists of workshop topics  and started sorting out what we were  going to choose to go to ... starting  after lunch.  Lunch was wonderful. Salads and cheeses  and breads (home-baked!) and deserts  and fruits of all varieties, all only  giving an inkling of what was to come  for the rest of the- three days (i.e.  turkey!). t Two women had been employed  to cook for the conference — a wonderful contrast to catering, or eating out.  Never have I eaten so well in such a  large group.  WORKGROUPS     ^'^-tSTv-^T.  Workgroups consisted of about 8 women  each (about 7 groups) and wefe, for me,  the main continuing link of contact and  communication throughout the three days.  Their purpose was to provide a. forum  for fairly unstructured discussion on  issues, structures, and ideologies of  our various groups, and to provide a  place for feedback and exchange of our  experiences with the workshops of the  conference.. We were all provided with  an excellent 4-page print-out that suggested areas of discussion, mostly centered on internal issues of group working • '$$0  Workgroups met once each day, for  about two hours.  Some groups  '•'clicked", some didn't; The group  I happened to be in was a particularly dynamic one. We managed to  dispense with the print-out, after  the first afternoon, and dove right  , into some special problems we had  been having with collectivism.  Over the next two days we dealt with  other such "heavies" as volunteerism,  subtle heirarchies, group self-development versus responsibility to the  outside community, structure - good  and bad.  Because of the continuity, work ■  groups sometimes attained the depth  in discussions, that the workshops  rarely dido At the-end of the conference our work group decided to  continue our own private communication  circle through letter writing, to try  to continue sharing our views and our  feelings on the types of issues that  we had dealt with.  WORKSHOPS ^^mrl  There were a lot of workshops, and only  so much time. Always very frustrating.  Five different work-shops were usually  held at one time, so one could only  attend one fifth of them.

Some of. the re-,  source people attended the entire conference, others just came for the particular, workshop they were giving.  It  seemed quite evident that those who  were around for the entire three days  benefited from that contact; those who  weren't had much less time to share  their information with all of us  (because a lot of the exchanges really  took place over meals f  and before bed),  had much less of a sense of what the  particular needs of the workshop "  "recipients" were, and had a much  harder time breaking into the communication we all had already formed with  each other.  The workshops varied greatly from one  another as to what extent they were  discussion, or information, oriented.  They also varied greatly in size, some  being much more 'popular' than others;  some (very few) were not held at all,  and some were held more than Once.  The- content of each workshop, and its  structure had been held quite loose,  no doubt due to the desire to allow  for each workshop to define itself by  the people who attended, and the person giving the workshop.  I found that  somewhat frustrating, however, because  there tended therefore to be a lack of  sufficient preparation on both sides.  The different expectations of those  attending a workshop made it. even  harder for any workshop to take one  direction or another. They were'nonetheless sometimes excellent forums for  the beginnings of dealing with the particular topic.  The Victoria Center is presently compiling the information.that was disseminated in and out of the workshops  into a summation packet that will be  sent out to all who attended"  (Anyone  else interested in seeing the packet  should contact the Victoria group).  OTHER ACTIVITIES  The schedule was so that when we worked,  we really worked, but when we didn't,  there was ample time to relax, read,  sleep, and talk, talk, talk, with each  other. On Sunday and Monday evenings  we had the pleasure of listening to  Ferrori from the Vancouver Health  Collective sing her wonderfully gutsy  and beautiful self-written music, and  Pam from a NOW chapter on her guitar.  There was even time for some of us to  take a spin in a rowboat on the lake  o.c and some were even hardy enough  to take the (odd!) plunge.  AND THE GOODBYES  By Monday evening the energy was  quickly disappearing.  In spite of  careful planning to avoid that happening, it always seems to. Many  women began to leave (mostly due to  other commitments), as early as Monday  afternoon. Those of us who stayed, '  I'm sure, felt the conference end on  a more complete tone; however, we jhad  the burden of feeling quite lonely by  Tuesday morningo The Victoria'organizers stayed active and always available to the end.

We have a vehicle established to hear  our views - Now is a good time to  become involved!  The phrase "affirmative action" has  been appearing more and more in VSB  material - this is something we should  encourage Board members to pursue0  The Management Coordinating Committee  of the Vancouver School Board has recommended to the full board that the  most practical way to achieve integration of staff rooms is to integrate  existing segregated ones. At the  October 6th. meeting, the Board passed a resolution to work for integration of staff rooms. In the past,  staff resistance has been a factor in  maintaining separate facilities.  Dr. Lupini, Superintendent of Vancouver  Schools recently presented a paper to  the Canadian Education Association,  entitled "Women in Administration -  Where Are They?"  Dr. Lupini stated that there is inequity  in administrative assignment between  males and females particularly in B.C.  which has a lower percentage of women  in administration than any other province.  Although 68% of elementary teachers in  B.C. are women only 18% are principals  and only 3% are vice principals.  In  the secondary schools females comprise  31% of the teaching force yet there are  no women principals and only 5 women  vice-principals.  Dr. Lupini asked the delegates to consider the question "to what extent does  the educational system contribute to  the poor representation of women in  leadership position?" He shared with  the audience some of the findings of  the Women in Teaching textbook survey  which documents discrimination against  women and girls. He stated that it  would be wrong to conclude that this  material is responsible for creating  societal behaviour. Dr. Lupini believes that the educational system reflects to a large extent, community  values.  If this situation is to be  corrected, schools and society must  work together. Lupini outlined a  three-dimensional approach which includes changes in personnel policies,  educational policies and promotional  policies.  Dr. Lupini was one of the educators  invited to Ottawa for the one day conference Action - 75 Plus. The aim of  the conference was to focus on positive  programmes that have been implemented  in both the public and private sectors  to assist women's fuller integration  into the work force. Discussions also  centered around action required to  overcome the negative effects of current stereotyping of roles for men  and women.  appointments  Julia Goulden, a counsellor in the  Burnaby school system for the past  nine years, has been appointed the  education department's special advisor  on sex discrimination in B.C. schools.

Avenue, Vancouver. The specific purpose of the organization is  to get single parents together.. It  is emphasized that PWP is not to be  thought of as a "pairing-off" club.  It is more than a Social Club.. Its  aim is to have a place where people  with common concerns can come and  meet in an environment where they  are not "odd-man-out" or "odd-woman-  out" because of their single status.  The membership stands at 300 of the  Vancouver Chapter and the breakdown  has been roughly two women to every  man. This, however, is changing,  since a great many more men are being  given custody of the children in marriage break-ups. There are people of  all ages in PWP, the majority being  in their 30's and 40's.  There are two general meetings and  two orientation meetings every month,  and a Dance. At the general meeting  after the business is attended to,  there.is usually a speaker to discuss  some topic of' particular concern to  PWP, such as Children's Aid or Law.  One recent speaker was from the Pacific Institute and the topic was  "Building Self-image." Or there may  be discussion groups organized.  About 12 to 16 people come out to  the orientation meetings held for  newcomers. One can obtain a Visitor's  Pass and attend any of the meetings  and/or Social evenings for a month.  Sunday is Family Activities Day, which  means camp-outs and picnics in summer,  bowling and skating etc. in winter.  There is an "adult only" Sunday even-_  ing Social time when members can come  together for coffee and talk, or dance  - from 8 to 10:30 p.m.  Obviously, many single parents have  money problems, so budget is always  in mind when planning events at PWP.  On a recent family trip to Squamish  on the "Royal Hudson", all the children had their tickets paid for by  PWP.  It costs members 50c for the  Sundaysocial evening, visitors-$1.00.  Membership in PWP costs $12.00 per  year. There is a monthly Newsletter  called "The Bridge-Builder" from the  Chapter, as well as a monthly issue  of the "Single Parent's Magazine"  which comes from the States.  If you would like to find out more  about PARENTS WITHOUT PARTNERS, phone  their Answering Service at 266-7624  and someone will call you later with  all the information you require and  with a warm invitation to come out and  join them at one of their meetings or  social get-togethers.  Vancouver President is Joan Birchall.  Elsie Pomfret, Treasurer, who kindly  gave us all the above information,  says "single parents need to get out  amongst people and build up that self-  confidence. As soon as they start  doing things, they feel better."

The Challenges Facing Formerly Married  Women.  The Department of National Health and  Welfare, the YWCA and the United Way  have sponsored a research project to  explore the interests, needs, problems, and attitudes of women between  the age of 40 and 60, who have been  married, but due to separation, di~  vorce or widowhood are no longer married.

After the business portion of the  meeting, Ed Ryan of the Federal Law  Reform Commission and David Cruick-  shank of the Berger Commission discussed family law.  Ed Ryan felt that "the women's movement is dissipating a lot of its  energy.  If you want to come to grips  with basic discrimination, look at  Family Law. Marriage is the basic  relationship and the assumptions  behind it is what the economy and  power structure is based on. You  must have legal equality in the marriage relationship or you won't have  it outside it. WOMEN GROWING TOGETHER  International Women's Year has been  an exciting one for Big Sisters in  'ĢVancouver. Funding from the United  Way, Department of Human Resources  and the city of Vancouver has made  a full-time staff possible for the  first time in. Big Sister's 16 year  history.  "Big Sisters" is a group of women  working with women. They are committed to self-growth, to support  of younger women in need of a special friend, and support to the families of these younger women. While  20% of Little Sisters have both parents, 66% come from fatherless homes  and 14% from motherless homes. The  single parent, whether mother or  father, is often faced with the onerous task of providing for several  small children, therefore, at times  is lacking the necessary energy to  meet all the emotional demands of a  growing family. Here, the Big Sister  can lend support by providing a listening ear, emotional, social and cultural enrichment plus plain old-fashioned fun.  bankers, X-ray technicians, students,  physiotherapists. - Several are married.  All undertake training in peer counselling' and communication skills.  Because  they are successful in the'ir own lives,  the Big Sisters are uniquely equipped  to help a younger girl struggling to grow  up in our complex society.  Big (Sisters?/  Little Sisters who come from motherless homes often have no female role  model.  Big Sisters, having themselves  grown up successfully, deeply involved  in their own lives and the world, can  provide a very positive model for a  younger woman.  Some Little Sisters  are recent arrivals in Canada, from  diverse ethnic backgrounds, and need  help to find their place in a new culture.  In these cases particularly, the  whole family shares in the enrichment  - and competence the Big Sister brings.  Four Little Sisters and one Big Sister  are North American Indians.  Big Sisters is an organization of 87  young women age 20-35 who have volunteered to give 5 hours per week for at  Least one year, in a one-to-one relationship, as a special kind of friend  for a girl aged between 7 and 18. The  volunteer hours given by this group total more than 1600 each month. These  are very meaningful hours because Big  Sisters, are engaged in numerous occupations - secretaries, teachers, nurses,  stewardesses, stockbrokers, lawyers,  "The committment of the volunteers  gives our organization a feeling of  excitment," according to Merne Bruchet  Big Sisters President. "We are growing B.Dth in numbers of relationships  and also in scope. Our most recent  undertaking is regular gatherings at  Family Place for a varied activity  programme for both Big and Little  Sisters. CP. Air Employees Charitable Fund, this summer, gave us a  generous sum which "We are using for  this new activity. We use colourful  materials--paints, pastels, yarns  and fabrics. We are all learning  crafts--macrame, potting, quilt-making, as well as finger-painting and  clay sculpture. We sing, talk, eat  and play together. We include human  potential awareness training in these  programmes, drawing on many specialists in the community for leadership."  This programme in no sense replaces  the basic one-to-one relationship,  but rather supplements and enriches  it. Since some of our Little Sisters  are shy and uncertain about moving  out into the world, we are eager to  provide a relaxed and caring atmosphere where they can interact with  their peers, each at her own speed.  We have a dream that this series will  culminate in a week-end "live-in" at  Camp Yawaca next Spring. With such  support we hope most of the younger  girls will feel sufficiently confident to attend camps on their own  next summer.  important  REMINDER  Members who are interested in running  for a position on the VSW Board of  Directors for 1976-77 should remember  that to qualify they must be members  in good standing for six months prior  to elections. Elections for the Board  of Directors are held at the Annual  General Meeting in June and therefore  to qualify candidates must be VSW  members as of December 1975.  Volunteer Big Sisters make a home  visit following a request for a Big  Sister, before placement is made.  At this, time we make clear to the  family our aims in the relationship.  Our goal is for everyone to gain --  Big and Little Sisters and the family  too. Little Sisters are referred to  us by school counsellors, public  health nurses, social workers, physis-  ians and parents."Big Sisters" wel^  comes enquiries from parents too,  since these particular requests often come before significant problems  have developed. The placement of a  Big Sister at this time makes great  sense in terms of prevention.  The Big Sisters applicant attends an  Information Night to learn what being  a member entails. We are constantly  amazed at the numbers and the calibre  of young women who volunteer to be  Big Sisters because it is a heavy commitment for women already deeply involved in the world.  At the moment, there are 44 Big Sisters  involved in training groups. These are  . informal and open-ended, tailored to  the needs of Big and Little Sisters.  We are currently developing an intensive research programme to evaluate our  effectiveness. In the future, we hope  to establish more unanimity of purpose  by developing programmes for parents.  Using the Carl Rogers model of the Helping Relationship we seek to develop a  cohesive approach to the resolution of  individual and family difficulties.  The intimate and dynamic relationship  which develops between Big and Little  Sisters gives us an opportunity to  offer real support to the whole family.  Our way is in no sense intrusive, but  rather invitational. We have skills in  communication and are eager to share  them.

I know  my husband feels that way."  - 1970 statement by Mrs. Richard  Nixon while she was entertaining members of the Status of Women Commission Lornex Mines: Beware!    V  /  This is a call for strong watchdog  tactics, by all concerned with equal  rights, on the behaviour of^Lornex  Mines to their female employees.  Lornex Mines, a large copper mining  corporation at Logan Lake, B.C. (near  Ashcroft), is continuing to wage a  very stubborn battle with the B.C.  Human Right Commission and the complaining women employees, to prevent women attaining any semblance of their  just and equal status within Lornex.  A. sex discrimination case was brought  against Lornex early in 1974 by the  H.R.C. on behalf of Dr. Claire Bukwa.  Lornex would not make camp accommodation available to her, as they did,  free of charge, to their male employees. After months of investigation,  letters, pressure from women's and  labour groups, and Human Rights hearings, Lornex was charged in August  1974 with being in direct contravention of the Human Rights Code. They  were ordered to pay Dr. Bukwa $2,713 -  in compensation for the accommodation  expenses she had incurred, and they  were directed to make accommodation  available to female employees "on the  same terms and conditions" as men, and  to ensure that all females in the company would be made aware of this right.  Lornex immediately appealed the dici-  sion ... and that is where the situation still stands!  In September 1974, the Human Rights  Commission again became involved with  Lornex Mines, this time on behalf of  Jean Tharp. (see "Kinesis"- Dec. 1974  issue) Ms. Tharp had just been granted the opportunity to live at the camp  (although she had requested it months  earlier), but Lornex was making the  conditions very unattractive, to say  the least. Ms. Tharp-had a room in a  bunkhouse occupied by 19 men (while  there were other trailers at the camp  that were empty).  She was forced to  use communal bathroom facilities, where  the urinals showers, and toilets were  all in the same open area. She also  had to pay for these 'accommodations',  whereas the men did not. Health Inspectors forced Lornex to divide the washroom facilities into a men section and  a women's section. However, men could  continue to walk through Jean's side of  the bunkhouse, and as the washroom remained open from her side, she still  had little privacy.  Lornex claims that they did supply  accommodation to Jean Tharp "on the  same terms and conditions" as to the  men. IIIIIf  This is, of course, rampantly absurd!

June 1975:  The Credit Grantors Association of Vancouver has now issued guidelines to its  members to avoid sexual discrimination  in the granting of credit.  The Association, the largest in B.C.,  is a voluntary organization, and its  members will not be forced to follow  the recommended guidelines.  "Nevertheless," Minister Phyllis Young said,  "this move is an important first step.  The credit industry is in fact recognizing past abuses regarding discrimination  against women applying for credit. The  industry's association is recommending  to its members not to discriminate in  the future, and they are spelling out  the ways to guarantee fairness."  The basic guidelines to be distributed  by the Credit Grantors Association to  its members are as follows:  1. No married women shall be denied  credit in her own name if her un-  commingled earnings or separate  property are such that a man possessing the same amount of property or earnings would receive  credit.  2. No unmarried woman shall be denied  credit if her property or earnings  are such that a man possessing the  same amount of property or earnings  would receive credit.  3. A credit reporting agency shall,upon  the request of a married person,  identify within the report delivered  by the agency both the credit history  of each spouse and of their joint accounts, if such information is on  file with the credit reporting agencyc  Along with these principles, the Credit  Grantors Association is recommending  that certain specific practices be refrained from, such as:  * refusing to negotiate credit with the  wife and insisting on dealing with  the husband instead.  * altering an, individual's credit rating  solely on the basis of the credit rating of the spouse.  Ms. Young cited a few of the most outstanding abuses which, she said, "women  have had to confront when applying for a  loan or other credit."  * Women are often refused credit, where  a man in exactly the same economic position would be granted credit.  * Conversely, even though they could manage it, women are often denied credit  solely because of the credit history  of their spouse.  * Wives have had to use credit cards in  their husband's name, and could often  apply for any kind of credit only with  their husband's written approval.  * Divorced or separated women are sometimes denied credit solely because it  is thought their support payments may  stop.  * Widows also are too frequently discriminated against.  * Credit reporting agencies until recently have usually kept files on family  units, and credit grantors too often  only accepted information about husbands.  It is understood that separate files  are now maintained if requested by the  consumer.  * Some, people have actually thought that  women could .not legally be held responsible for debts they incur. That is  not true.  The move by the Credit Grantors  Association to stop this type of  discrimination followed several  months of discussion between the  Association and officials of the  Department of Consumer Services.  "It comes in the middle of International Women's Year," the minister noted, "and I am pleased to  see the action of the Credit Grantors Association. We will watch  closely to see how these guidelines are followed in practice."  - Reprinted from Federated Anti-  Poverty Groups of B.C. Newsletter,  October,1975.  ibm  Thanks to member Lee Grills and the  IBM Company, workers at the VSW office no longer have to run down the  street with dimes clutched in our  hands whenever we need a copy made  of something.  i,ee, an employee of IBM, applied  to the company's Community Service  Fund on behalf of VSW and lo and  behold we received $450 towards a  copier! We are very grateful to  Lee and to IBM.  Lee has suggested that other members investigate the resources of  the firms they work for. Many have  Community Service Funds similar to  IBM's. If so, a brief could be submitted outlining what VSW does and  what it is in need of to carry on  this work. We sure could use another typewriter! Susan Levin is a VSW member who,while  she lived in Vancouver, was a regular  contributor to Kinesis. Orginally from  the USA,she had lived for some time  in Israel and a few months ago returned to Israel. She has written a long  letter to the women of VSW discussing  her feelings about the effects of  Jewish religious customs on women and  her impressions of women and the women's movement in Israel.  In the few weeks I spent in New York  City before arriving in Israel, I got  a sense of what to expect from one  aspect of the women's movement in  Israel. I expected initially the regular sort of setup —C-R groups,  letter writing groups, action on  issues such as abortion, salaries,  human rights.  But in New York City, I came across  an article in a new Jewish magazine  called Moment. The article, in the  very first issue of the magazine discussed the Jewish women's movement  Which had evolved from the secular  women's movement. To explain —  many Jewish women had participated  and worked in the women's movement  for several years, but found that  the Jewish aspects of their lives  (in the home, in religious ceremonies  and customs) remainded the same —  frustratinelv traditional.  What's so frustrating about Jewish  tradition? Jewish tradition, among  the orthodox, places women at the  back of the synagogue behind a curtain during prayer services (so that  men will not be unduly distracted  during prayer). Men only, perform  religious services, men only have  a rite of induction into the people  of Israel (circumcision), only men  may read from the Torah, wear prayer  shawls and intricate prayer wrappings  during services. Ten men, not people,  constitute the traditional minimum  for a public prayer service, etc.etc.  Some of these are customs, some written  law — some as extreme as the prayer  of orthodox men thanking God that  they were created men and not women.  (Yes, I was pretty shocked to find  such a prayer existed in Judism).  For someone like me who doesn't  really identify with public prayer  services, these are not issues I  feel I have to deal with in my liberation. (Although even as I write  this I wonder how much more interested I'd be in ritual and ceremony if  all my life I'd felt that my presence in synagogue was valued, was  equal.) But for women for whom these  rituals and customs are a part of  daily life, to see, understand and  begin to experience the possibility  of equality — say through the women's  movement — and then return home or  go to the synagogue and be denied  physical , educational, spiritual  equality is intolerable.  All these customs, laws and interpretations are written down — in the  Bible and in volumes called the Halachah  (the Way). Why is this important?  According to the Moment article, recourse to the Halachah is one avenue  religious Jewish women have of reclaiming their spiritual equality. They can  take the initiative and study the Halachah (in itself tradition-breaking  for women) or approach a sympathetic  rabbi thus:"Rabbi we believe that we  can sit in the same part of the synagogue as men. Help us to find an interpretation of the law that supports  our claim, that shows that we are  equal spiritually. We want to be counted as members of the prayer service,  Teach us an interpretation that we can  use in our congregation that will prove  that it is only men's tradition, not  the heart of Jewish law, that says we  do not count for prayer^ services."  It may look like super nitpicking, as  at times it does to me, but a few more  brilliant reinterpretations of  Moses'  laws would be a big boon to the religious women's movement — in the States  and in Israel. And it would make things  a lot easier for the secular movement  here in Israel as well,* since religious traditional law is the basis for  marriage and divorce law.  What has the religious women's movement accomplished? They have worn  prayer shawls to services and prayer  bindings. They have initiated all-  women services. They have insisted  on being counted for the required  minimum participants in synagogue.  They have proposed and composed a  baby naming ceremony for girl children to parallel the boys' curcumcis-  ion. They are questioning the passive  roles of volunteer fund raisers and  charity workers and are looking for  political expression in the synagogue  administration.. All these are important precedents.  Apologists claim that the Jewish mother of up to seventy years ago was a  bastion of strength and honour, not  the neurotic butt of jokes she often  is today. I'm not convinced that  those generations had it so good  since so many religious women are  working so hard today to -take an  equal part in prayer services.(If  anyone wanted to do some background  reading on this Brandeis University  put out a.special issue of their magazine Response of and by women in  July 1973. It is available from  Post Office.Box 1496, 415 South St.  Waltham, Mass. 02154.^2.00).  So that was the eye-opener in New  York. I hadn't known all that had  been going on for the last few years.  Since I've returned to Israel to live  I've had my mind blown and my spirit  calmed (the latter a result of this  holy land-r— and I mean the very soil  and a sense of history — not the  conditions for women.)  Next month Susan talks about Israel  and what it is like to be a woman  there today.  women and police  According to the British Columbia  Police Commission's Bulletin #2:  "During the past year the number of  women employed in police wofk has  doubled. Approximately 20 per cent  of the recruits at the new B.C.  Police College are women. Women are  now being deployed in general duty,  and all the experience reported to  the Commission has been positive.  Attention has been focused on the  position of the women victims of  crime, particularly rape victims.  A research report based on Vancouver  Police files has been drafted, and  further work in this area is planned  for the coming year."  HOWEVER: From what members on the  B.C. Police Commission Task Force  heard, all the experiences of women  in the police forces have not been  positive. There has been much resistance among some police chiefs even  to employ women, and then when employ  ed, to deploy them in an equal capacity with the men. While attitudes  may be improving, they are far from  ideal as yet.  Also the B.C. Police Commission Task  Force, constituted in May 1974, was  given very limited power to conduct  "•research and evaluation on women and  police — women as victims, women as  offenders, women as police. The proposal to make this Task Force effective, presented to the Commission by  all the women on the Task Force, has  so far been quite rudely rejected.  There has been only continuous discouragement in setting up forums  where the issues in these areas can  be researched and evaluated by the  women who are themselves involved  in the problems. The women of the  Task Force are still pressing the  B.C. Police Commission to consider  this proposal"  questions  QUESTIONS WANTED'  The Women's Communications Centre has  now spent four full months investigating the needs for and possible functions of a national womenV resource  centre.

Marc Lalonde, Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, in a  speech to the House of Commons on  October 15, 1974. Concerned Canadian women have been asking that  question for years.  Much of our society still views women as being either partially or  wholly dependent on men for financial support, and thus not entitled  to the same rate of pay as men. There  have been some positive changes in  attitude in recent years but we still  have a long way to go. The effects  of years of "conditioning" experienced by females in schools, family relationships and media portrayal,  have yet to be erased.  Then there is the biological argument.  Iona Campagnola, M.P. for Skeena,  spoke most eloquently about this male  hang-up in the House on May 29, 1975  — a day devoted entirely to women's  issues. She said:     v^^^V1  "Are there 20% price cuts in theatre  tickets, for instance, (and I might  add shelter, food and clothing) to  the hardworking ladies-wear clerk who  makes 20% less than the male clerk  selling lingerie beside her?  Ah, but the potential employer says  gravely: "No matter how competent  you may be, you may prove to be unreliable because women have babies."  I submit once and for all, so do men.  Parenthood is not a unilateral business.'^ Amen!)  Deficient legislation —  But why should societal attitudes be  a factor when most provinces now have  legislation designed to deal with  wage disparities? Mr. Lalonde shed  some light on this in a further statement on May 29th. He said:  "The discrepancy between law and  practice is illustrated by the wage  gap between women and men which continues to exist despite the fact  that in all provinces but one (P.E.I);  discrimination in employment is now  prohibited by law."  The Minister then compared average  salaries before and after the legislation. In 1962, the figures were:  men - $5,014 and women - $2,634. In  1971, the figures were: men - $8,513  and women - $4,755. Women were still  earning 44% less than men in 1971..  The most recent Statistics Canada  figures show that in 1975 - International Women's Year - the gap is  actually widening. So obviously something is wrong.  A major problem is the wording of  the legislation itself. The phrases  "equal pay for equal work" and "similar to" are very vague and open to  all sorts of abuse and misinterpretation. The Royal Commission on the  Status of Women found strong evidence  to support the claim that some employers go out of their way to find,  or make, a difference in the duties  of women and men so that the different rates can be paid within the  letter of the law.  And what about the more than 60% of  working women who fall into the "job  ghettos" that have no male equivalent?  For instance, secretarial work —  what is it equal to in the male field,  a clerk, a junior bookkeeper, an  accountant, or just what? How does a  woman even make a case to Human Rights  officers when there are no men doing  similar work?  In view of this deficient law, women's  groups have been advocating a system  of job evaluation. This would be done  'by government-appointed evaluators  and would concentrate in the traditionally "female occupations". The  Toronto-based National Action Committee stated in its May issue of  Status of Women News:  "Equal pay for work of equal value  looks at the value of work — the  value to the employer - based on  these criteria of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions.  Under such a law, a typist (or sewing machine operator) could lay a  complaint with the appropriate government department and challenge the  rate she was being paid as compared  with the rate of a male accountant  (or floor sweeper) in the same firm  (or factory)."  The Advisory Council on the Status  of Women supports this method even  more strongly. They ask that when  the federal Human Rights Commission  is created, it "be empowered to set  guidelines in all sectors of the  economy." Such a move would strengthen existing provincial and upcoming  federal legislation, arid enable Human Rights officers to enforce the  law more effectively.  Economic influences — ;  We should then have an "ideal" solution. But wait — there is yet another  villain. What effect will the worsening economic situation in Canada have  on equal pay for women? We can look  to England for the answer to this  questions  Recently the government of that country had planned to implement the"final  stages of a five-year program to give-  women equal pay with men. But the employers pointed out that many women  would lose their jobs because of England's depressed economy. So women  were given a choice — equal pay or  their jobs. The women (probably out  ot sheer desperation) chose their  jobs.  This reflects negatively on the male  population of England but I can visualize the same thing happening here.  We have heard employers crying the  blues about large wage increases for  men. Can you see them being in a  hurry to equalize the salaries of  their female employees? If equal pay  legislation is enforced, they will  just cut back and lay off. Women will  once again get the short end of the  stick.  It is therefore imperative that all  politicians do their utmost to im-.  press on business and industry that  Ln the event of an economic crunch,  ooth males and females must be treated equally. In other words, employers  must curb the insatiable wage demands  of the predominantly ,ma.le,wortk fprce, r.  that is already well.paid. Only then  will they be in a position to equalize female wages without straining  the economy beyond its capability.  Possible solutions. —  Most of you are by now familair with  Prime Minister Trudeau's Thanksgiving  Day lunch with the Premiers and the  resultant "economic guidelines". Lawyers and accountants have yet to decipher all the implications,, but perhaps we have found the "equalizer".  It all depends on whether or not the  federal government is truly sincere -  in its stated intention to narrow the  wage gap between women and men.  If it is, then the Human Rights Bill  introduced by former Justice Minister  Otto Lang, on July 21st will receive  top priority. Only speedy passage of  this Bill — together with a comprehensive job evaluation program —  will enable women to win wage increases higher than the 8, 10 or 12%  permitted under the guidelines. In  Mr. Lalonde's words (Ottawa, October  15), the wage guides "make exceptions  for the elimination of sex. dicriminat-  ion in any pay practices."  If the government is not sincere, it  will sit on the Bill and do nothing.  The Prime Minister and his.colleagues  have quite a decision to make — will  they use the new guidelines as an  "equalizer" to correct wage disparities between women and men? Or will  they be reluctant to do so because  of the male backlash that will no  doubt occur if they act in favour o£  women? A decision must be made —  and there will be fireworks either  way!  Therefore, the Letter Lobby Committee  urges all VSW members and their friends  to write a letter immediately. Our  federal politicians now have the mechanism necessary for positive action  — will they have the guts to follow  through? We must find out the answer  to this question because women have  worked for half-pay long enough!  Hon. Marc Lalonde,  Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women  Parliament Buildings  Ottawa, Ontario. K1A 0K9  Dear Mr. Lalonde;  I am deeply concerned, as I believe  you are, about the widening wage gap  between women and men. Provincial  legislation is ineffective except in  the most clear-cut cases of wage discrimination. It is of no value to the  more than 60% of women who fall into  the "job ghettos" that have no male  equivalent.  Working women could also be the biggest losers under the new economic  guidelines, unless the government is  prepared to take further positive  action. Your recent statement that  the wage guides "make exceptions for  the elimination of sex discrimination in any pay practices" is encouraging.

It  seems that the women working in.the  home either doesn't have the time  we thought she might have to step  out and get involved in a discussion  for a few hours, or she is still  hesitant about walking into a  "status of women" discussion. Our  advertising was extensive and  "soft-sell" but we are still having  problems at some centres.

I realize that if the government were  to give women this opportunity to  "catch up", the move would be unpopular with men.

During this time they .attended the International Women's Week in  Lisbon.' ^*^T:X''V  WOMEN IN PORTUGAL  women's wee  The International Women's Week in  Lisbon was held from Monday, July  28 to Saturday, August 2. The conference was organized by MLM (Movimento Liberacao Mulheres) the Portuguese organization for the liberation of women, and MCALG (Moviemento  para a Contracaepcao e Aborto e livre  gratuitb) an action-group for free  abortion and contraception. The ren-  devous and information centre for the  week was Women's House, a house which  was occupied by a group of women after  the coup in April 1974.  Representatives from Women's LibErat-  ion Movements in several countries .  arrived to take part in the activities. Among those represented were  movements in Belgium^ Luxembourg, USA,  Holland, England, Germany and France.  An important part of the week's programme was a report on the women's  situation in Portugal and the events  following the Revolution. Two days  were devoted to debate on free abortion and contraception—a highly in-  flamnable issue in Catholic Portugal  where abortion and propaganda in  favour of it are illegal. After the  revolution, however, nurses began giving abortions on their own, and the  government has turned a blind'eye to  this. An essential part of the.debate  on abortion and contraception was a  meeting with the doctors arid workers  at St. Maria's Hospital where the role  of the medical profession in the abortion question was.discussed.  The rest of the  -*.k was takeri up  by debate on the t  'tion of women  in the class strugg..  on international solidarity, t.nd on     ;>" -.   ~~  different forms of oppression which  women are exposed to.

W>*m?s2  REPORT AS TO THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE REVOLUTION AND THE  SITUATION OF WOMEN IN THE STRUGGLE  FOR RADICALIZATION.  At the present moment there is a  political vacuum in the government and in the middle classes.  The- MEA government is still feeling  its way forward and has not yet  been able to consolidate and apply  its new policies. The middle  classes are confused and it is to  be remembered that the revolution  has only just begun, and that  there Is a strong danger of a  counter-revolution.  The working classes are using this  time to consolidate and organize  a movement towards a democratic  people's control*of all sections  of government; a democracy where  they themselves take part in the  decision-making process.  Immediately after the coup on  April 25, 1974^j:here was a general  move against atttlf&'rity. We began  to question the authority of the  landowners and thl^cisses in the  factories. Many textile factories  are now under the workers' control.  The majority of workers in the ^£r- **"  textile industry are women and  they have played a large role in  the struggle. Their success is  important too, when one remembers  that they were also the most  underpaid.  We shall describe the situation at  some of the factories which the women  now run by themselves.  We have noticed that in all these  struggles women were not well represented.on the committees and were always in the minority, despite the fact  that they represented the majority of  workers in the factory. The double burden ie..women also run^the home, is  probably partly responsible for thiSc  Even where the women had started  the fight,' it became the men who ran  the struggle. The women themselves  often elected the men to the  workers committees even when the  women were in the_majority. At  Alentejo where the workers have  taken over agricultural units  formerly owned by large landowners,  there are no women on the council  at all, despite the fact that the  women do precisely the same job  as the men. The men claim that  the women are incapable of discussion and working on committees.  In a recent editorial in the local  newspaper in Alentejo entitled  'Equal Wage for all', it was proposed that a national wage of 190  . escudos should be instituted for  men, and 140 escudos for women.  Because of the women's absence  from the cpmmltte.es, the sub  jects of maternity, creches, abortion,  or salary discrimination are never  discussed. Most committees accepted  differential salaries, and where the  leaders wanted to introduce equal pay  the men threatened to strike on the  grounds that the women's work was inferior anyway. Some used strikes to  get even better wage increases at the  expense of the women. After the workers' struggle on the shopflo.or or in  the country, people started demanding  better living conditions. There was a  general movemerit for better living  conditions and many occupied houses  in the suburbs, especially those who  had previously elept in sheds, tin  shacks, or in the open. But in this  case too, the women only followed what,  what the men did.and nowhere took the  initiative..They seem to follow what  the men think is best and do not put  forward their own problems. In every  single revolutionary council the wo- *  men are in the minority.  In one factory which produces very  •expensive dresses the women took over  production when the bosses fled and  left the factory to itself. Although  the women had had no previous experience, the factory is running smoothly  under their control. The women are also  directing the sales and distribution  without outside help.  When women take over a factory  they often have difficulties over  and above the usual. Because  they also have to stay and guard  the factories at night they can't  come home to their families and  their men don't like it and exert  pressure on them to come home, and  to quit the job. Many men have  deserted their women because they  refuse to do what the women have  always done; running the home and  looking after the children. The  women who have been deserted have  then been forced to return home to  look after the children who would  otherwise be stranded, and one  particular factory h?' only 70 women  left out of a previou 140.  Because of an economic crisis which  is based upon a world recession,  an economic boycott against Portugal, and the flight of managerial  staff, and former owners, the  workers have often been forced to  take over factories themselves  without any help from the trade  unions or from MFA. The_ choice has  been to either allow production to  cease or to give it a go on their  own.  In a factory which formerly made  really expensive handmade goods  problems have arisen because the  lines of production have had to be  changed. In the first place, money  is not available for expensive  goods and secondly, the demand is  for ready-to-wear practical shoes,  something which the working classes  badly need. This problem is a  temporary one, however, for as  soon as the stocks of expensive  material which the fprmer owner left  behind have been used up, the women  will be able to turn production over  to durable and comfortable shoes  for general use. We really must coordinate the struggle.  At another factory the women could  not get hold of new raw materials  because of the international boycott  against Portugal. There are only 21  out of a former 120 workers left, and  production has all but ceased. Often  the workers are left to sort out  their problems on their own and at  one factory the women ran crying  back to their former owner and begged  him to come back and help them. The  same thing has happened at one of the  largest dry-cleaners ^.n Lisbon.  The positive aspect of the struggle  has been that women have come together and for the first time talked  about common problems; for example,  maternity, the oppressive sex-role .  they are forced to play, sexuality,  the need for creches, collective  housework, etc. This is at least a  first stage, but an active part in  the revolutionary and democratic  process still has to come. The fact  remains that women's problems still  are not taken up at the workers'  committees. Forty years of fascism  has robbed women of the experience  of deciding over their own lives and  destinies, and of organization, political, social, and economic. The  men dominated all the new movements  which arose after the revolution.  A politician on the extreme left said  recently that women would laugh at him  if he took up problems like housework and- abortion. But we have had  exactly the opposite experience.  There are many laws still existing  which were passed in fascist or pre- .  fascist Portugal and which have yet to  be repealed. For example, abortion is  strictly forbidden.by law, and even  propaganda in favour of abortion is  forbidden. These laws have, not been  changed since 1866. In spite of the  anti-abortion legislation 'back-  street' abortions have always taken  place and on rather a large scale in  a country with a population of under  9 million. It is estimated that at  least 150,000 abortions are performed  every year. These abortions are performed by very primitive methods which  very often lead to infection and  death; for example, women in the  country perform abortions on themselves with needles. The upper  classes, however, have always been  able to organize safer abortion,  either by traveling to another-country or by bribing a doctor 2,000 to  3,000 escudos for an illegal abortion.  Abortion has assumed such a dominant  part in the Portuguese sgciety because of the repressive policies of  the former regime and because of the  oppressive patriarchal attitudes of  the Portuguese male towards contraception. The Pill was forbidden by  the former fascist government. After  the coup in April 25, 1974, the prir  vate clinics have begun to write  prescriptions for the Pill. They have  also begun to perform abortions. Both  jthese developments are still illegal  and so despite the fact that the  government turns a blind eye to these  practices the responsibility still  rests with the individual doctor.  Condoms have, however,.always been  available, probably because it is a  contraceptive for men. In order to'  get hold of the Pill a woman must  have a doctor's prescription.- Many  doctors have a reactionary attitude  towards cqntraception and refuse to  write out a prescription. The  woman is therefore entirely at the  mercy of the doctor. What we need  is adequate legislation to ensure  free abortion and contraception.so  that the doctor can only play the  medical role and so that the woman  herself decides whether she wants the  abortion or Pill. Despite vague unofficial, support from MFA, nothing  has been yet done, and women continue to die and unwanted babies continue to be born.    ^Tll?%»^~* £ is^"5  however, regard the abortion and contraception question as a part of the  revolution. This concluded the Report  and the meeting was then opened to  discussion.  -Some of the questions  are reported here.  Q: Although the revolution has  happened, the position of the  women doesn't appear to have  §   changed at all I ^Cj.>g^  MCALG: I do not agree that the  women's situation has not changed at  all; one should remember that most of "  the factories which began striking  before April 25 were factories where  women were in the majority, and the confidence gained in the struggle~~ls an  .important factor.  Q: Could you clarify the different political parties' attitude towards the  women's struggle?  After the coup a group of nurses  began giving abortion on their own,  but this is on a small scale, and  only reaches those who can afford  200 escudos. One riurse is performing as many as 7 abortions a day.  Most men in Portugal have a very  reactionary attitude towards women,  something which is supported by the  remaining fascist legislation. A  woman cannot leave the country without her husband's permission. If a  man kills his wife because she committed adultry, his only punishment  is to leave the district for six  months. The man has legal and social  power over his wife's body; for  example, it is he who decides if she  is to live or to die in a dangerous  childbirth where the doctors re-  comment destroying the child in order  to allow her to live. He has also  legal control over the child before  it is born. Some women have up to 14  children, of which half usually die  because the woman is too tired and  worn by childbearing to care whether  they or she survive or not. Most men  forbid their wives to use contraceptives and if a woman tried to get  condoms from a chemist she would be  humiliated.  The Portuguese Communist Party has mentioned liberalisation of abortion in  its programme, but the section on  abortion is extremely vague and they  have made no attempt to influence the  government on this question. MDH  (Movimento Democracao Mulheres) which is  the Communist Party's women's organization, regards the abortion and  contraception question as unimportant  at the moment because MDM regards the  implementation of the revolution as  the chief priority. MLM and MCALG,  MLM: The Left supports the women as  workers and when they take over  factories as workers. But women are  often excluded from discussions and the  Communist Party is not discussing  women's questions.at ALL.  In fact, the  men are maintaining their position of.  dominance and oppression.  Q: Is there a danger that the conservatives can mobilize the women  against MFA in the same way that  they mobilized in Chile?  MLM: The women are not politically  aware and the Left is against the  women's movement. They say they are in  favour of abortion, but because the  situation is fluid they don't have to  commit themselves. Even when the  women have something to say at meetings, they have to behave like men to  be heard, and they can only speak on  men's topics. This hardly raises  consciousness.  We feel however that there are great  possibilities, of MLM growing, despite  the fact that the organization is  small and the political awareness of  jthe members is little developed.  Most politically active women are  lp|||l  already enmeshed in party politics  and haven't yet understood the necessity of working separately as well, or  just haven't the time because they  have to do the housework too. It requires a high level of awareness to  understand that a women's organization  is also necessary. MLM goes out to  factories and farms, both individually  arid collectively, and discusses with  the women about their own situation  which is the best and most direct way  of raising their consciousness. BOOK REVIEW  WOMEN IN CHINA. Katie Curtin.  Pathfinder Press, N.Y. and Toronto.  1975.  While I was at the Women's Center  Conference in Victoria a few week-' «•  ends ago, and browsing through the  bountiful display of the Victoria  Women's Bookstore, and battlirig my  over-buying tendencies, I came across Katie Curin's book, Women In  China.  I was an easy customer.  Having been an avid reader of Chinese politics and culture for several years now, I feel perennially  frustrated over the~lack of information and analysis on the present  position of women in China.  The  past1, I think, I have a pretty good  picture of.  Women in China is a book that begins,  finally, to address those questions.  Curtin is critical of the pretense  that everything is rosy in China with  respect to the Status of Women. She  is critical both of the ideological  stances used by the Party machinery  to perpetrate thatr and of the uncritical attitude of many Western visitors  towards China.  "(There is)... a tendency among radical Western, visitors  to leave their •'critical faculties be- .  hind when they'visit China simply be- "  cause the revolution, has led to advancement in many areas" (51)  Curtin describes in a very concise and  organized way the processes, the "ups"  and the "downs" of the women's movement in China, tracing the beginnings  from over a century before the Maoist  revolution of 1949. The first four  chapters do deal with history, but try  to put the present status of women in  China in a wider context than just the  pre- and post- revolution situation.  Curtin documents the existence of woman's brigades, feminist journals, and  women's demonstrations in"the late  1800's arid early 1900's; she also shows  low the post-1949 government, in spite  Df its sjupport of the liberation of  women, has.continued to change its position on particular women's, issues when  circumstances make that convenient.  In the second half of Women in China  Curtin analyzes the consequent status  of Chinese women today in the roles  they have in education, in labor, in  politics, and in the family system,  and in the attitudes displayed towards  abortion, birth control, and sexuality.  The position of women in China today  is not equal to'that of men, Curtin  says. Part of the cause,, she admits, .  may be that the economic resources are  not yet sufficient to liberate.women  from a forced choice of homemaker, due  to the lack of such  things as childcare, and communal kitchens. Katie  Curtin puts forward 'the thesis that  scarcity is, however, not the primary  cause., ,The economic equality of women  is as far as the Party.goes in recognizing the liberation of women. A  'woman's right to self-determination in  work and in leisure (life-style) to  non-sex-role stereotyped roles, is not  recognized....sometimes not even by  women of the women's brigades. The  sexual puritanism that is so pushed by  the ideology forces women in a continuously less powerful role than men, by  leaving a woman only the choice of marriage if she is to be sexually active,  and, in so doing, confining her in many  situations to the role of homemaker as.  her primary task. "In general" says '^|||^  Curtin, "there appears to be little consciousness regarding the sexual determination of employment roles." Women may  how. be 'equal' but still thought of  as '.different'.  Curtin shows how this  attitude is reflected in the restricted  roles that women continue to have in all  areas of life, despite the tremendous increase in the amount of involvement of  women in public life since.the revolution.  Women in China is carefully and clearly  written.  It's major short-coming is its  slimness (90pp), due no doubt to a lack  of first-hand data ... which is doubly  regrettable as Katie Curtin certainly  demonstrates that her sharp analysis and  reasoned thinking would have been well  at home with a far more lengthy and detailed work.  Nevertheless, it is a book whichr in  its criticalness of the Chinese Communist Party's 'Sincerity in promoting  feminism, gives us much food for thought  in further questions of political systems (rather than just ideological systems), and how theory and practice  really come together.  - Johanna den Hertog  C3.r?3J.  The Vancouver Abortion Law Repeal  group (CARAL) continues to harry  the deaf men in Ottawa on three  fronts. A few weeks ago the  *;|S^  WOMAN ALIVE1 program on Channel  10 carried a full half hour  discussion by CARAL members on  the inadequacies of the law.  On Oct 19 BCTV broadcast a semi-,  documentary on some aspects of  abortion in Canada. The program  ACCESS was prepared and researched  entirely by Van. CARAL members.  On a second front, CARAL members  are lobbying all MP's in BC on  their knowledge and opinions of  abortion. The results of the  questionnaire are slowly coming in  and will be published in subsequent  KINESIS issues.  (Watch for this,  the ones we have already received  make mind-boggling reading).

'received funding of $7,413  from the Secretary of State Department, Student Community Service Program 1975, to hire three students for  the summer period fr. May 12th. to  September 26th.  The project, entitled "Extending  Visions," had as its objectives:  a) offering younger women the opportunity to explore their potential  b) compiling tapes and films for an  audio-visual library  c) enhancing our organization's  visibility in the communitv.  This outline will be distributed to  teachers and counsellors through the  Vancouver Counsellors Association and  the B.C.T.F. Status of Women Program.  LESLIE McDONALD, coordinated a learning program for young women.  She  held five workshops, on various topics, as a general information exchange and to create interest on a personal level. The response to these  workshops was not as successful as  planned, primarily due to the lack of  activity involvement during the summer  months.  Leslie, nonetheless, acquired  a direction of plan from these workshops and wrote^a panel discussion  outline entitled, "AWARENESS AND LIFE  PLANNING FOR YOUNG WOMEN IN SECONDARY  SCHOOL."  The scheduling of panels for discussion in High Schools will begin this  December. We feel this unique program will be an effective means of informing young women of the realities  of life for women in our society, and  the need, therefore, for young women  to actively plan their lives.  LESLIE DIXON, coordinated the set-up  of the audio-visual library and purchase of audio-visual materials from  a grant of $1,500 from the United  Community Services Program. Leslie  selected 20 WOMAN ALIVE television  shows, covering a wide range of topics, which were transferred onto half  inch audio-visual tapes. These tapes  were catalogued by topic and speakers,,  from which a list was compiled and  published in "Kinesis" as well as  mailed to all the Womem's Groups in  B.C. Already we have received many  requests for these tapes and we see  them as being very valuable resource  material especially in B.C. rural  areas. Two slide series, 'Mattie  Gunnerman' and 'Women in History',  were purchased for the library, and  arrangements for showing can be made  through the office. To build and  update our reference library, Leslie  initiated a system of receiving feminist books from publishers as complimentary 'review' copies. The  formation of the Book Review Group  grew out of this new system. Leslie  has re-organized the V.S.W. library  and a vast amount of resource material is now easily accessible in topic  files. Recently a tape recorder was  donated to the library and cassette  tapes will now be utilized to retain  verbal information.  SHEERA WAISMAN, as public relation  facilitator, designed a poster which  outlines the services and activities  of the V.S.W. One hundred copies of  this two-colour, hand silk-screened  poster were made for school and community displays and will eventually  (hopefully) be displayed on B.C. Hydro  Buses. To assist with visual displays,  at speaking engagements and V.S.W. '  presentations to the community, Sheera  built a folding display board.  Sheera  organized V.S.W.s participation in  'Kit's Day* and, as over 1,500 people  attended, our participation was both  educational and profitable.  Sheera  also designed and cut stencils, made screens for silk-screening  500 t/shirts this summer. The merchandising of t/shirts has proven to be  a simple and direct means of concious-  ness-raising, also bringing in money .  to finance other V.S.W. projects.  Having Leslie Mc, Leslie D., and Sheera  as staff this summer afforded us the  opportunity of having extra womanpower  to realize ideas and implement plans.  Their ideas and enthusiasm constantly  fed into V.S.W. staff meetings as they  participated in all regular staff activities. As well as making three new  friends we have gained three new con-"  tact people as Leslie Mc. is keeping us  informed via her newsy 3-5 page-long  letters from Ontario; Leslie D. is continuing to work on the V.S.W. library  on a part-time basis; and Sheera is  still to do some 'Nellie McClung'  t/shirts.  - Judy Bourne  Photos by Karen Richardson  the avid   articler  CHATELAINE, November/75.

Inside, everything is bright and open  and scaled down — little tables and  chairs, little sinks and toiletsi. The  twenty children who attend the Centre  create a constant, low hum of noise  as they bounce on the trampoline, or  finger paint, or once again dig up the  grapefruit seeds to see if they've  sprouted yet. Some of the most energetic are out running in the rain and  splashing in puddles. Extra sets of  clothing and an automatic dryer elimii  ate damp problems.  There is no feeling of regimentat  ion, but a relaxed involvement  between the workers and the  children. This is partly due  to the fact that the ratio is  one worker to every five child- ■  ren — much lower than the prov-I  incial regulation figure of one  to eight. As Joy Bradbury, one  of the organizers of the Centre  and a member of the Board-of  Directors, states,"Socialization  of children, looking after them well  is the prime function of a day care  centre."  The Board of Directors was determined  that the Centre would not perpetuate  the sex-role stereotyping that is the  root of so many social problems. The  staff, the equipment and toys, the .  books, even the pictures on the wall  were chosen with this in mind. A  ■ sign proclaims /  K*?\.f •  pictures of men and women,engaged in  a variety of occupations adorn the  walls, "The Practical Princess" is  a popular story, and an 'Imagination  Corner' has replaced the traditional  girls' doll corner and boys' truck  corner. These learning tools change  from week to week to reflect the  seasons and holidays and different  interests but the underlying philosophy remains.  The Boat Daycare Centre was registered as a non-profit society in June.  The society received an initial grant  of $2500 from the Department of Human  Resources but all operating expenses  — staff wages, electricity, supplies,-  snacks, insurance, etc.— must be  covered by the fees paid by the parents. It costs $120 a month to send  a child to the Centre, and as many  are single parents,. with limited financial resources, they are subsidized  . individually by the government through  the Day Care Information Centre.  The Board of Directors, which organized the Centre and has acted as a  steering committee, is in the process of becoming a shadow board as  •the running of the Centre is turned  over to a Parents' Board.  The Centre's daily staff of five is  nominally headed by Supervisor Lesley  Field, but operates as a collective  with everyone sharing in the planning  and decisions'.  Only two of the staff are employed  full-time — Lesley who is a qualified Supervisor, and a trained Day  Care Assistant — a position that  requires ten basic courses and a  practicum. Another qualified Super-  —visor and an Assistant each work part-  time. In addition, a man on a Manpower  Training Program who will be taking  the Day Care courses in December works  as a volunteer every day. Another man  works as a VOP volunteer part-time  and one day a week a woman volunteer  comes in to help the new Canadians  with English. For fifteen of the twenty  children at the Centre,English is a  second language.  IBPP  When she officially opened the Centre  in September, the Minister of Consumer Affairs, the Honourable Phyllis  Young stated that the non-sexist policy of The Boat could serve as a  model and precedent for the many  badly needed day care centres in the  province.  The official opening ceremonies, attended by Ms. Young, Alderwoman '  Darlene Marzari, MP Simma Holt, members of the media, and twenty nonchalant  occupants of the Centre, culminated  more than two years of hard work and  organizing by a determined group of  people.  The Staff and Board of Directors feel  that it is important that the children  are cared for by both men and women.  However,there is the problem of finding trained male workers — it hasn't  been considered a particularly socially acceptable profession for a man,  and the wages are not adequate to  support a family. Lesley, a qualified Day Care Supervisor with six and  one-half years experience, who is  currently completing a degree in Early  Childhood Education through the UBC  Extension Department, makes much less  than a government employed child care  worker.  Caring for young children, helping  them to learn and grow, is a demanding  job requiring love and firmness and  endless patience. The amount of training and expertise needed for such a  vital job is not reflected in 4;he  wages paid Day Care workers.  Lesley Field pointed out that more  and more women are entering the work  force — by choice or by necessity.  Their children should have a safe,  familar place where they are cared  for and helped to grow, not just  "plunked in front of a TV set."  parents should have the security of  knowing their children are well-cared  for, and freedom from the nightmare  round of worry and guilt brought on  by unreliable babysitting arrangements  and upset children.  Children should be a priority in our  society and there is a desperate need  for mote places for them like The Boat  Day Care Centre.  - Jo Lazenby  Photos by Bobbie Patrick  IWY  The Vancouver Pioneer Women, a  Jewish women's organization, have  have declared Sunday, November 23  their day to pay tribute to International Women's Year.

The aims of our group  are two-fold:  to promote the personal  growth of members through supportive  discussion and consciousness raising,  and to bring about change in the status of women in the Central Interior  through public education.  Women's Awareness Group is planning a  series of films by the National Film  Board and the Vancouver Peoples Law  School on male/female roles, media  images of women, and women's legal  rights. The first film is scheduled  for late October or early November,  with exact dates to be announced.  Free child care will be provided at  the films to enable women with small  children to attend.  Our group is particularly interested  in expanding the personal and career  ambitions of High School women. We  are arranging the showing of a Canada  Manpower film on job opportunities to  students in the High School. This  film was highly recommended by the  information officers with the International Women's Year van, and according to Canada Manpower officials, has  never before been shown in the Lakes  District. We have also obtained a  promise by the School District 55,  Educational Resource Centre that they  will purchase the Women's Kit for the  High School. The kit contains material on a broad range of subjects,  including women's legal rights, women's history, health and employment  information. We are now in the process  of investigating the most effective way  of presenting this vital information to  the.students.  Two of our members recently attended the  Human Rights Workshop held by the Terrace  Women's Organization. There, they had  the opportunity of hearing speakers  Kathleen Ruff, Director of Human Rights  for the Province of British Columbia,  Eileen Caner, Director of the Women's  Economic Rights Branch of the Department  of Economic Development, and Nancy Conrod,  a lawyer and the president of the Vancouver Status of Women. The Resource  Centre has graciously agreed to purchase  the tapes of these important speeches so  that others may hear them.  Women's Awareness Group is also looking  into the logistics of setting up a women's studies course through the College  of New Caledonia and of establishing an  abortion committee so that area women  could obtain abortions in Burns Lake,  instead of having to travel to Prince  George.  We are still only a small group and we  are always looking for new members.  If  you would like to join us or help in any  of the projects mentioned above, please  contact Jan Denne at 692-3093.  delta  Any women in the Ladner, Tsawwassen,  North Delta area interested in joining a consciousness-raising group?

FUSION - FEMINISM AND SOCIALISM  I wish that I could see a "drift  towards the association of feminism  with socialist politics" as described  in the "Members' Forum" column in  September's "Kinesis". Unfortunately  I feel that very few women have yet  realised such an association as a  viable possibility, and most of us  are still trying desperately to convince ourselves that individual realisation and more education within  the current system is the answer to  centuries of sexism.  I understand and emphasize strongly  with the idea of self realisation and  growth. Women always seem to be on  the outside, nibbling at the real  world, but rarely making much of a  mark.  Some women study, work and  create, but remain effectively powerless outside of a small circle. Most  women feel inadequate and unfulfilled,  despite individual efforts to progress.  This is confusing and frustrating at  best.  Some people can voice their confusion and try to deal with it. Others  feel that there is some indefinable  thing wrong with them..  Some.drift  unconsciously. We learn to feel something less than whole.       &'l£Ss*;l  There is a broad political/cultural ||sfit  influence at work conditioning almost  all people in our society to be defined  (or think of themselves as defined) by  their associations,  e.g., family, class,  profession, education, marital status,  body type, strength, salary, gang, running etc.  People are herded and branded in many  ways, and women have the added burden  of being classified twice - in relation  to the system, and in relation to the  men who control the system. Before any  further labelling is necessary, women  are given a title which defines status  in terms of association with men in a  legal sense.  Many of us are confused about how to  realise the concept of "I am" in conjunction with "we are". A major factor  contributing to this split is that women  are trying to strengthen themselves by  endeavouring, as individuals, to combat  long-standing social mores and systems  formulated and controlled by large groups  such as churches, educational systems,  governmental processes, employment patterns, and companies which control the  economy.  Individual awareness and freedom are essential, but only large groups  of conscious individuals can make even  a dent on the established societal  systems and machines.  Consequently, there is a lack of  cohesive awareness of, and focus  upon, a political solution as a  whole. Instead,we use as a base  the already present individual or  small interest groups to try to  effect minor changes in other individuals (e.g. husbands, MPs) or other  small groups (e.g. unions). A whole  political perspective, in relation  to feminism, has to include awareness, among all classes of women,  of the economic and cultural^exploitation of women as a particular  sector of the majority of people  exploited by the small elite group  owning and controlling most aspects  of society. So, it is not enough for  an individual woman to attain the  dubious glory of becoming a $50,000  a year executive in a society where"  all people are expected to over-  consume and yet struggle to pay- for  shelter and food. This is a system  where it pays the economic moguls  to have half the work population's  output classified as "unproductive"  (i.e. housework), so that the other  half has to work without very much  choice to support both halves of  the population. How free, or just,  is a woman who relies on other women,  of different class, to clean her  house and mind her family, while  she realizes her own individual potential, perpetuating the status quo?  Liberation is an unqualifiable term.  Patchwork and tokenism is no substi-  . -tute.  But in our society, the idea of individual attainment and worth is rammed  down our throats, while individual exploration and creativity are squashed  if they threaten any established institutions or ideas.  So we think that  we are free - free to be the same as  everyone else, to conform.  To make it harder, most of us are  brought up to deny an interest in  politics - a job for "experts". The  current craze to "do your own thing"  helps to ensure that powerful, cooperative groups either don't form or don't  last too long.  So we have our small  groups of feminists, working very hard,  each with its own focus of interest,  calling all women sisters.  But our  groups stay small and separate, and we  go along with the mores of the society  and its controllers who have kept wo-  aen in the position we all know so well.  But, to be neutral and silent is a political stand, so why not make the stand  an active and constructive one?  There are many people (especially women  I think) who are awakening to the new  possibilities in life, chipping away  at the moulds and peeling off the  labels. I think that an understanding  of socialism, and the implementation  of it, is the only logical way to attain true equality and freedom.  Some feminists are trying to explain  this approach to their sisters (and  brothers), but maybe they are not saying it clearly enough, or to the right  people, as so many people still react  negatively to the idea of feminism  through socialism, while talking of  equality and liberation. The common  fear seems to be that we would be replacing male domination with governmental domination, using such conservative institutions as the NDP,  for. example. Socialism is not merely State control of existing establishments and methods of production. Nor is it a bureaucracy of social service handouts. B.C. does not  have a socialist government. Neither does Sweden or Britain (examples  often touted by right wing politicians to show us the folly of veering  too far to the left.) These are State  Capitalist and/or Welfare State systems,     uf'&p?  In countries struggling to build  true socialism in terms of their  own cultures (Vietnam, Mozambique,  Cuba, Guinea Bissau, China,etc) women have made huge strides forward  from their horribly oppressed pasts,  and are continuing, to demand and work  for total equality, able to point  out to all people in their societies  that this has to be, in terms of what  socialism really is. They have leaped centuries in a few decades by being an integral part of the struggle  to free and advance their countries.  There are many straightforward, clearly written explanations of Socialism  available — some of them by feminists.  And Marx's and Engels' own essays often are the clearest. The basic tenets  involve a theory of constant social  change, and cooperative control of  the methods of production and the  resulting goods, by the people who  do the work. I think that these ideas  strike a response in all oppressed  people. The resulting egalitarianism  and self-confidence would leave each  individual human free to control and  use her or his own creative potential  in an uncompetitive way.  - Kay Ryan  vvniten  Is there someone out there who  would like to get involved in |  putting together a book on women'  and poverty?

Canadian Advertising Standards  Council  1240 Bay Street, Suite #302  Toronto, Ontario  Dear CASC:  May we draw your attention to the .  KeepRite Seasonall heating unit ad in  the September issue of "Canadian Building" Magazine. This ad plays on a  double entendre, an image of women  which is insulting.  The woman in this ad is irrelevant to  the product except as an eye-catcher  for what is presumed to be a strictly  male consumer audience.  Women are  tired of being used in any and every  manner to sell products.  The ad implies the only beautiful women are quiet ones and that if not  forcibly gagged, women will immediately  get mouthy. Both these stereotypes are  the product of chauvinist thinking.  They are out-moded myths.  It is disappointing to see a manufacturer conduct itself in such an unbusinesslike manner by promoting derogatory images of women.  Surely they  would not publish an ad showing a black  man gagged because it would be racist.  We suggest that sexist ads are equally  in poor taste.  We commend you for the proposed non-  sexist advertisers guidelines and we  look forward to seeing them with interest. However, unless they are enforceable under the code of adveris-  ing, we do not see that they will be  much use in eradicating sexist ads.  The trend is too long rooted.  On behalf of 900 members of Vancouver  Status of Women in B.C., I would like  to know what at present you can do  about this ad? Thank you for your  attention to this matter.  KeepRite introduces  their quiet  Canadian beauty.

Recently, I read that the Status of  Women was asking women to report any  ads or commercials, which they found  particularly offensive or belittling  to females.  Statements have been flying round lately  about the gains the advertising fraternity Is making as regards the female's  lousy image in advertising. With all  the anger and hostility that females '  have been publicly expressing towards  such ads - no company can be oblivious  to such feeling. Consequently, ads of  this type that still do appear, are a  cold, calculated slap at females in  general. Most companies have stopped  this type of sexist advertising - but  there's always the hangers-on. The  adolescent-jock mentality displayed is  amazing. Regarding the femmes in the  attached ad - there are few things more  embarrassing than seeing individuals,  who are so stupid, as to allow others  to exploit and use them.  I showed these ads to a business acquaintance. His disgusted comment: "Every  industry has these idiots - they never  know when to quit. They make it harder  for the majority who are trying to cooperate and change." It's unfortunate,  but it's obvious it's going to take some  companies a hell of a long time to grow  up as far as the image of the female is  concerned.  Earlier in the year, I had written a  letter regarding their derogatory advertising. They replied, with the usual company statement, saying mine was  the only complaint they'd ever received,  other than one from a young woman in  Victoria in 1972! Their letter stated  they'd soon be changing their advertising and would be including males.  Since  that time their ads, using females only  have gotten progressively worse. As  well as stopping such trash - women are  going to have to push for an investigation into the attitudes and actions  of the ones who are responsible for  accepting such insulting garbage for  newspapers, magazines and television  commercials.

KINESIS:  A£ter receiving permission from my  wife to-read her copy of the October  issue of "Kinesis",  (I have read  others), I feel it is time to write.  First, let me say that T wholeheartedly agree with many of your  programmes dealing with the Status  of Women in society.  I would like  v '«-  to encourage you to continue in your  effors for complete and*total equality.  I also encourage you to continue to  seek out and correct the injustices  done to females by our so-called male  dominated society.  Regarding the article entitled "Men  in the Office," it is stated, and I  quote, "We enjoy the company of men -  at other times and. other places, .and  except for once in a while,' we just  don't want men in the office." "Can  we legitimately be accused of discriminating against them? We think there  are legitimate reasons fo*r maintaining  something that is precious to us."  End of quote.. Yes, you are discriminating, but as a male I don't really  care.  I feel that as an individual  you have.the right to choose who you  associate with and when. You state  you have legitimate reasons but fail  to state what these reasons are, this  failure can cause misunderstanding  and mistrust.  I suggest that had the  situation been reversed, the intruding  females would surely have cried  "foul" and gone running to the authorities complaining of discrimination.  In this instance, it is admitted that  the intruding males understood your  wishes and suggested that it would be }  a "learning experience." The important part here is, "understanding" and  "learning experience." After all,  isn't that what it's all about?  Under the heading of Media Action, you  have published a letter addressed to  the Hotel Vancouver and written by  Karen Richardson.  I do not object to  a protest about advertizing that is  offensive, discriminatory or in bad  taste.  I do, however, object to the  way in which Ms. Richardson writes her  letter of protest.  I suggest to her  that in future she should include with  her protest, at least a creative alternative.  I have read with interest (and some  amusements), your publications and also  talked with some .of your members from  time to time. One point is constantly  brought to my attention.  "Males are  exploiting females as sex objects,"  always as an example, "Playboy" magazine is used. Well, be that as it may,  females enjoy "Playgirl" and I, as a  male, do not feel exploited as a sex  object.  In both sexes, there are  exhibitionists and voyeurs, if they  can please each other and create some  level of happiness for each other, what  is the harm? Who is exploiting who?  It really doesn't matter*  The real issue you should concentrate  on, is to develop for females a total  and complete equality in all areas of  society, that is, equality for opportunities in employment, education,  leisure and life style.  If .you could  channel, your energies, money and talents in the direction of developing a  deeper understanding and a learning  between the sexes, I am sure we will  all be equal and free people with our  own identities and personalities,  living and working together without  one group against another.  I'm sorry to have rambled on so long  but I do thank you for listening.  One last comment: You've come a long  way "Baby," but the" trip isn't over  yet. Keep on driving.  Yours for equality,  William D. Keenleyside  KINESIS:  This, letter will do two things.  First, I want to let you know of  my hearty support of your and of  the sisters in Vancouver actions  demanding a Women's Advocate at the  Canada Manpower office. It was a  terrific thing to do and did a  thing in uplifting my spirits.  Secondly, I want to mention that  the article "Men in the Office" by  Karen Richardson on Page 6 of the  October "Kinesis" certainly clicked  for me.  I would like to add my two  bits. Men and the Women's movement  seems to be one of the touchiest  problems, involved in it. My experience this summer at the Penticton  Women^s Center, brought this home  to me. We had the double problem  of while not particularly wanting  men at our meetings, also feeling'"-,  that We could not exclude them as  this would be a discriminatory act.  The only answer was to subtly discourage their presence.  I should  add here that there was quite a  noticeable difference in the atmosphere and- the openness of the women  at the meetings if men, especially  those who let it be knoVm that they  disagreed with these 'libbers', '  were present. Was it defensiveness  or fear that led us at the Center,  to feel inclined to ban men from  our meetings?  No way L.  Any group of people continually  castigated with irrational condem-  »  nations will become protective of  their opinions simply as a method  of self-preservation.  In the movement one of the hardest jobs is to  compromise our idealism with the  reality of our world.  It's hard and  it's also a drag. This is why so  many women deeply involved in the  movement find themselves drained of  energy after various periods of time.  So to my sisters I believe that in  the area of men and their involvement  in the Women's Movement, we have to  move slowly and carefully. But for  Christ's sake keep the faith.  It is  important to remember that all feminists have the same problem in this  area. Sisters a|| over support each  other. This letter is written out of  love and experience.
