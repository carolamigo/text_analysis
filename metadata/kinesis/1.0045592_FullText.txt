SEPTEMBER; 1994  KINESIS As ti me goes on, you get used to new  years...you know, people say "Happy  New Year. This one's gotta be better,  eh?"...stuff like that. Sometimes it is a  better year, sometimes not.  This year feel different. Almost everyone we came in contact with at and  through the paper this month seems  relieved 1994 is over, more hopeful than  ever that this year will be better. And  there's absolute conviction in our voices  as we say this.  OK, 1994 ivas rough. According to a  brief summary of news covered in Kinesis:  • January 1 st saw the North American Free Trade Agreement taking effect. January 1st also saw the breakout of  the Chiapas revolution in Mexico against  the NAFTA.  • January also saw the signing of an  alleged peace pact between the Israeli  government and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Within months,  most of Palestinians were rejecting the  conditions of the agreement.  • January in BC has the provincial  government enacting welfare-bashing  legislation to cut down on "welfare  fraud."  • By February, women have begun  assessing the final report of the Royal  Commission on New Reproductive  Technologies: the report falls short of  women's expectations. The Philippine  Women's Centre in BC expands. Transition houses workers in Nanaimo, BC,  get their first contract after nine months  of negotiations with the BC government.  • The federal budget in March spells  cuts in UI; freezes or cuts in transfer  payments to provinces for health, education, and welfare; no funds for programs aimed at ending violence against  women; freezes and cuts in funding to  women's centres; and indications that  the Liberals planned to slash social programs.  • March sees the folding of Canada's national feminist health magazine  Healthsharing. In the same month, the  first South Asian Women's Centre  opens in Vancouver; and End Legislated  Poverty in BC starts up a newspaper,  The Long Haul. The BeijingCoodrinating  Committee is formed to prepare Canadian women for the Beijing '95 World  Conference on Women.  • April brings the first multiracial  elections in South Africa and the promise of a socially responsible, anti-racist,  anti-sexist coalition government between  the African National Congress (ANC)  and the National Party (Nats).  ^Thanks  • Meanwhile April in BC sees a  budget with increases only to the ministries of Women's Equality and Aboriginal Affairs.  • In May, the federal government  announcesitwill appeal a Supremecourt  ruling on Suzanne Thibaudeau's cases  that taxing child support payments was  discriminator)'.  • In June, Pandora, Halifax's feminist newspaper folds. A bill that was to  recogn i ze gay and 1 esbi an rel a ti onship s  in Ontario was defeated in a free vote in  the Ontario legislature.  • In August, the right-wing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) are reelected in Mexico following what most  call massiveelction fraud. An estimated  one million people have been killed in  the civil war in Rwanda, which broke  out following the assasination of the  French-backed Hutu president in April.  In Ireland, the IRA announce a ceasefire  with the British military.  • Also in August, the federal government finally agrees to pay Mary  Pitawanakwat $200,000 in compensation for their discriminatory decision to  fire her in 1986.  • In September, Quebec's provincial elections bring the Parti Quebecois  into power. In Cairo, women from  around the world meet at the United  Nations International Conference on  Population and Development. In  Calgary, Communities Against Sexual  Assault opens Calgary's only feminist  sexual assault centre.  • Also in September, students organize a huge protest against Premier  Klein's massive spending cuts in education, health care, family and social  services.  Sergio Marchi announces his 10-year  plan on Immigration which includes  cuts in immigration levels by 50,000; and  restricting the family class of immigrants  • Women's groups, labour and other  socially progressive organizations join  forces to launch a social policy review  fightback-occupying UI offices, holding demonstrations, leafletting malls,  and trashing Axworthy's nationwide  public hearings. Ten thousand students  march on Ottawa.  • Also in November, the South  Asian Women's Centre in Montreal is  burned down; New Initiatives in Film  at the NFB goes national; and RU486  (the abortion pill) undergoes clinical trials in Canada as a cancer-fighting drug.  • In December, Little Sisters Bookstore finally gets to fight Canada Customs (CC) in court for CC's illegal seizures of books slated for the gay and  lesbian bookstore. Women's groups  meet with Axworthy, finance minister  Paul Martin and Status of Women's  Sheila Finestone in Ottawa and outline  their opposition to Axworthy's green  paper of social policy reform.  So does it get better in 1995? Well,  this is the year we're about to get perhaps the most brutal federal (and likely  provincial) budgets we've seen yet.lsee  story facing page]... But that's news for  future Kinesises/Kinesi.

FEBRUARY 1995 News  Women and the 1995 federal budget:  Stay tuned for less  by Fatima Jaffer   As you read this, men in suits sit in  meetings of the Treasury Board making  decisions that will profoundly change  the economic, political and social life of  Canada. Many of their decisions will be  reflected in the upcoming federal budget  and early signs are that the impact of the  budget on women and the working poor  in Canada will be devastating.  At the National Action Committee  on the Status of Women's annual pre-  budget consultation in Ottawa with Finance Minister Paul Martin as Kinesis  goes to press, the country's largest coalition of women'sorganizationshad their  worst fears confirmed.  "We now know that women's inequality is not being considered at all  while he's putting this budget together,"  says NAC president Sunera Thobani.  "There are going to be serious cuts across  the board, including women's programs."  Just more bad news? And what about  the enormous resources socially progressive groups just poured in to ensuring our voices get heard by Human  Resources and Development Minister  Lloyd Axworthy in the Social Policy  Review process that ended in December? Did we waste our time?  A restructuring budget  Almost certainly, the federal budget  slated for February or early March is  expected to continue the process begun  by the previous Tory government of  dismantling Canada's social safety net,  without waiting for Axworthy's report-  back to Parliament on what Canadians  had to say about their social programs.  "It's not a question of Axworthy the  nicer guy versus Martin. Axworthy and  Martin are in cahoots," says Jean  Swanson of the National Anti-Poverty  Organization (NAPO). "Even if  Axworthy's green paper on social policy  reform didn't slice one dollar out of  social policy, it would be a disaster because of the way it restructures social  programs to provide cheap labour."  Thobani agrees: "Budgets are not  about economics; they are about political choices. What we're looking at in the  upcoming budget is an agenda of political and economic restructuring driven  by the special interests of multinational  corporations.  "It's also clear that the social policy  reform we've been consulting with  Axworthy on will be done through the  budget. And as we've seen with the  changes that have already be  implemented,it is the most marginalised  people in society that are the most adversely affected."  Thobani is referring to consecutive  budgets since 1989 which have imposed  consistent cuts to UI benefits, and freezes  or cuts to federal income assistance transfer payments to provinces, to women's  equality seeking groups, among others,  and privatisation of public services. And  like the previous Tory government, the  Liberals have consistently justified cutting spending based on the need to reduce the deficit.  However, a Statistics Canada study  obtained under the Access to Information Act in 1991 shows that it is high  interest rates and tax breaks to corporations that are the cause of the federal  debt, and in fact, only two percent of the  deficit is due to spending on social programs.  "The Tories and the Liberals have  been slashing social programs all along  and thedeficithasn'tbeen reduced. This  budget isn't going to do it either," says  Thobani.  The signs tha t the budget will reflect  the government's political agenda have  been there over the last month. The language the government uses haschanged.  Axworthy has stopped talking about an  employment crisis—we are now apparently facing an "employability crisis."  "In other words, you can't get a job  because you aredoing something wrong;  not because there are no jobs," says Miche  Hill of the Vancouver Status of Women,  who also sits on the executive committee of the NAC.  "So once again, the blame for the  lack of jobs is being put on the working  poor, and we have yet another indication that the Liberals have every intention to continue to renege on the platform of job creation Canadians elected  them on," she adds.  Ellen Woodsworth of Woman to  Woman Global Strategies says the  upcoming budget cannot be analysed by  women "without keeping in mind wht's  happening with governments throughout the world." She cites a familiar  agenda: create "free" markets and sup  port "free" trade policies; reduce deficits; cut social safety nets; privatise public services; weaken labour market regulation; create "flexibility in the workforce;  and keep interest rates high.  "What happens in the US affects  interest rates in Canada; what happens  when we have high interest rates in  Canada affects the value of the peso in  Mexico. Similarly, the impact of what is  contained in the 1995 budget ties in with  the multinational agenda that's pushing  national governments to create conditions that allow the rich to become richer,  and the poor to have no choice but to  become poorer," says Woodsworth.  Cuts to women's funding  In last year's budget, the government made it clear they will be reviewing funding cuts to "interest groups."  Women can almost certainly expect funding cuts to women's organizations that  likely will severely damage our national  "women's machinery." For the groups  who survive the cuts, the budget in 1996  promises toeliminate their funding altogether.  There are also indications that the  Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, a major source of feminist action research, will be dismantled,  and that its research facilities could be  turned over to Sheila Finestone's Status  of Women department. As well, it is  expected that Women's Programs,  through which women's centres get their  funding, will be severely cut and be  Continued page 7  Pro-choice calls for action:  Killings at US clinics  by Edna Campbell   Pro-choice activists are calling for  more protection of abortion clinics after  two women were killed and five others  injured during attacks on three US abortion clinics.  A 22-year-old New Hampshire man  has been charged with murder, after the  December 30 shootings at two clinics in  Brookline, Massachusetts.  Shannon Lowney, 25, a receptionist  at the Planned Parenthood clinic in the  Boston suburb, was shot dead. Three  other women were wounded.  Ten minutes later, the gunman burst  into the Pre-Term Health Services clinic  about two-and-a-half kilometres away  on the same Brookline street. Receptionist Leanne Nichols died later in hospital  from multiple gunshot wounds. Two  other women were wounded.  The wounded women were all employees or volunteers at the two clinics.  A day later, John Salvi was arrested  in Norfolk, Virginia, moments after  opening fire on the Hillcrest Clinic. Although 23 bullets were fired into the  Norfolk clinic (and 50 to 60 people were  inside the clinic when the shooting broke  out), no one was injured.  The Norfolk clinic, like the two  Brookline clinics, was a target of anti-  choice protests, according to Eleanor  Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. She told reporters there  had been a f irebombing, several attempts  at planting pipe bombs, pickets almost  daily, and two occasions when protestors  broke into the building.  Both Brookline clinics re-opened to  see patients within a week of the shootings, after taking increased security precautions, like installing a metal detector.  The shootings sparked a wave of  protests and other actions throughout  Canada and the US.  In Vancouver, pro-choice activists  are calling for "bubble zones" to be established immediately around BC abortion clinics.  Joy Thompson of the BC Coalition  for Abortion Clinics urged a ban on  protests outside the province's three freestanding abortion clinics and all hospitals providing abortion services. She also  called for tougher action from police,  courts, and the attorney-general to uphold civil injunctions and prosecute  protestors outside abortion clinics.  Kim Zander of Everywoman's  Health Centre said death squads have  arrived in North America to terrorize  women using abortion services. She  called on the attorney-general to provide resources promised after Vancouver doctor Garson Romalis was shot in  early November.  "We call on the police and attorney-  general's office to see all protestsby anti-  choice outside our clinic as being in  violation of our injunction and take immediate legal action," Zander said.  There has been harassment at the  Vancouver clinic for the past five years,  she added, including tire slashing,  sidewalk counselling, taking pictures of  clients and clinic staff, chasing clients  and screaming insults at clients [seestory,  page U].  In Boston, about 2,000 people gathered at the state capitol December 31 to  protest anti-abortion terrorism and demand government protection at abor  tion clinics. On January 3, more than a  thousand people participated in a memorial service for the two women murdered in Brookline.  The National Organization for  Women called a protest action in Boston  for January 22, the anniversary of an  American Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.  Within the last two years, threeother  people have been murdered in shootings at US abortion clinics. Dr. David  Gunn was killed outside a clinic in  Pensacola, Florida on March 10, 1993.  Dr. John Britton and bodyguard James  Barrett were shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic on July 29, 1994.  As well, two other doctors who perform abortions have been shot recently:  Dr. George Tiller outside a clinic in  Wichita, Kansas on August 19,1993;and  Dr. Garson Romalis at his home in Vancouver last November 8.  Edna Campbell is a volunteer writer for  Kinesis.  FEBRUARY 1995 News  Community shop seeks buyer:  Women's Work closes  by Eva Novy  There have been several twists and  turns in the evolution of Women's Work  Screen Print & Design Studio over the  past ten years, but this spring marks  perhaps the most critical turning point  for the custom screen print and design  studio.  After 10 years as BC lower mainland's woman-owned, woman-operated  and woman-positive company, co-owners Lori Wall and Carol Weaver are  ness and organizations, donations to  women's groups, working for change in  society by raising awareness through  printed messages and graphics on comfortable clothing—messages ranging  from women's and equality rights to  environmental protection—and ongoing revision of operational policies to  improve the status of women workers  and their families.  Lori Wall, one of the five women  who started Women's Work Screen Print  "as a cottage industry in our kitchens  HuT^  ■^^M'-'P^'^M^.,.  m •.        *    fc i1f"  m  Carol Weaver and Lori Wall at Women's Work  closing shop and putting the business  up for sale.  When asked what prompted the  partners to sell Women's Work, Wall  and Weaver say it was time for a change  that would allow them to pursue personal interests. Women's Work will be  laying off threestaff members—two part-  time printers and a dark-room technician.  For both Wall and Weaver, the decision to close shop has been difficult, and  the women have been encouraging individuals and collectives from within the  women's community to take over the  enterprise.  "Our hope is that the community  will see some way of keeping it within  the community—otherwise what happens is it turns over to the mainstream  market and becomes a shop like all the  others," explains Wall.  What makes Women's Work Screen  Print unlike "all theothers" is a commitment to the concept of a business run by  women for women, first and foremost.  Women's Work provides job training  and non-exploitative employment for  women, sets flexible hours of operation  within the needs of family and children,  and have consistently contributed to the  women's and other alternative communities.  Describing themselves as "Printers  with a conscience," the company's slogan states "we will not print anything  that is racist, sexist, homophobic or  ageist." This policy is reinforced with  special discounts for progressive busi-  and basements," says the initial idea for  Women's Work Screen Print came abou t  in 1984 as a means of funding the Lesbian and Feminist Mothers Political Action Group.  The collective disbanded two years  later and Carol Weaver, then workingas  a designer and production coordinator  on the book cover of Children in Feminism, became Wall's partner.  Moving the operation to North Vancouver, the business expanded from  screen printing of shirts, bags, and towels, to include custom-designed cloth  ing under the name Starprint Design.  Several retail outlets in Vancouver and  Calgary sell Starprint clothing, including Octopus Books and Book Mantel on  Commercial Drive and Dragonspace on  Granville Island.  Perhaps the biggest loss is of a business that has always given back to the  community that supported it. Women's  Work participates in the Community  Economic Development network, are  members of the Vancouver Status of  Women, and network with various women's businesses and groups. In 1991, the  company received the Gay and Lesbian  Centre's Business of the Year Award.  Everywoman's Health Centre, the Women's Program of BC Persons with Aids  Society, and FriendsofClayoquotSound  are just a few of the organizations likely  to feel the loss of Women's Work. And if  it turns into a mainstream screen printer,  the loss will be felt even more acutely.  Bonnie Murray, coordinator of the  Vancouver Lesbian Connection, says she  hopes whoever takes over "will continue to do the kind of work they were  doing., .we really would like to seeitstay  in the feminist community. We also want  to thank them for all the work they've  donated. They really have supported  us—they've been amazing."  According to Wall, who left the pro-  • duction and design end to her partner  while she looked after the business as-  ■ pects of the operation, whoever buys  Women's Work Screen Print will be getting a financially viable, ready-made  enterprise, complete with top-notch  equipment, supplies, and client base.  "It would be very easy for someone  to just step in...we're hoping that maybe  there is some way in which the community can pool money together, to keep  this operating for servicing the community directly."  Although Women's Work Screen  Print is financially healthy, both women  admit it is becoming more difficult for  socially progressive enterprises to survive. Competition is fierce and nowadays even big printers will bid on small  projects, formerly the domain of shops  It's that time of year again.  • Excellent rates on fixed and variable terms  • Instant tax receipts  • RRSP loans available  • No user fees  Deadline: Wednesday, March 1,1995  Come in now, don't wait for the deadline!

To illustrate the point, Carol Weaver  refers to their loss of the contract to print  shirts for the Women In View Festival—  the work went to a lower bidder. "An  all-women's event can't support women's businesses. And if we can't support  each other, how can we survive?"  Raine McKay, a member of the  Women's Health Collective, echoes the  sentiment. "With Press Gang Printers  down last year, and now these guys are  going, unless someone in the community buys it...it's getting harder to find  ways to put money back into our own  community and it's pretty sad."  Women's Work Screen Print and Design Studio is located on East 1st Street in  North Vancouver (just east of Lonsdale  Avenue).

V8K 2C8  FEBRUARY 1995 News  BC Employment Standards Act:  Changes  fall short  by Sue Vohanka  The changes are good as far as they  go, but they don't go nearly far enough  and that's disappointing. That's what  women's groups and unions are saying  about recently announced changes to  BC employment standards laws.  The changes will start to take effect  March 1, almost two years after the  government launched a review of the  laws that set minimum standards for  basic working conditions, like wages,  hours of work, paid holidays and vacations.  The minimum wage goes up in two  steps. The minimum wage will increase  to $6.50 an hour on March 1, and go up  another 50 cents—to $7 an hour—on  October 1.  The lower minimum wage for workers under the age of 18 will be eliminated  as of March 1. Most provinces have  already gotten rid of discriminatory wage  rates for young people, to avoid violating the Charter of Rights.  Coverage is expanded to include  groups of workers among the 140,000  workers in BC now excluded from minimum standards laws. People with disabilities and domestic workers will be  legally entitled to get paid minimum  wage rates, as of March 1.  But farm workers will still be paid  piecework rates instead of a minimum  hourly minimum wage.  "The increase in the minimum wage  is good," says Jean Swanson, of End  Legislated Poverty. "We hoped they'd  be up to $9 by the end of their mandate.  But it'll be good for people to get up to  $7." Swanson is also president of the  National Anti-Poverty Organization.  "It's a major step towards improving the situation of domestic workers,"  says Crisanta Sampang, co-ordinator of  the West Coast Domestic Workers Association. The changes mean domestic  workers will be entitled to hourly minimum wage rates and to overtime pay  after eight hours in a day.  However, the DWA notes the government has not made any provisions to  enforce the law for domestic workers.  Swanson welcomes the government's decision to extend coverage to  people with disabilities, which means  people employed in sheltered workshops will be entitled to the minimum  wage as of March 1. "No more slave  labour disguised as therapy," Swanson  says. "Those things are pretty good."  "You'd never get those things coming out of Alberta," she adds. She points  out that the minimum wage in Newfoundland is still only $4.75 an hour.  "The goalposts are being moved so  far to the right," Swanson says. "The  minimum wage should really be $10,"  she says. "It still has a long way to go to  catch up for all the years the Socreds  froze it at $3.65."  The poverty level for a single person  in Vancouver now is about $16,000 a  year, Swanson says. "If you worked full-  time, a 37-and-a-half-hour week at $7 an  hour, you'd make $13,860."  ure to spend money on* enforcing the  law.  VSW's Hill pointsout that while the  government's decision to extend minimum standards to domestic workers  and homeworkers is positive, it doesn't  mean very much unless the law is enforced. "Without that, those women are  still stuck in their homes without any  protection," she says.  "They're not going far enough with  this. Covering these workers is one thing,  but nothing is going to work unless there  is some pro-active enforcement of the  Act and the regulations."  Hill says the employment standards  branch needs more money to make sure  officers are actively enforcing the law.  "There's still no protection for the  average homeworker, to feel safe," she  says. "No information. How do those  women get access—even if they're cov-  Miche Hill of the Vancouver Status  of Women agrees with Swanson. "Seven  bucks—that's a good start. But we think  it's still way below the poverty line."  "They didn't include the  farmworkers. There's a major problem  there," adds Hill, who is also an executive member of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women.  Hill points out that farmworkers  and other unprotected sectors of the BC  workers will continue to pressure the  government for the same rights as workers covered by the Employment Stadards  Act.  Mary Rowles, legislative research  director for the BC Federation of Labour, praises the increased minimum  wage and criticizes the government's  failure to stop the exploitation of farm  workers.  "The problems are obvious. So's the  solution. End farm labour contractors,"  says Rowles. "Government could be the  contractor."  Instead, labour minister Dan Miller  has promised "more meetings." Rowles  adds, "It's just an unwillingness to take  on the farm labour contractor community. And unless you do that, you just  can't enforce enough to break the exploitation that's occurring."  Rowles sums up the employment  standards changes as "too little, too late."  She adds that it's hard to say what the  biggest disappointment is, but one big  disappointment is the government's fail-  ered under the Employment Standards  Act—to their rights, until it's enforced in  a pro-active way? It's still left up to the  individual woman to complain, and  that's just not good enough," Hill adds.  "Enforcement is just critical," says  Kay Sinclair of Women for Better Wages,  a coalition of women's groups, union  women's committees and individual  women ."If people don't know about the  protections in law, they might as well  not be there," she says.  "The other major disappointment is  they chose not to move on the major  issue of benefits to part-time workers,"  says Rowles of the B.C. Fed. "Pretty  timid. Extraordinarily timid."  Hill and Sinclair both echo that disappointment.  "We're very disappointed that benefits for part-time workers will not be  included," Sinclair says. "We think that's  a really important improvement for  women." Three of every four part-time  workers are women, she adds.  Says Hill: "Considering the direction work is going in this country, to  more part-time work and homework,  you'd think this government would take  this issue seriously enough to provide  some protection to the workers of this  province—the women of this province—  who are getting these jobs.  "This was a golden opportunity to  protect workers in B.C. Considering the  economic climate in this country, they  had a responsibility to do that," she  adds.  Aside from increasing the minimum  wage, Rowles points out the government didn't improve other basic standards under the law, like paid holidays or  vacation time. "We're hardly on the cutting edge," she says.  She adds that one change announced  in late November, a provision for a flexible or compressed work week where a  majority of workers in a workplace agree,  looks like a backward step.  "As a federation, we expressed real  concern about the changes they are proposing to make around the eight-hour  day," Rowles says. "Basically, people  got shot and hung for the eight-hour  day, and they are proposing to do away  with it as a legislated minimum."  So, for most women, there's not a lot  to celebrate, considering the energy and  resources that went into two years of  reviewing employment standards. A  commissioner and a seven-member advisory committee held public hearings  in 13 BC cities, and heard from more  than 600 groups and individuals. Women's groups and other organizations  worked hard on preparing detailed recommendations for the changes that are  needed.  "Such a lot of work, with such small  results," says Karen Cooling, secretary-  treasurer of the Confederation of Canadian Unions. "A so-called labour government should have done better."

Native Women  in the Arts  Native Women in the Arts, a nonprofit organization for Native women  artists based in Toronto, is launching a  magazine to help break down isolation  among Native women artists, support  cultural self-determination, and make  visible the work and activities of Native  women artists across Canada.  The idea for starting a magazine  specific to Native women's art was  borne out of a two-day forum for Native  women artists, Nurturing Our Creative  Vision, organized by Native women in  the Arts. With the explosion of Aboriginal artistic and cultural sectors, and the  many accomplishments of Aboriginal  women, the development of this magazine was seen as an essential service to  the community, as well as an opportunity to bring the talents of Aboriginal  women to the attention of the mainstream.  The first issue, entitled In A Vast  Dreaming and edited by Beth Brant, reflects the lives and creativity of Aboriginal women through short stories, po-  etry, excerpts of plays, biographies, songs  and visual art. This issue celebrates the  work of 46 Aboriginal women artists  from various nations, both well-known  and emerging, including Shirley Bear,  Loretta Todd, Shirley Cheechoo, Shelly  Niro, Marjorie Beaucage, Dana Claxton,  Chrystos and Beatrice Mosionier.  The magazine Native Women in the  Arts will be published on an annual  basis. The managing editor is Sandra  Laronde. The organization also builds  networks for Native women in the arts  to help forge connections and gain access to resources and support.

The Challenge of Diversity,  and takes place May 12-14 in St. John's,  Newfoundland.  The conference plans to reflect upon  the challenges posed to the legal system  and lawmakers by the upheaval in the  outdated narrow social ideal of the nuclear family. There will be a broad range  of discussions on a range of issues including family violence, custody and  access, AIDS and the family and alternate dispute resolution.  The National Association of Women  and the Law (NAWL) is a non-profit  women's organization that has worked  to improve the legal status of women in  Canada since 1974 by promoting the  equality of women through legal education, research, and law reform advocacy.  For further information about the association or the conference please contact  NAWL at Suite 401, 155 Water Street, St.  John's, Neivfoundland, A1C 2B3 or call  NAWL at (709) 579-2595.  Alternatives to  Axworthy's agenda  The government's workbook on social security reform Have Your Say was  presented by Human Resources minister Lloyd Axworthy as a vehicle to help  Canadians respond to the social security  review currently under way. However,  the book has already widely been denounced as biased toward the government's agenda by social justice activists  across the country [see Kinesis, Dec/Jan.  95].  To enable Canadians to have their  say, numerousorganizationshave taken  it upon themselves to produce creative  alternatives.  • Lay It on Lloyd, a publication put  out by the Council of Canadians is intended to offer Canadians a real chance  to say how social programs can be improved, not trashed.  • The National Anti-Poverty Organization offers a cartoon filled workbook that addresses poverty issues not  covered in Axworthy's workbook.  • And in Ottawa, three women have  formed the "Sticking it to the SSR (Social  Security Review) campaign." They offer stickers saying "This workbook does  not work for me," (to save women the  bother of writing that on Have Your Say  themselves, before mailing it back to  Axworthy!)

An evening  was set aside to discuss whether trade  unions should boycott the 4th United  Nations World Conference on Women  which will take place in Beijing, China in  September, 1995.

This is not the first time women's  fund ing has been attacked. In the sp ring  of 1990, the Progressive Conservative  government cut Women's Program  funding by $1.6 million. The cuts were  most damaging to women's centres in  Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova  Scotia, the Yukon, and BC. In BC alone,  almost 80 centres lost all their core funding.  Women's groups launched a full-  scale campaign that included letter-writing, meetings with ministers of parliament and protests outside government  offices, massive demonstrations supported by the majority of the public, and  finally occupations of government offices, where women used the office fax  and phone machinery to set up a meeting with then Secretary of State, Gerry  Weiner. Women won. Funding was restored at 1989 levels. However, since  then, funding levels have been consistently frozen or cut, and a number of  women's groups have been forced to  close.  " 1995 is going to be a year of massive  campaigns that we hope will at least  compare with if not go beyond the effective strategies women used in 1990,"  says Hill.  "It's got to be more than a demo  here, a demo there," she adds. "It'll be  about using every resource we have to  make sure people know the political  agenda behind these cuts and then to  mobilize them to fight."  In anticipation of the cuts, Thobani  says NAC has already planned an Old  Shoes Campaign. "We want women to  send pairs of old shoes to finance minister Paul Martin to send a message that he  shou Id walk in our shoes, before making  any cuts," says Thobani.  Merging Transfer payments  Alsobeingdiscussed isanannounce-  ment that by 1996-97, the government  will merge transfer payments to provinces for healthcare, social services and  postsecondary education into one lump  sum. This will almost certainly affect the  amount and availability of welfare,  through the elimination of the Canada  Assistance Plan (CAP).  CAP guarantees five rights for poor  people: the right to income when you're  in need; theright to income regardless of  what province you're from; the right to  appeal; the right not to have to engage in  workfare; and the right to an amount of  income that takes into account your  budgetary requirements. CAP currently  requires the cost of welfare to be shared  50-50 between the provinces and the  feds and forces provinces to toe a certain  line to get the federal monies.  Says NAPO's Sawnson: "CAP prevents provinces from being too blatant  in using people on welfare for cheap  labour, and that's the main reason they  want to get rid of it. It'll be a disaster for  poor people because CAP is what keeps  the homeless and hunger in Canada below the level that it is in the United  States."  Swanson says that while the elimination of CAP hasn't been confirmed  yet, government inaction on enforcing  CAP shows that it is certainly on the  agenda. "We already have workfare in  Quebec, Alberta and New Brunswick,"  she says, referring to the practice of  forcing people on welfare to take jobs  that pay less than social assistance provides. As an added incentive to both  employers and welfare recipients, the  government has experimented with temporary wage subsidies to convince those  on welfare to take these low-paying jobs.  "In Quebec, the welfare law includes  a line that says employment standards  do not apply to people on workfare,  which makes it more and more apparent  that the purpose of these workfare  schemes is to promote cheap labour and  undercut labour standards and the  wages people already have," says  Swanson.  NAPO will be concentrating on  building a groundswell of public support to fight the economic restructuring  agenda.  "Even if a demo has a hundred thousand people, it won't work. The amount  of organizing and mobilizing and bypassing of the corporate media has just  got to be incredible," says Swanson. She  points out that NAPO has recently broadened its list of the organizations it sends  information to, and has introduced a  Celebrating Black History Month  graphic by new regularly featured graphic  artist/cartoonist Kumvana N'Gomani.  special rate for NAPO membership of  $4.99.

Feds plan cuts to co-ops and public housing  by Michelle Des Lauriers  If you think that Lloyd Axworthy's  plan to gut welfare, UI and post-secondary education are the only attacks being  mounted on low income people, brace  yourself for what could be ahead.  The BC anti-poverty organization,  End Legislated Poverty (ELP), received  a set of working discussion papers produced by the Canada Mortgage and  Housing Corporation (CMHC) for the  National Anti-Poverty Organization.  The working papers, using complex  graphs, language, and manipulation of  figures, come to the conclusion there is  no need for more low income housing.  The papers assume that mixed income  social housing is a thing of the past. Both  Co-op housing and public housing are  on the chopping block.  A letter from David Dingwall, the  Minister in charge of Canada Mortgage  and Housing, to an ELP volunteer confirms ELP's fears. Dingwall says the  government must "seriously question"  using35-year project mortgages and rent  supplement assistance for some units in  social housing projects. Dingwall suggests there is reduced need for social  housing because it's easier for people to  buy homes now.  ELP is working with the Tenants  Rights Action Coalition, housing activist Sheila Baxter, the BC Coalition of  People with Disabilities, and the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association to  fight this federal strategy.  For more information, contact ELP at  (604)879-1209.   Michelle Des Lauriers is ivith End Legislated Poverty.

Lowlights of federal plan to chop social housing:  • Increase rents from 25% to 30 percent of income.  • Adjust social assistance rents to reflect other sources of income (child  tax benefits? GST tax credit? child support?)  • Eliminate certain deductions from gross income (child support?  daycare?)  • Reduce current heating allowance  • Charge residents for additional services (parking? cablevision?)  • Make tenants buy home insurance  • More frequent rent reviews  • Salary reductions  • Charges for transfer to different units  • Sale of units where housing needs no longer exist  • Sale of high value properties  • Move away from targeting lowest income households  FEBRUARY 1995 What?s News  by Lissa Geller  Anti-Racism  Action Centre  Anti-racist organizations in Toronto  have come together as co-sponsors of a  project to establish Canada's first Anti-  Racism Action Centre (ARAC).  TheCentreisbeingsetuptoaddress  the needsof individuals whoexperience  racism, by providing one-to-one support and advocacy as well as community advocacy, training, empowerment,  resource development, and by lobbying  individuals and organizations for  changes.  As well, organizations in Toronto  will have a centre to which they can  direct people requiring information,  advice and support. Working in conjunction with other anti-racist groups in  Toronto, the planned centre is part of a  response system working to eradicate  systemic racism in Canada.  Organizations involved include the  Urban Alliance of Race Relations, Intercede, the Korean Canadian Women's  Association, the Centre for Equality  RightsinAccommodation,andtheCross  Cultural Communication Centre. The  groups have developed the mandate  and activities of ARAC and are currently seeking funding.  Points for  domestic work  "Points for Domestic Work, Points  for Domestic Workers" is the slogan for  a campaign toenddiscriminationagainst  domestic workers who immigrate to  Canada adopted at a recent conference  in Toronto.  The three-day conference, organized  by Intercede, the Toronto organization  for domestic worker's rights, attracted  domestic workers and their allies from  Vancouver, Montreal, Regina, Ottawa,  London, Coburg, and the Metro-Toronto area. Organizations represented  included L'Association pour la Defense  des Droits du Personnel Domestique,  the Ottawa Multicultural Homemakers  Association, the International Caregivers  of Regina, and London Filipino-Canadian Nannies.  Participants made the decision to  work together to achieve equality for  domestic workers under the immigration point system.  Currently, domestic workers' skills  and the need for their work are not  recognized under the immigration point  system. This is one reason why domestic  workers rarely get enough points to enter Canada as independent immigrants  and are forced to apply under the Live-  In Caregivers Program (LCP), which  limits their rights as workers.  "There is clear discrimination against  domestic and caregiver workers in the  way that the immigration point system  is applied against our work and against  us as workers," said Julie Diesta of the  Vancouver Committee for Domestic  Workers' and Caregiver's Rights  (CDWCR).  Intercede and other groups present  at the conference will continue this year  to lobby the federal government to allow domestic workers' training and experience to be awarded pointsand scrap  thediscriminatoryconditionsoftheLCP.  More poor  in Canada  Statistics Canada has released yet  another list of statistics that indicate  more people, especially children, are  living in poverty than ever before.  As End Legislated Poverty's Linda  Marcott points out, it shows the impact  of government policies "that are legislating poverty and concentrating wealth  in the hands of a few.  "This is the kind of society we'll  have if government laws continue to  help the rich at the expense of the poor,"  adds Marcott.  Statistics Canada numbers show that  500,000 more Canadians were living in  poverty in Canada in 1993, bringing the  total to five million compared to 4.5  million in 1992. As well, almost 60  percent of female-headed single parent  households were living in poverty, and  20 percent of Canadian children are  growing up in poverty, up from 18 percent in 1992.  As Marcott points out, "this information comes only two weeks after the  Canadian banks revealed their obscene  profits... of nearly $4 billion each for the  big five banks...."  Hate crime  bill plods on  Bill C-41, known as the Hate Crimes  bill, passed second reading in the House  of Commons on October 18, and is expected to be high on the list of items to be  discussed in its final and third reading  as parliament opens this month.  The bill caused a stir among Reform  MPs and at least two Liberal MPs  (Roseane Skoke and Tom Waddell) for  its requirement that judges take into  account the motivation of the crime when  sentencing. Specifically, they are opposed to the definition of attacks on  lesbians and gays as a hate crime. If the  crime was motivated by homophobia,  the judge is entitled to impose a longer  sentence on the criminal.  This bill marks the first time that the  words "sexual orientation" appear in  federal legislation and is considered an  important step in addressing  homophobia and hate crimes against  lesbians and gays in Canada.  The bill stirred up hatred in the  Houseof Commons, forcing Justice Minister Allan Rock to defend his government's protection of gays and lesbians.  Lesbians and gay men are being  encouraged to write to the Justice Committee about hate crimes against them  on the basis of their sexual orientation.  Write to: the Chair of the committee:  The Hon. Warren Allmand, PC, MP, Chair  of the Standing Committee on Justice and  Legal Affairs, Room 102, East Block, House  of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario. No stamp is  needed.  New Brunswick  targets teen moms  Teenage mothers in New Brunswick  are the targets of the New Brunswick  government's recent welfare-bashing  changes.  Legislation introduced in December will require teen mothers to take  parenting classes and to stay in school if  they want to be eligible for welfare. The  legislation, which forces them into school  regardless of their circumstances and  does not address the fathers' responsibilities, is part of wide-sweeping social  policy reforms in New Brunswick introduced late last year.  "I would suggest that the best course  given to any young woman who finds  herself in [the situation of being a single  parent] is, first off, surviving on the  lowest income-assistance rates in  Canada," says NDP opposition leader  Elizabeth Weir.  Weir then pointed to the government's lack of commitment to adequate  sex education, programs at reproductive health centres and a free standing  abortion clinic in the province. All of  these indicate a lack of commitment on  the government's part to addressing the  problem in its entirety, she says.  Funding  Race Relations  The Liberal government is expected  to announce the creation of a $24 million  Canadian Race Relations Foundation in  Toronto to study and address racism in  Canada.  Although the exact mandate of the  Foundation has not been announced, it  is expected to be the only new progressive agency created next year by the  Liberal government which is cutting  spending in most areas.  Anti-racistgroupsand organizations  and their allies have been slow to support the new Foundation, largely because the Liberal government's other  initiatives thus far—for example, those  regarding immigration—have been racist and exclusionary.  As well, Reform Party MPs have  called the proposed project "frivolous  spending" and will likely protest the  project's implementation.  Sexist remarks from  judge in Nova Scotia  Women's groups in Nova Scotia  were outraged at remarks made by a  judge when sentencing a man to prison  for sexually assaulting three girls.  Judge Donald Matheson of Glace  Bay sentenced a man to three months in  jail for sexual assault involving two 15-  year-olds and a 12 year-old. During his  sentencing remarks to the court, he noted  that if the incident had occurred between the man and a mature woman, he  "might smile and throw this out of  court."  Bonnie Nicholson, a public educator on family violence, said the judge's  remarks show the urgent need for education and sensitivity training for the  judiciary. Meanwhile, the judge, who  has apologized for his remarks, is under  investigation by the province's chief provincial court judge.  False Memory  Syndrome  Ellen Bass and Laura Davis, who  were sued for their books, The Courage  To Heal and The Courage to Heal Work-  book, have been vindicated of the lawsuit  brought against them.  A municipal court judge in California has dismissed the case against Bass  and Davis by reaffirming their right to  share what they have learned about surviving sexual abuse and the healing  process.  The case was initiated by a member  of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, whichclaims that child sexual abuse  memories are implanted by therapists  and others hoping to create a "therapy  industry" of women who need their  counselling. The suit alleged that Bass  and Davis were guilty of "false advertising" and wrote their books with the  intention of inflicting emotional distress  on an entire class of people.  Although the judge has found in  their favour, the legal bills for Bass and  Davis are still mounting as the Foundation prepare for appeal. Because of this,  supporters of the authors have created  the Courage to Heal Defense Committee.

Many full-time home  managers felt insulted, devalued, and  angry. So angry, they started a grassroots movement and launched the Work  is Work Campaign to change the work  section on the 1996 census so it becomes  what it claims to be—a measure of all  the work done in Canada.  According to Statistics Canada  (StatsCan), censusdata is "the principal  source of information for measuring  social and economic change and for  detecting those needs which necessitate the development and implementation of policies and programs."  The assistant chief statistician at  StatsCan refered to the census as a "cornerstone" in Canada's social statistics  program. Canadian women's unwaged  work is not in this database because,  according to current economic theory,  if it's not waged, it's not work.  If unwaged work is not included in  these numbers, the needs and concerns  of unwaged workers are not included  in policy discussions. In this most recent round of discussions about cutbacks on social services and fighting the  deficit, it matters a great deal what  policies are cut, what public monies are  not spent on care for the elderly and  health care. Who is going to pick up that  care? It's not going to go undone. It will  be done by people, mostly women, voluntarily..  Household work is work most  women do: we've all heard of the double shift. StatsCan estimates the total  value of unpaid household work performed by all Canadians to be between  $284.9 and $318.8 billion in 1992, de-  pendingon the method of costing. They  also estimate that women contribute  about two-thirds of all hours spent on  housework. These figures do not include volunteer work, of which women  comprise the majority of workers in the  health, education and social welfare  fields.  Women worldwide are doing more  than their share and getting little in  return. According to an International  Labour Organization study presented  at the 2nd United Nations World Conference on Women, held in Copenhagen in 1980, women constitute half the  world's population, grow half the food  and labour two-thirds of the working  hours. In exchange, we receive one-  tenth the wages and own a mere one  percent of the world's property. A crucial factor in the perpetuation of this  global economic system is the invisibility of women's unwaged work.  Marilyn Waring, New Zealand  economist and author of If Women  Counted, cites the major reason unwaged  work remains uncounted as due to the  United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA), evolved during the  1940s and early 1950s to measure the  market economy. To this end, definitions were designed to exclude all  nonmarket activity: work is only work if  money changes hands; child care workers are occupied; mothers who care for  their own children are unoccupied; and  so on. The result? The economic contribution of women's unwaged work is  neatly rendered invisible.  While UNSNA is only a subset of  total economic activity, it is often assumed by users of the statistics, including policy-makers in government, that  the market economy is the whole  economy. Asa result, the contribution of  unwaged workers is omitted from the  StatsCan tested questions for the  1996 census in November 1993. Questions on unpaid work were not the only  ones tested. Some of the other areas  included linguistics, ethno-cultural origins, and a question asking for the main  mode of transportation used to travel to  work. The results were published in  August 1994.  Based on the test results, on consultations with StatsCan data users concerning their information requirements,  and on past experience, StatsCan developed questionaire options for consideration by the federal Cabinet at the end  of 1994. The Cabinet has the final say.  L-R: Teresa Gehman of Mothers are Women and  Barbara Little of BC Voice of Women at Network '94  credit side of our national ledger. As in  any equation, there are two sides: if  you're not seen as contributing on one  side, you won't be seen on the other  when it's time to distribute the benefits.  Just ask any of the thousands of older  women living below the poverty line.  These women are poor not because they  never worked, but because the work  they did was never valued and counted.  Lorraine Michaels, a member of  National Action Committee on the Status of Women's (NAC) Future of Women's Work Campaign, comments on the  further implications of devaluing women's unwaged work. "When we look  specifically at women's traditional work  in the home, devaluing that work also  affects women who work in the formal  workplace," she says. It is no coincidence that child care workers are the  lowest paid occupational group in  Canada.  Four of the organizations sponsoring the Work is Work Campaign are the  NAC, Canadian Alliance for Home  Managers (CAHM), Mothers Are  Women (MAW), Women to Women:  Global Strategies, and BC Voice of  Women. The campaign is also endorsed  by, among others, BC NAC, Gloria  Steinem and Judy Rebick.  At the NAC annual general meeting  in June 1994, CAHM put forward a resolution to boycott the work section of the  1996 census if questions on unwaged  work were not included. It passed overwhelmingly.  Concerned that John Manley, Minister for StatsCan, and that Cabinet  would consult only with StatsCan on  this issue and not give equal time to  those presenting an opposing view,  members of the Work is Work Campaign  prepared a brief. Called "Census Inclusion of Unwaged Work," it was distributed to all MPs.  As well, a postcard mailing campaign was initiated. Addressed to John  Manley, the postcards demanded  StatsCan "Count Unwaged Work."  At the recent Network'94: Home Management and Family Care Conference in  Saskatoon, Nettie Weibe, former Woman's president of the National Farmer's  Union and writer, panelist and speaker  on agriculture and trade issues, said, "In  this industrialized society, we're wedded to the view that scientific and quantified data describes reality. Numbers  determine the facts. The rest of it is soft  in some way, not real information. In  this context, to be uncounted is to be  discounted."  Barbara Little, a member of BC Voice  of Women, gave examples of the further  discounting of "women's work." The  Canada Pension Plan has been amended  to include a "child-rearing drop-out provision." Little read from the Income Securities Office information sheet: "This  [being temporarily out of the paid labour force] was a disadvantage to some  people, usually working mothers, who  stayed at home to raise young children.  Often, mothers stopped working all to  gether or worked only part time during  this period..."  Little then talked about women on  maternity leave who receive unemployment insurance benefits. These mothers  are required to fill out a report card  every two weeks to prove their eligibility. There are five questions, two of  which are:  "1. Did you work during the period  of this report?"  Little explains: "You have to answer  no in order to qualify to receive benefits.  We...require the prime minister tochange  the wording to say, 'Did you earn any  wages during this period?'"  "4. Were you ready willing and capable of working each day?"  Again, Little explains: "To receive  benefits the woman must again answer  no. She must lie. This must be reworded  to read, 'Were you ready willing and  capable of earning money each day'?"  By the end of the conference, AFE AS  (Association Feminine d'Education et  d'Action Sociale), a Quebec group representing 25,000 women, had joined the  campaign.  Canadian home managers believe  their fight to value what has historically  been "women's work" is crucial to the  success of women's struggle for choice  and equality. They are no longer willing  to be silent and invisible.  "When we look at how we are treated  in the income tax system, pension system, child care debate, and national statistics, we see we are literally excluded,"  Carol Lees, a member of CAHM says.  "This lack of recognition has kept us  voiceless and powerless." Until now.  Saturday afternoon, at the Network  '94 Conference, Lees popped open a bottle of bubbly—ginger ale, that is—to  celebrate the publication of the resultsof  the census test questions. While the test  results indicate that many of the  StatsCan's past objections to including  questions on unwaged work on the census have been overturned by their own  testing, women involved in the Work Is  Work is Work Campaign say they will not  assume success. After all, StatsCan has  been testing questions on unpaid work  since the 1970s.  Lees poured the ginger ale into a  plasticcup."Wearenotconfidentenough  to be using crystal glasses and champagne," she said. Raising her glass to the  crowd, she smiled, "We hope the next  time we get together, it will be the real  thing."  Those involved in the Work is Work is  Work Campaign seek others to join them.

FEBRUARY 1995 Feature  Violence against women:  To shred or not to...  by Bonnie Agnew  Sexual assault is about and is a result of  the inequality of women. Sexual assault law  and its application therefore should be about  the correction of this inequality. But is it?  Women's access to the courts  Despite heavy resistance from police, crown, judges, and professional accrediting bodies across the country, Canadian women have long petitioned the  legal system for their right to report  crimes of male violence against them.  In 1991, there were some 30,000  sexual assaults reported to police in  Canada—a 90 percent increase over  1984. While this number is low compared to the actual number of rapes in  Canada in any given year, civil, criminal  and family courts, as well as colleges of  professionals are facing unprecedented  numbers of reports of sexual assaults on  women and children. Public scrutiny of  their handling of these cases is unprecedented and public dissatisfaction with  the outcomes has never been higher.  The level of public tolerance for  defenses of being too drunk or stoned or  of sleep walking, and for judges granting stays instead of legal decisions of  guiltor innocence is hitting rock bottom.  It is unlikely then that a distrustful public will believe the latest blame-fixing  coming from defense lawyers and  judges: that feminists and feminist organizations are responsible for men accused of violence against women being  released from charges because of what  has become a nationwide, grass-roots  waveof pro-woman civil disobedience—  the refusal of rape crisis centres and  transition houses to comply with subpoenas and turn over to the courts confidential records of women clients.  Most women who have been assaulted do not make a complaint to the  police. A large number of those who do  never see the inside of a courtroom despite their willingness to testify, make  their medical records relating to the rape  available to the court, and be cross-  examined on this evidence. They don't  make official complaints because police  fail to investigate their report fully, or  because the crown prosecutor doesn't  think there is enough evidence to proceed to trial.  So the women whose rape cases  have proceeeded to trial have already  beat the odds against getting there. Those  men who are charged and proceed to  trial not only have a lot of legal evidence  assembled against them, they are being  prosecuted by a police department and  a crown counsel office unified in their  belief that the case i s winnable. These are  the cases we read about in the newspapers. These are also the cases at the core  of the struggle about shredding transition house records.  Document Disclosure  Increasingly over the last five years  and with a vengeance in the last three,  many defence counsels in criminal and  civil cases and even in tribunals have  issued subpoenas requiring women's  records. The woman herself receives orders for her own diaries; therapists, psychiatrists, government departments of  child and family services, and now rape  crisiscentres and transition houses have  all been served with requests for the  woman's confidential records. In criminal cases, these subpoenas are often sent  after the man has been charged, but  before his trial begins. [These records  effectively tables a woman's life and  past sexual history as evidence.] This  appears to be an effort to go around all  the existing, however limited, protections afforded women by sexual assault  law in Canada [to not have their past  sexual history made an issue of]. These  protections apply in criminal trials,have  unclear application pre-trial and no application in civil and tribunal hearings.  In the 1992 Regina versus Bender case  in Ontario, the accused admitted that  sex did take place, but claimed the  woman consented. The man's pre-trial  defence counsel was able to obtain subpoenas for records from all rape crisis  centres, medical and psychiatric facilities within a geographic radius. He was  looking for "any indication that the  woman complainant had made previ-  ousallegationsofsexualassault—against  anyone." Is this not perilously close to a  suspiciously sexist fishing expedition?  So what would he be likely to do  with any information he did find out?  The president of the Canadian Criminal  Lawyers Association, Brian Greenspan,  recently helped confirm our speculations. "[Defense lawyers are] looking for  three things: she may have told a different story to the different places" (read:  women lie); perhaps "theallegation was  prompted or fashioned or assisted or  compelled by the therapist" (read: she's  not very bright and therapists are vengeful manhaters); and further "it may raise  questions about the emotional stability  of the woman" (read: she's delusional,  or everyone knows men can rape women  with mental or emotional instabilities  and get away with it).  This practice of subpoening records  is now so pervasive that dozens of rape  crisis centres and transition housesacross  the country are in receipt of them. The  range of what defense counsel is requiring in subpoenas is wide. Some want the  notes taken by the woman's advocate  during appointments with the woman  complainant. Some want lists of all incoming phone calls to the centre. Some  want all records on the woman the centre may have, including any previous  attacks relating to the charge at hand.  Some want records of the members and  discussions in her support group, and  others want all records of all callers to  the centre over a particular four-month  period.  The complainants in many of these  cases are from some of the groups of  women who suffer the most male violence buthave previously been thegroup  most denied access to the justice system:  Native women, women with mental dis-  abilities and young working-class  women.  Seven years ago in Vancouver, we  did not have Vancouver city police officially and routinely asking women, particularly in the Downtown Eastside, who  were trying to report cases of sexual  assault, to sign a release form authorizing "any doctor, or other person...to  furnish any information, opinions, reports, records..." about them to the police before they would investigate the  man she named. Rape crisis centres and  transition houses were not served with  search warrants or subpoenasby defense  cousel. And although seven years ago  women did not get fair trial process, we  did not hear defense counsel objecting  that the accused was not able to make a  full answer and defense.  I am aware of a single case in which  an innocent man was jailed on sexual  assault charges. While I point this out, I  do not mean feminists are taking lightly  the arguments made by defense in this  struggle. Rape crisis workers have no  interest in jailing innocent men or in  denying any accused a fair trial. We are  well aware that the jail population has  been disproportionately made up of the  least advantaged men in the society. We  are aware that most of these groups of  men are not the most responsible for  crimes of violence against women. We  do note thatlhese were the men on trial  when the defense lawyers were silent on  the question of fair trial.  As rape crisis centres and transition  houses have been receiving these legal  orders, responses have necessarily varied. But in general, the unwillingness to  comply is common and obvious from  Nova Scotia through Ontario to BC. Resistance to this escalating attack on women's agency is being taken only by those  who have historically worked to advance women's liberation: feminists and  women's advocacy centres. Therapists,  psychiatrists, mental health workers and  government agencies comply when ordered, unless they are feminists.  Women's advocates working against  violence against women have been quick  to recognize this technique as an attack.  They see subpoenas as tactics intended  to capitalize on and entrench rape myths  and myths about women. The sexism  frequently heaped on the woman complainant has now been viciously extended to those who are challenging  compliance orders. Grass-roots women's advocates, feminist lawyers and  feminist therapists who dare to stand up  to this bullying are being openly called  man-haters, feminazis, fools and incompetent.  Recently three Ontarioappeal judges  ruled that the documents of the Sault  Ste. Marie rape crisis centre should have  simply been "seized" at trial. As well,  rape crisis workers in several locales in  Ontario have come under investigation  themselves for fraud and obstruction of  justice.  Judicial rulings in these subpoena  challenges have been inconsistent with  both defeats and victories only temporary as all are open to appeal. Sometimes  shredding the records, or finding no  records has resulted in a dismissal of the  sexual assault case entirely, and sometimes it hasn't.  By challenging these "legal" techniques, rape crisis and transition house  workers are trying to protect the woman's (and all women's) entitlement to  speak to whom she chooses. They are  also trying to protect her entitlement—  not only to privacy or to confidential  "therapy," which are thus far the only  arguments courts have allowed to be  heard fully, but "to a fair trial process in  which she is treated as an equal and not  subjected to every myth and stereotype  about women, racial groups of women,  disability groups of women and classes  of women," as Lee Lakeman put it in  Disclosure in Sexual Assault Cases.  Women's advocates in rape crisis  centres and transition houses are trying  to do three things:  • protect a woman's entitlement to  use Canadian courts;  • force the court to deal with the  evidence that is already willingly documented, available and substancial  enough to order the accused to trial;  • force the court to make a legal  decision on theman'sguiltor innocence.  Even if what we were up against  was only what is known as "disclosure  law," I couldn't agree more with the  point UBC law professor and LEAF  member Christine Boyle raised two years  ago: "the impact of disclosure law on  sexual assault trials is a time bomb that  has now exploded."  How do we move from here?  I believe it is necessary to continue  to fight this struggle and continue the  drive for women's entitlement to the  court system. I also believe we need to  continue the pressure until the current  crisis in the justice system is resolved in  favour of equality for women. No doubt  this struggle is having an effect. While  the law seems to leave rape crisis centres  and transition houses little choice but to  continue this campaign of civil disobedience, we are engaged in a social and  political struggle.  The publicity has drawn both feminist and public support. All three major  newspapers in BC have sided with us in  editorials. After considerable feminist  pressure and massivecivil disobedience,  and with public support, the federal  justice minister has made a public statement regarding a need for legal relief for  rape crisiscentres. Whatshape this takes  will have to be defined by those centres.  There remains a resounding silence  from our Attorney General in BC and  officials in other provinces who have the  authority to intervene on behalf of women's equality in this area. Increased feminist and general public support is still  vital and necessary to force the criminal  justice system and governments to advance women's equality.  Bonnie Agnew is a rape crisis worker in  Vancouver.  FEBRUARY 1995 Feature  Harassment and intimidation at Vancouver abortion clinic:  The war on women  by Kim Zander  You've probably seen this story in  the media, but you should know the  whole story from the perspective of the  Everywoman's Health Centre (EHC).  To protect people, names and positions  have been changed or omitted.  We believe that the shootings and  murders at abortion clinics in North  America could have been prevented, if  only law enforcement agencies had listened to the warnings. How much more  intimidation, how many more deaths  will it take for police and governments  to wake up?  A Special Meeting  Sheila, an EHC staff member, begins  to tell the Clinic's story to a "person in  authority"(X). She is accompanied by  three others; two clinic staff members  and myself, a clinic board member.  "The licence plate issue says it all,"  she explains.  Reports to the Police  Sheila explains how the anti-choice  have been gathering licence plate numbers for years, and how the Vancouver  police have been notified several times.  On January 28th, 1994, staff observed  leader John Hof, BC President of Campaign Life Coalition, taking licence plate  numbers and reported him. The attending officer asked Hof if he had been  doing this. Hof said no. The police  walked away.  On at least two occasions, clients  called the clinic very upset and angry.  The anti-choice had contacted them and  confidentiality between themselves and  family had been breached.  In early 1994, two EHC staff members were contacted by the anti-choice,  one by mail, the other by phone. Neither  address nor phone number was publicly  registered. As usual, these suspicious  incidents were reported to the police.  Sheila requested police licence plate files,  hoping to find how the breach of personal information happened. No commitment was given. No action was taken.  In early October, at his trial for contempt of court, a prominent anti-choice  protester Gordon Watson admitted under oath that he paid lots of money to get  information on license plate numbers he  gathered from the clinic. Immediately,  Sheila spoke to crown counsel and a  Vancouver police representative.  "We thought, surely they must take  us seriously now! This anti-choice protester has been increasingly vitriolic and  violent and has called for the death sentence for those providing abortion services. This admission was just after the  murder of Dr. Britton and James Barrett  in the US. We felt sure they would see  theconnection to the issues of security."  Sheila emphasizes. "Why else do the  anti-choice want our addresses?"  She reminds X that "our clinic and  the BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics  held a press conference in August 1994  to make the public aware of the escalation in violence. The police weren't taking us seriously. We feared a murder  here in Vancouver. We wanted an immediate investigation into the activities  of the anti-choice. Shortly after that, on  August 18th, the provincial government's Task Force on Contraception and  Abortion called for the same investigation."  EHC Still Ignored  I watch with appreciation as Sheila  continues, almost every detail committed to memory, and well documented. X  listens carefully and respectfully. He's  only recently gotten involved. Although  he remains calm through Sheila's report, he seems amazed at the experience  of the clinic.  After the trial in October, crown  counsel asked us to give them two weeks  before we act on the licence plate numbers. A month went by without a word.  Anna, another staff member, speaks up.  "There have been many incidents of  harassment at the clinic. Therehave been  times when we just didn't bother calling  the police. Their attitude was we were  making a mountain out of a mole hill; we  were getting hysterical and overreacting; that our calls were about insignificant things. After six years, we stopped  expecting much from the police."  She continues with exasperation,"  but, when this [Gordon Watson's admission he gathered license plate numbers] was openly admitted in court, we  thought for sure the police would do  something."  We Won't Stand Idly By  On November 8th, Dr. Gary Romalis  was shot at his home in Vancouver and  nearly bled to death. The police haven't  kept EHC informed about the Romalis  investigation, even though we believe it  is linked to security issues at our clinic.  EHC staff and volunters decided we  won't sit still while our security is at risk.  We made a Freedom of Information (FOI)  request to ICBC (Insurance Corporation  of BC)—have any enquiries been made  on the plates of clinic staff? We suggested a window of only a few days for  each plate, when we guessed a search  might have been requested. It was like  looking for a needle in a haystack. We  gave them only eight licence numbers of  staff and volunteers, those already  known by the anti-choice, to ensure no  others were at risk of identification  through this inquiry. We trusted no one.  We submitted our FOI request in mid-  November.  Bingo!  The ICBC FOI officer, the most respectful and helpful official we have  dealt with up to this point, called on  December 6th. Three of the eight licence  plates had been searched in a suspicious  manner in a Delta police request. The  ICBC FOI officer had already contacted  the RCMP, because the request went  through their computer system. We informed the FOI office that a police officer who lives in Delta is involved with  an anti-choice organization called Campaign Life. Might there be a connection?  The FOI officer agreed to pass this fact  on the the RCMP.  Again, the clinic staff waited. Mid  December, Sheila wrote to crown cousel  asking him if anyone had been assigned  to investigate the license plate issue, and  i f so, who, and if not, why not. Again, the  clinic waited. No reply from anyone.  Then came the Brookline, Massachusetts murders in the US on December 30th [see page 3]. EHC and the BC  Coalition for Abortion Clinics (BCCAC)  held a press conference at which they  expressed their horror at two more  murders—this time of clinic workers—  andgunshotwoundstofiveothers. Both  groups called for immediate law enforcement and government action inBC,  and for the long-demanded investigation into anti-choice harassment. A new  demand is added for a buffer zone  around free-standing clinics. We cannot  afford to take chances with the anti-  choice protestors anymore. Their purpose has always been to terrorize  women, and has nothing to do with free  speech.  Fed up and outraged by the lack of  action in BC, our Security and Media  Committee decided to give the licence  plate story to a media contact. The public has to know, and pressure has to be  brought to bear on the police and government before there is yet one more  murder. We asked the reporter to hold  on for a few days until we cleared some  things.  A letter dated December 30th was  sent to EHC by crown cousel. Finally a  response to our letter about the license  plates! Evidently, the author doesn't  believe this is a significant issue. No  action has been taken, none has been  planned.  Media Enquiry Causes Action?  The reporter went ahead with the  story and contacted people in positions  of authority. Suddenly we heard of action! EHC found out that the RCMP  contacted the Delta police for the first  time on January 4th to begin an investigation on the license plates. This is a  month after the RCMP were first contacted.  "To this date," Sheila says with disbelief, "no one from the RCMP, Vancouver police, or crown counsel has contacted our clinic about the license plate  investigation. What else would they  uncover if they did their homework?"  She adds,"The Attorney General set  up this Criminal Harassment Unit to  research and report on the problems of  criminal harassment by the anti-choice,  among others. We have recently been in  contact with representatives of those  organizations that provide services in  Vancouver. Do you know that not one of  them had been contacted by the Criminal Harassment Unit for information as  of Tuesday, January 10th!"  "The problem is political will," I  add. "The police call it not wanting to  'take sides'. They view the clinic as one  of two extremes in a political debate  about choice. Yet, when the police have  been called to an action at EHC, they  have taken sides. They have refused to  uphold the law." I want X to understand  that the police have exposed their reprehensible politics.  What's Next?  Sheila continues, "It's only when the  media got involved that police acted.  After all our years of gathering information and trying to pass it on to the police,  now they want our research. All of a  sudden it has value."  X is genuinely horrified. As the first  person in authority who has taken the  time to hear the whole story, he can't  believe the lack of communication with  us, the lack of co-ordination among law  enforcement agencies, and the lack of  action on our concerns.  The other EHC staff member speaks  up. "Were you aware that the anti-choice  in the US wrote in one of their magazines, Life Advocates, that they found the  identity of doctor John Britton [who  replaced the murdered Dr. Gunn at the  Pensacola clinic,] through a licence plate  search? After that, he was repeatedly  stalked, harassed and finally murdered."  Clearly, American police, like their  Canadian counterparts, also have been  dismissing warnings about anti-choice  violence.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  Security hardware and law enforcement  action are only part of the answer. Changing the political climate is key [see boxj.

FEBRUARY 1995 Black History Month:  Telling it like it is  by Jillian M. Dixon, Titilola Adebanjo,  Marie-Jolie Rgwigema Didas Gemeni,  and Tovah Leiha Dixon  as told to Toni Goree and Fatima Jaffer   February is Black History Month in North America, a  time to celebrate the histories of people of African descent.  Four young Black women came together last month to share  their thoughts on Black history. Titilola Adebanjo ("titilola  means 'forever my wealth') is 15 years old ivith two  supportive parents; Marie-Jolie Rgwigema Didas Gemeni is  12 years old; she is an Ethiopian-born Rwandan, she lives  with her mother who is separated and an olderbrother; Tovah  Leiha Dixon is a 15-year-old from Halifax; a Virgo, she lives  with her mother, two brothers and three sisters. Jillian M.  Dixon is 19 years old, moved to Vancouver six months ago  from "a lot of places," and is happy her family has taken her  back in.  Toni: What's it like for you as young xuomen of colour  living in Vancouver?  Jillian: It's really nodifferent than any where else in  Canada, except there are very few Black people here.  I'm from Nova Scotia where there are several Black  communities. It's frustrating here.  I work with these hippie-wanna-be white people  who don't understand me. I'm the only one  who wants to have unlearning racism workshops, and the only one who knows why that  should happen.  Tovah: It's pretty difficult for me because  nobody sees me as a woman of colour—I'm  light-skinned. People think I have an advantage, but I don't see it that way. I was raised by  my mom who's Black and I know what it's like  for her. When we lived in Pictou County where there  are lots of white racist people, I was a "Nigger." But  when I go to places where there are [only] Black people,  they think I'm not Black, I'm white.  Even though I'm mixed, people treat you differently. When I walk down the hall, the guys say,  "Whoomp, there it is," [meaning] my butt and I hate it.  They say that to me because they know I'm Black. They  would never say that to a white girl.  It's also weird with the girls. White girls will touch  my hair and say, "it's like your hair's got grease in it,  yuck." Black girls will say, "You don't got to put  nothin' in your hair girl, you got nice hair, your hair  isn't all that kinky." But that makes me feel like people  are trying to deprive me of who I am.  Marie: Vancouver's a lot different from where I  used to live, too. I was born and raised in Ethiopia, and  everybody was Black there, so who are we going to be  racist to? I've met with a lot of racism in Canada, even  stupid little comments thrown in whenever people  insult you. They always seem to make it about my race,  no matter what.  It happens to my brother too. My brother was  trying to break up a fight between a guy and some kid  on the bus, and the guy says, "Shut up, you stupid little  nigger." My brother started fighting him and ended up  getting community service for that, yet absolutely  nothing happened to the white guy.  Titi: Even though I was born in Vancouver, I have  to deal with the fact that there's not enough Black  people here. School is hard because I don't know how  people will take it when I say, "Can we do Black history  month?" They think it's only for Black people and that  I'm being racist against them. I have to keep forcing  myself to speak up because if I don't tell them about it,  who will? I'm the only Black person in the class where  I brought up the idea this year of doing a report on  Black history month.  Toni: Why is Black history month important to you?  Jillian: In Nova Scotia, it meant a lot of things  happening, at the libraries for example. Black history  month means a big celebration just for being a Black  person—more than during the rest of the year. The  culture is so specific and special and the people are  great. But it doesn't seem to mean a whole lot in  Vancouver. In the future, I'm going to try and make it  mean something to other people.  Tovah: Black history month is important because  my mother taught me about Black history all my life.  It's just as much a part of me as anything else on my  body. I also think it's important because Black people  have endured so much and have achieved greater  things than any white man, because they had to rise  above people putting them down.  I want to teach people my history. I want to say,  "Yeah, Black people created what you're wearing. A  Black person created that." If I said a Black person, or  a person of colour built the CN Tower, you'd question  it and say, "How do you know? Are you sure?" If  someone said a white man built that tower, you'd just  go, "Yeah." White people totally want to deny the fact  that maybe a Black man could do so-and-so.  Black history month is also important because it's  when we can set things straight, like doing this story  right now for Kinesis. And so when my little brother  grows up, he won't have to feel uncomfortable in class  about raising his hand up. Even I feel weird about  raising my hand and telling the teacher it was a Black  "When I say to the teacher I want to  learn Black history, I don't want to hear  that we were slaves: I know that. I want  to know about our achievements..."  man, not a white man, who did that. It's not my job to  correct the teacher but if I don't, nobody in the school  will.  Marie: I feel we should all know about Black history. We don't learn it in school and nobody cares  about it. But I care so I want to know. Black history  month itself is kind of meaningless because nobody  pays any regard to it. I learn as much as I can because  my mom teaches me and I read books. I want to know  about my ancestors and I want to know everything  we've lived through. I want to know about who I am,  what I've been and what I'll be.  Titi: Black history is important for all the things  we've achieved. There's so many things I don't know  about my history and so much I need to know about  our struggles. I was reading about Rosa Parks and the  fact that she had to go to jail because she said, "No, I  won't move to the back of the bus." [referring to segregation laws in the US requiring Blackpeople to sit at the back  of the bus.] People don't seem to understand that Black  history month isn't just for Black people. It's a way for  us all to come together despite the history of slavery,  and because going through slavery has traumatized  the race.  If there was no such thing as Black history month,  I probably wouldn't be able to talk about Martin Luther  King and Rosa Parks and all those people, and I  probably wouldn't have any self-respect for myself, or  know I can achieve so-and-so too. Because those people had the courage to say, "I'm a human being too. I  have a heart and a mind like anyone else," that gives me  courage, too.  I learned the other day that a Black man was the  first world explorer to get to the Antarctic. A white  man got the credit for it and the Black guy became a  clerk or something. The books he wrote were largely  unsold. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm doing a report  this year on Black history month, I probably wouldn't  have heard of him.  Tovah: I want to add that whi le it's hard to be Black,  it's hell to be a Black woman. You get double the  pressure. If we do get to learn Black history, we're  probably going to learn about the men first. I want it to  come close to home, to learn about Black women's  history. I can relate better to a Black woman because  my mom is one.  It's important to me, as a young person, to see how  my mother made it—she had a child at 15 and then kept  having children. Now I'm 15 and go to school; I've got  a home. If she can make it, I should make it even better.  It's like living my mom's dream—not that I have to live  up to her standards, but she made me set goals and  showed me she could do it, that I am her daughter and  am strong just like her.  Titi: The fact that schools don't teach anything  about Black people pisses me off. I know more about  white history which has little to do with me. I don't give  a damn about Christopher Columbus because he did  not discover this country—it belonged to the First  Nations people. I don't think we should be taught  about Columbus in school.  They have this stereotype about us, especially in  the media, about how Black people are criminals, they  have babies at a young age, they don't know how to  take care of them.... If teachers talk about Black people,  it's in one sentence: "They were slaves." They don't  mention the struggles and pain they had to go through,  or tell the real story of what happened, how they  crowded people together in the ships as if  they were animals.  I'm not saying we should only have Black  history, but the history is not complete. They  talk about the colonists, about how Aboriginal peoples were slaves first, then Black people [were]. But then they beat about the bush  and don't get specific. If you want to talk  about history, bring up everything. If they  don't teach Black and Native history in school, I'm not  being fully educated.  Jillian: I quit school twoyearsagobecausel couldn't  deal with the pressure, I didn't like the teachers and the  way they treated me. This was in Halifax. There were  Black people at school, but the teachers were white.  About 90 percent of the students didn't finish the  year. I was in high school for two years in Halifax and  met maybe two Black kids who had graduated. Everyone just wants to hang out in the cafeteria and party,  and the principal doesn't stop you and say, "Go to  class." He doesn't care if you graduate. It's got nothing  to do with his pay cheque.  We fought for a year to get a Black history course  put into the curriculum. When we finally got it, we  were so happy, everyone signed up for it—but you  needed a grade 12 English credit to get in. Then we  found out it wasn't a Black history course but a regular  English course that would sometimes use books by  Black authors. In early January, I asked friends in  Halifax how the class was going, and they hadn't read  anything by a Black author yet.  Now they have a Black guidance counsellor at each  of the high schools who's supposed to be from the  'hood and be able to control his own people. He's only  there to keep us down—there are a lot of riots and stuff  like that, and kids will skip off school to go to other  schools and cause trouble. Sure it's stereotypical stuff,  but they don't teach you anything and until they do, I  ain't going back.  Tovah: I don't feel like I'm learning what I want to  be taught and I feel I have the right to be taught. I know  I need the basics but I also need to feel I can go further.  A lot of white girls and boys graduate—they know  their history. They can say, "Mom, I learned about so-  and-so today, he's our cousin or whatever way back."  I don't want to learn about that anymore. I know  they're the ones who colonized. Okay, I get it! They try  to convince me that white people are number one. I'm  not convinced.  I want to learn something about me now, or about  that girl across the room who's not Black nor white. I  want to learn how they cook food, how they lived way back in pre-historic times, what they did. That's history. That's what's going to make me be fascinated by  this course, what intrigues me to want to know more.  Learning about Hudson Bay just kills it for me.  Today when they talk about Nova Scotia in the  school system, it's about fishing, about Peggy's Cove—  they make it seem like everybody in Halifax goes to the  harbour every Sunday to fish. It's not like that. They  don't talk about the race riots or that Halifax was the  first place that Black people ever settled. When I say to  the teacher I want to learn Black history, I don't want  to hear that we were slaves: I know that. I want to know  about our achievements, what goals to set.  Half the school is made up of different cultures. It  might spark something in us if we learned about  different cultures. Maybe then we'd get more Native  kids and kids of colour graduating instead of just white  kids.  Today a friend and I went to the teacher and said,  "We want a petition asking for Black studies and  multicultural studies. Will you help us?" The teacher  said yes. I looked at him and thought, "Oh my god, that  was easy." But I know it was luck. I know the next step  is going to be even harder just by the way he said yes.  We feel we're the only ones who want things to  change but it's not true. When I went to school, my  friend Leah said, "I want a petition. I don't feel that I'm  learning enough." Then I go home and my brother  doesn't know I'm listening to him and my mother talk,  and he says, "Mom, I want to learn  some Black history. I want to start a  petition." It's in us all, but we never talk  about it because we're never asked.  I think our parents have really  strong kids because we're not leaving it  up to other people and we're not saying, "When we're 20, we'll try to do  something for Black history month."  We're all teenagers here in this room.  At first, I thought this project was about  doing this for Kinesis, but when I go  back to school, I notice people really if  want action. My friends want to learn  about this stuff. That makes me say,  "Tovah, you gotta go girl, you gotta do  it!"  Marie: There are no Black teachers  at my school, no one I can relate to  because everybody at my school is white.  I'm getting an education, but not one I  want. I want to know who did this, who  did that, where, when, but all I learn, in  socials for example, is about European  explorers.  Titi: I am studying about explorers,  too, right now. The thing that's weird is  as they get further from being "pure"  white, there's less information. The  teachers say education is going to get more complicated [if we change things]. In other words, we're  going to be learning more new things. Look how long  Black history has been around—since the beginning of  time. But I only started learning about it two years ago.  Jillian: A Black man came to our school one time  and he told us a bunch of things and brought up a good  point. They teach you about the evolution theory, and  the scientific theory where something exploded somewhere, but they don't teach you about the Black woman  theory—that everyone evolved from one Black woman  in Africa, and as you moved further north and south  and east and west, you lost pigment in your skin due  to the climate and environment. That sounds far more  realistic than evolution or something blowing up in  space or Adam and Eve. It's closer to home for me. But  they don't talk about it, not even in religious studies.  Titi: It's like that with anything to do with places  that are considered "third world countries." These are  basically places that were either stolen from or invaded. People say, "Oh, they're all poor," et cetera. It's  a put down. I feel if I went to a third world country, I'd  probably learn about so many backgrounds and histories and the amazing achievements you'd never learn  here.  People also say Canada's a free place where you  can have respect and can speak your mind. If you can  speak your mind, why isn't Black history being taught?  Why can't we learn these things about ourselves?  Marie: I used to live in Ethiopia and they consider  that a third world country. Whenever I speak to people  about Ethiopia, they ask me questions like, "Were you  starving there?" I wasn't starving! I lived. People ask  me what kind of a house 1 lived in: "Was it a dirty  shack?"  They have this idea of what each place in the world  is like and think that's how it is. They don't really know.  Even if it was like that, they wouldn't know that it's  because white people came, colonized it, kept things  for themselves and then left everything in a big mess.  People think we did that, probably because we're lazy  or we never work. It's absolutely not true.  Tovah: It goes back to white people teaching the  history. That's why nobody knowsanything about any  other culture. Let's teach our own history and then it'll  get taught right. I always question my social studies  book because I know white men wrote all the textbooks. Nowadays, it's getting a little better, people of  colour are writing the occasional book.  My mother told me the other day that Beethoven  was Black, he ain't white. So in class I say, "He's white  in this picture, biit he ain't white in the picture I saw  yesterday." They say, "Well, I didn't know that. We'll  talk about it later after class." I want to say, "No, we  won't!" You try to scare the teachers and they get  scared because they don't know what you knoio.  Titi: A lot of people get really nervous around  Black people. We had a substitute teacher this month  and she was talking about Black people and Africa.  Then she noticed I was in the class. She started stuttering as if she had forgotten her language: "Urn, okay,  Back left-to-right: Jillian, Titi and Tovah. Front: Marie  well, Black people in um Africa..." and I'm thinking,  "What is she um talking ah. .about?"  If I have a question, they act like I'm trying to put  them down, that maybe they don't know better, that  they shouldn't be a teacher. But that's their problem. I  think my question deserves to be answered. I want to  know if they feel it was a white person who did so-and-  so, and I want to know what their source for that is.  I have to talk about the media again. They always  name three or four countries in Africa where people are  all starving. A country, never mind a continent, is a big  place. They never tell you anything else about that  country. Starvation is going on here in Canada too, but  it doesn't mean it's happening for everyone.  People here think one little fact about a certain  people and that's the way it is for everybody. Maybe a  few Black people may have an attitude problem and  they'll say all Black people have attitudes. When people meet me, they say, "I used to think you were like all  those Black girls that have major attitude." And what  if I do have "attitude?" If I get mad, I might start doing  the hand thing but that's just a way of expressing  yourself, like slang or a figure of speech.  Tovah: People always make fun of me in class,  especially when I talk about Black history month because I get really mad. So when I have a question to  ask.. .like when I asked the teacher today, "Can we have  a petition?" I mumbled it and couldn't talk any louder.  N( v I think I have a nice, big, strong voice so I felt like  I was looking up to my teacher and it made me mad. He  wrote it out on the board and said, "You can either do  this or this."  I got tears in my eyes, I was so angry. They expect  us to throw things around, but when they don't teach  Black history, when they say something wrong or  disregard what I say, it makes me want to get up and  headbutt him or something. Instead, I turn red and  start shaking. The most I can do is stare down the  teacher and try to mess him up when he's talking.  Toni: As young Black women, how do you feel about  your opportunities and future?  Titi: I feel if I want to get opportunities, actually be  accepted in this world and achieve things, I have to do  it for myself. You have to say, "Okay, I'll do my math  homework." You can't say, "I'll do it tomorrow." Your  future becomes what you make of the present.  As a young Black woman, I feel I have to work  harder than someone who isn't Black. I get good grades  in school but if I did one thing wrong, it would seem  like all that reputation I built up since I was a kid would  be gone. They'd say, "Oh, she's just one of those Black  people that are on the streets and doing all those  crimes." Yet there are so many people committing  crimes who aren't Black; most of them are white. They  know that but they have that [idea] that all white  people are smart and created all that stuff and did all  those things.  I'll have to work hard to make a future for myself  because it's hard right now and I don't know how it's  going to be in a couple of years. Black people are getting  used to the fact we need to know about ourselves and,  once you've realized that, you can go further. We've  come such a long way but we have to keep on going.  Marie: Being a young Black woman is the  toughest thing to be because we have to put  up with men and with people that are racist  toward us. It's a man's world and a white  person's world too. When you're a Black  person and a woman, people are always  looking for some reason not to include you  in something. You've always got to do your  best to be on top. If a white person and I  were going for the same job, I know they'd  look for a reason to hire the white person  because that happens to my mother. The  people who have all the power up there are  white men.  But I'm going to do whatever I want to.  I feel being a young Black woman makes  me want to work all the harder. I want to  get somewhere and I want every other  o> Black woman to rise above everything.  i 3   People put hurdles for us to go over, and  g   I'm going to go over them.  J' Tovah: I feel I have a long road ahead of  j? me, just like any other woman of colour  ■f   has. It's not all about white people; there's  I °- Black against Black, white against Hispanic  against Black. There is a lot of racism. And  we may be Black women but we are women  first.  I know I have a future, that there's  something out there waiting for me because I can tell—  everyday I go to school or when I look in the mirror, I  look at myself and say, "You're going to go somewhere, you're going to be somebody, don't worry." As  long as I've got my family behind me and my mother  ahead to guide me, I don't feel I have anything to worry  about.  I think the worst part is already over—being young  and having to go through some of the stuff I've been  through. I'm a strong person and I'll make a future for  myself. I'm going to try to do it all. I don't get the best  gradesand I'm not the best person, but I'mhuman just  like anybody else. I can overcome great obstacles just  like anybody else. I think my future's pretty bright.  Jillian: There's not a lot of opportunities for me as  a youth. No one takes you seriously. Being a young  Black woman, I've fallen into all the stereotypes I could  have: I dropped out of school; I've fooled around; I  only got a grade 10 education; I've gotten pregnant;  I've gotten on welfare; I moved out when I was 16. All  these things are due to not getting enough support at  school, at home—though my mom tried so hard, I  couldn't listen to what she had to say; I had to learn for  myself.  I'm going to be 19 soon and right now, the future  doesn't look so bright because I feel I have to step back  a couple of steps. But I've got high hopes. I've got a job  for the first time and have been there five months. I've  got clothes. I'm enrolled in school. I'm overcoming a lot  of hurdles I fell off before.

Commentary  A feminist debate:  Naming murdered women  by Helen Story  and Shelagh Plunkett  A funny thing happened on the  way to the December 6th vigil this year  in Victoria. Feminists here decided it  was time to move beyond an exclusive  focus on the Montreal Massacre by naming local victims of femicide.  A few weeks before the event, this  idea stirred up intense controversy  within the feminist community. According to some feminists in Victoria, we  should not publicly identify murdered  women and children without the permission of their families. Could feminists really be suggesting that we silence  ourselves in the name of "privacy" and  protecting "family"?  Wedecided toshareourexperience  wi th other communities which may face  similar conflicts on this issue.  It started when the Victoria Status  of Women Action Group's (SWAG's)  December 6th Committee uncovered in  its research the name of a murder victim related to a member of the SWAG  CoordinatingCollective. She demanded  her relative's name not be read and that  the Committee cancel their plans to  read any other names of murdered  women and children unless they had  "full family permission."  The Collective member solicited  support letters from well-known local  feminists, including a transition house  counsellors feminist journalist, a sexual  assault worker and a women's studies  lecturer. The December 6th Committee  was accused of "thoughtless cruelty"  and"sacrificing one woman for another," despite the Committee's decision to compromise by omitting the  name which had sparked the controversy. The SWAG CoordinatingCollective could not reach consensus on sponsoring (or condemning) a naming vigil  and most of the December 6th Committee resigned from SWAG, in order to go  ahead with the plans.  This group of women held a particularly moving vigil for women and  children only, without the sponsorship  of any organization. Costs were covered by donations from individual  women in the community. Posters for  the event and a speech before the vigil  made it clear that names would be read,  to give notice to those who wanted the  option of not staying. All the names that  were read were already on public record.  The feminists who were against  naming victims provided a range of  arguments. Many suggested that the  Committee was uncompassionate and  operating only from their heads.  After attending a meeting of the  Committee, one woman wrote a letter:  "The [Committee's] arguments were  analytically sound, intellectually flawless, articulate and politically justified.  I couldn't challenge those arguments  then and I won't try now because the  essence of this issue fundamentally defies the rigours of political debate. It  transcends neat, rational, precise  boundaries... [Not naming] is the right  thing to do—and I don't really even  know why—because I feel it is right,  because the alternative hurts people."  We began to feel feminist analysis  wasnolongerpartofthedebate.Wealso  felt that the personal experiences on  which we based our position were ignored.  Other feministsquestioned whether  the December 6th Committee had the  right to say what "counts" as violence  against women. To quote from another  letter:  "...cases where the killer has been  tried and convicted...[are] a safe and  respectful starting place when compiling a list of names to read aloud at a  public vigil. We all know that women  are murdered by men who have abused  and threatened, sometimes stalked them,  and who then kill themselves. Media  reports that confirm unequivocally women's histories of abuse are a reasonable  source of names for the list proposed by  the December 6th committee, though I  would urge caution to be sure that unfair judgements [of the alleged murderers] aren't made to break the silence."  According to this logic, we gather  that murder/suicidesshouldn't be mentioned on December 6th (because the  perpetrator has not been convicted),  unless we can prove the murderer had a  history of abusing his victim. Isn't murdering one woman enough to qualify a  man as an abuser? We also heard the  argument that a murder committed by a  man with a history of depression doesn't  count either—which seems to stretch  the insanity defense to new levels of  absurdity.  This issue came up at the same time  as the national debate about Tracy  Latimer's murder. [Tracy, a disabled  girl, was murdered by her father because he allegedly couldn't bear her suffering.] We saw a clear parallel with the  way in which her murder was being  redefined as "love."  Perhaps the most often repeated  argument was framed in "therapese," or  therapy speak. It involved an assumption that women would be traumatized  rather than empowered by hearing a  loved one's name. Another critic wrote:  February 17-18, 1995  Social Policy Conference  Organizing to Win  Open Meetino, Friday 7 PM  Murray Dobbin speaking on "  Zealand Revolution: Miracle  Nightmare"; Jackie Larkin,  Action Committee on the Sta  Women; Don Holder, national  president of the Communicat  Energy and Paperworkers Uni  Displays, cash bar, childca  Registered Forum, ALL-DAT SATURDAY  Panels on International Social  Policy and Feminism and Social  To Register or for further  information call Trade Union  Research Bureau - 255-7346.  Sponsored by Vancouver and Disl  Labour Council with financial  support of the C.L.C. and  Communications, Energy and  Paperworkers Union.  "Triggers to past trauma exist all  around us. For survivors, we use the  best coping mechanisms we have. If we  know that the name of someone close  will be said, we can put on our best  armour or simply stay away. I have to  question the ethics of SWAG considering knowingly setting up a trigger that  could possibly retraumatize women at  the vigil and dismissing our responsibility to those women by saying 'we have  two or three counsellors present'.  How have we come to a place where  grief is something feminists try to protect each other from or relegate to the  therapy office? This line of thinking was  particularly offensive to those who  agreed with naming and who have been  close to murdered girls and women.  Some women suggested there might  be other equally powerful ways to break  the silence about local women and children's murder—like describing the victims, but giving no names. In our opinion, this omission would largely serve  the interests of the murderers and those  loyal to them.  We were accused by feminists of using murdered women for "political gain"  in a way that paralleled men's attack on  feminists after the Montreal Massacre.  From another prominent local feminist: "...even to consider the possibility  of reading out names of local murdered  women seems to be a crass privileging of  political gestures over individual women's extreme pain...It just feels chilling,  and eerily reminiscent of the old male  Left..."  For us, this controversy raised a lot  of questions. How are we defining family and how do we get their permission?  Isn't it invasion of privacy to track them  down? What happens when the families  are divided? Or when some members  are also related to the murderer and are  trying to protect his reputation? Have  we ever asked the families of the Montreal Massacre victims for their permission to use the victims' names? Would  we stop naming those women if permission was denied? If we were killed,  would we want feminists to give in to  family pressure to not name us?  The fuzzy thinking on this issue  seems to be spreading beyond Victoria.  Inspired by a recent issue of Ms Magazine, which listed murdered women on  its covers (without seeking family permission), the BC & Yukon Association of  Transition Houses (BCYATH) came up  with the idea of putting out a poster of  the names of BC women killed by their  intimate partners. They decided they  would require the permission of at least  one family member. However, as of January 4th, they were considering scrapping the whole idea because of objections from some member groups. Most  of the objections were similar to those  we've already described. On the other  hand, Vancouver's Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW) read  the names of murdered women at their  December 6th vigil, without creating  any stir.  Why all the fuss now? We speculate  it's because the level of activism within  women's groups is on the decline, accompanied by the rise of psychobabble.  This is known in some circles as the  "professionalization" of the women's  movement. We also wonder whether  feminists are reading anything other than  self-help books anymore. We suggest  that women who want to learn more  about femicide read The Lust to Kill by  Deborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer,  Femicide edited by Jill Radford and Diana  Russel, and Next Time, She'll Be Dead by  Ann Jones.  When violence hits close to home,  it's easy for feminists to get thrown off  track unless we work towards building  a solid experience-based analysis. We  hope women in other communities will  take a clear stand, long before next year's  December 6th preparations. We must  continue to take the war against girls  and women seriously by naming our  dead.  Shelagh Plunkett is a writer and editor.

It was a busy week, with more than 75  events in six Vancouver venues.  1995 marks the seventh year of  Women in View. The festival was founded  in 1989 by a group of professional artists, who recognized the array of outstanding work by women artists and the  corresponding lack of opportunities to  view their work. They set out to provide  opportunity, visibility, education, employment and support for women in the  performing arts, while educating the  public about women's roles and issues.  The festival strives to further working  relationships between women of different social, cultural, and economic experiences through a variety of art forms.  1995 also marks the first time a similar festival takes place in Victoria. Called  Focus on Women Arts Festival February 2  to 5.  Below is a look at Margaret Dragu's  My Secret Kitchen."  MY SECRET KITCHEN  By Margaret Dragu  Women in View  Vancouver, January 26,28,29  Audiences across the country have  heralded this multidisciplinary performance piece. In January, Vancouver  women finally had the chance in January to peer into the "secret kitchen" of  local performance artist, writer and video  artist Margaret Dragu.  My Secret Kitchen employs text,  dance, music, xeroxes, found objects,  borrowed objects, newspaper articles  and clotheslines in a performance of  mothers, stories and art.  In a new phase of her ongoing artistic life, marked by the birth of her young  daughter a number of years ago, Dragu  found herself spending much of her  time alone in her kitchen, cut off from  the outside world with the exception of  her portable radio. She developed a  strong sense of herself as an isolated  caregiver, and asa woman—asa mother.  She felt a contrast between her inner  world and the'Tar outside world" of the  women and families, framed by media  and filtered into her life through her  portable radio. Sheheard stories of stress  and violence, of women and children  forced from their homes, killed in wars,  faraway yet somehow connected.... Both  worlds seemed secret—hers because of a  culture that does not recognize the reality of the lives and needs of caregivers,  and theirs because she sensed that the  reports were not the truth, that the real  experiences of these women and their  children were lost in the stories created  for news.  Dragu describes her kitchen as "secret" because "full-time caregivers of  young children are often stuck in the  kitchen and their work is invisible or  'secret'." Her work aims to "bring these  'secret kitchens' (and the people in them)  out into the open," to show that they are  jagged and intense, not the "pastel-  lambykins-bunny-baby-booboo images  offered by television, magazines, billboards and the baby product industry."  The "voices" in My Secret Kitchen,  come from this experience of isolation,  from her sense of the sound and stories  that surrounded her as she worked to  raise her child. Many of these stories  first appeared in Dragu's radio series  Mumz Radio—a collection of interviews,  poems and music by women in the secret world of motherhood—and later in  the book Mothers Talk Back, a collection  of writings edited by Margaret Dragu,  Sarah Sheard and Susan Swan. The stories, both painful and comic, come to life  in this performance in many forms  amongst the confines of a surreal  kitchen—a radio, an oven and a clothesline displaying newspaper stories of parents and children representing the outside world.  My Secret Kitchen is a spontaneous  and ever-changing performance that has  been performed in a range of settings  across the country, from Peterborough,  Ontario, where Dragu created a huge  installation kitchen completely covered  in papier mache, to Hornby Island, with  Won't miss It this time!  tuesday feb.7th thru  Saturday feb. 18th-8:30pm  Sunday feb.12th matinee-4pm  presentation  986-1351 for tickets  Margaret Dragu performing Secret Kitchen  no props at all, only a jazz band dressed  in red aprons. The performance for  Women in View was to be a lively "festival suitcase version" with some new  twists.  Margaret Dragu is excited by the  chance to perform the show in her own  city, and the opportunity to take part in  Women in View. She enthusiastically  describes the great "excitement and energy generated by festivals...the talent  and activity" and sees it as an excellent  opportunity to showcase the work of  women in the performing arts. She is  also excited by the number of performances focussing on motherhood. "Five  years ago you would not have seen this  much stuff on moms and on caregiving  ...itshowsarealchangeintheartworld."  Dragu feels strongly that it is important we speak out on issues of caregiving,  family, and motherhood. As a feminist,  she strongly supports choice. "It is very  dangerous to allow the extreme right  wing to be the loudest or the only voice  of family. It is important that we have a  lot of choice about what a family can  mean, about caregiving options and  options for partnerships in caregiving.  We have to explore the options and  stand up for this."  Some highlights of other performances  at the festival that dealt zvith motherhood  include:  Mom's the Word—Six moms explore  motherhood in a "kitchen table" cabaret. The  play can be seen at the Firehall Theatre this  month, [see ad, page 18 for details.]  Mother of Pearl—Stiletto Company  presents a tart clozvn comedy described as "a  recipe formothers and daughters you'll never  find in The Joy of Cooking."

The palette is  the rich mosaic of our experiences.  The Very Ins ide: An An thology of Writing by Asian and Pacific Islander Lesbians  and Bisexual Women adds to the growing  literature by lesbians of colour available  and to the clarity of our lives. In the  tradition of publications like Piece of My  Heart: A Lesbian of Colour Anthology and  Between the Lines: An Anthology of Pacific/  Asian Lesbians of Santa Cruz, this anthology not only documents our existence,  but reaches out to isolated women everywhere and asserts our presence and  our history in a hostile world which has  long rendered us invisible.  The Very Inside documents and promotes both the process of growth and  the coming into our power for the readers and the writers alike. Issues of identity are challenged and promoted by  books like this.  Sharon Lim-Hing edited thismonu-  mental work over four long years of  extended deadlines and calls for submissions throughout Canada and the  United States. Included are short stories, essays, interviews, poetry, visual  art, conversations, letters and prose.  There is writing by women who call  themselves dykes, lesbians, lovers, warriors and feminists, women who are  political and sensual. It is a book of  women's voices, lesbian and bisexual,  whose heritages are from Asia—Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia—and  the Pacific Islands—indigenous Samo-  ans, Fijians, Hawaiians, Guamanians,  Polynesians. Also included are writers  of mixed races. That they now live in  North America adds to their complex  heritages.  Because of the sheer volume and  variety of the works in them anthologies  can be problematic. The five sections in  The Very Inside—"Origins and Departures," "Finding/Founding Community," "Waking from a Dream of Love,"  "Life Struggle," and "Out of Fire,  Grace"—function in theory but, because  the writings contain such overlapping  issues, the works are not so easily categorized. For example, politics and  search for community exist across the  divisions, and are not limited to "Out of  Fire, Grace." Vanessa Marzan Deza's  very beautiful and sexy piece "Distractions," for example, might have been  included in "Waking from a Dream of  Love" rather than "Finding/Founding  Community." Moreover, one almost  needs a map to chart one's way through  the complex heritages and experiences.  Yet despite the limits of organization, editor Lim-Hing faces the challenge of grouping so many divergent  groups in one book successfully. And  while each writer's experiences are  shaped differently—by heritage, racism,  homophobia, family origins and westernization—there is much that draws  their works together. Common threads  of emotions—pain, anger, joy, and sorrow—are shared. I related too well to  Juliana Pegues and Pei Lu Fung who,  "after years of living in the States, is still  called a foreigner." Many of us have  experienced the loss of family members,  the pain of rejection by our cultural sisters, or the ecstasy of connecting with  others "like us."  I have always thrilled to find in  books something of me, of my experience. This search for community is part  of my eternal search for myself. This  book has the power to forge connections  to a greater community for its readers,  isolated by geography and mainstream  society itsel f. For the writers, it offers the  opportunity to reach out, to speak of  their lives. In Ami R. Mattison's words  as a Pacific Islander, it confronts the  "privilege and power of a culturally  specific and singular racial identity."  In grouping Asians and Pacific Islanders in one book, a tentative alliance  results from the prevailing issues of exclusion and conflictingstruggles for identity. However, the benefits from opening up this discussion are overwhelming: by including works by Pacific Islanders, the book challenges us to examine the exclusions and stereotypes that  exist not only in the mainstream reality,  but within our specific marginalised  communities.  In presenting these voices together,  we can also see the differences between  the groups. J. Kehaulani Kauanui and Ju  Hui "Judy" Han note that the danger of  inclusion tendstoengulfthemand make  them further invisible. They note the fact  that experiences and stereotypes between Pacific Islander women and  Asiansdiffer: "stereotypical passivity of  Native Hawaiians is more linked to supposed laziness and stupidity than sub-  missiveness," and Pacific Islanders are  not viewed as "geishas" with "perceived  coyness," butareimagined simpler, with  "exotic beauty closer to stereotyes of  African- American women than Asians."  Trinity. Ordona and Ann Yuri Uyeda  provide both sides of the debate of a  conversation that opened the 1989 APL  retreat.  The Very Inside steps beyond limits  of a truncated version of Asians. It  presentsanimportantdialogue between  the writers, and with the readers. And  between the covers of this book lie some  excellent writings by both new and more  Issues of  identity  are challenged  by books  like this  established writers in our communities.  Linda Fong, C. Allyson Lee, Amy A.  Zukeran and Teresa Tan honour their  grandmothers for their strengths and  struggles. I smiled to read C. Allyson  Lee's "2632 Then and Now," about her  memories of her grandmother's house. I  could almost see and smell the rooms  described.  Alice Y. Horn's sexy and whimsical,  "APL's [Asian Pacific Lesbian] Alphabet" brought a smile to my face. V.K.  Aruna's piece "AT&A" and Tomiye  IshidaVAkairo" added pleasurableand  sensual spice to the rhythms of the book.  The Very Inside is entertaining in the  sheer variety of styles, and subjects. It  both entertains and challenges. And in  its emotional power, draws readers in to  participate in a painting of great beauty  and power.  I too relate to Svati Shah's pain when  she says, "I am from bookstores and  bookshelves which have seen my disappointed back when I realized that volumes of childhood friends had never  known an Indian heart."  As if in response, The Very Inside  permits us to define our own diverse  identities, and our lives.  Francis Michiko Mochizuki is a Japanese  Canadian Sansei lesbian living in Vancouver, who works in an office to pay her  bills but finds her pleasure in reading  books.  16  FEBRUARY 1995 Arts  Review: SKY Lee's Bellydancer;  Your own  erotic  by Rita Wong  BELLYDANCER  By SKY Lee  Press Gang Publishers, Vancouver 1994  At the Vancouver launch of the book  Bellydancer, Vancouver writer SKY Lee  challenged the audience to ask themselves who they dance naked for or, as I  interpreted it at the time, how they define  what is erotic for themselves.  But while one of the main threads  running through the book is the idea of  women reclaiming what is erotic for ourselves, the erotic is only one component  of something larger, as the dance of life  and spirit clearly propel many of the  characters. The short stories in Bellydancer  are filled with women who choose to  define themselves, who dance life on  " their own terms.  The back cover of the book reminds  us that "bellydancing was originally performed at the bedside of women in labour, as an erotic dance of creation."  Using this as a jumping point, Lee challenges the reader to see bellydancing  through women's own eyes, rather than  through the established and somewhat  sordid ways we have learned.  The trilogy of Bellydancer stories  presents us with tough-talking, gritty  women and men who know poverty,  tragedy and survival firsthand, and  who, as one character states, "are not  supposed to live long enough to tell our  stories."  The trilogy converges around the  mesmerizing figure of Seni, and leads  us to revisit "Pompeii," a story told by  a woman named Dance of the Eternal  Spirit. She states, "I alone, it seems,  for romance—beginning with oneself.  In this story, the protagonist's approach  to love acknowledges the power and  attraction of illusion but at the same time  strives for honesty. Storiessuchas"Dyke  Dollars," "WinterTanToo,"and "Lesbi-  ansandtheirSubversives," view lesbian  characters from many different angles,  both critical and supportive. "Winter  Tan Too" manages to include an interracial relationship, escapist vacations and  a strip club. Sexual politics withhumour  and flair! As Lee points out, "not everybody can vacation with her ex-lover and  her new lover at the same time."  Always hungry for stories about activists, I was particularly drawn to the  strength and intelligence of Naomi in  "Lesbians and other Subversives," as  she calmly and persistently lives her  own life. "Nancy Drew Mysteries" takes  a stab at the interchange between the  erotic and the pornographic, not an easy  thing to do. The whimsical and touching  "Crosswalk Man" makes me see the  pedestrian with new eyes. I often think  of this story as I walk down the street.  As Lee points out, "Not everybody can  vacation with her ex-lover and her new lover  at the same time."  have chosen not to live in the atrium of  my master's house. I don't know if this  makes them afraid for me, or afraid of  me." Read together, the bellydancing  stories call forth the imperative of our <  legendary foremothers.  This book is more than an exuberant romp, for Lee makes the reader  work hard, even as she experiments  with popular modes such as historical  fiction, romance, and crime fiction. "Safe  Sex" deals with creating a healthy basis  "Broken Teeth," an earlier work exploring a mother/daughter relationship, is a  strong piece in and of itself, but it also  serves asa contrast between Lee's previous writing and her current work. Her  writing has developed in many directions since "Broken Teeth" even as she  continues to investigate characters in  their many complexities—sexual orientation, race, class and gender—often  playfully, sometimes all too painfully  real. Shechallengesconventionand com  fort, shaking up pat notions of humanity  and community so as to reinvigorate  them.  As Seni points out in "Bellydancer:  Level One," people often fall into vanity  or void. Many of Lee's stories remind us  of our own vanities while celebrating  our efforts to grow.  "Daisy the Sojourner" critically and  humourously interrogates both the feminist community and the Chinese community with an honesty much more  valuable than unquestioning acceptance,  and deeper than seeing the communities as someone's "flavour of the month."  "The Soong Sisters" tells the tale of  the rather unpredictable way in which a  sister saves "the home of 16 old ladies  who kind of like living with each other,  three cranky old men who kind of don't,  33 pigeons, five cats, three budgies, two  canaries, one very old dog, one cockatiel,  ten caged rats and mice and who knows  how many loose ones—all in one go!"  While the sisters' methods of avoiding  eviction and holding on to low-income  housing may not be repeatable by others, they do open a window into creativity and tenacity.  Those who have read Lee's book  Disappearing Moon Cafe will recognize  Lee's full-blown, tongue-in-cheek and  sometimes overpowering style as melo-  dramaticandlush.Abundantwordplay  sticks its head in the reader's face. The  description and narration resist falling  into cold efficiency and throw us into  the realm of emotion and struggle.  Bellydancer is not always an easy  read, but definitely one worth much  time and attention. The nuggets of humour and insight scattered throughout  kept this reader going late into the night.

Review: Dirty Weekend;  A bloody lovely book  by Emma Kivisild  DIRTY WEEKEND  by Helen Zahavi  Harper Collins, London, England,  1991  What a bad bad book this is. And  how I love it. It's bloody, it's rude, it  makes you squirm and wince and turn  away from the page, and then it makes  you read frantically, whispering to yourself, "Come on, come on, kill him, kill  him."  Don't get me wrong. I'm a feminist,  and a non-violent one at that. Strengthening gun control is the only thing the  Liberal government has done that I can  stand. I am opposed to the death penalty, a prison abolitionist. I lead a woman-  centred life, which involves helpingraise  a teenage boy. If you told me I'd like a  book about a woman exacting gory revenge on a series of men, I'd think you  didn't know me.  But I like it. Dirty Weekend is gory,  true. But it's not about gore. It's about  choosing not to be a victim, and what  that choice can mean.  Bella is a woman many of us know,  or are. She lives alone in the resort town  of Brighton, in England. She has no important friendships. She is stalked by a  voyeur. She has few dreams, beyond  sitting in the park absorbing sunlight.  "Does she matter, this Bella-person? This  nothing-person? She doesn't think so.  She doesn't think she matters. That's  what she thinks, at this moment, on the  bench in Brunswick Square."  But one day Bella has had enough.  And after a visit to a clairvoyant, she sees  her real aiminlife. "Sanitation," shecalls  it. She uses various weaponry to clear  the world of the abusive men that cross  her path in one dirty weekend.  Zahavi is a wonderful writer, which  helps the story enormously. I felt her  words, quick, sharp, and unrelenting.  The characters come to life instantly in  short sentences of bang-on description  and dialogue. And speaking of clairvoyant. The acid asides to the reader feel like  mind-reading. How did she know what  I was thinking?  Well, partly how she knows what  you are thinking is because this is profoundly a woman's book. Zahavi knows  what we all know—the fear, the constant  caution, the stifling rage. I don't think a  man could understand this book. I know,  I know, there are men who live in fear,  If you told me I'd  like a book about a  woman exacting  revenge on a series  of men...  too. But this is the universal terror of  women, writ exact. It hits home.  We have all been the woman, and  we all know the men. In Dirty Weekmd,  they come in varying degrees and forms  of creepiness. Like I say, sometimes it is  hard to keep reading. But none of this  loathesomeness is new. It's in the papers  every day, it's on TV and at the movies.  It's in our lives. It isreally just misogyny,  and Bella knows.  There is a character in Medieval  Jewish European history (or legend, call  it what you will) called the golem. A  golem is made of clay, in the form of a  huge human. It is usually depicted as  following the orders of a rabbi, and  takes revenge on anti-Semites. The Columbia Desk Encyclopedia says, "The  golem legends are often said to have  been a morale builder for oppressed  Jews in Medieval Europe." I have read  20th century Jewish writers who talk  about their bel iefs in golems, their elaborate golem revenge fantasies.  Bella is a golem, a golem for me, a  golem for women. I am paralyzed by  fear and sadness, overwhelmed by the  Montreal massacre, the battering statistics, the stalking, the incidence of rape.  But now I have Bella. And a bit of Bella  in me.  This last is the most important thing.  A book is intimate. A well-written book  is a lived experience. I have been Bella.  I have seen what a change in attitude—  from victim to avenger—can do to fear.  It wipes it out. How different to look  forward to a man's attempted assault,  knowing it is his last mistake. How  differentto be fearless. How wonderful.  Emma Kivisild is an artist and writer  living in Vancouver.

Love,  Kinesis  Radical Survivors  response to letters  Kinesis:  For those confused by recent letters  to Kinesis about the Dissociation, Mind  Control and Ritual Abuse Conference,  Making it Manageable, held in Vancouver  September 24 and 25, we'd like to state  a few facts.  We wrote the organizers of this conference August 8th and asked the following questions:  1. Were there any surviviors of ritualistic or group-related abuse involved  in the planning of this conference?  2. Are there any survivors facilitating workshops?  3. Why aren't survivors invited to  this conference?  4. Are there any women who define  themselves as feminists on the planning  committee? Are feminist organizations  involved?  5. Are there subsidies for survivors  who wish to attend who do not have  professional-level salaries?  6. Who are the funders and sponsors  for this conference?  7. What is the total budget for this  conference?  Four days before the conference, we  received a letter from conference co-  organizer Daniela Coates stating that it  would take a great deal of time to respond to our enquiries by correspondence. She asked us to phone her. We  faxed her a letter September 21st to say  that we'd rather have the answers in  writing. We repeated the questions in  fill-in-the-blank format. Wenever heard  from the conference organizers again.  It is for this reason that we chose to  address the issue in Kinesis. (However,  while we never received a copy of our  September 21st questionnaire back, we  have since heard that Kinesis was sent a  copy of it, filled in by the organizers.)  We have been faulted for not attending the conference. We find this ironic,  considering it was not financially accessible to us, we were not invited (not  being professional helpers) and we  weren't able to find out enough about  the conference to know whether it would  be of interest.  We're not sure why it is that survivors of ritual abuse to the east of the  Rockies seem to be able to get together,  when it's declared next to impossible  here. As we understand it, there have  been two conferences—by survivors, for  survivors—in Toronto in the past year.  We're not sure about the costs of the  first, but the second was free. Coates  was listed as a presenter at both conferences. Surely she could have used those  conferences as models for planning a  more empowering conference here. We  also find the assumption that we ourselves know little about safety concerns  extremely patronizing.  We are not the only feminists or  survivors tochallenge the role therapy is  playing in the feminist movement and in  the area of sexual/ritual abuse. We recommend that readers check out two  powerful new books: Changing Out-  Minds by Celia Kitzinger & Rachel  Perkins, and Rocking the Cradle of Sexual  Politics by Louise Armstrong.  It's all very well that the conference  organizers believe they have done many  years of good work in this field. Does  that make any conference they organize  above criticism? Does that mean they  don't have to answer questions posed  by survivors? We're still waiting.  Heather MacKenzie  Radical Survivors  Victoria, BC  Need dialogue  on ritual abuse  Kinesis:  It is a pleasure to receive your newspaper. I enjoy it very much.  Your coverage on the social policy  review and the fightback have been  empowering. I believe the lack of coverage in the mainstream media is a desire  toisoIateanddiscourageCanadiansfrom  fighting back. Your reporting of the issues and the fightback ends the isolation. Thank you.  I'm not familiar with the politics  around the Making It Manageable conference. But as a ritual abuse survivor and  a multiple who is proud of her  collectivity, I may have some comments  that will further this discussion.  As Connie Chapman says in her  letter [see Kinesis, Nov. 94], safety is an  issue. A reality I live with on a regular  basis is harassing phone calls, being followed on the streets, strangers at my  door in the middle of the night and  triggering materials left in my drive. I  have also had death threats as an adult.  I am choosing to use a pseudonym to  protect myself. The name also honours  my/our collectivity.  At the same time however, I have  had the kind of experience that Lys  Souvienne [see Kinesis, Nov. 94] refers  to. My dissociative skills have been used  as an excuse to dismiss me when my  sister feminists don't like my politics. I  got caught in a policy change at my  feminist sexual assault centre. When I  fought back because their new policy  rendered the service useless for me, the  staff started saying things like: "We can't  tru st you because you are multiple," and  "You are incapable of understanding  our policy because you dissociate."  I still have scars on my soul two  years later from this experience. You  would never have known by the way  that I was treated that I had trained them  on these issues of ritual abuse and dissociation. I no longer use the service as it is  not in my best interests.  Rosemary Doughty [see Kinesis, Dec/  Jan. 95] is right. We are hurting each  other in this movement. And we do need  to talk about this. I wonder if the first  step is learning to listen to each other  with respect. In my experience, this is  the problem. What do other readers  think?  Sincerely,  Carol Gentlepeople  Ontario  [Ed note: The city in Ontario was left  out to protect Carol's identity, at her request.]  FEBRUARY 1995 Letters  Beyond therapy:  ending ritual abuse  Kinesis:  I want to thank Lys Souvienne for her  comments and her courage. She has dared  to suggest that feminists take a political  look at the proliferation of therapy in  their community, and has called for a  political rather than therapeutic response  to violence against women.  While I was thinking about how to  respond to Lys' letter, and to the responses that attacked her, I heard Wendy  Kaminer talking on CBC about the difficulties she has encountered in her attempts to tender social or political criticism of the "recovery movement." Her  experience (and my own) is that any  criticism is met with the response "but it  saved my life," (or the life of someone I  know), without acknowledging any need  to critically examine, as feminists, the  political and social implications.  While it's true that therapy, especially feminist therapy, helps many  women (it helped save my life), it is not a  movement for social or political change.  Louise Armstrong, one of the pioneers of  breaking the silence about childhood  sexual assault, writes about how we had  hoped to "raise hell...and create a passion for change," but instead we "raised  discourse...and a sizable problem-management industry." (Fromher book, Rocking the Cradle: What Happened When Women  Said Incest.)  What we need to talk about, and  whatLysisencouragingustotalkabout,  is what it means that we spend so much  time, energy, and money on "healing"  and on becoming (through attendance  atpatriarchal institutions) purveyorsof  healing. As a survivor of male violence  and a worker with other survivors, my  original and sustaining passion is to  stop violence against women and children, so that others will not have to live  what I had to live, what too many  women are still living.  Women's individual healing does  not stop male violence. We need to talk  about the social and political implications of having moved from a place of  masses of women publicly naming our  experiences and demanding change, to  great numbers of individual women  sitting in individual therapists' offices  telling their stories to women who,  bound by the rules of their professions,  must keep silent about what is said to  them.  Susan Strega  Coombs, BC  Closing the divide  Kinesis:  I read, with interest, Maureen Trotter's recent letter "Response to  Linkletter" [see Kinesis, Dec. 94], regarding the discounting of rural women  and of the rural feminist movement. I  applaud her constant efforts on our  behalf.  I, too, have felt frustrated and ignored by my urban sisters. When I write  for information and receive no reply,  even when I enclose a self-addressed  stamped envelope. When I phone urban  women's groups and don't get called  back, even when I say to call collect.  When my offers of involvement in feminist activities go unacknowledged (even  by Kinesis). One does begin to feel sometimes like a literal voice in the wilderness!  In the Fall 1993 issue of The Open  Door, a newsletter for rural feminists  and lesbians, I printed an editorial that  included some suggestions for urban  women's groups about how to become  more accessible and responsive to rural  women. I would like to pass these on to  you, and hope that every urban women's group will take the time to discuss  these suggestions among themselves:  • What sort of outreach do you do  for rural women?  • Are your events advertised well  in advance (two months minimum), with  mailing addresses included in the advertising?  •Do you offer childcare and  billetting for your events?  • Do you advertise your group in  rural media, and regularly send information about your group to rural women's groups?  • What portion of your fundraising  isearmarked forrural outreachand support?  • Do you discuss in your group,  how the issues you face might be different for rural women?  • Are you aware of and involved in  environmental and land claim issues in  your bioregion?  • Ifyou have a catalogue of information that your group generates, and is  this information available by mail?  • Do you sell tickets in advance for  your events, do you have arrangements  so that they can be purchased by phone  or mail?  • Do you subscribe to rural women's publications?  • Do you network with rural women's groups that are fighting around the  same issues as your group?  • Do you offer workshops, performances, conferences, etc., in rural locations?  • Do you invite rural feminists to  come and speak with your group about  their issues and lives?  • When you get out of the city, do  you only see it as recreation, or do you  take the opportunity to contact women's groups in the area you are visiting?  Do you make a point of being aware of  the social and economic issues women  face in the places you visit?  • If a rural woman contacts you, are  you as responsive to her requests and  needs as you are to city women?  Judith Quinlan  Burns Lake, BC  ANDREE BUCHANAN  October 20, 1940 - December 20, 1994  Andree was a passionate and unflinching radical feminist.  She said that finding the Wmien's Movement in the 1970s was her liberation.  Andree was one of the founders  of the North Shore Women's Centre  and the Gapilano College Women's  Studies Program. She made a  significant contribution to the  development of the Women's Centre  at Cap College and was a consistent  advocate of college accountability to  the community. While at Cap,  Andree was also on the negotiating  team for her union.  In the 1980s, Andree led support  groups for Battered Women's  Support Services, served a term on  the Vancouver Status of Women  Board, participated in the occupation  of Vancouver Transition House, and  almost single-handedly kept alive  the social issues committee of the  Gazebo Connection.  Out of determination that a  strong lesbian voice be heard, she  was also an instigator of "Lesbians Against the Budget" during  the Solidarity fightback against the Socred government of the  day. Andree spoke out publicly and organized against k'R. E. A.L.  Women's" attacks on lesbians and women's groups.  Andree believed that it is important to honour and support  other feminists'work. She was a prime  organizer of events to appreciate  Rosemary Brown's years of work in  the B.C. Legislature, to celebrate the  efforts of the Transition House  occupiers, and to raise money for a  women's health fund to benefit a  WAVAW-Rape Crisis Centre worker  who was ill.  Andree spoke often of how  grateful she was to Cynthia Flood for  her encouragement to get involved in  the Women's Movement by  participating in the early days of the  NDP women's rights committee. In  her turn, during her past five years'  work at the Women's Research  Centre, Andree spent countless hours  talking with women, listening to their  experience and helping them to find  a group or action that was right for  them.  Andree was proud of the Women's Research Centre and its  commitment to furthering the building of analysis and action  based on women's experience. Both she and the Centre were  renewed and strengthened by the application of her talents  and vision. We miss her.  The political was personal, too: The team of friends and family who supported Andree through the months of illness is especially  appreciative of her honesty, generosity, andopenness, whchmade herdyingan experiencethey couldshareandUearnfrom. Her children,  MichelleandHamish, are grateful for Andree's gentleness and acceptance; they feel they've been motdded by her openness to people and  ideas. Her partner, Jan, cherishes Andree's gifts of incisiveness and challenging candor, as wdl as her playfidness and spirit of  adventure, her tenderness and love.  We honour her.
