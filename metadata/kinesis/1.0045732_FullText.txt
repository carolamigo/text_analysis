Outreach to  Caribbean women  Words of Women is an ambitious project  aiming to promote the exchange of writings between Canadian and Third World  women. In its initial stage, WOW is activating a program of contact and exchange between English-language feminist publishing  groups in Canada and the Caribbean.  Canadian women's groups can become  active participants by linking (via WOW)  with a Caribbean women's group, providing  that group with a continuous supply of feminist literature. Similarly, individuals are invited to form local WOW committees and  forge a connection.  WOW has asked book and periodical publishers to supply them with feminist literature which they will then distribute to Caribbean women's organizations; Caribbean publishers will make a similar exchange to Canadian groups.  WOW is coordinated by MATCH International, a Canadian-based women's organization committed to working with Third  World women for a feminist vision of  development. Contact WOW at Northern Woman's Bookstore, 184 Camelot St.,  Thunder Bay Ont. P7A 4A9, or at MATCH,  1102-200 Elgin St., Ottawa Ont. K2P 1L5  LEAF offers  speakers  West Coast LEAF and the Charter of  Rights Coalition (Vancouver) have created  a Speakers' Bureau which will provide volunteer speakers to address groups on equality rights for women.  LEAF—the Women's Legal Education  and Action Fund—is a national organization which supports court test cases to advance women's equahty under the Charter  of Rights and Freedoms. Their goal is to  help women use the law to effectively redress inequality.  Besides offering the speaker service, West  Coast LEAF is interested in hearing from  members of the community about potential  equahty rights cases.  Groups who would hke a speaker to address either equality rights in general or  some specific application (e.g. workplace issues) are welcome to contact coordinator  Susan Hayne at 733-3382 or the West Coast  LEAF office at 684-8772.

The union has a high proportion of women workers jeopardized  by privatization and victims of low  wages, both of which were major  issues in the strike.  BCGEU workers are between  a rock and a hard place in contract negotiations or on strike.  The media jeers them or pities  them and the government virtuously pretends to be protecting the  taxpayer.  Respect for their work, done  under harassing conditions due  to government pohcies, is rarely  forthcoming. Workers become confused over what union tactics will  be most effective. It is in  this  context the ratification should be  placed.  The new contract strengthens  and extends protections for workers whose jobs are to be privatized,  and includes job options, severance pay and pension protection.  The contract places limitations  on the use of temporary workers too. Now the government will  have to hire office workers and pay  union wages and benefits rather  .     ,.,  ,ITDP  And What A Night It Was ...  Vancouver's Take Back The Night march got an assist from Mother Nature this year in the form  of outraged thunder claps and lightening bolts ... and rain that wouldn't go away. Close to  125 women took over Hastings Street on September 16 and, with an enthusiasm undampened by  dampness, reminded passers-by, motorists—and each other—that the night also belongs to us.  Take Back The Night has been marked across Canada for a decade now. In Toronto this year, the  theme was "Women Fighting Rape: Our Lives, Our Action."  Feminists refuse to network  with R.E.A.L. Women  by Nancy Pollak  Organizers of a Vancouver networking event not only invited the  anti-feminist R.E.A.L. Women,  they structured the event so no effective protest could be launched.  Women in Celebration was held  September 10 at a local community centre. Several feminist  groups were so outraged by the  presence of R.E.A.L. Women and  two other anti-choice groups (including Nurses For Life), they left  in protest.  The DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN), Press Gang Printers and the Vancouver Status of  Women left the gathering not simply angry, but surprised and dismayed.  The event was organized by  an ad-hoc committee of volunteer representatives from various  women's organizations in the lower  mainland. Funding was provided  by the Secretary of State Women's  Program whose local officer, Carol  Anne Soong, was involved in the  event's organizing from the start.  According to organizer JoAn  Maurer, "the mandate from Sec  State was to include all women's  groups." Maurer is the Vancouver  rep for the government- appointed  Canadian Advisory Council on the  Status of Women.  The seed for Women in Celebration was planted at a January networking meeting called  by Pat Cooper, western vice-  president of CACSW. "About  15 women's groups—transition  houses, the YWCA, the University  Women's Club, housing groups  and others— were kicking around  ideas," said Maurer. They decided  on an "inclusive" day-long event  for groups and individuals.  R.E.A.L. Women attended one  planning meeting. "It was awkward," said Maurer."We knew an  event in Vancouver would be controversial ... and the only way  to bring together such a diverse  group was in celebration."  To avoid what Maurer described as a "soap-box environment" ... there would be  no mikes—networking, but no  speaking out."  Maurer cited the 1983 Women  Against the Budget coalition meetings as the kind of atmosphere  they didn't want. "There, some  groups were 'in' and others were  'out.'"  Women in Celebration's agenda  included addresses by Rosemary  Brown and Sylvia Gold (President  of CACSW), a panel of "Women  Speaking Out," film screenings,  and   formal   and   informal   net  working sessions. Over a hundred  women attended.  Each group was given a numbered balloon-on-a-string to be  worn on their representative's  wrist. The numbers corresponded  to the group's name in the program. By this means, women could  seek each other out to network.  "We were not prepared to network with women who are fighting  to destroy everything we've been  working for," said Joan Meister of  DAWN Canada. "By virtue of our  disability we are denied choices,  and that makes us emphatic about  choice. They [R.E.A.L.] Women  aren't going to allow us to choose."  Besides being anti-choice on  abortion, R.E.A.L. Women opposes equal pay for work of equal  value and the gender equahty provision in the Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms. They are  also virulently homophobic.  Sec State's Soong appeared to  have no difficulty with the participation of anti-feminist groups.  "We left it at, invite groups,  you [the organizers] have your  agenda." Soong believes that agenda—"to look at women's accomplishments around equahty, past,  present and future"—was strong  and clear.  See Refuse page 4  than go to Kelly services.  Further improvements are in  adoption leave benefits and clauses  concerning VDT's, giving pregnant women more options for protection. Auxiliary workers will now  be able to specify days and times  of availability for recall.  That's the good news. The bad  news is the wage settlement. On  the surface, an average wage increase of 20 percent over three  years sounds reasonable. It has  been compared favourably to 1988  forest industry settlements of 19  percent.  If you look closer it does  not impress. Nineteen percent of  $15/hour is much greater than of  $10/hour. Office workers, about 25  percent of the union membership,  and financial assistance workers  who process applications for welfare will continue to receive wages  lower than poverty level.  Almost all these workers are  women, many are single parents.  Despite Vander Zalm's statement  that he agreed to improving the  wage of the lowest paid, his ne  gotiators did not adequately do  so because they said they have  no difficulty hiring women at such  wages.  No one is happy with the settlement, not even the union president. The union's alternatives  were limited and difficult. Ii the  membership stayed on strike, a renewed injunction probably would  have led to the permanent denial  of right to strike for corrections  workers and to the signing of highways privatization contracts that  would have left those workers unprotected.  The new protection clauses in  the face of privatization are of  great importance to most members and could have been lost if  this contract was not signed. The  protections will cost the government and are therefore impediments to further privatization.  Given that the B.C. Federation  of Labour's pohtical battle to stop  privatization has gone nowhere,  this was the most many union  members felt could be achieved.  Kinesis survey  results now in  by Allisa McDonald  Over 260 Kinesis readers responded to the Reader Survey included in the June 1988 issue—a  return rate of more than 16 percent! Thanks to all those who took  the time to give us their feedback.  Thanks also to the volunteers who  helped tabulate the results.  Due to the unprecedented response, we have not been able to  tabulate every reply. The results  here are drawn from a sample of  100 replies received before July 15.  Of course there's no such thing  as an "average" Kinesis reader.  However, based on the data, we  can begin to sketch a profile of a  "typical" survey respondent. Let  me introduce you.  The typical respondent is a  thirty-nine year old, white woman,  university educated, earning  around $ 22,000/year. If she is currently employed (we didn't ask)  she's either a professional or involved in some kind of artistic or  creative work. She hves in a large  city—most likely Vancouver. She  is probably a tenant but has a  good chance (44 percent) of owning her own home. She shares her  home with one other adult and has  no dependents. Besides Kinesis,  she reads The Vancouver Sun,  McLean's, Ms., and The Globe  & Mail.  So, how do we rate? Most readers we heard from seemed to hke  the paper. Enough so that 95 percent get it every month and share  it with one or two other people.  The large majority feel Kinesis is  priced fairly (78 percent) and 13  percent feel it's a bargain.  The most popular part of the  paper was the "Across B.C." section, with "Arts" and "Movement  Matters" in close pursuit. A frequent gripe was how late in the  month Kinesis reaches some subscribers. We're working on that,  has anybody noticed? There were  requests for more investigative reporting, as well as analysis and  commentary. And while 5 percent  want more fashion articles, 4 percent don't want fashion at all.  Readers were asked to rate Kinesis coverage of sixteen different  topics. Coverage of abortion got  the highest rating (39 percent said  Excellent, 37 percent said Good)  and coverage of the environment  the lowest (35 percent said it was  Fair).  Nearly half the respondents (49  percent) use Kinesis for research,  mostly on women's sexual and  reproductive rights, but also on  a wide range of issues, including  daycare, health, pornography, sexual and physical violence, and human rights here and abroad. Kinesis is often used for statistical,  see Survey page 6  "That's 3 concerts, 1 conference and a poetry reading that  happened before we got our Kinesis. Wow, VSW just saved us  another $85."  KINESIS Across B.C.  Housing for women  Coalition active as watchdog  by Barbara Wild  "Pretty desperate" is how Joan  LeClair, spokeswoman for the  recently-formed British Columbia  Women's Housing Coalition, describes the current housing situation for women in Vancouver.  "Some studies show more than  17,000 people on massive waiting hsts for non-profit and co-op  housing, with the hsts consisting  mostly of single mothers and single mature women," says LeClair.  The B.C. Women's Housing  Coalition came out of the Women  and Housing Forum held last  May in Vancouver. Composed  of women from women's centres,  housing groups and concerned individuals, the Coalition's agenda  is twofold: to educate both themselves and the public around the  issue of housing as a right, and to  address any immediate situations  in the Lower Mainland affecting  housing for women.  Eventually, BCWHC hopes to  involve all of B.C., perhaps assisting other groups in getting started.  The Coalition's concerns were  made known at recent Vancouver  City Council hearings regarding  the Pacific Place (False Creek) development. Marlene Healy, on behalf of the Coalition, called for 50  percent social housing.  ("Social housing," also known  as non-profit housing, affordable  housing, and public housing, usually means housing that is government subsidized and not intended  for profit-making. Co-op housing is  one form of social housing.)  Speaking to Council, Healy said  her group's concerns centered on  housing mix, livability and public  amenities, creek and soil toxicity,  and community consultation. The  guidelines subsequently passed by  Council fell far short of those put  forward by the Coalition.  Also of interest to BCWHC is  the non-criteria women's shelter  being proposed by the Downtown  Eastside Women's Centre.  Most shelters or hostels, such  as transition houses for battered  women, drug and alcohol or mental health facilities, are designed  for people who fall into specific "categories." A non-criteria  women's shelter would open its  doors to any woman in need of a  place to stay.  In the week preceding the issue of welfare cheques, DEWC—  which is not a residential facility—  has up to 100 women coming in every day. When staff goes home at  5 o'clock, the women are forced to  leave. Many of them are homeless,  sleeping outside, in hotel rooms, at  friends.' H anything goes wrong—  and it often does—they have no  place to go.  The proposed shelter would alleviate this situation. However, as  far as the planning goes, "we still  don't have a core group," said  staffer Pam Cooley. "Nothing has  been decided yet, location, funding, etc ... The staff of DEWC  does not have the womanpower to  provide leadership for this project.  We need all the help we can get,  especially people who are good at  fund-raising."  BCWHC is also paying attention to events in Surrey. The  Red  Door  Housing  Society  re-  see Housing page 6  Giving ourselves credit  Joy Thompson of the clinic coalition  Everywoman's Health  Centre opens soon  by Diane Strandberg  Women's community-based  businesses are finally going to get  the credit they deserve.  The Community Economic Options group of WomenSkills has established a loan guarantee fund to  help groups of women start enterprises. Called WomenFutures,  the fund is being launched October 24 at a community dinner event at Isadora's Restaurant on Granville Island.  According to fund organizer  Lucy Alderson, WomenFutures  has arrived not a moment too  soon. This year Alderson and her  colleagues talked with groups of  women starting community enterprises to find out their needs. They  found financing to be a major barrier to developing new enterprises,  particularly those which operate  as a collective.  "Our work with community-  based business has shown us how  httle infrastructure there is to encourage this kind of development,  especially when compared to the  encouragement of individually-  owned enterprises," Alderson said.  Conventional banks just don't  acknowledge the principle of collective decision-making. They also  don't understand a business that  would focus on creating jobs with  good working conditions as its  first priority, rather than increasing profits.  "As we visited enterprises that  grew out of women's centres, transition houses and kitchen table  conversations, we found women  were trying to create jobs for  themselves and a way of working  that made sense to them," said  Alderson.  These groups turned to creative  ways to raise money because they  found banks, conventional loaning  agencies and so-called "last resort  funders" such as the Federal Business Development Bank unresponsive. But they were often unsuccessful in their attempts.  WomenFutures' Melanie Conn  explains the purpose of the WomenFutures fund is to make it easier for groups to access credit so  they can get their projects up and  running. "Groups will find it much  easier to get a loan from a financial institution because WomenFutures will guarantee a portion of  the loan. Of course," Conn adds,  "we'll require a business plan from  the group which demonstrates the  project's feasibility."  The heart of WomenFutures is  a pool of returnable contributions  and donations available for use as  guarantees for women's economic  projects. Although fund organizers do not anticipate that guarantees will be called in to cover  by Lea Dawson  At a news conference September  10, the B.C. Coalition of Abortion  Clinics announced they had used  a $50,000 privately raised fund  to purchase a medical building in  Vancouver to house a clinic.  CaUed "Everywoman's Health  Centre," the clinic is close to major hospitals, is wheelchair and  ambulance accessible, and can be  secured against violent attacks.  The organizers of the centre  have a feminist basis of unity and  a vision of a community-based,  community-run facility that provides a variety of health services,  including abortion. While the centre board is presently made up  of the BCCAC steering committee and clinic staff, their goal is to  integrate volunteers from as many  different backgrounds as possible.  The exact location of the clinic  and opening date remain confidential at present to protect women  who will use the service. Joy  Thompson of the BCCAC hopes  "the anti-choice lobby will respect  the chnic," but anticipates picketing and protests.  The chnic building was selected  with security in mind, and has  been described as "not unlike a  wartime bunker." A security service will be hired and volunteers  trained to escort women and to  protect the site.  According to Thompson, the  chnic location will be disclosed  at a public opening in October.  Women's organizations and the  medical community will also be informed of the location to ensure a  comprehensive referral system.  After the announcement of the  clinic's purchase, the B.C. Ministry of Health said they would not  cover the costs of the abortion procedure in the clinic under the Medical Services Plan. (Estimated at  $200 per abortion, these costs are  covered in hospitals). Should the  clinic charge women for procedural  costs, the Ministry would consider  it "extra-billing" and has threatened to refuse to pay doctors' fees  (estimated at $106 for a pregnancy  under 14 weeks).  The clinic organizers reassure  women that no one will be turned  Lend the clinic a hand...  If you want to ensure the chnic is a success, contact the B.C. Coalition for Abortion Clinics at 873-5455.

For example: Cantonese, Punjabi, Spanish, Greek, French  • Raise funds by all available means  • Gather and/or produce educational materials for use in the clinic  • Help recruit members and supporters  away from the chnic because she  cannot afford an abortion.  Hilda Thomas of the BCCAC  has called on the provincial government "to provide full coverage  under MSP for the Everywoman's  Health Centre," and the Coalition has approached both the B.C.  Civil Liberties Association and the  Legal Education and Action Fund  (LEAF) to take on their case for  full funding.  Since the Supreme Court decision this winter, the focus of  the BCCAC has been to raise  funds for a free-standing chnic,  and this work continues. More  money is needed to cover insurance, salaries, security services,  etc. The clinic also needs volunteers (see Box), and encourages  women to contribute their energy  and their skills.  loans, only a portion of the money  in the fund will be used for guarantees. The WomenFutures account  will be housed at CCEC Credit  Union, which has a commitment  to support community-based business projects.

Women] some education," said Soong. "I'm the  perpetual optimist—maybe some  people will learn something."  VSW's Janet Shaw arrived at  the event and was immediately  alarmed by R.E.A.L. Women and  the anti-abortion groups' "visible presence—they had tables,  posters, literature." VSW had previously been told there would be  no tables for displays.  Dismay at the presence of right-  wing groups wasn't the day's  only disappointment. Said Darsnin  Mann of the India Mahila Association, "There was nothing of  use there for immigrant women.  The whole thing was very organized, very pre-planned. I felt it  was hopeless from a feminist point  of view."  KINESIS Across B.C.  Workers get Triple-O's at White Spot  by Terrie Hamazaki  Bill 19, B.C.'s Industrial Relations Reform Act is undermining collective bargaining and  contributing to union-busting at  White Spot, say striking restaurant workers.  Strike action commenced August 27 when the Canadian Association of Industrial, Mechanical  and Allied Workers Local 112 rejected the company's final contract  offer by 87 percent.  After two weeks on the picket  hne, workers were compelled under the terms of BUI 19 to vote  again after the company applied  to the Industrial Relations Coun-  cU (IRC) for a final offer vote.  The second vote, taken by a  smaUer membership, resulted in 67  percent in favour of rejection.  "Votes are taken by how many  come out to the meetings. The second final offer vote was very significant because 658 of 970 people  voted 'no,' even after the company  did a campaign on people saying  'this is as far as we're going, this is  fair'," said Denise CaUaghan, National Union Staff Representative  of CAIMAW.  "The IRC did not do anything  to assist in proper negotiations,"  said Maggie Morris of CAIMAW.  The union has applied to the Ombudsman (sic) for an internal investigation after a sworn affidavit  by one of the members cites Ken  Albertini, IRC Acting Commissioner, as trying to influence final  offer voting.  "Scheduhng by seniority, protection against contracting out,  and management doing excessive  bargaining-unit work have been  union demands. Monetary issues  had never been discussed in bargaining," said CaUaghan.  "Wages only became an issue  when the company dropped their  final offer on the table and ... left.  Our position had never even been  discussed."  "The company would always  schedule the junior person ahead  of the senior, give them more  hours, call them in for any overtime," said LiUian Baron, waitress  at White Spot since 1971.  Contracting out is a major  problem. "There are three janitors with 25 years seniority among  them, and they're given two days  notice that they're being demoted  to dishwasher because of nonunion outfitting coming in," said  CaUaghan. "Also, managers would  frequently hostess at the front  door for three hours, when the  hostess' hours are being cut back."  "BiU 19 got us here," said Morris. "Everyone [employers] tries to e.  keep the union out. We set the -I  standard for other restaurants. If gi  we get nothing, then the others get T?|  nothing."  According to Baron, a union  is definitely needed. "Especially  with different changes in management and owners," she said. The  White Spot chain (19 unionized  and 11 non-unionized restaurants)  is owned by Peter Toigo, a close  associate of premier Vander Zalm.  For Local 112, whose members  are primarUy women, the dispute  has only strengthened their resolve  to defend their union rights. Their  concern is not only for themselves.  "The company compares us aU  the time with unorganized restaurants," said CaUaghan. "The hospitality industry is one of the  largest industries in the province.  People within should be organized  and it's our goal to see that even-  tuaUy they are."  "We are prepared to bargain,"  said CaUaghan.

As the trial drew to a close,  T.V., radio and newspaper reporters crammed into the Toronto  courtroom, spiUing out into the  lobby and the shopping maU and  underground parking lot below.  The reporters were jockeying  for position to cover the conclusion of the trial of Kirby Inwood,  former advertising executive, now  convicted wife and chUd assaulter.  After a lengthy trial, provincial  court Judge Gordon Hachborn had  been convinced Inwood was guilty  of assault causing bodUy harm to  his wife Tatyana Sidorova, and of  a lesser charge of common assault  to their infant son Misha.  Hachborn then sentenced Inwood to a mere 30 days in jaU  for the assault on Misha—Inwood  could be out in as few as 10—and  required him to undergo psychiatric treatment.  As far as the media was concerned, it couldn't have been a  better story. Inwood met and "feU  in love" with Sidorova whUe trav-  eUing to the Soviet Union several  years ago and they married. Upon  his return, alone, to Canada, he  mounted a publicity campaign to  have her released from the USSR  In September of 1987 she arrived with their baby. Ten days  later, Inwood was arrested for assault after attacking Sidorova and  among other things, twice dropping Misha on his head.  For Sidorova, it could be argued  the worst was yet to come.  "The legal system protects the  defendant to a much greater extent than the woman who is the  victim," says Paula Klein of the  Barbra Schhfer Chnic, provider of  legal services for assaulted women.  During the trial, Sidorova was viciously interrogated by Inwood's  lawyer Edward Greenspan who did  everything possible to try and destroy her credibility.  Klein says this is typical of  such cases. And although Judge  Hachborn aUowed Greenspan to  licized. But it can and does happen that women feel hke they are  on trial. The damage is done in  cases hke this before the verdict  ever comes down. It is not only  a horrendous experience in court,  but somehow it validates the abuse  a woman receives in the first place  to experience how society accepts  and condones the victimization of  women in court."  More happUy, the media's zealous coverage did make more people aware of the issue, Don says.  "Not aU coverage was positive, but  it got public attention and made  More happily, the media's zealous  coverage did make more people  aware of the issue  question Sidorova's character and  past Ufe, he would not aUow the  testimony of five women who had  also been brutaUy assaulted by Inwood untU the sentencing hearing.  Trudy Don of the Ontario Association of Interval and Transition  Houses said, "We were absolutely  horrified with the way Greenspan  prosecuted the victim. Because of  the way she was treated, women  may be frightened from going  through with court proceedings."  Klein concurs. "In reality most  trials don't last for weeks and  months and aren't so highly pub-  more people aware that wife assault is a criminal offence."  Klein hopes that this increased  awareness wUl cause people to  change the legal system. Most  women don't even want a heavy  verdict, she says, they just want  the abuse to stop.  And now what of Sidorova? A  strong woman, she has survived  and returned to school so she can  get a good job and raise her son.  But she is stiU afraid of Inwood  and wants the laws to change.  "Somebody must protect women,"  said Sidorova,  KINESIS Across Canada  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Gwen Bird  Deported woman  blames unfair  recruitment  A Filipina woman who came to  Canada in 1980 after being recruited as a seamstress by a Winnipeg company was deported in  late August. Told by recruiters  that only single women were eligible for the positions, Sally Espineli  Ued about her marital status, got  the job and came to Canada.  Although marital status is a  prohibited ground of discrimination in the Immigration Act,  %  to  m  when immigration officials discovered Espineli was married they ordered her deported to ManUa for  entering Canada fraudulently.  The Canadian Human Rights  Commission asked that Espineli be  aUowed to remain in Canada un-  tU the commission has heard her  case, but the request was denied.  Espineli hopes the deportation  order wUl be reversed on appeal  if the commission rules the con-  Houslng from page 4 -  ceived conditional aUocation from  the province for 46 units of social  housing in Newton. Although the  project was finally passed Sept. 19  by Surrey Municipal CouncU, it  had been denied three weeks earlier.  Objections to the scheme centered around existing "social problems" in the school closest to  the designated site. Some school  dition of her recruitment was Ule-  gal. Her lawyer says "the government is ignoring its own legislation," and adds that many workers recruited from abroad are told  they must be single.  Child Care Act  roundly panned  The federal Conservatives' proposed chUd-care legislation has  met with criticism from a wide  range of groups Who state the bUl  would impede the quality of chUd  care.  The Canada ChUd Care Act  outhnes federal-provincial agreements to provide chUd care, including a complex formula for  cost-sharing.  A parliamentary committee  heard from a variety of groups  whose most widespread criticism  was the lack of any national  standards in the bill. Groups  such as the Canadian Teachers  Federation, The Canadian Labor Congress, the Canadian Jewish Congress, Anti-Poverty groups,  and the Canadian Union of Pub-  he Employees aU oppose the legislation.  The National Action Committee on the Status of Women told  the committee the bUl was so  flawed it was unamendable.  Native groups were also very  critical of the proposal, charging  the government is missing a chance  to show it is sincere about Indian self-government. Native government is not included as a type  of government to be considered in  the task of dividing up chUd care  responsibilities. The Assembly of  First Nations submitted amendments to include Native governments.  As Kinesis goes to press, the  Tories are trying to push the act  through the Commons, whUe the  Senate warns it may take up to a  month to consider the bUl.  Steel-working  woman receives  settlement  An out-of-court settlement has  been reached in the case of a  HamUton, Ontario woman who  filed suit against the Steel Company of Canada (Stelco) citing sexual harassment as a health and  safety hazard on the job.  Bonita Clark, employed as a  pump tender since 1979, had the  support of the Ontario Worker's  Health Centre in her action  against Stelco. As a woman in a  traditionally male occupation, she  was harassed repeatedly and molested several times by a male supervisor.  Clark wanted to quit her job  due to the resulting stress, so she  set out to establish sexual harassment as a health and safety issue  for employees.  Clark filed complaints with the  Ontario Human Rights Commission and the Ontario Labor Relations Board. She received help  from Toronto lawyer Mary Cornish, and a group of supporters  who raised over $25,000 to defray  legal costs.  The terms of the settlement are  confidential. Although no OLRB  ruling was made on the health and  safety matter, Cornish stated that  the case, its proceedings and publicity aU constituted good progress  on the issue. In Quebec, the workers compensation board recognizes  sexual harassment as a health and  safety hazard.  Legal abuses  tackled by  lesbians, gays  An Ottawa-based lobby group  has been awarded $25,000 to fight  cases of discrimination against lesbian and gay Canadians.  Equahty for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere (EGALE) has  begun work in five areas of federal law "that may discriminate  on the ground of sexual orientation." EGALE received five $5,000  case development grants from the  federal Secretary of State-funded  Court Challenges Program.  board members pointed to the single working mother as a source  of these problems and questioned  whether they wanted more of these  women (and their chUdren) in the  community.

The Canada Health Act wUl be  examined for ways in which it may  aUow discrimination, "particulary  in fight of the many abuses AIDS  has brought to light." The Canadian Human Rights Act wUl be  challenged for its faUure to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the Immigration Act wUl be contested in a  number of areas.  The group states that although  the federal funding wUl not cover  nearly the full cost of the project,  this acknowledgement of the importance of lesbian and gay rights  by a respected group of legal and  human rights experts is a significant advance in itself.  Privacy  measure upheld  The Supreme Court of Canada  has ruled that a law prohibiting  the publication of names of sexual  assault victims is constitutional.  The decision came after a hearing in which freedom of the press,  open justice and the victim's right  to privacy were the main issues.  The court's ruling acknowledged that sexual assault is one  of the most unreported crimes and  that fear of publicity and embarrassment are two of the main reasons women give for not reporting  this offence.  Section 442.3 of the Criminal  Code, which women's groups had  fought long and hard for, requires  a judge to prohibit publication of  a complainant's name—or clues to  her identity—when requested to  do so during a trial.  The Ontario Supreme Court ordered such a ban in a 1983 case  in Thunder Bay, and a newspaper successfuUy appealed the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The federal Justice Department then appealed that ruhng to  the Supreme Court of Canada.  Reproductive  technology  report  A government-sponsored report  on new reproductive technologies  criticizes surrogate-mother contracts for focusing on property  rights and paternity instead of  "women's health, women's relationship to chUdren or women's reproductive choice."  Women and Reproductive  Technologies was produced for  the federal ministry responsible for  the status of women. Although it  was intended to stimulate public  debate, the study has been kept  under wraps.  Written by Somer Brodrib of  the Ontario Institute for Studies  in Education, the report looks at  surrogacy, gender selection, artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization and at how these changes  in technology are affecting women.  It states that most of the work in  this area has been to assert men's  ownership and paternity rights  and that chUdren are commodified  by the process.  The report also notes that the  channelling of funds into high- tech  procedures on behalf of the economically advantaged infertUe is a  dangerous trend. It asks "wUl the  poor and less privUeged be unable  to choose to bear their own chUdren?" if funds for day care and  other parental support services are  not made a priority.  KINESIS Across Canada  Still not enough  Big bucks and plenty of pamphlets  by Noreen Shanahan  Wife Assault—two words liberally  sprinkled around Toronto these days. Pamphlets containing them can be found in  liquor and grocery stores as weU as medical  offices, with translations in Chinese, Portuguese, Italian, Greek and Spanish.  Eleven provincial ministries, forming the  Interministerial Committee on Services Related to Wife Assault, have targeted part of  their 1988 budgets for this education package, produced by the Ontario Women's Directorate.  The package includes wider pamphlet  distribution (of "Wife Assault: It is a  Crime" and "Let's Break the SUence"),  T.V. ads in French and English, posters  aimed at men who batter, and outreach to  various ethnic communities.

"Most  projects involve a steering committee rep-  &es*ence  WIFE ASSAULT:  ft is a ciime.  resenting several women's organizations  knowledgeable about the issue and for the  culture and language," said Betty Notar,  poUcy analyst for the Directorate.  While many women might appreciate their realities being addressed, Kate  Clark of Toronto's Education Wife Assault (EWA)—a non-profit feminist group  providing information, training and education—says this campaign is doing battered  women more harm than good.  She's In A Jam ...  "It's huge. They're putting millions of dollars into this media blitz, and you see these  brochures everywhere, but at the same time  they're not putting more money into services."  For instance, the Assaulted Women's Crisis hne phone number is weU-puDlicized, she  said, but there aren't enough people or services to deal with the increased number  of women calling. (Despite repeated efforts  Kinesis was unable to reach anyone at this  Une.)  Wendy Barrett, an instructor at Toronto's George Brown CoUege and battered  women's activist, is also critical of the Ontario government. She says they're taking  money out of battered women's shelters and  advising the women to use mental health  centres instead, for counselling.  "It's another example of professionaliza-  tion [of assaulted women's services]; the  money is going to social workers instead of  shelter workers." The result of this shift, she  says, is fewer safe places to refer women.  According to Barrett, the government is  also considering limiting a woman's stay in  a shelter to six weeks, which would create  in effect a "bed-and-breakfast" situation for  battered women. This restriction would hit  Toronto women, who are already experiencing a severe housing shortage, particularly  hard.  Faced with the Toronto housing crisis,  some shelters are forming alliances with  co-operative housing developments where a  percentage of crisis units are specificaUy al-  loted battered women and their chUdren.  There are five shelters in Metro Toronto  accommodating approximately one hundred  women and chUdren. For every woman provided for, nine others are turned away,  according to EWA's Clark. "Not a lot  of women go through the shelters," she  said. "People focus on shelters, but millions  haven't [gone to them]. In many cases, if a  woman has no accommodation with friends  or family, she's in a jam."  Alone and Unfamiliar  Almost immediately after leaving Nigeria in  1987 to join her husband in Toronto, two  things happened to Roselynn Aina: she became pregnant with her first chUd and her  husband began to beat her.  Alone and unfamiliar with the city, Aina  was nine months pregnant before neighbours called the pohce and she was brought  to Shirley Samaroo House, the only immigrant women's shelter in Canada.  Escaping the violence at home, she'd ride  the subway back and forth untU her hus  band would either calm down, faU asleep or  leave for work.

The women  are Linda Danniels and Ana Maria Santinoli, actors in Fires of Transformation, a play  written and performed by survivors of wife assault, for survivors of wife assault (and also  to give the general audiences a chance to hear their stories and watch their strengths).  Fires is a two act, ten actor play, born in the livingrooms of Toronto transition houses,  where the women first used improvisation to script their experiences. Calling themselves  the VOICE troupe (Violence Overcome In Creative Ensemble) the play explores and exposes domestic violence—from which these women escaped—and the insidious societal violence each continues to face.  "The group wanted to deal with what happens to a woman after she leaves the violent (home) situation," said director/producer Katherine MarieUe. "They often face more  abuse from the legal system. Lawyers, judges, psychiatrists and others subject women to  character defamation. The women are put on trial though they are the victims of crime."  One poignant role, created and performed by Santolini, is of a transient 'bag lady' who  appears as a guiding Ught throughout both acts. "I was fascinated by bag ladies," said Santolini. "Very strong women who want absolute freedom. They rebel against the system—  but there is also something frightening about it. You have to give up everything."  She says this character was a middle class woman who lost everything as a result of  abuse, was institutionalized and ended up alone in the street. "This character gave us a  chance to exercise our own feehngs about her: why do we identify with or reject her? I had  felt I could be her," said Santolini.  Fires began performing last May primarUy in Toronto transition houses where the  women responded "as though looking in a mirror," said MarieUe. An overwhelming message to the troupe was "take it to the government!" It later premiered for general audiences in Toronto's New Theatre Centre.  Future VOICE plans tentatively include producing an educational kit for transition  houses, encouraging other women to bring their experiences to hfe; the kit would include  a video on the making of Fires. Other plans involve re-staging Fires in Toronto this faU,  forming a new troupe and mounting a national caravan tour (including chUdren) to both  rural and urban audiences.

KINESIS International  South Africa  A long history of "picking up the spears  95  by Sadie Kuehn  A packed house of 250 gathered at the  Vancouver YWCA on Sunday, August 7 to  join with women around the world in celebrating South African Women's Day.  The date of South African Women's Day  was chosen to celebrate the 1956 march  on Pretoria by 20,000 women of aU races  to protest the South African government's  pass laws.  The keynote speaker for the Vancouver  celebration was Susan Mnumzana, an African National Congress (ANC) representative to the United Nations.  Sadie: Could you give us an overview  of the events of 1956 and the impact it  has had on the situation in general in  South Africa.  Susan: 1956 was the cUmax of a very  involved, protracted struggle. When South  Africa was a British colony—and it stiU was  in 1956—the British introduced the pass  system as early as 1913. They wanted aU  Black South Africans in particular Africans,  to carry passes. Women resisted, in Bloom-  fontein, as early as 1913.  This law was relaxed to a certain extent  untU after the [Second World] War when the  Nationalist party in 1948 took over power.  Strijdom, who was then Prime Minister,  wanted to extend the pass laws to women.  Women—having seen the devastation  and misery that goes together with the arrest of husbands, fathers, brothers and serv-  m  ing long jaU sentences and their famines  not even being told where these people are  held—felt this was going to have a really  devastating effect on the family, the fabric  of chUd-rearing.  As you can weU imagine, if both mother  and father are arrested and, in the extended  family, aunts and uncles are arrested for  pass law offences, then the chUdren are left  on their own. This prompted women—of aU  races—in South Africa to protest against  these passes.  It is important to give a brief background to what led South Africans of aU  races to march on Pretoria. The 1950's  saw a new era in the struggle against  apartheid—against colonialism in general—  where the different racial groups organized  themselves, together with the African majority. The Indian People's Congress (IPC)  was formed, the Coloured People's Congress  (CPC), and the Congress of Democrats  (CD)—that was a white organization—and  the African National Congress (ANC) came  together.  This is the period of the defiance campaign in 1952 that lasted up to 1956, with  the clampdown on the leadership. In 1956,  156 leaders of the Congress alliance were  arrested. It was during this period that  women in the ANC Women's League and  the people in the CPC, IPC and CD came  together and decided on a march to Pretoria, protesting not only against the pass  laws—although those laws were the major issue of the time—but really it was a  protest against apartheid and the oppression of Black people in general.  It was very significant because for the i  first time, South Africa was united as South  Africa with aU its people protesting against  an unjust system. Thus, you found 20,000  women of aU races marching on Pretoria to  register their protest against the extension  of the pass laws.  Campaign of Defiance  This had a tremendous impact on South  Africans of all walks of hfe. They realized  for the first time that not only have women  got the power, but the majority of the people of South Africa could flex their muscle  and they could bring down the government.  The result of this campaign and this  march was that for the next two or  three years the extension of the passes  stopped. When they eventuaUy did extend  the passes, it generated protests that ch-  maxed with the 1960 SharpeviUe massacre,  the outlawing of the ANC and the Congress  alliance, and the movement going underground.  The Federation of South African Women,  (the organizers of the march), was an  umbreUa group that embraced the ANC  Women's League, the Coloured people, the  Indians and the whites. That's why you  see that the leaders of this demonstration  were Lihian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Shanthie  Naidoo, Deborah Mabale.  All of these women have a history behind  them. Helen Joseph, for example, was the  first woman in South Africa to be held under house arrest in 1952. That is when the  defiance campaign against the pass laws was  beginning.

The regime actually  felt the effect of these operations. Hence,  they were looking for excuses to outlaw the  movement. They tried it with the treason  trial, which dragged on for four years, after which aU charges against aU defendants  were dropped. Then the SharpeviUe massacre came, and they found reason to outlaw the ANC.  The Federation of Women was not  banned as such. The same applies to  the other Congresses. They weren't really  banned, but because the leadership was arrested and forced into exile, these movements became defunct to a considerable degree. For some time you could say there was  a pohtical lull, if not a pohtical vacuum, because it was very difficult to organize underground at the time.  Sadie: Has that changed at present?  Susan: The people themselves in South  Africa have forced a change through struggles. 1967-68 saw the birth of what is now  it, every demonstration, every riot was attacked violently and there were casualties.  I am not talking about people just being  wounded or arrested; people were shot dead.  The climax came with the Soweto uprising  when school chUdren took to the streets,  demonstrating against apartheid, against  the imposition of Afrikaans as a language of  instruction. Their protest ended in a bloodbath.  The struggle has not stopped since then.  People have learned new tactics and with  the heightening pohtical consciousness, our  people began to realize that it is not the  white skin that is a problem—it's the system.  You found an increasing number of white  people also joining the struggle. And those  activists who became inactive as a result  of the repression foUowing the SharpeviUe  massacre also came back to continue with  the struggle.  Today we find legal, multiracial organizations hke the United Democratic Front  The unity among Black people has cost the  government a lot... it is expensive to maintain  the repressive machinery  called the Black Consciousness Movement.  This was a very necessary development.  The aim of the Black Consciousness Movement was to reactivate the fighting spirit  in the Black masses. Not only that, but to  teach Black people again that they were  worth being human beings and that what  the South African government was doing—  dehumanizing them—was not right.  So the Black Consciousness Movement  was very positive. It did not even see itself as a hberation movement. I was a part  of the Black Consciousness Movement, and  we didn't realize and accept that people hke  Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Bram  Fischer were our leaders.  What we were doing was picking up their  spears and continuing the fight. We may  have used different methods—because already the ANC had decided to embark on  armed struggle—but as a legal organization  inside South Africa it was risky to start advocating armed struggle.  Complete Chaos  But because the regime is always frightened  when it sees people being organized against  (UDF) and the Congress of South African  Trade Unions (COSATU) and this is an  achievement considering the efforts of the  government through legislation hke the  Group Areas Act and others to really polarize the different racial groups in South  Africa This unity among Black people,  among the democratic forces in the country,  has cost the government a lot in terms of  pohtical disorganization, in terms of money,  because it is expensive to maintain the repressive machinery. There is also the war  they are waging against Angola, against  Mozambique, and other front Une States.  And so you find complete chaos in the  South African ruhng circles. Of course, this  makes them even more aggressive, as you  have seen on television screens, especiaUy  during 1984-85. And the people are fighting back, and because they are fighting back  and there are casualties on both sides, the  government decides to impose the state of  emergency, restrictions on the press, and so  on.

Pinochet and his foUowers probably had  the picture of a peaceful ChUe in mind when  mounting their farcical plebiscite. They  probably thought the event itself and its  surrounding activities would confuse people enough to keep them at home; or that  this beginning of the "democratic process"  would make everybody happy.  They were probably right when thinking  of confusion, but they were certainly mistaken to think people would happUy stay  home. The announcement of the plebiscite  and, more specifically, the announcement of  the "candidate" has brought the people of  ChUe to a state of pohtical effervescence not  seen for years.  August 29 to September 4 saw massive  protests in downtown Santiago and other  cities, whUe smaUer demonstrations have  been happening almost everyday, everywhere in the country. At the same time, the  Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front and other  armed groups have increased their operations during this period.  Right wing groups reacted to the plebiscite with a certain degree of rehef. Finally,  they thought, civUians could become active  participants in the government. However,  when it became clear that Pinochet would  be the only candidate, some groups decided  to vote, "no" on October 5.  The Christian Democratic Party and the  social-democratic forces were clear about  a "no" vote from the very beginning and  prompted their foUowers to put their names  in the official registry. If the "no" wins, they  wUl be weU equipped to negotiate with both  the U.S. administration and the ChUean  military whUe playing a prominent role in a  subsequent "opening" of the pohtical scene.  The powerful movement created by these  two pohtical forces convinced an important sector of the left to join their campaign for the "no" at a fairly early stage in  the process. In the meantime, the Communist Party, an important organization of the  ChUean working class, continued to deliberate. Finally, in early September, the CP decided to join the "no" forces.  However, a smaU but important part of  the left, including a sector of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), has  decided to boycott the plebiscite and denounce it as another one of Pinochet's  games." Since Pinochet holds aU the cards,  they claim, they are not playing.  They were mistaken  to think people would  happily stay home  Women Take The Lead  Monday August 29: more than one thousand women took over CaUe Ahumada,  Santiago's busiest boulevard. They carried  black human sUhouettes with the names of  victims of the dictatorship. People on the  street were initiaUy puzzled by these women  and their companions, but as soon as they  understood the meaning of the sUent march,  they started to applaud.  The women, belonging to the organization "Women for Life," were clear in their  message: the "disappeared," the executed,  the pohtical prisoners and the exUes were  walking through downtown Santiago again,  even if it was just symbolically.  It did not take long for the carabineros  (mUitary poUce) to show up and fiU the air  with tear gas. The water cannon tank made  its way through the march and kept on attacking the black sUhouettes, now leaning  against the trees, as if they were also a "danger to society."  At one point, Carmen Gloria Quintana  attempted to march again holding up the  By now, thousands of protesters ]  joined the students and the women, including the CUT (Unified Labour Federation)  and other organizations. That evening, the  protesters not only clashed with the pohce  but also with some 8,000 Pinochet supporters who had also made it to the streets.  As twilight approached, the barrios got  ready. When 8:00 struck, people with pots  and pans made their way onto the streets  and out of doors and windows, and the  banging began. The young and the old gathered old chairs, pieces of wood, tires, baskets  and the bonfires were fit. The atmosphere  was one of a feast, of a noisy feast. The fight  of the barricades in aU of the Santiago barrios fit the sky and the marches continued.  The massive demonstrations of Septem  ber would seem to say it is not possible. But  the regime could resort to fraud, given that  it owns the rules of the game and has total  control over the process.  And, if the "no" actuaUy wins: what  changes wUl that bring about? Hasn't the  dictatorship already set the itinerary to follow if this is the case? Doesn't that itinerary  state that the armed forces wUl stiU play a  key role in the years to come?

Carmen Gloria  survived but Rodrigo died.) She was able to  go on for only a few meters before the deluge of water reached her.  As twilight approaches,  the barrios got ready  At this point, it was not only women  who were attempting to march again. Men  had joined in and everybody was shouting "asesinos, asesinos" (murderers, murderers). The protest lasted for more than an  hour and 26 people were arrested.  Birth Of A New Spirit  Tuesday, August 30: the candidate was  to be announced. Everybody knew it would  be Pinochet, but stiU ... Since early morning the carabineros patroUed the city centre.  They knew the atmosphere of expectancy  could turn into one of protest at any moment.  Shortly after 11 am students left their  schools and began to gather. The organization "Agrupacion de FamUiares de De-  tenidos Desaparecidos" (Relatives of Disap-  peared-Pohtical Prisoners) left the Vicariate  of Solidarity office and started leafletting.  Shortly after 12 the first confrontations between the carabineros and the protesters be-  gan.    For many, this was their first protest in 15  years; there were so many people the carabineros and all their fancy equipment could  not stop them.  That August 30, three people were kUled  by the pohce, 121 were wounded and 847  detained. However, the end result of this  extraordinary day was the birth of a new  spirit. "People are not scared any more,"  said one of the young shanty-town dweUers.  His statement was to be confirmed over and  over again in the next few days.  September 4, 1970 was the day that  Salvador AUende was elected President of  ChUe. September 4, 1988 hundreds of thousands fiUed the streets to commemorate the  anniversary and demand the dictator leave.  October 5: And Then What?  In spite of the visible opposition and resistance to the dictatorship, it is evident the  Pinochet regime is stiU very strong. In addition to its repressive strength, its economic  model has found support not only in the upper classes but also in some middle sectors  who, enjoying some economic stabUity, fear  a pohtical upheaval.  At the same time, the regime has developed an intelligent ideological machinery  that has been brain-washing the ChUean  population for 15 years. Pinochet has not  only played with the "fear factor" but has  also utUized the most effective mass media  communicator: television. It is not surprising, then, that Pinochet would want to govern by consensus instead of by imposition.  But, is this feasible? Could the "yes" possibly win?  ternational corporations, big land-owners  bankers, etc.? And ... will the dictator actuaUy leave?  In the last few weeks the people of ChUe  have taken to the streets to say "no" to the  dictatorship. In a couple of weeks they wU  say "no" again, by voting in a plebiscite  weU-staged by that very same dictatorship  They wUl say "no" on October 5 and wU  continue to say "no" in the many ways they  have invented in the last 15 years. But then  ... what?  KINESIS LIFE STORIES  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXNXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^  by Nora D. Randall  Coupon-clipping your way  to heaven (and prosperity)  You never know when you're going to  have a revelation.  It could happen any time, under the most  bizarre or the most mundane circumstances.  Take, for example, my latest revelation. I  got a coupon book through my maU slot the  other day and, looking through it, I realized  why the Socreds continue to have so many  supporters.  It was there. You might say it was written  in invisible ink under the receipt for stir-fry  cucumber. It leapt out at me, it embraced  me, we danced around the room. Oh boy,  I thought, this is it, no more isolation, no  more feehngs of being ineffective.  Right there in the front of the coupon  book was a letter from the premier of the  province offering me a chance to contribute  to the future prosperity of the economy in  British Columbia. The truth is, I am dying to contribute. And what the Socreds do  that's so successful, so simple, so brilliant,  is they make it easy for you to contribute.  Frankly, the problem with the left, ah  of it—the women's movement, the unions,  even the NDP—is that it's just too hard.  They've aU got things that need to be done  that are nearly impossible to do.  For example, the farmworkers. The Canadian Farmworkers Union has been working  for eight years to get agriculture covered  by Occupational Health and Safety Regu  lations. It's a simple thing, most industries  have it. It just means there is government  regulation of safety conditions in the work  place.  It seems hke a totally reasonable thing  to want in a work place where poisonous  chemicals are routinely used on the food we  eat. The union has written briefs, gone to  meetings, demonstrated, talked to the me-  next year—I imagine a Socred grower or  maybe a bunch of them phoned up their Socred MLA's and said, "Hey, we don't want  this to happen."  And I bet the MLA's said, "No problem,  we'll take care of it." Then they just announced the regulations wouldn't be covering agriculture after aU—and they don't to  this day. Now, isn't that easy?

Lots of people have worked on this and  what have they managed? Nothing. This is  too hard, too discouraging.  My guess is the Socreds have made it  much easier for their people. In fact, I  imagine what happened in 1983—when the  Worker's Compensation Board announced  it was going to cover agriculture starting  (any variety)  Look at the White Spot strikers. I was on  their picket Une the other day and they were  working hard. People were on the picket hne  wearing signs, singing songs, talking to people. There was even a man who'd made a  big puppet of Peter Toigo (White Spot's  owner). He gathered aU the workers around  and told them what a big man he was, a  friend of the premier's, even.  No-Zero-Zip  I talked to one of the waitresses. She said  White Spot wanted to cut her hours back  from 35 to 25, and she couldn't afford to  hve on that. EspeciaUy since White Spot  was offering her no-zero-zip increase in the  first year, 10 cents/hr in the second and 10  cents/hr in the third for a grand total of a  20 cent increase over three years.  This from a guy who was wilUng to pay  $500 million for the Expo lands.  Here's this woman out on this Une, she's  worried, she's nervous and she's working her  buns off. The management team, they don't  bother working hke that. They just walked  into negotiations, put their one-and-only offer on the table, said it was their final offer  and walked out.  Then leaflets started appearing in the  restaurants from the company's negotiating committee saying the "union wUl have  caUed a strike without wages and benefits  even being discussed ... "We don't know  for sure that all the guys on this negotiating  committee are Socreds, but we know Toigo  is. And I bet they are, 'cause things are easy  for them.

The answer is a 25 cent coupon on any variety of Wonder Bread.  There were other coupons as weU, but  this is the one that captured my heart and  mind. He promised me that by using this  coupon I could "contribute to an even more  vital, prosperous economy in our province"  and "have the satisfaction of knowing you  are providing jobs for those in our province  who work on farms, in manufacturing and  processing plants, and in the packaging industry."

This was a slogan  trumpeted 30 years ago in the southern  United States to ensure that integration between Blacks and whites would not occur  and that equahty between the races would  not take place.  Two women have recently chaUenged this  "Separate But Equal" phUosophy on behalf  of women. Margaret Tomen, an elementary  school principal, has chaUenged in court the  bylaw which forces male and female elementary school teachers in Ontario to belong to  different unions. She feels such separation is  not needed today, the way it may have been  in the past. If aU elementary school teachers  belonged to a single union, it would presumably have more power when dealing with the  province's school boards.  In a paraUel case, a young teenage hockey  player, Justine Blainey, has successfuUy petitioned the Ontario Human Rights Commission for the right to play ice hockey  on a boys' team, since no girls' team offers her the same high level of competition. Girls in Ontario have their own hockey  leagues entirely separate from those of the  boys, but compared to the boys' teams, the  few girls' teams have httle encouragement,  much less funding, and worse practice and  game times.  Can one blame Blainey for wanting the  equahty that can apparently only come  from some amalgamation of the two groups?  As things are now, there is httle to challenge her on the girls' teams, whereas she  could become a far better hockey player if  she could train and play with the boys. Separate is certainly not equal.  So far it would seem- that two separate  but paraUel groups, in the examples above,  would benefit members if they joined to  form one entity. We don't yet know if these  groups themselves would also benefit, but  we can consider what has happened in the  past to groups which have joined together  for a better future.  One such example is the amalgamation in  1969 of the Macdonald Institute in Guelph,  Ontario with the University of Guelph. In  1948, when this Institute became a college, it catered to women's concerns, with  departments- of Foods and Nutrition; Tex-  tUes, Clothing and Design; and Home Management. The principal was a woman, the  faculty were women and the students were  Run By Men  After amalgamation, the thrust of the institute changed somewhat with the three  new departmental components focusing on  hotel and food administration, the famUy  and the consumer. These entities conjure  up visions of management, sociology and  economics rather than of women's matters,  which is perhaps what was intended because  soon more and more men were being hired  and promoted whUe some women lost their  jobs.  At present, the dean of what was once  Macdonald Institute is a man, the heads of  the three departments are men, and nearly  half the teachers are men too. The student  body remains almost entirely women.  they do, that faculty members make sexist comments, and that women are omitted  from academic course content. UNCG may  claim that women and men are now equal on  its "up-graded" campus, but women were  much better off when UNCG was for women  only.  Drastic Effect  Sports groups have also been mesmerized  by the concepts of efficiency and progress.  In an effort to streamline their organizations, women interuniversity athletic groups  Examples  show  that  women's groups function  well   on   their   own,  envisioning their own  future   and   working  toward that ideal.  Whereas 20 years ago, women ran the institute the way they felt it should be run  and had academic power that was rare for  women, now men are in the positions of  power which makes this college no different  from any other.  This same debasement of women's autonomy and concerns also occurs when  women's colleges become coeducational, as  many have done recently in the United  States. In 1931, when the North Carolina  CoUege for Women became a fuU-fledged  university of the state system, it catered  to women students, with the administration  and teachers almost aU women. In 1963, because of external pressure, it became coeducational as the University of North Carolina  at Greensboro (UNCG).  In the Mowing years, many men teachers were hired and promoted, often in the  guise of "upgrading" the university, and  high administrative positions were created  of which 90 percent went to men. The  student body is now two-thirds female,  but UNCG is run almost entirely by men,  as are aU other coeducational universities.  The student leaders are mostly men, whUe  women, compared to men, receive fewer  grants than loans (which must be repaid),  lower loans, lower earnings for their work,  and less institutional employment.  Women students complain that the men  receive more attention from teachers than  Desktop Publishing  Design, iactoutandcoordination A  o/('your arapkic needs\ li/e  kefy uou produce ad  insertions, irockuree,  farms andaiimanner  in Canada have been joining with those  of men. In 1969, four of the five regional  conferences had separate organizations for  women and men, and 40 universities Usted  a woman as the Women's Athletic Director.  By 1978, four of the five conferences—aU  but Ontario—had become coeducational in  their administrative structure with a drastic  effect on the female organizers: the number  of female Women's Athletic Directors had  dropped from 40 to 19.  Only in Ontario, where the men's and  women's structures remained separate, has  the women's interuniversity sport organization retained a broad base program. And  only in Ontario, where the separate but paraUel administrations remain, do the women  assume association responsibilities and authority on a par with men.  Few people apparently noticed the loss of  women's authority during this ten-year period, because in 1978 the Canadian women's  Interuniversity Athletic Union joined with  the men's national body to become the  Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union  (CIAU). Again, the pattern of women often losing out because of amalgamation was  repeated. Progressively fewer women attended annual meetings of the CIAU to vote  on women's issues, untU in 1985 special legislation had to be passed to help correct the  imbalance between men and women voting  delegates.  Far fewer women compared to men are  now coaching women's university teams,  whUe almost no women coach men's teams.  This is so even though more women than  men study physical education at Canadian  universities.  Is "Separate But Equal" reaUy a bad  slogan as we have been taught to beheve?  The examples from academic institutions  and university athletic groups would seem  to indicate not. They show that women's  groups function weU on their own, envisioning their own future and working toward  that ideal. When such groups give up their  female-identification, however, women soon  lose their authority if these examples are  typical, as they seem to be.  Anecdotal evidence indicates why women  lose out—if there is only one head or one  representative for a group, it seems to many  more "natural" this should be man; if a  woman takes leave from a job to have a  baby, she is often considered not dedicated  to her work; if she changes jobs because of  her husband's relocation, she is unlikely to  be seen as leadership material. Men move  in and up in the new amalgamation, whUe  women too often stay put or move out.  These examples are a warning to women.  Amalgamation of two entities in theory may  seem an ideal way to gain their common  ends with an increase in power. But if either entity has its own additional agenda  (such as keeping women in partial control)  that is also important, and if one entity has  more clout in the larger society (the men's  or mixed group), then women should beware of the future of the combined group.  It won't be separate, but for women it almost certainly won't be equal.  Pamphlets from page 7  hid at a friends' home for three months.  It was only when her lawyer contacted  her husband—inadvertently revealing her  address—that the violence began again. She  and her daughter have Uved at Shirley  Samaroo House since July.  According to shelter worker Isabel Saez,  there is a forty woman waiting hst at this  year-old house. "We only let women jump  ahead of this hst in extreme emergencies.''  Myths concerning battered women are  plentiful, says Clark. A common one is the  'why-do-they-stay?' myth. "First of ah—  why shouldn't they be aUowed to stay? In  any event, one third of aU women already  leave when the abuse begins," she said.  "And if not, they are actively struggling  to leave one way or another, by accessing  money or a place to hve."  She knew of one woman "who had money  but not access to it, so she would buy extra  cans of coffee and then return them, thereby  accumulating the refund money.  George Brown CoUege opened its doors  early September to a pUot course, the  only one of its kind in Canada: Assaulted Women's and ChUdren's Coun-  seUor/Advocate Program. "This program  is grounded in feminist phUosophy which  analyzes those social, cultural, pohtical  and economic conditions which predispose  women and chUdren to become victims of  violence," the course description reads.  According to instructor Sandra Fishleigh,  a course objective is to counter the professionalism of women's services. "We think  professionalism and government control are  happening anyway so we want to do what  we can to fight it, by preparing women  with a feminist background and content  there are concrete skiUs developed over 15  years [in the women's movement].

"Seventy percent of the students are [assault] survivors weU along in their own healing who want to work with other women,"  said Fishleigh. "The other 30 percent have  background volunteering in shelters and a  growing awareness of women's issues."  Fishleigh doubted the course would create a hierarchy between newly certified  counseUors and the women they counsel—  thereby adding to the professionalism.

KINESIS by Duane Burton  In the spring of 1987 Rina Frati-  celh became Studio D's second executive  producer—almost midway through its second decade.  If You Love This Planet, Not A Love  Story: A Film About Pornography, Beyond The Veil, Abortion: Stories from  North and South, I'll Find A Way and  on and on—some 80 plus films within 14  short years. Nowhere else in the world wUl  you find a studio hke the National Film  Board of Canada's Studio D: the women's  unit. The quality and number of films Studio D's produced is incredible; their focus  and perspectives moving, disturbing, compelling.  That Studio D consistently speaks to  people with a voice that comes from outside the dominant culture is a measure of a  particular kind of professional integrity:  We do not set ourselves apart from  our audience as an elite of 'professional  film makers.' We are in continual communication with other women. Our primary identity is that we are women, living in Canada at this time in history.  We put our professional skills to work  towards the goals we share with other  women. This is our interpretation of  professionalism.  Kathleen Shannon, founder of Studio D.  It is sobering to realize that Shannon,  Studio D's founder and executive producer  for 13 years, made such quality films with  so few resources. Consider for a moment  that Studio D has won a third of the NFB's  Academy Awards and its films are used  three to five times more often than any sim-  Uar group of English language films. Yet the  studio has never received more than three  percent of the film board's resources (at the  best of times).  When Shannon stepped aside in 1987,  she left a legacy to be reckoned with, of ,  women speaking out through a powerful media against violent, sexist and racist domination; of breaking new ground in ways  women work with each other; of a commitment to the ongoing development of women  " THE WOMEN'S  u STUDIO OF  THE NATIONAL  " FILM BOARD  -  OF   CANADA  and feminist analysis. Now it is up to Rina  FraticeUi to continue the chaUenge.  Fraticelli is unintentionaUy very late: our  meeting is preempted by a last minute NFB  meeting and another interview. While I wait  I think back to my last night shift at the  battered women's shelter.  There, five women from aU walks of hfe  were gathered in the shelter's hving room  watching a video. The woman on the screen  describes her isolation and years of brutal  victimization at the hands of her husband.  The watching women respond with laughter, and commentary—bitter laughter, intimate and witty commentary. I think to  myself "this is a good one; we need more  such films and videos." I know it's good because these women (five of the best critics  you'U find anywhere) had connected with  each other's pain and isolation watching this  video and had stayed up very late talking  with each other.  Suddenly, I realize why Rina FraticeUi is  important to me. I begin to understand why  I want to interview her and what I want to  know. I want to know her politics and what  kind of experience she has had in working  with women? What criteria wUl she be using to determine exceUence and what films  wUl get made? How wUl she use this position's power? And finaUy, can I simply ask  these questions up front?  You bet I can. FraticeUi is not only open  and direct—she is also very generous with  her time and talk.  Duane: What were the feminist markers in your life?  Rina: For me, hke a lot of women, The  Feminine Mystique was a real marker in  Moving the censor:  the balancing act of women's film  I was continuing with my arts work,  teaching theatre at Concordia and the University of Montreal, and had started a  women's performance group to work out  of Powerhouse GaUery. Working artistically  gave me the chance to remove myself from  one-on-one casework—but in the arts I  was also frustrated that the context wasn't  there.  Duane: Where did that frustration  lead you?  Rina: I moved to Toronto knowing that  I wanted to be involved in feminist activity and knowing that I wanted to work with  women in the arts.  I also had a Uttle time, and so I approached the women in the Fireweed collective to be one of their volunteers (it was  aU volunteers). It was among the most important experiences in my hfe.  Duane: What was so special about  this small feminist literary publication?  Rina: As the Fireweed collective we re-  aUy grappled with how to balance the needs  of a feminist pubhcation with the various  kinds of material we were getting.  How to get material of very good quality and yet how not to privUege those who  were already privUeged? How to say, "Come  in, we are looking to hear your work," and  to suspend our patriarchal-defined values of  artistic qualities so that we could hear the  work?  Duane: Would you call this 'analyzing oppression'?  Rina: Yes. You see the first few steps are  big and easy, and Uberating. And then you  have to deal with: how does discrimination  work when it's hot blatantly "no women  Women were present in inverse  proportion to the money and  status involved in the work  my hfe. When I read it, the penny dropped.  I had just graduated from coUege and was  running a halfway house for teenagers in  Montreal.  At the same time, one particular group of  very strong women started Montreal's first  consciousness raising group. It was hke the  mother of them aU, and I was the beneficiary of a lot of their very crucial organizations.  One in particular was a httle store called  The Flaming Apron. It took anything a  woman made and sold it for her, and I ended  up volunteering there. Then they started a  gaUery called Powerhouse GaUery which is  now one of the leading feminist organizations in Montreal.  Powerhouse GaUery spun off into a  women's performance space. At that point  I was finishing up my Master's degree (in  Enghsh) and involved in running a community clinic called Head and Hands. We were  a staff of about six or seven—aU women,  it just so happened. It was a real model of  women's community organizing. That was a  tremendous politicising experience. We had  the theory and we were trying to figure  out how you apply that to buUding structures that really work. There were a lot of  meetings—coUective meetings.  need apply here?" How do you get at the  roots of that sort of thing?  Two activities reaUy solidified for me how  systemic discrimination works. One was  working on Fireweed where at every collective meeting aU of us read all of the submissions, and we debated and soul-searched  late into the night.  You have a submission here from a  renowned woman artist who is going to  bring credibility to the newspaper, who is  going to validate the struggles of the women  who are reading the magazine. On the other  hand you have something rough, somebody  writing for the first time—and that's Uberating. How do you work with both those  things? How do you frame each of them so  it's clear they both came out of very distinct, very real, very important contexts? Is  there a difference between communication  and artistic creation?. Is content everything?  With any artistic activity that's politically conscious, you're always trying to balance artistry (by which I mean how adept  you are at using the language of your  medium to speak as articulately as possible), and the content about which you are  speaking, and the poUtical analysis that  feeds into the ways in which you approach  that content.  How do you value form without excluding  people who are separate from that formal  language? How are we establishing what's  good? From Aristotle down is gender-based.  How do we step outside of it so we are moving this male censor which we have taken  into ourselves?  Through Fireweed I started to understand a httle bit about systemic discrimination. I was aware of the fact that I simply  wasn't seeing very many plays by women. So  I organized a national women's playwright-  ing competition with Fireweed.  It started me thinking—if women are po-  tentiaUy 52 percent of the creative pool, but  we're only seeing 10 percent of them with  submissions—then where is the block?  Duane: What was the other activity  that solidified for you how systemic discrimination works?  Rina: This was at the time of the  Applebaum Hebert Commission which reevaluated the Canadian Commission on  Culture. Status of Women in Canada commissioned a number of reports from women  in the various artistic fields—and they commissioned a theatre study from me on the  status of women. It was a very important  experience. I looked at every theatre across  Canada which got any funding from the  Canada CouncU, and I looked at the numbers of women.  My grid at the time was whose version of  reality is being propagated in the culture?  It was the issue I had been dealing with  in Fireweed. Whose version of reality was  being put on the stage?  Of about 130 theatres, for a three year  period of time, how many plays by women  had they produced? How many women had  directed them, and how many of the artistic directors were women?  I discovered a rule that worked across the  country: women were present in inverse proportion to the money and status involved in  the work.  The other thing that amazed me and  proved to be a very good lobbying force  later was the realization that, where women  were artistic directors, significantly more  women's plays were selected and women directors hired than in the national average—  and more Canadian content done.  Whose version  of reality  is being  propagated?  So I was able to turn around and say—  aU right, we're paying the boys to do foreign  work, to hire male directors to do plays by  men; and in plays by men there are 70 percent roles for men and in plays by women  there are 50 percent roles for women.  Duane: Were you able to look at the  numbers of women trying to get into  theatre ?  Rina: I looked to theatre schools where  I found women were applying in equal or  greater numbers. Women's educational success rates are just as high or higher, but  they can't get that first job. That was re-  aUy interesting for me because, for years  when people found out I was a feminist, they  would teU me that no discrimination existed  in their particular artistic field.  "I'd love to have a woman working here,"  says the male artistic director. But in fact  there was no money where the rhetoric was.  The boards of directors were aU male and  hired aU male artistic directors. We knew  what we had to do was to get women on  Canada CouncU juries. You've got to go to  the source of the power.  Now we're sophisticated enough to know  that we're not just talking about an issue of  women, but an issue of other.  What single small minority group hogs  the power? Who's making the decisions?  Who decides what reality is, what legitimacy is, what quality is? Who has the authority?  The authority question became very central to me when I started to work with writers as a dramaturge because the amount of  internal censorship women have is tremendous. Their internalized male voice of authority is always judging them to be inadequate. There's a tremendous amount of psychological undoing and redoing that has to  be done.  Duane: What did you do with this  new understanding?  Rina: The theatre commission was great  for me. I felt much less vulnerable. It didn't  give me aU the answers as to "how" systemic  discrimination works, but I certainly knew  "why" I could look at a situation where  there were no overt signs and see how discrimination can he very clearly in so-caUed  equal circles. What is equal about a situation where a room is fiUed with men, and a  few women in subordinate positions?  Art has no gender, but juries have gender, artistic directors have gender, boards  of directors have gender, and you can certainly insure that the people making the decisions represent the community you teU me  they are representing.  Twenty years ago we had to fight a  battle—an artistic battle—to argue that  Canadians were the people who should  determine Canadian culture. The Canada  CouncU would never be expected or permitted to fund any film, theatre or hterary  project produced entirely by foreigners. You  know that it's got to be a majority, at the  very least, of Canadians.  I'm saying Canadians are not aU male  and so if we're going to be putting in our  tax dollars, it has got to reflect the reality  of women as weU. That's exactly the struggle that feminism is going through now in  terms of our 'racial' inequality.  We have to be responsible for the fact  that aU women are not white and not aU  women are from western European origin.  We simply have to grapple with our limited  resources. How are we going to become accountable?  Duane: Is that something you can address using film, and as the executive  producer of Studio D?  Rina: The position I have the privUege  of representing at the moment is one that is  very important and very vulnerable. We're  so desperately under-financed. With any  artistic activity that's pohticaUy conscious,  one is always trying to balance artistry and  the poUtical understanding that feeds into  the ways in which you approach content.  We have a struggle to balance aU of those  things to get the women involved in those issues to speak on their own behalf, and bring  to them the most subtle, sophisticated, articulate film language we can so we can  speak to as many women as possible and as  eloquently as possible. To balance the need  of generating strong content with the need  of generating strong film makers.  Duane: Can you give me an example?  Rina: The Studio D film To A Safer  Place (a film on incest) for me reflects very  weU how you need to balance real filmmaking skUls and decisions, with the issue  that must be addressed. I don't think this  film could have been made the way it was  anywhere but at NFB Studio D.  You know, among the first things you do  when you start with a documentary film is  you get people to sign consent forms giving  you permission—in advance—to use their  presence. WeU, with this film we didn't, and  I don't think this film could have been made  on any other basis. We said to Shirley, "At  any stage you can say, 'I don't hke this,' or  'I can't five with this' and we'U say okay and  destroy the originals." It was a real collaborative effort.  Duane: What is your hope for Studio  D?  Rina: To bridge the isolation and share  power with women.  I think now that Kathleen Shannon's  unmatchable legacy—Studio D—is in good  hands.  PMS  Women-talking-to-women  strength of this film  by Suzanne Fournier  In a packed movie theatre in downtown  Vancouver, women discuss with intensity a  set of medical symptoms fully 80 percent  of women experience on a regular basis. It  is the premiere of a film on premenstrual  changes and it draws women from every  walk of hfe, some with their male partners.  Yet the event, and the good, honest documentary film that has sparked the discussion are largely ignored by the mainstream  media. Even though PMS has come out of  the closet and is being sold in magazines  and medical journals as a hot new medical condition, it's stiU an issue that mainly  women are deeply concerned about. And  this film's approach to coping with the condition chiefly through self-help and intel-  Ugent research Ukely doesn't sit weU with  those who want to exploit the more sensational aspects of PMS as an excuse for murder, or a disabling condition that should  be treated with profitable mood-altering  drugs.  What People Are Calling PMS is  the name of the 28-minute documentary  film by Vancouver film maker Haida Paul,  the latest in a series of exceUent films  on women's health issues produced by the  National Film Board. Its Vancouver premiere on Sept. 8 was co-sponsored by the  Vancouver Women's Health CoUective. The  Health CoUective also played a central role  in facilitating the discussion by a women's  self-help group that forms the centerpiece of  the film.  CoUective member Anne Fraser leads the  group's discussion in the film in a skUlful,  warm and understated way. Paul acknowledges the group of women in the film "had  never met and were brought together for  American Cousin. The NFB's Jennifer  Torrance, producer of the film, acknowl  edges the board's recent series of film on  women's health (and other) issues has been  achieved in remarkably consistent fashion  "by and for women."  Torrance points out the film wasn't a  creature of the Montreal-based NFB Studio D. It was produced out of the NFB's  Vancouver office, Pacific Centre, and that's  as it should be, says Torrance. "Every NFB  outlet across the country, in each province,  should be producing films that address  women's issues."  Paul acknowledges she had to handle  carefully the double-edged sword that is  premenstrual syndrome. Her goal was to  vaUdate the set of physiological and psychological changes most women experience  just before the onset of menstruation—and  to discuss the experience of the approximately 40 percent of women with accentuated symptoms such as breast tenderness,  mood swings, bloating and a craving for  sugar.  Paul also wanted to touch on the experience of women whose symptoms are so extreme their abUity to cope is severely tested.  In the film, Fraser raises with the support  group her concern that PMS wUl become  an official medical diagnosis such as those  adopted by the American Medical Association. Fraser points out that the "psychia-  trization" of PMS could affect the ability of  this film" but once they were introduced,  the discussion about PMS "flowed spontaneously."

Symptoms include low abdominal pain  which can spread into the thighs, anus and  lower back; low grade or high fever with  flu-like symptoms, abdominal bloating and  sensitivity to touch, increased menstrual  pain, vaginal discharge with unpleasant  odour, pain on intercourse, irregular bleeding, painful urination and painful bowel  movements. The pelvic exam can be quite  painful, especiaUy if the cervix is touched.  PID is a serious disease and is considered  to be the most frequent cause of infertUity  in women. About 15 percent of women have  decreased fertility after a single episode of  PH).  PH) occurs predominantly in women under 25 years. It rarely occurs before the first  menses, after menopause or during pregnancy. It is most often the result of infection  from sexuaUy transmitted diseases such as  chlamydia or gonorrhea, but it can also be  caused by birth complications, septic abortion or IUD use.  iCjausesi  1 U LU UU '  Treating P.I.D.  by Heather Herington N.D.  Infection usuaUy begins in the vagina,  then spreads upward to the uterus and the  faUopian tubes. Most often both tubes are  affected although symptoms may predominate on one side. The tubal infection with  its pus-like secretions may lead to obstruction of the tubes and create an abscess  in the tubes and/or ovaries, although the  whole pelvic cavity can be affected.  The danger of a ruptured tube and the  subsequent spread of infection can lead to  the possibUity of sterUity because of the formation of adhesions and extensive scar tissue.  PID is a good example of a disease where  naturopathic medicine and conventional  treatment work weU together. The goal of  naturopathic medicine is to support the immune system and promote drainage in the  pelvic area whUe conventional medicine offers antibiotics if the offending bacteria is  gonorrhea or chlamydia—both difficult to  treat naturaUy. Also, to determine the extent of infection, a laparoscopy can be performed which will aUow a look at the pelvic  cavity.  Chiropractic or naturopathic manipulation and acupuncture wUl help reheve congestion and pain in the pelvic area. Castor  oU packs with heat can be put over the ab  domen or back. Hot Sitz baths are comforting and relaxing.  Hot foot baths may assist the body in  fighting infection. Here's how: wrap the  woman in blankets to keep her body warm.  Have a container of ice water and washcloth  for cool applications to keep her head cool.  After she puts her feet in the water, keep  the water as hot as can be tolerated for 20-  30 minutes. At the completion of the treatment, lift her feet out of the hot water and  pour over them the cold water used for the  head compresses. Dry her feet thoroughly.  Rest in bed untU sweating stops.  Another method is using a hot foot bath  whUe placing ice packs to the lower abdomen every four hours for 30 minutes fol  lowed by 30 minutes of bed rest. This can  increase the rate of healing, often dramatically.  PID can become chronic if initial therapy was inadequate or begun too late. Some  women with chronic PID have constant  pain whUe others have a periodic recurrence of their symptoms, usuaUy when run  down. For this reason, it's very important  to stay away from junk food, to get plenty  of rest and exercise and to support the immune system through nutrition, botanical  medicine and hydrotherapy. Eliminate the  intake of coffee, black tea, sweets, alcohol  and tobacco. Visuahzation and stress reduction techniques can decrease the frequency  and severity of recurrence.  In chronic PH), naturopathic physicians  use the vaginal depletion pack. These are  herbal drawing packs that help establish  drainage from the infected area.  Reinfection is a common complication of  PH), thus making the identification and  treatment of possibly infected sexual partners mandatory for effective treatment. Abstinence is recommended untU treatment  is complete. It is possible, especiaUy in  chlamydia infection, for there to be no  symptoms, and recurrence after therapy is  common. Careful lab monitoring is important to ensure eradication of the infection.  Another angle on PH) is that pelvic congestion is the holding of emotional pain.  The book Healing into Life and Death  by Stephen and Ondrea Levine has an excellent visualization on "Healing the Heart  of the Womb."  As in any disease, it's important to look  at the cause from many angles. With acute  PH), chlamydia or gonorrhea—if present-  need to be treated with antibiotics, as the  complications are too serious to use slower  treatments. H you have any of the symptoms hsted above make sure to: 1. Get a  lab test and take appropriate antibiotics, 2.  Support your immune system, and, 3. Be  aware of the emotional connection to your  physical body.  The Canadian PID Society is holding  PID: A One-Day Discussion on Sat.  Nov. 5 at the Thunderbird Community  Centre.

This serious consequence of the "selling"  of PMS is just tantalizingly touched on;  those who have PMS and have done basic  research may find it frustrating not to hear  more discussion. But Paul stresses her film  wUl be reaching communities where women  can barely get their doctors or families to  recognize that PMS exists, let alone treat it  itively with recommended diet changes,  vitamins and counselling, instead of mood-  altering drugs and progesterone.  The use of physicians JerUynn Prior and  Diane Rothon to give a lot of information  itraight from the shoulder is a handy tool,  but it's also intrusive. Both seem to have  been garbed by Central Casting in neat  blouses with bow ties at the front that suggest sympathetic authority. Dr. Prior's admission that her own experience of PMS was  made more difficult to cope with during a  period of stressful separation and divorce is  a nice touch, and both women are engaging  speakers. The two doctors, however, stand  out as a "talking heads" format that interrupts the easy flow of the film. Their use as  authority figures is curious in a film based  on a self-help women's support group.  That returns us to the real strength of  the film: It's women talking to women, giving each other—and us—immense support  and comfort as they do so. Listen to what  they say:  "I would go through anxiety attacks ...  I went to my doctor and at first he tried giving me Valium. It just made me feel worse  and I ended up going back into his office  nearly hysterical. He said 'I think you need  to go to the hospital and have a couple of  days rest.' I went to the hospital and got  checked in and the next thing I knew I was  on the psychiatric ward! I'm not crazy!"  "I'm tired of [people] using my PMS as  a crutch when I want to talk about what's  reaUy bugging me."  Sensitive To Criticisms  Paul has had to answer criticism the film  ignored women whose coping mechanisms,  however enlightened, are seriously challenged by severe PMS. Said one audience  member at the premiere: "If I just had to  cope with a httle bloating or craving chocolate, I'd be grateful. That's not PMS to  who feel they are incapacitated, Paul hopes  the film wUl give them tools to take with  them when they seek medical help.  But in the final analysis, it's perhaps left  again to the real women speaking about  themselves to educate us about PMS. The  support group in the film is a nice cross-  section of women of varying age, race and  TIRED OF BEING TIRED?  Yeast overgrowth may be the  culprit. And Candida Albicans  is its name.

V5H 4J8  Director Haida Paul  Another woman suggested to Paul that  in attempting to appeal to a mainstream  audience with an "upbeat" message about  PMS, the film had sacrificed or trivialized  the truly disabling effects of PMS.  Paul is sensitive to those criticisms. "I  wasn't saying to women if they just shape  up and eat their greens they'll be aU right,"  said Paul. "On the other hand, I don't want  to see PMS used as a term for any woman  who makes some kind of emotional gesture  in the world, to have her dismissed as un-  reUable." Paul also notes that perhaps film  can't address the fuU range of symptoms  individual women experience and for those  Would women watching the empowering  support group in the film know how to set  up their own? Or how to get in touch with  the Vancouver Women's Health CoUective  or its resources? Paul concedes they might  not. But whether it's copying down the collective's phone number or putting up a notice on a community buUetin board that  helps a woman break out of her own isolation and seek support, this film makes clear  that's a step that has to be taken.

It would be a history of the  contemporary women's movement written  by socialist feminists in Toronto. I thought  then, ah, another book which wUl pretend  Ontario is Canada and socialist feminism is  "correct" feminism.  After reading the book, it turns out my  first assumption was largely borne out, and  my second was—sorry to say—also weU-  founded.  At $19.95, this book is less expensive  than many books of its kind, but stiU costly.  Libraries wUl get copies. The extensive bibliography and footnotes wUl be a boon to  those seeking more, and this book has an  index, enabhng the reader who Ukes to read  around in a book to do so and easing the  task of the researcher.  Fifteen documents from the Canadian  Women's Movement Archives (CWMA)  have been included, providing further examples of the poUtical points raised and critiqued in the text, as weU as offering some  of the flavour of writing from the women's  movement in the last two decades. The  "Selective Chronology, 1867-1988" wUl be  very useful to the reader unfamUiar with  the progress of the women's movement in  Canada, from the demand for suffrage to  the removal of abortion from the Criminal  Code.  After denning their terms (with the notable exception of "class") the authors set  out to answer the central question of the  book, "How do feminists work to change  the society we hve in?" They begin with  the context, an account of the history of  There are [no]  examples from the  Maritimes...  the Canadian women's movement, describing both its institutionalized and grassroots bases.  Here's where my first assumption was  proved: with a heavy reliance on the  CWMA in Toronto, this history is Umited to  examples form Ontario and other organizations whose papers are in the CWMA. As a  consequence, there are only a few examples  from outside Ontario, e.g., Women Against  the Budget, Bread and Roses (from B.C.),  the Saskatoon Women's Liberation Group,  and none from the Maritimes, Alberta or  Manitoba. And, as the authors themselves  point out, this book is about the anglophone Canadian women's movement. The  authors are present in this history, labeUed  as Voice 1, 2, and 3. Although Voice 1 had  hved in Montreal, and was involved with the  women's movement there, only this chapter  mentions Quebec.  THE CONTEMPORARY  WOMEN'S MOVEMENT  IN CANADA  NANCY ADAMSON  LINDA BRISKIN  MARGARET McPHAIL  Good true-life adventure,  but politically oblivious  by Nym Hughes  GOING OUT OF OUR MINDS:  The Metaphysics of Liberation  by Sonia Johnson  Freedom, CA: Crossing Press, 1987  $10.95  Both Sonia Johnson and her book Going Out Of Our Minds are enjoying great  popularity. The book is seUing fast and  Johnson is in demand to lecture to large  audiences at coUeges and universities across  North America. I read the book to try and  find out why.  Johnson is a white, middle-class, ex-  Mormon, American radical feminist. Going Out Of Our Minds is a combination of autobiography and theoretical conclusions about feminism, the oppression of  (all) women and the right way to bring  about a feminist future.  Critical Mass = Planetary Change  Johnson holds a very traditional radical  feminist position: the oppression of women  is the primary oppression and aU other oppressions are sub-sets of gender oppression:  "One of the basic tenets of radical feminism is that any woman in the world has  more in common with any other woman—  regardless of class, race, age, ethnic group,  nationality—than any woman has with any  man."  These are not new ideas. What Johnson contributes that I, at least, hadn't read  before is that the purpose of the women's  She describes fasting,  running for president,  giving speeches  As a true-Ufe adventure story, the book  is fascinating. Johnson describes fighting for  the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in the U.S., including her disagreements with the leadership of the National Organization for Women (NOW) over  the legitimacy of civU disobedience as a  strategy.  She also describes doing civU disobedience, fasting, running for president of the  United States in the '84 election, organizing  women's gatherings and giving speeches.  It's the content of the speeches—the theoretical insights—that are the problem.  movement is to save the planet from destruction.  What wUl save the planet is the end of the  patriarchy. The reason patriarchy continues  to exist is that women collaborate with pa  triarchy. Patriarchy wUl cease to exist when  women stop coUaborating. In order to stop  collaborating women should 1) stop being  afraid and 2) feel, moment-by-moment, how  it (they, we) would feel post-patriarchy.  Not aU women need to do this, just  enough. When an unspecified number of  women are feeling post-patriarchy in-the-  moment, a critical mass wUl be reached and  planetary change wUl occur.  Organizing for the passage of the ERA  seems to have been Johnson's introduction  to and main experience with feminist activism and I guess she was pretty disappointed when the ERA didn't pass.

I like her insistence on  self-healing  However, she thinks the women's health  movement is a good thing and we should aU  learn to do abortions. Contradictions hke  this abound.  The strength of the book lies in Johnson's  * descriptions of tools and techniques she has  used to work with her internalized oppression as a woman. I like her insistence on  self-healing, the importance of women seeing ourselves as courageous and powerful.  She is thorough and befievable in her descriptions of herself as oppressed. Her fatal  flaw is her complete unawareness of herself  as oppressor.  She writes from a place of unexamined  white middle-class American dominance.  She is consistently and, I think, unawarely  racist. For example, she uses the word slavery on virtuaUy every second page, not as  a metaphor, but as a literal description  of "all" women's fives. She identifies Black  Please see Oblivious page 18  As for the omissions, here's just one example: the B.C. Federation of Women is not  mentioned. BCFW was one of the longer  lasting coahtions of women's groups in the  country, but its history is not weU known.  This absence, and that of other B.C. groups,  points out how Uttle of our history is written and how much needs to be done.  The most successful sections of this book  are those which deal with the pohtics and  practices of making change, or not. Using "disengagement and mainstreaming: the  two pohtics of feminist practice" as a framework, the authors examine the practice of  the three currents of feminism—hberal (or  institutionalized), radical and socialist—  and evaluate the potential of each for making change.  Disengagement is "that part of feminist practice that speaks our critique of  the existing society, whatever the nature  of that critique may be." Mainstreaming is  "the ... attempts to engage with women  around concrete issues arising directly out  of their personal experience." It is the varying weight given to these two pohtics which  make differences among currents of feminism visible.  A focus on disengagement can lead  to marginalization (invisibUity), and on  mainstreaming to institutionalization (co-  optation). The authors contend "in the context of our model for making change, only  socialist feminism calls for combining the  elements of mainstreaming and disengagement. In fact, the success of its vision depends on successfuUy finking the two."  "The personal is pohtical" and "sisterhood is powerful" are the ideas at the centre of the "ideology of the women's movement." This ideology is examined through  the lens of the pohtics of disengagement and  mainstreaming, and their inherent dangers,  marginalization and institutionalization.  Because the "personal" has become the  individual, and "sisterhood" masks differences of class, race and sexual orientation  among women, and poses an autonomous  women's movement too narrow in its focus, socialist feminists do not subscribe to  the analysis or "strategic orientation" arising from this ideology. While it operated as  a powerful force to begin and sustain the  women's hberation movement and its activists, the ideology of the women's movement is found lacking, specificaUy because  it does not offer "an adequate analysis of  power relations under patriarchal capital-  The organizational structures used in the  women's liberation movement and the issues which arise from them—"leadership,  membership, voting procedures, committee  structure and education of new members"—  are the topic of the second-last chapter.  This section could be required reading for  any group. It might be used at the beginning of organizing, or at the point of questioning already existing structure and practice. It is a useful summary of what we have  learned over the last two decades about how  we can, and cannot, work together to make  change.  The authors contend that, though the  theory of feminist organizational structures  was based on disengagement from traditional forms, the practice often resulted  in feminist organizations being marginalized or made invisible and hence, ineffective at making change. Coalition and alliance buUding are proposed as organizational forms with more potential, because  they are less isolating.  This is a book that should be read, by  anyone who is interested in the Canadian  women's hberation movement. I have one  reservation though. Anyone who has ever  been talked at by a socialist, of any description, may recognize a particular tone in this  writing. What is implied, but not expressed,  is indeed that socialist feminists who agree  with Adamson, Briskin and McPhaU are the  only members of the feminist branch of the  Correct Line Holding Company.

Tall, pagoda-Uke architectural structures  echoing natural and fabricated forms loom  almost to the gallery ceiling.  Persimmon Blackbridge's "Solitary" and  Lylian Klimek's "Atvan" are just two images from the rich display of women's art  presented in the Gallerie Annual, published this summer. An inviting, soft-bound  book, Gallerie presents the work of 45  women artists in hundreds of photographs,  along with a description of their work or  phUosophy—or both—written by the artists  themselves.  The book explores the visual images  which are immensely varied and represent  almost aU art forms: drawing, painting,  sculpture, photography, film, installation, U-  lustration, etching and so on.  There are direct expressions of the oppression of women, as in Persimmon Black-  bridge's jail series, as weU as insights into  the complexities inherent in developing an-  awareness of self. In Anne Bolivar's dynamic  sculpture "Confrontation," female and androgynous forms move around and interact  with a waU representing the emotional conflict in confronting sexuality as a lesbian.  Symbolic representations of injustice are  found in, for example, Sue Coe's narrative  Ulustrations of the life of a pig, bred for  food. Though the images remain focused  on the animals, there is always a haunting resemblance to the human condition.  Lylian Klimek's huge sculptures in wood relate more to the physical world and have, in  her words, "multiple meanings and associations."  Turning the pages, absorbing image after image, we are inevitably drawn into the  artists' written accompaniments. It is enlightening and enjoyable to be brought close  to these women, to understand what motivates them to create art and to get glimpses  of their personal hves.

The book came out of a trip the two women  took to Australia in 1986.  "We were invited to do f •*:« 12 lectures  and readings throughout the country," explained Warland. "We needed to go from  Sydney to Perth and were anxious to see  the land. We had heard about how wonderful the desert was and love trains. So we decide to travel across Australia by train."  Countless vivid impressions from the  3961 km journey are the heart of Double  Negative.

I find it quite  exciting that there's this female movement  into the desert saying, 'this is mine too and  i relate to it in a different way'."  The book was a completely coUabora-  tive effort. "We bought a special journal for  the trip," Warland explained. "One person  would write and then hand it over, the other  would read what the first had written and  then write her own material in response.  The whole first section of the book—the poetry section—was written that way on the  train. We edited the poems on our return  to Canada and decided to write the third—  prose—section." The prose pieces, whose titles are taken from the poems, reconsider  and interpret the images and experiences of  the journey further.

Describing the end of their journey, Marlatt and Warland write:  and now  you unzip unfold hang up  in a room three times as large  and suddenly we feel cramped  in someone else's house.  Which brings me to this book's most  wonderful quality: its eroticism. By this I  mean not only sexiness (there's that, to  be sure!), but the "erotic" Audre Lorde  has written about: sensory, sensuous feelings ... the connectedness of hving things  with the power of hfe in each of us. Double Negative evokes this erotic power: each  woman attuning to the other, both absorbing impressions of the landscape and people  they encounter. Their journey is romantic  and self-absorbed but also—in the tradition  of fine travel writing—neither "exotic" nor  exploitative but respectful and appreciative  of new experiences.  Daphne Marlatt and Betsy Warland  will read from Double Negative at its  Vancouver launch: Thursday, October  20 at Octopus Books, 1146 Commercial Drive. The launching party will be  from 7:30 pm to 10; the reading will  be from 8:30 to 9. The book, illustrated  with striking negative collages by Cheryl  Sourkes, looks great: don't miss it in  print or in person!  J<INESIS Arts  /////////////////////^^^^^  Miriam Makeba  A woman of hope, determination and song  by Maura Volante  Thirty years ago, Miriam Makeba  brought the sound of South Africa to North  American audiences, singing her infectious  Xhosa and Zulu songs with a wonderfully  elastic and expressive voice. Now, at 52,  "Mama Africa" as she has been called by  fans—is back in North America, with a  voice as wide-ranging and powerful as ever,  carrying with it an extra measure of authority and wisdom.  Her show with Hugh Masakela (composer, flugelhorn/cornetist and ex-husband)  at Vancouver's Orpheum in September was  a nonstop buUdup of energy, musically and  emotionally. It contained far more overtly  pohtical work than she did in the early days  with Belafonte, reflecting the escalation of  the struggle in South Africa, homeland to  both these exiles.  While the eight-piece international band  was onstage virtually the whole two-and-  a-half hours, Makeba and her backup  vocalists—Felicia Marion, Thoko Mdlozi  and SteUa Zulu, aU from South Africa—  came and left three times, wearing three  strikingly different sets of clothing which  dovetaUed with the music they were doing.  In the first set, Makeba did a medley of her  old hits such as "Malaika," "Click Song"  (an American term for the title of a Xhosa  song which is unpronounceable in EngUsh)  and her 1967 hit, "Phata Phata." These are  aU bouncy and swinging, good examples of  the Afro-Pop that has been undergoing a  massive revival in North America. The next  song, "Meet Me At the River," was a lyrical love song in Enghsh, showing off her  soprano-to-tenor range.  With "La Lutta Continua," a celebration of Mozambican independence written  by her daughter Bongi, Makeba introduced  the more pohtical material in the show.  Her next set was aU traditional songs  from her recent album Sangoma, the first  released in North America in a long time.  In her introduction to this section, she said,  "A sangoma is a traditional healer, or what  has been called a witch doctor. But I faU to  see how the words witch and doctor can be  used in the same sentence."  Though some of us would put more faith  in a witch as a healer than a doctor, most  people using the term 'witch' see it as a  derogatory word. In bringing to western audiences these songs from the African healing tradition, she is adding to the power of  that tradition, for no one could hear these  haunting melodies, sung in rich harmony  with sparse rhythmic accompaniment, without feehng their magic.  She is also paying tribute to her mother,  who was a sangoma (she died in 1960), using herbs and trance work to heal her community of physical and mental ailments.  This part of the show was impressive, vi-  suaUy as weU as musicaUy. The four women  wore colourful print wrapped dresses and  headscarves, dancing barefoot to the complex rhythms which showed the roots of the  jazzy modern compositions.  The final part of the evening was the  most hard-hitting, politicaUy. Songs of the  conscript labour trains, the Mandelas and  the chUdren of Soweto were presented in  lush, fuU arrangements, at times a httle  syrupy but full of energy and emotionaUy  very powerful. The words spoke of a desperate situation, but the tone was one of  hope and determination, something Makeba  chngs to despite a hfe fuU of setbacks to herself and her people in South Africa.  In Exiles  Miriam ZenzUe Makeba spent most of the  first six months of her Ufe in jaU with  her mother who was imprisoned for making  homebrew. So she got an early taste of the  repressive regime which was later to deny  her re-entry when she wanted to return from  the United States to her mother's funeral.  Exiled from her homeland, she settled in  the States and continued a thriving singing  career, untU she married Black Panther  Stokely Carmichael in 1968. At this point  she experienced the subtle but equaUy effective American-style repression. Concerts  were canceUed, recording contracts disappeared and, though no official action was  taken, it became impossible for her to work  in the U.S.  So, if you were wondering why you hadn't  heard about Miriam Makeba since the 60's,  the reason is that she has been elsewhere.  Not, as some have assumed, that she has  retired from public fife.  "I have been working!" she said in a recent Seattle interview. "Americans tend to  think America is the whole world, but it's  just one Uttle part of the world. I mean, I've  been singing all these years since I left, but  because people didn't see me on their television, they figure my career is over."  In fact, she has been working the African,  European and Asian concert circuit, trav-  eUing from her  home in  Guinea,  West  Africa As weU, she has been an eloquent  spokeswoman for her people in many poUtical contexts, including the United Nations,  when she served as delegate from Guinea in  75 and '76.  In her personal Ufe she has had turbulent years, too. She has survived five marriages, aU of them now over. "You go into a  marriage thinking this is it, but if it doesn't  work, I don't think I should make anybody's  chUd miserable, and vice versa, I don't think  anybody else's chUd should make me miserable. Hit doesn't work, we get together and  talk about it, we resolve it and we remain  friends."  She has also survived a bout of cancer,  now also in the past. But perhaps her worst  misfortune was the death in 1985 of her only  daughter, during the birth of a stiUbom  chUd. She now looks after her two teenaged  grandchUdren, who are both in school in  Washington, D.C.  Makeba's recent breakthrough into the  American scene again came as a result of  her participation in Paul Simon's Graceland  tour, though as Hugh Masakela pointed  out, "It is Miriam that gave credibility  to him, not the other way around." This  tour also connected her with Warner Brothers recording company. Hence, Sangoma  which was released this year to critical acclaim, though you would be advised to pick  it up quickly, as the company has already  dropped the album and the option to produce another with Makeba  With the success of the current tour,  however, I can't imagine she'U be without a North American contract for long.  She's been selling out aU along the tour,  reacquainting herself with her old fans and  establishing a new audience among those  whose parents remember her.  And whUe many of her fans have only  been aware of the situation in South Africa  for a few years, Miriam Makeba is continuing a campaign of political education she  began over 30 years ago.  "I know my songs wUl never free my  country and change apartheid." she said.  "But what they do is raise the consciousness of those who want their consciousness  raised to the problems of my country. I do  have hope, determination and song. If I ever  lost hope, I think I'd die."  Quebecoise singer inspiring  by Sheila E. Morrison  LUCIE BLUE TREMBLAY  Olivia Records, 1986  Lucie Blue Tremblay possesses a voice  which caresses her hsteners with warmth,  like the fingers of a lover massaging away  your pain and worries.  OriginaUy from Quebec, Tremblay has  traveUed to venues in Canada and the  United States, performing either as an  opening act for a "big name" in women's  music, or as the main attraction. For her  debut, a band of Quebecois musicians and  some notable feminist vocal chords lend  their talents. On one face of the album,  recorded five in San Francisco, Tremblay  graciously thanks the audience for their "receptivity to (her) culture." The response is  a sweU of women's whoops and whistles.  At times Tremblay tends to be too "at  peace with herself." One can almost taste  the tofu and feel the Birkenstocks flopping  on your feet when she addresses her audience in a nasal "spirituaUy-empowered-like-  you-know" voice.  Half the album is en francais, the other  half in English. Tremblay is at ease singing  in both languages, but naturaUy she shines  brightest in French. "Laissez-moi sortir,"  about women in prison, is given its pensive  quality as much by Pierre Niquette's guitar  playing as by Tremblay's lyrics. She beckons  us to realize that "it's hard being inside and  so hard coming out... may our prison conditions change wherever we are." For "St.  Jean Port Jolie," Tremblay plays the tin  whistle and the audience, Cris WUliamson,  Diedre McCaUa, Teresa TruU et al, join in  singing.  Included is a French version of Ferron's  "Ain't Life A Brook," and "MademoiseUe,"  about romance at a women's music festival.  Walking on the land with my red  arm-band  Smiling till my cheeks got so sore  I was alone till you held my hand  Don't wanna go home no more.  "Voix d'enfant" uncovers the hotbed  topic of incest. "So Lucky," previously re  leased as a single on the Demies-Soeurs label, is a love song which speaks of sharing  and commitment in relationships; sentimental but empowering.  So lovely  And I can teU just by your smUe  And in your eyes  That keep my heart so warm,  Like you do hke you do  I'm rising in love with you.  Tremblay's greatest strength as an artist  is her songwriting. A lyric sheet is included;  for every French song EngUsh lyrics are  given. Tremblay utilizes her bUinguahsm to  move freely in and out of the constraints of  a sole language.  Tremblay exudes a wise sensuality—a  precious match; she is an inspiration to  women.  Lucie Blue Tremblay and Faith Nolan  will appear in concert at the Vancouver  East Cultural Centre, Nov. IS. Tickets  $10.

This is the last volunteer's meeting before the event. Twenty-five women are  present. First on the agenda: Are we in a  position to go ahead with the festival?  We are clearly behind schedule and this  festival runs the risk of sloppy production.  Ad hoc coordinator Carol Street strongly  suggests this event be postponed, then re-  announced when it has been better organized. Nadine Davenport and Vicky Gibson have hned up performers and publicized  the event. However, the main organizational  work now was to get together funds and volunteers. A $2000 start-up demand loan was  arranged. StiU not enough to carry us into  the event. Where were the women needed  to puU this off?  Nadine proceeded to outUne the tasks  ahead. StiU to secure were: 1) two sound  systems, 2) stage instruments, 3) fencing,  4) transportation, and 5) stages. We needed  at least five coordinators, plus volunteers  to get the equipment on site. By this time,  many of us were on overload. How were we  going to secure the site? Did we have the  crew to put a fence up? If we did stop now  and postpone, what would it mean in terms  of credibihty? What was each woman here  able to contribute?  Did we, as a group, have enough energy  and commitment to carry on? A deficit of  $2100 already existed. The publicity and  Vancouver's Music Festival  by The Festival Coordinators  performer hne-up would ah be lost. Many  women were already en route. It was not a  long or detaUed discussion, but it was heartfelt and energized and led to the decision to  continue.  Sunday was phenomenal. A team of women,  most of whom had never met before,  bonded, to hve out their dream.  6 am Saturday: the site crew is waiting.  The stage was buUt overnight by an emer-  fundraiser to meet our responsibiUties. A  deficit of $3600 exists. We are working on a  new group structure for next year's women's  music festival. This year's event was not  the best, but we joined together and succeeded. Some of us came up with skiUs we  thought we had lost; others discovered skiU  previously unknown. All of us grew in ways  that were important and empowering to us  aU. The dream of a women's culture was  renewed when a dynamic group of sisters  came together and shared the reality of the  First Vancouver Women's Music Festival.  Thank you to aU volunteer, crew, coordinators and women who extended themselves beyond and into one of the miracles  of 1988. Let's give a great idea a fighting  chance. Please share your feedback and/or  your energy. A questionnaire wUl soon circulate and we invite you to contact us.  VWMF, #1, 1325 Barclay St., Vancouver, B.C.

We are committed to pay aU performers and bUls. Our intent is to organize a  Oblivious from page 15  women as Black, but never identifies women  as white. She makes sweeping generalizations about the universality of women's experiences which deny the hves and analyses  of women of colour.  Messianic Fervour  I was amazed reading this book, published  in 1987, to find absolutely no mention of  the writings of American feminists who are  women of colour, who are Jewish, who are  disabled. There is no mention of the debates  about sexuahty and sexual representation.  Reading Going Out Of Our Minds you  would not know any of these major writings  existed.  Johnson is either completely unaware of  them, which makes one wonder, or she is  completely ignoring them which also makes  one wonder. In fact, this whole book made  me wonder.  So why is Going Out Of Our Minds  so popular? Johnson speaks from a rather  Messianic place and she speaks with a  rather Messianic fervour. Her voice is lyrical, passionate and very seductive. She  paints aUuring word pictures of a world free  from oppression, free from fear, free from  patriarchy. And aU we have to do to get  there is believe.  There's no need to think, or read, or  work, or organize. There's no need to  compromise and mess with complexities.  There's no need to struggle against racism,  or try to equahze economic and educational  privUege or confront anti-Semitism. Johnson's feminism is nice and simple. None of  that matters. We're aU women together and  aU we have to do is believe and we—and  the planet—shall be saved.  Johnson has no experience of oppression  other than gender. Radical feminism and  personal hberation no doubt make sense to  her. For the rest of us, however, her feminism is just another version of white middle-  class America reigning supreme.  Gallerie from page 16  can be found in aU art magazines but, by  asking the women to speak for themselves,  Gallerie presents more directly meaningful  information uncluttered with the complex,  unclear language of "Art."  Women tell stories of how they became  artists; some realised it early in life, others discovered their potential and their skiUs  much later. They tell about their families,  present and past, the importance of feminism as an influence in their work and of  broader influences.  Gallerie has an introduction by editor  Caffyn KeUey who explains her own motivation in creating space for each woman "to  present her art, her story, her own sense of  significance." KeUey's commitment to the  recognition of women's art is underlined in  an amusing, yet eloquent, presentation by  the Guerilla Girls. This group of women  who disguise their identities by wearing gorilla costumes, pubUcise sexism and racism  in the established art world through statistics which document discrimination against  women and artists of colour.  The Gallerie Annual also has essays by  Judy Grahn and Bettina Aptheker which  describe the empowering quality and movement in women's art in the last two  decades. Aptheker speaks of some artists  in particular—Judy Chicago, Mayumi Oda  and Betye Saar—but her words apply to  many of Gallerie's artists. "Each moves to  reclaim a core female imagery, a core female  identity rooted in her ancestral ground,"  says Aptheker. "Each, standing on her own  ground, provides aU of us together, with new  ways of visioning ourselves as women."  Gallerie Annual marks the launching of  a quarterly publication which wUl document  the art of women across North America today.  Gallerie magazine wUl include the work  of nine artists in a similar format to the  annual and wUl be published in September, December and March. (The September issue is now avaUable.) KeUey hopes to  attract guest editors to add new perspectives and perhaps to focus on different areas or media in art. She believes the magazine "wUl be of value to keep the discourse  going," and stresses she stiU needs artists to  submit their work.  Gallerie is distributed across Canada  and the U.S. In Vancouver, it is available through book stores or directly from  Gallerie Publications.

You could  have spent the entire 10 days seeing only  plays written, performed and/or directed by  women. As it was, I started late, but somehow managed to fit 18 performances into  six days, spread over eight of the 11 venues.  These 18 did not by any means cover aU the  productions by or about women. I tried to  focus on those that might have something  special to say about women's hves.  There was so much to choose from: comedies, dramas, revues, one-woman shows,  story-telling, musicals ... There were stories about outstanding women who strove to  succeed in areas closed to women (How She  Played the Game), about women whose  talent and success couldn't save them from  self-destruction (Letters Home, Spend the  Night), about women just getting through  ordinary hves the best way they could (Portrait of a Lady, Female Parts).  There was also a Fringe Forum on "Assessing the Future: Women in the Arts,"  with panelists Nicola  Cavendish, Judith  Marcuse, Shari Ulrich and Barbara Janes, gj  This forum was sponsored by VIEW, the g  performing arts association for women.        £  Overall the quality of the productions °  throughout the festival was high. With such f  a large number to choose from, some to- J  tally unknown and written specifically for  the occasion, one might expect to see as  many misses as hits. Perhaps my choices  were lucky, but most of the productions I  saw were good and in some cases exceUent.  However, none of my favourites made it to  The Pick of the Fringe at the Vancouver  East Cultural Centre.  A few lingering images of women's fives  have stayed with me from the festival:  > laundry, especially ironing seems to be a  universal symbol of domestic bondage. I  saw more ironing in one week than I do  in a whole year.  Talking With  • our great sense of humour: we can use it  to skewer the institutions that try to victimize us and to make hfe seem a little  brighter during, for instance, the dreary  days of PMS.  • we are risk takers: in art and in hfe—  desperate situations call for desperate  measures.  Silver Screen Goes Sapphic  Vancouver's first Lesbian Film Festival will soon grace the screen with an array  of short and feature-length works by women from Canada, Great Britain, the  U.S., Argentina and W. Germany. Highlights of the festival include Sheila  McLaughlin's She Must Be Seeing Things (pictured here), Kamikaze Hearts  ("a raw docu-drama") and two documentaries profiling jazz women of the  40's: International Sweethearts of Rhythm and Tiny and Ruby: Hell Divin'  Women.  Running from Oct. 24—27 at the Vancouver East Cinema, the festival is a  fitting prelude to International Lesbian Week in early November. See Bulletin  Board for details.  The one type of production that seems  hardest to produce and maintain quality in,  is the one-person show. It must be very difficult to be the author, performer and director and not fall into the trap of believing  So much to choose  from: comedies,  revues, musicals...  *+++/+++/+++++*  aU the songs and skits are good and absolutely essential. Revue-type shows need impartial editing. Despite the obvious talent,  these shows were the ones that most often  disappointed.  Here are some highlights of the productions by and about women at the Fringe.  They appear in the order I saw them.  Letters Home Directed by Tessa  Mendel. Sylvia Plath wrote 696 letters to  her family during her short Ufetime. The author, Rose Leiman Goldemberg, has fashioned from these letters an affecting story  of a mother/daughter relationship. Joadie  Newcomb as Sylvia and Nicki St. John as  Aurelia, her mother, were both good, although at times Sylvia's hysteria was at  odds with the seemingly happy tone of some  of her letters. Occasionally Aureha's soft  voice was overpowered by traffic noise. The  grunt gallery where this performance took  place was not sound proof, which was a  problem for aU the productions there.  Female Parts Directed by Michael Bur-  reU. Anna Barry, an accomplished actor,  brought this play from London, England,  to the Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria j  Fringe Festivals. The production consists of *  two completely separate parts related only <*  by their subject being women. The complete *  play has more than the two parts shown ]  here and is to be presented in full at the a  Vancouver Little Theatre this season.  The first act, "Woman Alone," has a  woman locked in her apartment every day  by her husband as he goes off to work, in  punishment for her love affair with a much  younger man. In the apartment, though, she  is surrounded by males—her infant son, her  lecherous brother-in-law, the peeping torn in  the buUding across the street, the obscene  telephone caller. Although she is a sympathetic character (with aU that ironing to  do), I found this act too frantic and too long.  The second act, "Mama Fricchetona,"  was much better. A woman hiding from  the pohce in a church goes to confession  for the first time in 20 years and tells the  story of "how love has betrayed [her]." It's  amusing and touching, ending with her being arrested for "abandonment of the conjugal bed." The play portrays marriage as  complete subjugation for women, forcing a  woman to desperate measures for escape.  Gertrude BeU: the Desert and the  Sown Directed by Belinda Earle. This was  great theatre, one of my "picks of the  Fringe." Pam Howard-Jones portrayed the  intrepid Gertrude Bell who traveUed alone  through Arabia in the early part of this century. She was a woman I would hke to have  met. The production used dance, shdes and  Gertrude Bell herself reading from her diaries and letters to convey the feehng of  those times and places. We experienced the  thrilling sensations of a woman unafraid,  seeking out distant lands and cultures alien  to her. I found myself holding my breath,  hanging on her words. At only 30 minutes,  the show was too short a visit to such an  exotic hfe.  Potatoheads Among Us Coordinated  by Kimelly Anne Warren. This was the best  of the revue-type shows I saw. Not afraid  to deal seriously with hard subjects (wife  abuse and incest), but also showing a deft  touch with comedy, Warren was a treat to  watch. Her anti-war, anti-nuclear message  came across strongly and clearly.  Stay Fresh Special Rags to Rituals Coop. I almost missed this one because the  description in the festival program was so  vague; somebody must have been too afraid  of the M word to print it. It would be  hard to imagine from the dreary depths  of PMS that menstruation could be funny,  but this show was hUarious. It combined  sharp digs at the companies who market so-  called feminine hygiene products ("if [the  product] were dangerous it would be at the  Stay Fresh Third World testing site") with  broad jokes on that wonderful time of the  month we aU love. Allison KeUy and Deborah WUliams caught the mood and atmosphere of a self-help/product promoting  seminar perfectly.  Stay Fresh Special  Laundry and Bourbon Directed by Sue  Lister. Theatre Terrific is a company of disabled actors creating opportunities for actors to appear in roles not normally cast  for the disabled. The director chose James  McLure's play because it was "a one-act  comedy with roles for three strong women  that combines wit with reality." The actors  physical disabihties were totally irrelevant  to the success of the play; only their acting  abilities mattered. The acting was good and  the play was funny.  How She Played the Game Directed  by Garry Davey. Another one of my picks  of the Fringe. Marilyn Norry portrayed six  exceptional women athletes in a series of  weU written profiles by Cynthia L. Cooper.  These women were amazing—so much determination and commitment in their struggles against the prejudices of what women  should and could be. Shdes were used effectively between characters to set the time  period and show us the women themselves.  But it was MarUyn Norry who made the  show. She really became different people,  making us see how each woman dealt with  her own successes and set backs.  Talking With Directed by MicheUe  Allen. The best production I saw; deservedly sold out. This was superb theatre.  Eight vignettes were presented by eight different women. Each vignette was totaUy unrelated to the others and none of the characters portrayed was repeated. Some were hilarious, others dramatic and moving. Some  were bizarre—it's not often we see a hve  snake on stage. But they aU expressed feelings so clearly and cleanly that the audience  could empathize with every character.  KINESIS  Oct. 88 19 <SSSSSS^*KSS*SSK^^  ARTS  /N^o>v\e*  Kassandra's version,  & the mystery of masks  by Melanie Conn  THE BEST OF PAMELA SARGENT  Ed. by Martin Greenberg  Chicago: Academy of Chicago, 1987  $8.95  Pamela Sargent burst into my awareness about 10 years ago when she edited  Women of Wonder, an anthology of SF  stories by women. In addition to introducing some new writers, the book explicitly  acknowledged the existence of a stream of  SF that focused on women's experience as  perceived by women.  There must have been many women as  thriUed as I was with the anthology because  it was soon foUowed by More Women of  Wonder and The New Women of Wonder.  Sargent herself is a prolific short story  writer and noveUst whose most recent book  is The Shore of Women, reviewed in this  column last March. EquaUy at home in both  fantasy and science fiction, Sargent is at her  best when she locates her stories in the not-  too-distant future. In The Best of Pamela  Sargent, "Fears" is a perfect example of her  abihty to present a bleak account of a foreseeable future.  In "Fears," genetic engineering has created a world mainly of men. The few women  are breeders and public mother figures, unable to move freely in public without being  hunted down. The story focuses on a few  chUhng hours in the fife of Joe, a woman  who has ventured out from the refuge she  shares with another woman.  Disguised as a man, Joe had almost completed her errands when she was run off the  road by a couple of joy-riders. The task of  getting her car repaired is fraught with tension as she is forced to spend the afternoon  in the company of men.  Exquisitely conscious of every gesture,  she is fearful of giving herself away with  the wrong cues: when the mechanic names  a price that seems excessive, she wants to  object, but "worried that argument might  only provoke him, then worried stiU more  that I would look odd if I didn't dicker with  him, I settled for frowning ..."  Despite the extreme nature of the almost-  aU-male world, Joe's behaviour is painfuUy  familiar as she carefully manipulates her  way through the hours. As one elderly man  explains, things aren't really so different  from the old days because "men always ...  ...the legendary women's basketball team of the 1920's and '30's.

Now  we don't have to anymore."  The theme of freedom vs. confinement  permeates Sargent's writing. Sometimes, as  in "Fears," there's only a ghmpse of hope  that external conditions wUl change because  of proud and fighting women whose spirits  are stUl strong.  In other stories, the picture is brighter.  "The Mountain Cage" is an unusual perspective on fascism through the eyes of a  cat. Hrurr (the cat) observes the mysterious  comings and goings on a mountainside cave,  soon revealed as Adolph Hitler's bunker.  As Hrurr attempts to make contact with  the Fuhrer's pet dog, hoping to lure her  back to freedom, he learns how seductive  the promise of security can be.  In the very admiring introduction to this  book, Michael Bishop speculates that one  reason Sargent has been unacknowledged by  the various SF annual awards is her reputation as a feminist. These stories reinforce  that reputation, and may supply some of  the credibility she deserves.  The Best of Pamela Sargent is the  third in a series featuring work by outstanding women SF writers, both weU-known  and "unfairly neglected." The first two volumes were The Best of Marian Zimmer  Bradley and The Best of Margaret St.  Clair.  THE FIREBRAND  by Marian Zimmer Bradley  New York: Simon and Shuster, 1987  A few years back, many of us enjoyed  Bradley's Mists of Avalon, a wonderful  re-imagining of the King Arthur legend  from the perspective of Morgan La Fay.  The Firebrand is the story of the Trojan  War, but retold by Kassandra, the future-  seeing sister of Paris whose affair with Helen started the whole conflict.  On one level, The Firebrand foUows the  traditional Greek legend about Troy, complete with the human heroes and immortal  interventions remembered from high school  texts. But despite the vivid descriptions of  place and the exceUent dialogue, Bradley's  attempt to bring the story to Ufe seems  somewhat wooden. Maybe the plot is just  too predictable, even though a few new  twists are supphed.  But the book was saved, at least for this  determined fan, by the steady stream of  conversation between women about their  hves. Every interaction Kassandra has with  women provides more detaU about the hardships of women's hves, about the choices  they make and about their capacity for self-  fulfillment. It's Bradley's special talent to  make her women speak so intimately that  we are wUhng to Mow them on their adventures.  The Firebrand wUl disappoint readers,  though, who expect to be swept away as  they were by the magic of The Mists of  Avalon.  FIREBRAND'  fflioNaiS  A11THQRQPTHEMI5TS0FAVAL0N  A MASK FOR THE GENERAL  by Lisa Goldstein  New York: Bantam Books, 1987  Compared to Bradley and Sargent, Lisa  Goldstein is a newcomer to SF with only  two previously published novels. A Mask  For The General portrays hfe in Berkeley  in the grim world after The CoUapse.  The year is 2021 and the United States  is under mUitary rule; curfews, rations and  identification passes are the controlling factors of everyday life; rehab centres suppress  rebeUious citizens.  The story focuses on a group of students who have created their own culture  of resistance through tribal rituals. Unity is  maintained through drumming and dancing  whUe individuality is symbohzed by wearing  one's animal spirit mask. When The General outlaws masks, a crisis ensues within  the community.  As debates about strategy (direct action  versus "foUowing a different path") rage  through the Berkeley campus, the power of  mask-making is also explored. As one beautiful mask makes its inexorable way through  enemy fines, it becomes clear that if artistic expression is not controlled, "then people can do and say anything they want."  Goldstein is very skUled at moving from  mundane details such as figuring out how to  make a cake with rationed ingredients to the  mysterious practice of mask-making. The  result is a book that feels down-to-earth and  at the same time has considerable depth.  .KINESIS ////////////////^^^^^^  ///////////////////^^^^  Bulletin Board  Read this  AU listings must be received no later than  the 18th of the month preceding pubUca-  tion.

An open letter to the organizers of  "Women in Celebration":  Press Gang Printers is a feminist organization which has provided printing services  and information about printing production  to women's and progressive groups in Vancouver since 1972. Our interest as feminists  is to produce printed materials that reflect  positive change for women and other oppressed groups. In keeping with this goal, it  is our poficy not to print any material which  opposes the advancement of women.  We were pleased to print the "Directory  of Women's Groups" for your organization.  We were also looking forward to participating in the "Women in Celebration" networking day you organized September 10, for  which the directories were produced.  Nothing made us feel less hke celebrating,  however, than to discover when we arrived  that anti-choice groups were participating  in the event, including R.E.A.L. Women,  a prominent anti-feminist organization! We  were further appaUed to discover that you  had added pages to the directories after  they were dehvered to you, one of them for  R.E.A.L. Women.  This event was advertised as a chance for  women's groups to 'network.' Networking  means groups and individuals with common  interests get together to talk and find ways  to work together. This is not possible with a  group whose purpose is to severely restrict  the rights and freedoms of women.  The presence of R.E.A.L. Women was an  insult to every group that has ever struggled for women's rights on any issue.  We feel we were misled about the nature  of the event by not being informed of their  participation. We left because we could not  pretend sisterhood or common cause with  such an organization, nor could we ignore  the significance of their presence.  We are incensed that you added this  group's information page to the Directory  which bears our logo. "Printed by Press  Gang" has, for 16 years, been a symbol of  our pride and support for the work we produce.  We would not have agreed to print information about this group under any circumstances. Since it now appears as if we  had done so, and we feel that this reflects  on our reputation, we ask that you remove  them from the Directory, or replace the  page which bears our logo.  Yours truly,  The Press Gang CoUective  Kinesis:  To the Women's Program, Dept. of the  Secretary of State, Vancouver:  We are writing to voice our strong opposition to the presence of R.E.A.L. Women  and other anti-choice groups at the "Women  in Celebration" day held in Vancouver  on September 10, a networking event for  women's groups, which was funded by your  program. It is our understanding that pressure from your office prevented their exclusion.  The mandate of the Secretary of State  Women's Program is to fund groups working  to advance  the  equality  of women.  R.E.A.L. Women is not a group which advances the cause of women's rights, and it  should not have been present at an event  which purports to be a networking event for  women's rights groups in this province.

Since I am  part of bringing Vito from New York to  Vancouver I want to inform Kinesis readers about The Celluloid Closet which has  been reissued and updated.  OriginaUy published in 1981, Vito toured  with his book then as he is now, and his  book continues to be the landmark study of  how lesbians and gay men are depicted in  film. Being a lesbian feminist, I find Vito's  analysis particularly fascinating.  I happened to see his presentation in Toronto this June and the experience of being in a packed movie theatre on Bloor  Street with hundreds and hundreds of lesbians and gay men was exhUarating. Alternating screenings of "the world's best selection of lesbian and gay film clips" with  thought-provoking commentary, the presen-  HUMAN RIGHTS LECTURE  Oct. 17 The United Nations Assoc, in  Canada and the BC Human Rights Coalition present a lecture entitled International Human Rights: Indigenous People's Perspective featuring Chief George  Manuel, Herb George and Marie Small-  face Marule.

Not only does Vito prompt us to see the representation (which is usually misrepresentation) of gays in film, he also provokes us to  examine our own political/ethical attitudes  which work to collude with our repression.  I found that I walked out of that movie  theatre with a feehng I never have quite  felt before. It was the feehng that aU of me  had been engaged and addressed. When we  do see the rare film about lesbians' lives,  it seems we often leave the theatre with  mixed feehngs: pleased to have been present  on the screen but frustrated that those lesbian characters' fives are so unhke our own.  There's seldom a context for their hves  (other than breaking up with men and being isolated), no herstory, no feminist community (no meetings!)—at best there might  be a fake lesbian bar.  The amazing thing for me about Vito's  commentary is that he has incorporated an  authentic feminist analysis. He pointed out  that when a woman appears in drag in a  movie she is stiU seen as provocative and  desirable, but when a man appears in drag,  he is seen as a fop and undesirable. Why?  Because the woman enhances herself with  a male persona whUe a man weakens himself with a female persona: he's a joke. Few  men would ever really want to be a woman.  This unveUed sexism caused some of the gay  men in the audience to shift in their seats  but Vito is determined to "wake people up  to the images on the screen ... I want us  to see what's being done to us."  Get your tickets early as it's bound to seU  out.  Betsy Warland  Vancouver, B.C.

How often have  you thought-l wish I knew what this feeling is about?-or-Why am I doing this  again and again? You want to know but  the circumstances seem too overwhelming. Fear, anger and depression keep you  distant from your understanding. There  are simple, direct and grounded ways to  help yourself. You can develop new skills.  Using a few new tools, your ability to  take charge will be in your own hands.  There is no miracle. It is a step by step  process that starts now. I am offering a  10 week workshop in Finding Self-Raising  Spirit. Designed for the participants, we  will focus on goal-setting, body-mind integration, creative visualization and much  more. I am a feminist working for social change by supporting the individual  woman to find her inner light. I also work  on a wide range of political issues as a cultural/community worker, and I am a certified Hypnotist and Polarity Therapist.  For more info call Brenda R. Bryan 732-  8927.
