It's...short. And everything seems to  happen as we're going to press... 'cos most of us are just beginning to get used to the fact it's  a new month. Know what we mean?..."it's what? It's February? But wasn't it January jus' a  ; ^ short while back?...oh, 15 days ago." Makes for crazee production days.  But then, we kinda enjoy it too 'cos it's the big build-up before International Women's  Day. It's exciting to see the IWD ads comin' in...hey, there's one about the IWD cabaret at  the Cultch! Great movies at the NFB's IWD film series...wait a minute, is that a bathtub?!  And then there are the firsts-Lillooet, BC is having its' first organized IWD celebration.  Oh, and there are two IWD marches this year. One's being organized by a few groups,  including, we think, Roots of Resistance. The plan is to have a full day of free workshops,  childcare, food, a moment of silence on Main and Hastings, followed by a march to  Oppenheimer Park to commemorate and celebrate 1993 being the Year of Indigenous  Peoples. It's on March 8th and 571-1992 is the number to call for more info or for  volunteering.  The other one, though there hasn't been much press about it yet, is the (in)famous IWD  march and rally at the Queen-E and Art Gallery on March 6th..the theme is Women and the  Economy (covers jus' about everything, don't it?)...bring a banner...rest your vocal chords  too...we're gonna be real loud this year!  Speaking of which, women being loud is really getting the federal government's goat  these days-okay, so they've always been irked by (mad at?) us for refusing to keep quiet but  •»-   we think we're seeing another intense stepping up of the DC (divide and conquer) tactics  of the feds...remember the referendum (what referendum?) last November? And the calls  made to NAC and the Quebec Fed of Women?  Well, the budget's coming down sometime soon (we figure April) and we already  know there will be 10 to 20 percent cuts to funding for women's groups. Even worse,  rumour has it some groups are being threatened with total cut-offs or else, their budgets are  being slashed so drastically, they're not going to be able to survive-some advocacy women's  groups have been told they "advocate" too much...?!! Most of us are being played off  against each other. We figure it's time to get together and refuse to let them play their game,  refuse to play DC with federal tax dollars, unite...do something really major to show they're  not getting away with it. It begins to feel really dangerous to speak out, especially when they  make you feel like yours is the only dissenting voice...but we're all saying the same thing!  Anyway, read our story on upcoming funding cuts on page 3. It doesn't get into what  we figure is in the provincial budget, but that's 'cos we can only guess at what's going to  happen—scenario one: there'll be no new monies for women's groups and women's centres  already funded will get to keep what they've got; scenario two, there'll be no new funding  for women's groups and women's groups already funded will see cuts. We may get a  glimpse of what's to come at a public meeting that we're gearing up to attend as Kinesis goes  to press. Finance minister Glen Clark and senior off icials will answer questions on the NDP's  pre-budget, financial outlook for BC. We'll let you know what happened in the next issue.  Also, in the next issue, we'll update you on what's happening with the Panel on  Violence Against Women's report that's due 'bout now. We haven't heard a thing as yet but  we're working on it.  We're also going to continue working on getting as much information about the new  immigration act and refugee rights in upcoming issues (see page 12).

Call 255 •5499  the recent National Association of Women and the Law conference in Vancouver on  Women's Rights are Human Rights, which had some interesting speakers on it, with a lot of  interesting information. We'll be running excerpts of the speeches next month.  Also next issue, we'll look at the new UI amendments, at the escalation of hindu  fundamentalism and how (if?) women fit in, and at classism in the feminist movement. We'll  also be running a herstory of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter.  As usual, the phone was ringing off the hook as Kinesis was going to press. Women  wanted to know why all the paraphernalia has been taken off the doors at the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective: "looks like they've moved, or something?" Yup. They're no  longer in the same building as us—they've moved to a building on West 8th, between Burrard  and Granville. Rumour has it, their new space is actually slated to be torn down sometime  in the next five to eight years but, oh heck, they love the new space for now...it's got (gasp)  fresh air galore, light and space! We're jealous. Actually, bet their view of the city's not as  spectacular as ours! The new space is also wheelchair accessible (an elevator and a ramp), and  comes with friendly neighbours-the BC Coalition of Abortion Clinics is in the same  building. The Health Collective won't be open 'till mid-March and we've heard they're  planning on an open house early next month. For their new address, see Bulletin Board.  Soon as we hung up on one call, another one came in, this time desperately (not really,  we're jus' using the cliche) seeking "lesbians anywhere on this planet of South Asian  ancestry" to contribute graphics, cartoons, poetry, fiction, prose, announcements, news, and  and and for publication in a new bi-annual journal by, for and about South Asian lesbians  called SamiYoni. There was no time to ask what that means but we'll find out next month.  Write to neesha dosanjh, Box 891, Stn. P, Toronto, Ont, M5S 2Z2.  The phone rang yet again and we agreed to let women know that there's a call out "for  women of the African diaspora to come together for collective action for ourselves" on  March 16 at 7.30 pm at 4540 Windsor in Vancouver. Call 522-2512 or 873-0905 for more info.  Another call. The Women of Colour Political Action Group will meet again at 245 E.  Broadway at 2 pm on March 17.  We thought that was it, we'd print this, paste it up and send Kinesis to press when. ..yeah,  the phone rang...Persimmon Blackbridge will be showing her sculpture about conditions  within an institution at the Charles H. Scott Gallery at Emily Carr College of Art, 1399  Johnstone St., Granville Island. The exhibition is called Sunnybrook, and runs from March  19 to May 2nd, daily from noon to 5 pm. Oh yeah, and there's a bit of a bash for the opening  on March 18th at 8 pm. Call 844-3811.  Before the phone rings again, we're going to sign off. We're a half-hour past deadline  and there's no time to tell you all we know, have heard, or seen...as Kinesis goes to press.  Happy International Women's Day to  all our readers—you'll notice that Bulletin  Board includes a special section on IWD  events in Vancouver, and a few from around  the province.  We're happy to present the second in  our series of histories of women's organizations in Vancouver. This month we're looking at the India Mahila Association (see page  10). Some of the organizations we hope to  profile in coming months are the Vancouver  Women's Bookstore, the International Women's Day Committee, Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre, Vancouver Women's  Health Collective, Vancouver Transition  House, Rape Relief, and WAVAW. If there's  a group you'd like to profile, call Fatima at  255-5499.  Welcome to our new writers this month:  Theresa Beer, Sarah Evans, and Laiwan.  Thanks to all and we hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. We were ad-  heavy this month so some of the articles sent  to us did not run this issue. We'll be running  them next month.  Lots of experienced volunteers helped  out with production this month, and we'd  like to say thanks to all, and hello to one new  face, Jeannie Vuksinic, who entertained us  with her stories of celebrity encounters and  is quite the proofreader to boot. Thanks,  Jeannie.  To all our volunteers, past and present:  we'd like your input! We're in the process of  trying to make the volunteer experience more  meaningful for everyone, so watch for our  feedback forms.  They'll be available for pick up at the  end of March, and we'd love you to pass  them around to friends who have been involved with Kinesis in the past and may have  lost touch.  We're also looking for volunteers to  help out with some computer instruction. If  you feel confident about your skills in  WordPerfect 5.1 and /or PageMaker 4.0, and  would like to share your expertise, please  call Anne at 255-5499. You'd be helping  other volunteers pick up valuable skills.  Well, February was a warm month,  weather-wise, and we're hoping for more of  the same in March...the sunshine has brought  us some spectacular sunsets and the view  from our production room is unbelievable.  If you'd like to believe, come to a writers'  meeting or production. No experience is  necessary and it's always fun, so give us a  call at (604) 255-5499.  photographers and  illustrators  we want to see your photos  and artwork on the pages  of Kinesis  give us a call @ 255*5499  MARCH 1993 SecState funding cuts:  Death of a thousand cuts  by Nancy Pollak   It is known as the death of a thousand  cuts-wearing your victim down with small,  unremarkable blows until they are too diminished to protest, too weak to survive.  And it is the federal government's preferred  method of silencingwomen'sgroups~a slow  but steady slicing of money from funding  programs, notably the Secretary of State's  Women's Program.  But the latest cut, delivered last December in a bland paragraph in Finance Minister  Don Mazankowski's "mini-budget," is being challenged by women's groups across  the country who are determined to not just  stop the bleeding, but to gain a fresh infusion  of money.  The Tories' mini-budget, which also  froze some public sector salaries and further  curtailed the Unemployment Insurance program [see page 7], cut grants and subsidies to  most organizations and so-called interest  groups by 10 percent in each of the next two  years.  The Women's Program, which has hovered around $11 million for the last four  years, was not spared. The program provides grants to women's groups through  short-term project dollars or annual operational (core) funding. The program itself has  been shrinking since the 1988-89 fiscal year,  a victim of direct cuts (30 percent between  1989-91) and inflation. Grants are rarely  adequate-most groups rely heavily on volunteer and under-paid labour-and now local women's centres, research and advocacy  groups, and national organizations such as  the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC), are facing additional  20 percent cuts over the next two years.  Feminists have been mobilizing against  Mazankowski's move since the beginning of  the year. Representatives from 25 national  organizations demanded a meeting with  Women's Program bureaucrats in Montreal  on January 22nd—newly appointed Secretary of State Monique Landry was unable to  attend-but received little information.  At a subsequent meeting with Landry  on February 15th, the minister stated that,  while she would recommend a five-year  extension of the program itself—the Women's Program was evaluated in 1992 and is  up for renewal this year—she had no intention of fighting the cuts within cabinet. Women's groups, according to Landry, would  just have to do more with less.  Doing more with less is only one consequence of the Tory cut. Women informed  Landry that their groups are being forced to  compete with each other, are unable to do  effective long-term planning, and feel increased pressure to tailor their projects and  activities to fit government criteria, thus  threatening their ability to define issues from  a grassroots perspective.  In Vancouver, women have been meeting since mid-February to develop a fightback strategy. Groups include the Vancouver Status of Women (VSW), the Committee  for Domestic Workers and Care Givers, Rape  Joan Meister works with DAWN both  provincially and nationally. Founded in 1987,  DAWN Canada has applied for and never  received core funding.  "They've promised it to us since the  beginning, several Bouchards ago, but now  they've stopped talking about it," says  Meister. DAWN receives project funding  from two SecState departments—Women's  Programs and the Disabled Persons Participation Program. This year, they were granted  Relief, Women Against Violence Against  Women (WAVAW), the Downtown Ea stside  Women's Centre, the Indian Homemakers,  DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN) BC,  the Women's Research Centre, the Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of BC,  NAC and others.  The Vancouver network is particularly  concerned that groups which have historically never gained core funding-immigrant  women, women of colour and women with  disabilities-are being shut out on a permanent basis.  "With the funding cut, there's now no  room for previously unfunded groups like  the Philippine Women's Centre or the South  Asian Women's Action Network," says  VSW's Chris Rahim. "The Tories say they're  committed to these 'doubly disadvantaged'  women, but their actions prove it's just hollow rhetoric."  Women may still scramble for a share of  thedecreased project funding, butcore funding is essential to a group's effectiveness.  "With core funding, groups have some stability and some control over their political  agenda," says NAC's Jackie Larkin.  The Vancouver network is calling for  increases to the Women's Program and for  affirmative action funding for these groups.  only 60 percent of what they requested-  $60,000 for a national symposium on New  Reproductive Technologies, and $60,000 for  regional development (DAWN has six provincial affiliates).  "Never before was the money so specifically allocated," says Meister. "And  $60,000 isn't enough for either [activity].  Certainly, there's no money for a national  office. They've given us enough money to  fail.  "Consider the expenses we face as a  national organization: When we meet, we  need sign language interpreters in French  and English-two of each, since they need to  spell off. We may need to travel with attendants, which doubles travel expenses. And  we can't stay in cheap hotels because they  aren't wheelchair accessible or accommodating to other special needs. The fact that  DAWN still exists is a miracle, and a testimony to how necessary we are."  While groups representing disabled  peoples have been exempted from these recent cuts, Meister finds only cold comfort:  "Ten percent more than insufficient is still  insufficient."  Other groups denied core funding include the Congress of Black Women of  Canada, and the National Organization of  Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of  Canada (NOIVMW). In BC, NOIVMW's  provincial affiliate engages in advocacy and  public education-just the sorts of activities  the Women's Program is mandated to support. "We want core funding and we've  been trying to get it," says IVMWBC's Vidya  Sharma. "We don't have an office, we work  out of our homes and 99 percent of our work  is done by volunteers. And the government is promoting multiculturalism, but  multicultural groups have also been cut. To  be effective, we need help."  In the spring of 1990, the Tories announced an abrupt end to funding for women's centres and feminist publications, as  well as severe cuts to national research and  advocacy groups. The 100 percent cut to  women's centres proved a miscalculation.  Feminists rallied across the country and,  through sit-ins, demonstrations, effective  media work, hard lobbying and parliamentary support from NDP and Liberal MPs, the  Tories were forced to re-instate $1.2 million  to women's centres. The other cuts remained.  "The Tories may need to be taught another lesson," says VSW'sChris Rahim. "Evidently, they have learned to shave, not hack,  at women's groups, but their long-term goal  may be the same: to prevent us from criticizing policies which hurt women." Rahim  cited the North American Free Trade Agreement and cuts to social programs as examples.  "We need to resist the cuts, and to demand that the government help, not hurt,  women in these difficult economic times.  We need to ask for more, not less."  As a first step, a national mail-in campaign to stop the cuts was launched in February. The idea is to mail a succession of  symbolic objects to Prime Minister Brian  Mulroney (Centre Block, Rm 309-S, House  of Commons, Ottawa KlA 0A6) and Finance Minister Don Mazankowski (House  of Commons, as above). The mailing schedule: March 1-15: a purse (yup, a real purse:  "there is nothing left,our wallets areempty").  March 15-30: a small envelope ("the budgetary envelope is too small"). April 1-30: a  birthday candle (The Women's Program is  20 years old in 1993. "Twenty years, we  want $20 million dollars"). No stamps are  required.  Watch your local community for other  actions. In southern BC, contact NAC regional representative Jackie Larkin at (604)  253-5068.   Nancy Pollak was one of many women  arrested in 1990 during the protests  against Women's Program funding cuts.  Caught in a corporate game  by Sarah Evans  Canada's new drug patent legislation  "hits at the very heart of women's equality,"  says Jennifer Johnstone of the Vancouver  Status of Women (VSW).  The legislation, which was passed last  month, effectively wipes out women's options to obtain cheaper generic drugs as  alternatives to high-priced brand name pharmaceuticals.  Commenting on women's positions as  key consumers of prescription medicines,  midwife and UBC professor Alison Rice  says, "we know that women tend to be  overprescribed—women are more likely to  be prescribed medication than men, women  are usually poorer, women tend to live longer  and thus to suffer from a variety of age-  related health problems requiring medication."  Sherrill Parker, a registered nurse affiliated with Vancouver's Positive Women's  Network, points out that the bill will have a  particularly negative effect on women with  AIDS.  "Many HIV positive women are mothers; very many of them in a single-mother  situation, very many of them in a financial  crunch," she says.  The new legislation Bill C-91 replaces  Canada's compulsory drug licensing law by  extending the 17-year patent to a 20-year  patent on all new drugs across the board.  The move marks a shift in federal drug  patent policy toward increasing market control by brand-name drug manufacturers.  "It's a matter of dollars and cents and  the companies want to make a dollar on it,"  says Parker. "Somebody wants to make a  buck, and somebody else remains sick."  What we're seeing here is a rationalization of our entire health care system, says  feminist economist Marjorie Cohen. "It's  moving towards being less and less inclu  sive." She points towards recent cuts in the  number of drugs covered by welfare.  "The ones that get hurt the most are  always the ones that are in a lower income  group—and we know that's where most  women are," she says.  The federai government itself acknowledges that the move will push drug prices  up by about $129 million over the next five  years and that's a conservative estimate,  according to the nine provincial health ministers Quebec, which has consistently stood  in opposition to the bill.  See DRUG page 4 ==^=^^=  MARCH 1993 News  "Wrongful dismissal" at Legal Services Society:  Tait files  suit  by Punam Khosla and Fatima Jaffer  The former director of Native Programs  at Legal Services Society of BC (LSS), is  charging the LSS with "wrongful dismissal"  and "discrimination...on the basis of race,  ancestry, political belief and sex." The civil  suit and human rights complaint were both  filed in early February.  Theresa Tait, a First Nations woman,  says she was fired last October, without  notice, or payment in lieu of notice, from her  job as director. She had held the position for  over five years and worked with LSS since  1984.  LSS's executive director Richard Dalon  says he was unable to comment on the reason for Tait's departure from LSS, or even to  say whether it was a "dismissal." Says  Dalon, "it is inappropriate for me to com  ment ...while we are still preparing [LSS's  legal] defence." He also says that, because it  is a personnel matter, it is confidential anyway.  Tait's complaint to the human rights  commission states that, "upon his appointment as the new executive director of the  Legal Services Society on June 12,1992, Mr  Richard Dalon began a campaign of harassment, interference and intimidation against  [Tate] in her role as director of Native Programs Branch."  In her complaint, she further explains,  "I believe this campaign was motivated in  part by Mr. Dalon's discriminatory attitudes  and beliefs regarding Native Aboriginal people. I made Mr. Dalon aware of my political  commitment to the rights, concerns and needs  of Native people in British Columbia. I believe Mr. Dalon made it increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible for me to  DRUG from page 3 ^=^^^^^~  The new rules will drive drug prices up  as much as 35 percent to US pricing levels,  according to BC Health Minister Elizabeth  Cull.  "This is a real threat," says Day. "This is  going to drive up the costs of Medicare and  put another squeeze on an already threatened health care system."  And Cohen further cites the potential  increase in costs of hospital care as a cause  for concern.  Provincesarealreadycallingon the government to use federal tax dollars to offset  the anticipated increase in costs to provincial  drug plans. But the federal government has  no plans for compensation.  Canada's old drug patent policy was a  thorn in the side of multinational pharmaceutical companies. Multinationals have been  lobbying trade negotiators for changes over  the last couple of years. Their demands have  been met to the letter, including a provision  that the new legislation be retroactive to  December 20,1991.  It will be difficult for future Canadian  governments to change the bill, which is part  of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and will be included in the  upcomingUruguay round of General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs (GATT) international trade talks.  According to Day, "[Bill C-91] is one of  the early blows of NAFTA. This gives us  some evidence of the kind of damage NAFTA  will do."  Ironically, the move comes at a time  when the US government is launching an  attack against high drug costs and low-quality health care in the US. Hilary Clinton,  chair of a review of the health care system in  the US, publicly criticized drug-industry  "profiteering," which she blames for the  US's embarrassingly low track record in  child immunization.  Despite the permanency of the new legislation, the government did not adequately  explore all options before pushing the bill  through parliament, critics claim.  The government ignored the concerns  of the public, cut off protests from the opposition in both the House of Commons and  the Senate, and used the Tory majority to  push the bill through parliament. In record  time, Bill C-91 was approved less than 24  hours after it received a 38-31 majority in the  Senate.  "This is a rogue government and this is  the way they do things," says Cohen. "They  have just rammed [Bill C-91] through."  Sarah Evans works at the Carnegie Centre  in Vancouver.

Tait's "dismissal" came shortly after  she sent a memo to Dalon detailing her  concerns that the autonomy and role of Native Programs within the LSS was being  seriously altered.  The Native Programs Branch at LSS was  born in 1975 as a result of direct lobbying by  Aboriginal groups of the NDP government.  As a result of a 1982 Native Task Force,  Native Programs policy wasadopted by LSS  in 1984 with three key elements: a recognition that Native peoples need specifically  targeted legal services; that services be identified and delivered by Native peoples; and  that the Native Programs Branch at LSS  serve as a bridge between Native communities and LSS.  "I made Mr. Dalon aware  of my political  commitment to the  rights, concerns and  needs of Native people  in British Columbia."  —Theresa Tait  When Dalon became executive director  he says he began "a process of restructuring  and reorganising" LSS. "There was a management crisis ...[and] I built a new management team," says Dalon. Structural changes  include: setting up a number of committees,  including a policy-making Executive Committee, of which Dalon was part; hiring a  deputy executive director of LSS; and making "changes to the functional relationships  between departments and with the Board."  Tait's memo to Dalon raises questions  and asks for written clarification about some  of the organizational changes instituted by  Dalon, which have resulted in the exclusion  of Native Programs Branch staff from LLS's  executive committee.  Tait's human rights claim states that, in  the months leading up to her "dismissal",  Dalon "forbade me from communicating  directly with members of the LSS board."  Dalon's response is that "in my view,  the Board has one employee and that's me. I  asked all the staff that anything that was  going to the Board be sent to the executive  committee first....because, as I see it, I am the  only one responsible to the Board."  Tait's memo also expresses concern that  changes to contracts between the LSS and  BC's ten Native Community Law Offices  (NCLOs) could erode community control of  the Native-run offices. She underlined that,  according to LSS's policy, the Native Programs Branch has a unique mandate in serving as a "bridge between Native Communities and the Legal Services Society".  "Dalon...took steps to exclude me from  meetings with various Native organizations  and Native Community Law Offices," says  Tait, in her complaint "The effect was to  isolate me from the Native groups who were  my constituency as Director of the Native  Programs Branch..."  She further states that she and her staff  "were excluded from a meeting....between  Mr. Dalon and representatives of the  NCLO...[whereas] liaising with the NCLOs  was one of my primary responsibilities".  According to a statement by the Friends  of Native Programs, Tait was "...fired for  sending a copy [of this memo] to the Native  Community Law Offices."  Michelle Hill of the Vancouver Status of  Women expressed her concerns on the matter. In a letter to Dalon, she states, "these  actions are taking Legal Services 20 years  backwards in its relationship with Native  people, at a time when provincial and federal governments are scrambling to negotiate self government and land claims."  The events at LSS leave open the question of what political direction the Native  Programs Branch at LSS will take.  In 1991, an Aboriginal Justice Committee was set up to revise LSS policy on delivery of legal services to First Nations communities. Made up of Rosalee Tizya, Wilf  Adams, Lou Demerais, Theresa Tait and a  number of other representatives from Native communities, the Committee agreed by  consensus to work towards the creation of a  separate Aboriginal Justice Society, with a  series of interim measures to work towards  that goal.  The Committee, created by the LSS  board, has been frustrated by a lack of financial support from the LSS board to complete  its work. The Committee has been unable to  produce a final report to date.  According to Dalon, the whole concept  of a separate AboriginalJusticeSocietyisnot  necessarily supported by the members of the  BCANCLO, a provincial body made up of  staff at BC's ten NCLOs.  However, Tait suggests that NCLO staff  may be reacting to suggestions that a separate Aboriginal Justice Society would be  more vulnerable to funding cuts by government, and that jobs may be lost without the  paternalistic support of LSS.  Tait says that, according to questionnaires sent out to the Native communities by  the Aboriginal Justice Committee, there was  widespread community support for a separate society.  Since Tait's departure as director of  Native Programs Branch, the LSS has received a number of letters of concern about  thepoliticalimplicationsoftherecentchanges  at LSS. Nancy Sandy of Friends of Native  Programs and an active member of the LSS  working group to set up a Vancouver Native  Community Legal Office, in a memo to the  LSS board of directors, states: "We are extremely concerned about the direction that  the society is taking in respect to the delivery  of services to Native people."  Among others expressing similar concerns are The Aboriginal Women's Council,  members of theLSS's Native Task Force, The  United Native Nations, the Director of UBC's  First Nations Law Program, and the Chief of  The Carier Sekani Tribal Council.  Dalon says Tait's "departure" from LSS  "had absolutely nothing to do with race,  gender or any human rights violation."  In the meantime, Penny Dejollais has  been hired to replace Tait as director of  Native Programs Branch at LSS. Dejollais is  a former employee of the Native Council of  Canada. She began her position at the begins  of this month.  Punam Khosla and Fatima Jaffer are writers  for Kinesis.  MARCH 1993 News  Canadian human rights amendments:  Not a pleasant package  by Shannon e. Ash   Women's groups, human rights organizations and unions across Canada are gearing up for a fight as parliament gets ready to  debate yet another regressive piece of legislation. This time it's Bill C-l 08—a package of  amendments to the CanadianHuman Rights  Act.  The proposed amendments are a "disgraceful show," says Shelagh Day of the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC), speaking at a press conference in Vancouver. Day based her comments on a lengthy analysis of Bill C-l 08 that  she prepared for NAC.  She says while amendments to the outdated Human Rights Act have been long-  awaited, court interventions and decisions  "are ahead of what the government is proposing for law." This government's attempt  is to amend legislation that has caused government losses [in the courts] and "serves  the interests of government, not people," she  says.  The press conference was held in former  justice minister Kim Campbell's Vancouver  Centre riding because, says Day, Campbell  isdirectlyresponsiblefortneseamendments.  As well, she says it is Campbell and not Tory  backbenchers who should be held responsible for the scrapping of theCourt Challenges  program and for directing that crown attorneys oppose human rights cases in court [see  Kinesis, Dec./Jan. 93].  Steven Hammond, representing the gay  and lesbian organization OutSpoken, echoes Day's comments on Campbell's responsibility.  "She sets the standard—deciding which  cases will be fought, and which cases will be  supported, or left alone. Therefore it is Ms.  Campbell, not her back bench, who must  accept responsibility for denying basic human rights and equality for men and women  who are gay and lesbian."  The speakers at the press conference  focused on how the proposed amendments  would affect human rights.  Sexual orientation  After Campbell stated in November last  year that she wouldnot introduce an amendment to include sexual orientation in the  Human Rights Act—following court decisions which effectively did this [see Kinesis,  Dec/Jan. 93J—Campbell did a turn-around  and introduced this amendment. However,  it includes a proposed new definition of  marital status.  plans, bereavement leave, and others—currently available to heterosexual employees.  The federal government has opposed all  these cases and has appealed any gains.  By limiting the definition of marital status to apply only to heterosexual relationships, the amendment effectively ensures  that lesbians would be denied such benefits  and that access to immigration—being able  to sponsor a spouse—would be limited.  barbara findlay of OutRights calls the  amendment a "blatant attempt at discrimination in the human rights act."  And as Hammond put it, "No thanks,  Ms. Campbell. We're doing better in the  courts."  Marital status is currently undefined  and open to interpretation. The proposed  amendments define marital status as "being  married, single, separated, divorced, widowed or cohabiting with an individual of the  opposite sex in a conjugal relationship for at  least one year."  In a number of recent court cases, gay  men and lesbians have been fighting to gain  the spousal employment benefits—health  "it's [the amendment]  a package that needs to  be scrapped. We need to  start all over again."  —Shelagh Day, NAC  Something is going to have to happen!  About 200 women, children and men gathered at Vancouver's Oppenheimer Park  on February 14 for a smudge (Native ceremony) to pay tribute to women who have  died violently in the Downtown Eastside.  "The sexism and the racism and the indifference of the authorities towards our  women must stop," said Vivian Sandy, one of the organisers of the protest to  demand support services for women of the Downtown Eastside, and public  scrutiny of a racist police system.  People carried signs with the names of 48 women—mostly Native—who were  murdered in the Downtown Eastside, as we formed a healing circle and then  marched through the streets and alleys where women had died—the Marr Hotel,  where Cindy Williams died, the Four Sisters Co-op where Wendy Poole's body  was found, and the alley behind the Regent Hotel, where Trish Wad dams body  was found.  Accommodation  This amendment would require that,  for an employer to uphold a job qualification  or refusal of service which discriminates  against a person, it must be demonstrated  that the "accommodation" of (or making  changes to satisfy) the needs of this person  (or group of persons) would impose an "undue hardship" on the employer.  This is basically a limitation on equality  guarantees, developed to limit employer liability. The government definition of "undue hardship" includes "operational effectiveness," which could cover everything.  As Mary Williams of the BC Coalition of  People with Disabilities (BCCPD) says, this  amendment would set a lower standard than  is presently being set by the courts. Disabled  people may require changes to job duties  and work arrangements as well as buildings  and services, and the definition of "undue  hardship" is crucial.  "If a limitation on a right is too broad,  the right becomes meaningless," says  Williams. She points out the Ontario government's definition of undue hardship is  more limited—it includes only cost or health  and safety regulations.  Williams also notes that there are  broader implications; for example, "operational effectiveness" could conceivably be  applied to deny maternity leave.  Immigration  This amendment exempts the Immigration Act from some human rights complaints.  It includes any complaints by persons seek-  ' ing admission to Canada who have been  refused admission by Canadian officials  - outside the country. This includes visitor,  immigrant and student visas, or work permits, all of which have to be applied for  outside Canada.  The federal government has previously  lost a case where they argued that the Human Rights Commission has no jurisdiction  to investigate complaints concerning immigration decisions.  "This [amendment] will amount to discrimination, not only to those outside the  country,butalsoagainsttheirCanadian relatives and friends who live inside Canada  and wish to sponsor and assist them," says  Sunera Thobani of the South Asian Women's Action Network (SAWAN).  There have been a number of cases recently where relatives and friends of Canadian citizens and immigrants were denied  visitors visas, even after having provided  evidence that they intended to return to their  country.  Thobani argues that the exemption,  which allows immigration officials to discriminate with impunity, could lead to discrimination against immigrants in Canada  and increase hostility at a time "when we see  an increase in racist attacks and violence  against people of colour. This is another  blow following the passage of the regressive  Bill C-86 [see page 12]."  Removing guideline-making power  This amendment would remove the  power of the HRC to make binding guidelines for the interpretation of the human  rights act by tribunal members.  A representative from the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) calls the legislation "blatantly self-serving." Marian  Meagher says the government is trying to  "protect itself from future human rights challenges, particularly around employment  practices and policy."  For example, in 1978, the HRC set out  guidelines on how to assess work of "equal  value" for equal pay laws. The federal government lost a court case challenging the  guidelines, arguing that the guidelines were  beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission  to make. Following the approval of this  amendment, such guidelines would no  longer be binding on government.  Meagher says the amendment is evidence of the "level of moral bankruptcy to  which the government is willing to drop in  its attempt to abrogate its responsibility as  an employer." She says the government has  been unresponsive to the complaints of female employees regarding equal pay, and it  now appears they have no intention of honouring the equal pay law, particularly as it  applies to back pay.  This amendment also affects the definition of "undue hardship" in accommodating people with disabilities, says BCCPD's  Williams. The HRC would be unable to make  binding guidelines for defining undue hardship, and the government's open-ended definition could go unchallenged.  There are a few positive amendments in  the package, including acknowledgement  of multiple discrimination, expanding the  criteria for appointment of human rights  tribunal members, and a provision to pay  costs incurred by complainants who win  their cases without HRC assistance.  But, says Shelagh Day, "when you weigh  the whole thing together, it's a package that  needs to be scrapped. We need to start all  over again."  According to Day, neither the NDP nor  the Liberals have said whether they will  oppose the Bill as yet. It's unusual for a party  to reject an entire bill, but it has happened,  says Day. She says she is doubtful the substantive issues in the bill could be addressed  through amendments to the package.  Both Day and Meagher emphasize the  importance of immediate lobbying to have  Bill C-108 thrown out, especially since the  Conservatives have been invoking closure  on House debates and legislative committees.  However, the press conference, called  to draw attention to this urgency, was poorly  attended by mainstream media. The audience was made up of people from communities most affected by the bill.

Government Employees' Union  MARCH 1993 What's News  by Lissa Geller and Teresa Beer  UIC cuts  —part two  Following protests from women's and  labour groups and some Quebec MPs to the  federal government's proposed legislation  on unemployment insurance cuts that target  mostly women, the government has withdrawn Bill C-105 and is replacing it with a  new bill.  But changes to the original legislation in  the new Bill C-l 13 are minor. Anyone who  quits their job "voluntarily" and without  "just cause" or who is fired will still recieve  no unemployment insurance (UI) [see Kinesis, Feb. 93J. Further, UI payments will still  be cut to 57 percent of workers' former  wages from 60 percent for at least the next  two years.  Women make up 53 per cent of voluntary UI quits, compared to 37 per cent of all  claimants.  Those earning low incomes, mothers  who can't find or afford child care, and  women who are sexually hara ssed on the job  continue to be the most affected by the legislation.  And while the government lists "sexual  harassment" as "just cause" for quitting a  job and entitles women who claim harassment to a private hearing, the onus is on the  woman to prove the abuse took place before  she can receive UI.  Among changes tabled by the new legislation is a provision that allows workers  who are laid off or who voluntarily quit a job  in a corpora te downsizing to receive UI. The  changes, once the bill is approved, should be  in effect by April 1.  Anti-stalking  legislation  After the violent death of a Winnipeg  woman at the hands of a man who had  stalked her, the calls from women's groups  to amend the Criminal Code to toughen  legislation have become louder and louder.  Twenty-five year old Terri-Lynn Babb was  repeatedly harassed by an obsessive ex-boyfriend who, despite being convicted of violating his peace bond, legally purchased a  hand gun and killed her earlier this month.  Toronto women's shelter supervisor  Maria Crawford points out that the current  laws are "supposedly there to keep women  safe, which they do not do." In 1990, 39  percent of women killed in Canada were  murdered by their partner or ex-partner.  Many of the women were stalked, harassed  and threatened before their deaths.  Two recent private members' bills are  attempting to deal with Canada's out-of-  date peace bond and stalking laws, which  are ineffective as a deterrent to violence  against women.  Bill C-390, introduced by MP George  Rideout, would amend the Criminal Code to  make it an indictable offence to "willfully,  maliciously and repeatedly" follow or  threaten a person.  The new law would carry a penalty of  up to one year in prison for a first offence or  two years for a repeat offence.  Currently, the law allows people to be  charged with harassment, but this involves  only up to six months in jail and is a "summary" offence. This means that a woman  who is being stalked must lay charges herself and the stalker must be caught in the act  in order to be charged.  Bill C-368, introduced by MP Mary  Clancy, recieved first reading in November,  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTfTTTTT  THE WORLD IS NOT A FAIR PLACE  ...ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN  T Women do nearly two-thirds of  the world's work and receive  only one-tenth of its income.

A  peace bond is designed to prevent a person  from contacting someone they have threatened or assaulted. If a person violates the  bond, they forfeit the money they have been  forced to pay. If they continue to violate the  bond, they can be jailed, but this is usually a  longanddifficultprocess.Previously,judges  could use their discretion whether or not to  issue a bond.  As well, the Bill would make the violation of a peace bond an indictable offence,  meaning a person could be jailed for it,  rather than just forfeiting the bond money.  Tougher anti-stalking legislationis now  in place in over 30 states in the US and is  proving to offer increased protection for  women from embittered spouses and boyfriends.  Jackie Vollmer of the Fairfax police department in Virginia notes that "a lot of the  time we go down to these domestic situations, and before, if someone was hanging  out, there was nothing we could do.... Now,  if this person feels their safety is in  jeopardy...there is something we can do."  For a new definition  of self defence  The Canadian Association of Elizabeth  Fry Societies is calling on the federal government to expand the legal definition of self-  defence to include battered women who kill  their abusers.  The Association, which provides advocacy and services to women in Canadian  prisons, is requesting a government review  of cases where women are serving sentences  for killing their abusers, with an aim to  reforming the laws around these cases.  "These women acted out of desperation  and killed their partners. [A review] is the  only way to examine how abuse has been  looked at by the criminal justice system"  said executive director, Kim Pate.  The demand for a review follows a 1990  Supreme Court decision, in which the Court  upheld a decision acquitting a Winnipeg  woman, Angelique Lavallee, of shooting and  killingher common-law husband. This landmark ruling recognized battered wife syndrome as a defence in cases where women  kill their partners following years of abuse.  TheAssociationhasidentifiedl2women  currently in federal prison in Canada who  were convicted of killing their abusive partners before the Lavallee ruling.  Sheila Noonan, a feminist law theorist  at Queen's University, says the cases of these  women should be reexamined, particularly  since "...women convicted of killing abusive  partners since the Lavallee decision are not  always jailed, and when they are, their jail  terms are shorter."  A human-rights  free zone  A former UBC student has taken the  University of British Columbia (UBC) to the  Canadian Supreme Court in its attempt to  have the university declared a human-rights-  free zone.  Following a BC Supreme Court decision that effectively makes the university a  human-rights-free zone, the federal court  has agreed to hear the case, which could  have far-reaching implications, not just for  universities and colleges, but for banks and  other institutions.  Janice Berg was a Master's student living with clinical depression. When she asked  for a rating sheet from her faculty so she  could intern with the Canadian Dietetic Association, the faculty refused. She was also  denied keys to laborotaries that are routinely  handed out to other graduate students.  Berg took UBC to the BC Human Rights  Council and, in 1985, won a $2,000 judgement against them for viola ting her rights on  the grounds of her mental disability.  UBC appealed the decision on the  grounds that the human rights code only  bars discrimination on services "customarily available to the public" and its services  are not intended for the public but rather for  a select group-students. The Supreme  Court of BCagreed and overturned the judgement.  At issue is whether or not a university  has an obligation to operate within the  boundaries of human rights legislation in  this country. They claim to be outside of it,  but this same argument could be used by  banks to refuse to issuecredit cards to women  or people of colour. Since it isn't a "public  service," they could do what they want.  Berg's lawyer, David Mossop, says he  hopes the court will ask itself what an ordinary person could expect from the university. "An ordinary person would expect that  his or her son or daughter would not be  denied a key or a rating sheet because they  belonged to a certain group."  JUSTICE  INSTITUTE  0FB£  Greetings  on  INTERNATIONAL  WOMEN'S DAY  Interdisciplinary Studies  Justice Institute of B.C.  Offering Courses for Professional Development  and Community Education  4180 West 4th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., V6R 4J5, (604) 228-9771  MARCH 1993 Feature   NAFTA and health care  by Colleen Fuller  The mainstream press, governments and  private think-tanks are questioning whether  we can "afford" medicare. In this article, I  will look at the Canada-US deal and those  elements in it that pertain to health care, and  then outline the changes which have occurred in the health care sector since January  1989 when the Free Trade Agreement (FTA)  came into effect. Next, I will examine what's  in the proposed North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) agreement and outline what I believe is a direction we, as health  care workers and users, must go if we are to  successfully defend our medicare system.  Our federal government is clearly not  interested in funding or overseeing medicare and has taken legislative steps to end its  financial participation. Provincial governments are chipping away at the services  provided under our provincial health plans  and many are embarking on a radical restructuring of the system.  Heal th ca re workers and those who need  health care the most, the majority of whom  are women, are among the first to see the  results of restructuring within a framework  of financial restraint:  - Women's jobs are being lost and beds  are closing in hospitals, such as Vancouver's  Shaughnessy hospital, across the country;  - The struggle for safe working conditions, including safe work loads, is being  undermined by layoffs and cutbacks;    .  • Our demands for pay equity are being  subordinated to the "pay off the debt" priorities of our governments;  • The hospitals where the majority of  health care workers are employed are losing  ground to underfunding, under-unionized  non-profit agencies;  • Women are having to pick up the work  in the home;  • Women are having to pay the high cost  for ourselves, our children, the elderly we  take care of;  • Older women are made to feel they are  placing an unfair burden on the rest of us  because they rely heavily on the health care  system.  The Canada-US Deal:  What's Really in it?  I'm sure all of you remember the reassuring words of big business and the federal  government during the 'Tree Trade Debate"  in 1987 and 1988.  They said that the FTA exempted Medicare, family allowance, old age pensions and  unemployment insurance and that this was  proof that the deal posed no threat to social  programs.  Four years later:  • we no longer have the Family Allowance;  • Ottawa is under-funding Unemployment Insurance;  • old age pensions are being sunsetted;  \    /  For women who are stretching boundaries  \         k  And think broadest maybe describes them best  \SL /  And wonder if women's clothes in size 0  Isn't really some very bad jest  ;  For women out there who are larger  And realize this is their fate  1^ I  I carry clothes that are bigger  MK  I know, isn't that that great!  l    Quality consignment  \  clothing  (s  1 Size 14... plus  r  I    Amplesize Park  ,1     5766 Fraser Street  W      Vancouver, BC  s  V5W2Z5  \  Sarah-Jane (604)322-0107  Eastside DataGraphics  1460 Commercial Drive  tel: 255-9559 fax: 253-3073  Happy  International ^ Day  - Onion Shop  Call or fax and we'll send you our monthly  flyer of great office supply specials.

This is only a partial glimpse of what is  happening to our public sector and our social programs and it doesn't include, for  example, abandoned promises—like a national daycare~program.  The question we need to ask ourselves,  however, is how much of what's happening  is the result of the FTA, and how much  because the Tories are simply opposed to  funding social programs?  Chapter 14 of the FTA outlines how  commercial services are approached. Included in the chapter are a broad range of  hospital and health care management services, including general rehabilitation and  extended care hospitals. Included are also  nursing care homes, drug and alcohol treatment facilities, homes for the physically and  mentally disabled, homes for children in  need of protection, ambulance services,  health rehabilitation clinics, home care services, public health clinics, medical laboratories, radiology laboratories and blood banks.  This is a very long list of exemptions to  the exemption of medicare from the FTA.  Canada has not considered health care  to be a commercial-for-profit service since  the introduction of Medicare. Rather, we  place it in the public sector. We need to look  at how the FTA introduced the notion that  certain health care services are appropriately private sector, for-profit activities.  In addition to services specifically included in chapter 14, we now know that the  free trade negotiations resulted in Bill C-22,  which extended patents on name-brand  drugs from four years to ten. Although Ottawa still vehemently denies any connection  between the deal and the legislation, a US  summary of the FTA published in 1987 noted  a Canadian promise to pass legislation extending patent protection for the multinational drug companies.  And according to a recent story in The  New York Times, the Canadian government  committed itself to extending the patent on  name-brand drugs to 20 years in order to  ensure ratification of the free trade agreement in the US.  Americans predicted Canadians would  spend billions of dollars more on prescription drugs when Bill C-91, extending patents  to 20 years by the end of the decade, passed  last month [see story this issue, page 4J.  What has been the result of these free  trade concessions? Are the multinationals,  in fact, streaming in to Canada to exercise  their rights in the health care sector under  the terms of the FTA?  Between 1984 and 1991, the health care  sector created more jobs in Canada than any  other sector of the economy. Much of this  growth has occurred since the FTA came  into effect.  The fastest growing industries in the  health care sector in Canada have been those  producing medical devices and phai  "A terrific book ...

Medical devices include everything  from surgical dressings to brain imaging  equipment.  Private laboratories, walk-in medical  clinics and various kinds of treatment facilities have sprung up like weeds in major  cities across the country. Hospitals are contracting out laundry, dietary and housekeeping services to large, US-based multinational corporations.  All of this activity has been assisted by  federal cutbacks and the FTA—and by big  government grants and interest free loans.  In Winnipeg, for example, Trimel Corporation is investing $30 million to set up a  state-of-the-art drug factory with the help of  nearly $13 million in interest-free loans from  the government of Manitoba.  Apotex, another drug company, is investing $19 million in a high-tech chemical  production and biotech complex in Winnipeg, with the help of government grants  totalling $9 million, at a time when both  federal and provincial governments are  warning us that we can no longer afford  Medicare.  The Canada Health Act was established  in 1984 to set criteria that each province was  required to meet in order to get federal  funding for health care. Those principles  are: universality, equal access to health care  services for all Canadians, the inclusion of a  comprehensive range of services in provincial health plans, the portability of health  care coverage from one province to another  and the public, non-profit administration of  health insurance.  Ottawa's ability to enforce the Canada  Health Act came from its funding of Medi-  The Act respected the jurisdiction of the  provinces over health, while ensuring that  national standards would be maintained.  Then in 1990, a year after signing the  FTA, the government introduced Bill C-69  This bill froze the amount of money the  provinces were entitled to through Established Programs Funding—money they got  on a per capita basis. In addition, it fixed the  rate of growth of cash transfers at GNP  minus 3 per cent, beginning this year. This  was a complicated way of saying that Ottawa was pulling out of Medicare.  By 1994, Ottawa will have withdrawn  almost $32 billion from the health care system. At the same time, the cost of drugs has  risen an average of 16 per cent per year since  Ottawa extended the length of patent protection to brand-name drugs, adding millions and millions of dollars to already  strained provincial health plans.  By the end of the decade, Bill C-91 will  have redirected billions of health care dollars to the multinational drug companies.  In 1996, Quebec will be the first province in Canada to lose all federal cash transfers for health. In 1998, Ontario will be the  second province—and the rest of the country will follow very closely behind.  I believe these bills are part of a bridge  between the free trade deal and the ability of  corporations to exercise the rights they have  been granted in the agreement.  In other words, the Canada Health Act  is acting as a barrier to US investment in the  health care sector and, therefore, the Canada  Health Act must go—or be made completely  irrelevant.  How have the provinces reacted to  Ottawa's legislative agenda?  In BC, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, major restructuring of the health care system is  underway. In these and other provinces,  services which used to be covered by provincial health plans are being removed and  picked up by private insurers.  These services range from annual checkups at a doctor's office to extended coverage  Women's Day  greetings from  B.C.'s largest union  for working women.  Fighting for  pay equity.  THE HOSPITAL  EMPLOYEES' UNION  for Canadians travelling outside the country.  Private diagnostic laboratories like  Metro-Macnair are involved in an aggressive campaign to capture business from hospitals confronting unsympathetic provincial governments and rising deficits. Many  of these companies have investments in the  US health care sector and have overlapping  interests with American business. In BC,  private US companies are now offering  mobile radiology laboratory services to financially strapped communities.  Provincial governments are moving the  delivery of health care services "closer to  home," as it is euphemistically called in BC  We know that means smaller, non-profit,  publicly-funded and largely non-unionized  agencies will replace many services now  located in hospitals.  These services are precisely those which,  because they are included in the free trade  agreement, are extremely vulnerable to the  large,aggressivecorporatesectorwhichnow  dominates the American health care system.  NAFTA: What's in it?  The North American Free Trade Agreement is the Canada-US deal expanded to  include Mexico and whole sectors, procedures, reviews, committees and commissions, and levels of government not included  in the FTA. The FTA binds the federal governments of Canada and the US to its terms  and conditions. NAFTA, however, binds all  levels of government, including provincial,  state and local governments. Local government refers to municipal councils and other  bodies elected by the public, including hospital boards.  For example, under NAFTA, US-based  corporations who bid on public contracts  could demand to be treated the same as  government-funded, non-profit agencies.

NAFTA doesn't respect the ability of  provinces to support pharmacare programs,  either. NAFTA sets up a process to review  public services which are presently excluded  because of existing laws—for example, the  Canada Health Act, or other provincial or  federal legislation; services such as community, social and professional services, including health and education.  NAFTA states that all of these exclusions must be reviewed no later than December 31,1998. They will be reviewed by appointees from all three governments.  This is not our vision—it is not the vision  of the women of Canada nor a vision of  women's health clinics in every community.  I believe there are three steps we must take if  our medicare system is to survive for our  children and grandchildren:  • first, we must defeat NAFTA;  • second, we must cancel the Canada-  US deal;  • and third, we must re-examine the  constitutionalarrangementgoverninghealth  care.  I have also come to believe that we  cannot protect and improve medicare unless  the Americans and Mexicans successfully  reform their own health care systems. We  are building alliances with Americans and  Mexicans over our common concerns about  free trade. We must work through these  alliances to defeat NAFTA and develop a  common alternative agenda in the health  care sector.

Couples,  Family and Group  Therapy  MARCH 1993 Feature  A 19-year old herstory:  India Mahila Association  by Manisha Singh  The women would cook and chat in the  kitchen, while the men argued politics in the  living room. Balancing a crying child on one  hip, making the family meal with the other,  my mother, huffingand sweating, struggled  to get in her worth. Talk, talk, talk... Never  interested in their life cycles, their spin cycles, I sat at the kitchen table, winding my  hair in and out of my fingers. Now, travelling through time, discovering and recovering myself, root by root, I want to sit at my  mother's table again and listen to the women's stories, and understand their silences.  It was this desire to sit at my mother's  table and listen to woman-talk that brought  me to the India Mahila Association (IMA), to  a group of South Asian women in Vancouver who have been politically organizing  against sexism and racism for the last two  decades.  In opposing domination, both white  and male, these courageous women have  pioneered important pathways for their  sisters and daughters to follow. We have to  know and honour this history. As a young  South Asian woman, as a community activist, I stand on the foundation they have built.  It is because of these women, my mothers,  that I stand and speak at all.  The, IMA is a Vancouver-based volunteer, grassroots political organization of and  for women whose origins lie in the Indian  subcontinent, and who come from India,  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Fiji,  Africa, the Caribbean and Europe. It is an  entirely volunteer-based group that continues to operate out of the members' houses to  this day. The IMA has never seen itself  as a ."helping-others" organization alone.  Raminder Dosanjh says that many of the  Premchit Siripawa  IMA women "have grown through our work  and dealt with our own entrenched stereotypes of women in our families, even as  we've been helping others."

(604)291-9119  President  Bernice Kirk  Secretary -Treasure  Colleen Jordan  CUPESB.C  Since its inception in 1973, the IMA has  attempted to challenge traditions and institutions which perpetuate and maintain the  oppression of South Asian women. They  have worked primarily to raise public awareness around issues such as violence against  women, the rights of South Asian women in  the labour force, cultural conflict between  mothers and daughters, immigration, and  new reproductive technologies.  In the late 1960s, the Canadian government liberalized immigration laws. South  Asian women arrived on the West Coast in  large numbers for the first time. It was the  rigours of the immigrant experience, the  burdens of their lives as women and exclusion from male-dominated community organizations and a white dominated women's movement whichfirstbroughtRaminder  Dosanjh, Harjit Dhillon and Premchit  Sripawa together in 1972.  These founding mothers began exchanging their ideas and started talking about  creating an organization for South Asian  women-an organization which, to begin  with, would give women the opportunity to  gather and talk. Together, they believed,  women could decide what must change and  how.  Despite the social and economic barriers these bold women were eager to challenge the old boys'—and old girls'—networks. Aware of the value and necessity of  women's support, they believed that in coming together they could empower one an  other to work for social change. After many  discussions, Dosanjh, Dhillon and Sripawa  created the India Mahila Association-the  first South Asian women's organization in  North America.  Are we responsible to  feminism with its racist  sympathies and  stereotypes, or are we  responsible to the South  Asian community and its  misogyny?  As Dosanjh remembers, "the three of us  sat down to talk. We tried to call a meeting  but nobody showed up. We talked to some  of our individual friends and asked them to  come. We got some women coming. We had  eight to ten members for a long time...we  decided that we would work from then on to  have an organized voice, to identify the issues, share our skills with each other, and  help each other cope with the sexism and  racism we were facing."  While the male establishment was silent  on the dominant issues concerning South  Asian women, they were vociferous in their  name calling.

The  women, however, believed that "they were  standing for their community, not against  it," says Dhillon.  While the community—both men and  women—came together to fight racism,  women were left to deal with the sexism.  The IMA opened up a dialogue within  the community about the issues concerning  South Asian women.  Because we live in a racist society, when  women from a particular community take  up the fight against sexism within that community, we find ourselves walking a tightrope. Our loyalties are questioned. Are we  responsible to feminism with its racist sympathies and stereotypes, or are we responsible to the South Asian community and its  misogyny? The women in the IMA have  juggled these responsibilities and have  proved that, in the end, we have to be responsible to ourselves—as South Asian  women.  In its early years, the IMA focused on  helping newly-arrived immigrant women  familiarize themselves with Canadian society. The IMA women would take new immigrant women on field trips around the city,  drive them to language training classes, show  them how to get around in shopping centres  and so on. Through all of this, women were  able to support one another in keeping cultural traditions alive. IMA organized a dance  group, which not only helped preserve and  protect cultural identity, but also brought  Balinder Johal and Harminder Sanghera at an IMA annual family dinner  of attitudes? How do you get the people to  accept these women as equals? So we decided that these women should chair the  meetings and challenge the community."  By the late 1970s, the IMA women felt  the need to publicly address the issue of  violence against women in the community.  There had been a series of suicides and  1981 demonstration against sex selection  ,:      .:  more women into the organization. By now,  the size of the organization had increased  dramatically.  The IMA had its first public meeting on  International Women's Day. Women focused  on a number of pressing issues and the  meetingwas strategically chaired by divorced  women-the women who had been ostracized by the community. As Dosanjh explains, "when a woman separates from her  husband, it's a big deal. She is labelled,  looked down upon, and isolated by the community. So how do you change these kinds  murders in the community—women were  committing suicide and women were being  murdered. Then, on the evening of June 11,  1981, Ravinder Johal was murdered by her  husband in public. A crowd of about 200  people gathered to listen to the cries of a  woman being crushed under the heavy tires  of her husband's vehicle. Some threw bricks,  while others watched silently. But the IMA  women spoke out.  This incident, and other less visible violent crimes against women prompted the  IMA women to organize a public meeting on  wm  ^ / Bra  Breads Bakery  Happy International  Women's Day  COOKIES AVAILABLE  February 27 - March 8  1697 Venables at Commercial 254-5635  Mon-Fri 8am-5:30pm  Sat 9am-5:30pm  the issue of violence against women. It was  the first time that South Asian women in  Vancouver took a public stand against male  violence in the community. As a result of the  meeting, numerous attempts were made to  ensure that programs were put in place that  would work towards eradicating violence  against women.  Speaking out against women's oppression by challenging male authority usually  means taking great risks. On February 9,  1980, IMA treasurer Nashater Dhahan was  murdered onher way home fromher shift as  a taxi driver. The IMA organized a public  memorial to ensure community recognition  of Dhahan's work and bravery in standing  up for the rights of women and farmworkers.  To date, no one has been convicted of the  crime.  Women who do this work today are  very brave. But for the women who first  spoke out, the risks were very high. However, as Nashter herself said at a rally on  International Women's Day in 1979, "it's not  just for myself. It's for all women including  myself that I fight."  In the early 80s, IMA reorganized themselves into four separate committees. A  victims' support group was set up to provide battered women with advocacy and  emotional support. Since the women always  had to rely on their own resources to raise  South Asian women's concerns, the IMA  used their personal phone lines as crisis  lines.  Meanwhile, women in the education  committee continued working towards raising community awareness, using various  means to communicate with thepublic. They  appeared on television and radio, and published a column in the Vancouver South  Asian community newspapers, The Link and  The Indo-Canadian Times.  "Our work in the media enabled us to  provide strength and support to women as  well as to reach out to various women in  their homes, some of whom would call us  months or a year after they had watched the  program," Dosanjh remembers.  The social committee planned dinners  and picnics, whichbroughtwomenand their  families together in celebration. And the  women in the Cultural committee worked  towards maintaining the unifying traditions  of South Asian culture. These traditions inspired women in their courageous struggles  against sexism and racism. "Weare proud of  our heritage, and our culture gives us  strength. That is why we try to keep as many  of our positive cultural traditions alive,"  says Dosanjh.  It was also a time when the IMA started  forging links with transition houses and service agencies across BC, to make them accessible to South Asian women by providing  cultural interpretation, disseminating infor  mation among women in the community,  and holding training workshops for shelter  workers.  This process was made easier by  younger South Asian women, such as Prabha  Khosla, Meera Gupta and Punam Khosla,  who joined the IMA around the mid 70s and  early 80s. These women were involved in the  broader women's movement and came to  the IMA to "sit around the kitchen table with  their 'mothers'." Dosanjh remembers that,  initially, Khosla and the other younger  women could not see eye to eye on political  strategy. While the two generations of women  shared similar goals, they could not agree on  how to arrive at their destination. After many  heated discussions, mothers and daughters  found ways to work together and gained  from sharing with one another.  Over the years, the IMA women have  continued to raise South Asian women's  concerns in the community. They have struggled tirelessly to change social and community attitudes. One of their most recent battles has been around the issue of sex selection. In 1991, the IMA women came out  strongly against a doctor from the US who  targeted the South Asian community newspaper for services at a Blaine, Washington  clinic, which used techniques to determine  the sex of a fetus, which often led to the  abortion of female fetuses. IMA condemned  his practices and challenged the community  to follow suit in order to prevent the doctor  from promoting sexism in the South Asian  community.  Most recently, the IMA has been working on a needs assessment project to find out  what South Asian women's needs are, and  determine whether social service agencies  are meeting those needs. The study is due to  be released in the next couple of months.  1983 IMA annual family dinner  It is the determination and courage of  women in the IMA which has given other  South Asian women the inspiration to begin  new organizations, to take on new challenge, and to continue working for the betterment of women's lives. Since the birth of  the IMA, a number of South Asian women's  organizations have been created around the  country, such as in the South Asian Women's Community Centre in Montreal and the  South Asian Women's Group in Toronto, to  name a few. And in Vancouver, the recently  established SAWAN (South Asian Women's Action Network) is working towards  setting up a South Asian Women's centre.  If you were to talk to some of the women  in the IMA today, you might be struck by  their humility as much as by their determination. Butasa younger South Asian woman,  I believe that, without the work the women  of the IMA did, South Asian women would  not have the political voice we have today.

MARCH 1993 1*1  Canada  adopts the j  definition off  refugee  found in til  UN Convention  Relating to the  Status of  Refugees:  "...[someone]!  who has a  well-founded ■  fear of  persecution for  reason of  race,  religion, I  nationality,  or membership  in a particular j  social group  or political  opinion..."  Conspicuously,!  this list  provides  no protectic  from persecutii  on the basis1  of gender  or sexual  orientation.  NEW   Il\/lMIGRATION  by Sunera Thobani  At the beginning of February, even as the Minister of Immigration was announcing the  much welcomed ruling on the case of "Nada," the infamous new Immigration Act (Bill C-  86) came into effect.  Nada (not her real name) is a woman from Saudi Arabia who applied for asylum in  Canada. Fearing for her safety—indeed for her life—if she was sent back to Saudi Arabia,  Nada cited persecution on the basis of her gender.  Persecution on the basis of gender is not officially recognized as the basis for claiming  refugee status, so the minister's favourable decision in allowing Nada to remain in Canada  was considered a major step forward in the struggle to define sex based persecution as the  basis for refugee claims.  However, the encouragement this ruling offered was short lived. There are a number of  other women who have applied for refugee status on similar grounds as Nada, and their  cases have yet to be favourably ruled upon. In addition, even as the minister was offering  some official recognition of the oppression and persecution of women with one hand, he was  undermining this recognition by taking away the rights of working immigrant women with  his other hand.  The new immigration act severely restricts immigration into Canada under both the  family sponsorship and refugee classes. By extending the powers of Immigration officers,  taking away the right of appeal of refugee claimants, reducing the family class, this  legislation will go down in Canadian history as one of the more inhuman pieces of legislation  introduced by a government which has already earned itself an unprecedented level of  unpopularity.  From Germany to North America, immigrant communities are paying the price for the  "new" world order, as racially motivated violence against immigrants is on the rise. Like  Germany, the Canadian government has chosen to restrict immigration of people of colour  into the country, rather than to deal with the racism which fuels attacks on people of colour  and feeds the paranoia that immigrants are "swamping" the country.  Through the 1960s, Canada needed skilled labour and turned to Europe, the US and, to  a lesser extent, underdeveloped countries for skilled workers. As a result of the changing  nature of the Canadian economy, the 1970s saw an increasing need for unskilled, cheap  labour. Canada turned to the underdeveloped countries, as did Europeand theUnited States,  "importing" immigrants who became the source of this cheap labour.  The most exploited and vulnerable of these workers were immigrant women of colour.  With severely restricted access to language and job training programs, immigrant women of  colour have historically been concentrated on the bottom rungs of the race and gender  segregated workforce.  Instead of being acknowledged and respected for the vital contributions they make to  Canadian society and to the economy, immigrant women become the first targets of both  mainstream racism and the Conservative government.  For although the State does not officially recognize immigrant women from the  underdeveloped countries as workers—choosing instead to primarily define them as  beneficiaries of Canada's "humane" immigration policies under the "family sponsorship"  and "refugee" classes—these women have a higher labour force participation rate than do  women born in Canada. On average, they are part of the labour force within three months  after arrival.  Yet, it is primarily immigrant women of colour whose opportunities for immigrating  into Canada will be greatly reduced by the drastic restrictions on fa mily, domestic labour and  refugee class immigrants. Working class immigrant families will be unable to sponsor any  except those family members who make up the nuclear family as defined by the "family  values" mob.  This new immigration act also needs to be understood within the context of the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Serving the interests of capital, the corporate  agenda that the present government is committed to imposing upon all of us aims to reduce  the rights of all working peoples. As the job losses directly related to NAFTA run into  hundreds of thousands, as corporations move in search of ever cheaper labour and even  greater profit, the new act is part of this attack on working peoples.  The federal government intends to cut down on "importing" cheap labour and will  instead stand back and watch as more job losses take place. Encouraging immigration by  professionals and the entrepreneurial class serves the corporate agenda, at the expense of  working class immigrants and their families, who will pay the cost of this "re-structuring",  j  Historically unprecedented levels of poverty and starvation compel people from the  underdeveloped world to seek to migrate to Europe and North America. These peoples  continue to leave their countries of origin in order to survive, and in search of employment  and better living conditions for themselves and their families. Some come to North America  fleeing political and social conditions prevailing in their home countries. Many more are  fleeing the economic havoc being wreaked across the globe by the United States and its ever  willing crony, the Mulroney government. However, all immigrants share one thing in  common. And that is the dream of a better future, a secure future.  In February 1993, those dreams have been dealt a bitter blow by the federal government.  The fight against the new Immigration Act cannot be separated from the fight against  escalating racism in the country, and against NAFTA. Coalitions across the country are  committed to ending the reign of the present federal government. Serving the interest of  corporations, which is the motivating force behind current federal policies, has to be replaced  with the interests of people. It is only a commitment to the interests of people which will take  us in a progressive direction in this period of major global upheaval.

At the same time, it introduces measures that restrict the rights of immigrants  to freedom of association, to family reunification, and to access to services in Canada.  About 35,000 people annually apply for refugee status from within Canada. Before the  passage of the new Immigration Act, most were granted it. The new law will allow  immigration officials to turn away up to 40 percent of these people from our borders.  What the Canadian government wants refugees to do is stay home—or in refugee camps  close to home—and apply for refugee status from outside Canada. The official Canadian  position is that refugees—a target group of 7,500 in 1991, for instance—should be selected  by visa officers abroad, or privately sponsored by church or other charitable organizations.  People who apply from abroad have to convince a visa officer that they qualify as refugees  under the UN definition [see left], and that they can establish themselves in Canada. The  process screens out the uneducated, the sick, the elderly, and, especially, women and  children.  Visa requirements discriminate against women in a number of categories. Women are  less likely to be admitted to Canada as students, as visitors, or as independent immigrants,  because of their relative lack of education, of wealth, or of specialized job skills. Some of the  job skills they are expected to have—"feminine" skills as caregivers—have led to the  Women are less likely to be admitted to Canada as  students, as visitors, or as independent  immigrants, because of their relative lack of  education, of wealth, or of specialized job skills.  establishment of a separate category of immigration, wherein women are required to work  in Canada for at least two years as live-in caregivers in order to earn an opportunity to apply  for permanent resident status. The qualifying requirements for this program have been  raised to levels of education and training that eliminate most women from the "third world."  The following is a list highlighting aspects of the new Immigration Act compiled from  Immigration department documents, press releases and coverage, and other sources. There  has been insufficient time to fully examine the implications of the legislation for women  immigrants and refugees and, as such, this report is preliminary. Kinesis will follow up with  more information in the coming months.  What's in it for refugees:  • Senior immigration officers at points of entry into Canada are given the power to  unilaterally determine the legitimacy of a would-be refugee's claim. There need be no formal  hearing, just an interview on entry with a single immigration officer. This takes the place of  the former "credible basis hearing" with two or three independent members of the  Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB).  • Legitimate refugees who passed through a "safe haven"—a third country where they  could have applied for refugee status before reaching Canada—will be refused entry on  those grounds.  • Immigration department press releases state that the government will seek to make an  agreement with the US similar to the European Community's "country of first asylum"  agreement, which requires people to claim refugee status in the first country they enter upon  leaving home. Canadian immigration sources estimate that such an agreement with the US  would remove about one third of the refugee stream. Treatment of these refugee claimants  by the US is likely to differ substantially from that by Canada. For instance, US acceptance  rates for refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala average less than 10 percent as opposed  to Canadian acceptance rates of over 80 percent.  • Airlines must refuse to transport undocumented travellers or face fines of up to $50,000  per passenger.  • Refugee claimants will be fingerprinted and photographed on entry. Fingerprint files  are to be destroyed after the granting of Canadian citizenship, if it occurs. The legislation also  provides for the circulation of photo or fingerprint files to provincial or municipal authorities.  • Immigration officers will now have the right to conduct searches at ports of entry.  ■ Would-be refugees rejected at the initial interview will be turned away immediately if  they have passed through a "safe haven" or a country with which Canada has made an  agreement. In most other cases, however, the claimant is given seven days to hire a lawyer.  ■ Would-be refugees rejected at an IRB hearing can appeal for judicial review on strictly  legal grounds within seven days? In some cases, they will be removed from Canada pending  the outcome of the appeal.  • Refugees who arrive inCanada without "satisfactory identification"—or refugees from  countries considered "non-refugee-producing"—will now require unanimous acceptance  in their IRB hearings, instead of acceptance by at least one IRB officer (of two or three), as was  previously the case.  • Refugee claimants will not receive work permits (employment authorizations) until  their claims have been accepted. People whose claims have been rejected under the old  legislation and who have been working pending their appeals now lose the right to continue  to work while they appeal.  What's in it for would-be immigrants  • Except in the case of family reunification, strict quotas (numerical limitations) apply;  that is, otherwise qualified applicants can be refused because the quotas in that category have  been met.  • Some immigrants can be forced to settle in areas outside of Vancouver, Montreal, or  Toronto, for at least the first two years.  • Terms and conditions of work can be imposed on immigrants. For instance, women  who apply for permanent resident status as live-in caregivers are required to successfully  apply for work permits, to obtain live-in employment, and to complete a total of two years  of employment in a three-year period.  ■ Immigrants can be excluded for security reasons: for having a criminal record for an  offence considered a crime in both Canada and in the country of origin; for past or present  membership in an organization involved in criminal activities, in Canada or abroad, whether  or not the individual immigrant has been convicted of any crime.  What's in it for inland immigrants  • The "security clause" can be used retroactively to deport landed immigrants who  belong to a group in Canada or in their country of origin that used violent or illegal activity  as part of political protest.  • The new legislation provides for the "removal" from Canada of people on welfare. It  is unclear how this provision applies to refugees awaiting work permits, or women who  break up with spouses who supported them.  • New regulations have narrowed the definition of dependants who can be sponsored  under the family reunification process. It is estimated that the new definition will eliminate  about 20,000 people a year. For example, if a woman came from a country where unmarried  women are expected to live with their parents, under the old law, she could have been  sponsored as a dependent, regardless of age. Under the new Immigration Act, she would  only be considered a dependent if she were unmarried and under 19 years of age, or a full-  time students or disabled.  Would-be refugees rejected at the initial interview  will be turned away immediately if they have     \  passed through a "safe haven" or a country with  which Canada has made an agreement.  What's in it for landed immigrants  Companion legislation (the Immigrant Language Training Policy, made up of LINC  (Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada) and LMLT (Labour Market Language  Training) provides that:  • As soon as landed immigrants become Canadian citizens (after three years), they are  no longer eligible for language instruction. These changes put the focus on time spent in  Canada rather than language needs and they primarily disqualify women, who usually do  not seek language training in the first few years because of family responsibilities.  • The training allowance for language instruction is discontinued. Very little childcare—  and no childcare allowance—is provided to people in language instruction.  • Language training periods are short—people are cut off at very basic levels of  competency.  ■ Job-related language training is restricted to high-demand employment only. 5i  Winnifred Tovey is a regular contributor to Kinesis.

FEDERATION  OF LABOUR  (CLC)  MARCH 1993 Arts  Review: Lai See Soo Sang  Fast life on a lazy susan  by Laiwan   FAST LIFE ON A LAZY SUSAN  Collaboratively produced and performed  by Lai See Soo Sang  at the Women In View Festival,  Directed by Mercedes Baines  A large video screen flickers on the  darkened stage. Black-white-blue toned images appear with an unobtrusive soundtrack, the unseen camera in motion absorbing images in a blurred, slow motion movement of women eating, talking, bonding—it  suddenly dawns on me that the camera is  perched on the lazy-susan in the centre of the  circular table capturing life from the viewpoint of the food and its containers.  Fast Life on a Lazy Susan is a humourous,  passionatesliceoflifeintheCanadian'multi-  cultural' diaspora, at once empowering and  critical of both western and eastern constructions of identity. Using a combination  of taiko drumming, theatre, dance, comedy,  video, script writing, storytelling, the women  who make up Lai See Soo Sang—Wai Gein,  River Sui, Leslie Komori and Jenny Lo—  have produced a highly-accessible examination of the complex internal struggles of  many East Asian Canadian women.  After the video intro, the performance  begins with a powerful taiko set where the  viewer is witness to the strength, vigour and  bond of three women drumming on stage.  The taiko drumming has a cathartic effect  that clears the brain and moves the passions  to the gut, leaving us free to celebrate the  sheer joy of the repetitive, meditative rhythms  and the joy of seeing women, women of  colour, ta pping into various a rtforms to sha re  their passions and concerns with us.  As the drumming continues, we see the  women interact in well-practiced non-western rhythms. The comic tone of the performance revolves around the theme of food and  its accompanying rituals in Asian cultures.  The three women start to rotate and exchange drums while still playing and picking up snacks and sushi from a bowl in the  center. This is done alternately with bare  hands and taiko drumsticks used as chopsticks.  The audience's warm laughter evoked  by this scene stems from the joy of seeing the  simple chopstick brought to a symbolic level  by the use of the clunky taiko drumsticks to  pick up and eat food—celebrating the deftness of the human hand and mobility. A  chopstick as a functional tool has a very  different logic in its invention as compared  to a knife and fork. The economical design,  tflacLeod'i  USE0& OLD  900KS  QOUC-WT <£ SOLO  HAPPY  INTERNATIONAL  WOMEN'S  t55 WEST PENDER  VANCOUVER  PHONE   681-7654-  its practicality, the ease in transportation  and its link to how Asian foods are prepared  and eaten are celebrated in this simple scene.  It is this logic that is celebrated in Fast  Life.  The scene then shifts to an Asian restau-  rant table where the three order Asian  East Asian Canadians face as children and as  adults.  In the strongest sequence, Wai Gein describes her decision to take up tap dancing  over Chinese classes because of her bond  withher father in enjoying Hollywood musicals.  Converging chopsticks in Fast Life on a Lazy Susan  ... Lai See Soo Sang— have produced a highly-  accessible examination of the complex internal  struggles of many East Asian Canadian women.  and hybrid Asian-Canadian food—chicken  chow-mein sandwich on wonderbread with  butter; kappa maki; Ngow-yuk broccoli,  etc.—from a Cantonese-speaking waitress.  The fusion of Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin and English languages in the ordering of  the 'hybrid' meal signifies a Canadian 'multiculturalism' in 'practice.' Fast Life makes  fun of the absurdity and impracticality of  such a notion, while at the same time, questions the essentialism, or fixed notion, of a  traditional "correctness."  The bonding that occurs around the  dinner table between the women, and their  ensuing relationship with the waitress, become more developed in the following  dream sequences, where each woman performs a monologue with improvised dance/  performance/action to illustrate or emphasize the words spoken.  These sequences are humourous and  s, illustrating the complex struggles  "I didn't like being called 'chink,' or  'ricer,' or 'slant-eyed Chinaman.' I could  never figure out what to say to someone after  they called me that," she says, as she dances  an angry and frustrated tap. "Now I realize  how much of a culture is learnt through  language. I think and interpret in English. I  know I'm missing the Chinese logic that goes  along with speaking and writing Chinese."  The anger of the words merging with the  tap dance is especially moving and convincing in this sequence. The angry tap dance  becomes Wai Gein's empowering response  to the alienated place where she has been  positioned by a racist society. Through a  skillful weaving of passions and humour,  the absurdity of cultural expectations that  are oppressive, racism and 'cross-cultural'  hybridization is soulfully presented.  The other individual pieces by the  women are also insightful. Especially funny  is River Sui as a Bruce-Lee wanna-be.

Sui's  play on Bruce Lee sabotages the machismo  of kung-fu stereotypes, and yet acknowledges the influence of Lee as an icon on an  international scale.  Komori is a "yancha bozu"—meaning  a total terror—who is addicted to Saturday  cartoons and is forced to go to "odori" lessons, to prepare her to perform as a "polite  Japanese girl" for Multicultural Day. Dressed  in a tightly-obi-bound kimono, Komori highlights the absurdity of the clash between so-  called feminity and who Komori's character  wants to be, as well as the clash between  private realities and public stereotypes expected in a "multicultural" context.  Perhaps the weakest sequence is the  waitress' monologue performed by Lo. The  stereotypes she presents for questioning are  more familiar and predictable. She stands,  presenting a monologue without any of the  elements of performance that make the other  pieces lively. It is a more socio-realist-docu-  mentary style which felt incongruent to the  other dream sequences.  Many Chinese waitresses I know tend  to be immigrants, have no options for furthering their education, let alone time for  ESL classes, and are restricted in socio-mo-  bility by low wages. This is contrary to the  image of the empowered waitress in Fast Life  who is studying to become a lawyer. I guess  the possibility of a profession for Asian waitresses must always be made visible and  addressed, but the class improbabilities of  this sequence and our social realities makes  this monologue less successful.  Many joys came out for me inFast Life's  celebration of the numerous rituals—from  ea ting, to fighting over who pays the restaurant cheque, to the curse of not finishing  your rice in your bowl meaning you will  have a pock-faced husband as a result, to  always serving food in a forward motion,  never backhand, as this would mean you  might treat the person you are serving in a  backhanded way.  Together, they reminded me of how,  despite our various levels of assimilation,  appropriation, and oppression in a Canadian 'multicultural' construct, we survive  and build our identities, not in isolation, but  with a commonality that is binding.  Fast Life on a Lazy Susan makes me look  at what is on my plate—yes, much food for  thought, from a celebration of eating to surviving as an East-Asian woman in the Canadian milieu.

ESCAPE  Performed by Barabara Stowe  and Gerardo Avila  Take Barbara Stowe's Escape, seen last  September at the Dancing on the Edge festival in Vancouver, which had been developed and was now called theatre, not dance.  Escape, however, was still an autobiographical work about a dancer's journey through  cancer, and the dancing in it, albeit brief, was  important. The opening monologue at the  ballet barre, the bits of home movie dancing,  and the clumsy waltz with the boyfriend,  were all so telling that I want to keep claiming the work for the dance world. The final  dance of triumph was the only part that  seemed tacked on and a little unconvincing;  hopefully that's still to come as the work is  further developed.  WithcollaboratorGerardoAvila,Stowe  also uses film, puppetry, magic, mime,  monologue and dialogue, so I guess theatre  is the best all-encompassing term. A long list  of disciplines is sometimes more impressive  than the actual work, but Escape exploits its  range of technique to powerfully flit between comedy and tragedy.  (ONE, TWO) BUCKLE MY SHOE  Choreographed and performed  by Barbara Bourget, Desiree Kleemann  and Kay Huang  Sets by Leah Decter  Collaborative productions are definitely  the current artistic wave and another one  that soared was (One Two) Buckle My Shoe by  choreographer/dancers Barbara Bourget,  KayHuang and Desiree Kleemann and visual  artist Leah Decter.  Actually, after going home and thinking about the performance, I began to doubt  the intensity of the euphoria I'd experienced  watching it. What was my reaction based  on? I mean, there was Huang's opening  Ophelia, with her child-like singing and  guilty thighs—and even a suicide over those  thighs, or over men, or something silly like  that; there was Kleemann, in part two, slowly  removing five layers of beautiful nostalgic-  looking dresses to a loud Country and Western song; there was Bourget's long traverse  of the stage in the final third, white-painted  and on her knees, her extravagantly filmy  tutu concealing the effort, while her arms  spoke^-well, they really told tales of ballet  and life and desire and defeat and life again.  But not enough seemed to have happened to  account for the incredible excitement I'd felt  long after leaving the theatre.  The set I never doubted. Decter's suspended bed-cum-door, bursting with creamy  lace, was a wonderful metaphor - the bed  where we lie, and sometimes tell lies, and are  sometimes lied to; the doorway to adult,  Alana Shewchuk in Dream Rite and Mouvement  sexual identity. For Huang's adolescent cha r-  acter, it became a cradle, a swing; for  Kleemann, pregnant and dancing about it, it  was the place where new identities (dresses  again) were found.  But there should have been more movement, I told myself, beyond Huang's couple  of developes, Kleemann's hands on her belly  and Bourget's arms. A lot of my response  must have just come from the loud enveloping music. So I went back a second time.  There's nothing like the first time, of course,  but if the thrill of the unexpected was gone,  the euphoria was still there.  To enjoy Buckle My Shoe, you probably  have to like the ambiguity of poetry, or  paintings—the kind you can look at once  and then go visit every time you're in the  neighbourhood. With such a minimum of  action, the piece was a little like a tableau  vivant (a living slate), and one looked for a  long time at almost the same, only slowly  changing image.  But, by the end, when Bourget inched  across the stage, the picture had acquired  layers of meaning: we'd 'read' the scarlet  scrawl of Huang sprawled at the back of the  stage; Kleemann sitting in profile in the middle ground, waiting; the pile of discarded  dresses /identities; the black plastic flowers  littering the stage.  The stories had been told, filling the  stage with accumulated resonances—the  artists' and our own.  Buckle My Shoe struck a precise balance  between the dance, the set, the costumes (the  combined colours and textures were as heady  as strong perfume), the songs, and the music: magic in an intangible sense.  M'LADY TEAR DROPS  Choreographed by Chick Snipper  Danced by Nicole Duke, Tara Friedenberg,  Jennifer Harwood, Phoebe Newsted and  Jennifer Simpkin  DREAM RITE AND MOUVEMENT  Written by Rachel Browne  Performed by Julia Drymala, Sharon  Moore, Carol Prieur, Alana Shewchuk and  Julia Zohrab  Music composed by Diana Mcintosh  Other dance performances embodied  their own forms of magic. There was pure  movement in Chick Snipper's M'Lady Tear  Drops and in Rachel Browne's Dream Rite  and Mouvement. Despite a programme note  explaining that parts of Mouvemen t 'refer to'  a Frida Kahlo painting, for me the work  wasn'tabout the Kahlo paintingldon'tknow  but about Rachel Browne, the choreographer, whose work I admire but somehow  never get close to. Feet and hands had a life  of theirown, takingdancer Alana Shewchuk  where they would, against the rhythm or  feeling of the music, against where I expected or wanted them to go.  Art doesn't always make sense, and it  doesn't always make the intended sense. For  this viewer, Mouvemen t worked as an exploration of why Browne makes the dances she  does and as such it was gripping.  Kaija Pepper is a volunteer Kinesis writer.  Review: Dying to be Thin  A day in the life  by T. Gibson  DYING TO BE THIN  Produced by Carousel Theatre  Directed by Pam Johnson  Linda Carson's Dying to be Thin is an all-  too-real description of a day in the life,  thoughts and feelings of a bulimic. Directed  by Pam Johnson, this one-act play, starring  Carson as Amanda, is so poignant in its  portrayal of the severe emotional extremes  of such an experience, that even moments  that were borderline funny could not make  me laugh. Its glaring accuracy—which is  what makes this play a tremendous success—made me wonder what anyone in the  audience could possibly see as funny.  The scene opens on a cozy set. Amanda  is asleep in her canopy bed. A table, dresser  and mirror surround her and, to the right is  the all-important bathroom. Everything looks  "normal"—only the bathroom scale, a note  on the wall with a written vow to lose ten  pounds, and a very thin main character, give  any hint of something wrong.  Minutes into the opening, to the sound  of food lists being chanted in the background—"sugar, chocolate, icing, bread,  cake," and so on—the audience is witness to  Amanda's first purge. The scene is handled  with creativity and is effective, yet there is  something almost too "pretty" to make an  impact on the non-bulimic.  Throughout the play, however, emotions are captured perfectly. In a frighteningly short time, we travel with Amanda  through her post-purging euphoria—a "new  beginning" of 800 calories a day; panic at her  "slim" sister's upcoming visit—triggering a  resolution to cut down to zero calories for  one week; terror—of approaching her mother's gift of rice cakes; and excitement—of  going on a "binge to end all binges."  I actually felt her emotional free-fall. I  tingled at the thought of her accomplishing  her goals—no matter how sadly misguided—  and felt a heaviness settle in as "blowing it"  created an empty "success journal." And,  finally, I experienced a few moments of  outright despair—when she recounts the  story of how her intimacy with bathrooms'  finds her one day, when she is trapped in a  grubby washroom down a dark alley in  Toronto.  As I watched all of this, I couldn't help  but remember an exchange between a therapist and my bulimic friend at a therapy  Linda Carson in Dying to Be Thin  group. So tormented was she by society's  billion dollar "fat" industry—geared at mak  ing women ashamed of themselves—that  where we saw frailty, she saw bloating.  Knowing that recovery is multi-layered  and complex, the therapist gently instilled a  watchful voice inside my friend: "I love and  accept myself. Binging and purging is doing  harm to me."  Her surprise at hearing that her "ultimate release" or binge was actually doing  awful things to her body, struck me hard. So  did the list of the damage that bulimia can  do—chronic fatigue and illness, worn tooth  enamel, electrolyte imbalance, kidney damage, gastro-intestinal problems, irregular  menstrual periods, as well as lost time at  school, work and with friends.  Dying to be Thin is an incredible production. Its detail is meticulous and I was tremendously impressed by Carson. She ac-  >. knowledges being a recovering bulimic,  o   knowing full well how identification with  .2   an issue can sometimes spur undesirable  effects. Yet in not hiding, but instead illustrating the downward spiral of a condition  that once seemed "magical", she gives back  to sufferers of bulimia compassion, dignity,  and a lessening of shame.

Vancouver and writes  16  MARCH 1993 Arts  Book Review: All Names Spoken  Words for the unspoken  by Larissa Lai   ALL NAMES SPOKEN:  POETRY AND PROSE  by Tamai Kobayashi and  Mona Oikawa  Sister Vision Press, 1992  The first time I heard Mona Oikawa  read at a conference in Ontario, I cried. She  was reading "Coming Out at the Sushi Bar."  It was as though someone had held a mirror  up to my soul. The intensity of the reflection  was blinding. It's a simple poem, about  coming out as a lesbian to a closely trusted  family member. Unlike the stories of families, in which mothers make noises of disgust and fathers hit the roof and yell "Get  out!" this story was different. This relative  calmly answers, "Yeah. So what?" and then  remarks on how the wasabi is hotter than  My mother says that Asian cultures are  "implicit," meaning that much is understood without ever being spoken. But the  emotions are different from those of white  people, and harder to explain because there  are no words for them, or so I thought. For  me, and other Asian North Americans, there  is an odd twist - part of me wants the fireworks, the yelling and the screaming: catharsis, and another part prefers to ride on  what is unsaid, but understood. But that  understanding is undermined by the desire  for fireworks.  "Coming Out at the Sushi Bar" is included in a new book of poetry and prose by  Tamai Kobayashi and Mona Oikawa called  All Names Spoken, published by Sister Vision  Press. Both writers give voice to those things  that I thought could only be understood  unspoken. They have found the words.  The book is divided into two sections  that complement each other: poetry pieces  by Kobayashi are followed by poetry and  prose pieces by Oikawa.  Tamai Kobayashi and Mona Oikawa  Theauthors,both "Japanese-Canadian,"  come from very different experiences.  Oikawa, a Sansei (third-generation), has  never been to Japan. Herfamilyhistoryis the  history of the internment camps in the interior of BC, to which Japanese Canadians  were forcibly sent during the Second World  War. Kobayashi, on the other hand, immigrated well after the war. Her first language  is Japanese.  Her prose piece, "Excerpt from a Work  in Progress," although fiction, explores precisely that difference. The historical relationship between the characters Kathy and Zen  parallels that which exists between the two  authors (except Kobayashi and Oikawa are  not lovers.)  The character, Kathy, a young lesbian  sansei, brings her Japanese born lover, Zen,  home with her to Ottawa. She introduces  Zen as her roommate to her mother. As it  turns out, both Zen and the mother have had  similar experiences with their immigrant  fathers. In terms of immigration, Zen precedes Kathy by a generation. Kathy is disturbed by the comfort between her mother  and her lover that stems from this. At the  same time, the secret she must keep from her  mother about the true nature of the relationship with Zen gnaws away at her. These  three people who care about each other can  never be completely honest with each other.  It puts a strain on their day-to-day lives.  The strength of Kobayashi's poetry lies  in its appeal to the senses and to history.  Against a backdrop of taiko drumming, exile, Hiroshima, and the individual sufferings  of family members, a quiet beauty creeps  out, taking pleasure in the moment—watching a loved one breathe, seeing fireflies, or  making love.  Early in the book, the "poem for lola"  sets up the context:  you are Chinese  we are lesbians  and there has  never been  anything  as simple  as this.  Later, "memory, need and desire," a  poem about hot sex, echoes that simplicity.  It is descriptive, graphic...what does one  say?...hot! And new, because it's not just  about sex, but about Asian lesbian sex. (In  the preface, Kobayashi and Oikawa remark  that the number of books published by Asian  lesbians is sma 11, and they could count on the  fingers of one hand the number of books  authored by Japanese North American lesbians.)  Kobayashi tends to be vague at times. In  "Untitled," she decribes two photographs of  a child who has grown up and is now someone close to Kobayashi - it is not clear whether  she's a friend, lover or family member. She  Local writer Joanne Arnott was the 1992 winner of the Canadian League of Poets' Gerald  Lampert Award for her first book of poetry, Wiles of Girlhood.

One gets a sense of regret for something  lost. But that 'something' would perhaps  have meant more to me were it less elusive.  Her pain is the pain of an exile. I suspect the  vagueness stems from the loss of a language  and the ability to articulate her childhood,  which exists in that language, and which,  she has perhaps forgotten.  Oikawa's work in the second section  complements Kobayashi's. She too deals  with the relationships between aspects of  our family and erotic lives. In Asian cultures, we remain deeply a part of our families, even after childhood. Practical ties bind  us, but there are also ties that seem fleeting,  harder to name. These are touched upon in  many of both Oikawa's and Kobayashi's  works.  In "Self-Examination," Oikawa writes  about how she thinks of her mother, who  lost a breast to cancer, as she examines her  own breasts for lumps. She is caught in the  disturbing space between the memory of her  mother, and the memory of lovers who have  touched her breasts. She is both turned on  and filled with intense grief, at the same  time.  Oikawa's work speaks clearly of a committed Asian lesbian feminist politic. She  writes about the pain and difficulty of breaking up with a woman for whom she still  cares deeply. She writes about the excitement of being among other Asian lesbians at  the Asian/Pacifica Lesbian Network retreat  at Santa Cruz in 1989.  But if herworkispoliticaLit'snot merely  in an intellectual sense—it is deeply felt.  In her prose pieces, she takes pleasure in  eroticizing relationships among Asian  women. "Heartbeat" is a taiko romance;  "Stork Cools Wings" is about a love affair  that evolves from a Tai Chi class. These  contexts allow a sense of history to ride with  moments of pleasure which exist very much  in the present. In "Safer Sex in Santa Cruz,"  safer sex practices are made fun and funny  for Asian lesbians.  Kobayashi's work is primarily about  loss and exile. She writes about rebuilding  community, desire, and sexual practice.  Oikawa picks up these threads and flushes  them out, bringing to light the dilemmas,  contradictions and the beauty which con-'  stantly arise in trying to reconcile the va rious  parts of her own identity and of the identities  of people she cares about.

"Women's studies are in the kitchen."  These are some of the words of warning  from members of the male student body to  the fictitious Feminist Union at the University of Pacific Northwest, the setting for  Nora Kelly's latest crime-thriller My Sister's  Keeper.  Inthispage-turningmysterywithafemi-  nist twist, Vancouver writer Nora Kelly looks  at violence against women and sexism on  the university campus through her protagonist, Gillian Adams. A history professor at  home in the halls of academia, Adams, together with women from the Feminist Union, exposes the tacit acceptance of sexist  activities on Campus and puts a halt to the  engineeringfaculty'sannual"slaveparade."  As a result, Adams becomes embroiled  in numerous battles. She is confronted not  only by the engineering faculty, but by the  administration and even her best friend.  And then, of course, there's 'the murder'.  In the book, Kelly makes veiled references to 'pranks' by the engineering department at the University of British Columbia  (UBC), such as the established and widely  accepted Lady Godiva parade [where a sex  trade worker is hired to ride naked on a  horse through campus]. Women at UBC and  in Vancouver have long protested the sanctioned sexism of this event, a long-standing  annual tradition at the engineering school.  Until the Montreal massacre in 1990, the  UBC administration was "not energetic in  their efforts to end a public ritual that humiliates women," said Kelly, when I asked  her about it. As a result of the massacre, she  said, the public has begun to make the connection between misogynist behaviour and  violence against women.  WWAvl 433-3511  SPARTACUS  311 W.HASTINGS ST.  Vancouver    6886138  Feminist mystery writer Nora Kelly  In fact, Kelly says she was prompted by  the Montreal massacre to write feminist  crime-fiction. "I didn't want to write about  the incident itself, but the aftermath really  interested me in which the whole country  asked: "How could this happen?" I wanted  to write a book about how it could happen."  Kelly also enjoys writing about environments with strong, insular atmospheres,  such as university campuses, which, she  says, are fertile grounds for crime fiction.  In the novel, the administration is also  under scrutiny for its unwillingness to respond to allegations of sexism—which brings  to mind the reluctance of the Langara campus administration in Vancouver to act when  two male students threatened Langara student Kim Anda Jarzebiak with rape last  year.  It is woman-centredness that makes  Kelly's novel stand out from other female  mystery writers such as PD James, Agatha  Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers who, while  acknowledged experts of the genre, often  rely on "impossibly gifted male heroes to  solve the puzzles," said Kelly.

V7L 1B4  i Women owned & operated since 1984 j  In traditional crime-fiction when the  main character is female, she is often bound  by the constraints of a patriarchal structure—there is a rupture in the logical masculine order and the protagonist must intervene to restore that order by taking due  action.  Kelly's novel is a departure from the  logical order. There are no pat answers and  no simple issues in My Sister's Keeper. Feminist crime-fiction is a lively area, Kelly says,  and it is exciting to be part of changing the  genre into something new. "By creating a  female private eye, you challenge the perceived wisdom about what roles are appropriate for women and you can expose the  roots of violent behaviour by bringing in  untouched subject matter and exploring aspects of women's lives.  "I wanted to write about overt feminist  issues all around campus. I also wanted to  write a piece of crime-fiction in a way that  people who don't think in those terms would  be drawn [to]."  The novel is compelling reading and  easily read in a single lengthy sitting. Kelly  creates identifiable characters who stray from  the cardboard players often found in traditional crime novels. She has a fluid writing  style that keeps the plot moving and the  reader engrossed.  This applies to relationships as well.  Adams has a 12-year relationship with a  man that creates an interesting tension and  shows no signs of any resolution. "This is  more true to life," says Kelly. "They're working things their own way."  Kelly, who has a PhD in history, has  studied at both of Vancouver's major universities and has first-hand experience with  academic life. However, she says, any similarities between herself and Adams are  purely political. "The protagonist is not me,"  she says, "although we are the same age and  we obviously shareapoliticalpointof view."  The title, an appropriation of the biblical phrase 'my brother's keeper,' embodies  what feminism is all about for Kelly. "We are  all our sisters' keepers—we need to look out  for ourselves."  Kelly's next book, Bad Chemistry, focuses on a pregnancy testing clinic in Cambridge, where Kelly looks at women in the  sciences. When a female chemist and pregnancy testing group member is murdered,  Gillian Adams is back on the scene.

Love,  Kinesis  Not my zine  Kinesis:  I am writing to clarify my thoughts on  bisexuals and the new Zine. In the article  about the new publication for lesbians and  bisexual women of colour [see Kinesis,  Feb.93,] I am quoted as saying, "bisexuals  have access to privileges in relation to men,  and may take issue with concerns that lesbians of colour have, issues that bisexuals may  not want to deal with."  In response to whether or not I would be  interested in working on a new magazine for  lesbians and bisexual women of colour—I  stated thatl was not interested in working on  a magazine that included bisexuals—I personally feel that bisexual women have heterosexual privilege in their relationshipswith  men and I don't want to deal with their  issues and I don't want to deal with people  who can't fully understand mine. I'm at a  point in my life where I am only willing to  focus my energy into a lesbian only publication.  I also take issue with the pullout in the  article that says "the only lesbian of colour  publication in Vancouver." It should have  said: "the only lesbian and bisexual women of  colour publication in Vancouver."  With the new changes at Angles (i.e. the  inclusion of bisexuals), I feel that we no  longer have a gay and lesbian newspaper in  Vancouver. It seems that the gay and lesbian  community are politically correcting themselves right out of their own power.  From the response that I recieved from  dykes, lesbians and gay women since the  death of Diversity, I know that there is certainly room for a lesbian only publication in  this town.  I wish success to the lesbians & bisexual  women of Zine, because it will be a much  needed voice for many lesbians of colour—  but not for this lesbian of colour.  Sincerely,  Marlene Wong,  Former collective member,  Diversity: The Lesbian Rag  Vancouver, BC  What zine is  Kinesis:  The "Zine but not herd" article in your  last issue [see Kinesis, Feb. 93] raised some  important questions which compel us to  clarify what the zine is and who/what it  represents.  The zine was conceived as a tool to  explore how we, as lesbians and bisexual  women of colour, could link and work together in a non-ambitioning, non-competitive sense of collectivity. It was initiated  without any assumptions of "co-ordinator/  s" responsibility, but rather as a medium  that creates and moulds itself through collaboration. Our interest is in constructive  dialogue, criticism, expression, and the building of new models of working together in a  structure of division that we have inherited.  The zine's intent is to reach out to unlock that  which is unvoiced, silenced, oppressed—  to empower ourselves by identifying oppressions, internal and external, without hierarchy or correctness.  The low production values, the rough-  and-ready style characteristic of "zines," signify a choice that does not look for approval  or "value-laden" recognition, but one that  brings issues down to the commonest denominator—to say what we want to say,  how we want to say it, in our own space.  Pseudonyms and anonymity are encouraged to all contributors to keep Zine But  Not Herd free from individual ambitioning,  agendas, or vested interest in power struggle. Also, it is to encourage an opening of  dialogue without fear of retribution, and to  encourage the discussion of issues, which  may be risky or outlawed or silenced, among  us. It is especially to encourage keeping us  safe in this racist, homophobic, sexist and  class discriminating world.  All writings and images that reach us  written or drawn by lesbian and bisexual  women of colour will be printed in our zine.  Any writings or images that are malicious  with the intent to isolate individuals or  groups of women of colour will not be included. Submissions will not be edited or  changed, with the exception of enlargement  and reduction in size so as to fit the format.  Handwritten copy will be printed as given to  us unless specified otherwise.  The problems with the Kinesis article are  numerous. It presented a story abouta "publication"—a word loaded with many assumptions—"that is to represent lesbians of  colour,—the only lesbian of colour publication in Vancouver!"—thus placing emphasis on the zine as product rather than as  process.  At our first zine meeting, which Kinesis  writer Cynthia Low attended as a participant, the intent of exploring the process of  collaboration was made clear.  Further, to describe our zine in Kinesis  before it hit the street set up the zine with  assumptions of representation which didn't  have much to do with what we were working with. To raise bisexuality as an issue  among those attending the meetings is highly  problematic, especially since the zine as product had yet to be produced to convey its  angle and strategy for lesbian and bisexual  womenof colour solidarity. This isolatingof  issues that presents a hierarchy and labeling  of oppressions is not the intent or function of  the zine.  Zine But Not Herd is here to celebrate  and share whatlesbiansand bisexual women  of colour, as outlaws in a racist, mysogynist  world, are feeling outside of personal or  institutional agendas, politicking or ideology-  Further, the article set up the participants within the zine and onlookers, who  knew who was quoted in the article by its  focus on individual Black women, thus further setting up assumptions on who is involved in the zine and invisibilising the Asian,  South Asian, Arab and First Nations' women  involved.  Respectfully,  Laiwan and Lynne Wanyeki  Vancouver, BC  Racism at WIV  Kinesis:  The Worn en In View Festival's networking session "Let's Not Talk About Race Issues" on January 31 in Vancouver was attended by about 15 First Nations, African,  Chinese, Japanese, South Asian, Arab, and  mixed heritage women, many strangers to  each other, but all of us sitting in a tight,  welcoming and intimate circle. But we were  not abne.  Though the session was explicitly advertised in the festival program as a "discussion for Women of Colour," strangely that  seemed to include any white-skinned privileged woman who dared to legitimate her  intrusion by being merely 'interested' in  issues that affect those of us who are segre-  gated and brutalized because of our colour.  White senior staff of Women In View  and the white owner and staff of Josephine's  Coffee Bar, at which Women In View had so  scheduled this session, were all comfortably  seated around the First Nations, African,  Asian, Arab and South American women,  ready to devour that which was reserved for  ourselves, most notably our honesty and  vulnerability. We had been infiltrated, yet  again, by a group of white women not wanting to be excluded.  The offensive and racist destruction of a  space that, by our presence, was created by,  for and about racialized women, permeated  the short 90 minutes we had together. Even  though the five white women were told to  leave and did so, a Josephine staff person  made sure she first told the group of non-  white women not to go into the kitchen or  behind the counter, [implying] don't cook or  steal a lousy cup of coffee. What was the  basis for this distrust?  The networking session was an opportunity to dialogue about anger, tiredness,  and the health hazards caused by racism in  the context of our everyday lives. We talked  about whether or not Women of Colour  artists haveparticularresponsibilitiesaround  addressing the realities and politics of race,  representation and racism in the course of  our writings, performance arts, visual art  and other with the refusal of mainstream  white feminists, publishers, theatres, schools,  etc., to make our contributions widely accessible to our diverse communities.  Inevitably, the discussion among those  in attendance turned to a review of the  Women In View Festival. Many of those  present, both performers and those who had  attended various performances, took issue  with, among other things: that there was no  conspicuous committment to ensure that  women of colour would have adaquate access to all women of colour events; that the  somewha t available workshop subsidies and  sliding scale tickets were not advertised, and  so not fairly distributed; that poor women  with chidren were forced to rely on unreliable festival childcare that was available for  only two of the advertised three days of the  ten-day program; that the second scheduling of Fast Life on a Lazy Susan and Let's Not  Talk About Race Issues took place only 20  minutes apart from each other, forcing the  exclusion of Asian performers [from Fast  Life] from the only discussion space that had  been created for women of colour artists;  that a First Nations writer and a Chinese  writer felt separated and isolated from their  communities, and from other women of  colour, [in that] each appeared on programs  with white women, with whom they had,  said one, "nothing in common," lessening  the chance that there will be First Nations,  Chinese, and other women of colour in the  audience, though, as the Chinese woman  writer pointed out, her work is most intended for women of colour.  Following Let's Not Talk About Race Issues, a small group of participants got together elsewhere for a further critique of this  non-feminist theatre and arts organization,  making the links between the perceived resistance to anti-racist change and the few  women of colour within the organization,  including the low numbers of individuals  and communities of women of colour on the  Board, and the even fewer number among  the paid staff.  With each passing day, women of colour still absorb the brunt of the assaults  when white "feminists" and non-feminists  alike do not consistently undertake their  responsibilities around ending white  supremacy, and class oppression, and  lesbophobia, and the alienation of people  with disabilities, and the continuous unavailability of childcare, and...  My experience at this event is but one of  so many instances where, bit by bit, my time,  energy and health is annihilated by the actions of many white-skinned privileged  women.  I look forward to Women In View doing  the critical analysis that is necessary if it is to  go beyond token offerings of satisfaction,  and instead enter the realm of full and equal  leadership, participation and representation  of diverse communities of women throughout the festival.  I am writing this as an African lesbian  activist and essayist living in Toronto, with  the support of Burcu Ozdemir, who also  attended the session and is a Muslim lesbian  mother who smokes a lot and lives in Vancouver.  Adonica Huggins,  Toronto, Ontario  WIV responds  Kinesis:  We would like to respond to the letter  submitted by Adonica Huggins in regards to  the Women in View Festival.  Women in View is a non-profit organization which originated seven years ago by  a small group of women who perceived the  need to create opportunities for women in  the performing arts. Through the course of  the last five years, this modest vision has  grown to entail year-round programming  and a yearly ten-day festival, the only one of  its kind in Canada, that has come to include  more than 75 presentations of theatre, music, dance, interdisciplinary work and literary readings, as well as ten workshops, a  concert and dance, networking sessions and  a symposium.  This has been achieved with limited  funding through the dedicated work of a  small staff and the voluntary contribution of  a Board of Directors, an Advisory Committee and hundreds of members and volunteers.  Women in View is a performing arts  organization interested in integrating the  efforts of women from all artistic disciplines,  and in reaching out to women across classes,  cultures and ethnic backgrounds. This is  reflected in the following areas:  • Selection of program participants: for  the 1993 Festival, 25 percent of all applications received were by women of colour and  50 percent of the voting members of the jury  that made the final selection were women of  colour.  • Programming: in the 1993 Festival, 25  percent of theatre, music, dance and interdisciplinary performances were initiated by  women of colour, 44 percent of the reading  writers and 44 percent of the workshop leaders were women of colour.  • Composition of the Board: 33 percent  women of colour.  • Composition of the staff: between 15  percent and 20 percent women of colour.  • Access: in 1993, Women in View distributed more than 600 free tickets, in addition to offering partial and full subsidies to  women's organizations and individuals.  As a matter of fact, View is the only  festival held in the Lower Mainland that, in  spite of financial difficulties, offers free and  subsidized access on such a large scale. Furthermore, it is the only one that has made an  effort to secure funding for the provision of  professional day-care services during the  busiest days of the Festival (the January 31  day-care was cancelled because the only  person who had signed up, decided not to  make use of this service).  Clearly, there are issues that Women in  View still needs to address in order to make  the Festival as inclusive and accessible as we  would like it to become. We welcome everybody's input and participation as we continue to grow and improve. The evolution of  the Festival during its five years of existence  shows our willingness to work together and  take concrete steps towards the creation of  opportunities for all women in the performing arts.
