The date of the Rally  had to be changed because it was  learned that the opening date of the  Legislature would not be until March  17 and we wanted to be certain that  all MLAs would be in Victoria on the  day of the Rally.  Vancouver Status of Women is one of  the groups that is helping to coordinate the Rally and women from  all over the province — as far  north as Atlin', — are involved.  This Rally is for every woman in B.C.I  Woman's Rally for Action is an opportunity for us to learn how our elected representatives intend to represent  our interests. Few MLAs have stated  their position on issues of special  concern to women and the Social Credit  Party is the only provincial party  without a platform on women's rights.  As a result, the women of B.C. do not  know if their MLAs are interested in  dealing with the inequities women face  in our legal, educational, economic  and political systems. March 22nd  will be an opportunity for each MLA  to learn about the needs of women  in his/her riding and make known her/  his commitmentto meeting those needs.  Every MLA has been contacted for an  appointment and will be interviewed  by a team of women from his/her riding. Each team of lobbyists will represent the women in their particular  riding and will bring letters from  women in their riding and briets outlining problems and recommendations  especially pertinent to that area.  At the end of the Rally the teams will  convey the statements and commitments  made by each MLA back to her/his riding.  WHAT CAN YOU DO? (  This Rally is in the interests of  every woman in B.C. and every one of  us should participate!  Some ridings still need a lobbying  team, extras can be used too. Contact Johanna den Hertog, 2029 West  4th, Vancouver, 736-3746.  If you are not on a lobbying Team but  can come to Victoria—COME! Every one  of us in Victoria on March 22 will be  representing hundreds of women unable  to be there. The more of us the better  —some MLAs think there are no women  in their riding! COME! there'll be  lots to do!  Whether or not you can come to Victoria  there are many ways to participate...  . Join a committee.

What an effect that  would have! And we can do it! Let  them know we are out there!  You might say something like:  Dear    I am unable to be in Victoria on  March 22nd to participate in the Women's Rally for Action so I am writhing to express my concern about the  status of women in this province.  The closure of the office of the Provincial Coordinator of the Status of  Women indicated a lack of understanding about the depth of inequality that  women face in our society. I would  hope that all elected representatives  in Victoria would press for increased  attention to important issues such as  the Berger Commission recommendations,  on community of property in marriage,  sexism in education, funding of women's  centres, equal opportunity programs,  economic opportunities for women,and  childcare.  I am your constituent and I am represented by you in the Legislative  Assembly. I expect interest and understanding from you regarding the issues  that affect the status of women in  this province, and a comffli>tm.ent"-from- •  you towards rememedying the discrimination and inequality that women face..  Sincerely   Try to mention particular issues in  your area that the MLA can take action on. Try to adjust the letter to  suit the MLA - eg. if you know he/she  is sympathetic and has worked for  change, etc. If you have NO idea  where he/she stands ask him/her to  give you specific answers. And ask  for a reply. Every letter they have  to answer is a jog to the brain about  those particular issues.  WRITE YOUR LETTER TODAY! You do count  to them - after all you are a VOTE!  WHERE TO GO AND W  The Women's Rally for Action will take  place in front of the Parliament Bldgs.  in Victoria.

AND EVERY ONE  OF US CAN AND SHOULD  TAKE PART!  - Jo Lazenby WOMEN AND ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  ROLE OF WOMEN IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  (Excerpts of speech by Eileen Caner,  Director, Women's Economic Rights  Branch, Department of Economic Development to Terrace Women's Organization, Sept. 75)  Tonight I should like to talk "  about the right of women to participate in the decision-making of economic development in this province.  Why is this right not automatically  extended to them? How can we open  pathways to this goal?  ...economic  development affects the lives of all  of us ...democracy presupposes we  have some control over the way our  region develops ...yet, in this province, women are not involved in  making the decisions which so closely shape their lives.  Male dominated structures form  a communications network, a class  phenomenon.  The cross-over points in  this network represent power,positions as being located in a landscape easily recognized by the people  who occupy them.  They take for granted its existence ...the objectives of  life which are significant to this  population.  This landscape is almost entirely inhabited by men.  The men moving  in this territory listen to and treat  as significant only what men say.  From this class, women have largely  been excluded.  They have been admitted only as special exceptions  and as individuals.  They are never  admitted as representatives of their  sex.  Women can enter this class only  by learning to operate within the  male landscape, but knowing all the  time they are in an alien land.  They  retain their residence permits as  long as they are willing to deny the  validity of their own experience, to  suppress their own value system, to  use male ideologies.  Women have to start consciously  sharing in the construction of their  own social reality. We have to start  mapping our own landscape, reinforcing our own networks, accepting what  women say as important. We not only  need access, we also need this firm  base of female territory for successful operation. We not seriously  affect the centres of decision making until we are part of the organization ... Our participation needs  to count...  And now I should like to talk  about the impact of women on the  economic development-process. What  difference will the presence of  women make? ...in what respects,  will their answers be different?  If the terms of reference of  economic development are drawn up  on the assumption that women are  dependents of men and not persons  responsible for their own economic  future, then the studies ... will  deliver programs that validate and  reinforce that original dependency.  Economic expansion rarely  results in economic development for  marginal groups, unless a conscious  decision to change the position of  the group is built into the terms  of reference ... Clearly, we have  to see that enough trained women  are pulled up through the system  by an affirmative action process ..  at all levels of government.  Another solution is to place  a small group of aware, well-trained and technically expert women  within every major institution concerned with economic development to  raise the women's issues within all  institutions. These are the questions we should be asking:  1. Does the economic development offer equivalent benefits to men and  women?  2. Will the impact of the program  on women in the development area  be considered at the design, implementation and evaluation stages? ■ ' ' <  3. Should women in this particular  area be a target group for special programs?  4. Are women involved in the decision-making, evaluation and program delivery process of the economic development planned?  5. Is any action planned to enable  women to enter the community's  economic life?  6. Are job training opportunities  for women coiisidered with outreach programs?  7. Are necessary community support  services to enable women to move  into the labour force being assesses? (eg. daycare)  8. Is a woman visibly responsible for  delivering special programs to  women?  9. What action is taken to ensure the  community development plan will  result in integration of women into the economic and social power  structure?  10.Are the terms of reference of socioeconomic studies relevant to  icommunity women?  Economic development comes as  a packageo  Industrial and resource  development comes with a concern for  impact on physical and social envir-.  onments and includes necessary physical and social infrastructures.  Women have a special role here.  Women by reason of their role  in society will see certain areas  more urgently and clearly as an essential part of economic development  working women  than will many males. These women  are afterall the persons who endure  long hours of frustration in trailer camps, who live without adequate  daycare facilities, who lack adequate transporation, who develop mental health problems because of isolation and boredom.  THE WOMEN KNOW  WHAT SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURES SHOULD  BE BUILT INTO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  PLANS.  I should like to make the  following suggestions to women:  .Know how economic and resource development is delivered  in B.C., who is responsible for  what, in which areas. Which departments and levels of government are  involved?  .Collect studies, reports,  newsletters and press releases  which are current.  Put yourself  on the mailing list of the information officers of the appropriate  government departments, regional  and community development structures.  .Identify parts of the administrative system which are sympathetic to the needs of women in  B.C.  It is a worthwhile exercise  in political sophistication.  Send  briefs, write letters, telephone  in emergency situations. Ask government to send you speakers when  you have concerns which fall under  their jurisdiction.  Come and talk  with government when you are in  Victoria. All the commitment  should not come from government.  It is also your job to educate us.  •Whenever you deal with any  power structure connected to economic development ask how many  women are employed at the decisionmaking levels.  .Run for office in all provincial, regional and community  power structures.  .Press for specific changes.  Use local radio stations or tear-  off sheets in local newspapers.  Town meetings are poor for female  participation.  Few women are conditioned to use the public forum0  We rarely see provision for day  care and transporation for them to  be able to attend.  The women in  isolated areas are seldom consulted. There are ways of reaching  them.  Responsibility for one's own  life is something possessed by and  enjoined by us all.

The FDA has drafted new labelling for  oral contraceptives to bring doctors  up to date on possible hazards. One  specific warning is that women over  forty should be encouraged to use  other means of birth control, based  on the results of a British study  showing that women in this age group  taking the pill are almost five times  more likely than women not taking the  pill to suffer fatal heart attacks.  ***********  Nutritionists at a recent conference  at Columbia University in New York  City urged further study into whether  or not women taking oral contraceptives need vitamin supplements. In  studies, oral contraceptive users,  in comparison to non-users were shown  to have altered blood levels of nutrients.  - Health Right newsletter  Winter 75/76.  send for  Send for the Rocky Mountain Planned  Parenthood Publication List, 2030  East 20th Ave, Denver, Colorado 80205  They have posters on vasectomy, the  right to abortion, male responsibility  in pregnancy; leaflets on responsible  sexuality for boys and for girls, not  victimizing women, self-health care  for girls, vasectomy, male-female  relationships, outreach for family  planning workers, the perils of  puberty for girls; and the Male  Chauvinist Pig Colouring Book for  Dona Luggen, a 24 year old American  woman, died February 21, 1974 from  pulmonary embolism, a blood clot to  the lung caused by the Pill.

I waited, with some interest to hear  what was funny, because with Maudie  it can be anything from Wayne and  Shuster to Bulgarian plum jam. I  particularly enjoyed the jam session  which started when Maudie found jam  from Bulgaria selling at a lower  price than the local products. From  there we went through the merits,  or otherwise, of the Capitalist and  Communist systems; what Marx would  say today (Karl not Groucho); through  Sociology 100 with a dash of Keynes,  ending-up in the Garden of Eden  pondering on The Meaning Of It All.  "Consciousness raising," said Maudie,  "it really makes you think."  Refraining personfully from pointing  out that that was the object of the  exercise, I asked what she had been  thinking about.  "Opera," she said fixing me with a  challenging look, "Iwatched the Barber  of Seville on Channel 9 and its the  first time I actually saw an opera.  I usually just listen to the Met on  Saturday afternoons."  What had started Maudie's little grey  cells on the move was the idiocy of  the plot (I use the word loosely).  Resina, the 'heroine' is a drivelling  twittering idiot kept virtually locked up by her elderly guardian who is  determined to marry her for her money,  which would of course then be is. Both  ONE fINE  DAY  the male leads, however, wore tight  pants and moustaches and lept about  the stage, flashing teeth and machismo  which gave Maudie the fidgets. And  what about that Madame Butterfly,  said she, warming to the subject.  That Pinkerton gets her pregnant,  leaves her, and when he returns,  brings his American wife, though  what a civilian woman is doing aboard  an American Navy ship beats me. And  Butterfly quietly kills herself rather'  than make a fuss. Nearly as daft as  Lucia, but she at least dies in the  grand manner.  Not to be outdone,I nominated Gilda  from Rigoletto as my candidate for  witless woman. Knowing her Ducal lover  is a philanderer (opera has a way of  making you use words like that) she  still sacrifices her life to save his  and Maudie had to agree, you can't get  much dumber than that.  All became clear when we looked to  see who had written these Grand Soap  Operas. All were based on novels and  plays written by men and the librettists are as follows: Cesare Sterbini  (The Barber), Luigi Illica and Guiseppe  Giacesa (Butterfly), Salvatore Cam-  marano  (Lucia) and Francesco Prave  (Rigoletto). I rest my case.  But what really was interesting to me  was that although International Women's Year can hardly be described as  a howling success, many previously  uncommitted women, like Maudie, really  do look at things in a different way,  and while this is unmeasurable and  undramatic, in the obvious sense, it  is really what the Women's Movement  is all about.  As for the Opera, Maudie and I decided  just to enjoy the music and ignore the  rest.  - Margaret Nicholls  MEANWHILE....  Meanwhile Back in the Kitchen.  The ads tell it like it really is or  do they? Man conquers unclimbed  peak, leans back with a contented  smile on face, appropriate beer in  hand and proceeds to tell of his  feats.  Beautiful woman may or may  not be smiling encouragement at him.  Enter the recreational vehicle in  another ad.

Exit men of  the household on a hiking or fishing  trip. Meanwhile back in the camper  Mom and little Suzi having nothing  better to do, begin to prepare dinner and feel unaccountably crabby.  The community recreation programs  (some of them) tell it like it is  too? Father and son hockey nights,  father and son sport leagues.  On  response to the question whether a  father could bring his daughter to  hockey.  "Well maybe, anyhow the program isn't that full."  "Hey Mom," yells little Suzi, coming  in the back door after school.  "This  lady was telling us all about these  different programs we can take. There's  cosom hockey for boys and easy sewing  for girls, but boys can take sewing if  they want to."  Mom is overhead muttering to self, "Some  choice! Now if sewing had been pictured  thus - Find yourself in the wilderness  without a button on your pants, with a  broken knapsack strap, with a torn pair  of pants? Then sign up now for the basics of survival sewing."  Books are incredibly still telling it  like it is? You'll find boys and their  dogs, boys pitted against relentless  nature, boys rescuing wounded animals -  the list is endless. A recent dedication in the front of a children's adventure story reads thus:  "For" then  came the names of three boys "and" followed by a girl's name with "why not"  written in brackets!  Better then nothing I suppose.  "You're nit-picking," someone objects.  "Now if little Suzi were living in  Switzerland she would doubtless find  herself plopped into a domestic arts  course while brother Billy is tossed  into gym and woodworking." "But," I  object, "how much choice is there really? We're still not looking at kids  as individuals having distinct likes  and dislikes. How free is Billy now to  take sewing if he wants to?  Is Suzi  still being called a tomboy because she  likes to dash around on the sports fieldc  Meanwhile, back in the kitchen the sauce  spoon is still turning and becoming  somewhat sour in the process.  Finally,  Mom and Suzi put down their wooden  spoons, grin at each other and yell  at the top of their voices,"Hey you  out there, let's get it into print.  We need some adventure too."

Since  1966 no woman has been distinguished  with this major international  award.  SEXISM  in the  in the U.S.Ao for the first juvenile  court law, tenement house regulations,  an eight-hour working day for  women, child labor laws, factory  inspection, and workmen's compensation.  She also advocated research to determine  the causes of poverty and crime,  and supported women's suffrage.  NOBEL  AWARDS?  This fact makes one wonder whether  the women present in all areas  of human knowledge throughout  the world have become invisible to  the various Nobel Prize committees  during the last nine years.  When  the 1975 awards were announced last  fall, women were again absent.  Is there sexism in the Nobel Prize  Awards?  Committee members responsible for  selecting winners didn't seem to  suffer from total blindness between  1903 and 1946. During this 43-year  span, nine women were awarded the  Nobel:  Marie Curie (1903, Physics;  1911, Chemistry); Baroness Bertha  von Suttner (1905, Peace); Selma  Lagerlof (1909, Literature); Grazia  Deledda (1926, Literature); Jane  Addams (1931, Peace); Irene Joliot-  Curie (1935, Chemistry); Pearl S"  Buck (1938, Literature); Gabriela  Mistral (1945, Literature); and  Emily Greene Balch (1946, Peace).  After 1956 acute myopia set in.  It wasn't until 1963, when physicist Maria Goepper-Mayer shared it  with two other scientists that  a woman was awarded the Nobel Prize  again. Next, Dorothy M0Cc Hodgkin  received the 1964 Award for  Chemistry and then Nelly Sachs  shared the 1966 Award for Literature  with another writer. And that was  the end of it.  The Nobel Prizes were established by  Alfred B. Nobel, inventor of dynamite,  to be awarded yearly to those who have  most benefited mankind in the fields  of physics, chemistry, medicine  or phsiology, literature, and peace.  A new field, economy, was added in  1969o  Throughout the years, the various  Nobel Prize committees seem to  have interpreted "who have most  benefited mankind" in peculiar  ways.  As everybody knows, controversial opinions, many critical of  the committees criteria for the  selection of the winners, are  reported in the world press every  time the awards are announced.  Among the women winners, many were  active pacifists and feminists,  and all of them truly benefited  mankind in one way or another.  Three women pacifists were awarded  the Nobel Prize for Peace.  Baroness Bertha von Suttner (1843-1914)  a minor Austrian novelist, was one  of the first notable women pacifists.  In 1891 she founded an Austrian  pacifist organization, and from  1892 to 1899 she edited an international pacifist journal. Her  pacifism, however, lacked a working-  class bias and was intended to  convince the upper-middle class.  While Baroness von Suttner's  pacifism and humanitarianism  ^Bp^ ^^ ____\  ¥  S             1.50  Mi.

Jane Addams  (1860-1935), an American social  reformer, pacifist, writer and  feminist, was actively involved in  promoting' the welfare of the  working classes.  Her attention was  particularily focused on the plight  of the Negroes and the immigrants  living in the large industrialized  centres of the U.S.A.  In 1899, With her friend Elfen Gates  Starr, Jane Addams founded Hull House  which was to become well known to  social reformers everywhere.  One of  the first social settlements in  North America, it was designed to  serve the needs of the largely  immigrant population of the  poorest areas of Chicago.  Among the facilities provided by  Hull House were a day nursery,  a gymnasium, a community kitchen,  and a boarding club for young working  women.  In addition, it offered working  people college-level courses in  various subjects, as well as training  in art, music, and various crafts.  Jane Addams was involved in various  social reform projects. She worked  with labor and other reform groups  American feminist and pacifist Jane  Addams won the 1931 Nobel Prize for  Peace.;-,..u^i-Jaaui •  In 1910 she became the first woman  president of the National Conference  of Social Work. At the Hague in  1915 she was chairperson of the  Internation Congress of Women, following which was established the Women's  International League for Peace and  Freedom. Jane Addams was opposed  to U"SoAo entry into World War I.  Her public anti-war position caused  her to be regarded with disfavor  by many Americans"  Her social work brought her, and  another American, the 1931 Nobel  Prize for Peace. The Social Thought  of Jane Addams (1950), edited by  Christopher Lash, presents a collection of her writings on various social  issues.  Like Jane Addams, her fellow American  Emily Greene Balch (1867-1961) was  committed to social reform and  pacifism.  She was also opposed to  U.S.A. entry into World War I, an  attitude that cost her"her job at  Wellesley (Massachussetts) College,  where she had been a teacher for  about twenty years at the time of  her dismissal.  A sociologist, political scientist,  economist, pacifist and writer,  Emily G. Balch was also a leader of  the women's movement for peace  during and after World War I.  She  attended the International Congress  of Women at The Hague in 1915 and  helped found the Women's International  League for Peace and Freedom.  She published several books, among  them, one on peace (Approaches to the  the Great .Settlement, 1918).  She  and another fellow American shared  the 1946 Nobel Prize for Peace.  In the sciences, four women were  distinguished with the Nobel.  One of them was Polish-born Marie  Curie (1867-1934), whose discovery  of radium and polonium, and isolation  of radium brought her the 1911 Nobel  Prize for Chemistry.  Before that, she  and her husband Pierre had shared the  1903 Nobel Prize for Physics,  awarded for their joint investigations  of the radiation phenomena previously  discovered by AoH. Becquerel.  Of all the Nobel Prize winners, Marie  Curie is certainly one of the most  famous throughout the world.  Even  Hollywood' immortalized her on the  screen.  From childhood, she had been  remarkable for her prodigious  memory and intelligence. Her political  and social beliefs led Marie Curie,  while working as a teacher in Poland,  to take part in a clandestine nationalist "free university", where she rea-  in Polish to women workers.  In 1891  she went to Paris to attend the  Sorbonne0  An ambitious woman determined to  succeed in her goal, Marie Curie often  worked far into the night in her garret  in the students' quarters, where she lived on a diet of bread, butter  and tea.  In 1893, at the age of 26,  she obtained her first university  degree, ranking first place. Her  marriage to Pierre Curie in 1895 was  the beginning of a partnership that  was to achieve world significance.  After his sudden death in 1906,  Marie Curie devoted herself entirely  to the scientific work they had  undertaken.  She became the first  woman professor at the Sorbonne.  MPUBUOUI FftANGAtS  ,060.  French stamp honouring Marie Curie,  winner of Nobel Prize for Chemistry  in 1911.  The Curies were a remarkable family  of scientists:  Pierre and Marie,  their daughter Irene, and their  son-in-law Frederic Joliot.  Irene  (1897-1956) wrote her doctoral thesis  on the alpha rays of polonium,  receiving her doctorate in 1925.  Ten years later, her synthesis of  new radioactive elements brought her  the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.  As scientists, the Curies had a high  idea of their human and social  responsibilities. Like her mother,  a supporter of the suffrage movement,  Irene Curie was convinced that women  did not have the place in society they  deserved. As undersecretary of  state for scientific research, she  helped lay the foundations of what  would later become in France the  National Centre for Scientific  Research. And yet, twice did she  appear before the French Academy of  Sciences to affirm the right of  women to become members, but to no  avail.  Only two other women scientists  have been awarded the Nobel Prize"  One is Dorothy M.Co Hodgkin, a  British chemist born in 1910"  Her  determination of the structure of  biochemical compounds essential in  fighting pernicious anemia brought  her the 1964 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.  Dorothy Hodgkin, who spent much of  h^r time in the 1960's at the Univers:-  ity of Ghana, also did research on  the structural analysis of penicillin.  In addition, she and her colleagues  succeeded in obtaining the first X-  ray photograph of vitamin B-.2, onE  of the most complex non-protein compounds.  The other woman is Maria Goeppert-  Mayer, whose development of the  shell theory of the structure of  the atomic nuclei brought her and  two other scientists the 1963 Nobel  Prize for Physics.  Born in Poland in 1906 and now an  American citizen, Maria Goeppert-  Mayer received her doctorate from  the University of Gottingen in  1930. In 1939 she went to Columbia  University, where she worked on the  seperation of uranium isotopes for  the atomic bomb project, and in  1945 she went to the Institute of  Nuclear Studies at the University  of Chicago. In 1960 she became professor of physics at the University  of California.  In literature, five women, writers  have been awarded the Nobel Prize0  Selma Lagerlof (1858-1940), a Swedish  writer best remembered for the  meaning and depth she gave to  material of folk origin, was given  the Nobel in 1909 for her work's  "lofty idealism, vivid imagination  and spiritual perception."  Like most of the other women Nobel  Prize winners, Selma Lagerlof was  also a pacifist and a feminist.  She interceded through the"Swedish  Royal family to save a future Nobel  Prize winner, the poet Nelly Sachs,  from a German concentration camp,  in 1940. Among her books, translated  into English, Tales of a Manor is  considered one of her finest, and  Jerusalem established her as the  foremost Swedish writer"  The 1926 Nobel Prize for Literature  went to Grazia Deledda (1875-1936),  an outstanding Italian writer of the  naturalistic school.  Almost without any formal schooling,  Grazia Deledda wrote her first stories  at 17, based on sentimental treatment  of folklore themes.  Then she began  to write about how temptation and  sin affected her brooding, taciturn  characters struggling against a  primitive background. Among her best  novels are Ashes (1904), in which an  illegitimate son causes his mother's  suicide; and The Mother (1920), the  story of a mother who realizes her  dream of her son's becoming a priest  only to see him yield to the temptations  of the flesh. Deledda's native  Sardinia provides the setting of most  of her work.  Pearl Buck (1892-1973), the well-  known writer of best-selling novels  of life in China, won the 1938 Nobel  Prize. Why Pearl Buck and not  Willa Cather, whose art, in the  opinion of critics, was far superior  to .that of most post-World-War I  American writers? It seems that in  the eyes of the Nobel Prize selecting  committee, Pearl Buck's fiction met  the criterion of a "literary work of  idealistic tendency". Her work has  been widely translated, and novels  such as The Good Earth (1931) are still  popular.  The 1945 Nobel for literature was  awarded to Gabriela Mistral (1899-  1957), pen name of Lucila Godoy  Alcayaga, a Chilean poet and  educator.  She was the first Latin  American writer to win the Nobel  Prize for Literature.  Gabriela Mistral, founder of the  modernist movement in Chilean  poetry, was of Spanish, Basque and  Indian descent. She had a distinguished career in her country, serving in the Foreign Service of Chile  and at the League of Nations. She  also taught at Barnard and Middle-  bury Colleges in the U.S.A.  Her poems show compassion for the  humble and the needy. Her best-  known books of poems include  Desolation (1922), Tenderness (1924),  Felling of Trees (1934), Winepress  (1954). The Afro-American poet  Langston Hughes translated into  English a selection of her poems,  published in 1957.  The only other woman to win the  Nobel Prize is Swedish writer Nelly  Sachs, who shared the 1966 Prize for  Literature with another writer"  Born in Berlin in 1891, she fled to  Sweden in 1940, and later became a  Swedish citizen,,  Nelly Sachs, whose work is little  known outside Sweden and Germany, was  awarded the Nobel "for her outstanding  lyricfel and dramatic writing, which  interprets Israel's destiny with  touching strength." Among her  books are And No One Knows Where to  Go (1957) and Flight and Metamorphosis  (1959).  - Eloah F.

I have received a long letter from  Mr. WoHo Wightman, Director, Industrial Relations & Social Affairs, CMA,  and here are some pertinent excerpts:  "I feel I should emphasize that  responsibility for the absence of  women among the employer members  of the Council rests solely with  me rather than the Government of  Canada or the Canadian Labour Congress o"  (He goes on to outline the criteria  for choosing members - that they  should be from among people who-would  be representative of Canadian employers in the broadest possible sense0)  "At the same time current and practical experience in the field, as  well as some personal knowledge of  the individuals involved on both  sides of the table, seemed to me  to be of paramount importance in  considering the initial group of  nominees. As their terms of office  expire other criteria and, there-1  fore, other personalities may  suggest themselves."  "Specific issues to which the' Council will address itself are to be  referred to panels of experienced  individuals seconded from labour  and management. This device should  also enable us to involve a wider  spectrum of people in our most  important work."  (NOW HERE IS THE GOOD PART - Mr.  Wightman expects that opportunities  will occur for new nominations to  both the Council and its panel")  "Should qualified women be available  they would not only be considered  but welcomed. Indeed, if I can  impose on you, I would like you  to consider this an invitation to  provide me with any suggestions  you may have now or in the future."  (He goes on to some general discussion re the economic guidelines and  their effects» His letter ends with:)  "It has been my personal observation  that, for whatever reasons, women  letter  lobby  Dorothy Holme  are to be found in corporate level  jobs in increasing numbers but  not commonly in the industrial  relations functionc We certainly  need more able people in this field  irrespective of their sex" Let's  hope the efforts of your organization are helpful in this regard."  THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO  ACT! We have already enlisted the  help of the National Action Committee  and the federal Advisory Council. Mrc  Wightman's statement that there is a  lack of women in industrial relations  ^.s, unfortunately,true. But I refuse  to believe that in this vast country  of ours, we cannot find the gentleman  some qualified women.  The Letter Lobby Committee would like  to call on VSW members to submit names  (with a short resume) of any women  that they think may be suitable.  Right now I can't give too detailed  a description of the duties involved.  The present members have full-time  jobs and this was not a barrier to  their being chosen. The Council's  main function will be to find ways  to create and maintain industrial  peace, and no doubt consideration  will be given to just what is a "fair  wage" for Canadians. And women certainly have a stake in this issue.  But let's not worry about the details  at this point - the main thing is to  compile a list of qualified women0  And since' Labour Minister John Munro,  the Chairman, and Joe Morris, Chief  Labour representative, are also  sensitive to this question, there  should be no excuse for not appointing women in the future.  *********************  Several people have asked me to  give them a few tips for successful  letter lobbying - so here are some  techniques that have worked well for  me and other members of our Committee:  10 You must have a valid cause and  be  polite,.thorough and persistent.  2..Write to the cabinet ministers  under whose jurisdiction your problem falls, and preferably one to  whom you can relate. Initially, I  don't send copies of my correspondence to MPs. I find the response  is better if the MP is a member of  the Opposition. This can always  be used as a reserve weapon if the  issue drags on. Then copies of  these letters will provide the  MP with invaluable ammunition  during question period. Use your  own judgement.  3. If you can involve two or more  cabinet ministers as well as the  Erime Minister - it will be to  your advantage. Public pressure  is a significant factor in determining what issues get priority on  the order paper.  4. Try to write at a time when the  ministers are not involved in a  crisis of some kind, ego labour  disputes. They will have more time  to answer your letter.  5. Never pressure the ministers to  give an opinion on an issue not  under their jurisdiction. Inter-  cabinet relationships are often  delicate - today's colleague may  be tomorrow's leader. If one minister cannot comment on your question, he/she will usually forward  it to someone who can.  6. Politicians receive more criticism  than praise, If you can say some- .  thing good about their past work, -  do so. If you cannot, try to find  a favourable article and quote  from it - phoney praise will soon  be detected.  7. Know your subject. Also be prepared to phrase your question in several ways. In other words, don't  stop at one letter if you think  the answer you received was not  entirely satisfactory0 Thank the  person for what you did receive,  and write again asking for further  clarification0  8. Politicians are people - approach  them on an equal basis. You don't  have to be overbearing nor should  you be wishy-washy - just be firm  in your request for.answers.  I hope these "tips" will help our  members who are involved in the fascinating - and serious - business of  letter lobbying!  Dorothy Holme  FAMILY LAW  FAMILY LAW OMBUDSSERVICE  We are a group of women who are seeking to offer a solution to the many  women who encounter problems in Family  Court processes. The situation at the  Family Courts (other than the Unified  Family Court in the Delta/Surrey/Richmond area) is often an alienating and  intimidating experience to endure al  alone.  Even though the court personnel  have knowledge of court procedures  and family law issues, they are often  too busy to communicate this knowledge.  This temporal restriction is often  interpreted as a lack of understanding or support. Hence, a woman may  be leery of the court at a time when  she is most likely to need a confidante.  Our service will offer emotional  support, family law information,  court accompaniment, and referral  to other social services if necessary.  We will act as liason between court  personnel and the women involved. We  will work towards implementation of  the Unified Family Court system  throughout B.C. by informing the public about the work of various law  reform commissions.  We are requesting funding of $30,000  for 2 full-time salaries and office  space from the Provincial Government  and various social service agencies  and foundations. We hope to begin  operation April 1st, 1976.  - Conni Bagnal, 736-5394  JOBS  UNITED NATIONS SEEKS WOMEN  THe United Nations is seeking professional women for overseas vacancies.

Schools was terminated and  the Provincial Advisory Committee on  Sex Discrimination in Schools was  disbanded (Page 3). In her Letter  Lobby column (Page 8) Dorothy Holme  urged VSW members to write the Education Minister Patrick McGeer protesting these decisions. She herself  wrote to Dr. McGeer and he has sent  a copy of his reply to KINESIS with  the following note attached:  "Dear Ms. Lazenby,  While I was pleased to receive your  February issue of KINESIS, I was not  so pleased to note the assumptions  of your writers with regard to the  recent decisions of the Department  of Education involving the role of  the Special Advisory Committee on  Sex Discrimination in B.C. public  schools. It is hoped that the copy  of letter to your colleague, Mrs.  Dorothy Holme, will put the situation  in proper perspective.  P.L.M. "  The letter from Education Minister  McGeer to Letter Lobby Committee  Co-ordinator Dorothy Holme follows:  "Dear Mrs. Holme,  In reply to your recent inquiry of  the Premier and expressions of concern over the future of the Depart-r-  ment's Special Adviser on Sex Discrimination in the British Columbia  school system, I wish to assure you  that a review of the progress of the  Committee over the last two years is  underway. As Minister, I share many  of your on-going concerns, even though  progress apparently has been made.  a  Women throughout B.C. are properly  concerned about equal educational  rights for both sexes, the stereo  role of women that prevails in some  school texts, equal opportunities for  women in administration, incentives  for women to become involved in management, improvement in the attitude  of school counsellors toward career  achievement for young women, and the  more equitable sharing of funds for  school athletic programs.  I am confident that these concerns  can, and will, be addressed by the  Government. The question remains:  what about the future of the Committee  and the role of the "Special Adviser?"  The enclosed copy of the February 4th  press release should answer this  question. With respect to the Commits  tee, I can only add that during the  termination period, its work will be  reviewed and new proposals made for  maintaining progress in the areas  concerned.  Meanwhile, I hope that you, as an  individual concerned with women's  rights in B.C., will give the new  Government time to react and not  reach hasty conclusions about our  desires or the reasoning behind our  actions.  Yours Sincerely,  Patrick L. McGeer  Minister of Education  The press release referred to by Dr.  McGeer was issued February 4th by  Information Services, Department of  Education:  "Deputy Minister of Education Walter  Hardwick has announced that Julia  Goulden, special advisor on sex discrimination in the schools to former  minister of education, will serve the  remainder of her term with the department of education as a program consultant.  "Ms. Goulden will continue to work  in many of the areas that she is already involved in," Dr. Hardwick said.  "However, in future she will be reporting through regular departmental  channels rather than serving as advisor to the minister."  D*. Hardwick said a reassessment of  Ms. Goulden's position within the  department became necessary when a  decision was made to disband the  provincial advisory committee on sex  discrimination. Ms. Goulden worked  with that committee in addition to  being a resource person to the department.  Ms. Goulden, a counsellor in the  Burnaby school system, has a one-  year contract with the department  which expires at the end of June.  "Though the committee no longer  exists, we intend to honor that contract because we believe that Ms.  Goulden has some contributions to  make in the whole area of sex discrimination in our schools," the  deputy minister said.  Dr. Hardwick listed the following as  some of the areas in which Ms. Goulden will continue to work:  Preparation of a guide book for teachers and counsellors on ways and means  of avoiding sex discrimination; working with classroom teachers to dis-i  cuss ways of offsetting the effect  of sex role stereo-typing; working  with counsellors to assist them in  developing career counselling; conducting workshops at the request of  teachers, district superintendents  and others; working with the women's  resources centre at the University of  B.C. to plan workshops and courses;  speaking to students, teachers and  parents and other groups.  Dr. Hardwick said that he has asked  for a departmental review of all advisory and consultative committees.  "I'm concerned about the effectiveness of the consultative and ad-  'visory process as it has existed in  the past," he said.'*'  Ms. Nadine Allen, former Chairperson  of the Advisory Committee on Sex Discrimination in the Schools, says she  is still puzzled as to why the Department of Education decided to disband  the Committee and the February 4th  press release ;does not provide any  enlightenment. The initial statement  on January 12th by John Meredith,  Superintendent of Educational Programs, that"there had recently been  a review of provincial financial and  other priorities in education" has  not been repeated. The Committee was  composed of volunteers and the cost  of operation was extremely small —  travel fares and lunches. When the  Committee was disbanded (or rumours  to that effect were circulating) Ms.  Allen sent a telegram to Dr. McGeer:  January 14,1976.  "Sex Discrimination Committee needs  immediate official clarification of  status. Have had no official termination and conflicting news reports add  to confusion. Impossible to believe  co-ordinator Goulden fired for budgetary reasons considering miniscule  expenses involved. Our work is vital.  We urge you to consider this a priority issue. Please inform us of future  of Committee and your position re  sex discrimination in schools."  When no reply was received Ms. Allen  sent another telegram on January 20th  requesting a meeting between the Provincial Advisory Committee and Dr.  McGeer on January 28th. She included  the Committee's terms of reference  and a list of Committee members and  pointed out that the committee was  composed of representatives cf a  cross-section of concerned and informed community groups. There was  no reply to this telegram either.  In fact,to date Ms. Allen has received no reply to any of her inquiries and the only official word she  as Chairperson has had is the January  12th statement by Mr. Meredith that  "It has been found necessary to discontinue the activities of some of  the advisory committees, at least  temporarily."  The Committee that was designed to  convey the needs of the community to  the Minister of Education has been  eliminated and as Ms. Allen points  out Ms. Goulden is in the greatly  reduced position of not only no  longer being responsible for seeing  that the Committee's views and suggestions are brought to the Education  Minister, but is also in the position  of having no particular part of the  Department to relay to the information she gathers through her work in  the community and schools.  "It is," says Ms. Allen, "as if a  wall has been placed between the  people and the department. How can  we be expected to be patient and  "not reach hasty conclusions" when  we are kept in the dark, our inquiries are ignored, and we see the vital  work that we were doing thwarted?"

Most of us are aware of the well-  known study of an American bank showing the average housewife's worth to  be about $300 per week (or $16,000  a year). This figure was computed by  comparing the work done by the housewife during her 100-hour (on the  average) workweek, with work of a  similar nature performed outside the  home, i.e. the duties of a cook,  nursemaid, bookkeeper, chauffeur,  etc. The idea was to assign a reasonable market value, hour for hour, to  housework.  All of us, of course, hoped that this  long-overdue recognition of the worth  of "women's work" would put to rest  forever the myth that housework is  easy, hence worthless, work — a notion a majority of men still prefer to  cling to.  Well, sisters, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but it appears that  we  are about to be disappointed again.  Off Our Backs, a Washington women's  news journal, reports that the U.S.  Social Security Administration has  just come out with a new study which  disputes the previous figures. The  study, entitled "The Economic Value  of Housework", instead places the  value of housework somewhere between  $5500 and $7500. Quite a difference,  considering that both studies used  the same means to calculate worth.  However, the joke is yet to come, and  it better not be on us. The S.S.A.,  a government agency, is reported to  have arrived at their figure by throwing in prostitutes' wages on top of  the usual, and more mundane, 'duties'  of the housewife!  Thanks,fellas.

Politically, this farming community  holds very conservative and traditional views on most issues and particularly on the position of women. The  area has voted very conservatively  for many years and only lately has  shown any signs of change.  information and devices have not been  widely distributed. As a result, there  is an accepted tradition of early  marriagesjand many women never become part of the work force, and are  never able to support themselves.  They exist completely as dependants  of the men.  In contrast to these women are the  farm women who actually have a role  This tiny ferry crosses the Peace River between"Doe  River and Clayhurst. This is the only way to get to  Clayhurst and in the winter when the river freezes  it is used as an 'ice bridge' between the two communities o Every morning a caterpiller is driven across  the ice to make certain it is safe to travel on.  The area is very isolated. Communication networks have not been firmly  established and the urban population  tends to be impermanent. As a result,  as soon as communication is established the organizers move on and the  system falters. Although the area is  part of British Columbia, the natural  trend for business and personal contacts is with Edmonton which is the  nearest large centre. The women of  North-east British Columbia are cut   ,  off from B.C. women, yet are not  really part of the Alberta women's  movement either.  The women of North-east B.C. seem to  simply be there with their men. There  are almost no employment opportunities for women beyond the traditional  — nurses, teachers, waitresses, store  and bank clerks, and domestic workers.  Until the NDP government opened Northern Lights College in September 1975,  there were no post-secondary educational institutions within 300 miles.  Thus, -.-women only come to the community because their fathers or husbands  have jobs there. They are economically  valueless.  Not only are there few employment  and educational opportunities, but  the women's choices are severely  limited in other ways. There are few  child care centres — and those that  do exist are so expensive they are  filled with children who qualify for  Department of Human Resources subsides, or those children with parents  who work at well paid jobs and can  afford the cost of day care.  With a traditional culture, few employment opportunities, no educational opportunities, and little reliable  communication with centres of feminist activity, the progress of women  in the North has been slow. There  are no models for women to emulate.  To make matters worse, birth control  in the community. These women are  self-reliant, hard-working partners-  within their marriages.  A farm family harvesting grain near  Rolla, B.C.  Their role is particularly noticeable  during the harvest. The man often  drives the combine while the woman  drives the grain truck alongside the  combine and receives the grain. Once  the truck is filled, the woman drives  the load to the elevator in town  while the husband continues to run  the combine, holding the grain in  the hopper until the woman returns.  The process continues from dawn at  around six a.m. until dark, around  11 p.m.  In addition to driving the grain  truck, the farm woman runs errands,  makes meals, does the laundry, and  bears full responsibility for care  th  one northern woman  A backyard in Dawson Creek in the  winter.  of the children. She is also responsible for the garden harvest which  entails canning and freezing, making  jams, relishes and pickles. In return  for her energy the farm woman has few  rights. She is not legally entitled  to a salary or part-ownership of the  family farm. Nor does she have any  legal power in the decisions made regarding the farm.  In the December 1975 Provincial  Election a new candidate emerged in  Northeastern British Columbia whose  campaign was amazingly successful by  any standards! Corliss Miller presented such a reasonable alternative for  the voters that she gained support  for her party at a time when popular  support was waning all over the province. She faced a double handicap in  her campaign: she faced sexism(epito- I  nized by the All-Candidate Meetings  inhere the other two candidates scram- I  bled to their feet ostentatiously  svenytime Miller walked to the mike  _to respond to a question) and as a  27 year old candidate, she was also  forced to combat discrimination directed against her youth.  Her success was indisputable! Through  hard work and continual energy,  Corliss and her campaign workers  increased the popular vote for the  STOP in Peace River South from 13%  to 31%.  Corliss Miller's success can be explained largely by her competence.  She is one of the few women in the  norther, agricultural community who  has found rewarding and challenging  work. She is the Co-ordinator of  Student Services for Northern Lights  Community College, established in .  1975 by the NDP Government, where she  performs both administrative work  and counselling. She has had to  struggle to gain full recognition  of her —she found there was a tendency to adjust the pay to the person  who was hired rather than to pay her  for the work that she was required  to do.  Miller considers herself a humanist  rather than a feminist. As a college  counsellor, however, whe recognizes  WOMEN OF THE PEACE  the problems faced by the women in  her community. She sees specific  practical problems — the lack of  jobs, the complete absence of career  opportunities, and the low wages —  as very serious. She also sees other,  more abstract problems, as crucial.  She is continually faced with the  poor self-concept of women students  which she sees partly as a product  of the pervasive influence of the  media. She finds that women learn  quickly that they must acquire a man  and then feel that maintaining this  relationship is.their primary responsibility. Miller would like to see  the Women's Movement put more emphasis  on working with teenage women before  the damage is done, before they de-'  velope the typical negative self-  image .  Miller was very satisfied with her  campaign, although she wonders whether the needs of her riding were taken  seriously. She feels that there is a  tendency to disregard the North and  concentrate on the needs of the population of Southern British Columbia.  She strongly supports greater regional participation in all B.C. affairs.'  Miller encourages women to participate in politics. She feels that  self-confidence is the key to successful participation for women,  and that with adequate self-confidence, sex discrimination can be ignored until it has only nuisance  value.  the   power project  The plight of farm women has received  a lot of attention in the past few  years, through the Murdoch case and  the Berger Commission recommendationsr  Perhaps the blatantly unfair Matrimonial Property laws, combined with the  funds and energy released through  the promotion of International Women's Year has created a situation in  which these Peace River women can  begin to understand-their situation  and perhaps make some changes.  One of the first attempts at understanding and change is The Power  Project, funded by the Secretary of  State and sponsored by the National  Farmers Union Women's Advisors.  Every July 1st Pouce Coupe holds  its Hospital Barbecue. Two steers  are cooked in a huge pit in the  ground and the proceeds are used  to support the Chronic Care Hospital  in Pouce Coupe.  The Peace Organization for Women's  Equal Rights Project started on January 1st and is expected to run for  three months. Its first goal is to  increase public awareness of women's  changing role in society. Other goals  are long range and indicate a full  recognition that the women's movement  must go beyond public awareness. The  Power Project hopes ultimately to  affect change in discriminatory laws  by presenting briefs to the federal  and provincial governments conveying  the needs of the women of the Peace.  The initial project however is educational and is tackling many basic women's issues in a series of sessions  dealing with employment, credit, law,  property rights, education, etc. etc.  The study sessions will be organized  in four different districts and each  district will have a salaried contact person who will be responsible  for the session organization in her  district. Contacts for the districts  are Pat Reinders of Deadwood Alberta,  Yvonne Synkevich of Wanham Alberta,  Annette Vickers of High Prairie Alberta, and Lorna Germaine of Dawson  Creek B.C. The Project will be coordinated jointly by the current  women's advisor Ruth Viner and the  paid project co-ordinator Alice  Butler and will operate out of the  National Farmers Union office in Dawson Creeko  At the end of the series of seminars  each district will hold a small one  day conference to consider reports  from local groups and prepare a sum-■  mary of activities to be presented  at a regional conference.  The regional conference, it is felt,  will finalize the project, provide  publicity and define its accomplishments. There are also plans to bring  a feminist speaker to the conference  to the isolated women in the Peace  a sense of the larger women's movement.  There is no doubt that the women of  the National Farmers Union have  ember 1st, five months after the proposal was submitted.

Their grant is only half that that  was needed, their area is vast, and  the project has to be launched at  the worst possible time. It was originally scheduled to run from June 1  to September 1, between seeding time  and harvest time, when the days are  long, the children out of school,  and road and weather conditions are  at their best. Unfortunately, however,  the money was not granted until Sept-  pared to drive between twenty and  forty miles every week for three  months in order to complete their  project. They feel that a delay  would destroy what enthusiasm is  left after the nine month delay they  have endured.  We wish the best of luck to all the  women involved,,and wish to commend  the previous project coordinator  Doris Jeannotte who laid much of the  groundwork for The Power Project. 14  BOOK REVIEW  STAR QUALITY  In April, 1970 Shirley MacLaine stood  in the deserted MGM studios, realized  that the old Hollywood was no more  and decided to move on. She went to  England to make a T.V. series in  which she was to play Shirley Logan,  girl photographer, with "an office  in London, a boyfriend who was anti-  establishment and a boss who wasn't,  and the conflict would be between the  two men while I (MacLaine) looked on  as arbiter and kept the peace." If  that wasn't bad enough, and it was,  Logan/MacLaine also ran an orphanage,  stuffed with children of various nationalities, to give ger a sympathetic  image which was deemed necessary "especially if you want to play one of  those independent aggressive women  who wants to operate on their own."  Not surprisingly the series was a  horrendous bomb and MacLaine went  home to campaign for George McGovern.  This venture bombed as thoroughly as  Shirley Logan, girl photographer,  through a series of misfortunes and  miscalculations; from McGovern's  credibility to Tom Eagleton's shock  treatments and some incredible ambivalence over abortion that would  strike a responsive chord up here.  So MacLaine-went to China, which was  less of a bomb and more of an explosion, shattering both her and her  twelve women companions in a way they  had not, nor could have, anticipated.  YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE (McLeod  Ltd Toronto, 1975..$8.95.) tells how  MacLaine and her diverse group,  which included a Black woman who  had a cross burned outside her house  after MacLaine visited, to a wealthy  tweedy matron, reacted to modern  China. The women, all American and  all from the generation brought up  to believe Communism the ultimate  evil, found a crime-free, hopeful,  sharing people who seemed geniunely  happy. This was difficult enough to  accept but even harder was the emergence of women from a previously serflike state to a sex-less equality  that the free-spirited Americans found  admirable but unattractive. According  to their informants, and everything  they saw seemed to confirm it, there  was no prostitution, no pre-marital  sex and no sex education in the  schools. The young people did not  "fall in love" in the Western sense  but were attracted to each other by  shared political idealogy, all made  possible by the complete lack of exploitation of sex by commercialism.  Which all sounds very restful but  the implications and logical conclusions one reaches when considering  that last sentence again are tremendous, especially I submit for Americans.  The women, feminists and non-feminists  alike, began to miss their men, and  when they found a group of Western  technicians (Chinese men not being  available) staying in their hotel,  the pleasure was instant and very  mutual,"a refuge from culture shock"  as MacLaine puts it. China was so  fundamentally different from their  way of life on the one hand, yet so  admirable particularly for women on  the other hand that they couldn't  cope.  Yet the Chinese have coped with an  absolute reversal of their lives,  easier one supposes because life was  so appalling for the majority until  the revolution. When women had their  feet bound and were slaves to their  fathers, husbands, and sons, in that  order, and husbands were expected to  beat their wives for no special  reason except they were women. In  one talk with such a family MacLaine  asked, feeling like a vaudeville  routine I suspect,"When did you stop  beating your wife?" The husband re-:  plied,"When Chairman Mao said so" —  now that's charisma.  A fascinating, thought provoking book.  MacLaine opened in Los Vegas, one  year after her return.  - Margaret Nicholls  BOOK.,  REVIEW  Images of Women, Advertising in Women's  Magazines by Trevor Milium, published  by Chatto and Windus, London, 1975,  is not a book I would recommend to  feminists.  While the book is non-sexist, it makes  only passing reference in the end to  sex role stereotyping of women by ad-  vertisments.  The first part of the book, examining  theories of the effectiveness of advertising, is probably the most in^  teresting section for laywomen.  The remainder of the book is very  dry reading — examination of photographic techniques, ego placement of  props and amount of typeface in relation to illustration.  Not much more to say.  -Karen Richardson  the avid  articler  Ms. Feb.1976. "Eight Games The System  Plays, 6r How To Psych Out The Bureaucracy" by Pringle Smith. Eight ways  the system resists changes and reform  and how we can counter-attack.  BOOK  REVIEW  WOMANHATING  Andrea Dworkin's book, Womanhating  (E.P. Dutton & Co. Inc., New York,  1974), proposes that polar sex roles  are responsible for mysogny (woman  hating) and that we must move towards  androgyny.  Dworkin offers fairy tales, porno- .  graphy, religion, witchburing, foot-  binding as major examples of woman-  hating. Starting with fairy tales,  she says we learn that women are good  when passive and bad when active.  Either way they are victims by definition, she points out.  Bad women  are punished and good women are powerless.  Dworkin makes a startling connection  between fairytales and pornography,  "We aspire to become that object of  every necrophiliac's lust, Sleeping  Beauty."  Pornography, she notes, presents women  as the image of carnality, lust, sin  and guilt which must be punished by  rape/murder. She describes it as  "psychic cannibalism* a method by  which men's power is enforced "literally over women's dead bodies."  The author goes on to establish a  connection between pornog-aphy and  religion; The 'Christian emphasis on  pain as the path rto ^salvation4shje_^,.  says is the very meat of sadomasochism  and one of the main reasons behind  the witchhunts.  Dworkin spends much time on this and  other aspects of historical gynocide  (murder of women). Some 9 million  European women died in the witchburn-  ings,along with their knowledge and  culture.  Chinese footbinding went on for 1,000  years - millions of women suffered  the "atrocity.'  The author notes that these are  overwhelming examples of gynocide.  Taken to its logical conclusion,  Dworkin says romantic love has a core  of sadism towards women, that men  love us for our vunerability and  enforce it on us physically and psychologically.  Ending with examples of androgynous  myths and startling medical proof of  human hermaphrodism, she says we can  and must break away from sex role  stereotyping.  This is Dworkin's first book, at the  age of 27, simple to read, uncomplicated, and enjoyable. I found myself  thinking that many of us could have  written this book, and wished I had.  - Karen Richardson 15  WHAT IT ALL MEANS...  EMOTIONAL SELF-DEFENCE EXPLAINED  Charlotte Atlung in the last issue of  KINESIS attempted to help readers  differentiate verbal self-defence,  emotional self-defence, and assertiveness training. In the course of allegedly "clarifying" these terms, she  grossly misunderstood and misrepresented Emotional Self-Defence.  Charlotte implies that Emotional  Self-Defence is merely a cover up  term for women too timid to attend  Assertiveness Training groups which  for Charlotte is "a more emcompass-  ing term". In fact, while Emotional  Self-Defence groups as I conduct them  (and as those who have trained with  me do) do assertiveness training,  they do not do just that. Briefly,  here are some of the.other things  that happen in an Emotional Self-  Defence Group:  1. Women learn to expand behaviour  repertoires, thereby acquiring  whichever behaviours they may be  missing that are essential for  effective human functioning —  assertiveness, self reliance,risk  taking, to be sure, but also  warmth, openness, yielding if  those are the ones that happen to  be needed.  2. Participants learn to use overworked but valued behaviours more  selectively and wisely so as to  be less vulnerable to emotional  exploitation and manipulation.  3. Women learn how to be open,,  vulnerable, and honest as well  as how to shut-down with emphasis  on recognizing the cues for which  to do, when, and with whom.  4. The benefits of co-operative  as opposed to competitive models  of being and doing are explored  (which Charlotte might benefit  from). It is unnecessary to attack  ESD or other alternate modes for  working with women in order to  promote Assertiveness Training.  As women we need to avoid using  the tactics used to oppress us on  each other.  5. Verbal Self-Defence which Charlotte also dismisses summarily is  included as well. Language can be  a weapon or a tool. In Emotional  Self-Defence groups we learn how  to avoid being controlled or provoked by others' use of language  and how instead to use words and  concepts to take the power of definition into our own hands.  More broadly, the art of Emotional  Self-Defence involves taking control  of one's life styles and defining one's  own reality in face of more and more  social pressure against doing so and  often also in the face of increasing  internal conflict, pressure and fear.  Being assertive is no protection  against pain. In fact change often  increases turmoil. ESD deals with  problems of coping and continuing to  struggle; with resisting the impulse  to collapse or retreat; with ways of  building new support systems and ways  of maintaining a sense of ground.  - Sara J. David  RESPONSE...  IN RESPONSE TO SARA DAVID  I clearly stated that one of the  differences reported to me by both  therapists and participants of Emotional Self-Defence workshops is the  difference in labels. Sara's points  about Emotional Self-Defence Groups  are valid and I feel I also cover  them in the Assertiveness Training  Workshops which I lead.  Each leader has professional freedom  to label her groups as she wishes,  but I feel that the concepts covered  are common. The method and style, of  course, is individual to each leader.  - Charlotte Atlung  QLiCC in POLiUCQL Land  We keep saying that until there are  far more women integrated into politics  at all levels, there won't be a  power base large enough to support the  lone feminists at the top. Well, here  are a few tips from an anonymous  feminist public servant, should you  land a government job.  Even if you are a political appointment  with a specific mandate, your jurisdiction may not automatically be  recognized. . The system makes you  fight to create your own territory  and then you constantly have to  defend it.  If you are like most other women,  your knowledge of the workings of  government is superficial, maybe  non-existant.  But even if you know  something about bureaucracy from  past lobbying experiences, it may take  you months just to understand the  hierarchy of the department you are  working for. Generally speaking, no  one will explain it to you when you  start work.  And there are many other difficulties.  Once you know who to deal with, when  and how, you run into the monumentally  ponderous inefficiency and immovability  of the system.  Even if you are a  branch head it will take you weeks  to get important interviews with  colleagues and superiors. You will  keep getting circular memos back  and often your requests and messages  will simply never be answered.  Once your business is on the agenda  of an important committee (if it  has to do with the status of women  it will likely be last on the list)  more 'pressing' business will come  up" and yours will be postponed  'indefinitely', not once but a  number of times0  All of this is maddeningly  frustrating but you will encounter  even more roadblocks.  On occasion  decisions will be made at the last  minutes, without prior notice,in  your absence.  You will be faced with much opposition  if you try to work collectively.  It  threatens bureacrats to share power  with women.  Some of your sisters will automatically group you with the 'enemy' once  you work in the government. If decisions are made against them, they  will assume you had something to do  with it, not understanding the system  themselves, instead of lending you  the support from which to start  changing things from the inside.  As public servant, and as a feminist,  you will need to maintain constant  contact with your peers in the  women's movement, as a lifeline of  regeneration and support, because  Victoria can be a desolate place  for a feminist.  You will also be acutely aware of  being the token feminist and you wil]  want to do everything you can to  counteract this. Ally with other  feminists in the departments if you  can find them, there are few and they  are all very busy.  In-fighting  between departments will also keep  you divided. You may nevertheless  be able to form a.political  study group.  And that's not all, but its enoughs  Are you ready to start working from  the inside?      _ Raren Richardson  quote=  "Sometimes when a little child goes  driving with his father he is allowed to hdld the ends of the reins,  and encouraged to believe that he  is driving, and it works quite well  with a very small child.

It became  clear throughout the conference that  social workers with the power of  coercive intervention are in fact  FOR OUR  of our intellectual elite.  They  are also tomorrow's parents, with only  their own parents' role-model to  follow, perpetuating and extending  the social disorder and tragedy.  From our rarified intellectuals,  we get 101 pages of law,, complete  with a lawyer to fight "for" our  children, against us; social workers,  teachers, and neighbors with a  duty to report conditions in our  homes to the authorities; judges  with jurisdiction to order "social  programs" which our legislature has  rejected.  But we get no assistance  in raising our children.  Mr. Justice Hutcheon of the Supreme  Court of B.C. said of this draft  statute:  "It would be difficult  to conceive of a scheme that would  be better designed to destroy the  CHILDREN'S SAKE  The conference itself was rather  typical of our society, a symptom  of the malaise which also produces  multiple buck-passing, bureaucratic  rigidity, and corporate impotence.  There were some 140 participants,  all of whom in some way qualify  as a "professional" to families.  Many were social workers, many  were family lawyers or judges, a  few were psychiatrists.  All paid  $50.00 to be there, or had it paid  for them.  There were no participants whose qualification was their  status as single parent, their  experience as a battered chidl,  or their own experience with successful divorce0  I was the only person  in my discussion group who dared  suggest personal knowledge of the  problems being discussed, and the  only non-panelist suggesting alternative solutions.  The malaise from which we suffer  is "professionalism", the segregation of knowledge into the experienced and the conceptualized.  Whereas conceptualized knowledge  ahs increased in value by being  written, taught, hardened and, ultimately, ossified, experiential  knowledge has been increasingly  devalued. Mas education, mass  production, and a highly developed  technology all tend to the devaluation of that which is learned  through personal experience, and  nowhere is this more apparent than  in the field of raising our young.  There were no grandparents at the  conference, no victims of the  Family Court process, no welfare  recipients, and no children in  trouble with the law. There were  no children. There were no daycare workers, very few teacher.  There were no nursing mothers, no  battered wives, and no non-custodial father. Those who incidentally  came within one of these categories  were there in a professional role  only, and carefully restricted them-  police officers withoug identification as such, and that the only  system which will protect all of  the children all of the time is the  police state. We don't need it  and don't want it, and our children will be harmed by it as much  as we the parents.  In the minds of our rarified intellectuals, there is no confidance,  in the abilities of anyone unlike  themselves. They hold that mindset which gives to the elite the  justification for forcing their  values upon others.  They ask no  guidance from the people involved  in conflict, yet presume to judge  when that conflict arises.,  They  ask what have we conceptualized to  give, rather than what is the need  and how can we meet it.  Women are demanding day-care for the  same reasons these intellectuals  are pontificating. We wish to  raise our children collectively  because we knwo these children  need access to adults other than  their parents; because parents  need time away from their children  for participation in the labor force  and public like; and because children's needs for experiential learning  extend far beyond the capacity of  even our "successful" nuclear, two-  parent families. We, too, know  that children need the nurturance  of a strong parental bond, which  cond is increasingly weakened under  the strain of exclusive respnsibi-  lity for meeting the physical and  emotional needs of our children.  Without top-quality, flexible, and  readily available day-care, we the  parents will increasingly break  under the strain of trying to do  alone that which can only be done  in community. The victims will  continue to be our children, the  young offenders, behavioural disorders, and battered-child syndrome  courts than this one." I'have  long been critical of our courts,  often critical of the judges who sit  in them.  But I agree with this  learned judge, who went on to reject  this "cup of bitter hemlock." We  aren't in Utopia, but representative  democracy and independant courts  have moved us to universal education, legalization of unions, rights  to social assistance.  We do not need to be coerced into  using more family counsellors,  psychiatrists, and family advocates.  We need access to services as of  right — services which meet the  needs of the people. We need access  to our public buildings after  3:00, child-care integrated into  flexible school systems, supervised  paly that is not all supervised  into competitive sports*. We need  places to be together with our  chidlren outside our one-bedroom  apartments, places our children can  be with othere children as well as  other adultso We need community  transportation instead of highways and  cars we cannot afford to drive.  We need access to adult education  and flexible job training; flexible  working hours and jobs we can tolerate, if not enjoy. We need control  of community television and skills  in using it. We need child psychologists we can meet in casual conversation instead of in university lectures and controlled interviews;  lawyers committed to the service of  people instead of abstruse arguments.  Utopia?  Indeed.  But unless we  correctly identify the Utopia for  which we strive, we cannot ask  whether the path we walk leads  towards our goal0 More law, more  bureaucrats, more judges masking  as counsellors — to what goal does  this path lead?  - Lee Masters  leaflet  VERBAL SELF-DEFENSE is a nine-page  leaflet produced by the Vancouver  Status of Women to help women deal  with verbal put-downs. 50c.  2029-West 4th, Vancouver  brief  Two briefs on women in unions are  available from Professor Patricia  Marchak, Dept.

All members of the committee were present —  and a few others as well. Sharon Craig  of the Roberts Creek Women's Centre  and Pat Mullin and Mary Mclntyre of  the Princeton Women's Group attended  as observers.  The most satisfying news for everyone  was that the BCFW has received a  $10,000 grant from the Secretary of  State in Ottawa to cover cost of travel  and expenses for all meetings. No  longer are we tied to having meetings  somewhere near the Lower Mainland for  'convenience's' sake and no longer  will out-of-Vancouver women have to  dig deep into their pockets to pay for  their own travel expenses. Plaudits  to Funding Organizer Mo Simpson for  whipping up a grant proposal in record  time and when the actual cheque arrives  formal thanks will go to the Secretary  of State.  A 'feasibility committee" has been  struck to investigate and organize  all aspects of travel for standing  committee meetings. The committee will  work closely with the regional representative of each area the meeting is  bcfw  EVERY TWO MONTHS A PAGE OF KINESIS  WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE B.C.

A high priority in  planning these meetings will be to ensure attendence of local women and  groups at the meeting, and to plan  mini-conferences and information  sharing sessions for that region as  much as is humanly possible over a  weekend!  Work is going ahead,on the BCFW brochure and the policy/constitution  handbook that we want to have available for all members to purchase.  Action Organizer Gail Borst presented  an excellent paper on membership organizing, and it is now in the process  of being typed out for publication.  Gail wrote it specifically for organizers of the BCFW but it is applicable  to all women's groups, .and we decided  to make it the first of what we hope  will be many discussion papers and action proposals that will be available  to women everywhere.  The Ad Hoc Committee on Bill C-72  (Human Rights Bill) presented Johanna  den Hertog of Vancouver- Status of Women who compared the federal bill to  already existing provincial human  rights acts and pointed out its deficiencies. There is much work to be  done to ensure that when the bill  gets to committee (after 2nd reading)  the correct amendments will be made.  Jay Stewart is handling BCFW's critique of this bill.  There was a discussion of sub-committees and their importance to the federation. Both Dorothy Glass (Education  Sub-committee) and Ellen Frank (Child  Care) expressed concern and disappointment over seeming lack of interest in  their sub-committees by women who had  been involved before. Over the next  two months we hope to remedy this situation and ensure new members' participation in sub-committees by making it  clear to members how they can begin  a sub-committee or participate effectively in existing groups. (Any ideas  are welcome — drop me a line.)  The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.  (after sitting for 9 hours). The next  date is tentatively set for March  27/28 in Roberts Creek.

RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN PRISON SUB-COMMITTEE  (Provisional)  One of our problems is that the committee set up, rather rapidly but  quite excitedly, at the last annual  conference, is comprised of women  living outside the Lower Mainland —  with the exception of Betsy Woods,  Marian Bailey and myself. There is  a real need for a few new members  from the Lower Mainland area and in  particular a member who could coordinate the ideas and latent energy  which are right out there but need  to be gathered in an organized way.  Please contact me if you are interested o  Claire Culhane, 3965 Pandora, North  Burnaby, 299-7178  EDUCATION SUB-COMMITTEE (Provisional)  I hope that we can begin to establish  a communication network of people  throughout the province who wish to  actively work to change the education  system so that it can truly provide  for the positive growth of female  students.  ootn rne uept. or education ana tne  B.C. Teachers' Federation have a full  time staff person working in the area  of sex discrimination. The teachers  also have a status of women contact  person in every school district in  r>ie province. If the BCFW, representing the communities, the taxpayers,  can begin concerted action for changes  in schools in each of our communities  and work with the resource people  available, there would be quite a  potential for change. All it takes is  for us to get busy — decide what we  want — and work for it!  Please contact me if you are interested in being part of this network. It  vould also help to know what your  particular interest in education is.  Dorothy Glass, Box 4, Campbell River  287-7897  ANNOUNCEMENT FROM RIGHTS OF LESBIANS  SUB-COMMITTEE  BCFW policy outlines many ways this  socie-ty discriminates against lesbians.  To effectively fight discrimination  we must work together. Only as a  group do we have the power to confront  and change the attitudes and laws  that oppress us. We need the active  support of every woman commited to  ending women's oppression.

Maybe  you can plan a conference or workshop  in your region that will spart the  interest of women in your community  and make them aware of what is happen- )  ing. Perhaps you can start joint action on needs that are of special concern, such as getting better employment  opportunities for women, bringing in  more doctors and making university  correspondence courses available. All  these can be accomplished through the  BCFW, which is an umbrella organizatiom  for women's groups in this province,  and as such, keep up the contacts,  establish the connections — and use  them. BCFW is only as strong as its  member groups — so organize. The B.C.  women's movement can't help but grow  stronger if you do!

That's how Burns Lake Women's Awareness Group members described the Women's Legal Rights Workshop their  group held in Burns Lake on December  31st.  Nearly 80 women of all ages and several interested men packed the high  school's Humanities Room to view  videotapes on Women and the Law prepared by the Vancouver People's Law  School and to hear Skeena MP Iona  Campagnolo speak on recent and proposed changes in federal legislation  affecting women.  On hand to answer questions from the  audience were resource persons Agnes  Kranz, a Prince George lawyer, Ron-  nice Gelz, Burns Lake Registrar, Beth  Stanga, Smithers Law Centre para  legal worker, and Patty Norris, Smithers Registrar. The resource persons  were kept so busy answering a barrage  of audience questions that the fourth  videotape was shelved to extend the  question period.  A lively question period also followed MP Iona Campagnolo's remarks. Ms.  Campagnolo gave a run down on the  recently passed "Omnibus Bill on the  Status of Women" and on upcoming  legislation of particular interest  to women. She praised groups like  Women's Awareness Group and issued a  call for women to search out and encourage other competent women to--- —-  I8dT-ec8 «Sn-±aso:rD isfcbeV e££ xo3  compete for higher level positions  and to run for local office. She urged  the audience to support frmale candidates and to lobby for passage of  legislation such as C-72, the Human  Rights Bill.  On the question of abortion, Ms.  Campagnolo warned of the strength of  anti-abortion lobbies and read the  Quebec Advisory Council on the Status  of Women's recommendations on abortion reform, suggesting that this  would most probably be the compromise  plan accepted.  While the audience had lunch and  listened to videotapes and speakers,  some fifteen children enjoyed the  movies, snacks and games nearby under  the supervision of Debbie McLachlan,  day care co-ordinator of the new Burns  Lake Day Care Society. Many mothers  indicated that the free day care had  enabled them to attend the workshop.  And, as one mother pointed out, "It  was certainly easier to concentrate!"

Write  Box 1019 Station "Q", Toronto, Ont. 21  cnc Pai_L.cn uuorncn  One hundred years ago the fight against  the iniquitous Contagious Diseases Act  was carried from England to the Continent.  In 1875 the International Abolitionist Federation was formed and in  1877 the first International Congress  was held in Geneva.  In England, under the Contagious Diseases law, women who were prostitutes  had no civil rights. They could be  picked up by the police, jailed, forcibly examined — with no recourse to  law or justice. This, Josephine Butler  contended, was not only unjust to women, but demoralizing for women, for  men, for the police, and for society  as a whole.  Prostitutes were looked upon as  "fallen women", "women of sin" and  "immoral", but the men who used them  had no stigma attached to them and no  reason to fear the law.  Josephine Butler recognized that  "economics lie at the very root of  practical morality" and that an  unjust law is more anti-social than  immorality.  'Women's Libbers' are accustomed to  being vilified, their ideas and principles misinterpreted and misunderstood;  as is anyone who fights for a minority  cause or for freedom and justice for  everyone, in the real sense of those  over-abused words.  To Nineteenth Century English society  it was appalling that women should  take up the cudgels for "common prostitutes." They were referred to as  the "shrieking sisterhood", "a clique  of perambulating legislators", "wanton  nastiness"; their words as "hysterical  clap trap", "reckless falsehood".  How familiar it sounds! The suffragettes  suffered the same vilification; as have  people who take an anti-war stand or  defend other unpopular minority beliefs.  To have public discussion on the causes  of prostitution, on the inequalities  and injustices of an economic system  that produced such social conditions,  was unpardonable, and these women who  formed the National Association and  the Ladies' National Association for  the Abolition of the State Regulation  of Vice, were upbraided and excoriated  by those Srespectable'men and women who  benefitted by this law.  'Upper class1 women were protected.  The double moral standard left men  free to take advantage of prostitutes,  and the prostitutes were the ones who  were discriminated against and left  helpless victims of an unjust law.  The supporters of the Contagious  Diseases Acts contended that they  reduced disease, kept prostitution  within the limits where it could be  controlled and that they exercised a  "restraining and reformative effect"  on the women concerned.  Abolitionists maintained that prostitution increased disease, as no system  of inspection could "render women immune from disease."  The system led to corruption of police  and "clandestine prostitution."  This historic struggle to have the  Contagious Diseases Act withdrawn,  culminated in success, after a prolonged  controversy that involved people from  all walks of life.  Josephine Butler and her courageous  group had support and followers from  the "well born" (as they were called  in those days), to the working class—  mostly the latter, partly because it  was from their ranks that prostitutes  came, due to shockingly low wages.  Final abolition in Britain came in  1886,.but not before the Government,  alarmed at the strength of the Abolitionist Movement, introduced in 1872  a bill "designed to concede a great  deal while remaining firmly regulation-  ist".  Josephine Butler and a few others rejected this compromise, seeing that  it was an effort to split the Abolitionists, and finally won the day.  Subsequently, success was achieved in  Europe and India, and so the long  fight to have prostitutes recognized  as people got a foothold and paved  the way for more reforms.  But reform is all that has been  achieved; and all that will be  achieved in this writer's estimation  until we abolish the economic systems  that give rise to this and other  forms of prostitution that exist.  People still sell their souls and  their knowledge for a mess of pot-  age, and will so long as money is  the guiding light in our society.  - Eve Smith  PROSTITUTION IN B.C.

'   -WCWN M° n3 22  members'     forum  DISCRIMINATION?  I'd like to comment on the article  by Jo Lazenby in the last KINESIS:  The Housing Game...We Lose.  Discrimination is a cancer of society,  killing and crippling, just as much  as the real disease. Iknow too much  about it, having dealt with it all  my life — discrimination that is.  But I'd like to go a little deeper  into the question, whether it is a  real discrimination to ban children  from apartment blocks, and whether  it is only against the single parent;  for I have had just as much trouble  in this direction as a couple parent,  and there are many others that I know  of.  Please, let noone be angry if I want  to present the other side of the coin.  Because I, myself, would not want to  live in an apartment where children  are allowed, and I am not the only  one, and we are not mean and discriminating either.  Then why not? Just let me explain.  It is impossible to satisfactorily  mix parents-with-kids (single or  otherwise) with (ex)-parents -without-  kids in one apartment block. But, I  will let you know how I_ feel about  this. We all know that the apartment  blocks are a necessary evil, and that  the experiences and pleasures of in  dividual housing are for most of us,  a thing of the past. We live on top  of each other, beside each other,  underneath each other, too often much  too close for comfort. This calls for  consideration, thoughtfullness.^of  others, goodwill.  But.let's face it, the days of discipline, healthy punishment for youthful misdemeanors, freedom (instead  of licence) are over, definitely, anti  forever. Some of us, earnest and hardworking, goodwilling people, be they  single or married, are trying courageously to hang onto these "outdated"  sneered-at concepts. It is difficult  enough for couple parents to keep  track of the comings, goings, outdoor behaviour (which is quite different from outdoor behaviour, did you  know?) of their children, and make  them benefit from a healthy measure  of care and discipline, and I can  understand how difficult it is for  someone who has to be mom and dad in  one. But there are too many parents  who don't give a damn, are abusive  and ignorant themselves, and in most  cases, so are the kids. I have seen  it, heard it, experienced it so many  times that I feel quite free to make  this statement.  And it is from that last category  landlords feel they have to protect  themselves and the tenants. He does  not know how you and your kids behave  when you come to his door, all smiles  and polish, to rent his apartment.  He can't know. People are deceptive  when they want something. I_ want to  steer clear from the rowdy ones too,  without having to find out the hard  way first. At this point in my life,  I have no patience with the foulmouth-  ed, abusive little darlings! ("My  Johnny or Betsy never does a thing  like that!!"Haven't you heard it?)  Especially after all the pain and  effort I put into raising my own  children, onto a decent citizen level.  And I'm happy to say that they are  ailright, in spite of often very  cramped housing and/or shortage of  money.  Children need a place to live. With  their parents. There should be places  for family living. No effort to establish these should be spared.  But I have rights too. A bit of peace  and quite in the best way possible  after a hard day on my feet amongst  sick and abused people. There are  many like me.  Then I ask myself, who is it then,  who is discriminated against? Is it  discrimination, stupid and blatant,  or reasoning, when it says somewhere:  "No Kids"?  - Stella Goudsmid  WOMEN IN CHINA  Trips to China are no longer as rare  as they once were. Almost everybody  knows somebody who has visited the  Peoples' Republic. As a consequence,  more and more articles about daily  life in revolutionary China are  appearing in newspapers and magazines  throughout North America. And  usually included, is some mention  of the role played by Chinese  women in their society.  Well, what more can one person add?  What new observations can be made?  We have already been told what  equality of the sexes means in  China.  For all intents and purposes,  women receive equal pay for equal  work. What small discrepancies  might exist in some parts of China  are rapidly being eliminated by  raising the salaries of women.  During my one month trip in five  Chinese cities, including Shanghai,  Wuhan, Shihchichuang, Tiensin and  Peking, I saw women performing all  types of jobs from blast furnace  worker in a steel mill to attendant  in a day care centre. In fact, in  contrast to the oil refinery on the  Canadian $ bill, a woman driving  a tractor appears on one denomination  of Chinese paper currency.  Recognizing their differences,  certain provisions are made for  women throughout their working  career: women are given lighter  jobs than usual each month during  menstruation, during pregnancy women  work a 7 hour as opposed to an 8  hour day, at the time of childbirth,  women receive 56 days off with pay  and are returned to the job that  they left at the end of that time.  A  two week rest period from work accompanies all abortions, which are  free and accessible to all women.  Day cafe centres are, of course,  situated throughout China and are  often attached to factories or  plants so that parents can visit  their children during lunch hour or  breaks. Very often, I observed  fathers taking or picking their  children up from the day care  centre.  It was explained to me by  some representatives of the-Womens'  Federation that this is common  practice and in many cases, it is  the father who takes the children  to the day care centre at his  factory.  In contrast to working mothers in our  society, after having worked an 8  hour day in China, the woman is not  expected to come home and also play  the traditional womans' role of home-  maker.  Inexpensive restaurants,  more like large family kitchens  have been established where a  family can go and have a meal  together without the woman having  to prepare it.  These and other kinds of facilities  exist everywhere for women in China.  They have been truly emancipated and,  as independent income earners, no  longer need to be subservient or  submissive to any man. Their  security is not left to the whim  of any individual.  There are, of course, many questions  and struggles yet to be raised and  waged by women in China.  But  certainly no one is more aware of  this than those women concerned.  They don't need us to point  directions.  But, of all the things that I  learned from the women in China,  there is one that stands out foremost in my mind. And perhaps it is  the unusual, but certainly not  original, perspective that I can  bring to you in this article.  And that is, that the class struggle  comes before all else. That women can  not become liberated in a capitalist  society. And that it is men and  women together who must first solve  the major contradiction in society:  that between the working class and  the bougeois class, before satisfactory resolutions can be found to  other problems.  The Chinese women  that I met during my visit to the  Peoples' Republic, stressed this  point constantly. And it is one,  I think, that all North Americans  interested in womens' liberation  must deal with.  -Paula Davies.
