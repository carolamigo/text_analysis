KINESIS ////////////////////^^^^  ////////////////////////////^^^^^  news  Reproductive technology  Royal Commission is  a volatile mix  by Nancy Pollak  Any misgivings feminists had  about the hazards of a Royal Commission on reproductive technology were confirmed late October when the commissioners were  formally appointed by the Prime  Minister's Office.  The idea of a Royal Commission, advocated by some feminists  and severely criticized by others,  was embraced by the Conservatives last spring as a means of addressing public concerns about a  range of issues relating to human  reproduction (see box).  The newly appointed commissioners—five women and two men  -are, for the most part, strangers  to the feminist health community.  Equally significant, there appears  to be no representation from the  groups who have most to fear from  reproductive technologies: infertile  women, people with disabilities,  and women of colour.  Heading the Royal Commission  Dr. Patricia Baird, a pediatrician and former chief of the  Department of Medical Genetics at the University of British  Columbia.  The commission's controversial  appointees are Maureen McTeer,  Suzanne Scorsone and Louise Van-  delac.  An unsuccessful Conservative  candidate in last November's election and wife of External Affairs minister Joe Clark, Maureen McTeer's pro-choice stance  abortion made her an instant  target for anti-choice politicians.  The government, first stating  that abortion was not within the  scope of the Royal Commission,  then hastily defended McTeer's  appointment by contrasting it  with Suzanne Scorsone's.  The director of the Office of  Catholic Family Life for the archdiocese of Toronto, Scorsone toes  an orthodox Catholic Une: anti-  choice and anti-contraception. She  is also known to oppose any experimentation with embryos and/or  fetal tissue.  Louise Vandelac is, from a feminist perspective, the good news.  A teacher of women's studies at  the University of Quebec in Montreal, Vandelac is a leading critic  of reproductive technologies and  possesses a solid analysis of patriarchy's defining role in reproduction.  Universities and the medical establishment are well-represented.  Other appointees include: Dr.  Bruce Hatfield, a professor of  medecine at the University of  Calgary; Martin Hebert, a Montreal specialist in medical law and  bioethics; and Grace Janzten, a  teacher of the philosophy of religion at the University of London,  England.  (Janzten is more of an unknown  quantity than the others: she has  hved outside Canada for at least  the last ten years.)  The commissioners are a volatile  mix and some observers are already wondering how such a Royal  Commission can ever work. The  appointments are political, with  names selected by the Prime Minister's Office from lists provided by  various ministers: health, justice,  and status of women, among others.  A government source reports  that the Tories were inundated  with requests by individuals who  wanted to serve. The government,  lobbied hard by both feminists  and anti-abortion groups, had flip-  flopped on the idea of a Royal  Commission, fearing it would turn  into a debate on abortion.  Feminists have that  concern,  man hfe and, as such, a threat  to women's self-determination and  human dignity.  In an interview with Kinesis,  Dr. Patricia Baird described the  technologies as "a Pandora's box  that has been opened, and will  not go away." The commission's  role, she said, is to seek information and make recommendations  guided by "common sense and humanity ... we will be maximizing  personal choice for the individual  without violating Canadian societal values."  Baird described women's rights  What they'll study  The Royal Commission on Reproductive Technology has been mandated to examine the social, legal, medical, ethical and economic implications of new reproductive technologies and, at the end of it two-year  term, to make recommendations to guide public policy.  The commission will study, among other things:  • artificial insemination • in vitro fertilization • embryo transfers (moving an embryo from one women's body to another's) ♦ surrogacy ♦ genetic engineering (manipulating genetic codes to ehminate "defects") •  sex determination and pre-selection technologies • fetal tissue transplants  (using embryonic cells in disease treatments) • causes of and treatments  for infertility  too. Joy Thompson, a Vancouver  feminist health advocate, sees the  Royal Commission as an opportunity for right-wing forces to publicly argue for legal rights for the  fetus—in the guise of children's  rights.  Having women's rights limited  by so-called fetal rights is only one  potential danger from this Royal  Commission. Many feminists view  reproductive technologies as an inherently sexist manipulation of hu-  We're Talking About Choice, Ottawa  The sun was shining when Vancouver women, men and children turned out in droves for the October 14  National Day of Action on abortion. Along with thousands of other Canadians in other towns and cities,  we reminded the federal government that no new law on abortion is required. The Tories have promised to  introduce new legislation before year's end.  Linda Ervin (above), spokesperson for the BC Coalition of Abortion Clinics, also reminded Ottawa that the  Canada Health Act should be used to enforce equal access to abortion across the country. Full funding of  abortion clinics, such as Vancouver's Everywoman's Health Centre, was demanded of the Socreds.  Since the Daigle injunction fiasco of last summer, pro-choice groups have enjoyed significant increases in  membership. Kinesis readers are urged to do their bit to ensure politicians feel the heat of the pro-choice  majority. Letters demanding there be no new abortion law should be sent to: Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,  Justice Minister Doug Lewis, and Health Minister Perrin Beatty. Write to them, postage-free, at the Parliament  Buildings, Ottawa, Ontario KlA 0A2.  in the context of reproductive  technologies as "very important  ... but also important are the  rights of the children who are the  outcome. They're also involved—  and the partners of the women are  involved, as are their brothers or  sisters and parents who are, after  all, potential grandparents."  Baird's professional back  ground—as medical geneticist and  doctor—holds no comfort for wo  men concerned about the expansion of reproductive technologies.  "When you have academics in  the field, their professional interests and those of their colleagues are involved," says Connie Clement, a Toronto-based feminist health activist who opposed  the call for the Royal Commission.  "It's in her [Baird's] interests—  and it will feel safe and normal to  her— for there to be continuance.  "Her frame of reference will see  reproductive technologies as intrinsically beneficial."  Clement's opposition to the  feminist Coalition for a Royal  Commission on Reproductive  Technologies—also Toronto-based  — was rooted in the fact that  similar commissions (in Australia  and England) have failed to dehver  pro-women recommendations. As  well, Clement and her colleague  Diana Majury beheve the Canadian femimst community has yet  to hold the grassroots discussions  needed to mobilize an effective response.  Margrit Eichler, a prime mover  (with Maureen McTeer) in the  pro-commission Coalition, describ  ed her reaction to the appointments as "not ecstatic, of course.  We don't know most of them."  Eichler, a Toronto sociologist, is  pleased the commission will investigate the economic impact of the  technologies.  "That's very, very important.  Now, an explicit part of the question will be 'who's making a  profit?' "  Royal Commissions have at  their disposal millions of dollars  for research, and Eichler sees this  Commission as a golden opportunity for primary research that  might otherwise not occur. "We  could do follow-up studies on  women in fertility programs, or investigate the effects of ultra-sound  on children. We could ask our own  questions."  Access to research money was  one of the Coalition's main arguments for a Royal Commission. The route to that money  is through the commission's research director—a person the commissioners will soon hire.  Money will indeed be an issue for feminists. As Clement says,  "There are two parts to a Royal  Commission: making a presentation, then lobbying the commission to make sure your recommendations are accepted."  Feminists usually manage to  make the presentations (often  based on volunteer research and  labour), but, says Clement, "we  lose it in the lobbying end. And the  reproductive technology industries  will have professionally written  and researched reports, and lots  of resources for the follow-up lobbying." Both Clement and Eichler  beheve feminist groups should immediately start lobbying the commission for funds.  No amount of funds falling into  femimst hands, however, will offset one of the commission's worst  deficiencies: the lack of representation of the people who are affected  by reproductive technologies.  "There is no one who is identified as dealing with infertility—the  consumer," says Clement. As well,  there is no one identified as having a disabihty (genetic engineering often involves eliminating genetic "defects," a concept that is  oppressive to people with disabilities), and no women of colour.  "While at present in Canada,  reproductive technology is mainly  available to white, middle-class  women," says Clement, "its implications will impact on poor  women, through baby-buying, surrogacy and the selling of body  parts."  Housing is a  feminist issue  Residents of Vancouver need no  reminding that the city is in the  grip of a serious housing crisis. In  response, the Vancouver Status of  Women is organizing an information evening on Monday, November 20 to address some of the issues facing women and children.  Information, advice and strate-  gizing will be the order of the  evening. Speakers include Rita  Chudnovsky, the Children's Advocate for Vancouver; Bernice Saunders of South Vancouver Neighbourhood House; Carolyn McCool  of Legal Services; and Noreen  Shanahan, of the Tenants' Rights  Association.

KINESIS Across B.C.  \N\X\XXNNNNNNXX\\X\\X\XN\NXXN\N\X\X^^  In Comox  Pensions, job security at heart of strike  by Leslie Kenny  On Vancouver Island, tensions  are running high over a labour dispute at the privately-owned Comox Medical Chnic. Twelve of the  chnic's staff, all women, have been  on strike since October 5 when  talks broke down while bargaining  for a first contract.  "Lack of job security and lack  of a pension plan were the main  reasons for unionizing," said  steward Donna Messer, "[But] negotiations broke down over the basic principles of seniority— which  the doctors refused to recognize—  closed shop and contracting out."  The women were certified in  January 1989 with local 1518 of  the United Food and Commercial  Workers Union. The significance of  the strike is heightened by the fact  that the Comox women are the  only unionized chnic staff in the  province. Their actions are setting  a precedent that carries a strong  message to the B.C. Medical Association and to the many other  women who staff private chnics in  B.C.  The striking women comprise  clerical staff, nurses, and cleaning staff. Wages are a concern,  with office workers earning $8.26  - $9.81/hour and the head nurse  earning $12.80/hour compared to  the entry rate at unionized hospitals of $15-$17/hour. Two of the  women have been employed by the  chnic for over 14 years, while several others have worked there for  10 or more years.  "We've tried for years to communicate our concern about pensions and job security," Messer  said, "but they never wanted to hsten to us. They didn't give a damn.  We were told 'if you don't hke  it here, we can easily replace you  with the next person who comes in  off the street.'  "Last December, a lady retired  from here after 20 years of service  with no pension. We think we're  better than that."  Another woman on the hne,  a receptionist for 14 years, said  "things got much worse after we  unionized. Work started going out  of the office; we saw it happening.  They advertised a job in the paper  for an office manager, but none of  us were told about it, so none of  us applied.  "They wanted a union breaker.  We were told by this new office  manager that all of our jobs were  to be revamped, and that there  would be layoffs, but when, they  didn't know."  The chmate in B.C. for employees seeking a first contract is  generally not very favourable. Joy  McPhail of the B.C. Federation  of Labour cites Bill 19—the Industrial Relations Act (HtA) enacted by the Socreds in 1987—  as being "a grossly unfair piece  of legislation that shifts the power  For girls  Rugby made hard to play  by Terrie Hamazaki  The issue of sex discrimination  in highschool sports was stirred up  last month when a female student  in Vancouver made her school's  rugby team.  In early September, Anne-Marie  Lookman, a grade ten student  at David Thompson Secondary  School, tried out for and was accepted to the junior rugby team.  She was the only female.  Pleased that her involvement  in the sport was supported by  friends, teammates and teachers,  Anne-Marie Lookman was surprised to hear rumours she would  be removed from the team.  Said her mother, Cherie Look-  man, "She came home one day  from school looking very upset,  and said that it was definite ...  she was told by her school principal that she could no longer play".  Cherie Lookman pursued the  matter further.  "I called Mr. Rossi [the school  principal]," she said, "and he  talked about the Vancouver Secondary School Athletic Association (VSSAA) having a constitution which states that only males  are allowed to play rugby, soccer  and hockey."  The VSSAA, operating under  the  auspices  of  the  Vancouver  School Board (VSB), is run by  teachers and is responsible for secondary school athletics.  Under the VSSAA's constitution, five sports are single-sex designated sports: field-hockey, gymnastics, and softball are for females; rugby and wresthng are for  males.  Said Cherie Lookman, "If the  only reason Anne-Marie couldn't  play is because she's a girl... then  I was going to pursue this."  She spoke with Pauline Weinstein, VSB trustee, after receiving  no resolution at the District Superintendent level. Weinstein advised her to make an appeal to the  school trustees at their upcoming  meeting.  Before that meeting, however,  the VSSAA polled their Board  of Governors—secondary school  principals— decided there was  room for re-thinking, and changed  their vote to allow Anne-Marie to  play.  Said Jim Appleby of the VSSAA, "History tends to dominate  the rules ... and we're bending  the rules to allow her to play.  Rugby is a contact sport and we  don't tend to condone male and female participation."  At their general meeting in  November, the VSSAA executive  will put forward a motion that  reads, according to Appelby, "that  any student has the option of playing those sports that are single-  sex designated. We are looking at  changing the rules and we don't  expect the motion to be overturned."  Appleby added that the VSSAA  has concerns about "reverse discrimination."  "We don't want to see boys then  taking over other sports which are  primarily girls' sports."  Weinstein is pleased with the  VSSAA's move. "H the principals were really opposed to a  girl playing rugby, they would not  have changed their vote [for Anne-  Marie]. Assuming this is cleared  locally, the next step is to go  provincially."  The VSB will be recommending  to the B.C. Schools Athletic Association that they get rid of the  clause in their constitution which  prohibits teams with girl players  from competing in the B.C. championships.  For Anne-Marie, whose talents  in judo earned her a silver medal  at the B.C. Winter games in 1988,  the week-long furor at the end of  September only interfered in her  desire to play rugby.  "I didn't know what the fuss  was about. I love sports ... what's  wrong with that?" she said.  completely over to the employers."  McPhail added "It's particularly  difficult for newly unionized employees since a lot of the rights  the workers could claim while bargaining for a first contract are no  longer there. The IRA gives employers the right to bargain unfairly."  Sharon Edwards, business agent  for local 1518, expressed concern  about the effects of the legislation. "We ended up laying charges  at the Industrial Relations Council  Anne-Marie Lookman won a silver medal in judo at last year's  B.C. Winter Games.  We've tried for  years to  communicate our  concern...  (IRC) against the doctors for bargaining in bad faith and for unfair  labour practices. This was over the  doctors' stalling us out in negotiations, contracting work out of the  office, and hiring out of seniority.  "The hearing was held in Vancouver. We were able to get them  to agree to negotiate on consecutive days. But apart from the legal  cost to the doctors and the time  lost traveUing, nothing else came  of it. I would be very reluctant to  accept mediation from the IRC."  As a protest against the labour  legislation, B.C. unions have been  boycotting the IRC since its inception and have used private mediation services instead.  Speaking for the six doctors  who manage the clinic, Don Fock-  ler disputed allegations made by  the union. "The union is using tactics and making statements which  are not based in reality. We have  never laid anyone off, or fired anyone, though we've had reason to  do so...our wage scale is as good or  better than any office in the area."  A statement issued by the Comox Valley Women's Resource  Centre regarding the strike criticized the way labour issues are  clouded by assumptions about  women's role in the family as "secondary" income earners. "[We]  support the women's action for  fair wages, regardless of the employee's relationships or financial  circumstances outside the workplace," said the Centre.  Given the present stalemate,  the onus is falling on members  of the community to exercise  their conscience in patronizing the  chnic, which is operating with the  help of the doctor's wives.  Out on the picket hne, Donna  Messer says "Some people have to  go on—older people with medications, or people with sick kids—  and we accept that." She added  that the union is requesting that  patients use the hospital emergency or go to other doctors until  the strike is resolved.  "People keep talking about how  militant we're being, but of the 9  of us out here today, 7 of us are  grandmothers. I ask you, how militant can a bunch of grandmothers  be?"  A KINESIS SSSSS//SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SS/S  ///////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////////^^^^  Across Canada  They are Canada's department store  Eaton's guilty of sex discrimination  by Joni Miller  Sometimes winning feels hke losing—as  Elaine Cook found out after succeeding in  a sexual discrimination case this summer  against Eaton's. "What good is a moral victory," she said, "when nothing changes?"  Cook, a 21-year veteran of Eaton's, is 56.  She launched a suit with the B.C. Human  Rights Council after being passed over for a  commission sales position in the appliance  department in favour of a man who had  been with the company for three months. "I  was told they hired him to 'keep harmony  in the department',"Cook said. The department is all male. For Cook, the incident was  the last straw in a long history of on the job  harassment.  Eaton's was ordered to pay $2,000 in  damages for "embarrassment, injury to feelings and loss of dignity" and to hire Cook  for the next vacancy in their large appliance  department at the Warehouse Store in East  ancouver.  It could be a long wait. "I've looked at  that department," said Cook. "I can't foresee anyone leaving for the next five years.  It's been suggested that I should move to  another store—but why should I? I'm the  longest employee in this store." She currently works in the ladies wear department,  a position that nets her around $23,000 a  year. An appliance salesman makes between $30-$35,000.  David Mossop, the lawyer who represented Cook, said the $2,000 settlement represented the maximum award under current regulations. "I know Elaine is disappointed," he said, "but it was an important  moral victory for women." The Cook v.s.  the T.E. Eaton case is considered a landmark decision.  A representative from Eaton's remains  adamant that no sexual discrimination took  place. "This is not a case of a large corporation not giving a hoot in hell," said Pat  Jones, the market personnel manager for  the B.C. Mainland. "We've agonized and  tried very hard to accomodate Elaine."  According to Jones, what Cook perceived  as sexual discrimination was a simple case of  personality conflict. "It's a tough business,"  Jones said. "You must be able to get along.  It's the nature of commission selling." During the hearing, Eaton's produced witnesses  who alleged that Cook was "unable to get  along with her co-workers."  Douglas J. Wilson, the Human Rights official who presided over the case, saw it differently. In his ruhng he states, "I find that  Cook has established a prima facie case of  discrimination and that her sex was a significant factor in the discriminatory conduct."  Jones, who identified herself as a feminist insists, "In spirit, we're very interested  in getting women in [as commissioned salespeople]."  Wilson found, however, that "None of  the witnesses for Eaton's indicated that any  measures were taken to recruit women as  commissioned salespersons other than posting the vacancies in the store."  When questioned about Eaton's hiring  pohcies, Jones indicated that while seniority is considered, having the best skills for  the job is the deciding factor. The man who  was hired instead of Cook had, said Jones,  many years of "expert experience" in appliances. Jones referred several times to the  1986 Human Rights Council hearing where  Cook's case was originally dismissed for lack  of evidence.  The current ruhng is the result of three  years of subsequent legal wrangling. David  Mossop launched an appeal to the Supreme  Court in 1987 in a successful bid to have  the original dismissal overturned. Justice  Wood of the Supreme Court ruled that the  Human Rights Council "did not apply the  proper standard when it ordered that the  proceedings in this case should be discontinued." Wood ordered a hearing to take place,  and in this second round Eaton's was found  guilty.  Cook's story spans many years. She began at Eaton's in 1968 as a part-time  cashier, became a full-time employee in 1973  and was put in charge of stereos and vac  uum cleaners, earning a wage plus commission. In 1980, she moved to furniture at the  invitation of the department manager. "He  felt there should be a woman in the department."  Cook soon regretted the move. "It didn't  take long before the harassment started,"  she said. Cook stresses that not all of her  co-workers were involved in the direct harassment but adds, "I didn't have a friend  in that department—not among the men."  Two of the salesmen were particularly  crude. "I was told to f—off—to suck air—  if I approached customers it would be hke  'get out of here or I'll kick your ass.'  "They couldn't stand to see me make a  sale. They started to cover things with sold  tags and hold tags and if I asked for information it was 'f— off."  By 1984, Cook had had enough. "I  couldn't take it anymore. My sales started  to drop. You could just feel that tension and  I knew it wasn't going to get better."  Complaints to the personnel department  proved fruitless. Cook was told to shake  hands and get along—or go somewhere else.  In 1985 she arranged a transfer to appliances. "There was a very fine manager in  the appliance department. He saw what was  going on. I went to him and asked if there  would be an opening and he took me in."  This particular manager injured himself  shortly afterwards and did not return to  the job. The manager who replace him, in  Cook's words, "Started coming down on  me—trying to restrict my sales. The feedback from the men was that I was taking  their sales."  Cook was limited to selling small appliances—except on Sundays when she was allowed to sell the larger items. "I was dealing with the $39 kettles and toasters. Here I  was on commission, and I wasn't allowed to  sell anything larger than a vacuum cleaner."  Commissioned seUers work with a system  called "the draw." They are expected to seU  up to an established level to make their pay,  but if they are short on<-, week, the company  wUl carry them. EventuaUy, despite working fuU time, Cook found herself $12,000 in  debt to Eaton's.  "When you start making less than your  draw, there's something wrong," Cook said,  "but the problem wasn't me."  It was strongly suggested to Cook by  management that she go onto a straight  salary, which she eventually did. However,  Cook said, "I enjoyed the freedom of commission selling and I hked the contact with  the customers. I felt I was a good sales  lady." When the appliance position became  available, Cook immediately applied—the  move which led her into court.  LegaUy vindicated but unsatisfied, Cook  is now seeking others with similar experiences. "I just picked up the phone book and  started looking under 'women'." she said. "I  can't give up. What happened to me isn't  right."  Is Rosemary Brown headed for CACSW?  by Nancy Pollak  Rosemary Brown, a longstanding feminist on the British Columbian and federal  scenes, has been recommended by several  immigrant and visible minority women's  groups to head the Canadian Advisory  CouncU on the Status of Women (CACSW).  The president's position has been vacant  since September when Sylvia Gold stepped  down after her five-year term.  Created in 1973 in response to the  Royal Commission on the Status of Women,  CACSW advises the federal government on  a range of pohcy matters, such as pensions  and farmly law.  AU CACSW members are pohtical appointees, approved by the federal cabinet. Appointees are selected by the Prime  Minister's Office from hsts forwarded by  various ministers—notably Barbara McDougall, minister responsible for the status  of women.  Community groups and individuals often  try to influence the process by putting forward a "candidate" and the Vancouver Society on Immigrant Women and the Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of B.C.  have done just that with Rosemary Brown.  Of Jamaican origin, Brown has worn a  number of caps in public hfe. A founder of  the Vancouver Status of Women, she served  a term as the endowed chair in Women's  Studies at Simon Fraser University in 1987.  Brown was an NDP MLA for 14 years in  B.C. and ran for the leadership of the federal NDP in the 70s. She has been active  in a number of international bodies and, at  present, is director of Match International,  a development organization working with  women in the Third World.  Brown's understanding of the issues facing immigrant women and women of colour  has made her the choice of the Vancouver  Society on Immigrant Women.  "It's time to have someone [heading  CACSW] who is sensitive to these issues,"  said coordinator Parvin Partovi. "It's time  now for a change."  The change might not come. There are  strong, unwritten traditions surrounding  CACSW's top appointment: that the president be thoroughly bilingual—EngUsh and  French—and that appointments wUl alternate between the anglophone and francophone communities.  By these standards, CACSW is due for a  francophone president.  The Immigrant and Visible Minority  Women of B.C. are impUcitly challenging  this view with Brown's nomination.  "We have three reasons for recommending Rosemary Brown," said president  Mobina Jaffer. "We want a woman from  the west. We want a woman who reflects  new reaUties, that Canadians are not just  of EngUsh or French [descent]. And she's a  woman of colour."  Rosemary Brown  Other women's organizations are supporting the recommendation of Brown. According to a spokesperson at the Vancouver Status of Women, "We're supporting  [BrowD] as president of CACSW because  she will bring the voice of women of colour  into the centre of that organization."  The immigrant women's community has  had its complaints about the Advisory  CouncU. A 1988 councU report entitled Immigrant Women in Canada: A Policy  Perspective drew fire from the National  Organization of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of Canada (NOIVMWC).  Citing a lack of consultation, NOIVMWC  found the conclusions of the report sufficiently flawed they demanded it be withdrawn from circulation (see Kinesis March  The councU did not agree to their request.  The business of appointing a new  CACSW head wUl soon be over. In late October, a spokesperson in the Prime Minister's Office confirmed that, sometime in  November, a single name wUl be put before  cabinet.  A decision is expected by month's end.  KINESIS Across Canada  m  A busy centre in a northern city  by Paddy Doherty  As director of the Prince George Sexual  Assault Centre, Lorraine HUland hves and  breathes sexual abuse.  She first became acquainted with sexual  abuse when she was assaulted as a young  chUd. Scenes of her own abuse come back  from her earUest memory. Lorraine beheves  there was abuse before that time as weU.  She grew up with the emotional scars  common to miUions of other sexual abuse  victims: low self-esteem, emotional dependencies, promiscuity, guilt, anger and self-  destructiveness.  A mother at 15, and a mother of three by  18,—her youngest died — she married and  separated, hved common-law, left the relationship... her hfe was one relationship followed by another with never a break in between. She'd always have a new man lined  up before she left the old one.  In the early 80's Lorraine began talking  with her daughter-in-law Karen about her  abuse. Not surprisingly,—considering one  in four women in Canada have been sexuaUy assaulted—Karen had a similar background. Together they attended a workshop  on sexual abuse taught by Linda HaUiday.  Another   workshop  on   prevention  by  Lorraine Hilland  Chris Leachman convinced them there  should be resources in the community for  sexual abuse victims.  In the spring of 1984 they ran an ad in the  local paper, hired an answering service and  started their first support group. Enough  members joined to form a society and by  year's end, the society had rented an apartment and was running three groups.  Up to that point aU work had been done  by volunteers. They received a $3,000 grant  from the Lions, and then $15,000 from the  city of Prince George. Then Lorraine quit  her ten-year government job and became director of the society.  Through her involvement in a support  group, Connie Vince joined Lorraine as an  employee of the society. They rented a suburban house to hold the expanding office  and programs of the Sexual Assault Centre  and began running Wednesday night bingos.  They've been getting most of their funding  this way ever since.  The Sexual Assault Centre now hosts numerous programs throughout the year including training for facilitators, personal  growth workshops, and a yearly conference  on sexual abuse issues for northern B.C.  The centre is busy. Ten groups run  weekly with three groups running simultaneously some nights. There is a teen group  for girls, an adult men's group, and two  part-time counsellors for one-on-one counseling with very young chUdren.  The centre employs three fulltime and  two part-time workers who perform clerical  duties as weU. Each week the centre serves  an average of 100 people plus about 72  women who attend support groups.  Services generaUy take the form of counselling for victims of chUd sexual abuse and  rape. Lorraine and Connie regularly attend  court sessions to support victims charging  their offenders. They often find themselves  working with offenders since, as Lorraine  states, offenders are usuaUy victims too.  The Sexual Assault Centre's budget now  runs at $125,000, of which $85,000 is raised  by the centre itself. The remaining shortfaU  is made up from grants and donations. Recently the Ministry of Social Services and  Housing aUocated $35,000 specificaUy for  chUdrens' programs.  Like many people who are successful in  the helping fields, Lorraine finds herself  working long hours doing bookwork, making grant appUcations and lobbying for government funding. She regrets having httle  time to work directly with survivors and  their famines, but understands the value of  her administrative talents.  Lorraine feels she has done her work on  her abuse. The obstacles she has overcome  now aid her in helping others. Her relationship with her husband is important. With  his support, she has been able to keep up  with the long hours and the emotional stress  of working with emotional survivors.  The Centre provides a much-needed service in Prince George. Lorraine is quick to  point out that this service is actually the  responsibility of the provincial government.  Because the centre has been self-supporting,  the Social Credit government has tried to  use it as an example of the success of privatization. Fortunately, the board has never allowed the Centre to be misused in this way.  And fortunately, for the many sexual  abuse victims, as long as the current level  of five sexual assault charges a week continues in Prince George, the Prince George  Sexual Assault Centre wUl remain open for  business.  \One minute of silence isn't enough  If /      C' '  *IB[\0  i&SCjLC3  Box  £5",  SfeJ/on f="  Display  Advertising:  This space is yours  for only $23.

Phone 255-5499  by Pauline Rankin  Last November when I pinned on my  "For Every Woman Raped in Every War"  button alongside a felt poppy, I wasn't prepared for the buttons that got pushed in  other people.  I shouldn't have been surprised. This particular button had provoked strong reaction before. In 1982, a group of women held  a quiet ceremony in Vancouver's Victory  Square, honouring women victims of war.  The evening tv news portrayed them as disruptive and a great outcry ensued.  Evidently, Remembrance Day holds a  delicate, sacred place in people's emotions  and any attempt to change it is seen as dangerous.  I was raised with Flander's Fields and  poppy drives and I become thoughtful and  emotional on November 11th. Born 12 years  after the second world war, I observed the  war-protesting years of the 60's and I've  always been acutely aware of the nuclear  threat. I choose to spend my time on Remembrance Day thinking of the horrors of  warfare and dreaming of a hfe without it.  As a feminist, I also want to redefine the  traditions of our society by seeking out the  stories of women, the stories that are swept  away in the mainstream.  Remembrance Day can have a broader  context than the world wars. Acknowledging how raping women is entwined with the  practice of war is one way of doing this. I  wear my button with deep respect and sadness and so was shocked when people called  it "very angry."  I can't forget those who  suffered... as a result  of a military mentality.  A long and fruitful discussion about my  button and the feehngs of war veterans  arose in a class I was attending. The "problems" raised by my button were explored in  an interview to determine my suitabUity for  a social service course.  I suppose I should be flattered that one  woman with one button could be perceived  as such a powerful entity, capable of bringing parades and ceremonies to a screeching  halt and dissolving war vets in the street. I  dutifuUy responded to aU criticisms, feeUng  Uke an outsider who was foreign to Remembrance Day and the structures of our society.  I am neither. My father is a war vet.  He doesn't march in parades, but he hkes  telUng stories about his time overseas. He  also hkes my button and has remarked that  freedom of speech was one of the values they  were supposedly fighting for. Remembrance  Day is a time to break sUences and reclaim lost stories. One minute of sUence isn't  enough time to tell the stories of women  and chUdren whose bodies and hves were  torn apart in the quest for power called  war. While I respect the motives of men and  women who sought to preserve our way of  hfe, I can't forget those who suffered pain  and humUiation as a result of a military  mentality.  At 11 am, November 11, my thoughts wUl  be with my sisters worldwide, including every woman raped in every war.  KINESIS Across Canada,  Poor training for poor jobs—at poor pay  by Lisa Schmidt  In a few short months, the federal  government plans to implement drastic and controversial changes in the  structure of the Unemployment Insurance plan. The shifting of funds from  benefits for unemployed Canadians to  job training programs is one proposed  change. The following article suggests  that women will have little to gain from  new training schemes, since existing  ones have consistently failed to meet  our needs.  Promising "meaningful employment opportunities" and "job security" for Canadians, the federal government introduced the  Canada Job Strategy (CJS) in the summer  of 1985.  Six programs were created with one—  the Job Re-Entry initiative—specificaUy designed to provide training, work experience  and counselling for women who have been  unable to make a "successful transition"  from the home to the labour force. Under  Job Re-Entry, women on unemployment insurance continue receiving benefits during  the training period; others can obtain a  training aUowance.  On paper, this program has potential. In  reality, it has done Uttle—if anything—to  change existing barriers women face both in  training and employment.  For starters, women continue to be  grossly under-represented in non-traditional  occupations. A statistical study of the B.C.  labour force compiled by the provincial  Women's Secretariat in 1988 shows women  continue to earn wages that average 65 percent those of men. A major factor accounting for this difference is the hardly surprising news that men's work has traditionally  been in higher paying fields such as construction, transportation and material handling, whereas women are employed, for the  most part, in lower paying clerical, hospitality and health care work.  The study suggests women are working  in traditional fields simply because they are  not being trained for non-traditional occupations.  Bookkeeping, Not Accounting  In February 1987, a Canadian Advisory  CouncU on the Status of Women (CACSW)  report criticized the CJS, saying women  "continue to be trained in traditional  limited-income occupations and there ap  pears to be httle emphasis in the Strategy  for encouraging women to enter and succeed  in non-traditional and higher paying fields."  Linda Coyle of the Women's Education  and Training Coalition agrees with the  CACSW report. (The CoaUtion, created  in 1985, represents women's groups in the  Lower Mainland and monitors the implementation of government agreements to ensure a fair share of training funds is allocated to women; WETC also assesses the  impact of training programs on women.)  Coyle cites the example of women who  want to be trained in fields such as accounting being shuffled into bookkeeping programs.  "For the most part," says Coyle, "Re-  Entry programs are geared up to meet the  needs of employers. The primary focus is  not on the needs of women in terms of creating opportunities for them."  Also supporting this claim is a report  prepared for Labour Canada eariier this  year by Marcy Cohen and Margaret White.  Their research indicates that, despite a decline in the growth of clerical employment  opportunities and a shift in the clerical sector from fuU-time to part-time employment,  women continue to receive "clerical education" in high-school, coUege and re-entry  programs.  This creates an oversupply of women  with clerical skiUs and consequently, increases women's underemployment and unemployment.  A developmental program officer in the  CJS, who asked not to be identified,-says  some women are being trained for occupations that "may seem traditional, in fact I  guess they are, but they pay weU."  Stressing that the training programs  open up career opportunities for women and  Please see Poor page 8  Remembering'The Voyage of Shattered Dreams''  by Rita Gill  It is a dangerous thing for a government  to draw hnes in the sand. But in 1914, in  an era of racial intolerance and anti-Asian  slogans, it seemed to the Canadian government quite justifiable to starve and deceive  376 Indian ship passengers.  On May 23 of that year, 376 people of Indian origin arrived by ship in Burrard Inlet.  The ship, the Komagata Maru, carried passengers who beheved their status as British  subjects gave them the privUege of immigrating to Canada. One passenger, Pooran  Singh, was to discover his status had no  bearing in Canada because of his skin color.  He was my grandfather. With the others,  Pooran Singh was caught in the net of racist  immigration pohcies the Canadian government had enacted to prevent Indians from  entering the country. The Komagata Maru  came to be known as "The Voyage of Shattered Dreams."  While the ship waited for two months in  the Vancouver harbour, Ottawa attempted  to weaken the morale and physical health of  the passengers by creating new regulations,  new legal problems. When we look at photographs of the ship's passengers and see a  smaU chUd in the front, we become aware  of the shameful fact that the Canadian government and people wanted to starve this  chUd.  The government would not allow provi-  >ns on the Komagata Maru, provisions the  local Indian community was quite wUUng to  provide.  As weU as the chUd, there was one  woman—the chUd's mother— aboard. Her  name was Kishan Kaur. The passengers of  the Komagata Maru were never permitted  to land and the ship eventuaUy returned to  India.  The Komagata Maru incident was one  of the many racist acts committed by  the Canadian government against minority groups. There is a commonaUty between  racism and sexism and their common denominator is prejudice.  Canadian immigration regulations of  that era did not allow Indian women to enter Canada. Most of the Komagata Maru  men had left their famiUes back home.  Canada's need for cheap labour led to immigration poUcies which sometimes aUowed  Asian men into the country but not Asian  women.  These racist and sexist poUcies of the  Canadian government hurt both Asian men  and women. In many cultures, a woman  without a man was less respected and, in  some cases, publicaUy disgraced or kUled.  Imagine yourself as an Asian woman Uving  in a Third World country in 1914. You have  been widowed or perhaps even divorced.  You have no financial support. Would you  have a lesser need than a man to enter  Canada, in your economic and social struggle? It really does matter that there was  one female passenger aboard the Komagata  Maru—in those times, even one was a significant number.  The Indian community in Vancouver is  organizing around contemporary racism by  commemorating the 75th anniversary of the  Komagata Maru incident. This July, the  Ross street Sikh temple held an open house  and unveUed a plaque marking the incident.  The Khalsa Diwan society—a Sikh commu  nity group—held a rally at the spot where  the Komagata Maru anchored. The city, after considerable debate, agreed to install a  plaque to mark the historic event.  A new book, The Komagata Maru Incident, was released at a conference of the  same name held in October; an historical  documentary has also been made.  Two plays have been written about the  Komagata Maru. Ajmer Kalsey's work ex  plores the Indian community's perspective,  whUe Sharon PoUock's examines the racism  of Canadians.  The Komagata Maru Historical Society is presenting a production of Pollock's The Komagata Maru Incident on  November 5 (see Bulletin Board for details). The evening will also feature discussion about racism in Canada. Call  420-2972 for more information.  The Komagata Maru—in background—"guarded"by the HMCS Rainbow in Vancouver's harbour, July 1914.  KINESIS Across Canada  Abortion fight in Nova Scotia  by Linda Choquette  The bitter dispute over access to abortion in Nova Scotia has intensified. In mid-  October, the Canadian Abortion Rights  Action League (CARAL) lost an impor  tant court challenge to provincial legislation  which restricts abortions to approved hospitals.  Then Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who previously said he might not wait for the judgement before performing abortions in his  Hahfax chnic, did indeed defy the legislation and now faces criminal charges.  CARAL had challenged the province's  Medical Services Act—hastily passed last  spring after Morgentaler announced plans  to open a HaUfax chnic—on grounds that  the act violated the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms, and that the province has no jurisdiction over abortion.  The case was lost on a question of  CARAL's legal standing to make the challenge. Lawyers for the province successfuUy  argued that CARAL is a special interest  group and not directly affected by the Medical Services Act.  "While the plaintiff, CARAL, undoubtedly is interested in the area of abortion, its  interest is that of an interest group formed  to promote its views," wrote Mr. Justice  Merlin Nunn.  Anne Derrick, CARAL's lawyer, called  the judgement "bad precedent and a very  narrow construction of standing. I don't  think it takes into account the trend toward  public interest group standing in the courts,  and my chents don't think it should be allowed to stand, so they're going to appeal  it."  In turning down their application, Nunn  did not rule on the substance of CARAL's  argument, leaving it possible for other "legitimate" parties, such as the Medical Society of Nova Scotia, to take up the challenge.  Violence,  fear common  Fear of physical and sexual violence is  part of hfe for most Canadian urban women,  says Linda MacLeod, author of a study presented to municipal leaders from more than  30 countries who met mid-October in Montreal to discuss urban safety.  MacLeod, president of the National Associations Active in Criminal Justice, a 21-  Poor from page 7  a means to advance into higher paying positions, the program officer adds, "We make  a real effort not to ghettoize women."  If this is the case, non-traditional Re-  Entry programs are certainly not being made visible to women. Of four Re-  Entry courses hsted at the Vancouver East  Canada Employment Centre, two are in the  clerical field and two prepare women for careers as health care aides.  The Women's Resource Centre in downtown Vancouver also hsts four programs:  three are in clerical training whUe the fourth  trains women to become insurance salespersons.  Low Quality Training, Too  In addition, many groups in the training  field are critical of the quality of CJS training for women.  "There exist programs that are a waste  of tax-payer's money," says Donna Stewart  of the Feminist Learning Resources Group.  "The training is not long enough, not delivered by quaUfied instructors and not recognized in the workplace."  Coyle adds, "These programs are too narrowly focused. They train women in one or  two job areas and women are not adequately  shown what is avaUable."  The reason for this can partly be ex  plained by the privatization of training programs.  EssentiaUy, the CJS is a scheme through  which private and public institutions may  apply for government funds to run training  programs. The government approves and  funds courses it beheves wUl increase employment opportunities and earning potential of participants once training is completed.  Private institutions may obtain government monies to run training programs at a  profit by, for example, hiring unqualified instructors at a lower salary or providing inadequate training materials. NaturaUy, students suffer from the substandard instruction.  Commenting on the inabihty of some  women to put together a resume upon completion of certain Re-Entry programs, Stewart says "We certainly don't need any more  women trained for disaster."  Stewart and Coyle both emphasize the  need for longer training periods, saying  women who have been out of the workforce  for a number of years require more than a  few weeks of upgrading their skiUs to become and remain employed.  And Here's Your Allowance  The training aUowance is another highly  criticized aspect of Re- Entry programs.  CJS calculates that women hving with  spouse or parent are entitled to an al  lowance of $1.75 for every hour of training  they undergo. For single women, the sum is  doubled. H the training period is 35 hours  per week, the aUowance amounts to $61 and  $123 per week respectively.  Additional funds are made avaUable for  women with dependents who declare that,  without assistance, they would be unable to  take training.  According to the Canada Mortgage Corporation, the average monthly rent for a  studio apartment in the city of Vancouver  is $427. Once rent is paid, a single woman  in a Re-Entry program has $65. a month  to pay for electricity, telephone, transportation and groceries.  Women are compeUed into near-impossible jugghng acts by the meager training allowances. The Vancouver Status of Women  was recently approached by a woman whose  enroUment in a Re-Entry course coincided  with her decision to leave an abusive relationship with her hve-in fiance. She simply couldn't see how she could find her own  apartment on an aUowance of $123 a week.  The difficulties of surviving economically  don't end with training. "In some programs,  women are better off [financiaUy] than on  welfare," Stewart points out.  "But when it comes down to the actual work, women may only be able to find  and hold down part-time work which leaves  them worse off than being on welfare."  member coaUtion, drew from federal government statistics and consultations with  women's groups across the country. "The  message is that most women are vulnerable... [not] a smaU minority that are eternal  victims," said MacLeod.  "Too often people feel that women's fear  is not a significant issue, but communities  are being threatened as women respond to  their fear of violence and impose restrictions  on their actions and those of their chUdren,  she said.  Reducing fear and violence means supporting community services, according to  MacLeod's report. Cities must push security-conscious planmng, encourage nonviolent attitudes, set up violence prevention  programs in schools and start community  action groups.  Civic leaders must make funding commitments to service groups, said MacLeod.  That women are at high risk for violence is weU-documented. MacLeod's statistics confirm that one in four females can expect a sexual assault at some time in their  Uves, half before the age of seventeen. Fifty-  six percent of Canadian urban women ar<  now afraid to walk in their own neighbour  hoods after dark.  Pay equity  stumbles  in Ontario  With just a few months untU the January  1990 deadline, many Ontario companies are  not prepared to comply with that province's  pay equity legislation requirements. According to an August survey by an independent consultant, only half the 165 companies questioned had completed the painstaking job-to-job analysis that wUl reveal non-  equitable pay rates.  Ontario's legislation requires employers!  to compare so-called women's jobs with so-  called men's jobs and adjust wages where  jobs found of comparable value get unequal  compensation. Points of comparison include  skiU, effort, working conditions and respon-  sibUity. Job "gender" is determined by the  percentage of workers in each classification  60 percent for women, 70 percent for men.  Where wage inequities are found, employers must spend at least the equivalent o;  1 percent of annual payroll untU pay catchup is achieved.  Most of the firms unprepared to enforce  pay equity are large ones and may be in for  a surprise. According to the survey, thest  firms appear unaware of both the substantial work involved in job analysis and the  disruption in the workplace that investig,  tion and comparison of gender-dominated  jobs wUl stimulate.  "From our experience, it is having a very  strong impact on productivity and on attitudes in the male work force," said Gaye  Trombley, spokesperson for the consulting  firm, Sibson and Co.  "We've found some situations where the  organization may be dealing with 40 percent of the male employees appealing results  purely on the basis that they didn't get an  increase and the women did. And there are  a lot of people spending a lot of time talking  about pay equity results and not working."  Trombley's findings to date show wage  adjustments for female-dominated jobs wUl  be substantial, particularly in the public  sector which leads private industry in the  number of female-dominated jobs.  The majority of companies questioned  said they did expect to find some pay inequity among their workers.  KINESIS /////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////^^^^^  International  The environment  Unlocking our power as consumers  by Joni Miller  Bernadette VaUely says that in only 18  months of operation the Women's Environmental Network grew from 2 members  to 2,000 and sent manufacturers in Britain  scrambhng to have their paper products  designated 'environmentally friendly'. Val-  lely, a founding member of the London-  based network, was in Vancouver this October at the invitation of Greenpeace to discuss her organization's success in pressuring corporations to cease using dioxins and  other poisonous substances.  A half hour with VaUely could change  your shopping habits forever. An informed  spokeswoman, she articulates clearly the environmental dangers of common household  products.  "We've unlocked a whole consumer power  that women didn't know they had," VaUely  says. "Women have complained to their MP,  chucked out their nappies [diapers], written  to every single company they could think of  and then caUed us to ask what to do next."  Women's Environmental Network  (WEN) began in 1987 when VaUely and her  friend Alison CosteUo began investigating  the use of dioxins by manufacturers of paper products. Both women were members  of Friends of the Earth—an environmental  group with branches in several countries.  CosteUo has a degree in chemistry from Sussex University.  Dioxins are used in the bleaching process  of paper and are known poisons (See Kinesis Dec/Jan. 1989). These chemicals were  The  Sanitary^  Pratejapon  Scandal  produced   ■   Ever ;-*'•;■ ^  have caused cancers and birth  defects in an.mals ■ The Women's  Environmental Network is campaigning for paper prooucts. e  soft tissue paper products »-  towels, tampons and ban es a sc ssbie =z  pies to be manufactured without  chlorine bleaching ■  accidentally discovered as a byproduct in  the manufacture of Agent Orange, a deadly  poison used by the U.S. army in the Vietnam War. Dioxins have been hnked with  cancer, birth defects, sterUity, hver damage and suppression of the immune system.  Once in the human body, they cannot be  removed. Last year in B.C., concern about  dioxins leeching into milk from paper cartons bolstered sales of milk in glass bottles.  "We wanted to form an environmental  group that talks to women about things  that concern them—like chUdren", VaUely  says.  VaUely and CosteUo were inspired by the  Swedish example, where consumer pressure  for unbleached paper products has resulted  in an almost complete turn around by manufacturers. Ninety-five percent of such products are now produced without chlorine.  When a chlorine-free toilet roU was first introduced in Sweden, it captured 50 percent  of the market within one year. Unbleached  disposable diapers now account for the entire market in that country.  Getting the story on dioxins in England  required detective work. "I called up several  companies, posing as a buyer and asked for  a large quantity of unbleached paper," Val-  lely says. "'You don't need to worry about  dioxin' I was told, 'nobody understands it  in the U.K.'  "I was shocked—I realized that they [the  companies] knew aU about it. Before that  I was naive—I thought the manufacturers  lacked information."  a        The two women continued their inquiries.

She says that  *   dioxins present in "  Lesbian feminist conference  So many workshops, so little time  by Bet Cecill  The organizers of the Regional Lesbian  Feminist Conference held late September in  Seattle have a great deal to be proud of.  This was the best organized conference I  have ever attended. The attention to detail was superb—the only thing missing was  coffee the first morning. Approximately 80  workshops provided a wide range of topics.  I wanted them spread out over a week as  there were at least five in each time slot  that reaUy interested me. The workshops  that I did attend were aU weU presented and  thought provoking.  "Bringing Conflict Out of the Closet" focused on the positive. Conflict can be an  opportunity for growth and there are concrete skiUs to be learned. The workshop  opened with a video of an argument. Particularly striking was how varied our reactions  are to the same situation. Also striking was  that no one in the room had experienced a  successful resolution (defined as "everyone  pleased with the result") to a large group  conflict.  What is successful is a whole topic  in itself. I was reheved to find a lot of  women with similar questions, experiences  and skiUs. I was disappointed that no one  had any magic solutions.  "A Community Response to Lesbian Battering" was a dynamic and moving workshop. The questions of why we avoid this issue and what we, as a community, can do  were answered by a woman who has been  abused, by a woman who has abused, by a  therapist and by a woman from AABL (Advocates for Abused and Battered Lesbians).  The answers that came made sense to  me—"women aren't hke that," fear, guilt  and shame keeping sUent; lesbian battering doesn't fit our ideas about sexism being responsible for violence; we need to call  women on abusive behaviour and support  the abuser to change; sUence breeds isolation; abuse can happen to anyone (feminists  are not immune); individual therapy is helpful but not sufficient; our analysis of lesbian battering is minimal; counselling both  women together is futUe (at least initiaUy);  battering/abuse is a pattern in a relationship (rarely, if ever, mutual).  This workshop could be a whole article in  itself. The courage, honesty and insight of  the panel members was inspirational. The  number of women in the room told me that  this is a concern of a lot of lesbians and we  need to do more as a community.  "The Way for Lesbian Leadership" was  a presentation by the New Alhance Party.  I was both fascinated and disturbed. NAP  managed to put a Black woman on the slate  for U.S. president in aU 50 states. (In the  U.S. it is difficult to get a third party candidate on the baUot and requires a lot of  popular support.)  They have buUt a multi-racial coaUtion  that is pro-lesbian and gay. Those accomplishments are extremely significant and  seem to be the result of a "be more of  who you are and let's work together" policy rather than a "let's aU be the same so  that we can work together." They do seem  to have figured out how to work with diversity on a large scale.  What disturbed me was their apparent  wUUngness to work with contradictions that  I would find intolerable. For example, one  member of the party is the Nation of Islam  whose leader has made anti-Jewish statements. I left wanting to know more and  wanting to figure out how to apply what  they have learned.  "Power, Ritual Magic and S/M" was my  fun workshop. It is also the hardest to write  about because of the personal and controversial nature of the topic. It would take me  a whole article to do it justice. I do want  to say that I left impressed by the respectfulness of the presenters, by the chmate of  emotional safety that was created, and by  the power and possibilities of ritual. I want  to know more about magic and ritual in aU  contexts.  The strength of this conference was in its  diversity and the competence both of overall organization and of the presentation of  workshops.  Its weaknesses were also a result of this  diversity. Although the plenary sessions  were devoted to questions of activism and  organizing, I want an entire conference devoted to those questions. I could spend  an entire weekend talking about the what,  when, who, where and why of strategies for  social change.  danger to babies, causing diaper rash and  other problems.  Tampons and sanitary napkins have also  been targetted by WEN. I've been hearing  for years that tampons are dangerous, but  when VaUely explained the issues, the danger hit home. "If you look at marketing,"  VaUely says "white is equated with virginity, cleanliness, sterUity. The fact is, tampons have never been sterile."  "One study conducted in the U.S. concluded that 75 percent of women using tampons wUl have negative health effects. Infections are common. There's also 'layering'-  meaning that the surface of the tampon  takes cells off the vaginal waU.  "Tampons are made of 50 percent cotton, 50 percent rayon. Cotton is grown with  the use of pesticides, then bleached with  dioxins. These products are going inside  women's bodies, in touch with very vulnerable tissue. We think they should be  banned."  In Sweden, doctors have been working towards banning tampons because of a suspected hnk with cervical cancer.  ' WEN recommends alternatives to paper products, such as diaper services and  reusable menstrual caps. (Products similar  to diaphragms, designed to hold in menstrual blood.)  WEN started agitating with a press  release announcing a women's campaign  against bleached paper products. They  helped produce a film entitled Whiter than  White, about the bleaching process. When  it was aired on tv, the phone hnes were  jammed with women who wanted to get '  volved. VaUely says this film has been kept  off tv in Canada despite efforts to have it  shown, but can be obtained through Greenpeace.  The publicity also brought pressure from  manufacturers. "Before we went on air  we called up the companies and asked  them to change their process," VaUely says.  "They were incredibly rude. Afterwards  some companies—Tampax, for example—  tried to sue us. But we had a lawyer go  over everything we said. We knew we were  right."  This year WEN released The Sanitary  Protection Scandal (printed on recycled  paper, of course), a comprehensive study  of the effects of dioxin use in paper products. In the back of the book, they hst information on companies, including names, addresses and phone numbers of key personnel. Women are encouraged to call directly  to the people in charge of corporate decision  making.  The results have been positive. In January of 1989, two major companies, Peau-  douce and Proctor & Gamble, announced  they would be switching to unbleached pulp  in their products. The new products are a  yeUowish colour. VaUely expects other companies to foUow.  "It was a case of being in the right place  at the right time," she says. "Even Tampax wants to be caUed 'environmentaUy  friendly' now because their tampon biode-  grades. But their products contains cotton,  which is full of pesticides."  With many battles yet to fight, Women's  Environmental Network plans to continue  campaigning. They have recently opened  their meetings to men, hoping to attract a  larger base of support. Male members are  not aUowed to vote, however. WEN publishes a newsletter and holds regular pubhc  meetings and events. There are now local  groups based in London, West Yorks, Essex, Somerset, South Wales and Scotland.

International  El Salvador  "We cannot wait until the war ends"  by Lorena Jara  El Salvador is Spanish for Vietnam  said a bumper sticker I read not long ago.  Those few words describe the horrors Salvadorean people are facing daily in their  struggle for a better society. The few mainstream media articles covering the war in El  Salvador teU us of institutionaUzed repression, of a right-wing government hnked to  the death squads, of miUtary raids where  unarmed civilians are the main victims,  bombings by the government air force of vUlages and hamlets—the hst goes on.  Among these horror stories there is no  space left to tell of Salvadorean women's active role in the mass movement.  In hght of this, the Action Committee for  Women in El Salvador invited Hena Flora  Pena, executive member of the National Coordinating CouncU of Salvadorean Women  (CONAMUS), to come to Canada and meet  with women's organizations, pohticians, solidarity groups, church organizations and the  public to share her first-hand experience of  the situation of Salvadorean women.  During her seven day tour of B.C., I  was Pena's translator. For seven days I  shared my hfe with a woman who emanates  strength and has a fantastic sense of humour. Above aU, she has an immeasurable  love for her work helping other women—  learning with them to understand and break  the bonds of centuries of indoctrination in  which Latin American women are taught  not to get involved in anything outside their  homes because "that is for men only."  "Throughout Salvadorean history" says  Pena, "women have always played an important role in the struggle of our people.  However, we are hardly ever mentioned,  mainly because women do not write history...our participation has never been recognized."  Like aU Latin American women, added  Pena, Salvadorean women have been taught  by the society as a whole to be subservient,  submissive, nurturing and passive. Because  of this education, women are insecure and  feel so powerless.  CONAMUS was formed in 1986 by  women from different sectors of Salvadorean  society who felt women's issues had to be  addressed, regardless of the war situation.  The issues? Laws that "protect" women but  are not enforced by the government, such as  labour laws requiring employers to provide  day-care facUities; the existence of discrim  inatory laws against domestic workers, who  are mostly women; the fact there is only  one maternity hospital in the country where  up to three women have to share a bed.  El Salvador lacks a family code to protect  women and their chUdren when men abandon them. Violence against women and chUdren is reaching unbehevable levels of bru-  taUty.  CONAMUS feels such issues need addressing now. "We can not wait untU the  war ends." says Pena, "The consequences of  marginalization and discrimination against  women are too severe for us to keep on waiting."  Furthermore, through sharing their experiences in CONAMUS, women learned  the war was affecting them in simUar ways.  It didn't matter whether they were peasants, factory workers, health workers, market vendors or professionals—most of them  have been left as head of their households  facing a war-torn economy where the government's main priority is to keep the war  machine going.  "When men are forcibly drafted into the  army or choose to join the other side," says  Pena "or when men or couples are dragged  away to be imprisoned, kUled or disappeared by the death squads or government  security forces, the grandmothers, mothers,  aunts or sisters are left alone with the responsibility to raise the crops, if they are  peasants, or find any kind of job, if they are  city dweUers, to support their families.  "Sharing this reaUty made us realize the  war was also a women's issue, as is finding  an end to the conflict."  Part of U.S. Policy  CONAMUS is one of 73 grass-roots and  church organizations forming the Permanent Committee for National Debate. This  committee supports the dialogue between  the government and the FMLN aimed at a  negotiated end to the conflict. CONAMUS  also forms part of the Central American  Women CouncU for Peace in the Region;  women's organizations from Costa Rica,  Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras are  also participating.  "Salvadorean women don't see the war  in our country as an isolated situation,  but as part of the U.S. government's pohcies for the region," says Pena "In this  regional council, we took upon the tasks  to monitor and to pressure our respective  governments in complying with the Tela-  Honduras-Accord signed by the five Central  American presidents this year."  On the home front, CONAMUS work is  reaching women who have never been organized before to make them participants in  the pohtical, economic and social hfe of the  country. Through educational sessions, conferences, workshops and group discussions,  women's issues are raised.  "Because of the high pohticization of Salvadoreans and the situation of war, it does  not take long to convince women to participate," says Pena. Identifying their problems and taking actions within their own  means empowers women. "Women who not  long ago never dared to think of speaking in  public today do not hesitate to stand and  publicly defend their points of view. It is  a beautiful experience to observe the inner  strength of these women growing."  Dealing with violence against women is  an important part of CONAMUS' work.  pubUc or the media when an 11-year-old  chUd was burnt with cigarettes as a form  of discipline, or when a woman was shot by  her husband because she did not answer him  quickly enough."  "It seems that the situation of war has  increased the violence against women and  chUdren. We felt we must do something  about it—we cannot aUow our chUdren to  grow in a society that condones brutality."  CONAMUS raises the issue of abuse in  paid articles published in major newspapers  and in their 15 minute weekly radio program, also a paid spot.  Organizing Is a Crime  CONAMUS work has not been unnoticed  by the government. "Organizing is a crime  in my country," states Pena. She tells of  Maria Cristina Gomez, a teacher, a Baptist  and the producer of CONAMUS' radio program. She was assassinated after her "unknown" captors tore off the skin of her arms  They have opened a clinic to assist women  who have been physicaUy or sexuaUy  abused. Counting on the volunteer work of  professional women and using a corner of  CONAMUS' office, the chnic, the only one  of its kind in the country, was opened last  March. Helping women break the sUence  about their abuse is a major problem for  the chnic, just as it is in Canada, as Pena  learned when sharing her experience with  women working in shelters here.  CONAMUS has also to deal with the  consequences of institutionalized repression.  As we know from different reports, prisoners of the Salvadorean government security  forces are raped, electric shocks are applied  to their genitalia and many other atrocities  are committed against them.  "The fear for their hves makes it almost  impossible for us to help women who have  suffered repression," says Pena.  "Salvadoreans have become insensitive to  pure acts of brutahty. For instance, there  was not much reaction from the general  and poured acid on her back. The purpose  of this crime was to discourage women from  joining CONAMUS.  "It did not work," says Pena. On the contrary, Maria Cristina's death has become  a symbol and an encouragement for other  women to join us. We continue growing."  Pena was constantly asked about her own  personal security and would reply, "I have  survived 10 years of war, I might survive 10  more. However, hke any other Salvadorean  who wants a better society, my hfe is at  risk."  When I kissed Hena Flora Pena goodbye at the Vancouver International Airport,  I thought it was true that Latin American history has to be rewritten to recognize  women's role in it. However, without women  hke Maria Cristina or Hena Flora, we would  not have much to write about.

I was reading ChUdren of  the Volcano by Canadian author Alison Acker and the women in the photo  looked as though they were in their late  teens.  In fact, over 4^,000 Guatemalan  women were widowed in the campaign  of terror waged by Guatemala's military  governments in the late 70's and early  80's. Most of them were illiterate, indigenous peasant women and many were  as young as seventeen.  These women were not broken by  their suffering—instead, it has taught  them to resist and to organize. In  September 1988, despite continued intimidation by the military and manipulation by the (now civilian) government, several thousand widows came  together to form the National Coordinating Committee of Widows of  Guatemala, CONAVIGUA, to demand  their rights with a unified voice.  Since then, CONAVIGUA has continued to grow in strength and numbers,  and now has representation in 7 of 22  regions of the country.  When I was in Guatemala last July,  I spoke with Rosalina Tuyuc, Coordinator, and Maria Morales, Vice-  Coordinator of the National Directorship of CONAVIGUA. I was inspired by their dignity, clarity and  courage. Their story is unique and remarkable. It is also the same herstory of women coming together to gain  strength and awareness by sharing experiences, moving ahead step-by-step  to demand their rights and to reach  out to their sisters around the world.  —Ruth Beck  The Widow's Struggle  During the time from 1982 to 1986, the widows were dispersed, each trying to meet her  needs but with the idea that we needed to  organize. We needed to organize not only  because of the suffering—we could hide our  history—but we can't hide the fact that  we're part of a huge scar that the violence  has left behind.  In 1987, information came out about aid  to widows and orphans. The government  was offering food—beans and corn, fertU-  izer for our corn crops and the canceUation  Guatemala City, May Day 1989: over 1,000 indigenous people came down from the  highlands to participate in the annual march.  of bank debts. In time, we saw that these  were only promises and that the government  wouldn't fulfill them. So we organized to demand what they were offering. This is how  the struggle began.  At first, committees formed at the township level but we saw that the women  wanted a national assembly to hnk them  together with representatives from different  municipaUties. So we formed our National  Assembly with our own funds and with help  from some trade unions.  The National Assembly took place in  September of 1988. We elected eight companeras to the National Directive. We discussed aU the problems that were occurring  in different parts of the country. We realized  that the problems of Chimaltenango, Solola  and the Quiche were aU the same. We'd had  the same experience.  Our Common Experiences  During the violence of the early 80s, many  of us had to flee, hide or leave our homes:  we've borne hunger and months away from  our homes.  The army came and took away, tortured  and kUled our men, burned our houses, stole  our things and raped many of us. Now, the  army is controlling our vUlages. They say  that we widows must sign a document saying that the people who kUled our men were  the guerriUas. They say we must sign but  we said that no we wouldn't.  The National Assembly also exposed our  suffering on the plantations and our double exploitation, the fact that we've had to  be mother and father. The forced work of  the fathers on the plantations was left to us.  rr- />•  Due to a lack of work in our own communities, we have to go to work on the plantations. There we suffer the robbery of our  labour.  Some of us earn only $0.25 to $0.30 per  day though they say that the minimum  wage is Q4.20 per day [$1.84 Cdn.]. Women  are often given work in areas where it's difficult to coUect the crop. They pay Q3.00  per quintal [100 pounds] and if you only collect 25 pounds you just get your food. Also,  we have to use our wages to buy corn, soap,  and medicine etc.  CONAVIGUA unites women widowed by  the violence, women widowed by Ulness,  single mothers and single women. It was  born out of a need to defend our Uves and  struggle for survival, to defend the dignity  of women and to demand respect for our  rights.  Our organization promotes the rights of  indigenous people because we have suffered the most repression. Also we see  that women in the countryside—peasant  women—have never had the possibility to  develop themselves in the areas of health,  education and dressmaking. So CONAVIGUA was born of suffering, and it was born  to defend our right to organize and to increase our awareness of the value of our  rights.  Organizing Despite Intimidation  Since CONAVIGUA was born, control over  our communities has increased. In AprU of  1988, the army came into four townships in  the highlands to buUd army bases. They accuse us, members of CONAVIGUA, of being subversives. They say this in order to  create fear.  In the areas controlled by the army, the  people don't hve in peace. The people say  that the army is trying to kUl them with  fear. We don't know when they'U try and  kidnap us. We need to get our chUdren to  run errands for us but then the army detains our chUdren for a whUe.  We're not free to move around to pasture  our goats. Our tradition is to go out to the  pasture and for some of the women to weave  whUe the goats are eating. We can't do this  now because the army stiU comes and rapes  women.  The army and other authorities give some  aid to our townships but only if we agree not  to organize ourselves as CONAVIGUA. The  mayors don't want to legalize our commit-  tees so they make trouble for us. The army  has offered houses, but only to gain entry into our communities. The army doesn't  have our interests at heart. In the past, they  were responsible for killing our people so  why should we trust them when they say  they want to improve our hves.  Since we formed CONAVIGUA, one of  our achievements has been to increase our  own sense of worth and strength. We widows have said to the army that we aren't  afraid of them any longer.  We have given five two-day courses in  the past eight months. The first course was  about the history of CONAVIGUA. The  second talked about the situation of women  in the countryside. In the third course, we  discussed our rights as Guatemalans—our  ■*  rights to hfe, land, health and housing, and  «  our rights as women. Our fourth course was  1  about the constitution and our latest course  _£. was on health care.  |      We would hke to have literacy courses  "■ but we can't afford it. We try to make  the courses bUingual or in Spanish because  we have women from four indigenous ethnic groups [Quiche, Mam, Cakchiquel and  IxU]. Translation costs a lot. About 60 to  80 companeras have come each time. They  have to pay their transportation and food.  The women give up a lot to come. We know  that the courses are important because they  unite us and teach us a lot about our rights.  Another achievement of CONAVIGUA  has been to hnk with other organizations,  such as the UASP, the Popular and Trade  Union Action Unity [the united voice of the  popular movement in Guatemala] and with  groups outside the country. We are members of the UASP because we know that  it is the greatest expression of the people.  We are also looking for this unity—we don't  only work with indigenous women and we  can't fight on our own. We rely on the help  of everyone working together.  We know that women suffer discrimination —we've ah missed opportunities to  work or study. So we know that the participation of women is important in looking for  solutions to these larger problems.  Our Sisters In Solidarity  We have also found support from women  in other countries. Moral support has come  through denouncing the repression that's  going on here in Guatemala. If it weren't  for this, who knows how much more repression we'd be suffering. We would hke  to have more visits from groups from other  countries so that you can witness our situation and go back and teU people about it.  We also need funds to support the series of  courses that we are offering the women.  Without these links, it would be hard for  people to hear about what's reaUy happening here because the army doesn't want to  show its face as the assassins of the people.  Before, nobody had heard the stories of our  suffering, only the government propaganda.  Now, even though we are women, widows,  and we have suffered, people are hearing our  voice.  Women who would like to actively  show their solidarity with the women  of CONAVIGUA can contact or send  financial contributions via the Guatemala Human Rights Commission, Box  4274 Stn. A, Vancouver, BC, V6B 3Z7.  We provide educational material and  initiate urgent action campaigns to  demand respect for human rights in  Guatemala. Financial donations should\  be made out to the Commission and\  state that they are for CONAVIGUA.  KINESIS by Jackie Brown  Marilyn French is having fun  as she shuttles between four overflow lecture halls answering questions from some of the 1,100 plus  who have come to the University of  B.C. to hear her speak. The topic  for discussion is her 1985 book  Beyond Power—an unapologetic  attack on patriarchal values which  French blames for thousands of  years of woman bashing.  Now that the formal presentation is out of the way, her scholarly, restrained dehvery gives way  to some very blunt criticisms of  male morality and there is a sense  that given a different venue, this  woman would blow the roof off.  French is clearly angry as she  talks about the oppression of  women and the violence they are  subjected to. She drives her point  home by reminding the audience  that for most of modern history  women have not had the power "to  close their legs en masse."  The October lecture is the last  official duty in what has been a  busy week for the Harvard professor and author of The Women's  Room—a book which did as much  to inspire women to anger and  feminism as MiUet's Sexual Politics, Greer's The Female Eunuch and Frieden's The Feminine Mystique.  WhUe The Women's Room  established French as a popular  novelist, Beyond Power, an extensively researched analysis of the  origins and maintenance of patriarchy, soUdified her place as a feminist theorist, although some have  criticized her as an "ivory tower"  thinker.  To a certain extent this is true.  French is an academic who has  reached the top of her profession. She is weU-off and clearly  views the world from a comfortable place. She also has the heady  notion that pleasure is what we reaUy need and the only thing worth  striving for. Maybe. But tell that  to the woman who has enough to  deal with just ensuring survival for  herself and her chUdren.  StiU, French's analysis is remarkable for its depth and clarity. And the fact that she does not  apologize for her criticism of male  values is refreshing in these days  of feminist bashing. French was reportedly seething after taping a  CBC Journal panel discussion on  feminism hosted by Barbara Frum,  who seemed more interested in  soothing male egos than getting  down to the issues.  In contrast, tonight's lecture  has included the warning that the  same behef system that dominates  and represses women could weU result in the end of the human race.  It Was Not Always This Way  For French, patriarchy represents  more than just men in control:  it is a tragic rejection of nature that has not only undermined  women but has created ugly societies rooted in fear and coercion. So successful has this "moral  revolution" against women been  that their very humanness is questioned. "To be human is to be male  and to be male is to be in control,"  says French.  But it was not always this  way. French beheves that for the  first three million years or so of  our existence, hominid, then homo  sapien women and men hved harmoniously in co-operative, gathering societies which revered nature. Women, who were hkely considered wondrous for their abihty  to give birth, were the central focus. They maintained close bonds  with their chUdren, taught them  to share food and affection and  were largely responsible for ensuring the survival of the species.  Older males played a marginal  role even after they became  hunters some two mUlion years  ago, but weren't unhappy with the  arrangement. Men did not dominate, says French, who rejects  their portrayal as brutish cavemen  who went around bashing women  over the head to claim them as  property.  This view, she says, is patriarchy's attempt to legitimize itselt  if men are dominant and aggressive today, it's because they've always been that way.  Early societies, then, were ma-  tricentric but not matriarchal.  "Women did not develop laws to  control men even though we know  that during certain periods women  had great power, "says French.  Something happened to change  this peaceful existence and French  speculates the discovery of the  male role in procreation was the  key factor. This occurred some  time after the emergence of homo  sapiens about 200,000 years ago although the patriarchal process did  not begin to accelerate untU about  10,000 B.C.E. when the first signs  of war appear.  Here's what French thinks happened:  Men hunted, which was a terribly unreUable business and, as a  result, they often returned empty-  handed. This reinforced their  marginal value within the group  and they may have begun to feel  envious of women. The hunters  needed an excuse for doing such a  lousy job, but what?  The answer was all-powerful  nature. "If nature is in control  then men cannot be blamed," says  French. This probably resulted  in male-only hunting cults which  used ritual and symbol to bribe  nature.  EventuaUy, she says, these gods  came to be seen as transcendant —  that is, able to affect nature without in turn being affected. The  idea of control became the central  focus of the hunting cults as men  wished for the same transcendant  powers. This would prove difficult  though, since, as French points  out, the only way to transcend nature is to die. Unfortunately for  women, men found a way around  thL problem when they twigged  that they had a part in making babies.  If impregnating a woman is not  true transcendence, it comes very  close, because men can procreate  without being affected. "They saw  themselves as closer to god and  therefore deemed they had control," says French. "With this self-  definition, patriarchy was born."  As the centuries roUed on, the  rejection of uncontroUable nature  (which had made men marginal)  became more profound. Women,  who were closest to nature, came  to be seen as inferior. Natural  functions of lactation, menstrua  tion and birth were held in contempt.  Although women resisted the  new ideas—French cites myths  and stories from Greek, Aztec,  Babylonian, Norse and other cultures as evidence of the long  struggle between matricentric and  patriarchal values—it was to no  avaU. Priests and their foUowers  used "power over" to change customs so that chUdren remained  with their father instead of their  mothers. The bond between man  and chUd was promoted as transcendant to the bond between  women and chUdren.  MatrUineal rules of descent were  replaced with patrilineal ownership of property and chUdren.  Women were sexuaUy regulated  so that men knew which chUdren  were their own. Of course, since  women were closest to inferior  nature, they were eventually excluded from institutions and could  not obtain positions of power.  Indeed, men born by caesar-  ian section instead of the poUuted  birth canal were considered the  best rulers because they "were not  of woman born."  Today, the ideal of control is  stiU held in high esteem, says  French. "Bonds of affection, community, sharing and love are seen  as impediments to self-reaUzation.  We view procreation and chUd  rearing with contempt." Even  historical figures Uke Ghengis  Khan and Napoleon—who conquered and brutalized—are considered great because they controUed large numbers of territories  and people.  And here French offers a dire  warning: "We are beginning to  see a revision of attitudes towards  men hke Hitler and Mussolini, who  over time, wUl take their place in  history as great men." Her prediction is aU the more chUUng  considering the growing popularity of neo-nazi white supremacists  in North America. Members of a  Vancouver sect recently defamed a  Jewish synagogue with the words  "six million were not enough."  For French, men's image of  themselves as controllers is the  rock on which patriarchy was  founded. It began with the invention of a transcendent god, superior to men, and aU other stratifications orginate from this. Thus  white is superior to Black, one nation is superior to another, one  rehgion is better than another.  But the primary stratification, she  says, is the idea that men are superior to women.  The Slime Under The Rug  Entrenching this behef has required centuries of effort to make  women legaUy and morally dependant on men, with no consequence  paid to the fact that men, as a  group, do not support or protect  women and take no responsibihty  for children. Quite the opposite,  says French, citing widespread  poverty among women (especiaUy  under capitalism) and rampant  physical and sexual abuse. This  is the "slime" under patriarchy's  rug, she says, adding that bringing the abuse out into the open is  feminism's greatest achievement.  Why do men continue to support a phUosophy which also de  mands fear and obedience on their  part and requires that they sacrifice intimacy, trust and love? Despite the irony that most men  are as marginal now as they  ever were under matricentric societies, French beheves there is one  promise that keeps patriarchy in  place.  "In return for fear and obedience, which is also caUed deference," she says, " aU men—  even the lowest on the rung- -are  granted superiority over women."  Giving up this power makes men  more hke women "and that is a  terrifying thought to men raised as  they are—as they aU are—to de-  that she also once beheved it was  better to transcend the female, aspiring to be equal to men within  patriarchy co-opts women.  Paraphrasing from the gospel of  Thomas, she says: "Thomas asks  the lord if women may enter the  hfe. Jesus says 'yes, if she shall  make herself male.' We have lots of  them—Margaret Thatcher ..."  Overall, we stiU have a long  way to go, says French. Progress  is slow and impeded by men who  hang on to the promise of control and superiority and sabotage  those who want change. Patriarchy  is very smart and should never be  underestimated, she says, referring  to the current anti-feminist mood  and its message that women have  gone to far, men have feehngs too  and so on ad n  "Patriarchy knows how to divide and conquer and has always  used this technique," says French.  "It took us 5,000 years to get here  and we aren't going to undo it in  20 or a hundred."  But, if today's young women are  threatened by feminism because  they are told men wUl be intimidated, French offers this prediction: "When you're 18 and 19 and  just as sexy as can be, you don't  want to think about it. And I don't  blame you. I wouldn't either. But  sooner or later you're going to become a feminist because you're going to have that baby and you're  going to get dumped on.  "Sooner or later, you'U end up  with us."  French beUeves that change wUl  require a return to matricentric  values of love, self-worth and pleasure. Pivotal to this devolution  is reproduction which must once  again be seen as valuable for both  men and women (although she is  quick to add that not aU women  must become mothers). Those who  do must permit fuU male involvement in raising the cluld, she says,  although French knows from experience why women might be reluctant to do so. Having chUdren gave  French a real taste of male transcendence and control, and she  didn't hke it.  "He was never around ... he  never took care of them, he  wouldn't change a diaper. He  didn't have a right to decide what  would happen to them but he took  that right anyway."  If men must shift their thinking  in order to achieve change, women  must also reject the aUure of patriarchy.

Many of us assume, mistakenly I beheve,  that at this time in our hves we have either given up the search for relevaiice or settled for security, however deadly and boring it might be. My own eyes have seen this  scenario played out as a natural part of retirement, as two people finally become acquainted with the basic differences in their  attitudes whUe hving in the same house that  was hers and is now his as weU.  After 45 years of marriage, my spouse—  who has always been hi charge of his hfe  and affirms this by refusing to do anything  that does not please him—slyly took over  my house, became interested in my house  plants, nudged me away from the stove and  proceeded to find fault with my friends.  Relegated to the washing and ironing, I  fooled him by becoming interested in the  status of women in our culture and bowed  out of his new found housewifery.  We often teU the story of the spouse who  decides when it is time to turn out the hght  and hit the sack, regardless of where she is  in the middle of the chapter. When he is  ready, the good wife is or should be ready as  weU. More often than not, in his retirement  he has decided they wUl do together only  those things he has an appetite for. She has,  after aU, only to please him and, as I heard  one man explain, she can have a free ride.  So it was that after almost 50 years of  struggle and sacrifice to get to this time in  our hves, the attitude with which we approached the meaning of retirement created  irreconcUable differences.  I was not prepared to have our hves become narrower rather than broader after  putting my energy and heart into securing  for a very insecure man the means to enjoy  his retirement and mine as weU. I had still  Our choice to be  observer or  participant will  put a different  view on how we  see those  changes.  not learned there is never enough to create this miracle for those whose fear of losing money paralyzes them into isolation and  rigid thinking.  The years between his retirement and  my finally receiving the pension were hard  years. The friendship that had seen us  through many hardships disappeared almost completely as he poured his negative  phUosophy in my rebellious ears. Never a  sharer, he insisted he spoke for us both.  My writing and the support of my feminist sisters kept me sane and busy, becoming  ever more involved in the practical apphca-  tion of collective outrage against the sexist  underpinnings of the patriarchal culture. In  supporting other women, I was able to have  a more realistic view of my own situation.  I refused the role of victim, recognizing  the enabler in myself and sympathizing with  an unconscious tyrant who was becoming  ever more impatient for me to know my  place in our marriage.  The decision to part was mutual: I had  become an embarrassment, my activism an  insult to decency, and ultimatums were issued. So it was at 65 with my first pension  cheque in hand I became my own person,  prepared to spend the rest of my conscious  hfe in pursuit of my own spirit, in defense  of aU women.  My poetry was published. I discovered  there were words in my head and heart that  could make women shriek with laughter and  men squirm with embarrassment. I was invited hither and yon to do my thing. I wrote  and read, spoke and marched for the next  five years.

This award was a precious reaffirmation  of my life-long desire to test my potential  beyond the farmly role, to move out into the  excitement of challenging that constricting  role we once accepted as our lot.

Having no use for either power or prestige, I cast myself in the role of motivater,  my enthusiasm for the battle energizing  those with more energy.  Those ten productive years of my hfe culminated in the creation of the Fay Peterson House for abused women and chUdren  in Thunder Bay: a much needed facility that  took immense struggle to bring into existence and wUl continue to serve its good  purpose for years to come.  I invested more health than I hac  this project and learned the lesson of every  idealist—that unrealistic expectations can  break your heart and make you a pain in  the ass to your comrades.  They forgave me and insisted that I also  must have the further recognition of Member of the Order of Canada in 1986. By this  time I had left the area, recuperated from  major surgery and settled half a continent  away to write about it aU. I continue to grow  in understanding and spiritual power. The  hfe I left at 65 has given me no regrets, I  put my heart in it and paid my dues.  I now accept my Crone state in the same  spirit I accepted the opportunity to be active in the change that must come about  if each of us accepts responsibiUty for a  femimst ideology that makes choice a viable option. The choices I make today are  made with health in mind. I have rheumatoid arthritis and all those other things that  badger us when we get old, but the last 15  years of my hfe have left me with enough  satisfaction to see me through whatever is  in store.  My two sons have given me great support and made me proud of the relationships they have with their families but I no  longer feel hke the traditional mother; as  one said recently, "you have only to be wise,  Mother."  It is the wisdom that my Crone persona  has brought me that aUows me to see the  universal picture and my place in it. I have  transcended both fear and desire. I hve to  prick the sensibilities of those who beheve  they have the wit and the power to make  my choices for me. It is my best hope to remain an irritant to the established norm as  long as hfe allows it.  It is not enough to say that I, in my 75  years, have seen great changes. Our choice  to be observer or participant wUl put a different view on how we see those changes.  Courage never tested is a poor substitute  for surrendering one's hfe to chance and  daring to hve one's truth in defence of a  larger truth, the sisterhood of women, aU  women—that class which has not untU this  time been able to bring their considerable  influence to bear on men, who clearly have  taken for granted a right to rule.  That most of us have no stomach for the  catbird seat of power does not mean we are  not equipped with the inteUigence to see a  better way of doing what men have thought  they do very weU. The reahty is, introspection and the time for it have given a head  start on new thought to my gender. We have  had more occasion to wonder why he has  made it so hard on himself and been such a  pain to the rest of us!  I beheve woman's relationship with  women is more important than any other relationship today, for through it we find ourselves, find our power, find our heart and  have the courage to risk again and again for  a more human world.  KINESIS //////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////^^^^  Theory  Andrea Dworkin  In the best radical feminist tradition  by Debby Gregory  I've been immersing myself in the work  of Andrea Dworkin, occasioned by her  September talk at the University of Victoria. Manhattan Island intensity met Vancouver Island serenity, and none of us wUl  ever again be the same.  In the best radical feminist tradition,  Dworkin's work poses a series of questions  rather than presenting many answers. She  has been instrumental in the development of  feminist critiques of pornography and prostitution, particularly by showing how sexual  violence against women is structuraUy central to our oppression rather than an accidental accompaniment. Her work has been  equaUy controversial within the Women's  Liberation Movement and the patriarchal  culture against—and within—which we operate.  I have some reservations about, disagreement with, and even, I confess, a certain  lack of interest in some of her conclusions,  but no woman should deprive herself of  the passionate intelligence which Dworkin  brings to her Ulumination of our condition.  One of the questions femimsts keep asking ourselves over the years is, "Why do men  hate us so much?" Dworkin explores both  why and how we are hated by men, and how  this hatred makes male violence against us  both possible and inevitable.  Her best work is essentiaUy phUosophi-  cal rather than polemical. She starts from  the premise that social reality is constructed  rather than natural. The social reality we aU  experience is constructed under conditions  of male supremacy; aU knowledge, aU definitions are coloured by that reality. "Male"  and "female" are real categories of existence, but only because male supremacy requires extremes of polarity between men  and women. Male laws create and sustain  male dominance. Male laws create gender.  Sexism is not treatment of some neutral  persons differently due to gender, but "...  is properly defined as the systematic cultural, pohtical, social, sexual, psychological,  and economic servitude of women to men  and to patriarchal institutions ..." (Our  Blood Feminism must go far beyond notions of women's equahty with men, to pursue real pohtical freedom:  • In my view, those of us who are women  inside this system of reahty wiU never be  free untU the delusion of sexual polarity  is destroyed and untU the system of reality based on it is eradicated entirely from  human society and from human memory.  This is the notion of cultural transformation at the heart of feminism. This is the  revolutionary possibiUty inherent in the  feminist struggle.  -Our Blood  In order to answer the question "Why do  men hate us?" Dworkin looks at the meaning of being a woman under conditions of  male supremacy. What she finds is harrowing. Pornography is what women are (defines our basic meaning to men); prostitution is what women do (is how we as a  class manage economicaUy to hve, either as  wives or as sex-trade workers); rape, battery, economic exploitation and reproductive exploitation—what Dworkin calls the  'circle of crimes' against us—explains what  women are for (our functions in society).  Gender oppression intersects with racial  and economic oppression to determine individual women's positions within our overaU  subordination to men.  Not a pretty picture, and it gets worse.  Woman's inequality reduces her to a sexual object. As a sexual object she has power  over men, who desire her. She provokes male  rage because men experience their desire as  disempowering: thus they can never completely oppress women, and consequently  reheve their frustration by hurting us as  much as is within their power.  Why does woman's inequality reduce her  to a sexual object? Because "Men need inequality in order to fuck" (Intercourse)  Male homosexuals function the same way,  merely substituting other men for women.  This usage by some gay men of other men  as though they were women provokes rage  among heterosexuals because they think  only women should be treated that way.  Less Than Human  In her exploration of the meaning of sexual  intercourse within male supremacy,  Dworkin looks at what it means for women  that our bodies represent a lack of physical  integrity aUowed men and included in their  definition of human being. She finds that  women are considered less than human—  and she finds that intolerable. Dworkin sees  one standard of human freedom and dignity for men and quite another for women.  Instead of pursuing truth, justice and the  American Way, women are enjoined to seek  freedom and dignity in male-defined sexuahty and motherhood. "What does it mean  to be the person...who needs to be wanted  more than she needs integrity or freedom or  equahty?" (Intercourse)  In Right- Wing Women, Dworkin posits  that every woman essentially takes a look  at our conditions, and "...seeing the disdain  of men for women's hves, and not wanting to die—and not wanting to die—  women propose two very different solutions  for themselves..." We can struggle to change  those conditions (the feminist solution) or  we can accommodate to them as best we can  (the right-wing or anti-feminist solution).  Right-wing women give particular meanings to what all women see. Given rape, they  prefer negotiating with one man rather than  many. Given low wages and low working  status, they prefer economic dependency  on one man rather than on the market  place. Given coercive sexuahty, they prefer  chastity. Given battery, they prefer religious  marriage vows. Seeing that our reproductive  capabilities are what give us worth, they try  to increase the value of mothering as a full-  time occupation. Seeing that access to legal  abortion means that men don't have to be  accountable for their sexual exploitation of  women, they opt for criminalization of abortion.  Right-wing women see the situation as  "closed and inalterable" and look to men for  protection. The flaw in their logic is that the  home is the least safe place for women. But  when right-wing women look at feminists,  they just see powerless women, and they feel  safer casting their lot with powerful men,  with whom they can negotiate on a one-to-  one basis. "Because feminism is a movement  for hberation of the powerless by the powerless in a closed system based on their powerlessness, right-wing women judge it a futile movement."  I have to question whether Dworkin's  model of female oppression, carefully articulated in the last chapter of Right-Wing  Women, doesn't contribute to this feehng  of futility. Her model is so totaUy closed  and aU-encompassing, it makes aU hope of  overcoming oppression seem vague indeed.  H male dominance is the source of aU reality and ah value and aU meaning, then we  have hteraUy no way of breaking out of the  circle of crimes against women.  Even our rebeUions wUl mean what men  want them to mean. Our writings, our actions, our struggles in the workplace, in the  law courts, in the hospitals, in the schools,  and in our homes, wUl inevitably be understood primarily and perhaps solely in the  hght of how men can maintain their power.  Dworkin herself clearly doesn't consider  the situation hopeless, as her continued vigorous activism and scholarship attest. She  feels we can break through the closed circle, and we start by tapping into that bit  of each of us that the patriarchy has not  conquered. If manhood feeds off masochistic womanhood, we can stop surrendering  as the first step to eliminating manhood. H  society tells us 'every day in every way' that  because we are women we are not worth  much, we can counterpose our accumulated  feminist knowledge and wisdom to insist on  our human worth and dignity.  At the end of Right-Wing   Women,  Dworkin invites each of us to consider: "The  freedom of women from sex oppression either matters or it does not; it is either essential or it is not. Decide one more time."  Dworkin's books include Woman Hating, Our Blood, Right-Wing Women, Ice  and Fire, and Intercourse. If you only  have time for one, I'd recommend  Right-Wing Women, but you really should  read Ice and Fire: it's the novel men always said women couldn't write, and  when she wrote it, they wouldn't publish  it.

What if  a painting looked hke a quilt? These questions were addressed in a recent exhibit at  the Vancouver Women in Focus gallery.  Would You Put This On Your Bed?"  brought together quilts by Wendy Lew  ington-Coulter and paintings by Debbie  Bryant. Although in entirely different media, their works echoed each other's in interesting ways.  Lewington-Coulter, a Clearbrook fabric  artist, is conscious of her place in a long  history of women who have stitched social  and pohtical commentary into their quilts.  Her work is an extremely effective blending  of this traditional medium and strictly contemporary themes.  In Home Sweet Home, for instance,  pretty, tidy images of houses march across a  dark background. So far, so traditional. Yet  each row of houses is separated from the  next by a short statement/statistic about  wife battering in Canada. Together the images and words dehver a strong, unsetthng  statement.  Small Change also refers to women.  Here, images of women's hands at various  types of work imply that the kinds of work  women do have not changed much over  time. This quilt demonstrates Lewington-  Coulter's consummate use of colour and  pattern, as does a striking quilt titled Tea  Party.  A simple image of a teacup and saucer is  the motif, repeated in aU the vibrant colours  of the rainbow. Patterns range from tartan  to floral to brocade to fluorescent, but the  whole quilt is artfully balanced.  No, but maybe on my bed  by Naomi Pauls  Tea Party does not have the strong  poUtical message of some of Lewington-  Coulter's quilts; it stems from something  more personal. To me it expresses a joyful  respect for the tea ritual, a traditionally domestic and female pursuit.  In a similar way, Lewington-Coulter's  works express a profound appreciation and  Fruit, for instance, is very quUt-Uke in  its repetition of the same image within  "blocks." Its border of small triangles, another quUting reference, reoccurs in several  of Bryant's works. Yet when taken to the  extreme, as in this work, the quUt form  translates only into pattern on paper, not  great art. The technique is more effective in  a work hke Quitting Coffee, when Bryant  uses the idea of a quilt as a starting-point  for her own creativity.  In other paintings Bryant uses simple images to great effect. Cait's Flowers, on  the one hand, has a chUdish innocence. Yet  the image of a plain white house, repeated  over and over against a blood-stained background, gives Blood on the Streets of  Soweto dramatic, worldly impact. The simple images employed in the Prickly Path  series have a haunting, mythic resonance.  My favourite work of Bryant's in the  show does not borrow from the quilting tradition. Again, it has a more personal reference; a portrait of Bryant's mother, titled  Mama. A simple but moving image, it portrays a woman in a 50s-era dress, holding  an evergreen branch.  Mama is one of Bryant's softer works,  not all jagged edges and boxes. Yet, whether  personal, humorous, symbohc or pohtical,  her works are those of an artist continually  challenging herself (and her viewers) with  fresh artistic statements.  "Would You Put This On Your Bed?'  was sensitively curated by Sima Elizabeth  Shefrin. It juxtaposed the works of two talented artists who refuse to be strictly defined. Both Lewington-Coulter and Bryant  stretch the limits of their chosen media to  dehver powerful, contemporary statements.  ,   Canadian first  Stephanie likes Anne  Bryant and Lewington-Coulter.  by Bonnie Waterstone  S.P.

These novels feature  teenagers coming to terms with everything  from moving to a new school to suicide,  rape and alcohohsm. The protagonist, often  a strong young woman, is usually between  15 and 18 years old. The reader is usuaUy  between 11 and 14: teenagers hke to read  about older teenagers.  Annie On My Mind, by Nancy Garden, has for years been the recognized young  adult novel dealing with lesbianism. Published in New York in 1982, this novel can  be found in any school or public library  wanting the standard book for teens on this  topic.  Compared to Annie On My Mind,  S.P. Likes A.D. is rather shght. Annie  is a much richer story, with weU-developed  characters and serious conflict. S.P. Likes  A.D. could easily be read by an 11 year-  old; Annie is more demanding, more of a  love story and more traumatic: when the  two teenage girls are discovered in bed, both  they and the lesbian teachers who have befriended them get in deep trouble.  Stephanie also has older mentors who she  meets through a roundabout set of circumstances. Stephanie loves bones and wants to  be a paleontologist. She enters the school  contest for the design of a sculpture to be  erected outside the school and to her surprise, she wins. Her sculpture is a dinosaur  head made from various dinosaur bones.  Stephanie is overwhelmed by the idea of actually executing this sculpture.

This  reading and question and answer session  is Drabble's last engagement on the Canadian leg of a North American tour to promote her new novel, A Natural Curiosity, sequel to the best-seUing The Radiant  Way. The Arts Club Theatre on GranvUle  Island, set up for a production of Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors as a classic western (the footlights are transformed  into bleached cattle skulls), is packed.  Drabble, at one time an actor with the  Royal Shakespeare Company, projects her  middle-class South Yorkshire tones across  the bleached skulls, enunciates clearly as she  reads an excerpt from the new novel describing the unredeemed, appaUing condition of a service station and restaurant on  the British motorway to Dover (appalUng is  a word she hkes) and a more acceptable (to  some) sexual pickup on the ferry to Calais.  Promoters of the new, prosperous Britain  of the 80's object to the relentless realism  of her writing. She relates that she has recently learned to drive and divides her time  between houses in London and Somerset,  spending considerable time on motorways  and in service stations.  Margaret Drabble has spoken before of  the value of motherhood and given it some  credit for her insight as a writer. Now she  reacts satisfactorUy to questions about her  chUdren. She would love to talk about them:  a daughter is in publishing; a son is a pohtical analyst (much too compUcated for her  to understand); another son has never read  her books.  She responds to questions about her  writing habits: she grew up with a work  ethic—one feels Margaret Thatcher would  approve-so writes every morning and afternoon, then goes for a walk or drive and  watches teUy in the evening. She wrote The  Radiant Way in a httle more than a year.  She, hke Liz Headleand of A Natural Curiosity, has a tabby cat; she, hke her character Esther Breuer, once left a house plant  to die on the front porch. The audience of  women and the odd man loves the demys-  tification of the writer's hfe. This is a successful performance.  Later she signs books, responds flawlessly  to comments on her work and to requests  for messages to future recipients of signed  copies (congratulations on your Phd). The  final chore of the afternoon turns out to be  an interview with Kinesis, bumped down  from the previous day in favour of The  Globe and Mail and scheduled right after  a Seattle radio station that features something called The British Hour. The reporter (male) shows interest in Kinesis,  and makes a note to look for a copy.  This is an internationaUy famous writer  whose hand I am about to shake. I am  nervous but not excessively so. I am, I  reckon, mature enough to approach Margaret Drabble as an equal. I, too, once hved  in Hampstead in an Edwardian vUla but in  very different circumstances. Drabble is gracious but tired and somewhat wary, the eyes  those of Henry James' perpetual observer.  I quickly abandon the idea of equahty and  consult my hst of questions.  Drabble admits that Virginia Woolf is  an important influence. The party scenes in  The Radiant Way and A Natural Curiosity had their genesis in the "promiscuous party" (Woolfs phrase) at the end  of The Years. Other influences on Drabble's earlier writing are Doris Lessing, An  gus WUson (a great writer, much neglected)  and Saul BeUow. "Not aU women," she em-  She is interested, as a writer of fiction, in  the social history of England. "It is important to chronicle things as they are. Useful to get things down, to capture what is  happening rather than what people think is  happening. Other media, tv and radio and  historians in particular, are fuU of disinformation."  A Spontaneous Reaction  Drabble cites the second world war as a  great repressant of feminist activity. Educated women with high expectations found  that hfe after the war was not equal as had  been promised. There came a spontaneous  reaction to the social situation, a questioning of the status quo by women as diverse as  Doris Lessing and Sylvia Plath and, in the  At 50, Margaret Drabble  is "fed-up" with  agonizing self-analysis.  ing the role of Shirley Harper, a provincial housewife, Drabble is able, through the  diversity of her characters and their natural curiosity, to explore dangerous pathways. Humanity can transcend murder, suicide, madness, middle-age, even indifference  as long as curiosity remains.  Not aU characters are human. The tech  nological environment takes on a hfe of its  own: Shirley, trapped on the circular motorway, is "sucked into a car-park." Life is circular, but the circle opens up occasionally  to let you off to try a new option. Shirley's  is the rediscovery, in middle age, of her sexuality.  Please see Drabble page 18  early 60's, the irreverent, iconoclastic Edna  O'Brien and others. Feminist hterary criticism made connections between fiction, sociology and poUtics. Women ceased to write,  as Lessing and Plath had done, in isolation.  Drabble describes her present relationship  with Lessing, O'Brien, Fay Weldon, Beryl  Bainbridge and other writers as having a  "colleaguely, camaraderly feeUng."  She defends the fictional world of affluent, educated women she creates for her  novels in two ways: firstly, she writes from  the middle class stance to which she considers working class women should aspire.  "My mother was working class, and I'm  middle class. And that's a natural progression." Secondly, few so-called working class  women read books anyway. She would be a  fool to write romance fiction.  As for the problem of poor women identifying with her characters: "Women are  so feeble! If they want money, they must  make it...If I'm doing badly, I should change  it myself." This is the voice of the independent, pragmatic woman from Yorkshire  who, at 23, typed her first novel holding a  baby on her knee. It is also an echo of Margaret Thatcher, with whom she seems to  have come to terms.  She is a feminist "of course!" But not  a separatist. Men and women inhabit the  same world and should try hard to get  along. The pornography bUl now before  Britain's parliament is a complex question  for femimsts. She does not know what to  think. She is not personaUy offended by, for  example, pin-up pictures in factories. They  do not necessarUy lead to violence, simply  represent what factory workers do. She is  hopeful about women. "Their Uves are better than they've ever been."  At 50, Margaret Drabble is "fed-up" with  agonizing self-analysis. The ageing process  interests her but not obsessively. Maturity  gives her a broad view, an ironic detachment  certainly reflected in A Natural Curiosity.

SATURDAY,     NOVEMBER    4-  2   -   a   pivi  KINESIS ;s^s$*^**^**ss*s^  ARTS  Hitting the system  and hitting it hard  by Maura Volante  Three young women and a man came  to the Vancouver Folk Music Festival from  Toronto last summer with some hardhitting messages wrapped up in a rap style.  Tissa FarreU, Thando Hyman, M.C. Motion and D.J. Power made a strong impression, not only with their talented dehvery in  this style they caU hip hop, but also with the  strength of their commitment to sweeping  changes in the world, for Blacks, for women,  for youth, for aU oppressed people. They  have that certainty of youth; they know the  right way to go.  As M.C. Motion, otherwise known as  Wendy, said, "We are doing this to educate,  to relocate aU the minds of the young people out there who are going the wrong way.  We're here to help them and show them  where to go."  They don't want to limit themselves to  reaching Black youth. Said Wendy, "1 feel  that we're addressing our stuff to aU youth.  We may hit in on a lot of Black youth because that's the main problem these days.  A lot of Black youth are being hit by the  system."  Thando went on, "But if we can also educate young white people as weU it only  makes our struggle much easier, because  people can understand what we're going  through. If you don't tell them, obviously  they're not going to know."  Hip hop may seem at first out of place  at a folk festival, but not when you consider its origins—the street. According to  D.J. Power (Derek, to his friends), hip hop  is "street urban music that came out of New  York during the disco age. It incorporates  rap, but hip hop could be the beats without  the rap."  Wendy continued, saying, "Hip hop describes the non-commercial part of rap, I  would think. Rap is more broad, because  you can rap to any music. But hip hop is  the real street sound."  Though it may not be obvious to those  whose exposure to rap is limited to commercial airplay, there is a whole network  of pohtical rappers, both in the US and in  Toronto, where issues such as the pohce brutality towards the Black community have  mobUized a large resistance.  It was through this movement that dub  poet/musician Lillian AUen came into contact with these four. Derek and Wendy are  part of Unity Productions—another hip hop  group—and Thando and Tissa have been  doing hip hop shows as weU. It was AUen  who suggested the four get a show together  for the folk festival.  Although their folk festival performances  reflected the more serious side of their  repertoire—pieces about pohce shootouts,  apartheid, the struggles of Black women and  youth—they pointed out they do "fun raps"  as weU. They are also very aware of the biases of the media, in terms of airplay and  acknowledgement.  Wendy described it hke this: "They hsten more to the young guys who are talking about the girl next door than to the guy  who's talking about the girl next door plus  her brother, plus her whole family which is  poor and doesn't have food to eat. Whenever a rapper is being bitten by the media,  hke the media are saying they're very bad,  pro-violence and anti-white, then I go and  check them out, because I know they must  be saying something that's hitting the system and hitting it hard."  Not surprisingly, they aU learned their  pohtical lessons from parents active in  the pohtical Black community. And unhke many adolescent chUdren of white activists, they have never felt the need to rebel  against the pohtical directions of their parents, as they hve much closer to the realities of the struggle. Thando explained, "In  a sense, we're rebeUing against society, because we're not saying something that is  commonly said."  In terms of their peers, they spoke of recent events being an eye-opener for Black  youth.  "Nobody could be bhnd enough not to  see it," said Tissa. "As soon as a 17-year-  old, Wade Lawson [a Black man in Toronto]  was kUled by pohce in December, that is  when a lot of youth reaUy got together and  opened their eyes. After that, there's no way  you can be isolated when you talk about the  motherland, about pohce brutality, about  pride."  Said Wendy, "A lot of youth are wearing the colours of the motherland—the red,  gold, green and black, and the pendants—  everything that shows Africa. That's good  because it's showing that they are realizing  who they are and being proud of who they  not African.' Now they're telling you about  what the colours mean, about the oldest  university in Africa—and hke that."  The three women in the group also show  pride in being women, although they did not  seem to see feminism as the major issue for  them. "For instance," said Tissa, "we have  a song called 'Black Woman' that I wrote,  promoting pride in being Black and being  a woman. Wanting to take more charge of  yourself and not being put down by society."  Thando also wrote a song on this theme  (at the age of 10) called"Who Is She?". As  she put it, "We as Black women suffer a  triple oppression."  Wendy wanted to point out that "women's issues are one thing, but even though  we're women, we wouldn't let it hit us in  the sky, because there are other things going on. When you continuaUy hang onto this  one issue, other things wUl come and go,  and nothing wUl be done about them. So  we realize that there's a struggle between  women and society, but as weU as fighting  for women's rights, we also fight for rights  of people, period, when injustice is done.  "Only then when we hit on those big issues, then we can tack in the smaU ones and  then everything wUl be just as we want it  to be, perfect."  Drabble from page 17  Drabble may have a detached view of her  material, but knows she must involve her  reading audience. The narrative voice intrudes occasionaUy to instruct readers what  to pay attention to: "you do not have to retain these names" and to admonish them  to take responsibility for the events of the  novel, to help to control and manipulate  the cast of characters and, by implication,  to consider the future of the world: "...you  might reflect that it might be your task, not  mine...to offer...a satisfactory resolution."  Drabble's temporary solution to Shirley's  problems is the introduction, in the final  pages, of a half sister ex machina, a device worthy of any soap opera (or romance  novel). Having established in the three  friends a rueful love and hope for England—  that "clapped-out, shabby land"—Drabble  concludes the novel in Italy, an appropriate  place to "see into the past and future."  She is not, however, finished yet. She has  despatched one of her characters to Kampuchea (Cambodia) to write a play about  Pol Pot, the genocidal leader of the Khmer  Rouge. The final volume of Drabble's trilogy may take her there to explore the dehu-  manization of a different society. Margaret  Drabble has the courage, perception and intelligence to "chronicle things as they are."  The row of skulls lighting the stage at the  Arts Club theatre may, after all, be significant in her circular universe.  The Radiant Way is available in a  Collins paperback edition at%5.95. A  Natural Curiosity is published by McLel-  land and Stewart at $24.95. Both  are enormously entertaining, absorbing, readable and re-readable.  S.P. from page 16  To the rescue comes Kate Burton, a retired paleontologist friend of her mother  Stephanie discovers Kate hves with Mary  and when she snoops in their home, she sees  they only have one bedroom with one double bed. Stephanie "found it a httle exciting, and for one brief, splendid moment she  had a vision of herself and Anne Delaney  hving in one room and sleeping in one bed."  That's about as close as Stephanie comes  to having a fantasy about herself and Anne  UsuaUy she's just confused. Her feehngs are  "strong, powerful." She feels attracted to  Anne, the way her best friend Devi is attracted to Eric.  This book wUl be read—and enjoyed  for content rather than style. The pace is  slow and there's not much action. There's  no terrible trauma, only Stephanie's inner  turmoU. The short sentences, big print and  briefness wiU attract pre-teen and young  teen readers.  Stephanie and her older brother hve  with their mom and dad who both work—  the standard heterosexual nuclear family.  Stephanie tests out her family's reaction to  lesbianism by talking about her new friends  and assistants on her sculpture project.  "How long has Mary been Uving with  Kate?" Stephanie wants to know. "About  25 years, I think", rephes her mom.  To make a long conversation short,  Stephanie discovers her mom is accepting. Her father thinks it's unnatural and  a matter for concern and maybe Stephanie  shouldn't be aUowed to go there, and her  brother is mUdly curious. We know that  mother's reasonableness wUl prevaU.  By the end of the book, Stephanie has  been able to talk about some of her feehngs  with her new friends Kate and Mary. She  gets a surprise when she finally tells her best  friend Devi. Anne Delaney becomes less important, as Stephanie begins to understanc  and accept herself.  The Women's Press is to be congratulated for bringing out a Canadian novel that]  presents such a thoughtful and positive view  of lesbianism for the young reader.  18 KINESIS  Thando Hyman, Tissa Farrell, M.C. Motion and D.J. Power AmmazzMmmsmmmMli  Publishers in pain  Triple whammy for feminists  by Michele Valiquette  Canadian culture, Canadian readers and  Canadian women aU have pretty low priority on Brian Mulroney's corporate agenda.  Never has this been clearer than in the  budget tabled this spring by finance minister Michael WUson. While hacking at social  programs with one hand, WUson launched a  massive attack on Canadian publishing with  the other.  Plans to reduce postal subsidies for magazines and newspapers and to add a hefty  new tax to reading pose serious threats to  Canadian magazines in general. Add to that  severe cuts in funding to women's programs  and you've got a declaration of war on feminist periodicals in particular. It'U take the  combined resources of the feminist publishing community—along with vigorous community support—to come through this one.  straightforward. Increased costs cut straight  to the bone. They can mean fewer issues  per year, fewer pages per issue and an even  greater than usual reliance on volunteer  labour.  Whether large or smaU, most publications wUl have httle choice but to add at  least some of the additional postage expense  to their cover prices.  Rising costs wUl be compounded by another item on the Conservative agenda: a  tax on nearly ail goods and services (the  GST)—including reading materials and every stage of the magazine's production  process. The higher overhead could easily  translate into further price hikes and an already beleaguered reader hit yet again with  the nine percent tax at the newsstand and  on subscriptions.  Many analysts predict a sharp upward  turn in inflation as a result of the GST.  it wasn't long before a vocal right-wing  minority... began exerting pressure on  government funders.   First, postal subsidies. Like many other  magazine readers, I didn't really pay much  attention to these untU WUson announced  his government's intention to slash them.  But discounted maUing rates to publishers  have long been a crucial factor in the Canadian periodical trade. For more than 100  years, the subsidies have eased the task of  distributing to this country's small, widely  dispersed readerships by making it less expensive.  One of the underlying ideas here has been  that aU Canadians—no matter how far they  Uve from publishing centres—should have  access to the printed word. Another idea is  that Canadian culture is worth fostering.  Without some form of subsidy most  Canadian publications would have Uttle  chance offending off fierce competition from  American magazines. These already make  up 90 percent of the periodicals sold on  our newsstands. Most enjoy a huge economic advantage: they've recovered aU of  their costs in a large home market before  they even cross our border. The sales they  make in Canada are pure profit.  The immediate financial effects of the  subsidy cut could be devastating for Canadian magazines: one study estimates that if  they're eliminated, postal expenses wUl rise  by more than 500 percent. To put that in  perspective: it could take between $5 and  $6 dollars more per year simply to maU out  each Kinesis subscription.  Print giants hke Maclean's fear the subsidy loss wiU put a dent in their profit  margins if they absorb the extra expense,  or damage their abiUty to hold their own  against foreign magazines if they pass it on  to readers.  For feminist publications, who operate on  miniscule budgets, who don't have profit  margins, and who are sensitive to their  readers' Umited means, the matter is more  Women readers in particular wUl feel the  impact. They make up not only the majority of the country's low wage earners—the  group Ukely to be struck most severely by  the overaU effect of the tax—but the majority of its magazine and book buyers.  Our dollars simply aren't going to stretch  far enough. Magazine prices could weU be  pushed out of reach, and the net result of  the new tax would be to make reading a luxury. A curious move for a government that  just one year ago was noisUy proclaiming its  commitment to hteracy.  The GST and the postal increases alone  have many Canadian magazines seriously  questioning their ability to survive. But  there's a third dimension to the onslaught  for those who read and produce feminist periodicals, one of which has received far less  attention.  That's the two million dollars slashed  from the federal Secretary of State Women's  Program this fiscal year, and the fear that  at least that much wUl be cut again in  the spring of 1990. Not only do such cuts  threaten the survival of many feminist  groups, they put a huge hole in the budgets of the publications that extend their  work. While neither the GST nor the cuts  to postal subsidies have been implemented  yet, the government wasted precious httle  time before moving on women.  Feminist periodicals can't compete with  large circulation, mainstream publications  for advertising dollars. Most of our revenue comes from subscriptions, donations  and grants. Over the years, the Secretary of  State (Sec State) has made some money—  not a lot—avaUable for projects such as  special issues or subscription drives and, in  a few cases, for ongoing operations. These  funds have helped some publications become more or less firmly established.  In 1985, SecState funds made up nearly  15 percent of the total budgets of the  country's femimst periodicals. In the same  year additional dollars were made avaUable  for a national conference. Our communications network seemed to be growing, gaining strength.  Our success may even be part of the  problem we're dealing with now. We were  noticed, and it wasn't long before a vocal  right-wing minority—anti-choice and anti-  lesbian—began exerting increasing pressure  on government funders. Some publications  are feehng that impact very directly in the  current battle.  Kinesis is a case in point. At a July  meeting with SecState bureaucrats, the  Vancouver Status of Women, Kinesis' publisher, was told the editor's position will be  next on the chopping block. Why? Because  our stand on abortion and on lesbianism  makes it difficult for them to continue to  "support us", they said, and they're sure we  don't want interference.  This isn't the first time government funders have flexed their muscle in this way.  A second feminist periodicals conference,  scheduled to take place in summer 1987, was  canceUed in the planning stages and a similar rationale offered. The trend doesn't bode  weU for the future.  So now I've come to the hardest part of  this article. Where do we go from here?  In the face of such a heavy handed and  multi-directional attack, proposals for action might weU seem puny. So think of what  foUows as an invitation to a broader discussion. I don't beheve we're going to sit quietly and take this. And we've got to start  somewhere.  Feminist pubUcations may be a lot  smaUer than Saturday Night or Chatelaine but we've got an advantage they  don't. Our readers are not a group of consumers targetted for quick sale to advertisers. Feminist publications grow out of—and  create vital links within—a pohtical movement. We're sustained in a whole variety of  ways by a community of activists.  Now more than ever we have to draw  and buUd on that support. Feminist periodicals need regular, committed readers. Anything that broadens that base wiU increase  our strength and ultimately the strength of  the women's movement. The work can be as  easy as showing a favourite periodical to a  friend, buying her a subscription, or asking  the local library to add the title to its coUection. Taking out a subscription (it's amazing how many readers don't have one) or  renewing early also helps. Pubhc librarians  are often receptive to community requests,  especially if there's more than one of them.  Subscriptions and the money they bring  in are only one (albeit crucial) form of support. Feminist pubUcations also need participation from newswriters, reviewers, interviewers, photographers and production people. If you don't know how, we can teach  you.  The bureaucrats at SecState seem to  think we're a pernicious influence on the one  hand, but that nobody really reads us on  the other. A deluge of letters and calls to  MPs and to Secretary of State Gerry Weiner  might help them see otherwise. (House of  Commons, Ottawa, Ontario, KlA 0A6).  And whUe you're at it, let Michael Wilson  know what you think of the postal subsidy  cut and the tax on reading.  Help Save  CANADA'S MAGAZINES!  They are a voice of our own.

KINESIS Letters  More on domestic workers  Kinesis:  We are writing to clear up the confusion created by the article "The Trappings of Domestic Work", which appeared  in your Oct./89 issue. The article confused  two groups and credited the activities of the  West Coast Domestic Workers Association to the CoaUtion for Domestic Workers' Rights.  To set the record straight: the West  Coast Domestic Workers Association is a  non-profit society run by domestic workers, working with the help of associated  community members. We celebrated our  third anniversary in October, 1989. Since  1986 we have provided domestics with information and support through monthly  meetings, a monthly newsletter and a telephone helpline. We hold free workshops on  such topics as immigration and employment  rights, income tax, sexual harassment and  racial discrimination.  We also lobby the provincial and federal  governments on issues of concern fo domestics. At present, we are preparing a brief to  be submitted to Immigration concerning its  review of the Foreign Domestic Worker Program. We are also publishing a Handbook  on Domestic Workers' Rights, which we  expect wUl be avaUable by the end of this  year.  The CoaUtion for Domestic Workers'  Rights was formed last June for the purpose of uniting a number of community organizations, together with the West Coast.  Domestic Workers Association, to lobby the  provincial and federal governments around  the issue of landed immigrant status. The  main event of the coalition took place on  September 17, when close to 300 domestic workers attended the panel discussion  on Domestic Workers* Rights at Robson  Square.
