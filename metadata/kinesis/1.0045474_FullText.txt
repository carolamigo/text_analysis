Lcr&jt.  APRIL 80  01  KiMESiS  news about women that's not in the dailies  Sylvie Beauregard LOCAL MOVEMENT  Thanks to your tremendous support, we 're still here!  VSW vindicated in Victoria, but City Hall appeal is April 29  By Debra Lewis  First, the good news. VSW is in business  for another year. In mid-March, we received notice from the Provincial Secretary  that we would be receiving a grant of  $86,700 for the coming year. It's positive  news in that we have received the first  increase in dollar terms since we began receiving provincial funds in 1974. Obviously, the increase will help compensate for  inflation over the past year. However,  even this increase is still woefully inadequate to make up for cutbacks we have  had to make in the past.  Our fight at city hall, however, still continues. On March 4, City Council turned  down the recommendation of the Social  Planning Department that VSW be granted  $9,920 (one-half of our request) to reinstate an advocacy service for women. VSW's  ombudservice was discontinued in 1978 due  to staff cutbacks and the unwillingness of  the provincial government to fund this type  of service. It is becoming more and more  clear, however, that women in Vancouver  rely on us for assistance in a variety of  social services and legal areas. We believe that it is essential that City Council recognize the important contribution  we make to women in Vancouver. Without  some tangible support from Council, operating an effective advocacy service is virtually impossible.  Alderwoman Bernice Gerard has led a cam  paign against our funding on the grounds  that we have policies advocating pro-choice  on abortion and protection of rights of  lesbians and gay men. She has made it  clear that she realizes that we perform  other important services for women in Vancouver, but that we must be made an example  of. In effect, she wants to punish VSW and  the women who use our services and programs  because of her personal disagreement with  two of our policies.  VS W is having an OPEN  HOUSE April 25 and you are  invited!  We have been encouraged by the level of  support we have had from women's groups,  individuals in the community, and in the  press. We are appealing the decision of  council and need your support in this process.  Our appeal date is April 29 at 7:30 in the  evening. This is what you can do in the  meantime:  * call those members of City Council who  voted against our funding and tell them  that women need the kind of advocacy service we propose. Those who voted against  us are Mayor Volrich,.and Alderpersons  Bernice Gerard, Doug Little, George Puil  and Warnett Kennedy.  * write to Council and let them know you  support VSW. Send us a copy of the letter  or send it directly to us and we will make  a copy before sending it on. Have any  organization you may be involved in write  letters, too. Letters should be addressed  to The Mayor and Members of Council, City  Hall, 453 W. 12th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.  * come to the Council meeting on April 29  at 7:30 in the Council chambers at City  Hall. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. In addition, VSW is holding an open house and  celebration of our provincial funding  on Friday, April 25 from 3 - 7 p.m. at  the YSVf offices, 1090 W. 7th. We hope  that you will come and re-acquaint  yourselves with our services and programs,  as well as just have a good time. We  also intend to invite members of Council  to attend to see what we really do. It  should be noted that none of those who  voted against our grant have ever visited our office or even called to find out  information on what we do.  We need to change two votes in order to  get the funding we need for the advocacy  service. Although we have a majority of  support on Council (the vote was 6 to 5),  eight affirmative votes are needed for a  community grant. Hopefully, with your  support we can win. Q  Welfare advocacy is now being organized in Vancouver  By Cole Dudley  A system of welfare advocacy is finally  emerging in Vancouver. Previously, there  have been individuals who worked with, and  for, welfare recipients. Now welfare recipients and otner concerned individuals  have joined together to form the Welfare  Action Coalition.  The need for this is clear to anyone, who is  on, or who has worked with Human Resources  programs. People on assistance are denied  access to information about their rights.  A booklet on GAIN rights is available from  the office of the Ministry of Human Resources, but it mainly deals with routine financial situations.. When irregularities arise  (such as extra money, family or court matters, discrepancies over policy or treatment ) most people do not know where they  stand or how to find out their rights.  This seems paradoxical for a system that  exists for the benefit of powerless people.  The problem of discovering your rights  grows with the inconsistency of information that seeps out from the MHR offices.  One person receives aid with her education,  another is refused; one receives family  care and another is not even told she has  that alternative. These situations, and  others, occur repeatedly.  Why does it happen? Aren't the supervisors  and social workers told about policy and  policy changes? And if they are told, why  don't they share this knowledge with their  clients?  To answer these questions we must realize  the social worker's position. MHR workers  are put in a position that wields power  over people who feel like victims at the  outset. The workers are able to interpret  policy according to their own personal  biases and sometimes intimidate their clients right out of the office or into inaction.  This is not true of all workers of cburse.  Some go out of their way to do all they  can for their clients. But these exceptional people soon become swamped and unable to give adequate personal attention  to each case. Consequently, misunderstand-  Placard portrays Grace McCarthy, minister of human resources,  as seen through the eyes of demonstrator  protesting "Human Resources Week".  ings occur due to lack of time (on the  worker's part) and lack of information (on  the client's part).  Many welfare recipients do not know and  are not told of some of their basic rights  — the right to homemakers to relieve  family stress, to babysitting while on VTP  grants, to a special financial worker, or  to earn an extra $100. a month.  Moreover, people on assistance are seldom  informed that they have the ability to  change workers if they experience antagonism' or lack of interest. Nor are they  told of their right to appeal a decision,  or of their right to challenge the minister  to reverse even the appeal result.  Information leads to knowledge. Knowledge  leads to power. Therefore, if welfare  recipients are to have some power over  their lives, they need a means to accumulate and...dispense information.  The. need is great for the Welfare Coalition  to not only inform people of their basic  rights, but also to study the welfare policies, andi^qrk towards raising them to  poverty leyels.  A system of" advocacy and information is  being structured now in various Vancouver  communities so people will feel more comfortable in approaching the ministry with  their needs.

Last year in Richmond: it was the final  day for applications for membership in  the Richmond Hospital Board Society if  you wanted to be eligible to vote in  the June annual general meeting elections. That day, the society was flooded  with 230 new membership applications.  At the annual general meeting, three new  members were elected to the board of Richmond General : Ken Andrews, Albert Fox  and Denis Wonderly. All are anti-choice.  This year there are three more seats on  the board coming up for election at the  annual general meeting. If anti-choicers  were.to scoop the pool, they'd have a  majority of six on an eleven-member board.  The Richmond Pro-Choice Movement is working to.counteract anti-choice single-issue  interference in the functioning of Richmond General Hospital.  Contact them at 685 4035 (leave a message).  Or write ^o them c/o Ms Bonnie Fidler,  11491 Williams Road, Richmond V6A 1J3.  Residents of Richmond are eligible to become members of the hospital society. Last .  day for applications: May 15.   Q   _- Kinesis April 80  RIGHT TO CHOOSE  Access to abortion diminishing in Victoria, protest growing  By Marine Boag  No abortions have been done at Victoria  General Hospital for over a month.  Their  abortion committee, which turned down all  but a few of the applications they received  in January and February, has had no, more  applications for four weeks. G.P.s are  sending all their abortion patients to  Royal Jubilee Hosptial (RJH).  Since the shutdown at Vic General, the  number of abortions being done at Jubilee  has increased 300 per cent; from 10 a week  to 30. Jubilee executive-director  Michael Butcher said: "We're already packed  to the rafters with people on waiting lists  This is certainly something we don't need.  I don't think we're prepared to do all  the abortions forever.  It's the kind of  thing no hospital enjoys doing, and we can't  be automatically expected to pick up the  extra load."  He said that if the situation goes on too  long, "the Board would have to set a new  policy on the issue."  The RJH Board chairman, Eric Simmons, said  the Jubilee will continue to do all the  abortions, at least until April.  "Our  position right now is to wait and see what  happens at Vic General."  The Vic General Board of directors has made  a series of attempts to override their  anti-abortion abortion committee, and restore the hospital's abortion services.  At their meeting last week, they passed a  motion appointing RJH's liberal committee  as the committee for Vic General, every  alternate month. This means that there  will be no abortions done at Vic General  during the months of May, July, September,  and November: but on every other month,  abortions approved by Jubilee's committee  will be done at Vic General.  Last year, when both committees shared the  same philosophy, they took turns monthly,  to consider applications for abortions to  be done in both hospitals. For the rest  of this year, the Jubilee committee will  continue to meet every week to consider  their abortion requests, during the months  of April, June, August, October and December, the abortions they approve can be  done at Vic General.  In 1979, Victoria General, with its modern  day-care unit, performed 725 abortions:  2/3 of the total at both hospitals.  The  hospital's high rate of abortions, combined with the medical staff's involvement in the coroner's inquest into an  abortion performed at 23 weeks on a mentally retarded woman led many doctors at  Vic General to feel that there were "too  many abortions being done." As one doctor  said: "In this province, one out of every  three pregnancies ends in abortion. B.C.  has the highest abortion rate in Canada:  that doesn't make me against abortion, but  I think we do too many."  Why B.C. has Canada's highest abortion  rate  There are many, reasons given to explain  B.C.'s high abortion rate. Historically,  the abortion repeal movement began in B.C.  The federal political debate to legalize  abortion in 1969 was led in the House by  two NDP MP's from this province. Figures  show that abortion has always been less  difficult to obtain in B.C.  In 1974,a  survey by the Federal department of health  showed that B.C. had a higher proportion of  accredited hospitals than any other province. A spokeswoman from the Canadian  Abortion Rights Action League said: "In  Afenitoba, where only two accredited hospitals perform a significant number of  abortions, 50$ of the Manitoban women  having abortions last year had to get them  in the States. B.C. has come the closest  of all the provinces to making Canada's  unworkable abortion law work."  Perhaps the two best explanations to  account for B.C.'s high abortion rate can  be found in simple demographic statistics.  Of all the provinces, B.C. has the most  mobile population; and an unstable lifestyle is not conducive to raising a family.  B.C. also has the lowest percentage of  Roman Catholics per capita of all the  provinces.  There is a statistically sig-  . nificant correlation between the number of  legal abortions and the percentage of  Catholics in the total population: the  higher the percentage of Catholics in the  population, the lower the number of abortions per 100 live births.  In a political  context, the greater the number of Catholics  in a province, the more powerful the church  is as a political institution.  Hospitals run by Catholic orders refuse to  provide abortion services, even when non-  Catholic physicians are prepared to abort  non-Catholic patients. Up until 1972,  when St. Joseph's Catholic Hospital became  Victoria General Hospital, no abortions  were done at all. Today there are still  many Catholic doctors on the staff.  The hospital's present therapeutic abortion  committee was chosen in December by the  hospital's medical director, Dr. Carlow,  and Dr. Shorting, chief of the medical staff.  The three men they selected were described  by a hospital administrator as "one  conservative, one liberal, and one middle-  of-the-roader." Four alternate doctors  were also chosen, two of whom were described by Dr. Carlow as "mildly pro-lifers."  The hospital board approved their committee  for their 12-month term of office, assuming,  as Cathy Mountain, a board member, said  "that they would follow the previous abortion committees' policies." But they  didn't. At their first two meetings in  January, the new committee turned down 27  of the 31 requests submitted. The "liberal member, Dr. Cooper, and the "conservative", Dr. Calder, voted as expected:  Dr. Ripley made an unexpected decision.  He said that as a GP he'd previously  "sent as many girls to the therapeutic  abortion committee as any doctor. Then  I'd wash my hands of the whole deal, saying its their decision. Now that I'm on  the abortion committee, it's my decision,  and I'm aware of ending the life of a  fetus."  The committee's rejections caused a flurry  of re-applications to Jubilee, which was  now required to do nearly all the city's  abortions. To ease the pressure on  Jubilee's facilities, the Vic General Board  at their January meeting, authorized the  Jubilee committee to consider applications  for abortions to be done at both hospitals.  This way, they could circumvent their anti-  abortion committee.  The Vic General committee responded with a  letter to the board, questioning the legality of the move. After consulting a solicitor, the board learned that it was not  possible for a hospital to have two therapeutic abortion committees working simultaneously, so on February 14, Vic General  declared a moratorium on abortions that  the Jubilee committee had approved.  At their February meeting, the board  managed to change the composition of the  committee, by requiring that their four  alternate members meet with them to decide on applications. The alternate  members, Doctors Joan Archibald, Thomas  Bailey, G. Ainsworth, and Lewis Harris,  have met and talked together, but have had  no applications to vote on. Dr. Cooper,  the committee's chairman, is optimistic  'that the additional doctors will have a  more liberal attitude. He thinks that the  board was right to leave the committee  alone and add the alternates.  "With four  more — although Dr. Harris will not be  available to meet with us — I think we  should get some reasonable applications  passed." Dr. Cooper's idea of a reasonable application would be one for a  woman whose method of contraception failed,  and he personally would have passed about  one-half of those applications originally  submitted. He thinks that Dr. Archibald,  the only woman on the committee, "is more  understanding, and likely to have a liberal  viewpoint." He hopes that his committee  will be "a little more liberal, and take  some of the load off Jubilee."  The medical staff at Vic General are apparently ambivalent over the issue. At one  meeting, they passed a motion that the  abortion committee should disband and a new  one be formed — but defeated a vote of  non-confidence in them. To clear the confusion, the medical staff executive committee decided to poll the active medical staff  (155 of the hospital's 400 doctors) on  whether they thought the actions of the  abortion committee were "appropriate" or  At Vic General:  ... if a woman has diabetes, multiple  sclerosis, cancer of the uterus, she  may be eligible for an abortion.  ... if a woman has three children, a  husband out of work, and is so depressed she can't sleep or look after  her children because of her distress  at being unwillingly pregnant, she  would not be able to have an abortion.  "too strict." The abortion committee simultaneously sent a letter to those being  polled, justifying their refusal to allow  abortions for "social or economic reasons",  and asking for their colleagues' support.  The responses to the poll were counted on  March 4 : 97 doctors replied - 54 supported  the committee, 43 thought they were too  strict, and 55 didn't respond at all.  The Canadian Abortion Rights Action League  protested about the poll, stating that the  doctors were being asked to evaluate the  committee's performance rather than to state  their opinions on the abortion issue.  Spokeswoman Jennifer Lowen said: "We know  of two pro-choice doctors - Jane Wright  and Frances Adey - who are on Vic General 's active medical staff, so were  eligible to vote, but did not receive any  voting papers. We wonder how many others  were left out, and why."  A Vic General doctor who voted to support  the committee saw the poll as a vote on  whether or not the hoard should be allowed  to interfere in the hospital's medical matters . "If we let the board overthrow an  abortion committee, then we'd be setting a  dangerous precedent, which, in the future,  could allow an anti-abortion board to intervene and throw out a pro-choice committ-  ee ' Turn to p. 19, col. 2 B.C. NEWS  BCFW will share benefits with Terrace, Rupert women's groups  By Maureen Bostock and Denise Still well  The BCFW Subcommittee on Violence Against  Women is holding a benefit dance on May 11  to observe Mothers' Day by raising funds  for northern women. Northwest Women In  Crisis has been named as one of two recipients of the proceeds of the benefit. We  have written the following article to give  women in the Lower Mainland a clearer picture of the conditions under which women  in the north live and work and the problems of organizing for change in northern  communities.  Northwest Women In Crisis Society offers  rape/assault, abortion and crisis counselling to women in Terrace and the  surrounding communities of Kitimat, Hazel-  ton, Smithers and Prince Rupert. The  counselling aspect of our work has always  been predominant as we are available to  women on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week.  We are funded by the provincial government  to operate this 24-hour line through our  provincial association, the Coalition of  B.C. Rape Centres.  A second function which we believe is  extremely important is the educational  work of offering rape awareness workshops  throughout the northwest region. These  workshops are intended to promote awareness of vulnerability and of what women  can do to protect themselves from violence. Furthermore, we provide self  defence training for women in Terrace and  intend to broaden this to include training  for women in other communities.  Needed: more women's organizations  Finally we see that as women involved in a  movement for social change we must encourage the development of other women's  organizations in the northwest so that the  women's movement in the northwest has a  broad framework — not one which is founded solely upon particular concerns but  which addresses all aspects of women's  oppression.  Northwest Women In Crisis was created in  November 1977. At that time we were a  small group of five women who tenaciously  engaged in developing an understanding of  each other, of the work we were taking on  and why it was important to us. We were  unskilled; none of us had ever before  worked collectively nor from a feminist  basis of unity. We had broad based support from the community which encouraged us  to continue struggling to develop a group  process and training ourselves to prepare  for the opening of the crisis line which  occured in July of 1978. Since then our  numbers have fluctuated, never exceeding  the numbers of the original members, and  it sometimes seems that the changes in  membership have hampered our development.  Today we are still confronting perhaps our  most serious problem. The size of northern communities imposes an inevitable restriction on the number of women who feel  they can make the kind of commitment  demanded by an organization such as ours.  We are constantly suffering from "burnout" as the demand of the work pulls us  further and further away from seeing our  own needs satisfied. The nature of our  community is such that people do not make  long-term commitments to stay here. People,  leave, seeking greater stimulus in larger  centres. I sense that this problem is  one which will be eternal; that we shall  never have enough women to handle even the  most immediate and demanding tasks; that  we shall always be too few.  The solution is not easy to see; but I believe that it rests in part in our cohesion  as a group — that, even if we are few in  number, the stronger we become the more  we will be able to offer each other the  support we need individually and collectively to continue this work.  Northwest Women in Crisis is perhaps most  fortunate in having been drawn so readily  into the Coalition of B.C. Rape Centres in  April, 1978. The Coalition has provided  us with a connection to the women's movement, through which we are able to gain  access to information and ideas, to participation in a group process on which we  can model our own group mechanics and  gain access to the support of sisters who  are willing to work on solutions to our  problems with us. We are overwhelmed with  the concern shown by the Nanaimo, Victoria  and Vancouver centres that our needs as a  northern isolated centre are met.  Terrace is a community with a population  of 10,000 people and 4,000 people in the  outlying areas. It is located on the  Yellowhead 16 Highway, 90 miles east of  Prince Rupert and 395 miles west of Prince  George. Terrace has been supported by a  single primary industry: logging. The community has changed significantly over the  last few years as the logging operations  which feed the mills in Terrace are going  further into the less populated areas  (due to the overlogging of forest regions  close to Terrace) and as there has been  a suddent centralization of northern government offices in Terrace.  The effect is that Terrace is becoming a  service centre for the north, and more  people employed by the logging industry  are moving out to remote camps; thus  changing the economic nature of the community from a boom-recession economy to a  more stable inert service economy. The  population of Terrace, too, has changed '  and, while transience is still a major  problem, fewer people are attracted to this  community for economic reasons.  Fifteen per cent of the population of the  northwest region is composed of native  people of varied tribal groups. Many of  the native people living in Terrace have  had their rights taken away through the  inequities of the Indian Act. The status  native tribal councils have been fighting  long and hard to gain recognition of their  aboriginal rights to the land and that  battle will continue until the governments  settle land claims with the people. Native  women in the north who have traditionally  been deeply involved in tribal government  are organizing to articulate their needs  and to work towards change.  While Terrace is at the intersection of  the transportation routes in the northwest (road, rail and air) it is still a  very isolated community, as are all northern towns. We are isolated from the major  centre of Vancouver, having little access  to the stimulus which city life offers.  We are isolated from other northern communities by distance and often weather  conditions which make travel in the region  impossible. And, most of all, we in Terrace are isolated from each other, in that  small communities hold little opportunity  for people to develop friendships and form  support relationships with each other.  The meeting places of towns like Terrace  are the taverns.  Those of us who have chosen to live in or  near communities such as the one we have  just described do so because the north  offers a unique opportunity. Here we are  able to experience a lifestyle which demands a strong connection with the environment, and yet which gives a reward of  being continually in contact with and being  nurtured by the quiet and beauty of the  mountains.  We are very appreciative of the desire of  the BCFW Subcommittee on Violence Against  Women to express their support of northern  women through this benefit. It is important that the women's movement be aware of  and responsive to the needs of women who  work and live under conditions which do  not necessarily reflect those of the majority; We hope that this article and the  benefit will draw women across the province closer together to permit greater  understanding and communication and ultimately the realization of our common  goals. 0. ►  IWD  Press Gang  It is important that the women *s movement be aware  of and responsive to the needs of women who work and  live under conditions which do not necessarily reflect  those of the majority B.C. NEWS  Prince Rupert Options for Women is the  other northern group which the lower mainland BCFW benefit will support May 11. Here  they explain their ongoing struggle to set  up a transition house in their area.  By Susan Tickson for Prince Rupert Options  for Women  Many members of the Prince Rupert Options  for Women (PROW) attended a regional Family  Violence Conference held in Terrace approximately three years ago.  This conference initiated our interest in  the general topic of family violence in  the British Columbia northwest and the  need for public awareness and education  regarding this serious social problem.  Shortly after the conference we were contacted by Isobel McKee. She asked us to  help her sister, Maud Rawson. Maud had  been severely beaten by her husband and  had suffered brain damage and permanent  paralysis of her legs. Although Isobel  had made repeated visits to the RCMP, the  Attorney-General's department and to many  lawyers on Maud's behalf, charges were not  laid until nine months later (in the spring  of 1978).  That was shortly after Rosemary  Brown had brought the matter up in the  provincial legislature.  PROW acted in an advocacy and support role  for Maud (setting up a Trust Fund for her),  and supported her through a very difficult  trial which resulted in Fred Rawson being  found guilty and sentenced to an 18 month  jail term.  Maud Rawson's case focused our concern  Maud's case focused our concern on the  needs of battered women in Prince Rupert.  We applied for and received a Secretary of  State grant in 1978. With the grant, we  hired a university student, Barbara Fields,  to do a study to determine whether or not  a serious problem does exist in Prince  Rupert, and if so, how the needs of battered women could be best met.  Ms. Fields met with representatives of all  government social agencies, churches and  religious groups and many concerned individuals in the city. She ran into serious  difficulty gathering official statistics.  The coding and filing systems of the  various agencies did not discriminate between types of assault or causes as to why  individuals were using the services provided. As well, due to policies of confidentiality, all files were not open to public  perusal.  For these reasons the majority of statistics obtained are professional opinions.  The following are some statistics on the  incidence of battering in Prince Rupert:  DOMESTIC DISPUTE ESTIMATES  RCMP — estimate of one domestic dispute  a day  — 436 attended cases of family violence in 1979  Probation Services - Aug. '77-June '78: 25  Emergency Ward: 4 per month.  In addition,  Obstetrics receives 10 per year  Social Workers: A - 4 per week  B - 6 per week  C -12 per year  D - 1 in 8 months  E - 6 per year  As a result of her study, Fields recommended that a Transition House be established  in Prince Rupert as the first of nineteen  recommendations focused on the needs of  women in violent home situations.  As a result of recommendations of the brief,  PROW made a commitment to work toward  establishment of a Transition House in  Prince Rupert. We contacted similar situations and facilities already established  throughout the province, and formulated a  model of an optimum facility.  When funded, we proposed to establish a  house to be run on a cooperative basis by  the occupants themselves, in order to  foster a home-like but responsible, independent atmosphere. The affairs of the  house would be governed by.a Board of Directors elected from the annual meeting of  the members of the Prince Rupert Transition House Society.  As a group, we expressed our concern to  the community at large and asked for responses. We received letters from all  sectors of the community and gathered close  to five hundred names on a petition. We  presented our proposal to Prince Rupert  City Council and received their wholehearted support.  During this time it became clear to us  that there are no adequate facilities for  women in crisis in Prince Rupert. After  consultation with the local RCMP the group  decided to operate emergency shelters on  a volunteer basis.  It was hoped that  these shelters would at least alleviate the  most severe cases. In the year we operated the system we received an average of  one call a week. We were forced to close  down the Emergency Shelter System in the  fall of 1979 after one year of operation  because many volunteers were experiencing  ;'burn out" due to the heavy emotional  stress involved.  We feel we must clearly define the difference between the need met by our emergency  shelter system and a Transition House.  Our emergency shelter system, like the  policy of Ministry of Human Resources (MHR)  of placing families in hotel rooms, was  only designed to remove a woman and her  children from a violent and dangerous situation. We were unable to address ourselves to the real needs of the woman and  her family. We were not even able to support or sustain her through the accompanying trauma. All we were able to do was  remove the woman, and her children, from  the violence, and then, the next day,  force them to return to the same continuing  situation.  A Transition House on the other hand, is  designed to give much more adequate help.  A woman and her children are permitted to  remain within the sanctuary of the house  until they have learned to deal with the  trauma of their situation and address  themselves to their own real needs —. such  as marital counselling, job skills counselling, budgeting, in fact, the entire  range of services available — in order to  resolve the conflict within the relationship, or, if necessary, to establish an  independent life.  After completing a proposal for funding,  PROW submitted it to the local MHR office.  The proposal was endorsed and supported,  and sent to the regional office in Terrace.  At this stage, the proposal was rejected.  The reason stated was that there is a  "relatively low number of women requiring  emergency shelter".  We feel that the statistics we have gathered dispute this statement. One call regarding a serious domestic dispute a day  taken by the RCMP indicates a problem of  very significant proportions.  The rejection of this proposal by the regional MHR office directed us back to the  community to reassess the need. We had  further discussions with local social  workers and agency representatives who  reaffirmed their support for our position.  As well, we reported back to City Council  who immediately have the transition house  top priority status and requested reappraisal by the regional and provincial  ministry levels. After struggling through  a lot of red tape we were able to set up  a meeting with Grace McCarthy in the fall  of 1979. The minister assured us that she  considered the problem significant, however  she was not sure a Transition House would  be the solution. She promised us that she  and ministry officials would review the  situation and respond once again to our  proposal.  In February we received the ministry's  response. They have formulated a policy  designed to answer all requests for transition houses from small rural communities.  The policy is an attempt to use a volunteer community group to administer a system  of placing battered women and their children in hotels for a maximum stay of five  nights.  In addition to paying hotel and  meal costs, the ministry will pay the  volunteer group $5.00 a head for administering the policy.  We have rejected this policy. It seems  designed to solve the troublesome "problem" of repeated requests for funding from  smaller communities rather than the very  real needs of battered women.  Most recently PROW sponsored a public  meeting which initiated the formation of  the Prince Rupert Transition House Society.  Many members of PROW have been elected to  the Board of Directors of this society.  We have made a strong commitment to working  towards establishing a Transition House in  Prince Rupert. Since becoming fully  aware of the problem, we have tried very  hard to document the need of battered  women, and give piecemeal aid to victims  of family violence. Our intention is to  continue to work towards establishing a  safe refuge for women and their children  who experience family violence.

Developing feminist services north of Nanaimo  KINESIS: Can you explain, first of all,  what your project is?  DENISE: It's called the Women's Services  Training Program. It is a one-year pilot  project sponsored by the Secretary of State  Women's Program. There are 10 similar  projects in Canada, not divided by provinces. We are the only region where there  is hardly any feminist services. Besides  our project on Vancouver Island there is  one in the Kootenays, in Alberta, Regina,  Thunder Bay, London, Newfoundland, New  Brunswick, and two in Quebec.  KINESIS: What exactly do you do?  DENISE: The national mandate was to basically add an extra staff person to existing women's services in communities —  legitimize the need for more women's services, to show how they're vital. Women's  services generally meaning things like  transition houses, rape relief centres,  women's centres etc. Our project was the  only one where we had virtually no existing  women's services.  North of Nanaimo there are no women * s services so what we did was negotiate with  some agencies to have a worker placed with  them, but because they were in traditional  agencies we formed a collective to be the  base from which the worker operated out of  as opposed to other projects in Canada  where the women were already in a women's  service which had a feminist direction.  One of our workers in Campbell River was  placed in the John Howard Society and was  working with men so really needed support.  That was one of the main reasons our collective became really tight because we  needed that support and our job mandate  was developed by the workers as a group.  The worker who was working with existing  women's services - our Nanaimo worker, for  example, put a lot of energy into working  with Rape Relief and Haven, which is a  society for battered women.  KINESIS: So what did the. women do once  they were in  the various groups?  DENISE: Basically, in terms of jargon, we  added to the delivery of the services to  women. In fact what happened in Courtenay  and Campbell River was a worker ended up  doing a lot of outreach. In Courtenay -we  counselled battered women. In Courtenay,  Campbell River, and Port Hardy, where we  have a volunteer worker, and in Port  Alberni, where we have a Native woman working at the Friendship Centre, the worker  became the person who the women in the  community funnelled their requests to.  Somebody in the community who specifically  was there to respond to women's needs.  The workers were totally.overwhelmed-for  the first four months with requests for  counselling, and battered women saying  what do I do, where do I go? And we  realized that we could not use all the workers ' time on this immediate crisis intervention and that we had to develop some  long range strategy, to do something more  effective.  We got into outreach work and needs assessment so as to develop further programs.  That's basically what happened in Courtenay,  Campbell River and Port Alberni. In Port  Hardy the worker helped start a women's  centre which is now funded through the  Secretary of State. In Port Alberni a very  dynamic group of women have been working  on trying to set up some alternative resources for battered women. They again  got funded through Secretary of State.  KINESIS: What were some of the programs or  outreach work you set up?  DENISE: Both in Courtenay and Campbell  River we brought in women to do workshops,  like self defence and rape relief forums.  We did a women's film series, and public  education workshops. We have a Violence .  and Women Information Workshop which will  be travelling throughout the whole island,  into eight communities.  KINESIS: Con you tell us a bit more about  that?  DENISE: Jude Angione is our worker in  Victoria and works for Women Against Violence Against Women Subcommittee which is  basically SWAG, Rape Relief and Transition  House in Victoria — she has designed this  travelling workshop and produced a video  for it. With it also goes an information  package and a pamphlet of resources for  women on Vancouver Island. We spend a  day in a community showing the video and  doing a public education workshop on  Violence Against Women.  KINESIS: What else has your project init-  ated or been involved with?  DENISE: There's the volunteer buddy counselling network in Courtenay. Our funding  runs out on March 31st and we're basically  burnt out so we're not going to continue  that but we've developed a very elaborate  proposal for a women's self-help and advocacy network on the whole north island.  We're going to Health and Welfare Canada  for that money.  We're hoping to use the experience of this  year to develop a model for basically a  three year community development scheme  Any other feminists in Quesnel?  I moved to Quesnel in late 1979 to work in  the community law centre, and I have grown  desperate for feminist companionship. Is  there any way I can get in touch with such  women in my area for the sharing of ideas,  books, support, etc.? (No, the object is  not matrimony!) I know there are lots of  fine, strong women out there. I just have  not managed to locate them. Jillian Smith,  18 - 612 Elm Street, Quesnel B.C.  Daycare comes to the Yukon  After years of lobbying by the Yukon Status  of Women Council and the Yukon Child Care  Association, the Yukon Conservative government has introduced the Day Care  Ordinance, Bill 15.  This ordinance comes into effect this May.  Its purpose is to create a Board and establish a licensing system for facilities  providing day care services for children  under the age of six years.  The Yukon Status of Women Council points  out that Bill 15 talks about day care, not  childcare. Twenty-four hour childcare  is essential for women to have equal access  to employment opportunities," the Council  stresses.  Furthermore, the Bill makes no allowances  for funding for the centres themselves.  "Bill 15 will make childcare available for  those who can afford it, not those who need  it," the Council adds. "This ordinance  places most of its emphasis on the mechanics of the Board, not the welfare of  children." 0. Optimist  Prince George daycare study  excludes WERA women  Prince George City Council has formed a  Task Force on Day Care. Although members  of the Women's Equal Rights Association  (WERA) has expressed interest in representation on the Task Force, no WERA members were appointed. Nor was any woman  with children of childcare age appointed.  NAC  for rural women. From our experience in  the last year where we did community organizing workshops and skills workshops,  we saw from the impact it had in Courtenay,  Campbell River and Port Alberni that it  could possibly be developed into a more  sophisticated model where we could go into rural communities. We could train  people and provide them with skills to  help them develop alternative resources  in their own community — providing them  with information on funding, how to work  within the system, how to develop alternative resources — it could be a mini-bus  service or a mother and tot drop-in, more  recreation facilities or a women's centre  or a transition house. So that's the  scheme we're working on.  We see the logical consequence to the work  we've done that if any more outreach work  is going to be done in this area we should  be getting into more preventative strategies, rather than concentrating on this  crisis intervention which is so band-aid  and so ineffectual, in communities where  there are no resources for women to turn  to and no support systems.  We have to help women to develop their  support systems and do some sort of preventative work so that they might not  reach that crisis situation.  KINESIS: What are some of the differences  between a project like this in a city and  the same project happening in a rural area',  DENISE: We certainly downplay the word  'feminist'. The farther north on the Island you go and the more single industry  resource towns there are (which are basically male-dominated and created for men)  there's a real fear of feminism and  'women's lib' as it's called. In Port  Hardy it's been very hard to even get the  women's resource centre going because  there's a lot of very threatened men in  these towns.  You have to work very delicately  You have to work very delicately and the  issues which women find important are not  issues women in cities might find important. IvSaybe they want more take-a-break  sessions at the local skating rink, with  childcare. The thing is childcare facilities are not good in any of these communities so that's really a major need.  KINESIS: Who are the women working on the  project?  DENISE: There are eight women who come to  our collective meeting. Meetings are once  a month and they rotate from community to  community. Jude Angione works in Victoria  Annabel Cammeron works in Nanaimo for  Haven and Rape Relief, Lee Jessiman works  in Courtenay for Mental Health and the  Ministry of Human Resources, Jean Kotcher  works in Campbell River at the John Howard  Society, Judy Joseph works in Port Alberni  at the Friendship Centre, Carla Stein is a  volunteer working in Port Hardy with the  women's centre, and Sandy Kennedy and myself work out of the Courtenay office.  We have had what we called a small 'c'  collective which was the women from the  north island who met twice a month and  worked much more tightly and from our work  came the Women's self-help and Advocacy  proposal. We had a lot of problems with  the structure of the program as it was set  up by the Canada Employment and Immigration Centres (CEIC).  KINESIS: I thought the project was funded  by the Secretary of State ?  DENISE: No. This program was funded by  CEIC Youth Corp but is sponsored by the  Secretary of State Women's Program —  they asked CEIC for the money. On Vancouver Island we got the age limit lifted  because we said we wanted to reintegrate  women into the workforce.  Q ACROSS CANADA  Appraising Feminist Visions of  the Future  By Jan Lancaster  The National Action Committee on the Status  of Women (NAC), is a Toronto-based, voluntary feminist organization comprised of  more than 140 affiliated women's groups  across Canada.  Its principle aim is to improve the position of Canadian women. NAC developed out  of the Committee for the Equality of Women  in Canada, which was instrumental in having  the Royal Commission on the Status of  Women established in .1968.  Since its founding NAC has grown steadily,  both in numbers and in the range of issues  covered. "The most powerful lobby for  women in Canada," NAC formulates policy  positions and presents briefs to the government. It takes women's concerns to the  public through special forums and the Status of Women News magazine. It also promotes the building of a national network  of women's, organizations.  Vancouver Status of Women has been a member  of NAC for several years. I was the delegate from VSW to this year's annual weekend  long conference of NAC, which was entitled  Feminist Visions of the Future: The Family.  There were two keynote speakers. Rosemary  Brown, NDP MLA from B.C> was extremely  well-received, and gave a& overview of the  practically non-existent rfuclear family.  Mary O'Brien, Professor at the Ontario  Institute for Studies in Education took as  her topic, "The Personal is Political".  She was excellent, amusing and informative.  There were three workshops on Saturday  morning covering the following topics:  Reconceptions of Reproduction: Bearing and  Raising Children, Women's Control of their  Bodies, Societal Supports, Alternative  Life Styles and Changing Sex Roles: androgyny, sexual stereotypes, sexual orientation; Perspectives on Domestic Labour:  economic approaches to the values of  women's work, exploitation of domestics,  "wages for housework".  These were followed in the afternoon by:  Economic Penalties of Parenting: unemployment insurance, pensions, occupational  health and safety, sexual harassment, job  retraining and counselling; Creative Marital Breakdown: divorce, property, support,  provincial responsibility, violence in the  family, societal supports; and finally,  Women and Aging: pensions, health care and  support services.  My major criticisms of the NAC conference  stem from the above mentioned workshops —  they were too broad in scope.  There was an insufficient number of workshops, which meant that there were at  least 100 women in each workshop — far  too many for discussion and decent, well-  developed resolutions for presentation to  plenary.  I felt let down. I didn't work hard enough,  it was all too pleasant and low key. I  experienced a sense of deja vu, I have been  through all this before ~ years ago, in  BCFW. I was left wondering, why are these  people still discussing it?  While the title of the conference referred  to feminist visions, we were still passing  resolutions on subjects of the mid-  seventies : affirmative action^ for example  (it doesn't work).  In terms of human rights, resolutions  supporting the elimination of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation  were passed. On Monday, NAC presented  them personally to the Human Rights Commission.  Three strong resolutions were passed concerning Indian rights for Indian women.  As a group, the Indian women were the most  political and the most prepared. Subsequently they were able to get some positive  resolutions passed.  There is no doubt, and the amount of media  coverage the conference received confirms  this, that NAC is the strongest feminist  lobby. But the B.C. women's movement was  noticeably absent — only four B.C. groups  were present.  Why? It's a well-worn topic by now, I  know. But it is one, I feel, which should  be reviewed periodically. Should we become  involved and make our presence felt at  next year's conference? Is political  lobbying at the federal level still valid  and important? What, if anything, can we  achieve through NAC? Would the time and  energy be worth it?  Let's discuss it again.  0_  This year, persons head up  household hierarchies  Statistics Canada has changed its "head of  household" designations for the census  conducted every five years. The change is  a result of charges of sexism by feminists  during the 1971 and 1976 censuses, where  men were automatically assumed to be the  "head of the household".  Now Canadians will be asked to choose  "Person 1" in their home. That person will  be asked to answer questions about her or  his relationship to the other residents in  the home, who will become "Person 2",  "Person 3" etc.  Well, that change only took us ten years.  On to the next... Q  Vancouver Sun info.  should be judged according to what the community will tolerate, morality and decency  should be judged according to "contemporary  Canadian community standards", a stricter  definition.  Toronto Clarion  Domestics intercede for their  rights  INTERCEDE, (international Coalition to End  Domestics' Exploitation) is lobbying in  the Ontario legislature to improve the  working conditions of domestic workers.  Composed of a coalition of women from  Employment Services for Immigrant Women,  Housewives' Initiative and the Wages for  Housework Committee, Intercede says that it  is fighting to ensure that a bill bringing  domestic work under minimum wage legislation will be passed when introduced in the  Ontario legislature this year. Q  Body Politic acquittal overturned; new trial ordered  Body Politic's publishers, Pink Triangle  Press, have had their earlier acquittal  overturned and a new trial ordered. Charges were originally laid because of an  article on sexual relations bewteen men  and boys in the December 1977 issue of the  Body Politic. Last fall Judge Sydney  Harris acquiited them on charges of using  the mails to transmit "indecent, immoral  and scurrilous" material.

Ferguson's new  ruling says that while obscene material  Winnipeg unable to host bi-  national lesbian conference  At last year's Bi-National Lesbian Conference it was proposed that Winnipeg hold the  1980 conference. A collective of Winnipeg  women officially accepted this offer in  September. Unfortunately, we feel that at  this point, we are unable to fulfill our  committment.  During our organizational meetings it became apparent that the majority of the  collective felt we had neither the woman  power nor the financial resources to hold  a conference in 1980. We now feel that  our energies would best be spent in local  and regional organizing so that we will  have the resources to hold a conference in  the future.  We are sending this letter to as many  women's groups in Canada as possible.  Hopefully there will be enough time for  another city to organize a conference this  year.  We would like to thank all of the women,  especially those in Saskatoon, who had  supported our efforts to organize the conference .  We apologize for having taken this long in  reaching our decision. And we sincerely  hope that another group will be able to  hold the 1980 conference.  Lesbian Conference  Planning Committee  Winnipeg  (J)$  Women fight for jobs at  aircraft plant  A defense committee has been formed to defend the right of three women, Suzanne  Chabot, Katy LeRougetel and Wendy Stevenson, to jobs at the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft plant in Longueuil, Quebec. These  three women were "laid off" from the plant  on November 16, 1979, several days before  the end of their probationary period.  These "layoffs due to a personnel surplus"  occured at the same time as the company is  undergoing an unprecedented expansion.  More than 800 new workers have been hired  over the past period. In information  sessions for new employees the management  of Pratt and Whitney even affirmed that  they project hiring another several hundred workers in the months to come and  that, with the contracts already signed or  foreseen by the company, these jobs are  stable until at least 1984-85.  Women constitute a very small proportion  of the work force in the Pratt and Whitney  plants. Moreover, women are relegated to  the work seen as "light" or "delicate" —  in other words, the least interesting and  the least well-paid jobs. Almost no women  work on the assembly line or as machinists,  operators or inspectors in the machine  shop, etc., even if they have the required  qualifications.  The company admitted to these three workers that their work reports were excellent.  When the women raised the fact that there  was massive hiring in departments other  than their own, management, replied that women couldn't fill these positions because  they were "men's jobs."  Local 510 of the United Workers (UAW) has  submitted a brief to the Quebec Human  Rights Commission charging the company with  political discrimination against these  three women. This brief has been endorsed  by the Quebec Human Rights League. Q Kinesis April SO  INTERNATIONAL  France goes pro-natalist. But  why?  FRANCE—The French government, concerned  over a steady decline in the country's  population, recently announced measures to  encourage production of larger families.  Among the proposed programs are a government grant of $2500 for the birth of the  third and each succeeding child, and an  increase in existing family allotments,  either directly or through tax relief, at  the rate of 3%  per year for families with  three or more children. This is more than  double the amount granted to smaller families.  If the proposals are adopted, maternity  leave for working mothers will be increased  to six months from four for the third and  succeeding children, and all mothers of  three or more children will be eligible  for government pensions covering the  years spent raising their families.  Finally, families having three or more  children will be eligible to move to larger  quarters in government-supported housing  during the first six months after the  child's birth. If they choose to buy or  build a house, they can apply for a grant  of up to 100$ of the downpayment.  These proposals generated little enthusiasm in the French National Assembly.  According to one delegate, "This is nothing but a cynical attempt to appease the  anti-abortion forces in government on  the eve of the upcoming abortion debate."  (The debate over whether to renew, reject,  or revamp the abortion laws.)  If abortions remain accessible or become  more accessible, the new pro-baby proposals may represent real progress in  social valuation of childbearing and  childrearing. However, the governments  of France, Germany and the Scandinavian  countries, among others, are motivated  more by distress over population decline,  falling tax base, and shrinking workforce  than by concern over justice for women.  These new proposals, if coupled with  greater restrictions on abortion, will  constitute a great step backward in the  struggle against biological determinism. 0      00B  UN women's conference coming  up in Copenhagen  On July 14-30, 1980, the United Nations  World Conference on the Decade of Women  will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Representatives of governments, specialized  agencies and organizations of the United  Nations and inter-governmental organizations will assess the progress made and the  obstacles encountered in carrying out the  World Plan of Actiop adopted at the International Women's Year Conference held in  Mexico in 1975.  The agenda calls for a discussion of a  specific action-oriented program for women,  with special emphasis on the areas of employment, health, and education. Delegates  will also examine and make recommendations  on the conditions of women in South Africa,  the question of Palistinian women and the  situation of women refugees the world over.

The rapist,  Francesco Poddi, a policeman, father of  two small children, and a "loving husband"  as family and friends described him, is,  accused of having raped Annalia on January  28, 1977.  Three years were needed to finally try the  case and to reach a verdict (you guessed  it!!) of innocent.

Her  record-breaking time of four minutes  eight seconds had the Madison Square Gardens crowd in a frenzy.  Decker's speed was remarkable because  sports record-keepers have assumed that  women runners will never be able to make  the legendary 4-minute mile. By running  1500 meters (slightly under a mile), around a difficult track with numerous tight  bends, Decker proved that women will soon  begin to match men's track records.

VanDenberg of the University of California  at Berkeley.  The researchers studied more than 8,000  pregnant women who received the same basic  care during pregnancy. They found that  among women who did not want to be pregnant  but didn't have abortions, there was a  significantly higher -risk to the fetus and  the newborn child.  The researchers said that for women with  negative attitudes about pregnancy, the  death rate of fetuses was about 60 per  1,000 pregnancies. The death rate for newborns of women who resented their pregnancies was about 28 per 1,000.  For women who were happy about their pregnancies, however, the death rate of newborns was only 11 per 1,000 births.

Q  Bay Area women's building is  now one year old  The Bay Area Women's Building is one year  old this May. Formerly, this four-storey  stucco building was a little-used men's  lodge hall. It took two years of intensive  fund-raising by hundreds of women to buy  and open the building.  San Francisco Women's Centres, an umbrella  organization representing 30 women's groups  bought the building. Rental income covers  only half of the monthly expenses, so the  rest has to come from grants, donations  and benefits.  Fifteen different women's groups are now  permanently housed in the building.  The building also has a women's library,  an excellent, up-to-date referral switchboard, and a drop-in room with job and  housing listings.

Stevens boycott  She says she ended her self-imposed retirement from the labour spotlight several  months ago as a result- of what she says  was an inaccurate media portrayal of her  efforts to gain rights for textile workers  at J.P. Stevens plants in North Carolina.  Sutton was blacklisted from holding mill  jobs in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina,  after being fired from J.P. Stevens in  1973 for her union organizing activities.  She said that five years after her activities won Stevens the right to union representation, J.P. Stevens has still not  signed a contract with its workers. Stevens has been cited in 18 separate National Labour Relations Board decisions for  unfair labour practices since 1963 and  fined over $1.5 million. Sutton reasons,  however that with 1978 assets of $995  million it's cheaper for Stevens to break  the law than to comply with a contract for  its workers.  Sutton says that although Twentieth Century Fox made Norma Rae  against her wishes  it is one of the best union movies ever  made. She adds that for the film to have  had more meaning for the labour movement,  it should have showed the fact that the  union is still trying to get a contract  with J.P. Stevens. She adds that the  movie also neglected to show the effects  of brown lung disease among J.P. Stevens  workers exposed to cotton dust in the  textile mills.  Sutton says today in J.P. Stevens mills  "People lose their jobs, work long hours  and don't even get a lunch break. They  get hurt on the job, lose an arm or a  leg for life and then the company's  through with them." She said, for example  her aunt worked in a mill for 49 years  and received retirement benefits of only  $3,000, amounting to a $27 a month check.  Says Sutton, "So many people think this is.  something out of the 1930s, but this is  happening in the South today."  Sutton, by the way, hasn't received so  much as a cent from the book based on her  work, and the film adapted from it. Negotiations are in the works for her to  receive $25,000 from Twentieth Century Fox.  She is currently working on a sequel to  Norma Rae  with Barbara Kopple, whose documentary "Harlan County U.S.A." was magnificent.  9      New Woman Tvmes  Her Say  The cervical cap—could it be an alternative?  There?s good news and bad news about the  cervical cap, a birth control method that  the U.S. National Women's Health Network  has been encouraging for the last several  years. The cap is a cup-like rubber device, similar to but much smaller than the  diaphragm, that fits over the cervix. Its  advocates say it is easier to use than the  diaphragm, does not become dislodged  during sex, can remain inside longer, is  much safer than the pill or IUD, and quite  cheap. More than 100 women's health  centres reportedly prescribe the cap, which  they import from England and other European countries, since its manufacture in  the US stopped with the advent of the pill.  The bad news, according to cap advocators,  is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has decided to reclassify the device,  making it illegal to use as a contraceptive. The good news is that the FDA will  no longer confiscate cap shipments from  Britain and the Centre for Population  Research will make funds available to test  the cap's effectiveness, which means that  clinics can continue to prescribe the cap  if they apply for federal funds to test  the cap's effectiveness.  In Canada, Women Healthsharing, a Toronto  feminist group, is trying to find out more  about cervical caps in this country. Anyone who has fitted caps, been fitted for a  cap or unsuccessfully tried to obtain a  cap is invited to write to Madeline Boscoe  and Connie Clement, c/o Women Healthsharing  Box 230, Station "M", Toronto, Ontario  M6S 4T3. £  Off Our Backs  Our person who art non-sexist  The British Council of Churches is now  urging its flock to address their prayers  to "parent god" rather than "our father.."  In a book of prayers and hymns just published by the council, there are prayers  for sexual equality:  * Give us a vision of equality which transcends that of human lawmakers  * Free us from prejudices about the roles  of the sexes. n FNS CHILDREN AND THE LAW  Shades of "The Scarlet Letter"  How the law preserves archaic stigma of illegitimacy  By Monica Loewi  I am an unwed mother. Fifteen or twenty  years ago, that confession would have  caused me to suffer embarassment and  shame. Today, my foremost emotion is anger. I feel rage and resentment born from  the frustration of being held solely responsible for a circumstance which I did  not create alone. I feel outrage because  my innocent child must experience consequences of this circumstance.  I was under the impression that laws and  social mores had eliminated the stigma  of illegitimacy. My experience has  proved that the former, particularly,  discriminates still against children (and  their female parents) who are the issue of  unions not legitimized by the institution  of marriage. Legally, our rights have  been indelibly stamped by the Scarlet  Letter.  My son was born in 1972. I didn't attempt  to seek support for him until the end of  1978. My ignorance of the law caused me to  forfeit his legal right to support from his  father.  In retrospect, I believe I had very valid  reasons for delaying so long: I had a  difficult labour ending in a Cesarean  Section with complications; my son was an  extremely active baby and young child; I  was concerned exclusively with finding  ways for us to subsist on minimum funds;  I had been contacted several times by the  father of my child — enough to stimulate  some hope of future support; I was afraid  that, if I took legal steps, his father  would deny paternity and, worse, that he  would harm us in some way.  It wasn't until my child was older and  more settled and I had regained some energy  and courage; I had a steady (if not very  lucrative) job; I was reinforced by the  growing feminist climate; and I heard of  a new genetic tissue-typing test of pater-  • nity (Histo Compatibility Locus) which was  deemed to be 99$ effective that I mustered  enough strength and confidence to fight.  I was also fortunate (not having enough  funds to go into combat with a man of  power and means) in obtaining some help  from an old friend who is a lawyer and  was willing to take the case on a contingency basis.  1979 was called the Year of the Child.  I  thought this was an appropriate time for  me to invest my energies in the pursuit  of rights for my child. During my investigations I became aware that, to a large ,  extent, the impressive title was another  example of public relations hype. The  "child" made a poignant subject for stories, photographs and good intentions but  was rarely a considered individual when  rights were vested.  If I refused or were unable to look after  my child, he would receive assistance  (financial and/or legal) from the government; since I choose to care for him myself, his rights are limited by the law.  The laws (as my lawyer helpfully  reminded me) are made by men, for men  The laws in British Columbia (and indeed  in most places) do not recognize my reasons  for postponing action as sound. The laws  (as my lawyer helpfully reminded me) are  "made by men for men." We have two acts  which could cover maintenance and support  of a child born out of wedlock. The first  is the Children of Unmarried Parents Act.  Under this Act there is a time limitation  for making a complaint of one year after  the birth of the child; or within one year  after any act on the part of the father  (such as giving money for the sole purpose  of supporting the child or declaring his  paternity in writing) which shows that he  acknowledges he is the father; or within  one year after the father returns to the  province if he has been absent ("Don't  hold your breath!" )  After the expiration of the period of  limitation, the child is no longer protected by this Act; but the "punative" father  is protected — he is no longer considered  responsible for the existence of the child.  The second law which could govern a plea  for support for a child of unmarried parents is the new Family Relations Act. It  seemed to recognize that the child has the  right to the support of both parents,  whether or not they were legitimized by  marriage. It states that, "Each parent of  a child is responsible and liable for the  reasonable and necessary support and maintenance of the child..." (Part 4, Maintenance and Support Obligations)  On further scrutiny, however, I discovered  that the Act contains a definition of "parent" which includes "the father of the  child, where the father and mother are not  married to each other" only when he "contributes to the support and maintenance of  a child for not less than 1 year". (Part I,  Interpretation and Jurisdiction)  It has been pointed out to me that the  preceding interpretation keeps such a  father from later asserting rights of custody because he has never provided support.  I would suggest that this eventuality could  be taken carenof as an interpretation under  the Part called "Child Custody, Access and  Guardianship" (Part 2) and need not be a  blanket definition for the entire Act. As  it stands I read the Act as saying that  the mother of the child (unless she chooses  to give up the child for adoption), because  she gives birth to the child and is "guardian of the person" of her child, must take  the sole responsibility for having conceived and created the child.  and which waives limitations of time to  seek such support until the child has  reached the age of majority. The State of  California has an act called the Uniform  Parentage Act. It states that, "The  parent and child relationship extends  equally to every child and to every parent  regardless of the marital status of the  parents." (Section 7002). Unfortunately,  for me (and I am sure for most single  mothers), it is impossible to find the  means to move to California to establish  residency and secure my child's rights.  I had an extended (ten years) relationship  with the father of my child. That fact  had comforted me and reinforced my conviction that I should seek financial help for  the support of our son. When I re-examine  the situation objectively, however, I  realize that the interests of the child  are of paramount consideration and that  the length of relationship between parents  should not be an issue.  Why is there still a double standard?  The law protecting children who are a result of married unions states that they  must be cared for to the best of the abilities of each of the parents.  Why is there still a double standard for  children who are born out of wedlock?  Why is the father of a child not considered  equally responsible for some of the burden  of support if he is not married to the '  mother?  It is mandatory that we look more closely  at our laws and ensure that the rights of  children (and consequently women) are uniformly protected.  I have told the-story of my attempts to  gain support for my child to several  The same Act puts no such limitations on  the rights to support and maintenance of  a child with married parents. In that  case the father, even if he does not support the child for the one year minimum,  is legally responsible for the sharing of  protecting the welfare of his child. Further, the Act does not prohibit a father  who is the "guardian of the person" of his  child from seeking legal action for support from the mother even if she has not  supported the child for a minimum of one.  year.  I did find one place which seems to consider that a child has the right to support from both parents, married or not,  Sylvie Beauregard  people: lawyers, friends, and acquaintances  and the'Minister of Human Resources. Although I have received a measure of sympathy and understanding, I have not yet  found a person or people who are able to  assist in making changes to our laws.  It is important for me to contact those  who are concerned with the inequities of  our present laws dealing with child support and maintenance and who are determined  to effect modifications.

WAN,  MM  "**V  :■%/**.  Signs translate as "the struggle continues." In memory of Nashter Dhahan  By Kinesis staff writers  Our bodies, ourselves. That was the theme  for Vancouver celebrations of International Women's Day, March 8.  Why March 8? In 1908, working women in  New York marched under banners demanding  equal pay, childcare, the right to vote  and an end to sweatshop conditions. Since  that time, women all over the world have  used March 8 to have their voices heard.  This year in Vancouver, we vocalized our  demands for control by women of our bodies,  ourselves and our world.  In a march and rally, and in a day of outreach in local libraries and shopping malls,  we called for:  * the right to birth control and abortion  * the right to freedom from all forms of  violence, including sexual harassment and  'rape  the right to end male-defined, male-  controlled images of women in all forms  of media  * the right of women to free ourselves  from nuclear technology and manipulation  by the medical industry  The ad hoc International Women's Day committee not only coordinated the day of  outreach, but also produced a broadsheet  detailing the services provided by the  local women's movement. This broadsheet,  along with informational pamphlets from  each of the local women's group, was  handed out in shopping malls, libraries,  and on street corners on outreach day,  March 1.  At the Oakridge Mall, the outreach happily  coincided with a protest organized against  Human Resources Week by the Welfare Action  Coalition.  More than 800 people took part in the march  and rally on March 8 : virtually every women's group in Vancouver was represented,  our numerous banners making a colourful display on the courthouse steps.  In addition to these events, we partied  twice, with an all-women celebration March  8 and a mixed benefit March 1. From these  the IWD committee was able to raise funds  to cover costs.  March 8 committee to continue  The IWD committee has decided to maintain  itself as an on-going group, meeting throughout the year. Next meeting is Wednesday,  April 23, 7.30 p.m. at Britannia Community  Centre, room L5.  The rally following the march was a mixture  of songs and speeches.  Ferron, Carol Street, the Song Spinsters,  and the Euphoniously Feminist Non-performing Quintet Plus One were among groups sharing song and celebration.  Speakers included Kathy Hunt, of the Welfare Action Coalition, and VSW's Debra Lewis.  Hunt spoke of the myths that go around about  people on welfare, and contrasted them with  the reality of being a single mother, trying to make ends meet well below the poverty  line.  Lewis described to the rally how Aid. Gerard has refused to support city funding for  VSW's legal advocate'on the grounds that  we are pro-choice on abortion and sexual  orientation.  Among other speakers was Ulrika Weissger-  ber of SORWUC, who related the theme of  March 8 to the struggle to organize the unorganized, particularly clerical workers.  Danyele Leroux spoke of women's reality  in Quebec, while Yvette Perreault, of the  B.C. Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres gave  an overview of how far we've come and how  far we've yet to go. Kinesis celebrates  March 8 by re-printing excerpts from those  two speeches. ► INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY  Danyele Leroux describes Quebecoise  experience  Danyele Leroux spoke to the rally about  the experience of women in Quebec. "The  church, patriarchy, the capitalist system  and the anglophone corporation have united  in Quebec to create and perpetuate for us,  women, a climate of repression. We are  conditioned to be passive housekeepers,  servants and baby-makers. We suffocate  in extreme authoritarian families where we  are subordinated to male dominance and  power...we struggle constantly for our  rights as francophones, receiving inadequate support from other women all across  Canada...  The referendum  "We are facing a very confusing dilemma in  Quebec right now. The upcoming referendum.  On the one hand, a "no" vote will be seen  as a lack of support in Quebec for independence by corporate and federal government  interests in English Canada and by many  anglophones. Why? Because the referendum  has been seen for so long as representing  the anger of Quebecois people against their  oppression within this country. A defeat  for Quebec, consequently, will be seen as  a victory for federalism, a loss of credibility. A more repressive government and  greater assimilation will come.  "On the other hand, a "yes" vote is also a  problem inside Quebec. It would be interpreted by federalism and all the other  provinces -as a rise of Quebec as a nation,  a strong united force. But within Quebec  i{  would mean a vote for the P.Q. as a  party.  The P.Q. represents more autonomy,  but not real independence. In addition,  the P.Q. was voted in by militants, women,  unionists, working class people. It represented the sentiment, it meant our pride.  It made many promises but hasn't kept them.  It has refused women's rights to abortion,  it has closed rape relief centres and it  doesn't want to finance daycare....  "Whatever Quebecois people decide, English  Canadians must, above all, support our right  to determine our own future. Even if the  referendum fails, the struggle for national rights will continue.  "You should not think that the media, the  corporations, your government, with their  anti-Quebec slogans and petitions are  coming from a place of sorrow and sadness  about the eventuality of loosing Quebec as  a province or a culture. They are only  interested in their own economic investments By putting pressure on us by  denying our language rights, by pulling  out of Quebec with their industries and  their banks, they are doing all they can to  intimidate us.  "Those corporations, media and governments  are the same people who refuse you, the  women of B.C., your abortion rights. They  are the same people who say that lesbians  are sick and perverted.  They are the same  people who tell us that pornography does  not lead to rape...  "If anglophones refuse support to women  and people in Quebec, the anglophone communities will be standing beside the government and corporations that deny our rights  as women, as feminists, as workers and as  union members right across Canada.  "We need you to organize protests, to send  thousands of letters supporting our fight.  We need you to take an active part in  organizing a conference which will deal  with the women's movement in Quebec and  our struggle against national oppression.  We need you to denounce corporation interests, to rally to our cause. We need you  to examine how this bullshit about Quebec,  this national chauvinism, has determined  the values that you have internalized as  being right.  "Quebec has so much to offer as a movement,  emerging and taking responsibility for  itself. It is inspiring to us as women and  as feminists who are also climbing towards  recognition and validation." 0  March 8 pics Gillian Marie  Sue Newman GaylaReid for   just  a   few  of  US  Welfare Action Coalition, addressing March 8 rally  Yvette Perrault, of the B.C. Coalition of  Rape Crisis Centres, also spoke at the  rally.  "We have come together today",  Perrault said, "to affirm our struggle, to  celebrate and applaud our successes:  Applauding our successes  * we have developed an analysis of the oppression of women based on our own experience  * we have learned that the personal is  indeed political  * we have established a number of feminist  organizations and services to help ourselves and each other — transition houses,  rape crisis centres, bookstores, a women's  health collective, women's unions, self-  defence courses, a women's press, women's  films and videos, women's music and art,  women's media, peer counselling groups,  problem-solving groups...  *: for many years we have secured government funding for our projects and services  * there is a general acceptance of lesbians  'as an integral part of the women's movement.  Lesbian resources now exist  * we have created a province-wide network  of feminist organizations. The British  Columbia Federation of Women unites 48  member groups  * the structure and perspective of the BCFW  has been used in the formation of a national  feminist network, the Canadian Association  of Sexual Assault Centres  "We have developed a strong women's community which now offers many alternatives  to an alienating, oppressive culture.  "As the Women's Liberation Movement, we  have protested and acted together on specific objectives that are meant to bring us  closer to our goal of freedom:  * we have fought for and won abortion (sort  of? maybe?)  * we have made changes in rape laws (but  how does that stop rape?)  * we now have women's studies programs in  the schools  * the public is more aware of women's oppression and there is a general acceptance  of the women's liberation movement as credible and positive (is that true, generally?)  * it is now "legal" to be a lesbian (as  long as you're locked away in your own bedroom, as long as you don't want to be a  mother, care for children, kiss another  woman in public and are over 21)  "So we've developed an analysis, built a  community, a culture, learned to talk to  each other, found some points of agreement,  and we are beginning to learn to fight with  each other and not have that destroy us.  And we've made some noise out there...  "But how far has that got us when we look  back at our original goal, to be free?  But how far have we come?  "There are not many new faces here today  — not many,older women, not many young  women, not many women with different colour  skins and not enough women whose language  is other than English.  * our wages are lower than ever when compared with men's salaries and the cost-of-  living increases  * women's groups are still dependent on  government approval and funding  * we are losing our right to abortion and  only quietly protesting  * we still don't have day care for our  children  * we are still bombarded with gross sexist  advertising and pornography is becoming  more violent  * women are virtually being forced to dress  in even more restrictive clothing: tight  slit skirts and spike heels  * the majority of women are still working  in unfulfilling, boring, backbreaking jobs  * Vancouver Status of Women loses its city  funding because they support choice on  abortion and gay rights  #there are more and more women believing  that making personal change is the same as  politically significant work  * Vancouver Rape Relief went through a long  painful process when we realized that, basically, we were just patching up women and  feeding them back into the system. We  were protecting women from the strong feminist perspective that made such fundamental  transformations in each of our lives. We  spent a lot of our time working on law reforms and pressuring police and doctors to  be a little bit kinder to "rape victims".  We counselled a woman individually, all  the while reassuring her that yes, indeed,  there were hundreds of women out there  just like her. It was hard to realize that  we were perpetuating our own and other  women's unfreedom.  "And that's violence too.  "Are we not continuing to be violent to  ourselves when we keep women separated and  divided from each other? When we don't  tell women out there and here beside us  all the truth? When we continue to define  it as "us" and "them"? When our analysis  tells us we need a new way, a new system,  and we continue to fight for half the loaf?  When we settle for reforms?  "When we mimic and shore up the very institutions and services we are trying to  break down? When we back down and don't  speak out strongly against cutbacks in  funding, in abortions, UIC, welfare, social  services, because we're afraid we'll lose  the approval of our funding sources or  because we don't believe it matters?  It's time to push forward again  "We've spent ten years building this community, our alternatives. And we must not  now work simply to perpetuate ourselves.  This is the time to be a movement — to  • push ourselves forward again.  "And yes, there will be resistance and objections and penalties.  "Governments don't fund revolutionary  groups for long!  And governments will not approve:  * when we say we no longer believe in the  criminal injustice system  * when we say we no longer believe in  health care for profit  * when we say we no longer believe in an  educational system that produces children  who don't know how to think for themselves  * when we say we no longer believe that  lesbians, women on welfare, handicapped  women, older women and children need to be  scapegoated and punished.  * when we say we no longer believe that  different skin colours and different languages are barriers we can never cross  * when we say we no longer believe in  prison reform, but want to abolish prisons  * when we say we no longer believe in wars  and in the destruction of our earth  * when we say we no longer want a piece of  this decaying, dying, rotting system  * when we say we don't want a safe community  * when we'say we will not stop until we  have our freedom!  And we will not get that without more work  — without thoroughly evaluating where we  are now, as individuals, as groups, and as  a movement  "We must plan where we, as individuals, as  groups, and as a movement want to be in  five years, in ten years. We need visions.  "We must remember that our goal is Transformation and that to end women's oppression means to struggle through the collective actions of a mass movement of women.  "We must remember that being feminists  necessarily means we are politically radical anti-capitalist, anti-racist, anti-  he terosexist, anti-imperialist.  "We must create situations where women can  move towards feminism and then be rapidly  integrated into the women's liberation  movement. We can miss no opportunity to  get the message out — to raise women's  consciousness by emphasizing the real life  issues that most affect women — to motivate the woman at home,in the suburbs, at  work in the factories, typing in the  offices, caring for the children, studying  in schools, watching TV, shopping... to  motivate them to act.  "Everyone needs some explanation of the  world and where our lives and work fit in.  If we don'.t supply the radical theory,  women will absorb what is already there  (liberalism, nature, religion)  ."We need to go public as radical feminists,  to share our knowledge and our analysis,  to take pride in our politics, to respect  women enough to tell them all the truth,  to develop and pass on tools that women  will find useful in their own hands so that  they too can pass them on.  Feminists are made, not born  "It seems like it's time to settle in for  the long haul in the '80s. Resources are  scarcer, we are tired. Most of us are recognizing that we are all in a state of  perpetual rape — and we know that to win  our place as autonomous beings, will be,  for us, a permanent battle.  "But I don't want to huddle in my community.  I don't want an individual solution. I  don't want to be happy by being oblivious  of your pain.  "We can dare to take ourselves seriously.  Join a group. If the group you're in is  not meeting your needs or furthering the  goal of ending oppression, speak up and  change that. Dare to take a stance out of  the ordinary.  "All groups need support and encouragement.  We all need the respect.that comes from  being direct and honest with each other,  constructively criticizing and appreciating  each other's politics and actions.  We can't allow them to pick us off  "We must join together, as groups, clearly  define our basis of unity and begin to be  accountable to each other. When VSW loses  its city funding, it is all of our responsibility to be there and to demand a retraction of that decision. They must not  be allowed to pick us off one by one!  "We can create new alternatives to the  system and act together to draw more and  more women into the movement. We can  share responsibility for our handicapped  women, our older women, for our children.  We can work with these women and children,  not simply for them.  "We can begin to address economic disparity  and to share our incomes — among  groups and individuals.  "We can hear each other's ideas and learn  to deal with the challenges raised by  these ideas. We can dare to dream, to  plan for our future, we can dare to live  in new ways, taking risks and pushing  ourselves one step further." 0_ Kinesis April 80  WOMEN AND WORK  Five massage therapists enjoying their work with you  In the second of our series of interviews  with women who enjoy the work they do,  Janet Beebe talks with five massage therapists who have begun to meet regularly for  sharing and support.    Their enthusiasm for  their work was hard to contain at times; we  hope that other women will be inspired by  it.  KINESIS: How did you each <  started in  PATRICIA (HONEY): I was taking physiotherapy because of a car accident. I thought  I might become a physiotherapist, but when  I looked at the science requirements, I  knew I'd never qualify.  So when I started to get massages, I asked  my massage therapist about training. For  •the duration of my treatments, she talked  to me about going to school, which was the  Canadian College of Massage. It takes absolutely nothing to get in there as long as  xyou have the money and have graduated from  high school.  Fees have tripled since then, but at that  time, it cost me $1075. I went to night  school (there's only a day program now).  It was three nights a week and I worked in  the daytime. I also had a loan from the  B.C. government. I loved school, it was  great. I graduated in April 1978.  It was one of the best things I've done in  my life. I needed a goal and this was just  perfect for me. It's not only that I love  it, but I can expect to make a living at it.  I was so high doing this — busy all day  working, and going to school at night. I  was totally thrilled with the idea. Before  I went to massage school, I worked at Transition House, and before that at clerical  jobs. I also worked at a beauty salon.  I  loved washing hair! That was my start in  massage.  PAULETTE: I was doing a lot of massages on  friends, and I was getting good feedback.  Then I took a course in psychic healing.  At that point my father got sick with cancer, and it really drew me to natural healing. I saw massage as a way to get involved  with that.  I trained at 3H0 in Toronto, which now  doesn't exist. It had a spiritual , intuitive approach to massage. It was an evening  course, 12 hours a week for a year — it  cost me $60 a month — and I worked during  the day with the Women's Travelling Medicine  Show. The Medicine Show was a collective of  women who were teaching yoga, nutrition and  massage to single mothers and women on low  income.  TRICIA: I got introduced to massage when I  was at Mt. Baldi, a monastery just outside  of Los Angeles. I have an old back injury  which can be agonizing.  I was in the middle  of a retreat, and having this pain, so I  told the head of the retreat that I was in  trouble. Very coincidentally, a massage  therapist tripped in mid-retreat and said if  anyone was in any kind of trouble, she could  do something for them. So she worked on my  back, and I couldn't believe what happened.  The change was dramatic; I had been in such  incredible pain.  I was so grateful.  I didn't immediately go out of that thinking, I'm going to become a massage therapist. I went on with my life, in the mad  circles it was going in, but eventually  everything in my life just lined up — and  massage is a natural part of that.  Before, I had been working with retarded  children at Woodlands. Working with retarded children was beautiful, but working at  Woodlands was terrible. I was doing a job  that I liked, but I kept on bumping into  the institution. I was looking for something that I considered "right" work, where  I could really give, and not be controlled  or limited. So I really appreciate working  on my own.  I trained at the Canadian College, the same  place that Patricia trained. I have very  mixed feelings about Canadian College. I  was sort of a political guerilla most of  the year.  I fought for a lot of changes.  It was expensive — $2300 when I went, the  year after Patricia did.  It had become an  11-month day course by then. It was intense, it was like being in a sweat think-  tank with 30 other people for 11 months.  But I grew — my whole life changed.  JACKIE: I got started by doing a day-long  massage workshop at Simon Fraser Women's  Centre. ?5y interest came from getting  Rolfed. At that time, what it took to become a classic Rolfer was a lot more weight  than I have. So I considered chiropractic  and other ways of working with the body. I  did the massage workshop so I could massage  my friends  I was going to school part-time and working  part-time at the Health Collective, but I  soon realized that I could do massage for  a living. I went to the Canadian College  at the same time as Tricia. We were sister  guerillas.  ANN: When I went into training, I didn't  know whether I would practice when I came  out. I had raised a family, but was really  unhappy with the work I was doing.  I'd  been separated from my husband for a number  of years, and I knew I wanted to make some  very basic changes in my life. I decided  to go out and learn a skill.  The curriculum I'd seen at the Canadian  College really interested me, but I was  scared of going because I hadn't been in  school for years. I'd raised children,  and given birth, yet didn't really have a  clue about my body, about physiology or  anatomy.  It was an incredibly intense year at'school.  I was excited, but also appalled, by the  amount of work we were doing. "When I came  back to B.C., I failed the Boards the first  time that I sat them. I sat them again and  passed. I realized that I wanted to do this.  I did not want to do anything else.  The office work I had done before had been  dull and routine, and I'd always been subject to someone else's authority.  It's  been a really exciting experience for me to  be self-employed, having to make my own  decisions, though I've also found that difficult. V.e're totally on our own. But  there's also a tremendous challenge to that.  I'm directly responsible to the people I  work with, and I like that.  JACKIE: I've felt that too. The lack of  structure can be difficult. It might be  easier if I were working with a group of  therapists meeting, say twice a month, so  I'd get feedback.  KINESIS: Has that ever been done?  JACKIE: What I would like is a supportive  group with a loose structure, where there  could be information sharing. Something  like this group.  KINESIS: What is this group?  TRICIA: We haven't really defined ourselves yet. We're still talking about what  we need as individuals. I need to be<.  supported by other people doing the same  kind of work I'm doing.  PATRICIA: Paulette and I have developed a  good relationship, and we give each other  a lot of support. I'm really glad she's  been around. We talk about general problems and frustrations much more than specifics. It's been tremendous.  It would be nice to have that with more  people. We met at one time with all the  new therapists within the provincial association, but it didn't work. Most have  the support of one or two people, and that  seems to be enough.for them.  ANN: We're part of a bigger association,  the Association of Physiotherapists and  Massage Practitioners of B.C. Physiotherapists comprise ten times the number  of massage therapists, and within that  group it's difficult for us to function.  We are not an autonomous body. This makes  a big difference in our relationship with  the medical profession.  PATRICIA: Massage therapy is only recently  recognized, and still most doctors are not  familiar with it. They don't see it as  something to refer people for. Massage is  covered by MSA, though. Each person is entitled to $75 for physio and/or massage a  year. Use up your medical, you're paying  for it.  But also, it's the image of massage.  There's still the body rub image.  There  needs to be more education and information  about massage.  I think that's happening  now'because the profession is growing,  and we're out there saying 'this is what  massage is', as opposed to body rub.  KINESIS: How many massage therapists are  there in B.C. ?  ANN: About 120.  JACKIE: But the schools are growing rapidly. The only schools are in Ontario, but  lots of people in the schools are from  B.C.  PATRICIA: There are two schools, the Canadian College of Massage, and Sutherland-  Chan School of Massage. Sutherland-Chan  is not accredited yet because it's quite  new.  KINESIS:    What's the enrolment in the  schools right now?  JACKIE: There's 40 in this year's class,  but not all of them will practice massage  when they finish. Counting both schools,  probably 100 a year.  ANN: You know, we walk a fine line between being clinical therapists and holistic practitioners. In my practice, I  work more than half the time with "clinical" cases, but there are a growing number  of people who see massage as a means of  having good health.  TRICIA: Getting in touch with our bodies,  I think that's the key. Many people take  that very seriously, and massage is incredible for that.  PATRICIA: It's a great preventative. I'm  always asking people why they don't come  for a massage, and they say "I don't feel  quite that bad yet..." as if they have to  be in pain! Most of my business comes  from women in the (feminist) community.  A few of us (massage therapists) have also  started to exchange massages among ourselves .  PAULETTE: It helps my work. I learn a lot  from exchange massages.  KINESIS: You're supposed to be relaxing!  ANN: I find it's not as easy to give over WOMEN AND WORK  to a massage now. I have a whole new perception of what's happening, and that's  helpful, but it also gets in the way at  times.  JACKIE: That happened to me for a while,  but even so, if I want to learn something  from someone, I have to really pay attention, or it's gone. It makes me wonder  how much people are hearing me.  ANN: I don't like talking to people while  I'm massaging them, because I can't give  my full attention if I;m trying to communicate on a verbal level as well.  I usually  suggest that they ask me questions after-  What I do find, though, is that I often  notice things about people I'm massaging,  and wonder if they want to hear about my  observations. Things about breathing and  posture that I feel could be improved if  they were more aware of it.  KINESIS: Are any of you connected with  the Preventive Medicine Centre at 10th  and Alma.  PAULETTE: Three of us work out of there.  KINESIS: My feeling is that a lot of  people see massage as a luxury item, and  I have tended to see massage as quite privatized — many massage therapists work in  very isolated situations.    So connections  with other health workers would seem to be  essential, if only to make massage more  accessible and to change its image in  ; minds.  ANN: What I'm trying to do right now is  build up connections with other people in  the medical profession. I just made contact with a chiropractor. We would like  to work together with people who need both  our services. We feel that if we work side  by side, we will each see much more happening.  JACKIE: I think those connections are  really important too. There's traditional  western medicine and there's the holistic  health approach, and it's really essential  that the two begin to work together.  There's no way it can go on as if they're  " opposed.  It doesn't make sense, and it  doesn't work.  People are suffering from  ineffective health care, from one end of  it or the other.  It's important for me to work with people  who are working from other models and to  blend approaches, rather than to say,  'that's different from my approach, there-  ' fore it's wrong'.  TRICIA: I see taking a more eclectic, pre- .  ventive approach to health care, where we  don't just go east, or go  west, and I see  a big place for massage in that. Both east  and west have something to offer. We need  to understand better the kinds of problems  we're faced with, and to tailor the health  care we're offering in a more personal way.  ANN: Massage is a way of putting people  more in touch with themselves, and making  them better able to deal with their own  health needs.  TRICIA: Massage does that wonderfully.  You don't take the power. You're a resource person, giving people more information about themselves. They keep the  power, so it's'not mystified. That's  important.  JACKIE: It's hard for some people to  handle that one, too. You can give someone different approaches as to how they're  going to start using their body differently  One approach may be very gentle, another  much more vigorous, and they can choose  which feels like it would work for them.  TRICIA: I often get people asking me very  elaborate questions like "What did you  find? What can you tell me about myself?"  ANN: I spent a lot of time giving people  very basic information, information I got  when I went to massage school, that I  hadn't had before. I didn't know it when  I was in my late forties.  JACKIE: I see part of my role as educational. If I spend two hours showing  people pictures of how muscles work, how  it could happen that they're in the condition they're ir, and what can be done —  they're usually amazed. So education is  really valuable.  It's not just giving  people intuitive consciousness, but giving  them something really concrete to look at.  KINESIS:    What about your work patterns.  Do you. find the pace comfortable?  JACKIE: I'm still feeling that one out.  I started practicing fairly recently, and  I still don't have a full case load.  ANN: This business of pacing oneself —  I'm finding I have more energy than I  thought I had, and I seem to be able to  draw on more energy. But I have had to  learn when to say no, which is not always  easy.  I have a full case load right now,  and it is difficult. I do have a slight  anxiety about what's going to happen two  months from now when everyone feels so  much better, and doesn't heed massage!  KINESIS: Would you class your job as more,  or less,  stressful  than the ordinary job?  ANN: It's so different. I feel so much  better doing it. I've got more energy because I feel good doing what I'm doing. I  wouldn't have as much energy if I were  doing it for someone else.  KINESIS: What do you see in the future,  for massage therapy, and for yourselves?  ANN: Somebody told me it was the best  profession I could have chosen, because I  won't need to retire from it! I'd never  Kujundzic  thought about that, but I think it's absolutely true. I was at a convention of  American massage therapists, and I couldn't  get over the number of people there who  were in their sixties and seventies. I  was hard put to find anyone under thirty.  And these people in their sixties and  seventies were putting in incredible days  that I wouldn't have thought of working.  PAULETTE: I've been working as a massage  therapist for four years now, and I think  I'm going to stay.  I feel a commitment  not just to massage, though, but to natural healing. I feel I'll be doing that  for the rest of my life. One thing about  this work, it's always evolving. I feel  as if I'll never get to where I want to be.  JACKIE: whatever I do with massage, what  I'm doing now will be with me, and will  probably find use. I find it hard to say  that in ten years I'll be doing massage,  because four years ago I would not have  said I'd be a massage therapist.  TRICIA: I feel we're on the brink of a  revolution where east does meet west,  where we see bodywork appearing from a lot  of different places. Essentially, there  is no separation between the body, mind  and spirit. I think what bodyworkers are  saying is that our bodies are much more  subject to the wonders and traumas of life  than we've been led to believe in this  western tradition.  KINESIS:    We've talked about massage being  less mystified than traditional medicine,  which I think we can safely assume.    I'm  interested in the connection bewteen you,  who are trained massage therapists, and  the people who see you and perhaps do massage informally because it feels good.    What  do you do to help people take their health  care into their own hands?  JACKIE: I was only in school for one year.  Even though it was bombardment of information, it was only one year, and I haven't  forgotten what I used to call my "legbone"  So I don't have a hard time with the people  who come to me.  I know there are differences between me and people who haven't  been to school. We probably have different  approaches. Massage therapists use a medical model a lot of the time. But it is  certainly possible to educate yourself.  PAULETTE: I really encouragetpeople to  help themselves. I often show people  charts of their hands and feet, and teach  them exercises or massage points that I  have found work for specific things.  TRICIA: I'd like to end by saying that  making the decision to uproot your life to  go all the way to Toronto is quite unbelievable, as is the first taste of school.  Not only because you're heaped with work,  as well as a language and terminology  you're probably not familiar with, but  also because as students, you put demands  on yourselves and each other to learn and  to grow. It's an acceleration year, a  year where you're going 90 mph, as opposed  to the 10 you might have been going before.  But all that considered, having uprooted  and having gone to Toronto, then coming  back to Vancouver, to see if there's anybody still here you know — it's worth it.  It's the most incredible kind of work that  I've ever done. Q  Details: Canadian  School of Massage, P.O. Box 983, Sutton  West, Ontario LOE 1R0; Sutherland-Chan  School, 732 Spadina Ave, Toronto M5S 2T9  Foot-in-mouth disease appears  chronic among commissioners  The B.C. Human Rights Commission has been  trying to behave itself. But foot-in-  mouth disease struck again at the commission meeting March 4-  At that meeting, the report from last December's human rights conference —  sponsored by the commission, the Secretary  of State and the Canadian Council of  Christians and Jews — was released.  Among the 108 recommendations contained in  that report, one called for an increased  representation by women on the commission.  Oh yes, very important, very important, the  commissioners muttered, eager to do right,  for once. But commissioner Joseph Katz  just couldn't resist it. In an attempt to  sum up the discussion, Katz commented, "I  would like to say we (commissioners) are  all married"^ adding that the "distaff  side" shared concerns raised at the meeting.  "Only joking," said Katz after the meeting.  Miriam Azrael, of the British Columbia  Federation of Women, was at the commission  meeting. "I objected to Katz' 'joke' because it is indicative of the commissioners  habitual inability to take anything other  than a trivializing approach to human  rights.  "My greatest point of frustration is that  the media leapt upon this incident as if  it were the only important thing to say  about human rights. Representation of  women on the commission is important; the  human rights of prisoners is important.  Stupid jokes are important.  "Half of the commissioners' terms expire  in August. It is to be hoped that the  minister, at that time, takes the recommendation to appoint women seriously.  Why should that suggestion be regarded as  a joke?"  0_ OUR CHILDREN. OURSELVES  An introduction to the learning collective  How can we all learn best, and keep our power?  All of us in the Learning Collective have  contributed to this article. We've thought  and talked about ourselves alot in the  last couple of weeks, while one of us  took on the job of presenting our stuff in  written form. That person is me, Dorrie  Nagler. I'm the "I" that turns up here  and there. Otherwise the "we" speaks for  us all.  Our purpose with this article is to connect with more people in the community,  to have a place, be known, recognized,  grow. The questions we asked ourselves  were: "What does this school mean for us  in our lives?" and "How are we doing now?"  Here we describe ourselves as a school, as  a collective, and speak as people who've  worked on this schooling process for a  year or two. We hope to answer questions  we hear frequently, and engage you further  in the delights of learning with our  younger friends and the satisfactions.  Who are we?  Eight children, twelve adults aged 5 to 35;  childrens" ages range from 5 to 9 years.  Some of us are parents, though not all,  some are single parents, some work full time  at paying jobs, almost half of us receive  welfare, some children went to straight  school, others not, some adults went to  university — maybe half.  Looking at our class background, again  about half n' half working class/middle  class; let's see: some of us call ourselves  feminists, all of us work with a personal  awareness of women's struggles. Some of  us are heterosexual, some are gay. Three  of us have vehicles. We want to make a  statement about how we are represented in  these groupings because we want to show  that as a schooling group we are egalitarian; that there is nothing necessarily  elitist about the collective, or what we  are doing. This concerns us.  We also make music, dance, are learning  carpentry, quilt, weave, treeplant, farm,  write, run tenaciously, make posters,  photograph, are involved in other co-operatives, and feminist ventures, sing, co-  counsel, mediate, and as ever — are involved with children. A long description  to make the point but worth it. We like  the way we are ... diverse, and together.  What is going on now?  We have reached, and passed many of our  initial goals. September before last we  were working in theory about being a collective, and the ways we should teach, the  limits we might set. Now we are dealing  in day-to-day practice, the details of our  teaching/learning, which reader a child  chooses, etc. All the children are reading, all are involved in math skill programs; none have been coerced, and yet  all are clear that we consider those "access skills" important.  We have learned to negotiate a balance  with each child between waiting until that  younger person is willing and prepared and  telling them that the particular skill is  essential because having it leads into  effective action. Such as working within  a group, making decisions together. Essential skills, that grow steadily, as we  are ready, as we are encouraged, and, as  examples are brought to our attention.  So we've reached a place of specifics —  we're doing it, we can see the details  are significant: for example, the tones of  voice. We get satisfaction in bringing  our dreams into the world, putting them  into motion, seeing how they will grow and  change with use.  In meetings we've learned to speak with  our feelings, and ideas, to stay up front  rather than back off when it's hard to  connect with someone else's views. When  I look through our minutes I know we're  remarkable, and that what we're doing works  when I see we've reached collective solutions for burnouts, car breakdowns, financial crises, scapegoating among the children... and we've been delighted to find  risking was worth it: we have changed,  are moved, are good for each other. Sense-  able! We know more and more what we're  doing, because we're doing it. We see the  effects of what we do, and we share what  we see. Meetings are pretty safe. This  includes children — yahoo! They have  just called a meeting to protest our arb-:  itrary decision to cut out special treats.  I get tears in my eyes when I hear my kids  speak to the co-ordinator, and ask her to  notify us of what they want.  What goes on at the school?  Arrivals — 9:30 getting ready, playing,  etc. until 10:00, then group time: any  hassles, news is brought forward, agreements are made ahout how people's toys  shall be handled, etc., then each person  tells Henry, any other adults, and the  "Many small happenings are special to us,  when a child speaks out and sees how  effective it is; or disputes are handled  independently and clearly, when two children persist in helping one another, do  favours, hug, touch, when a child sees  what is going on and asks for change —  we get excited! Lately two little girls  were commenting on how they were girl  friends, and one went on to say, "And  when we grow up we can be lovers." Yeah,  we can be lovers...!  Is there a teacher?  Henry is our regular teacher, coming all  four days of our school week. I come three  days, other members come regularly, as theiri  time allows — half days, full days. It's  usual to have two adults available at any  time. There is energy enough to do some  skill sharing and/or planning between  adults.  Henry has had seven years teaching experi-  Learning Collective  other children what they plan to do with  their day, and also how they want to do  their reading and maths. The children ask  for adult and/or child support if they  need it, and the adults work it out with  them. We call it contracting, exchanging,  agreeing. Then 10:30ish reading activities and projects sort of rotate and work .  into ll:30ish and math activities and projects, to 12:30 and lunch. The afternoon  is spent focusing on our own stuff, and in  finishing off any particular agreements  we've set up.  The children have been building boats;  three masters, tugs, fishing boats, and  building houses and farms which are growing into villages. Murals are gradually  fleshed out.  Through all this we share stories, dress  up, climb the mountains of earth outside,  listen to records, tapes, talk, build  worlds in the sand-table, wrestle, tickle,  snuggle, type, write letters, make clay  caves. Many times there is a child sitting, telling herself a story, or gazing  into the mirror, singing. Fantasy remains  big where we leave space open for it; it  doesn't go once kids start to read. All  this time we're sharing the space and  working all that through. Around 3:00 p.m.  we come together again, check out our feelings, settle unfinished business, choose  what we're going to clean up...and do it,  and then go outside: finito. "Seeing all  this reaffirms my belief that people can  be self starters, can go on to completion ..."  ence which has helped, yet was not "the  solution" to developing our own ways and  means.  "Passion is what is special in our day...  the children and ourselves are passionate  about our creations; it's not just an activity — we dream about'it and plan...  And we're passionate all round..."  Supplies? — Got lots of basics, including  wood-working tools  Spaces? — Lots; with sunlight, and clear  arrangement of activity areas. We're in  the Youth Hostel at Jericho Beach, so  around us are fields, bush, beach, mud mountains. There is a gym next door we use  2-3 hours a week.  What's different about us?  * the collective manner in which we work  together, and our fostering those practices with the children.  * our confirmation of individual needs is  put within a group context. We plan  space for learning at our own rate, in  our own way. We all negotiate.  * "we have movement, lots of time, room for  our curiousity, we give voice to our  values, experiences, emotions, politics,  intuition.  * we are friends; we are becoming more and  more direct and honest. Friends here  means equals, and wanting to be equals. ► OUR CHILDREN. OURSELVES  We each have ways of saying what's significant about what we're doing...  "Working with a group of people, putting  ideas out...and making it happen...more  instant gratification than anything I've  done."  "So important to hear the kids asking for  what they want!"  "...What the school makes me do...(it)...  makes me look at all these aspects in a  very personal way, encourages me to be  responsible, and to look at where I stand  and I get support within the group...I can  look, and then work towards a common strategy ...I can have power to get what I want  for my child...1 grow ■quite alot from  facing those decisions — and I'm given  support to do this."  "What we have come to is that we have to  act to make the changes..."  "...my chief satisfaction...our strength  ...we can make positive acts."  "We're working our way into the clear,  through to the good things in each other  ...we're slowly building that feeling of  trust...working on the details of how to  live in community — we gotta teach skills  about specific things...say blueprints and  group skills..."  "Always something very exciting and intimidating about beginning...crossing the gulf  to 'I'm going to do it'...and we find the  old ways rooted in all of us...we can get  caught... then we start to put together new  ways..."  "My kid has no blood relatives here, and  we're pretty new in town, the collective  takes that place — we do consider what  we do with each other ...we're not in isolation. "  "We intend to share power, we intend to  share information, skills, love — and we  don't let being a "school" get in our way  ...probably we will change a ways to accomodate us all!"  How do we fit into your life?  Simultaneously — In with your other com-  mitments, and with the involvement of your  close friends, partners, comrades, co-  parents .  Just as food co-ops cannot be as convenient  as your "One Stop Shopping" Safeway — so  we do not compete with the institutionally  zed schools. (At least not now, on our own)  However, the more people who share in the  work, the more reasonable the load becomes  for all of us.  "Us", here means all of us,  not just parents: child raising is a community responsibility.  Neither first nor second priority  When we say "simultaneously", we mean:  "not second; and not first priority".  Changing the way our kids are in this  world is as important as working to change  abortion laws.  The idea is not to choose  one over the other.  It is clear to us who the schools serve,  and whose values are taught, and that  oppressive power relationships are ever  present. The schools impose obedience,  conformity, and an ignorance of our right  to change our oppressive conditions. We  lose an ability to act in this most public  of places; strong emotions are "inappropriate". It is when we are together that  we should hear our voices, be heard, learn  to trust ourselves instead of bring shame  upon our friends for speaking out. Schools  coerce our belief in each others good intentions because we suffer for each other's  "disruptions".  Simultaneously — While we strive to make  some difference in the world, we depend on  that same system to teach our child "how  to cope", how to be "in the real world".  And how did we learn about the lies we were  taught — when we couldn't cope, and when  our friends couldn't.  Fancy teaching techniques do not hide the  power relations. There are no negotiations'  between children and teachers as equals in  the school system. How can a kid say "No"?  Directly?  Deciding to "undo" all these things at  home, and staying in the belief that "the  home environment is more important" only  isolates us from each other; each struggling to counteract the symptoms. How  much more empowering to join together, to  move away from that "instrumental" role  we must take if we stay isolated. Even if  the home environment were "more important"  what does that teach our children about  how important things/ways are learned?  And how much less important is the school  learning? Are we not' all fearful about  teaching?  How do we all learn best?  We're examining our experiences, asking  "How do we all learn, best, and keep our  power?" We are beginning, again, to take  back teaching skills, and put them to our  own uses. Our school/collective is a  prototype, a beginning. We want neighbourhood collectives. That's one of our dreams.  Now: specifics  The committee involves (at present):  * three meetings a month: two for business,  Learning Collective  one for issues  * if you have time, participation down at  the school in a manner that comfortably  leads to some planning and teaching responsibility (if you do not have time,  negotiate, please. Money is not a substitute here. )  * participation in putting on benefits and  other fund raising scams: three to four  times a year  * as you can, fee payments, according to  your income, again negotiable.  If there appears to be a serious stumbling  block, call us, there's a lot that can be  worked out. For instance, right now, there  are a couple of older kids who want to  leave school...perhaps if there were other  kids of that age something could jell.  Finally, come and see us — we're having  an Open House  down at Jericho, at the  Youth Hostel. To contact us ahead of time  phone 228-1084 or 253-3350.  And if you'd like to visit the school, or  come around to a meeting, ring ahead.  That way we can be sure we're not off  swimming or walking.  We're planning for next year, so come on  around, we'll be glad to see you. Q RAPE RELIEF  Rape Relief takes us on a tour of the local war zone  By Kinesis staff writer  Louise arrived at Rape Relief with two  paper bags of clothing, wet from the rain  and crying. Two nights earlier, while  walking to a phone booth to call a cab, she  was grabbed and pulled into a parking lot  in downtown Vancouver.  Despite her struggling and her loud appeals  for help, Louise was raped. No one came  to her assistance. She is 19, a student  living at home. Her parents believe, as  they have been taught, that a woman who  is raped is responsible for the event.  They have acted to restrict their daughter's activities. Louise does not want to  go home, at least for now.  Where can she go? Vancouver Transition  House is forced to turn away as many as it  accepts. For the thousands of Louises in  need, there is no safe place.  That is why Vancouver Rape Relief is  planning to open a women's shelter, to  serve victims^of sexist violence.  For the public announcement of their shelter plans, Rape Relief recently invited  members of the media on a tour of the war  zone. Over a two-and-a-half-hour period,  Rape Relief bussed media throughout Vancouver, making visible the systematic  nature of the violent control of women  through sexual assault (and the threat of  sexual assault).  One of us is raped every 17 minutes in  Canada. So Rape Relief spokeswoman Lee  Lakeman reminded us that while we were  taking our bus tour, another nine women  would be raped....  "I have never been free of the fear of' rape."  To introduce the bus passengers to the all-  pervasive nature of rape, Lakeman read us  a quote from Susan Griffin's "Rape - the all  ail-American crime" — "I have never been  free of the fear of rape. From an early  age, I like most women, have thought of  rape as being part of my natural environment — something to be feared and prayed  against, like fire or lightning."  She also gave a brief description of a few  of the women who have called Rape Relief  recently:  Joyce, 40. She was raped by her husband  and wanted VD information. He had called  the act "sex".' She had been trying to get  a divorce, and the court date is happening  soon.  Karen, 14. Her mother called to talk about  the father molesting Karen. We talked  about what could be done. We may meet  again.  Patricia, 15. She^as raped at work by a  co-worker and wanted to talk. We gave  her information about VD and pregnancy.  Kelly, 18. She wanted to know what to  expect from police contact. She had been  raped in the rapist's home. We talked  about police as well as alternatives.  And the list goes on.  The war zone tour starts out from Rape  Relief on Kingsway, and makes its way down  Main to the law courts. We pass the Cobalt  Hotel, scene of "continuous entertainment".  And MaeDonald's where the smile is part of  what's being sold. Bus services along  Main were cut back in July 1979. While  Rape Relief was protesting the cutbacks,  a woman was raped at a Main Street bus stop.  Past the porn shops around Main and Hastings. It's not reasonable to assume that  baby boys are born actually wanting to perform atrocities, Lakeman points out. They  have to learn. That's why there are textbooks for sale, in the porn shops. And  the one in every four women in Canada who  is sexually assaulted sometime in her life  testifies to the success of the teaching.  The images of women with brooms up our  Reporter discussing the war zone tour with Bonnie Agnew, of Rape Relief  raginas (to name a single obvious example)  put the lives of real women in danger.  "Acts of violence," Lakeman stresses,  "don't occur in a social vacuum. Pornography, objectified images of women in  advertising, popular music, film, the  lucrative and all-pervasive trade in  women's bodies and our sexist education  all teach, reinforce and support rape, incest and battering. Using women is big  business."  From the stores full of handbooks for  rape we make our way to the law courts.  The law courts prove that woman is property. If you can show that the property  is shop-worn, then there's no crime. If  you're poor, of colour, sexually active or  run-away, there's no crime. While the bus  pauses near the law courts, Rape Relief  worker Diane Freed acts out a partial  transcript of a rape trial, dramatizing  the fact that in court, it's the woman  who's on trial. This raped woman was subjected to a typical barrage of questions:  Had she had her drapes open, or closed?  Was she wearing pyjamas? Were they clean?  Had they already been ripped? You mean you  screamed for help and nobody came — do  you actually expect us to believe that?  Lakeman commented that those rapists who  are jailed (1.85?) are sent to jail for  acting out what they have been taught.  Their incarceration serves not to protect  women but to convince the rest of society  of its innocence.  Poverty: economic violence  Driving through the downtown eastside, the  war zone spokeswomen stress that poverty,  economic violence, is part of the systematic continuum of violence against women.  Lakeman read from a letter from a woman on  GAIN, a widow in the 50-60 age group. How  do you manage on welfare, the woman asks.  And answers:  "You pay the rent and utilities and you eat  less. Emergencies come up. Your grandchildren have birthdays, your clothes wear  out. You run out of cleaning products, bus  rates go up and again your food intake  goes down. You live with fear — fear  of the future, more illness, less money,  less pride...and you're afraid of dying  because it costs more to die than to live.  You're obsessed with maintaining your dignity and paying your own way out of this  world, even if you couldn't quite pay your  own way through it."  As we pass the war memorial at Victory  Square, Lakeman asks us to remember all  the women raped in every war, and all the  women who are today being beaten and ab  used. "Our war is still going on", she  explains. "We are still waiting for our  armistice day."  Then the tour proceeds to the retail and  financial district, taking a good look at  the window displays in Sears and Woodwards.  Young women, the Rape Relief workers  explain, are taught that "nice girls"  don't get raped.  "Nice girls" dress smartly, with some style. Over the last four  years, the fashion industry has invented  the "new femininity" — clothes that  hobble and confine. "Take a look at these  fashions," comments Lakeman, "and imagine  yourself trying to flee in those high  heels. Then remember that the street rapist is on the lookout for signs of vulnerability, and that the woman dressed in the  latest fashion would, in a rape trial, be  accused of having made herself appear  sexually available."  In the financial district, Lakeman explains  the myth of the unimportance of the work  women do. About 12%  of us work in the  office, retail and service sectors, where  we are largely unorganized, poorly paid,  and often hired on a benefitless part-  time basis. We are told that we work for  "pin money" but without our work, the downtown hives of industry would grind to a  halt.  Every month Rape Relief receives calls from  women who work in downtown stores and  offices. They have been sexually harassed.  And the media myth of the sexually available  secretary turns the women's dilemna into a  joke. The remedies for sexual harassment  through the ministry of labour, are limited  at best. Hence you have women's caucuses  in unions, and women's movement groups  like Rape Relief, Women Against Violence  Against Women, and Vancouver Status of  Women organizing to fight sexual harassment on the job.  Then it's down Robson Street to the west  end. We pass the Denman Theatre, where  "Cruising" is showing. "Cruising", points  out Lakeman, slanders the nature of gay  experience. Leshians and gay men are  frequently harassed for not being proper  pieces of the sexist machine.  In the west end, child prostitution is  most visible. Only now are the links between child prostitution and incest becoming clear. The vast majority of child  prostitutes have been sexually assaulted  by a family relative or friend. They  have been taught that sex is a service to  deliver, on demand, to a male authority.  While the bus moves through the west end,  the tour guides provide examples of rape  victims who have called from that area: ► RAPE RELIEF  Karen. She was assaulted in her 23rd  floor apartment, having been grabbed  from behind while entering her apartment.  The attacker threw knives at her, and slit  her wrists. Convinced that she was about  to be murdered, Karen fought him off.  Janet. She invited her date up for coffee  and he refused to leave. Under threats  of a beating, she went along with him. In  the morning, he called her "honey" and  promised that he would be in touch soon.  But there's no particular area of Vancouver where rapes are more common than  others. Stranger rapes, date rapes, neighbour rapes, incest rapes, rapes by husbands — all of them happen in all parts  of the city.  In the west end too, tourism is raking in  the bucks. Again, it has an ugly underbelly of exploitation: waitresses and  hotel workers, mostly unorganized and always underpaid, provide services for  others, which they can never enjoy themselves. The strike going on at Muckamuck  near English Bay, is an example of this  dynamic.  Along Burrard to St. Faul's hospital. One  out of every five women who have been  raped is seriously injured: a fact which  further belies the myth that rape is a  crime of sexual passion. Hospitals, however, persist in treating the raped woman  as evidence rather than as wounded. Many  hospitals — VGH and sometimes St. Paul's  — won't touch a raped woman until the  police pathologist turns up. This despite  the fact that kits for collecting forensic  evidence are available, can be used immediately by medical staff, and are in fact  in use in many hospitals throughout North  America, says Lakeman.  Over Burrard Bridge and up into Kitsilano,  passing.the Seaforth Armouries. Referring  to recent moves in the States to draft  women, Lakeman asks, "why does the military want us now?" The armed forces has  always been a poor man's college, but now  they can't get enough men. So to fill  their quotas, they have to expand their net  to include women. And this move they cover  with false debate about combat roles. Omitting to mention the fact that women are  always raped and killed in wars, they  piously intone that women are too gentle  to die. The U.S. male is anxious not to  have his women raped and killed by anyone  other than himself.  In Kitsilano, the Rape Relief tour guides  discuss the "jogger poster". Some months  ago, in response to repeated rapes by a  jogger in the Kitsilano-Dunbar areas,  Rape Relief postered the neighbourhoods  with warnings about the rapist's presence  and method of operating. Police were opposed to the postering because, they  claimed, it would alarm women. "Deliberately hiding a reality," said Lakeman, "does  not make that reality go away."  Jogger poster elicited a positive response  from neighbourhood women  In fact, the poster elicited a positive  response from women in the neighbourhoods,  she added. The.only abusive call about  the poster came from a jogger who complained that Rape Relief was giving joggers a bad name!  Then up to the leafy depths of Shaugnessy,  to The Crescent. The invisible women in  these homes are the immigrant domestic  workers, unprotected by even the most  elementary forms of labour standards.  The other women in these homes are the  wealthy ones. But even they are not immune. In 1976, police handled 40 calls  a day concerning "domestic disputes", a  euphemism for the ceaseless epidemic of  wife battering which crosses all class  lines. Women who call for help in  Shaugnessy, Lakeman explains, will quickly  learn that rape by their husbands is a  sanctioned activity.  Across Granville and down along 12th Ave.  an area where many older people live in  apartments. Women over 75, we are now  discovering, are often targets of neglect,  physical and verbal abuse. The sociologists call it "elderly parent abuse",  which masks the fact that the victims of  the abuse are mostly women.  To Vancouver General Hospital. This is  an area, Lakeman explains, that police  often refer to when speaking of women's  need for care when walking to their cars  alone at night...but still there is only  one school in Vancouver which teaches self  defence. Also at VGH, the Rape Relief  workers discuss the fact that 5.4$ of  raped women become pregnant, and affirmed  Rape Relief's position that women must have  the right to choose an abortion.  Then it's back to Clark and Commercial  Drives. As we re-enter the east end of the  city, the tour takes up again the theme of  immigrant women, unorganized women. Immigrants are denied childcare. Immigrants  can be deported for something called "wil-  full" unemployment! There are extra pressures upon women in immigrant communities  to stay with the family, abuse notwithstanding.. Work, and be silent, is the  message they receive.  As we conclude the tour of the war zone, in  the east end, Rape Relief emphasizes the  connections between those "carefully woven  whips of poverty and violence." On Venables,  Lakeman reads from a letter written only  blocks away.  It's about the reality of living, on welfare, in a violent situation: Living on  welfare is... "being told to go and find  a man, any man, who has a good job. And  latch on to him and let him support you  and your kids. It doesn't matter whether  or not you feel anything for him, you  don't have to marry him, you know...Being  told, we think you should try going back  to your husband. Back to what? Having  your nose broken a few more times and your  face looking like it's been through a  hamburger machine? Maybe this time he  would end up killing you or one of your  kids. To be asked if maybe you're not  exaggerating just a little bit...  "Then there are the people who know how  you feel, what you feel, what it's like  not to have enough of anything to go  around, how you should be raising your  family. In fact they just plain know  everything. Will somebody please tell me  how anyone can know how or what I feel unless they have walked in my shoes? We,  on welfare, are people, not statistics to  be stacked in neat little compartments.  I once heard a lady say, "We need the  poor, they teach us compassion^" I've got  news for that lady, find another way."  As we return to Rape Relief, the tour-  guides summarize the intent of this tour  of Vancouver, like any other North American city, a war zone of sexist violence.  "Today's tour," the media is told, "was  intended to draw attention to the realities of violence against women so often  ignored and mystified. And to ask for  support for this next stop in work against  rape in Vancouver, a Rape Relief women's  shelter."  "This house will be a residence, a safe  refuge, a place free from the threat of  violence. It will be an opportunity for  women to get and give support. With  mutual respect and trust, women, working  together, will begin to regain the control  that has been denied us."  Fund raising for refuge  Rape Relief has decided to fund this house  independently. Their experience with government contracts is that they would be  facing strings, yearly cutbacks, and annual' humiliating haggling about the economic  needs of the women in the house.  So far, Rape Relief has raised more than  $25,000 plus several ongoing pledges of  money, skilled labour and necessary household items. Past fund-raising events have  included a benefit dance, a festival, two  walk-a-thons along Stanley Park Seawall,  a mass mailing, sale of T-shirts and  buttons....  The next walk-a-thon around the seawall is  planned for Sunday May 4- Please contact  Diane or Chris at Rape Relief 872-8212 for  more information. 0_  VICTORIA GENERAL CUTTING OFF ABORTION SERVICES (cont. from p. 3)  According to one board member, the Victoria  General Hospital Board is "extremely vulnerable to being taken over by one-issue  candidates." Over half the board members  (nine of the 14) are elected by the hospital  society, which anyone can join for $2.00.  Three seats are up for election every year,  and it is easy for several hundred supporters  to swing an election and elect their one-  issue candidates. Jubliee is less vulnerable:  only four board members are elected.  Many of the doctors polled about the committee expressed displeasure with the federal  law requiring abortion committees to decide  -on abortion cases. Dr Shorting, chief of the  medical staff, said: "It's a bad law. Doctors are being forced to sit and pass judgement on a bad law. I can't see anything but  further problems unless it's changed."  The medical profession has, in general, criticised the abortion committee system ever  since it was adopted. A recent editorial in  the Canadian Medical Association Journal  said: "Doctors should not be forced to play  God or assume the function of gatekeepers to  decide which unwanted children should be  allowed into this over-populated world, and  which ones should not."  Dr Critchley, chairperson of Jubilee's  therapeutic abortion committee, believes  that "the choice on abortion should remain  between a woman and her physician."  At the opposite end of the spectrum lies  the Victoria General committee which rejects the World Health Organization definition of health - "a complete state of physical and mental well-being, not merely  the absence of disease or infirmity" - adopted by Jubilee.  The WHO definition of health, they say, was  "not intended for use in justifying abortions." Defining health strictly as the  absence of disease, they say that abortions  should be done "for significant medical reasons  only." Dr Mary Conley, who practises  at Jubilee, and has had several of her patients' abortion applications turned down by  the Vic General committee, commented: " So  if a woman has diabetes, multiple sclerosis  cancer of the uterus, then she may be eligible for an abortion. But a woman who has  three small children and a husband out of  work, and who is so depressed that she  can't .sleep or look after her children because of her distress at being unwillingly pregnant, would not be eligible.  Michael Butcher, executive director of  Royal Jubilee said: "Women are always  going to need abortions. If they aren't  provided in hospitals they will go to the  so-called backroom butchers. Abortion is a  service that is obviously required."  CARAL's spokeswoman Jennifer Lowen had this  to say: "The situation in Victoria is a  shocking example of the ambiguities of the  Canadian abortion law, with one committee  approving all abortions, and the other,  working under the same law, approving none.  The abortion law was passed 11 years ago,  and we are still fighting just to maintain  the status quo. Abortion must be removed  from the Criminal Code."  CARAL waging an active protest  On March 29, the Canadian Abortion Rights  Action League demonstrated in Victoria.  They focused public attention on the restrictions at Vic General, the anti-choice  statements'of B.C.'s health minister Rafe  Mair, and the archaic nature of federal  abortion laws. $> FEMINISM AND THE LEFT  Women and Socialism: accounting for our experience—a review  By Helen Mintz  ."Women and Socialism: Accounting for our  Experience" is a pamphlet written and  published by the Vancouver Women's Study  Group (VWSG).  The pamphlet addresses the  question which the VWSG sees as the principal weakness of the left in regards to  women. That is, the division between men  and women of the working class. The  VWSG points out that "in the struggle to  [ build a real unity of interests among men  and women it is crucial to understand the  divisions, how they have developed, how  | they are maintained and who has an interest in maintaining them".  This is important theoretical work. In  analyzing this question, the pamphlet provides an important place for socialist  and feminist women to begin to establish  when and how we will unite with men. Like  all work which breaks new ground, this pamphlet has weaknesses. I think that it  fails to deal adequately with the relationship between working class men and both  the capitalist and imperialist system itself and the capitalist class. Although a  short pamphlet cannot deal with everything,  in neglecting to look at the forces which  act on working class men, the pamphlet  fails to provide a clear analysis of the  material basis for men giving up the privilege they have.  The pamphlet analyzes division between  working class women and men by looking at  the position of women in the work force and  in the family.  Women in the workforce  There haj been a dramatic increase in the  participation of women"in the workforce  since world war two. Despite this increase,  the inequality of women's position has been  maintained. One of the central features of  this inequality is a labour force segregated by sex.  "The development of this  segregated labour market has not just  meant that men and women do different j<  in the society, but that women consistently  do the worst jobs."  According to the pamphlet "the segregation  of the labour force by sex is not essential  to the functioning of capitalist economies.  In fact, capitalism provides the possibility for the elimination of a division of  labour based on sex."  Thus the sex segregated work force is seen  to be principally a result of the response  of working class men to the threats to  their jobs posed by women entering the work  force. Although the pamphlet sees that the  sex segretated work force is "the result of  the combined actions and alliance of capitalists, the state, and trade unions", it  implies that it is the unions which are  principally  responsible for its maintenance.  This analysis of women in the work force  is useful for us in understanding.the particular form that women's inequality takes.  However, the VWSG has not sufficiently  analyzed the relationship between the male  trade unions and capitalism and imperialism.  Capitalism is based on the exploitation of  working people. Profit is created by the  labour of working people for which we are  not paid. While some workers may earn  more than others, workers generally are  not paid for the work they do. This is true  not only of organized male workers but as  well of the large pool of low paid workers (generally women and immigrants although not always) who are necessary to  the functioning of the capitalist economy.  Within the overall system of capitalism,  the difference between the two groups is a  difference of degree of exploitation.  White male workers have more often been  organized. They have often been in a privileged position in relation to other workers.  It has been clear that this position  of relative privilege is not available to  The main point we have been trying to make in the preceding sections  of this paper is that the experience of working class women is not only  different from that of working class men, but also that this difference  provides a material basis for divisions between women and men under  the current organization of society. These divisions cannot be overlooked or ignored in the name of unity. Understanding this point has  some very real implications for where and how we work politically.  There are situations where women's interests differ from men's, at  least in the short term, and women must engage in struggles which  work to further their interests, even when this means confronting the  interests of men.   _     Women and Socialism -  all workers under capitalism Thus, they  have had two choices. Either to fight for  a little extra for themselves or else to  fight against wage exploitation for all  workers.  They have chosen to guard their  privilege closely.  In challenging the  existence of wage exploitation in our  society, the unions would have been challenging capitalism, which they have, overwhelmingly, been unwilling to do.  I disagree however with the pamphlet's  analysis which sees the male trade unions  as the principal force in maintaining the  sex segregated work force and the unequal  position of women within the work force.  It is true that the trade.unions have protected their relative privileges, often at  the expense of gains for other workers.  But this has been because they have understood that the capitalists have not been  prepared to grant these privileges to all  workers. Thus, while continuing to exploit them by paying them less than the  value of their labour, the capitalists  have been able to stop many trade unionists from really challenging this injustice  Women and Socialism  9  Capitalism has stopped them by paying them  more than other workers are paid. It is  the old tactic of divide and rule.  It is important for us to understand that  the male trade unions have often stood  against us. But it is also important for  us to understand that it is capitalism itself which has been principally responsible  for a situation in which workers are exploited for their labour. It is the capitalist class which has played the principle  role in maintaining the wage exploitation  of women as well as men.  Women in the family  The pamphlet analyzes the changing role of  women within the family. "For capitalism  to develop it needed to expand beyond its  boundaries, move into new areas of production and seek new markets. Gradually it  took over most of the productive functions  previously performed by the family." This  is true not only in relation to the creation of products such as canned goods and  clothing, but also in relation to services  that range from cooking (restaurants) to  raising children (compulsory education).  Because of the flexibility of the work  that women do, both in the home and outside, they have been in a position to take  up the slack during the booms and busts of  capitalism.  The pamphlet points out that "in the vast  majority of cases, women who enter the  labour force gain an income but remain  economically dependent (on men)...This  dependence, and the resulting vulnerability and powerlessness of women, is most  commonly taken for granted as part of the  definition of family. The fact that women  do the housework and take care of the  children has the appearance of arising out  of human nature..." But, the pamphlet  goes on to point out, the experience that  women have within the family, is not the  fault of individual women, but rather  "determined by laws and regulations which  place women in a dependent relationship  to men."  The difficulty experienced by women in  taking action when we experience violence  in the family is just one of the countless  examples of such laws and regulations.  "Women and Socialism" points out that men  profit directly from the dependent role  that women play within the family.  The pamphlet does attempt to analyze the  relationship bewteen the ways in which  men, on the one hand, and the state on the  other, profit from women's oppression.  Unfortunately, this analysis is far from  adequate. When no longer necessary within  the labour force, female labourers have  been reabsorbed into the role of housewife  and mother with the individual or the  family bearing the economic burden of the  loss of income.  We can see that the capitalist class has  a large investment in maintaining women's  unequal relationship both in the work  force and in the home. In this way the  capitalists have not only had cheap workers whenever they needed them, but as  well, a work force which is bated, fed,  and emotionally pacified (somewhat anyways ).  In future work we will have to look at the  important trends within the workforce  affecting women's work. With the expansion of the white collar and service sector and the contraction of the industrial  and manufacturing sectors, jobs in the  areas in which women work are growing,  while jobs in the traditional male sectors  of the economy are declining in number. A  recent study of women's employment during  a period of recession in England showed  that although in particular situations  women are more vulnerable-than men in  regards to lay-offs, overall the sectors  in which women work are less hard hit  than the traditional male sectors. Thus,  the reality of women as a reserve, to be  pulled in and out of the work force, is  changing. * FEMINISM AND THE LEFT  "Women and Socialism" is an important beginning in challenging some of the shortcomings in existing analysis of women's  situation under modern capitalism. The  pamphlet examines women's experience from  a materialist point of view, giving valuable insights into our present situation  in relation to working class men, both in  the work force and in the family. This  work should be continued. It is only in  examining the basis for the division that  we can develop an analysis of how to 'overcome it.  I think that the principle shortcoming of  this pamphlet is its failure to analyze  the relationship between working class men  and capitalism and imperialism. According  to the pamphlet, the solution to the problem of building unity between men and  women rests with a choice that men must  make. "They can choose, as they have done  in the past, to side with the bourgeoisie  to maintain the privileges which they gain  from women's inequality; or they can sup- •  port women's demands for equality, at the  expense of privilege. The first choice  reinforces division; the second works towards unity."  But why in hell should men choose to give  up privilege? Certainly not so that they  can get into the IWD dance for three dollars like all the women (joke). No, men  will give up their immediate privileges  only when they feel that it is in their  interests to do so. And nothing convinces  like power. It is important that the  women's movement continue to develop. We  must deepen our understanding of the material conditions we face. We must develop  greater clarity around our demands and determination and effectiveness in fighting  for these demands.  But we can also examine the concrete advantages that men have to gain in relinquishing their immediate privilege. And it is  in examining the relationship between  working class men and capitalism itself  that we begin to see this. We begin to  see the ways in which men as well as  women are oppressed by capitalism. We  see the wage exploitation of both men and  women. We see the plunder of our earth.  We see how men suffer from their socialization which teaches them to expect nurtu-  rance. We see how capitalism oppresses  and dehumanizes all people. And so,  while many privileges accrue to working  class men through their oppression of  women, this oppression maintains division  between women and men. This division helps  to maintain a system in which both women  and men suffer, in which both women and  men are exploited. Men have been bought  off cheap.  As the crisis of imperialism deepens, men  in developed countries will experience increasing erosion of their privilege. Perhaps this will make their class situation  clearer to them. The advantages of allying  with women against capitalism and imperial  ialism may become more evident.  Really fighting against the capitalist  system demands that men stand side by side  Women and Socialism  with women and not on our heads. And in  standing side by side with us, they'll  have to give up privileges they would rather maintain. "This is the reality. But  men will not be convinced based on a moral  argument about right and wrong. It is the  strength of the women's movement and the  concrete effects of the contradictions of  capitalism on their lives that will convince them.  Women who see themselves as feminists and  marxists are trying to figure out the best  way to do political work right now. We  are trying to figure out how to relate to  both the women's movement and to the left.  The pamphlet points out that we often feel  alienated in both situations. "In some  parts of the women's movement when we raise  the issue of class, we are seen as being  too sympathetic to men and thus are suspected of selling women out.... Then in  the communist movement, when we raise  issues that are of particular concern to  women or question how more general issues  will affect women, we are branded as bourgeois feminists."  How to do political work  Unfortunately, the strategy proposed in  the pamphlet does not deal with this dil-  emna. The pamphlet suggests that "socialist women, like ourselves, could form  organizations which would continue to analyze and fight against women's oppression,  from a socialist perspective. Such an organization would not be formed around a  single issue campaign, although we would  of course take up specific issues in the  course of our work." I feel that this  type of broadly defined socialist feminist  organization would be a mistake. As socialist women we can work together around  clear and limited aims. This pamphlet is  an example of the important work that a  socialist women's group could undertake.  However there is no reason for socialist  women to form a separate organization which  would take up issues as they arise. Our  differences with the work of the women's  movement where they exist are not the specific issues which are taken up, but the  ways in which the struggles for these  specific issues are tied to a more long  term strategy for social change. Our role  is to support the work being done now while  trying to better make these links. We must  also attempt to convince left groups to  take up our concerns in the ways which we  feel are essential.  To conclude, I would recommend the pamphlet  as valuable reading. It is written in an  accessible style and furthers our understanding. The graphics are excellent,  providing a rare example of political  graphics that have some depth and subtlety.

'79 and Melanie's letter  Dec./Jan. 80) I believed home births  were the only way until I had my baby  four months ago.  'I had been persuaded by my husband to  have our first child in the hospital  (and any others would be delivered at  home thereafter) and I begrudgingly '  went along with his wishes. We had  planned as natural a birth as possible in  the hospital, with permission from our  doctor to have music, flowers, and the  set-up we liked best. Unfortunately complications occurred after six hours of  labour and I ended up with a Caesarian  section twelve hours later.  During the surgery they discovered an abnormal bony protruberance in my pelvis on  which my baby was stuck (undetectable  without surgery or x-ray).  It was pure  hell, but I would not be alive now if I  had had a home birth away from access to  a hospital.  Some people argue that you can be rushed  to hospital if something goes wrong.  In  my case, that would have meant extreme  pain and risk to my baby, due to fatigue.  But there are other complications in which  there may be only minutes to spare. It  seems we are only gratifying our own egos  to insist on a home birth and we're denying our babies the right to a safe journey  into the world. Why take the chances?-  The hospital staff, to my surprise, were  caring and supportive throughout. It  appears there has been some change in  attitude, but it is slow. Because most  women deliver normally I think a move  away from the sterile atmosphere of hospitals is a must.  Rather than giving the false impression  that a home birth is our only alternative,  I would like to see us push for a house or  section connected to the hospital similar  to those already functioning in California.  This way we do not endanger ourselves or  our babies but can still deliver in comfortable, homey surroundings. Let's continue to pressure hospitals and doctors  to change and allow the kind of place we  want rather than revert to the old way of  itome births with its attendant risks.  Sincerely,  Patricia Turner  I wish to respond to your article in the  February issue of Kinesis — "More than a  few lies in paradise".  I find the Women  Hating Advertising Tactics interpretation  of the Bahamas billboard degrading.  I most  certainly do not feel the woman is portrayed in a defenseless position, nor does  she look like a "helpless and willing victim. " It's this kind of drivel and brainwashing sarcasm that gives the Women's Lib  Movement a bad name — the obvious nitpicking over a pretty harmless ad.  I suppose if the couple were enjoying a cool  drink under a beach umbrella you could  charge them with insidiously contributing  to alcoholism, and if they were dressed in  Vancouver street clothes — with non-  conformism. Please restrict yourselves to  the things that matter — there are a lot  more obvious things than this.  Sincerely,  Nancy Boychuk  Smithers B.C.

ANTI-NUCLEAR
Make the anti-nuke, feminist connection (while you still can)
By Gayelle (aka Day-glo Tulips)
-Patriarchy as the reUgion of rapism legitimates all kinds of boundary violation...
it extends its blessing also to the violation of life itself by scientifically
"created" pollution, by the metastasizing
of a carcinogenic environment  — epitomized in the ever-expanding cities of the
dying  — and by the hideous weapons of
modern warfare.
Gyn/Ecology,  by Mary Daly
POLITENESS STINKS. The kind of politeness
where you sit still and don't bring up the
issue, that of nuclear energy, because
after all, Kate Millett is here and everybody's talking about crisis centres and
you don't want to interrupt.
TIMIDITY STINKS. The timidity where you're
dying to get up and say "hey — let's talk
about nuclear energy" but you haven't been
around the community that  long. As Mary
Daly says, what ever happened to the
movement?
Anyway, I went home feeling frustrated at
missing the opportunity to talk to a lot
of active women about nuclear energy, which
poses a horrific and very real threat to
the earth today, right now.
Y.Otiat does it all have to do with feminism?
The connection is obvious. As feminists
we are concerned with the quality (or lack
of it) of life in our world. So we also
have to be concerned about the environment
in which we are doing our living. That
environment is in grave danger of being
irreperably damaged. .
You might think that B.C. is a pretty cool
place to be living now that our provincial
government has "seen the light" (questionable ) and banned uranium mining and exploration here for the next seven years.
Well, that hardly resolves the nuclear
issue.
There's the Trident Nuclear Submarine Base
in Bangor, Washington which is one of the
first-strike targets in the event of a
nuclear attack. The U.S. and' Russia right

now have enough nuclear weapons to kill
everyone on the planet 12 times over.
Reportedly there are nuclear weapons at
the military base up on Vancouver Island
at Comox.     . .
The situation in uranium, mining, the first
stage of the nuclear cycle, is grim.
It just so happens that a mineral belt extending from Northern Saskatchewan through
to New Mexico is within the boundaries of
much land given to native Indians as reserve years ago. Hundreds of thousands of
acres have been leased by multinational
corporations who discovered that underlying
the land (the earth, in Hopi Indian philosophy is seen as mother and nurturer to
us all) are rich deposits of coal and uranium, which they want for profit, to fire
power plants and reactors, among other
things.
Miners have died and are dying of leukemia
from working in substandard and radioactive conditions. In New Mexico last .
year a dam broke, spilling millions of
gallons of radioactive water into the Rio
Puerco which supplies water needs to the
farmers and ranchers of the area. Houses
and schools have been built on radioactive
tailings (waste ore) and acres of tailings
lie exposed to the elements.
In South Dakota, more than two dozen
multinational corporations are preparing
for a major development (assault) of the
uranium and other resources of S.W. Dakota.
The Trilateral Commission, whose members
include government officials, advisors,
and heads of multinational corporations
(you may be interested to know that B.C.
Hydro's Chairman Robert Bonner is a member) has designated these Black Hills as a
"national sacrifice area" meaning that the
area resources will be stripped and left
largely uninhabitable.
THIS MADNESS MUST STOP AND NOW!! !
In the words of Dr. Helen Caldicott, anti-
nuclear activist, "We can no longer afford
to entrust our lives, and the lives and
health of future generations, to politicians, to bureaucrats, experts, or scien-
' tifie specialists....  The survivial of
our species depends on each individual."
April 26 is the International Day of Anti-
Nuclear Protest. In Vancouver, a massive
march and rally is in the planning stages.
The issue concerns us all. Bring everyone
you can, sisters, cousins, aunts, and
neighbours down the block. Get involved.
Our future depends on us all today. Cj
Concerned Citizens for Choice on Abortion
(CCCA) has greeted the spring with a
stepped-up campaign, including the March
22 organizing conference,  i'lt has become
more and more clear", said Ann Thompson
for CCCA, "that even the limited rights we
have been able to attain with respect to
the accessibility of abortion services are
in very real danger of being cut back or
eliminated."
Support for CCCA was reiterated at a March
11 press conference 'by representatives
from the B.C. Federation of Labour, the
YWCA and Vancouver Status of Women.
Spokesperson for the board of directors of
Vancouver YWCA was Susan Witter. "Ours
is a multi-cultural, pluralistic society
with a wide variety of accepted religions,
political beliefs and life styles," Witter
pointed out.  "We maintain that those who
do not believe in abortion need never avail
themselves of it, but we do not believe
that any group has the right to limit or
bind those who do not share like moral or
religious convictions," she concluded.
On Saturday, March 22, over 100 people
from Vancouver and across the province
attended a day-long organizing conference, designed to coordinate efforts to
defend and expand accessibility to abortion. It was an exciting, energizing day.
Participants attended workshops on organizing around hospital boards, the particular problems of rural women, alternative structures, province-wide organizing and repeal of the abortion law.
The conference endorsed the formation
of active, locally based committees to
CCCA escalates defence of abortion rights
be linked through a provincial network coordinated by CCCA.
The conference also proposed a plan of
action to include a series of local events
building to a Day of Declaration on Abortion Rights to be planned for late fall of
this year.
"It is clear that the time has come for
decisive action on this very fundamental
issue," said Ann Thompson.  "This will include not only defending our interests
through annual hospital board elections,
but working to ensure accessibility to
those services which already exist, promoting new and better services for women, and
repealing the federal law which puts restrictions on our right to choose." Q
Voice of Women has anti-nuke
tapes for rent
"I am petrified," says anti-nuke activist
Dr Helen Caldicott. "And why everyone else
isn't, I don't know." Caldicott goes on to
detail how we are collectively committing
suicide, maintaining national security by
mutually assured destruction.
Everyone in the northern hemisphere is
already contaminated, comments Dr Rosalie
Bertell. We have Strontium 90 in our bones
and Iodine 129 in our kidneys.
On March 19, the Voice of Women presented
an information afternoon at Robson Square
which featured several AV tapes of Caldicott
and Bertell. These tapes are available to
women's groups for viewing. Contact the Voice

On March 4, City Council turned down the recommendation of the Social Planning Department that VSW be granted $9,920 (one half of our  request) to reinstate an advocacy service for women.  VSW's ombudservice was discontinued in 1978, due to staff cutbacks caused by the  unwillingness of the. provincial government to fund this type of service. It has become  more and more clear, however, that women continue to rely on us for assistance in a  variety of social and legal areas.  Alderwoman Bernice Gerard has led a concerted campaign against our funding on the ground  that VSW has policies .advocating pro-choice on abortion and the rights of lesbians and  gay men. She has made it clear that she realizes that we perform important services fox  women in Vancouver, but that we must be made an example of.  In effect, Gerard i out to punish VSW and the woman who need our services and programs  because of hc-.r pers^.aa.l das ::gacci.icrt with two of car policies-  OUR APPEAL DATE IS APRIL 29 at 7.30 p.m. in the evening.
