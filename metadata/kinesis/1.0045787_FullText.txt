Now in its fourth year, the  project already has up to 600 individual  panels.  Says co-founder Pat Erickson, the Banner Project is a safe way for survivors to  express themselves together while staying  anonymous, if desired. The Banner is displayed by rallies, women's groups, and survivors' organizations and has been shown  around the US and in Nova Scotia.  Individual panels are eight and one-  half by 11 inches, the size of a sheet of  letter-sized paper turned sideways. Survivors paint, draw, embroider, or applique  their handprints and any message they want  onto their cloth. A one-half inch border is  left all around the edges so the panels can be  sewn together. Individual panels are sewn  up into large panels, each about 13 feet long  by 8 feet high.  Madeleine Para, a worker for the National Organization of Women (NOW) in  the US and co-founders Erickson and Sandy  Booth began the project in the spring of  1989 in response to Sexual Assault Awareness Week.  Feminist groups wanting to display one or  more of the large panels (for only a shipping  charge), and survivors wanting more information can write: The Banner Project, P.O.

An explosion by anti-choice extremists destroyed Dr. Henry Morgentaler's  abortion clinic in Toronto last May. BCCAC  urges women to act to strengthen their right  to choice on abortion in the face of well-  funded attacks from anti-choice groups and  their campaign to forcibly deny women the  right to reproductive choice.  Twenty-five percent of monies raised by  the appeal will go to the Morgentaler Chnic  Rebuilding Fund to enable the chnic to reopen. The remainder will be used by BCCAC to maintain a strong pro-choice movement in Canada that is ready and able to  defend women's right to choice.  You can also join the BCCAC monthly  donor plan.

KINESIS  Indigenous Woman is an official publication of the Indigenous Women's Network  (IWN), a continental and Pacific network  of women actively involved in community  work. The publication is part of a commits  ment by these women to "work within the  framework of the vision of (their) elders" to  rebuild families, communities, and nations.  IWN emerged from a gathering of about  200 Indigenous women in Yelm, Washington, in 1985. Women from the Americas and  Pacific came together to tell their stories,  present testimony as to conditions in their  countries, and strategize on ways of making  a better future for their famiUes and communities. Issues discussed included pohtical  prisoners, land rights, environmental degradation, domestic violence, and health. The  Indigenous Women's Network was formally  organized in 1989.  IWN's membership is comprised of Indigenous women (voting members), and  others (supporting members). Membership  dues are $15 US annually for voting members, and $25 US for supporting members, both organizations and individuals.  All members receive periodic updates and  the bi- annual publication.  Indigenous women are invited and encouraged to submit articles, poetry and  artwork/graphics within the visions of this  magazine. Send copies only and include  stamped, self-addressed return packaging if  you wish items returned. For further information, write: IWN, P.O.

Woman to  Woman  Woman to Woman, a Global Strategies  Committee, is a Vancouver-based group designed to bring women together to better  understand the implications of global restructuring and the new Corporate Economic Order. This includes the Free Trade  Deal between Canada, the US, and Mexico.  Woman to Woman will sponsor a series  of discussions in the fall. The first discussion topic is: "How Will the North American Free Trade Deal Affect Women?" Also,  a Jamaican filmmaker will be in Vancouver  to present her video on The Jamaican Debt.  For details call 875-9159 after September 9.  A female representative of National  Democratic Front will be in Vancouver on  October 26-29 to speak on her experiences  with international involvement in the peace  process and how this relates to women. Details of this event will published in the October issue of Kinesis.  Corrections  In the last issue, we printed the wrong  phone number for Cate Jones, Project  Coordinator for the Women's Monument  Project. The correct number is 254-3831.  And in our story on the LU Softball tournament, "... and some just play ball!" we  mistook the Ratz for the Bratz. The Ratz  received the Competitive Division Consolation Award and a Ratz teamplayer is responsible for "the best quote" summing up  the spirit of the games: "we keep losing and  we keep playing ... I don't understand it."  And in our June 1992 issue, we erroneously quote Kelly Maier saying, BC's  Family and Child Services Act defines "a  child" as a post-partum person under 19.  There is, in fact, no such definition - Kelly  was suggesting there be one.  Inside  Kinesis  Welcome back!! Hope you enjoyed your  summer. We didn't have much of a break  at Kinesis.

On July 31, four national feminist organizations representing some 500 women's  groups, withdrew their support of the Panel  after the minister responsible for the status  of women refused to appoint women with  disabihties and more women of colour to the  Panel.  Since its establishment a year ago, the  Panel's many shortcomings, including the  lack of meaningful representation of women  in Canadian society and accessibihty have  drawn criticism from individual women and  women's groups [see Kinesis July/Aug,  1992].  The four organizations—the DisAbled  Women's Network (DAWN), Congress of  Black Women of Canada (Congress), the  Canadian Association of Sexual Assault  Centers (CASAC), and the National Action Committee on the status of Women  (NAC)—puUed out of the Panel's 23-  member advisory committee.  "Being on the Advisory Committee  doesn't help Black people in this country,"  says Justine Blake-Hill, president of the  Congress of Black Women of Canada  Women of colour and women with disabihties have caUed for representation on  the Panel similar to that fought for and won  by Aboriginal Women. The four-member  Aboriginal Circle, appointed the same time  as the advisory committee, were given equal  participation on the Panel.  The Native Women's Association of  Canada (NWAC) supports the demands for  greater representation of women of colour  and women with disabihties but not at the  expense of aboriginal representation.  The minister, Mary CoUins, in denying the request for direct appointments of  women of colour and women with disabihties to the Panel, offered instead to appoint  special advisors recommended by NOIVM,  Congress and DAWN. However, special advisors would not have any greater puU than  advisory committee members and would be  limited to discussing issues laid out by the  Panel. The three groups rejected the compromise.  "What the Panel [was] saying to us is,  'you're going to stay in the kitchen, whUe  we dine in the dining room'," says the  Congress' Blake-HiU.  The Panel foUowed up the controversy by  issuing a 28-page progress report on August 20. The report contains nothing that  has not already been said countless times by  women's groups, transition house and rape  crisis centre workers.  "This report isn't saying anything new.  In fact, it's regressive—it's taking us back  before the [June 1991 parliamentary subcommittee report,] War Against Women by  not looking at the power relations between  men and women," says Sunera Thobani, co-  chair of NAC's campaign on male violence.  The report makes a number of recommendations, including restating a longstanding caU for immediate permanent and  adequate funding of transition houses, sexual assault centres, women's centres and national women's organizations.  But Lee Lakeman of CASAC is concerned  that the Panel's report did not go far in  stating that funding must come from the  federal government. "This is a bad funding mechanism for women's groups. As direct services and education are provincial  responsibihties, the federal government can  shirk off its responsibihty for funding these  organizations."  Regarding women of disabiUties, "the report does not reflect [our] reaUties in any  way," says Shirley Masuda of DAWN. There  has to be recognition that "women with disabihties are the most assaulted and abused  of women in Canada. We exist among every  group of Canadian women," she says.  Beverly Bain of the Toronto ad-hoc  women's group, The Coalition of Seven,  criticizes the report for not addressing violence against women in a systemic way.  "The Panel does not criticize government  pohcies representing the status quo which  perpetuates and institutionahzes violence  against women [nor] does [it] make a real  attempt to show the Unk between violence  against women and sexism, racism, classism, albeism, and homophobia," says Bain.  "They see violence against women as  an isolated thing of men beating women  at home," says MUagros Paredes, also of  the Coalition. "The Panel doesn't understand what it means to eradicate violence—  eUminating wars, cutting defence spending, working against racism, sexism, and  poverty,"  In fact, the only thing 'new' in the Panel's  report appears to be a call for 'zero tolerance' of violence against women. But NAC's  Thobani says that calling for zero tolerance  won't end violence. "NAC is calling for zero  violence, not zero tolerance."  Native women and the Constitution:  Doors open on talks  by Miche Hill and Fatima Jaffer  In what appears to be a precedent-setting  case, a federal appeal court says the Native  Women's Association of Canada (NWAC)'s  constitutional rights to free speech have  been violated by the federal government's  choice to exclude them from constitutional  talks, [see Kinesis, May, 1992].  "This is the first time a Canadian court  has ruled on the right of a woman to freedom of speech in a pohtical process," said  Sharon Mclvor, a lawyer from Merritt, BC,  who is named in the suit. "And [the court]  has recognized that this right has been infringed by Canada."  In their unanimous ruhng on August 20,  the three judges lambast the federal government for acting against the interests of Native women. Justice Patrick Mahoney writes  that, "by inviting and funding the participation of [four other Native] organizations in  the current constitution review and excluding the equal participation of NWAC, the  Canadian government has accorded the advocates of male-dominated aboriginal self-  governments a preferred position."  GaU Stacey-Moore, a Mohawk from Kahnawake also named in NWAC's suit says  "The Court found NWAC has justification  to complain that its constitutional right to  freedom of expression was infringed when  Canada chose to fund only male-dominated  organizations. [They] found that no aboriginal group in the constitutional process represents the constituents of NWAC."  The four Native groups—the Native  CouncU of Canada, the Assembly of First  Nations, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and  the Metis National CouncU—have claimed  they represent women as weU as men in  constitutional negotiations with the government. They have received 95 percent of $10  miUion in government funding to enable Native participation in the constitutional process.  On the issue of funding, the court found,  according to NWAC, that by providing less  than five percent to NWAC, the government  denied aboriginal women individuaUy and  coUectively their right to freedom of expression. By deciding to fund one Native group  over another, the federal government had  "taken action which has had the effect of restricting the [rights] of Aboriginal women in  a manner offensive" to sections of the Charter guaranteeing freedom of speech and sex  equahty rights.  This appears to reject the argument put  forward by the government that there were  not enough monies to go around. Funding to women's groups continue to channel  through the four chosen Native groups.  Stacey-Moore said she was hopeful the  decision would be useful in securing future  funding. "On the question of remedy... the  court ruled that NWAC's funding request  be dealt with in negotiations with [Cabinet]. In that process, Canada was asked to  be cognizant of the need to accord equahty  to Aboriginal women," said Stacey-Moore.  However, in joint press statement on August 25, Stacey-Moore and Mclvor say they  are dissatisfied with the court's finding that  "suggests we have no right to now participate in First Ministers' conferences because  it is part of the legislative process." The  statement, issued on August 25, came after NWAC's conference on the constitution  with the National Action Committee of the  Status of Women in Ottawa.  The federal appeal court ruled against  ordering the government to give NWAC a  In response to the lack of trust in the  Panel's process, NAC is considering initiating a national campaign making ending violence against women a top priority.  Ten days prior to the release of the  Panel's report, Health and Welfare and  Statistics Canada announced a $1.9 nul-  Uon national telephone survey on famUy violence targeting 20,000 Canadian women.  The six-month survey, to begin in January,  wUl look again at the extent and nature of  the problem of violence against women.  Women are incensed about the tossing  away of more money on yet another study  on violence against women. NAC's Thobani  says this "continuation of the debate of how  endemic the problem of violence against  women is is an obstacle to creating strategies for ending violence."  "It's time that the statistics gathered by  women in transition houses and rape crisis  centres be beheved," adds Thobani.  The survey wiU only be accessible to  women who speak EngUsh or French and  wUl not reach women without access to  a telephone, who are hearing impaired, or  who have difficulty staying on the phone for  extended periods of time.  As weU, only two questions of the 259-  question survey refer to women with disabU-  ities, says Masuda.  MeanwhUe, the Panel says it wUl issue  a National Action Plan on violence against  women at the end of its 15-month mandate  in December. Given the Panel's disregard  for the demand for more accurate representation of women of colour and women with  disabihties, women's groups do not expect  the final report to have any substantive recommendations toward ending violence.  "If the representation on the Panel does  not reflect our experiences, then the National Action Plan won't reflect solutions  to meet our needs," says Eunadie Johnson,  president of NOIVM.  Agnes Huang is a regular writer for  Kinesis.  seat at the constitutional table because "the  courts wiU not meddle [and] dictate to [g(  ernment] who they ought to invite to their  table." They pointed out that agreements  on inherent self-government were already in  process—the court ruhng came on the same  day Ottawa and the premiers reached an interim agreement on self-government.  The court, however, ordered the federal government to pay court costs, including those of the lower court. Shortly after  NWAC's first court chaUenge was launched  in March, the government cancelled the  Court ChaUenges Program under which  they received initial funding to start the  case.  NWAC has issued a chaUenge to the government to invite NWAC to the upcoming  First Ministers' conference. H the ruhng by  the court of appeal does not lead to a seat  for NWAC at constitutional talks, NWAC  says it intends to take its appeal to the  Supreme Court of Canada and, failing that,  to the United Nations Committee on Human Rights.  Miche Hill and Fatima Jaffer are regular writers for Kinesis.  KINESIS sssasss^sssss^^  NEWS  Women and the law:  The right to bear breasts  by Christiana Wiens  What's the big deal about baring our  breasts? Everyone's talking about whether  we should, whether we shouldn't, why we  should, why we shouldn't... so we thought  we'd talk to women who work daily with  issues such as violence against women,  pornography and sexual harassment to see  what they thought of the whole thing.  Central to the issue, it seems, are the  basic principles of control and choice. For  women, taking control of our bodies and reclaiming the right to bare our breasts are  important steps in the struggle to take back  ownership of our bodies.  Scuieg, the organizer of a recent three-  day, bare-breasted demonstration in Vancouver this summer, says women who go  topless are opening doors on bigger issues  by working to demystify women's breasts.  She says topless women confront the issue of  sexualization of women on the street head  on.  Squieg, sees this action as a lead-in for  feminist, pohtical debate rather than detrimental to the women's movement. "AU of  our oppression stems from the same thing,"  says Scuieg, "and my hberating acts do not  hold others back but move us forward on  another front."  Fighting for the right to bare our breasts  in pubUc is part of combatting gender  discrimination and sexual assault, agrees  Theresa Lemieux of Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW). The issues have to be discussed together even if  the reaUty of sexual assault demands more  immediate attention.  Lemieux says WAVAW supports a woman's individual decisions and recognizes  the right to bare breasts as an obvious issue  of sexual discrimination, but cautions that  going topless may not be safe for aU women.  "Because we Uve in a generaUy unsafe  time, women should choose when and where  it is safe to take off their shirts and they  should be aware of possible harassment,"  says Lemieux.  However, Lemieux says this should not  be misconstrued as support for those who  claim it is pointless to fight for equal torso  baring because we hve in a sexist society.  "Such thinking perpetuates the myth that  [the sight of] our bodies wUl provoke men  into an uncontroUable lust," says Theresa.  Johanna Pilot of the Vancouver Status  of Women agrees, saying that the system  blames women for assault when the central  issue is the lack of control women have over  their bodies. "Women are often blamed for  'inciting' attacks on their bodies. I think the  issue is more one of who 'owns' our breasts.  The law dictates whether I can take off my  shirt on a hot day but it's perfectly legal for  anyone to show bare breasts in a TV commercial. That's scary."  Says Lemieux: "Since women's breasts  have been sexuaUzed for men, and because  they are a focus of the mainstream media,  they have become a commodity. If breasts  became desexualized, and were depicted in  the media as natural, the pornography industry would clearly lose money."  The impact that pornography has on attitudes towards our breasts must be recognized, says Lemieux. While women claim  their bodily rights in Canada, many men  stand in stores peering at nude women  in glossy magazines and in pornographic  videos.  Desexuahzing breasts decreases the ability of the porn industry to propagate images  of exploited women as immoral or erotic, she  says.  Zara Suleman of WAVAW says that whUe  fighting for control over our bodies in this  way is important, we must keep in mind  women who experience language, economical, or racial barriers. They are less safe in  speaking out on such issues because of a fear  of losing support from their community, she  points out.  Suleman says she beheves the issue of  gender discrimination should be kept in perspective and notes that it is women with  the most power who are often the ones most  able to speak out about such issues.  It is, however, clearly an issue that some  women wUl continue to address. Already,  women are claiming their right to go topless at 'top optional' places on Commercial  Drive in Vancouver and at other locations  across the country. Arrests made in Waterloo this summer wUl offer new challenges  to the criminal code and promise to keep  this heated debate going at least untU the  weather cools off.

KINESIS Poor people speak:  Waste  of a nation  by Kelly O'Brien  "No more thinking that donating to food  banks is the answer and no more blaming  poor people for our situation," says Rose  Brown, one of the panehsts at a news conference organized by End Legislated Poverty  (ELP).  The conference, held at Heritage HaU on  August 12, looked at results of a recent ELP  survey on poor people's feeUngs towards  charities in Vancouver. The report, "Waste  of a Nation," documents over one hundred  responses compiled from discussion groups  and interviews with people from Carnegie  Centre, Downtown Eastside Women's Centre, missions, soup kitchens and food banks.  In the report, poor people speak "specificaUy about the kind of poverty that makes  it necessary for them to seek assistance from  charity," says Wayne MacEachern of ELP.  The responses vary, but most of the participants agree that, while charities are necessary for their economic survival, they prefer not to use them because of the humUia-  tion they experience as charity users. "Lining up (at food banks) destroys my dignity, my self-esteem and wastes my time,"  Low welfare rates, low wages and deductions from maintenance payments from  ex-partners explain why so many women  are economically underprivUeged and dependent on charities, says panelist Jennifer  Pagan, a single mother with four chUdren,  speaking on behalf of women at the CoUing-  wood food bank.  Welfare rates are currently 41 to 50 percent below the poverty hne, women make  about 62 cents to the male doUar, and  family-support payments from ex-partners  exceeding $200 are deducted from monthly  welfare cheques for women with chUdren.  In fact, about 65 percent of female single-  parent households in BC are poor. Canadian women, 59 percent of whom hve on low  incomes, have few alternatives.  What is encouraging, however, is the  number of people, especially women, that  are at the front hnes of the anti-poverty  movement, says Ann Mclvor, a researcher  for "Waste of a Nation." "[Women] are the  ones that are pushing for change the most,  the ones that committed [themselves to the  project] through the greatest part of the  summer and called us and got involved,"  says Mclvor.  "Lining up (at food banks) destroys my dignity,  my self-esteem and wastes my time."  - Antoinette Nafar  says one paneUst, Antoinette Nafar, a single mother with three chUdren.  The report is not suggesting that charity should be eliminated. Rather, it identifies charity as a band-aid solution—a symptom of a classist system rooted in economic  inequality. "Charity is just one way our society reinforces economic inequality," says  paneUst Rose Brown of ELP.  It is unjust because people are not adequately funded "by government, Brown says.  "People act on good wUl and donate to charities but stiU the problems of homelessness  and hunger and poverty keep growing."  Single mothers in the report drew  a connection between gender and class  among other overlapping forms of oppression women hving in poverty face. "The fact  that we don't have any choices is [because],  number one, we're women," says one woman  from the CoUingwood Food Bank in the report. "We make substantiaUy less than men.  The fact that we're single women, that's another strike against us—and that we have  chUdren."  ELP researcher Karen Hobbes thinks  feminism has a lot to do with the positive  response they received from women. It has  played a major role in getting women to  look at their situation, who they are, and  do something about it.  "Even 20 years ago, you wouldn't see single women speak out at a panel [on poverty]  and reaUy identify themselves. If you grew  up poor, speaking out is something that is  hard to do. Women on this panel just put  themselves right on the hne," says Hobbes.  In the report, ELP largely holds corporate lobby groups Uke the Fraser Institute  and the Business CouncU on National Issues  responsible for the increase in the number  of people who use charities. Their conservative agenda has had serious repercussions,  the report concludes.  ELP also sees government pohcies such  as the foUowing responsible for making Ufe  tougher for poor people:  See ELP page 6  E  ii  Violence against women:  Copping  out on  protection  by Mijin Kim  Women called for an end to pohce inaction in the prevention of violence against  women at a raUy before Vancouver's law  courts on August 14. The raUy brought together about 30 women, many of them representatives from Lower Mainland women's  groups.  An organizer of the raUy cited the recent  slaying of Alexandra Pesic of Coquitlam as a  tragic example of pohce inaction. "But this  is not just about her," said Chris Rahim of  the Vancouver Status of Women. "Women  hve in fear of men daily. We are threatened,  assaulted, raped and stalked—yet the law  faUs to protect us adequately."  Pesic filed over ten complaints in the two  years prior to her murder regarding numerous incidents of assault and harassment. She  was shot in her car after work on August  5. Her former mother-in-law and two hired  assassins are being charged withfirst degree  murder. Her former husband and father-in-  law werealso taken into custody but released  the next day with no charges laid.  "It seems the only way to get the poUce to take action is to be murdered," said  one speaker at the raUy, Seema Ahluwaha  of SAWAN (South Asian Women's Action  Network). Over one month this summer,  four Montreal women were murdered by ex-  partners, according to poUce files. In 1988,  97 women in Canada died as a result of domestic violence.  Regina Louvek of Vancouver Rape ReUef  and Women's Shelter blamed "police compliance [and] the legal system's sanction"  for perpetuating violence against women.  She said Pesic's murder is one of many and  that "women are kUled by husbands, lovers  and male acquaintances more often than by  strangers."  AhluwaUa spoke of "the double-bind that  women of colour are in because of racism  and sexism" when reporting crimes of domestic violence to the pohce. "At the same  time they consider how best to protect  themselves from violence meted out to them  at home, they must consider the effects of  drawing pohce attention to their comrm  ties," she said.  She said, "pohce have often used calls in  reference to domestic violence as a springboard for immigration or housing checks."  Laws and funds are also used for the identification of prostitutes and not for their  protection, said Karin Mladovic of Prostitutes and Other Women for Equal Rights.  That means, "the fact that she is a prosti  tute makes her disposable, as far as the pohce are concerned," she said.  Pohce say they are unable to react to  women's concerns untU they are actuaUy  physicaUy harmed. They say threats against  women and reports of women's fears are not  substantial enough to warrant pohce protection.  AU of the speakers at the raUy said  women's groups wUl continue to advocate  for laws to better protect women before violence occurs. As Louvek said in her speech,  "the system hasfaUed Alexandra Pesic, it  has faUed other women and wUlcontinuefaU-  ing other women ... and this has got to  change."

KINESIS  Sept. 92 ssssssssvs^ssss  WHAT'S   NEWS?  by Harriet Fancott  Irish ban  on abortion  info  The Dublin Abortion Information Campaign (DAIC) says it wUl continue to defy  an Irish High Court injunction banning the  pubhcation and distribution of abortion information despite the court's decision to uphold the ban in a ruhng early in August.  The ban was originaUy introduced in  1989 when an anti-choice group, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn ChUd  (SPUC), took student leaders to court for  publishing information on abortion clinics  and services in their Student Handbooks.  Elizabeth O'Shea of DAIC condemned  the Irish High Court for their stance, saying  DAIC has ^qo respect for, or obedience to a  law that denies women's basic human rights  such as the right to control her own fertUity.  By denying Irish women this right, the judiciary has yet again shown its willingness  to classify women as second class citizens."  In the wake of the injunction, there is  fear of further censorship of women's pubUcations. Eariier this year, women's health  books including Our Bodies Ourselves  were removed from Ubrary shelves because  they contained information on abortion.  DAIC is also calling for a referendum to  repeal the 1983 pro-Ufe amendment of the  Irish Constitution inserted in 1983. "Opinion polls show that 80 percent of the country  now favours the avaUabUity of abortion in  Umited circumstances. It is time to remove  this amendment from our constitution, and  we caU on the government to hold a referendum on repealing the (pro-Ufe) Eighth  Amendment in November, rather than a referendum on whether or not a woman has  the right to abortion information and the  right to travel."

Score one  for lesbians  Lesbians and gays scored a big one on  August 6 when an Ontario Appeals Court  declared Canada's Human Rights Act unconstitutional because it does not protect  against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The decision upholds a lower court ruling made last September that found the  Act discriminated against lesbians and gays  because it did not outlaw discrimination  against sexual orientation and is a loss for  the federal justice department which was  appealing the 1991 decision.  ELP from page 5  • a cap on the Canada Assistance Plan has  made it more difficult for provindal governments to pay welfare rates  • cuts to the Unemployment Insurance program have created increased poverty for  over 400,000 people and their families  • the free trade agreement has helped destroy over half a miUion jobs and has lowered wages  • the GST transfers the burden of paying  four bUUon dollars in taxes from corporations to individuals  The report's short term recommendations include improving the quahty of food  at charities, training food bank workers to  treat charity users more respectfuUy, and  encouraging charity organizers to address  the underlying causes of poverty in order to  work towards long term change.  The report calls on government to increase welfare rates and raise the minimum  wage to $9.05 an hour, as weU as to implement fair taxation, affordable housing, rent  controls and maintenance payments without deductions. Other long term recommendations include annulling the free trade  agreement.  Only one elected pohtician, MLA Margaret Lorde from Comox, and two candidates—NDP's Betty Baxter for the Vancouver Centre riding, and COPE's Mel Leham  for the City's bi-election—showed up for the  news conference, which left some wondering  where poverty issues he on the NDP government's hst of priorities.

It is a decision that could have far-  reaching impUcations in the battle for lesbian and gay rights in Canada. It could allow lesbians and gays to fight more easUy  for spousal benefits straight people enjoy—  from pension plans and health benefits to  bereavement leave and immigration sponsorship.  Says one lawyer specializing in gay rights  cases, "What the courts are saying to Kim  CampbeU is this: 'If you aren't going to  change the Canadian Human Rights Act to  include sexual orientation, we are'."  As Kinesis goes to press, the federal justice department says it is not sure whether  it wUl be appealing the court's decision for  a second time.  But "for Kim CampbeU to even consider  appealing the Ontario Court of Appeal ruling in the Haig and Birch case exposes her  active campaign against equal rights for lesbians and gay men," says NDP candidate  for Vancouver Centre, Betty Baxter in a recent letter in The Vancouver Sun.  This summer, Justice Minister Kim  CampbeU reneged once again on her  promise to lesbians and gays to amend the  act after strong opposition from conservative MPs within the tory caucus [see Kinesis, July/Aug. 92].  COPE-ing  with an  election  Women voting in the Vancouver City  CouncU by-election may have any easier  time selecting a candidate than usual—  long-time community activist and COPE  candidate Mel Lehan has put sexism, anti-  racism and homophobia high on his Ust of  priorities for issues to tackle in CouncU.  The by-election, set for September 19, is  being held because COPE counciUor Bruce  York was forced to resign due to UI health.  Lehan says he is "committed to uniting and empowering communities" and is  appeaUng to the lesbian community for  support. He participated in the recent  Stonewall Festival and Gay Pride Parade in  Vancouver because, says Lehan "it is imperative our elected officials recognize and respond to the needs of the city's diverse communities."  Former co-campaign manager in Betty  Baxter's recent successful bid for NDP nomination in the Federal riding of Vancouver  Centre, Lehan has a long history of community involvement, including sitting on the  board for Reach Medical-Dental Chnic and  End Legislated Poverty.  BC's health  care reform  by Claudia Martin  The NDP government is pushing ahead  with a redesign of BC's health care system,  but it's unclear where women fit into the  picture.  At a recent 'stakeholder's conference'  caUed by the ministry of health, about 100  health care workers and representatives of  concerned groups met with government representatives to look at the chaUenges and  opportunities a reform could offer. Missing from the the guest Ust were members  of the pubhc—health care consumers—who  did not appear to fit the 'stakeholder' bill.  Participants included representatives from  groups such as the Midwives Association of  BC, Vancouver Women's Health CoUective,  Persons With Aids Society and Vancouver  Native Health Society, Also present were  union delegates, deputy ministers, massage  therapists, dental hygienists, nurses and  physicians.  Proposals for reform focused on moving towards a more community- oriented  health care system and forging interminis-  terial links. However, a representative from  the VWHC said the discussion stopped  short of talking about systemic barriers to  change.  Raine McKay of the VWHC said, "There  is a real concern that we may just have  the same system [but] at a local level [after  the reform]." And those systemic barriers  within the health care bureaucracy could be  used to prevent women from participating  in the reform.  "The most important thing women can  do now," said Raine McKay, "is not to look  at the changes to the structure, but at the  process with which the structure is implemented."  Most of the ministry of health's proposals  addressing changes to the system were tied  recommendations made by the BC royal  commission report on health care and costs  released last November. The report, "Closer  to Home," also known as the Seaton Report, makes some 367 recommendations on  cutting costs and improving health care.  While some sections refer generaUy to special needs—chUdren and youth, women, the  aging, immigrants, Natives, and people with  disabihties—none go in depth into these areas. Health care needs of women are not focused on in any one chapter.  The ministry has said it wUl continue to  consult with community groups in order to  prepare an official response to the Seaton  report early this faU.  Claudia Martin, a first time writer  for Kinesis, has worked in the Health  Care system for five years.  r-  ~~T  EASTside DataGrapIu'cs  1460 CoMMERciAl Drive  teI: 255-9559 Fax: 255-5075  15% OFF  office or art supplies  with this coupon  expiry date: October 30.1992  CaU or fAx foR Free NEXT'dAy delivERy!  ^  KINESIS NEWS  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  BC and pay equity:  Small step on a long road  by Kinesis Writer  A first step towards long-awaited pay equity legislation in BC was announced by the  NDP government early in August. A committee composed of 23 British Columbians, primarily women, has been appointed to help develop new pubUc sector pay equity legislation  for the province.  The announcement was made by minister of women's equahty, Penny Priddy.  "These people were selected for their experience and expertise in labour and women's issues by organizations who wiU be most affected by pay equity legislation—women's groups,  pubUc sector unions and pubUc sector employers," says Priddy.  The committee wUl be looking at developing "a real alternative to the existing  complaints-based and process-oriented models ... which focuses on results, respects the  expertise of workplace partners and has a long-term focus," she said.  Committee members wUl be responsible for reviewing and critiqueing working papers  on pay equity legislation, recommending improved or alternate approaches and suggesting  the kind of assistance government should provide to groups implementing the legislation.  Aimed at narrowing the wage gap between women and men, " Priddy also says the "legislation wiU help make sure that jobs traditionaUy labeUed 'women's work' are paid as well  as those labeUed 'men's work'."  Representatives from provincial women's groups included in the committee members  are Kathryn Wahamaa of BC and Yukon Association of Women's Centres (BCNY), Greta  Smith of the BC/Yukon Society of Transition Houses, Orla Cousineau and Val Cochrane of  Leaf and Linda Sperhng, Anne Harvey, Marilyn Coleman and Kaye Sinclair from Women  for Better Wages.  Labour groups representatives include Mary Rowles of BC Federation of Labour [see  story below], Heather Keeley from the British Columbia Nurses Union, Carol Cameron  from the Canadian Union of Pubhc Employees and Pam Bush from the Health Sciences  Association.  The minister promised to move ahead as quickly as possible with the legislation.  A cure for chronic imbalance?  by Janet Lucas  Is pay equity legislation the remedy for  chronic wage discrimination against women  in BC or a panacea that wiU create an incomprehensible and inflexible bureaucratic  process?  This was a key question raised by the  Trade Union Research Bureau's discussion  paper, "On Pay Equity Legislation in BC."  The paper was the focus of a forum at  Vancouver's Maritime Labour Centre ear-  Uer this summer. Debating issues raised by  it were Mary Rowles of the BC Federation  of Labour (BCFL), Linda Marcott of End  Legislative Poverty (ELP), Carolyne Askew  of Labour Lawyers and Others (LLO), and  concerned members of the pubUc.  The paper notes that, over the past 10  years, the gap between woman's and men's  wages in BC has been virtuaUy static. The  wage gap in BC is the widest in Canada—in  1988, the average woman's wage was barely  62 percent of the average male wage. The  report then goes on to look at the limitations of existing pay equity legislation and  offers detaUed proposals for an effective pay  equity program in BC.  Panelists raised concerns about looking  at existing pay equity legislation as 'the  solution' rather than, as Rowles of BCFL  put it, only part of the change needed to  achieve women's economic equity and independence. The paper proposes a pay equity program that looks at getting money  to women as quickly and efficiently as possible. This requires measures such as raising the minimum wage, increasing the scope  and power of unions within the economy,  and implementing affirmative action and  employment equity programs.  Askew of LLO said that women need to  establish "what kind of process they [government] wUl employ, who is consulted, how  extensively people are consulted and for  whom the legislation is written."  She added, she is concerned women "wiU  lose control of the issue through legislation  [and] it is our issue." Also, in order for legislation to be useful and accessible to women,  it must "be written in ordinary working  women's language."  Existing legislation is ineffective for many  reasons, including lengthy time frames and  an over-reliance on job evaluation. Implementation tends to be stretched out, suggesting no further action is necessary untU  the final impact is known years down the  road.  Forum speakers supported the paper's  recommendation for a 'phased in' approach,  where one third of the wage gap must be  closed within three years of pay equity legislation, and total pay equity is achieved  within nine years. Once the nine year period  has elapsed, pay equity becomes mandatory,  the paper states.  ELP's Marcott reminded the audience  that the minister of labour, Moe Sihota,  promised increases in the minimum wage  level by 50 cents every six months, and to  125 percent of the poverty hne in four years.  She invited aU participants attending the forum to sign a petition to demand that the  Minister of Labour raise minimum wage, as  promised.  The power of coUective bargaining, said  Rowles, should not be underestimated. Organized women are in a better position to  make gains since their unions can negotiate  the plan to be used and provide protection  from reprisals and harassment.  cess which could take 12 months, 18 months,  or even two years, causing the woman to experience loss of self esteem and incentive,  weU as frustration." Further, penalties for  non-comphance with pay equity legislation  must be stiff. The fine an employer is forced  to pay wiU determine how mandatory the  program is in practice.  OveraU, panehsts agreed that, for pay  equity legislation to succeed in BC, it  must be understandable, implementable.  monitorable, avoid limiting future advancements, and be securely entrenched so it cannot be overridden or ignored. Most impor-  Rowles suggested  that minimum wage levels  be raised as the easiest,  most direct way  to get more money into  these women's pockets.  Askew cautioned against pay equity legislation that defines a job's 'value' as a hst of  component parts and ignores broader questions of what 'value' is. She said this approach ignores historical factors contributing to inequitable wage levels—job evaluators often regard women's skiUs as quaUties  intrinsic to their 'womanness' rather than  as job-related ones.  Rowles suggested minimum wage levels  be increased as the easiest, most direct way  to get more money into these women's pockets. Almost 80 percent of minimum-wage  earners in BC are women. Accordingly, the  paper calls for an immediate increase in the  minimum wage to 60 percent of the average  industrial wage.  Rowles pointed out that raising wage  floors would also have a freezing effect on  further privatization, since the majority of  savings in privatization are from dramatically reduced labour costs.  And whUe Rowles says a wage gap between unionized men and women exists,  "even the [preceding] Social Credit government had to admit that wages wUl sometimes double or triple what they might have  been in the same sector if [it were] not  unionized."  However, with only 34 percent of working women in unions, she added, it is important "to increase the number of women  in unions and the scope and power of unions  within the economy."  And to deal with complaints and non-  compUance, the paper calls for the creation  of a Pay Equity Commission or Tribunal.  Askew made a point of stressing the seriousness entaUed in the creation of a regulatory body and selection of tribunal officers.  "They must have the right point of view,"  she says. Women should not have to "stand  up front and centre and go through a pro-  tantly, it must target women most in need  of money, immigrant and Native women,  women of colour, and women who work in  smaU unionized firms.  Both the discussion paper and the speakers at the forum seemed to acknowledge  the discrepancy that can exist between the  stated intent of legislation and its actual impact, and the importance of being vigUant of  government action. Says Askew: " a tremendous amount of energy and effort goes into  making the legislation work ... there must  be a commitment from government to monitor the effectiveness of legislation ... making sure the legislation accomplishes the social pohcy goal".

The first ALN conference was  held in Bangkok in 1990. The four-  day conference in May brought together  160 Asian lesbians from 13 countries.  Two of the Asian women from Vancouver who attended the ALN conference, Cat Renay and Margaret Matsuyama got together with Chris Rahim  to talk about the conference in August.  Margaret Matsuyama is a Nisei (second  generation Japanese-Canadian) lesbian  and a woman warrior. Cat Renay does  not categorize herself. Chris Rahim is a  member of Asian Lesbians of Vancouver (ALOV).  Chris Rahim: Why was the second ALN  conference held?  Cat Renay: The primary aim of this  conference was to give Asian lesbians a  chance to network, organize, and share experiences with each other.  Chris: And who attended the conference?  Cat: There were women from Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Peru, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, and the  US.  Margaret Matsuyama: They were of  East Asian, South East Asian and South  Asian descent. Most of the women attending the conference were Japanese.  Cat: There were also women of mixed  heritage.  Chris: Why did you want to go to the  conference?  Cat: It's only been about two and a half  years since I said, 'yes, okay, I am Asian.'  Since I was eight, I never acknowledged I  was Asian. I grew up totally white and I  didn't have any Asian friends ... In a way  I wanted to push myself and go to a place  where there were almost all Asian people,  where everyone had black hair and spoke  another language. Plus, I wanted to know  more about being Asian because I didn't  know much about it.  Chris: So you had expectations?  Cat: Maybe just for myself. I was doing  something for me that was going to make  me stronger, hopefully.  Chris: And did it?  Cat: I think so. I survived.  Chris: Margaret, was this your first time  going to Japan?  Margaret: No. I've been there a few  times before. This time I went with my mom  and grandmother because we were going to  attend my brother's wedding in Japan.  Chris: Was this trip different for you  from the other ones?  Margaret: As [with] my previous trips  there, it was an emotional trip with a lot of  different issues coming up for me.  Chris: What were some of those issues?  Margaret: Feehng like a foreigner and  not feehng Uke one at the same time.  Racism, that is, the effect of North American colonialism on language (not being  able to speak fluently in Japanese) homophobia, and lack of understanding of what  Japanese- Canadian means.  Chris: What were some of the issues  talked about during the conference work-  Cat.: There were workshops on Asian lesbian writing, on being a multicultural Asian  lesbian, sexual abuse, lesbians in pain, lesbians in Thailand, language and power,  coming-out stories, and the impact of white  lesbian feminist theories on lesbianism in  the Asian lesbian community. There was  also a great shde show.  Margaret: There was also some discussion about how to report the conference in  a safe way so it wouldn't endanger women  who weren't out to their families or communities. Even the conference itself was held  under a different name.  Cat: And we couldn't use the word 'lesbian' in front of the hotel personnel—but we  could use the word 'dyke'. That was okay.  Chris: Because heterosexual people did  not know what the word 'dyke' meant?  Chris: What were some of the firsts you  did?  Cat: Well, the biggest thing I accomplished was speaking in public. I usually  can't do it, so being forced to do it was incredible. I felt so good after that.  Chris: Did it make a difference having  Asian lesbians in the audience?  Cat: I think so. Part of what I'm coming  to realize is that with other Asian women I  don't have to try as hard. I feel more relaxed  with Asian women. I would never have been  able to do that in Vancouver. Even though I  knew some of the women at the conference,  I did it. It made me realize a lot of things  about being Asian too.  Chris: And what were some of the valuable things for you, Margaret?  Cat Renay speaking at the  1992 Asian Lesbian Conference  Cat: Yes.  Chris: Were there any workshops dealing with South Asian women?  Cat: Only a few. There weren't many  South Asian lesbians at the ALN conference.  Chris: How do you feel about the lack  of South Asian representation? As they are  Asians too, you'd expect there to be a larger  representation of South Asian lesbians.  Margaret: I totally agree. The conference was pretty well dominated by Japanese  women since it was in Japan.  Chris: Was there a large group of Asian  lesbians from North America?  Cat: No, I actually thought Europe  and North America would have been more  strongly represented, but they weren't.  Chris: What sort of experience was the  trip to Japan and the conference for you,  Cat?  Cat: Going to this 'exotic' place with all  these women who have black hair is quite a  mind blower. It really made me think about  a lot of things. I was always scared of being  identified as an Asian woman. I met a lot of  people. I did a lot of firsts over there. The  conference was so intense. There were always new people and new things to discover  that I never knew about or cared about.  "...a different  perspective, one  which enabled me  to connect my  lesbianism with  being Japanese."  -Margaret  Matsuyama  i  |j       Margaret: Meeting, seeing, and being a  ■S   part of a Japanese lesbian community in  |>  Japan. Part of my experience growing up in  =   Canada is that because of racism and ho-  ■£    mophobia, I have constantly struggled with  o   feeling hke I have to choose between my cul-  °-   ture and my sexuahty. Being at the conference and seeing a herstory of Japanese lesbianism gave me a different perspective, one  which enables me to connect my lesbianism  with being Japanese.  Chris: Were you able to connect with a  lot of other women?  Margaret: Not really, I didn't have  enough time to because I was unable to attend most of the conference.  Cat: I connected with some Asian women  from Sweden and Australia, They were part  of the networking group I went to called  ALOA—Asians Living Outside Asia. We  want to produce newsletters throughout the  year, so well keep in touch and let each  other know what's going on.  Chris: What were some of the highlights  for you Margaret?  Margaret: Taking Ofuro (a public bath)  among Asian lesbians. I have a lot of memories in Japan connected with taking Ofuro.  This experience for me really felt hke two  worlds coming together.  Chris: I understand that the conference  took place alongside another conference.  Cat: That was the Lesbians Affirming  Lesbians in Asia (LALA) conference. About  eighty women attended that conference. It  was open to white women and women of  colour, but most of the participants were  white.  Chris: Were joint workshops available  for participants of both conferences?  Cat: Well, they had a workshop on bicul-  tural couples which was open to both conferences. Some of the videos, taiko drumming, and dance were open to everyone.  Chris: Why were the two conferences  held together?  Cat: Because the center where the conference was held and where we stayed is  used by both women and men, so holding  the two conferences together reduced the  number of men on the premises. And also,  the LALA participants donated the regis \  tration fees they collected to the ALN con  ference.  Chris: How did you feel about white les  bians being in the same space as the ALN  conference?  Cat: I didn't get bothered by it that  much just because it has only been a cou  pie of years since I began to identify my  self as an Asian woman. A lot of my friends I  are white. Half of the contacts I made were|  with white women from the LALA conference. I hung out with them a lot just because I could actually speak with them.  Margaret: It bothered me that they werel  there. There were actually a few ALN work  shops open to them. And a lot of the conference areas were shared by all of us. To me  having an Asian-only space is extremely important. And it was extremely discouraging  to go to Japan and still have to deal withj  white people's racism.  I recognize there maybe is a need fori  Asian lesbians in Asia to form coalitions J  with white lesbians—I just didn't feel it  was necessary at this conference. There was|  some discussion about whether future ALN  conferences should be held with LALA. l|  think the decision was that the host countries will decide.  Chris: Did you experience any problems  with the ALN conference?  Cat: I tended to get impatient with  the translations. They would translate into  Japanese or Enghsh. After every two sentences, you had to stop for someone to  translate. It really breaks up what you want  to say—you can't get across everything you  want to say because it gets too scattered  My mind wandered a lot.  Margaret: In general, I thought the conference was very well organized. However  because it was in Japan, I think there werel  a lot of financial limits for a lot of women  This was addressed by the conference organizers in their provision of free meals and  subsidies.  Chris: Was that a problem for either of|  you?  Cat: Money was a problem for me, butl  I went to the conference as a representative  of a group called ALOV-Asian Lesbians of]  Vancouver. We held an auction in April to  raise money for my trip. We also sponsored  a woman hving in Asia to attend the ALNJ  conference. Still, we had to borrow more  money from a private individual to do that  Chris: Is there talk about another conference?  Cat: They're planning the third one in  Taiwan in 1994. They say to look out for  more information.  ALOV is planning another fundraiser^  for the fall. Watch for details.

This metaphor struck me hard, describing perfectly my reality since being rejected  by the mental health system—disbelief at  being kicked out for non-compliance with  'the program' and being stuck with a drug  dependency I didn't have before. I had to  begin tearing away the multilayered residue  of psychiatry's definitions of me and looking for a new support base.  This was battle, threatening my well being and exposing my vulnerability. I was  trapped in a maze of uncertainty. Writing  this down makes the sifting of what happened and the assigning of blame come easier.  It began when I moved to Vancouver. I  was poor, in pain and without family or  friends. When I was referred to a mental  health centre, I encountered treatment two-  pronged in approach. The community care  team offered me therapy with a psychiatric  nurse, and psychoactive drugs.  The drugs brought firsts into my Hfe—a  medical diagnosis for my grief and a prescription for elavil. Later, I read in Don  Weitz's Chemical Lobotomies that this  anti-depressant drug had been responsible  for 700 US deaths from 1976-77. At the  time, I never thought to say no or ask questions, and 'they' volunteered no information.  So I rushed to the pharmacy with that  stamped bit of paper, scribbled carelessly  with words, affirming at last that I was not  to blame for my depression. Four months  later, my 'therapeutic dose' was elavil 300  mgs, chlorpromazine 75, and restoril 30. Results of this chemical browbeating were multiple. Because the drugs stimulated my appetite yet slowed down my energy, I gained  about 80 pounds. People still scoff at larger  women—I became ashamed and reclusive.  My thought processes slowed and my  body sensations dulled. I couldn't read or  write and was only vaguely aware of pain  and pleasure. My dreams, often a colourful  reflection of my sense of humour, turned to  nightmares so horrible I began to beheve the  'mentally ill' label I had been given. In therapy, I fought a wordless fog, often running  out, devastated with my inability to connect. My once-photographic memory was  gone—I couldn't remember names, faces or  events important to me.  "Are you moving?" I was asked during  this time, as I gave away or destroyed all my  personal effects. I nodded, unaware I was  subconsciously acting out a suicide plan so  geared to success that my family was notified of my impending death.  To understand why I was such easy prey  to authority, it helps to know some of my  history. As a child, I was bashed about and  sexually abused by two family members. I  endured suffering, from prolonged imprisonment in a tiny dark attic to threats of rape  for being a lesbian.  Life was filled with endless ridicule, hes,  denial and shame, and a sense of being generally unwanted. I thought I was stupid,  not as good as my friends. My father's  name attached to mine made any effort I  might make seem futile—I even quashed  any thought that I might 'make it!'  Yet with each decrease  in the level  of medication,  my fixation  on suicide  went down  ■ not up.  By 1987, with all of this unresolved, how  could I possibly reject the gems offered by  these less frightening 'parents'—the mental  health system? It offered me compassion,  validation of sorts and 'time out' to ease off  on myself.  Eventually, I began to notice the recurring contradictions. They said: there is no  power hierarchy, that no idea I express  could cause them to reject me and no, I  wasn't being viewed as a 'broken' body and  soul beyond repair—their therapy was in  fact a means to an end.  However, their actions showed this wasn't  the true story. I was not beheved, nor was I  their equal. Psychiatrists had the power to  make decisions regarding my health and not  be held accountable for the risks they made  me take.  First, once on medication, there was  no follow-up—they awaited word from me.  They expected me to chart my progress,  though their drugs were robbing me of the  abihty to speak for myself or to feel and  think clearly. I did voice some concerns, but  they hstened selectively and parroted back  platitudes. For instance, my complaints of  numbness were labeUed 'avoidance' of feeling and seen as a protective maneuver I was  'choosing' to make.  My confusion grew when I noticed another contradiction. The doctor often told  me that getting off one drug 'cold turkey'  for a new one was dangerous. Yet, during  my five years in the system, I was often prescribed new drugs in this way—I was then  left to deal with withdrawal and drug rejection simultaneously. And each time, I'd  want to kill myself.  Looking back, I can see their labels became mine—I began to beheve I was seriously ill! I was equating all emotional highs  and lows with 'imbalance,' even those of my  usual PMS cycle.  What finally triggered my awareness that  I was being exploited by the system was  seeing how truly powerless I was within it.  When the mental health department 'outed'  me to the ministry of advanced education  without consulting me, I confronted them  but there was no apology. Their response  was to close my file without any warning.  I was denied further access to services. Financially, therapeutically, I was on my own.  But perhaps the most crazy-making of all  is how the rules took a strange twist. Suddenly, everything became my fault. J was  the one who gave my 'informed' consent and  it was / who had or hadn't followed orders.  An ambiguous, patronizing and inconsistent  mental health system let me down—but /  was the dysfunctional one.  Weitz in Chemical Lobotomies writes  that when an over-medicated patient commits suicide, the act is viewed as a symptom of their original diagnosis. Had I killed  myself when I was 27 years old, the last notation on my file would have been confirmation of 'chnical depression'.  Even as I tried to come to terms with all  this, I knew I didn't want to leave the community care team—that was all there was,  for me. This brought home just how much  my defeat was an issue of class.  To me, class privilege goes beyond economic advantage. It creates a psychological  edge—one that gears you for success in our  social and economic system. It is that intrinsic knowledge you have that you deserve  special attention. It means your needs, in a  society designed to accommodate your priv  ilege, tend to be accepted and met. Support,  both financial and emotional, is more readily available. Class means: you will get what  you want simply by virtue of who you are.  I learned early that I was wasn't good  enough. I felt small and powerless. I didn't  have much sense of self-esteem. I became  used to negative thinking and non-action.  This crippled me—I stayed stuck for a very  long time. While a part of me hoped things  might get better, I couldn't see the choices  that came my way—I rejected nothing for  fear nothing else would come along.  This was the case with the centre I was  at. While I did some healing there and saw  some excellent work, community care teams  are a service covered by the Medical Services Plan. They are designed as catchment  facilities, set up to net those with no other  options.  Because there were so many of us at these  centres, the tendency was to just dole out  drugs. The intention seems to be maintenance of day-to-day functioning as opposed  to actual improvement of the quality of our  hves. Too many of my Care Team peers became victims of this, falling into spaces so  vacant, it chills me to think of it.  The hideous prison I found myself in  at the centre became a noose around my  neck. My feehngs about the futility of fighting back were perpetuated by denying me  the one thing I needed—warmth and  derstanding. They gave me stability—with  drugs. HI hadn't questioned my treatment,  they would have kept me ensconced in that  void indefinitely.  Gradually, a number of events broke the  cycle: I met other women who were ex-  psychiatric patients. During the 'waking-  up' stages of my drug dependency, I began to see how the drug had blunted my  responses—when treated inconsiderately by  people, I wouldn't react. Yet with each decrease in the level of medication, my fixation on suicide went down—not up! I developed a desire to shake up my self-image, to  experience myself completely drug free.  Since February this year, much has  happened. With help from some wonderful friends, I enjoy a 125-mg decrease of  sinequan, my only drug. I'm still weeding  through psychiatry's effects on me and have  developed a mistrust of those to whom I'm  just another 'case.'  As for taking any prescriptions, I fight a  voice that tells me to comply. I deal with my  ignorance of medical matters by referring  to the it Compendium of Pharmaceuticals  and Specialties (CPS). Like many women, I  look for therapy I can afford and have found  nothing. I now know how the marketing of  therapy works. Not only does it discriminate against those with no money, it makes  us qualify friendships by implying all hstening that heals requires a fee.  Now, as I experience, once again, a more  rich emotional hfe, I often am scared. Then  I remember a question from a "Theatre-for-  the-Terrified" class I once took: "Would it  make you feel more alive to do this?" I am  not self-deceiving. I know hfe hurts as much  as it feels good. Yet my answer is still an  emphatic yes.  So I grit my teeth, continue my slow  wean, and make peace with intensity a httle while longer. It's paying off, too—I'm  making plans, taking risks with people I  care about and giggling myself silly sometimes. And often, in bed, while reflecting  on my day and looking forward eagerly to  my dreams, I'm so incredibly happy, I can't  even fall asleep.  KINESIS Ratna Roy: revealing a past  Reclaiming  devdasi  by Sunera Thobani  She was only four years old when she began training in the Kathak, Bharat Natyam  and Odissi schools of classical Indian dance forms. She is now an internationally acclaimed  dancer and has been a dear friend of mine for a number of years.  Before I met Ratna, I attended 'classical' dance performances, conscious each time I was  there that these were luxuries intended for the upper class. I was never comfortable at these  events. Then I saw Ratna dance and it had a profound impact on me. Not only does she  portray the reality of women's hves in a way that speaks to me, she does not shy away from  addressing issues of social justice, in particular those concerning the oppression of women.  Indeed, with innovative choreography and her commitment to portraying the multi-  faceted reality of women's hves, Ratna wins the respect of both art lovers and social activists wherever she performs. Her choreography of the dowry death dance is one of the  most powerful indictments of the dowry system I have seen represented in art form and  recalling her performance sends shivers down my spine even now.  I am learning from Ratna how the art form she has dedicated her hfe to was once developed by women in a matrihneal tradition and how, with the rise of patriarchal relations  and colonization, dance was taken out of women's hands. Ratna's commitment to reclaiming this tradition, and her insistence on portraying the power women have within themselves, has been a source of inspiration for me.  So when Ratna came to Vancouver last March for Tapestry—a weekend celebration by  and for women of colour and First Nations women—it was hardly surprising that her performance was one of the highlights of the weekend. At Tapestry, Ratna met some members of SAWAN, the South Asian Women's Action Network, a feminist collective based in  Vancouver. She promptly offered to perform at a fundraiser for SAWAN in September to  enable the collective to work towards one of its goals—establishing a South Asian women's  centre in Vancouver.  Originally from India, Ratna has hved in the United States since 1966. She currently  Uves in Washington State and teaches in the Expressive Arts Program at Evergreen State  CoUege. She goes back to India to work on dance every year.  What foUows is an interview with Ratna Roy. The format of the interview and structure  of this piece are very informal. Instead of foUowing the usual question-and-answer structure of interviewing, Ratna was more concerned that I should understand the information  she wished to share. I wrote up Ratna's thoughts as they were expressed to me in an informal style, and then incorporated any changes she wanted. There are a number of points  where Ratna instructed me to write down exactly what she was saying, and those appear  as direct quotes.  Ratna's first Odissi teacher was Guru Pankaj Charan Das. "He is the only guru who  comes from a devdasi family in Orissa. In other words, he comes from the temple-dance  tradition of women."  The mahari tradition in dance—the devdasi tradition in Orissa—is part of a matrihneal, Tantric tradition in India, and one of its central tenets is the worship of the Devi, the  "So when do they become defined as 'prostitutes?' WeU, they would caU it 'sacred prostitution.' But when patriarchal relations arose and marriage became important, that is  when these women's independence was a threat. The central issue was that she owned her  body—no man owned it!  "The word 'prostitution' needs to be defined because, if extra-marital sex is 'prostitution,' then they were 'prostitutes.' Otherwise each individual case has to be taken into account. Some women received jewels and so on, from males, without engaging in sexual relations with them. Others did engage in sexual relations."  Ratna then sketched a simplified history of the gradual erosion of the devdasi  tradition in Orissa.  During the muslim invasions of Orissa, the greater of which began around 1100 AD, invaders would loot and kidnap. The priests would then hide the deity of the temples and  the dancers would have no one to dance for—consequently, the Mahari dance went underground.  Around this time, the Gotipua dance—with boy-dancers—became the tradition. This  was sustained by Vaisnavism, believers in Sakhi Bhava, the tradition where human beings  are represented as female, whUe the God is male—hence, the person appeals to God as a  woman would to her male lover.  These beliefs were incorporated into the dance, where young men would dress as women  and perform the dance. These young men were called the Akhada Pila. It is noteworthy,  however, that the Gotipua tradition never performed in the inner sanctum of the Temple.  They would only perform dances in roving theatre parties, and the outer courtyards of the  temples.  By the early 20th Century, the dance had been totally debilitated. The rise of patriarchy and the colonization of India firmly took this tradition out of the hands of women.  The dance offended the sensibilities of the British who defined much of this dancing as  erotic. They deplored what they caUed the 'lascivious' movements of the dancers and their  moral Victorian hang ups about sensuality and sexuaUty became one more export to their  colonies.  It was only after independence from the British rule that the dance was graduaUy revived  by gurus. By this time a law, known as the Devdasi BUl, which attempted to suppress 'temple prostitution,' had been passed and women dancers had lost aU power. So most of the  gurus doing the reviving came from the Gotipua tradition (of boy-dancers). They revived  the dance by looking at ancient texts, temple structures, and by watching Uving dancers.  In the revival process, westernized people sat with the Gurus and decided what was  proper to put in the dance, explains Ratna. "[The Orissa tradition] is historicaUy a growing  tradition, but, in the revival process, it incorporated the moral codes of colonial (British)  rulers in the movements. The dance got colonized in this manner, along with western ideas  of what is 'proper' for a woman and what classical dance should be."  Many of the gurus restrained dancers from performing what they considered to be the  'erotic' movements. For example, certain Gurus did not aUow hip movement—the hips had  to be kept stiU while the torso moved, because movement of the hips was 'erotic,' and  therefore to be expunged.  "EssentiaUy, Odissi has become very significant, with weU-paid performances," says  Ratna. "But the money goes to the dancers who are male. Very Uttle of it goes to the  female dancers and the choreographers are the male gurus."  Her guru, Pankaj Charan Das differs not only in techniques but in the theme  of the dance. Ratna points out:  "My guru has women as the central characters, not men as the others did. His background is very important, because he grew up among women—that's aU he saw. He puts  women as central characters even in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, where Rama,  Krishna and Arjuna are not the main characters in his work, but Draupadi, Ahalya, Kunti,  Tara, and Mandodari are central characters. If you ask most people, they don't even know  who Ahalya and Tara are."  The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are the two classic Indian epics. The Ramayana  is based on the Uves of the legendary hero, Lord Rama, and his devoted wife, Sita. The  Mahabharata is based on the legendary war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas,  DailCe IS a llVin9 tradition ...it is essential that we redefine womanhood and depict it in this tradition..  and finally, it is important to acknowledge that sexuality is not a sin."  great goddess. This tantric tradition is female-centred and does not recognize the divisions  of caste. It celebrates sexuaUty as a form of realization of divinity, recognizing the spiritual  power of women as being stronger than that of men.  This goddess-worshipping tradition is much older than the patriarchal caste-based system of the Vedic Age, which was introduced by the Aryans in 1700 AD-500 BC. It is this  matriUneal tradition—the independence of women who have control over their bodies, their  sexuaUty, and their property, which is at the heart of Ratna's work. As she says, "The devdasi tradition is a tantric tradition, and aU my dances are in this tradition."  Devdasis have also been called 'prostitute-priestesses.' I asked Ratna to explain  how the devdasi tradition became synonymous with prostitution.  Devdasis were originaUy accompUshed, respected women. Around 2 AD, the Smriti writers of the sacred law clearly defined 'good women' as women that men would marry and  'other women' as those who had already had dealings with men but whom no men could  marry. Dancers were among these 'other women.' They were respected, their knowledge  and learning was recognized, their pohtical advice was sought, and their status was valued.  "The devdasis owned land, would learn to read and write, unhke other women, and their  funeral rites were carried out by their daughters. Their male chUdren had to work their  land in order to earn their keep, or do other kinds of work, because the land and property  belonged to their daughters.  Her guru, she said, is recognized as one of the foremost revivers of the dance. "But in  the [classical] tradition, my guru, Pankaj Charan Das was an embarrassment, as he was  the son of a devdasi and he had no legitimate father. My guru was exceptional because, in  his choreography, he defied this constraining of the dance by aUowing both hip and torso  movements. He put into dance what he was seeing, when others were taking the embarrassment of 'devdasi' out of the dance."  The revived form of the dance was also becoming 'Brahminized.' The Brahmins are the  priestly upper caste according to the Hindu caste system—the rise of patriarchy in India is historically tied to the rise of Vedic Age, with the Brahmins as the interpreters of  the ancient Aryan scriptures. Since devdasis were aU defined as 'prostitutes,' the Brahmin  women, who were participating in the re-defining of the form, 'sanitized' the revived form  in order to make it 'respectable' and 'classical.'  What was left of the devdasi tradition had become distorted and was called 'prostitute  dancing,' with many women dancers themselves unsure of what the pure form of the dance  was. Ratna says she can watch these dancers and "can tell which ones have been trained  in the classical form, which gestures are being used that had their basis in this classical  form, and so on."  Odissi has come to be recognized as a very sophisticated dance form, demanding  a subtlety which the other forms do not. Ratna explains.  with the Lord Krishna being born in the form of a man and siding with the Pandavas in  the struggle.  WhUe Ratna continues to perform classical dances from these epics, her work is distinctive for the centrality of the women she portrays. The woman character's experience  becomes the perspective from which the actions of other players in these epics are represented. The impact and consequences of the action is therefore seen in a different hght  than the patriarchal interpretation aUows for.  Ratna says it's important to her to continue the tradition of the dance in the old style  and that all her performances have female lead characters. "If I were in India within the  [Odissi] tradition, I would not have been accepted as a woman choreographer, especiaUy in  the Odissi tradition. It is very difficult to make a woman-statement and have it accepted.  Much of choreography has no idea of the complexity of being a woman."  Sometimes she breaks away even from the tradition of her guru. She recounts  the example of the choreography of Tara, one of the dances Ratna will be performing at the SAWAN benefit.  "I have made some choreographic changes where he would succumb to patriarchy and  I not. For example, in the Tara dance, Tara chaUenges Rama and Rama assures her that  she wUl not become a widow. She then bows down and accepts what he ordains. The most  powerful part of the choreography for me was the challenge of Tara, It was as if my guru's  heart and being was in that part of the choreography, yet it fizzles in the end where he  gives in to social control, which is Tara's acceptance of Rama's reassurance. What I have  done is to maintain her chaUenge of Rama and carried it in the choreography to the end.  So she never bows down to Rama."  Reclaiming the dance in the devdasi tradition is one of the most important issues facing  the dance today, says Ratna, "because they were strong women, poUtically, sociaUy, and  inteUectuaUy."  "Dance is a Uving tradition; it is a language. It is totaUy outdated to continue to do  Radha-Krishna, and Ram-Sita performances and to talk only about devoted wives. So it  is essential that we redefine what womanhood is and depict it in this tradition. It is important to show women who are weak and abused in society, as weU as to show women  who are defiant and strong. It is important to show marital relations in the perspective of  today's world and, finaUy, it is important to acknowledge that sexuality is not sin.  "Odissi dance is a very sensuous dance—they try and they try to take the sensuality  out. In the Judeo- Christian tradition, woman are put down, the body is put down and the  mind elevated. I feel, in the process of re-claiming and elevating women, we have to reclaim  and elevate the body."  An important phase in Ratna's life was the time she spent learning from women  dancers.  "During my teenage years in Calcutta I was in contact with so called 'prostitute' dancers  of the red Ught district and that is where I learnt my abhinaya [the acting part of classical  dance]. So essentiaUy the abhinaya I do is very much hke the dancers who would sit there  and dance—using their faces. That was totaUy untraditional. At that time, nobody knew  about me going to the 'prostitutes'—it was one of my underground activities.  "In Puri, I worked with Dungri Mahari, a temple devdasi, and I learnt abhinaya from  her. Her dance was a private prayer. What has happened with me is that even though I  dance on stage, a lot of the time I am isolated, in my own private world, in my prayer, in  my despair and sorrow, or in my joy in being a woman. So I use this training I learnt from  her to express myself as a woman."  In keeping with the tradition of the dance, Ratna prepares for her performance in the  old ways. "I prepare for the dance in a ritualistic way. The ornaments I wear came down  from the devdasis, and I have kept up the tradition as I have been asked to by Dungri  Mahari. I also fast before every performance."  All of the music used in Ratna's performances is from the best musicians Orissa has. "AU  of my music is original music for the particular dances I do. There are only two or three  dancers in the world who do these particular dances." A gifted performer and a respected  teacher, Ratna continues to reclaim both the history and the dance of the devdasi tradition.  Ratna will perform at the Robson Square Media Centre in Vancouver on September 12. See Bulletin Board for details. She is also working on a book on the Odissi  tradition of dance, which she hopes to have completed by 1998.

Just two years ago, Cadell was supporting her musical vision through her day job  answering phones for a classified department at a newspaper. Today, her recording, angel food for thought, is climbing  the record charts in Canada, propeUed by  an overwhelming response to her hit song  "The Sweater." The song takes an ironic  and witty look at the perUs of high school  romance, whUe the album is as diverse as  recordings get. It ranges from the humorous to the whimsical, combining music and  spoken word.  CadeU spoke to Kinesis on the phone  in early August from her home in Toronto,  where she is taking a short break before she  embarks on a cross-Canada tour in mid-  September.  We talked about her beginnings and  how she landed her record deal in  Canada and world wide. In 1989, her  first recording, Talking Like Crazy received limited distribution.  Talking Like Crazy was never really released. I didn't have the money to release  it. I got an Explorations grant from the  Canada CouncU to do the work. My Dad  lent me some money and I think I made  300 copies in total that went to record companies and radio stations and it did succeed in getting a record deal, which was  La Gala  VANCOUVER'S FIRST SURREALIST BALL, CELEBRATING  THE CINEMATHEQUE'S 2011, YEAR OF REAL & SURREAL CINEMA  WITH ALL PROCEEDS TO THE MEMBERS' LIBRARY & ARCHIVES  EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED...  • A SURPRISE PREMIERE SCREENING At The Cinimathiaue Theatre,  With Admission Limited To The Rut 200 Gala Ticket Buyers  .

I've often wondered whether it was going to happen no matter what or whether it was a series of bizarre circumstances. I sent it to a  lot of American labels as there were very  few Canadian independent companies at the  time.  I was seUing classified ads over the phone  for a paper in Toronto and overheard a  columnist talking about the New Music  Seminar in New York (a showcase for new  musicians). I asked her who sends people  down there and she told me Stuart Raven-  hUl at Intrepid Records. So I fired my tape  off to him, he loved it and put me in the  Canadian Showcase that summer (1990). It  did weU enough and the media loved it, so  Intrepid said "let's put you back in the studio, sign you up and put a record out."  The Sire deal [a recording contract with a  US and worldwide recording company] followed quickly after the release in Canada .  My stuff is so 'out there' and I never had  anyone approach me before—I had a lot of  musician support but never had media or  record company support. It aU fell together  very quickly.  We discussed the balance she is able  to sustain with her feminist material  and reaching a diverse audience.  I am a woman's voice and I write from  that perspective. I only know the world as .  a woman, it's the only way I can see it and  I think there are a lot of ways to talk about  gender issues and constraints without taking sides and pointing fingers. For example,  so much of comedy is about us-and-them issues. Look at how many racist and sexist  acts there are. It's so easy to draw a Une  and then you can laugh at the other side  and point fingers. I make a division in my  hfe between what I would put on a record  and say on the stage and what I beUeve in  my Ufe and would act on.  I'm pro-choice and I wUl march but [my  song] "Being in love" is as close as I'U get to  stating that. I wUl not say on a record every  woman has a right to choose. I just think  it makes for bad art. It's important to say  it in a different way, to have aU those views  and have them flow through the work as opposed to being didactic. First of all, because  no one wUl Usten and it's not a good way to  send the message across.  Labels are something that Cadell  struggles with every day. She has been  called everything from a novelty act to  a comic with the commercial success of  her single "The Sweater." We talked  about the relentless comparisons and labelling.  I think that I speak in a universal voice.  I am not interested in codifying or 'vague-  ifying' what I have to say. I think I use popular imagery and language to say what I  am saying. I just think it is the most rational way for me to work. In "The Sweater,"  it's consistent with the rest of my album. I  did not release it thinking, 'oh yes, this is  a throwaway for the kiddies.' It's my beUefs  and poUtics, it's true to me.  It's so strange for me—"The Sweater'  [goes from being ] played on college radio  and the CBC as an interesting track written  by a woman looking back at the constraints  of high school—which is what it is—to being played on top-40 as a wacky song where  I get the most inane stupid fuckin' questions by top-40 deejays. I get frustrated. I  made something because I wanted to and  to have it become so commodified is sickening. I have a bit of a problem sometimes  with it. I love that I've reached more people than I could imagine through these commercial channels, so I love the diversity that  Vancouver is Proud to Host  OUTRIGHTS/  LES DROITS VISIBLES  Second Pan-Canadian Conference on  Lesbian & Gay Rights  October 9, 10, & 11, 1992  Robson Square Media Centre  Vancouver, B.C.

However, I don't hke my work being chatted about on that level.  In the media, things are supposed to fit  into nice slots. And so often with musical  artists, [deejays] will say "well, it's kind of  hke The Chills mixed with the Cure with a  pinch of whatever." It's such a classic way  of describing something you don't know. I  guess it's to get some reference point. Mine  becomes so diverse that it becomes laughable, the things that I get compared to.  "Jane Siberry crossover to Sandra Bernhardt" came up a lot in the beginning. Now  it's everything from The Mothers of Invention to Spalding Gray to Laurie Anderson,  Joni MitcheU, Carly Simon. It's a whole  mixed bag of stuff. At least they're not all  folk singers.  Young teenage women are big fans of  Cadell's work. We discussed this phenomenon.  I didn't know what to expect. I had no  idea who would hke it or how much it would  be hstened to or played. It excites me very  much. It certainly is a big responsibihty.  I was at the Edmonton Folk Festival last  weekend and I had eight- and nine-year-  old girls as well as women of all ages. [She  laughs.] I don't usually get the teenage boys!  It's a big responsibihty, especially with so  many teenagers into my work. I'm glad I  can reach such varied age ranges.  In September, Cadell's record company is re-releasing a version of her  song "Barbie" as a dance track. I asked  her the obvious question about this particular piece ... the influence Barbie  had on her life.  I know there is the reference to her but  I didn't really write it about Barbies. As a  matter of fact, it wasn't a very important  thing in my hfe at all. She is more of a symbol. There is a devastating study that was  done a couple of years ago that girls in the  western world have a certain courage and  joie de vivre and feehng of optimism and  uncontrollable spirit up until seven or eight  and, at this point, it is very much broken.  Girls after this [age] are not so sure of themselves, not so sure they can succeed or of  their strength. It's so true. The piece "Barbie" fits into this somewhere—how come a  girl can lead any hfe she wants in imaginary  play and not do any of those things in her  real hfe?  Cadell has had to adjust to the  changes, both positive and negative,  that come with her popularity and success. We talked about how she is coping  with these changes.  At times there is tremendous stress and a  lack of time for myself. It's so easy not to say  no. The business as a whole, from managers  to agents can work you so hard that there is  no time for writing or solitude. When I get  frazzled, I have to remind myself that if I  had put out a record no one was interested  in, I would have been disappointed.  There certainly is a down side to success  and popularity in terms of how much it consumes your time and how many bozos want  something from you. I certainly have a lot  more friends than I used to and I need to  sort that one out. It's all in the realm of  what is expected, but you never really know  what it's hke until it happens to you.

Where do the facts of race, class,  age, political positioning, privilege, and visibility fit within this notion? Are these what  determine a mandate?"  These questions form the driving force  behind the show, Revising The Mandate. Bowen and Setzer had some specific agendas in putting together the show:  they wanted local work that was specifically lesbian—and therefore pohtical—from  emerging artists, and they wanted to ensure  representation from lesbians of colour.  As a whole, the project is a success—an  inclusive presentation of overtly lesbian art.  Unfortunately, few of the individual works  exhibited seem to engage in any meaningful way with the compelling questions presented by the show as a whole. Specifically,  most of the artists don't get beyond the  question of lesbian visibUity.  More than half of the eight Vancouver-  based artists represented here are working  in either photography or film/video. From  Elizabeth Vanderkooy's photo spread—a  collage of documentary images (smUing  faces and befuddled male onlookers) of  this past February's rainsoaked Dykes on  the Drive march—to Wendylin McFarlane  (RubY)'s carefuUy composed calendar shots  of white S/M dykes, photography is used as  a ready means of creating lesbian visibUity.  What's missing from these pieces, though,  is any attempt to dig below the surface of  the images.  Photographer Shaira Holman's "Picture  a Day" attempts to go further. The piece  is formaUy arresting—a giant-sized contact  sheet where, in the space of 30 frames/days,  we see her go from freshly bald to slightly  fuzzy. Hung behind it is another huge emulsion with frames of text corresponding to  each of the images beginning with "I shaved  my head today" and tracing the artist's  thoughts and feehngs as the project pro-  constraining—she alludes to issues of sexuahty, power, head/body hair, Jewish identity, fascism, postmodern rhetoric and even  Dr. Seuss without exploring any of them in  depth. The net effect is a laundry hst of hot  topics rather than a meaningful grappling  with any one of them.  By contrast, Tien Pee's video, "bare,"  takes one of the icons of lesbian visibUity—  women with shaved heads—and brings it  to hfe. Juxtaposing interview clips and  mugshots of three bare-headed women  with images of shaving paraphernalia, Pee  presents a range of reasons for the practice—everything from retaliation against  cultural stereotypes to saving money on  shampoo. The video is culturally inclusive, technically sophisticated, stylish and  insightful—a work that goes several steps  beyond just being seen.  Another video, Susan Harman's "Woho-  shenij deals specificaUy with lesbian sexuahty. It is a beautifuUy filmed composition  of lesbian lovemaking that goes beyond simple visibUity only insofar as it challenges the  position of the viewer by depicting its 'actors' as viewers of their own experience.  Untitled by Susan Hickey  Another thoughtful take on lesbian images is found in Suzo Hickey's paintings,  which explore "the daUy reality of hfe as  a lesbian in Vancouver." Her most striking  piece is a painting, composed of ten painted  wood panels, interspersing common images  of domesticity—clothespins, a teacup, a carrot, towels—with fragments of expUcit lesbian sexual imagery. Superimposed over the  images are the words: "H you can't stand  the heat, stay out of the kitchen"—a radical  revision of the old dictum about a woman's  place being in the home.  Picture a Day by Shaira Holman  Charged as it is with the break from tradition, lesbian art can incorporate media  not typicaUy associated with gaUery installations. Clo LaurenceUe, for example, has  chosen to represent herself with a poem  posted on the waU. Entitled "To Whom It  May Concern," the poem is, in LaurenceUe's  words, "a polite way of saying 'how to po-  eticaUy say fuck you or, hke, get over it wUl  you!'." The poem constitutes a breaking of  painful sUence around LaurenceUe's own experience of being "a white enough yet un  bleachable dyke."  Another unconventional work is Sur  Mehat's "sixbooks for public and private usage." The piece consists of a series of blank  books into which Mehat has pasted images  and bits of text cut out of magazines. Before you snort that you could do that yourself any old day—used to do it when you  were ten, in fact—listen to what Mehat has  to say about it: "The sixbooks . . . Ulus-  trate the various registers on which the lesbian gaze functions through the hberation  of vestiges of the much-loved-and-despised  fashion magazine and recontextualizes them  by and for the lesbian gaze ... [The books  utilize] a strategy of pastiche in order to excavate pleasure whUe undermining the commercial exploitation of lesbianism ... " H  you can figure that out, you're welcome to  come over and take away aU my diplomas!  That there is a community of emerging  lesbian artists of aU stripes who are creating works concerned with the pohtics of lesbian identity is encouraging. And the show  has an important function in the lesbian  community—the opening of Revising The  Mandate was a bona fide Event and there  were many grateful comments in the guest  book. I only hope for the day when lesbian  visibUity becomes so taken for granted that  these and other artists emerge to engage  more deeply with some of the other issues  that lesbian identity entails.  The text adds another dimension to the  images, but perhaps Holman's format is too  Kathleen Oliver is a regulai  arts writer.  Kinesis  KINESIS Arts  /^^^^^^%<^^^^  Getting Wet: Tales of Lesbian Seductions:  Between the covers  by Shannon e. Ash  Yes, yet another anthology of lesbian  short stories. No doubt you want to know:  is this one worth picking up? Getting Wet:  Tales of Lesbian Seductions is a diverse  coUection of 26 stories and poems, anthologized by Carol AUain and Rosamund El-  win. Published by Toronto's Women's Press  this June, it's only the second Canadian  anthology of lesbian erotica—the first was  By Word of Mouth, published by gyn-  ergy/ragweed.  Getting Wet's 'erotica' classification  may not be entirely accurate, although the  title and the back cover reference to "sex  fiction" encourage it—not all the stories explicitly focus on sex, although they all follow the theme of seduction.  The tales span a range of styles and  approaches—romance, historical fiction, humour, autobiography, fantasy and fable, poetry, expUcit sex fiction, women in bars, in  the country, in the nineteenth century, and  in the future. This diversity keeps Getting  Wet interesting, a 'something for everyone'  approach that remains accessible.  The comedy or humour pieces are a  welcome addition to lesbian erotica, which  can be serious stuff. Notable are Van-  couverite Lovie Sizzle's "Coin Operator,"  an exquisitely funny piece about lust in  a laundromat—or should I say with a  laundromat—and Jan's "A Horny Corny  Story," a self-conscious poke at lesbian sex  fiction. This sort of imagination is continued in Beth Brant's "Coyote Learns a New  Trick," where traditional Native characters 1  take on new meanings.  The stories that work best are those with |  a convincing content —characters, a story-  Une, poetic and realistic descriptions of the  surroundings. Examples are the convinc-  ...not all  the stories  explicitly  focus on sex,  though they  all follow the  theme of  seduction.  Jackie Hegadorn? Jackie Haywood?

Some stories are short, simple, weU-crafted records of moments between two women—"Every Touch," by Andrea Freeman, and "Ambivalence," by Jennifer Catchpole, are good examples. The an-  ^ £ thology includes five poems, which are a  ^2 welcome addition .although only Lois Fine's  |s;  "Sweet Meat" reaUy moved me.  i-°      On the down-side, some of the writing in  1 %  Getting Wet is mediocre or simply confus-  I °- ing. Diane Carley's "Pools of Heat," despite  I     a concluding twist which took me by surprise, suffers from an overdose of awkward  simUes. For example, "As the curved shadows slowly became women, I felt the weight  of the city slip from my shoulders hke rain  off a slanted roof."  Karen Tulchinsky's "Latex and Lube"  reads hke an information booklet along the  hnes of 'how to pick up a woman and have  safe casual sex.' It struck me as unconvincing and artificial—"I am on top of her. She  is on top of me."—and left me wondering, is  this the lesbian Dick and Jane? Some pieces  were simply confusing: an excerpt from a  play by Muriel Miguel seemed out of context and left me puzzled, while Tamai Koy-  bayashi's "Time TraveUer" made me wonder what her point was.  The overaU arrangement of the pieces in  Getting Wet is effective, maintains a ttii't  of styles, and the contributor's notes at the  end of the book are detaUed and informative. However, the cover graphic and lettering is busy and rather sloppy—I'm a fan of  simple hnes.  Some pieces of this book wUl stay with  me, many wUl soon lapse from memory but  overaU it's an enjoyable read and one of  the better lesbian anthologies around—the  book's first printing is almost sold out and  a second printing is hkely.  Yet the question remains—is this enduring lesbian hterature? On that, I'm a bit  doubtful. However, I beheve it was Susie  Bright (aka Sexpert) who said sex fiction  isn't supposed to be great hterature, it's  supposed to turn you on. What turns me on  is content—a great story, believable characters, and good writing—not descriptions  of someone's dUdo-handUng technique or a  dripping cunt.  Shannon e. Ash is an ex-army brat  and a dyke of European heritage. She  has recently moved from Ontario and  now writes in Vancouver.  A launch with raunch  by Shannon e. Ash  Getting Wetfs West Coast launch took place at a Vancouver gay and lesbian bar August 12, where four of the anthology's writers read their works. The Shaggy Horse was  fiUed but not overflowing for the hour-long readings.  Introducing the event on behalf of the launch's sponsor, Little Sister's Bookstore, Janine  FuUer, talked about the weU-known gay and lesbian bookstore's battle with Canada Customs, which consistently seizes the bookstore's shipments of printed matter at the border.  FuUer pointed out that it's a costly and frustrating situation. She caUed on audience members to support Little Sister's by making donations to the bookstore's legal fund or showing up in court on September 28. A selection of lesbian publications seized at the border  and an anti-censorship petition were on display.  Jackie Hegadorn was the first to read. She read her piece, "Coin Operator," rather than  performing it as Lovie Sizzle, who is credited with the piece in Getting Wet. "Lovie was  seized at the border," explained Hegadorn.  "The piece belongs to Lovie," says Hegadorn, referring to her character, who has done  stand-up comedy and was part of the 1991 Queer Culture Festival in Toronto. "It's one of  my favourites ... a great piece to perform."  Hegadorn, a "late-blooming lesbian in her 40s," active in women and HrV/AH)S issues  in Vancouver," usuaUy writes under the name Jackie Haywood, "which was my grandmother's name ... and hey, she was a writer too."  Her weU-timed dehvery at the Shaggy of this delightful piece—in which picking up a  Kenmore at the laundromat bears more than a httle resemblance to a night at a dyke  bar—brought laughter and applause.  Hegadorn says she wants to integrate humour into erotica, since erotica is a genre that  tends to be written about too seriously."We need humour in our lesbian hves," she says,  the kind "that really pushes your imagination" as opposed to a slapstick moment.  Hegadorn says she intends to continue writing humour—although a serious piece isn't  out of the question—because "that's what works for me ... comedy's always been part of  my soul."  Next up was Jennifer Catchpole. It was her first public reading and her nervousness was  apparent. She read "Ambivalence," a httle too quickly in a flat tone that lacked the sense  of real feehng I got from the book. Because she was foUowing Jackie Hegadorn's comedic  piece, the audience was stiU in a giggly mood, finding phrases funny that were meant in  aU seriousness in the writing itself.  Says Catchpole, "The issue of ambivalence [in relationships] is one I wanted to explore  in a story form. It's something everybody feels and nobody talks about."  Catchpole, an East Vancouver lesbian and single parent, was a founding editor of the  now defunct Diversity: The Lesbian Rag. "Ambivalence," the tale of a woman whose decision to end a difficult relationship is overturned by her desire, is her first published story.  Catchpole says that whUe not aU the stories in Getting Wet are expUcit 'erotica,' it's  the variety of contexts that is interesting. She adds that every story in Getting Wet fits  in as 'erotica', which encompasses everything to do with the erotic aspect of our hves.  Chants of "K T, K T" from a number of women at the front preceded Karen Tulchinsky's turn on stage. Although confident, her dehvery was flat and, dare I say, wooden,  emphasizing the instruction-booklet style of the story. Judging by the applause, however,  Karen was appreciated by many in the audience. A Jewish lesbian, poUtical activist and  writer, Tulchinsky was born and raised in Toronto, but has made Vancouver her home. Her  story "Latex and Lube" originaUy appeared in the 1991 Angles lesbian hterary supplement. She's also written stories for other soon-to-be-published anthologies, among which  are Lovers and Sister/Stranger.  Tulchinsky does not consider Getting Wet strictly an anthology on erotica. The theme is  seduction, she says, which doesn't necessarUy have to be expressed in erotica or sex fiction.  As for the message she was trying to convey in "Latex and Lube," Tulchinsky explains  she is "a firm behever in safe sex ... untU we know for sure [that there is not woman-  to-woman transmission of HIV]. We have to start eroticizing safe sex in our stories." She  includes safe sex in her story because "that's what I would do in that situation."  The final reading of the evening was performed by Chrystos, possibly the best-known  writer at the Shaggy that night. Not only has she performed numerous readings in Vancouver, but has two poetry books to her credit. She arrived on stage wearing sUver high  heel booties, preceded by the introduction, "I hope you'U get so wet you'U go home with  whoever's handy."  Chrystos did not read her piece "IdyU: Four Days" from Getting Wet, choosing instead  to read some new poems. Her descriptions of sexual encounters—not always of the 'poUti-  cally correct' kind—and relationship dynamics in the "telephone poem," and"don't tell me  you can't Uve without me ... 'cause honey, I ain't your lungs" were both humorous and  thoughtful and a good ending to the evening's readings.  KINESIS  Sept. 92 asssass^^  ARTS  ani difranco: an Interview:  Not just ani-body  by Charmaine Saulnier  Ahh... yet another Vancouver International Folk Festival plays out at Jericho  Beach Park in Vancouver. With some bodies drenched in sunscreen and many heads  protected under straw hats, we faithfuUy  made our way to the various stages searching for those 'folk' sounds' over that hot  June weekend.  For three days, one talented woman took  centre stage, capturing the attention of her  audience. Each time I watched the crowd  foUow ani difranco from workshop to workshop, I had a feehng I was part of something from the 60s, yet excited that this was  part of the 90s. Her music resonates with  rebeUion, defiance, pain, sorrow, love and  anger ... Ufe—in big bold letters. Clearly,  she touched the hearts of many as I watched  people leave her workshops with a renewed  sense of energy for social change.  I couldn't beheve my luck when I got an  opportunity to ask ani herself what experiences lay behind her passionately honest  lyrics.  She told me she began writing her own  songs at 15 and shortly after, was playing  bars and clubs in her home-town Buffalo,  NY. She only recently hit the folk festival  circuit, and she says she sometimes feels Uke  the 'token woman' at festivals. Vancouver  was different—among other strong women  performers holding court at the festival were  Cris WUUamson and Heather Bishop, respectively the US and Canadian 'legends' of  women's music.  Charmaine: Your poetry is very intense  and powerful. When did you decide to use  poetry as part of your stage performance?  ani: I started writing poetry before I  started writing songs. Personally, I find  there are things I can't do with words in  a song. And then there are words that can  only be put into songs. So, I chose which  'foU expresses myself best to others. My poetry reflects more practical stuff. And my  songs are not necessarily poetry.  Vancouver Int'l Comedy Fest:  ani difranco at the 1992 Vancouver Folk Festival  Although my material is about me and  my experiences, I find it difficult to write  about myself. Some songs are just about one  day in hfe, others are about hfe. A lot of  people came to me after the workshops and  told me how deeply affected they were by  my poetry. I was happy it reached people—  this is why I write.  Charmaine: Were there certain people  in your chUdhood that influenced your writing?  ani: I was always singing other [people]'s  music, particularly John Lennon's songs. At  15, I started to write my own songs. And  then I just started hanging out in clubs and  bars with friends of mine. My friends have  been the most influential people in my Ufe.  Charmaine: Your songs and poetry reflect a very personal account of hfe. Where  do you draw the hne between the personal  and the pohtical?  ant; I beheve nothing is personal. It's a  myth. H we don't share our experiences, we  alienate ourselves from each other. It's been  my experience that we aU share simUar ways  of being, of Uving in this world—although  my honesty has definitely created some antagonism between people. It was interesting  to hear one man's comment of my music at  the festival. He said, 'she's a lesbian, she  hates men ... but I hke her because she'  up-front about it.'  Charmaine: How did you feel about this  comment?  ani: WeU, the last thing people want to  know about is your anger. They don't know  how to deal with it. The press often describes me as militant and angry. However,  the people who are famihar with my work  are more affirmative. I receive much more  support from women. Men's reactions differ from each other. I learn about people  through their reactions to my music. This  is why I write. I play for them.  Charmaine: One of my favorite hnes  from your song, "In and Out" is, "I've got  no criteria for sex or race. You can't put me  on any shelf." Can you elaborate on what  you meant by this?  ani: I feel fortunate enough to be able  to love whomever I choose. This has been  personaUy positive for me. However, people's reactions have not been so embracing.  I have been left feehng Uke I'm on the outside ah the time, whether it be from the lesbian community or the heterosexual community. Neither wants to embrace me.  Charmaine: Do you identify yourself as  a feminist?  ani: In some ways. I feel the most important contribution is to give of ourselves  through the telling of our stories. I am very  conscious of the total absence and sUence  of women in our history and cultures. History is not representative of women's experiences and cultures. I beheve telhng 'our'  stories is a pohtical act and is what wUl actively change the sUence.

Geller  Women were out in force at Isadora's Coop Restaurant and other venues in Vancouver for the 6th Annual Vancouver International Comedy Festival, July 31 to August  9. Although I usuaUy do news pieces rather  than reviews for Kinesis, I was drawn to  the Women in Comedy event at Isadora's on  the strength of two of the performers, BC's  Jan Derbyshire and Ellen Cleghorne of Saturday Night Live.  The first weekend of the Festival at  Isadora's focused on BC performers. They  included Janice Ungaro, Jan Derbyshire,  Lori Ferguson and the two-woman troupe,  too blonde, a line-up that made for a long,  but hUarious, evening.  Along with the standard jokes about dating men and vaginal itching, there were  some refreshingly original hnes hke Christine Taylor's excerpts from "Man on the  Moon, Woman on the PiU" and the satirical  songs of too blonde. But it was the brash, in-  your-face, dyke humour of Jan Derbyshire  that captured my imagination and monopolized my attention. Her dead-pan, witty  poetry—"Fuck men ... I don't think so ..."  —and her powerful stage energy made for  a riveting performance. She also stood out  as the only woman telling 'lesbian' jokes.  There was, nevertheless, a notable uniformity among the women performing. All  of them were white, able-bodied and, with  the exception of Derbyshire, apparently  straight. As I was leaving Isadora's one  night, I overheard one woman's rhetorical  question to her companion: "What, are aU  the funny women in BC white?" It is disappointing that the organizers of the Women  in Comedy Festival couldn't have made  more of an effort to represent more diversity in their local performers.  The last weekend of the festival featured  comedy with a more international focus.  The evening's host was Vancouver comedian Janice Ungaro. While she was energetic, her performance was marred by a series of bad jokes that went over hke lead balloons. As weU, her attempts at patter with  the audience—"hi ... anybody here from  out of town?"—were stUted, awkward and  downright boring.  Fortunately, the featured entertainment  livened things up considerably. First up  were the Friends of Moira from Australia  made up of accordion-playing Carolyn Connors and  Susan  Arnold on  the  ukulele.  They hit the stage resplendent in crinoline dresses, heavy makeup and sUver lame  shoes. Their opening song "Your Baby Went  Down the Plug Hole" set the mood for their  farcical brand of humour as Connors played  "straight woman" to Arnold's hysterical  over-acting. But it was their lengthy rendition of "Doctor, Doctor" (complete with  heavy metal ukulele solo) that left a lot of  the audience faUing out of their chairs.  My main complaint about the performance was how short the Friends' set was.  Barely 30 minutes into their cheeky songs  and sight gags, the two women were finished and Ungaro was introducing EUen  Cleghorne.  For the uninitiated, Brooklyn-born Cleghorne is probably best known as Queen  Shaniqua on Saturday Night Live (SNL).  She also plays the annoying page who accosts SNL's guest hosts in the hallways of  NBC. Cleghorne kept the audience laughing  with a non-stop, partiaUy improvised monologue that lasted close to an hour—I was  too busy laughing to look at my watch. Her  jokes ran the gamut from sex and boyfriends  to mothers, smog, pregnancy and being on  the Oprah Winfrey show. Her impression of  a six year-old on the phone was brilliant and  convincing.  Charmaine Saulnier is still a 'budding ' Kinesis volunteer writer.  Lines without the punch  Cleghorne saved her most biting wit for  her discussion of anthropology and pornography. Her sardonic comments on how white  women's breasts on TV are porn whUe  Black women's breasts are anthropology  were part of a too-short routine about  racism that was both witty and cutting. Her  performance was by far the most polished  of aU the acts, not surprising given her film  and TV credentials.  My biggest criticism is not about the comedians at ah but rather about the organizers. The lack of diversity—Cleghorne was  the only woman of colour performing—at  the Women in Comedy festival marred what  was a great idea: to have women comedians  perform without apology to a largely female  audience.  On a more personal note, I would have  hked more pohtical humour with a strong  feminist message rather than jokes about  shopping and fashion—given the receptive  female audience the event draws, this would  have been entirely appropriate. Nonetheless, I did laugh, I did enjoy myself and I  wUl go back next year.  Lissa J.

Please get your letter to us by the  18th of the month.  If you can, keep the length to about  500 words (if you go way over, we  might edit for space).  Hope to hear from you soon.  Love,  Kinesis  Ignored  in LA  Kinesis:  I would hke to congratulate Kim WU-  liams, Monica Buchanan, Mercedes Baines,  D. Lydia Masemola and Janisse Browning  on their article entitled "Understanding the  Rage" in the June issue of Kinesis. Your  words helped to clarify many of the very  complex and painful issues which were overlooked by the mainstream media in the  wake of the LA uprising. I would, however,  hke to offer one observation.  I am a person of mixed indigenous Peruvian and European heritage and I was disappointed to note that the words of Latin  American women were not included in this  article. It is my personal feehng that this  was a rather serious editorial oversight.  The mainstream media completely ignored the fact that a majority—by some estimates, nearly 60 percent—of the participants in the LA uprising were Latina and  Latino. This cannot be ignored when one  considers that, in the US, poverty and unemployment levels in the Latin American  community are, in fact, higher than those in  the Black community. Futhermore, it cannot be overlooked that in Los Angeles, in  particular, Latinas and Latinos outnumber  African-Americans nearly three-to-one. As  the fastest growing visible minority group  in the US, the Latin American community  can no longer be ignored.  I do recognize that the LA uprising was  sparked by the brutal beating of a black  man (Rodney King) and the racist decision of the (white) legal system and that, as  such, the LA uprising is of particular importance to the African American community.  I realize, moreover, it is important for Black  people, and Black women in particular, to  act as leaders in this instance. But let us not  forget the big picture. Let us not overlook  the anger, the struggle and the rage of the  Latina/Latino communities here in Canada  and the US. Let us buUd bridges.  Sincerely,  Lucho van Isschot  Vancouver, BC  Cutting LINCs  with women  Kinesis:  I was glad to see the article on federal  cuts to Enghsh language training in your  June issue ("Language training cuts target  immigrant women.") The much-touted new  federal language program, LINC, is reaUy a  cutback in disguise which wUl impact on aU  immigrants but especiaUy women.  As you mentioned, one main problem is  the very low level of traimng provided—  certainly not enough to get a job, enter an  educational program or take up an apprenticeship. Perhaps your readers wiU be interested to know just what standard of Enghsh  LINC provides.  "Speech is limited, mostly understandable. Vocabulary limited to high frequency  words. Listening comprehension is sufficient  to foUow basic instructions. Simple writing  tasks can be done, although with errors.  Able to read short, simple passages on famihar topics." When a student attains this  level their training is terminated.  Is this sufficient Enghsh to get a job and  take one's place in an EngUsh-speaMng society or is this the type of Enghsh spoken  by people in the cheap-labour pool?  As an Ontario Enghsh as a Second Language teacher, I have been working with  other teachers in my province to get the  truth out about LINC. Please allow me to  give a few detaUs.  Although $80 miUion has been promised  for language training, the money is not accessible, at least not in this province. Only  $5.83 an hour per chent wiU be aUotted for  training, totalling $87.45 an hour to run a  class of 15 students. AU expenses of the program have to come out of this amount, both  for the teaching and running of the chUd  care facility which is mandatory and must  be set up on site.  This includes: salary of accredited language teacher; salary of chUd care worker;  aU   educational   supphes   including   text  books, etc; aU costs for the facility including rent; all costs to set up the child minding including toys, etc; transportation allowance for aU students; aU administrative  costs; and aU other costs associated with  running a program.  I am sure anyone involved with training  can see that it wiU be very difficult to set  up under LINC with this grotesquely low  funding. ChUdcare on site is mandatory but  only the most cut-rate care can be given  at these rates. Across Ontario hundreds of  mini-chUdcare facUities wUl be set up under  LINC with no standards, guidelines or monitoring.  There are many, many other problems  with LINC. The Ontario Women's Training  CoaUtion has taken the lead in protesting  LINC. On May 30, the Ontario government  announced they were asking the federal government to delay LINC for one year. No reply has been received to date.  Each province signs its own training  agreement with the federal government and  LINC may be administered differently in  different provinces. I would be very happy  to hear from anyone who can fill me in on  LINC elsewhere.  Sincerely,  Joan Baril  Thunder Bay, Ont.  A note  of thanks  I want to tell you how much I appreciate  Kinesis.  From January to July 1992, I was in In-  vermere, BC on a research leave writing a  book entitled Spirituality and Feminism.  Kinesis was a valuable resource for me  with respect to keeping up with the current  issues—pohtical, economic, social, etc.  I think Kinesis is a marvelous resource  for anyone interested in social issues—in a  broad sense of 'social'. I have several references to it in my book.  Thank you for your good work.

Intended to dehght,  confound, and generaUy get your mind off other things, the 8th annual festival runs from  September 10-20 and plays cost $8-10 each. Discount tickets avaUable daUy for selected  shows are $4.50. We thought Kinesis readers might hke a preview of some of the women's  work to be sampled at the Fringe:  Local faves Random Acts (aka Jackie Crossland and Nora Randall) are back with The  House of Agnes: More Lesbian Stories. These wonderful storyteUers are not to be  missed.  England's witty feminist trio, Sensible Footwear wUl be bringing us more of their irresistible cabaret, while fellow Britisher Naomi Cooke's play about Pope Joan, Pink Smoke  in the Vatican, comes highly recommended from Fringe Festivals east of here.  An Amorous Discourse in the Suburbs of HeU was a favourite at last year's Women  in View Festival—if you missed it, here's your chance. And those who enjoyed Kate the  Great in Cracked Up last year wiU want to catch her in Dorothy Discovers (that's right,  the one who went to Oz).  Jeanette AUen is a co-writer of Columbus in Jamestown Ka-Hanuka Pa-koos, a collaboration between three theatre companies that questions colonialism in its historical and  present forms.  Tracy LeAnne Johnson's Milking Shakespeare promises to combine feminism and  Shakespeare in ways that are both moving and funny, whUe Charming and Rose, True  Love, from Saskatchewaner KeUy Jo Burke, is a comedy that carries a "traditional language and feminism warning." Consider yourselves warned.  Vancouverite Suzanne Andersen's Yes, Officer, I'm Sure, the Tree Belongs to Me  was a winner at the Springrites '91 playwright's competition. And Critics is a performance  art piece written by 13-year-old Alys Howe.  Dance fans wUl want to check out Desert Scenes...Dry Mouth, Earth Celebration  and Samarambi: Pounding of the Heart.

Kinesis:  The 39th sex trade worker from Vancouver was murdered on July 6, 1992. She was  drugged by a trick. He is being charged  with possession for the purpose of trafficking. 'Toni' (her working name) seems to be  irrelevant. Her death means nothing to the  pohce, to the feminists who work on the issue of violence against women, to society in  general.  I know many of us are busy going to consultations, panel hearings etc. What we hear  at the consultations and hearings is a call  for femimst salaries in order to keep feminist services alive—the same services that  prostitutes don't have access to. There isn't  one transition house which accepts prostitutes who choose to continue to work. Rape  crisis centres offer employment counselUng  rather than what she's called for—support  in dealing with his behaviour.  It's clear to me and lots of sex trade workers I spoke with, that your salaries are more  important than our Uves.  Sincerely,  Karin Mladerovic  POWER (Prostitutes and Other Women for  Equahty Rights)  Vancouver, BC  She's a  fighter  Kinesis:  I have been foUowing with considerable  interest your coverage of the fight for justice  that Kim Anda Jarzebiak has been waging  against Langara CoUege [see June issue,  I have noticed many similarities between  Kim's fight and the struggles both myself and people I know have tried to wage  against institutions who do not want to admit their wrong-doing. I've come to some  very cynical conclusions about the way that  institutions operate and the quirks of human nature that seem to insure they continue to operate in a seU-protective way.  Firstly, most people put fear of losing  their jobs or status above their sense of justice (if they have any). Nice to see that this  backfired for David Cane.  When the wronged party (I wUl not use  the word 'victim' as this has become a term  of contempt) is persistent in pursuing justice, her concerns are individualized. She is  made to feel that her problems stem from  the fact that she is somehow reacting in  the wrong way. She has a 'personality clash'  with the oppressor. Her perceptions are off  because she is crazy or neurotic.  For example, David Cane is "saddened  that Jarzebiak 'found it necessary to leave  Langara because of what she perceives as  ongoing harassment'. "—my italics. The  complainant is "just being a victim." It always amazes me that, the more one stands  up for oneself the more people scream,  'You're just being a victim!"  Lastly, the institution is perceived as being more important and more worthy of protection than the wronged individual. The  individual is accused of 'trying to make  trouble' and of discrediting an institution  that is really being discredited by its own  lack of action, its own denial.  Thank you Kinesis for aUowing Kim  Anda Jarzebiak to state publicly that she is  not a victim, she is a fighter!  Sincerely,  Anne MUes  Gibsons, BC  Who are we  protecting?  Kinesis:  ChUd protection—what are the answers?  gUchrist RusseU's description of the speakers before the panel to review chUd protection was a screaming patriarchal reversal  [see Kinesis, June 1992.]  Social workers, welfare advocates, foster  parents and battered women's shelter staff  were described as the "caregivers" whose  "passionate accounts" of the issue of chUd  protection instructed the government panel.  Other than foster moms, there was no mention of testimony by the real caregivers, the  mothers. No solution to the problem of chUd  abuse, or any other violence in our systems,  wiU be created by the armchair "experts"  and professionals who "serve" the victims.  Victims (survivors if you prefer) must be  the majority in formulating solutions. Society must take leadership from victims.  Since aU "chUd protection" plans target primarUy single moms raising chUdren  among unprecedented violence and isolation, professionals both in government and  "service" must take leadership from the  real experts, in this case, the moms raising chUdren in poverty and isolation, after  being abandoned by the individual fathers  and abandoned and blamed by the father  run systems.  In the USA, we often hear propaganda  about the huge increase in chUd abuse investigations. "Welfare Reform" has been an excuse for the male media, poUticians and bureaucrats to focus on the aUeged "immorality" of single mothers—drug abuse, chUd  abuse, fraud—who must be controlled by  yet more punitive government and agency  "programs" to take money and chUdren  away from single mothers. "ChUd abuser"  has become the latest in a long hst of stereotypes used against single moms (another patriarchal reversal since we know that most  violence against chUdren is committed by  men, not women.)  Now the focus of social, pohtical and economic programs is to protect the children  from their mothers!! (So much easier and  more fun than trying to protect them from  the real dangers our chUdren face: gangs,  drug dealers, pimps, father-figure violence  and rape, lead paint poisoning, toxic poising, asthma caused by inner city industrial and suburban commuter poUution etc.)  This latest control of single moms works as  genocide against the poor of aU races by  breaking up and stigmatizing our famiUes,  whUe faUing to protect our chUdren from  that lethal Ust of daily dangers in their hves.  Control of single moms is also a big  money-maker for our "caregivers." Every  time the government gets one of our chUdren, a pack of professionals are guaranteed a hving wage for months or even years.  At least five lawyers, three social workers,  two psychologists, and a couple of therapists gain financial security as long as  they hold the chUd. More and more private agencies are being created or flourishing with government contracts paying them  to oversee visits, therapy etc. By requiring  a circus of fiery hoops for moms to jump  through—parenting classes, therapy, psychological evaluations—they not only provide income for their own communities, they  also enjoy the apparently enormously satisfying privUege of exerting total control over  a poor, single mother—through her chUd!  Am I too cynical? And what about the  chUdren who reaUy need protection? What  about the moms who actually do abuse  their chUdren? Unfortunately, this system of  witch-hunts against single moms and First  Nation families tends to protect the abusers  by exhausting limited funds and time pursuing mothers because of class, sex, race and  personal bias, instead of stopping violence.  Recently two of our members (Welfare  Warriors) had chUdren taken into state custody because in one case a hostUe project  maintenance man and in the other case a  hostUe male neighbor, told pohce that the  moms were outside with a chUd improperly dressed for the weather!! Neither mom  has managed to get her chUdren back home  yet. The chUdren are suffering even more  that the moms. They are becoming more  and more insecure and scared that they wUl  never see their moms again. The moms are  aUowed one hour visits once a week—if the  social worker from the private agency manages to find the time. (Compare these visits  to the fathers' rights to visit after raping or  abusing a cluld or mom.)  TraditionaUy, chUdren have been raised  by communities of people—not one woman  under attack. Being totaUy dependent on  one person (with aU of her imperfections) is  an ineffective, dangerous system. We need  to create new ways of finding community  to raise chUdren, now that tribal famiUes,  extended famUies and even nuclear-famUies  have disappeared.  I have not presented the short-term solutions to end this violence against chUdren. Much Uke violence against women, it  is increasing with the increase of violent,  fascistic control being used against aU poor  women, chUdren and First Nations peoples.  We the victims must band together and  take leadership to find and create solutions,  whUe exposing the violent ones using social, poUtical, physical and economic violence against us.  Sincerely,  Pat Gowens, Editor  Welfare Mothers Voice  Milwaukee, WI  Lesbians and  the law  Kinesis  Earher this year, the Legal Education  and Action Fund (LEAF) organized consultations, in Vancouver, Toronto and Hahfax,  on what lesbians want from the law and the  legal system and how to get what we want.  At the Vancouver consultation, about 40  women spent the day debating these issues.  (See Kinesis May and July/August). There  was interesting discussion but no clear consensus. It was decided to continue meeting and, since then, the Vancouver Lesbian Strategy Coalition has been formed  with representatives from such groups as  the Vancouver Lesbian Connection, the Lesbian k Gay Benefits Committee and the  Lesbian & Gay Immigration Task Force.  Our short-term goal is to produce a position paper which analyzes and recommends  legal strategies that best serve the interests  of aU lesbians, including lesbians of colour,  lesbians with disabiUties and lesbian parents. This letter is to invite representatives  from other lesbian groups as weU as individual lesbians to participate in the debate.  Along with this we want to continue to  dialogue with LEAF as weU as others representing lesbians in the courts, so that strategies they pursue are those we support.  Two meetings have been scheduled to begin drafting a paper which would set out  the issues, looking at what there is (and is  not) now in the law and how this both helps  and hinders our Uves. We wUl be specificaUy questioning the pros and cons of having 'sexual orientation' included in human  rights legislation and the Charter. Also, we  wUl look at how, or if, we want our famiUes defined. Please caU Carol Nielsen at 251-  6046 if you want to participate in this endeavour.  This paper wiU be presented at a forum  for discussion of these issues at the Out-  rights/Les Droits Visible Conference, October 9-11, in Vancouver.  WestWord  Part III  Sincerely,  Diana Smith  Vancouver Lesbian Strategy CoaUtion  Vancouver, BC  .KINESIS  Kinesis,  I would Uke to respond to the letter by  Diana Atkinson, a member of the group of  women who attended WestWord 7 in Vancouver.  I too attended the writing retreat for  women. I remember Diana weU, although  she was not a part of the poetry class The  Sad and Hungry Poets (SAHP). I remember  her telUng me, after SAHP had done their  readings, that she looked forward to reading my published poetry.  I remember the shock and buzz that permeated the halls and cafeteria when we discovered she had gone just a few days before  the end of the retreat. I remember a cryptic  note on the whiteboard on the door of her  room. I wondered about her for a long time  and what it was that caused her to leave.  Imagine my surprise when, after one of  my forays into Bold Print, the Winnipeg  women's bookstore to pick up the latest issue of Kinesis, I found a letter from Diana  Atkinson, containing blanket accusations of  ostracization,.discrimination and "intellectual rape."  I considered my experience as a member  of the group of women Diana described and  wondered where I was when all this took  place. I found myself angry at Diana's insis-  stance that aU women at WestWord 7 were  against her, as she described in her 'them  against me' stance.  I found the group dynamic overall, and  especially in the poetry section, to be one  of acceptance, exhilaration and hberation.  I wish that aU the women attending could  have enjoyed the same. Diana obviously did  not. I do not dispute that some women there  may have been rude and crude in their attitudes and comments-but not aU of us were!  I feel Diana paints herself with her own  brush here. She says 'they' (meaning me and  aU the other women who were there) violate her poUcy of respect given for respect  received. Has she not, by lumping the many  of us in with the rude and crude few, shown  how much respect she has for us?  Sincerely,  Laurel D. Johnson  Matlock, MB  Jacqueline Frewin,  friend and carpenter,  died, from cancer, in her home  on Salt Spring Island  on 21 August 1992.  Those who knew her will remember her pride and  strength, her skill and knowledge as a carpenter/  contracted'/designer,her■tremendous low,beautyandspmt.  She opened the sky the night she died and showed  off to us all with the flash of her spirit, the thunder of her  rage, and the rain of her great sorrow and joy.  Let us meet our grief with hope. Go in peace,  Jacqueline.
