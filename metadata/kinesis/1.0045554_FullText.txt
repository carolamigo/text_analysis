Special feature: Union Women in  British Columbia during the Great  Depression KINESIS JUNE   '79  Gay Tide washed out by Supreme Court  The final word is out.  The verdict—  which hardly elicited much suprise -  practically declares the finding of  the B.C. Human Rights Branch's board  of inquiry on the discrimination case  against the Vancouver Sun as null "  and void.  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court  of Canada, on May 22, upheld the B.  C. Court of Appeal ruling which  states that the Sun had "reasonable  cause" to refuse to run a classified  advertisement submitted by the Gay  Alliance Toward Equality (GATE).  We  lost per se,  said Maurice Flood,  spokesperson for the alliance, but  we did not really lose in the strict  sense.     This is a test case we brought  on ourselves and the outcome held no  surprises for us.  Flood stressed that the case, which  took five years to conclude, was  meant to emphasize the fact that the  B.C. Human Rights Code does not protect people on the basis of sexual  orientation.  "Had no illusions"  We had no illusions that we were going to win,   added Flood. It would  have been great if we did—but the  fact is—we wanted to prove a point  and we did.  As early as December 1972 GATE representatives asked for a meeting  with the minister of labor of the  newly-elected NDP government to discuss with him gay rights and the  new Human Rights Code which was being re-written.  The minister refused a meeting saying that he believed that "homosexuality should  not receive the benefit of legal  sanction."  The Human Rights Code was legislated  by the NDP in November 1973 and proclaimed a year later.  It was obvious that reference to gays was  omitted. However King, in remarks  to the press, claimed that the new  code protected gays by virtue of  the "reasonable cause" clause which  is embedded in Section 3 of the code.  This section says no person should  discriminate "unless reasonable  cause exists for such denial or  discrimination." It goes on to  specify that race, religion, color,  ancestry or place of origin as well  as sex of any person (unless it relates to the maintenance of public  decency) does not constitute reasonable cause.  "Society not ready for homosexuals"  When Bill King, then labor minister,  finally met with GATE, he maintained  that society was not ready for homosexuality and that inclusion of  "sexual orientation" in the new code  would encourage impressionable youth  to engage in homosexual activities.  GATE decided to see if■"reasonable  cause" is enough assurance that homosexuals and lesbians are protected  under the new code.  The test case took five years, and  an endless amount of organizing.  A human rights board of inquiry, three  courts hearings, three elections later  GATE finally succeeded in driving home  its point: the B.C. Human Rights  Code is a joke.  The Supreme Court judgment means  that gays, a specific minority group,  can not claim legal rights under the  code.  There is shock in the realization  that this ruling can be used against  other minorities and ultimately  against the rights of all people—  based as it is on the irrational  and reactionary view that prejudice  exists;  therefore prejudice is  correct,  says an editorial in Gay ■  Tide, the GATE newsletter, after-  the B.C. Court of Appeal handed down  a decision which the Supreme Court  now supports.  Bias "honestly entertained"  The Appeal Court ruling, penned by  Justice Angelo Branca, stated that  THE AD  THE SUN  REFUSED TO PRINT  Subscriptions to:  |        GAY TIDE  Gay Liberation paper  6. issues for $2.00  % P.O. Box 1463, Stn. A, Vancouver  | V6C 2P7  the Sun had "reasonable cause" to  refuse to provide service to a  specific group because "certain  individuals may have had that bias"  and bias that was 'honestly entertained' can not be 'unreasonable  bias.'  In its nine-page decision, the Supreme Court declared that the Sun  had adopted a position on the controversial subject of homosexuality.  It did not wish to accept an advertisement seeking subscription to a  publication which propagates the  views of the alliance.     Such refusal  was not based upon any personal  characteristic of the person seeking to place that advertisement,  but  upon the content of the advertisement  itself.  Chief Justice Bora Laskin, who dissented from the majority decision  said: Counsel for the Vancouver Sun  would have it that although it could  not discriminate against a person on  the ground that he had only one eye—  that would be a discrimination related to an attribute of the person—  it could refuse an advertisement  soliciting subscriptions to a periodical for the blind because of  newspaper policy against accepting  such an advertisement.  This brings me back to the findings  in this case,  continued the Chief  Justice. They amount to a rejection  of the  Vancouver Sun 's contention  that the refusal of the advertisement  was motivated  (if I may use the  word) by a concern for public decency  or that such a concern had anything  to do with the refusal.     It is,  indeed,  difficult  to square such concern with the various illustrated  advertisements of films which appear  regularly in the Vancouver Sun, advertisements whose occasional vulgarity and offensiveness to decency  were conceded by counsel for the  newspaper.  The   (Human Rights Branch) board of  inquiry was entitled to find as a  fact,  as the majority did,   that the  violation of S.   3 was based on a  bias against homosexuals and homosexuality and that this was not a  reasonable cause... apart from any  question of such bias,   there was no  reasonable cause established to  justify the discrimination.    I can  find no basis on which a court could  or should decide otherwise.  In concurring with the findings of  the Appeal Court, Justice A. Robertson  stated that the GATE advertisement  would offend some of the newspaper's  subscribers,  which in addition  would,  of course,   result in a loss  of subscribers and afford reasonable cause for declining to accept  the business.  In his judgment Justice Laskin responded: If Justice Robertson is  right a person who operates a service or facility customarily available to the public can destroy the  prohibition against denial of its  service,   save for reasonable cause,  by parading his apprehensions that  he will  lose some business.     Moreover,   this would destroy the prohibition not only in respect of a  class of persons such as the appellant association,   (GATE),  but against  a complaining black person or a  Catholic or any other person in the  categories mentioned in Section 3  (2)   (a)  of the Human Rights Code.  'It is not because of their race or  color or religion that we deny our  service ' would be the submission,  'but because of the possible  loss  of customers. '    It is the very kind  of subjective analysis which the  Court of Appeal majority charged  against the board and,  wrongly,  in  my opinion.  Says Flood: Clearly the  law has to  be changed.     Freedom of the press  is a non-issue in this case.     The  centerpiece of our endeavours has  been the push for legal protection  °f gays in every area of life.     It  is our conviction that the eventual  outcome of our present struggle—  whether victory or defeat—will have  a powerful impact not only on gays,  but other minorities and the whole  of society.  Ongoing public struggle  And in defeat, Flood still has this  to say: Fundamentally,   the negative  is perhaps more useful in that it  enables one to better or clearly  understand the necessity of ongoing  public struggle against the courts  and the system.  We take as our own the maxim of the  radical labor movement which is:  don't mourn,  organize. ■ KINESIS JUNE   '79  Responses to elections  In their eagerness to be rid of her,  the Socreds approved the abolition  of her riding. She moved to a new  riding, developed a new constituency  and romped right home.  That's Rosemary Brown, elected May 10  to the legislative assembly in Victoria,  As the strongest, clearest voice for  women's issues in provincial government, we're very pleased she's back.  llso re-elected to Victoria were  NDPers Eileen Dailly, Karen Sanford,  Barbara Wallace and Dennis Cocke, all  of whom have supported VSW's concerns  in particular and women's issues in  general.  The most heartening part of the Federal campaign was hearing Ed Broadbent  describe his party's commitment to  affirmitive action, equal pay for equal work and job training programs for  women. He spoke in the riding of Vancouver East, where Margaret Mitchell,  NDP supporter of women's rights, was  elected.  Mercia Stickney, former staffer at  VSW, was defeated by the P.C. candidate in Richmond-North Delta. Mercia  ran second, beating out the Liberals.  A supporter of women's issues who  was not elected is Judy McManus,  federal NDP candidate in Van. South.  Demanding the right to a choice  How to turn an anti-choice rally into a statement for choice?  The Victoria chapter of CARAL (Canadian Association for the Repeal of  the Abortion Laws) took a good stab  at it on Mothers' Day, May 13.  When the anti-choice after-church  crowd gathered on the steps of the  provincial legislature, CARAL supporters gathered there too.  Stationed a little to one side of the  main gathering, they unfurled their  big pro-choice banner. Anyone sipping  tea in the Empress or running for a  bus might have reasonably concluded  that a pro-choice rally was in full  swing.  This supposition would have been con  firmed had the unsuspecting bystander  walked along the causeway, where CARAL's  Cathy Mountain was busy handing out  pro-choice leaflets.  The most encouraging feature of this  rally,  Mountain told Kinesis, is that  our numbers are up,  while their's are  not.  At a similar gathering one year ago,  pro-choicers numbered only 50.     This  year we are 150 strong.    And that was  just by word of mouth,  Mountain added.  The anti-choice group of about 600 was  no bigger than last year's.  This despite vigorous advertising in Victoria's  dailies.  The ad featured a picture of  a baby captioned: Kill him  (sic) now,  it's called murder;  kill him three  months ago,  it's called abortion. _\  Harassment  stepped  up  Five women were arrested and charged  with soliciting (otherwise known as  street prostitution) two weeks ago  in what has been termed "a vice crackdown" by the Vancouver police.  Prostitutes in Canada, particularly  in Vancouver, have temporarily been  free from police harassment since a  Supreme Court of Canada ruled last  February that a streetwalker must be  "pressing and persistent" in order to  be convicted.  However, Vancouver law enforcement  agenices discovered a way out of the  ruling.  In what has been described  as an adoption of the Toronto vice  squad's method, Vancouver prosecutor  Rose Tweedale explained that a prostitute can be deemed "pressing and  persistent" if she solicits several  clients over a longer period of time.  This argument seems to have worked  successfully in Toronto.  In granting a $500 bail to the five  "women, Provincial Court Judge Nick  Mussalem stipulated that the women  must stay away from the area bounded  by Seymour, Robson, Thurlow and Burrard Inlet between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.  Defence lawyer George Angelomatis  argued against the bail restriction.  He said that the restriction leaves  the prostitutes vulnerable to further  police harassment and arrests since  they can still practise their trade  in other Vancouver streets, like Davie  Lie Detectors used to harass, discriminate  In October, 1978 a woman had her house  broken into and was raped. She had  four children in the house, and fearing harm to those-children, did not  violently resist the rape.  The RCMP were called in to investigate. Fingerprints were obtained  from the window through which the  rapist entered.  After questioning the woman for  approximately four hours, the investigating officers asked her if she would  undergo a polygraph examination.  Claiming that the polygraph exam, also known as the 'lie detector,' is  being used in a discriminatory and  sometimes harassing manner by police,  Vancouver Rape Relief has contacted  the Attorney General of B.C. and the  Solicitor General of Canada demanding  an inquiry into this practice.  Vancouver Rape Relief has found that  in many of our cases rape victims are  asked to submit to the polygraph exam,  said Mary Sims, Rape Relief worker.  When we asked the  Vancouver city police  about the use of lie detectors,  we  WORKIN' WOMEN  IP  were told that the test is only used  when there are conflicting statements  made by the complainant and the alleged  rapist.  However,  in several cases we dealt  with,   the suspects in the crime had  not even been apprehended or questioned when the exam was suggested to the  victim.  Vancouver Rape Relief has made numerous inquiries into police policy  with respect to the use of the polygraph exam only to be told that it  is used at the discretion of the investigating officer and that there  are no further guidelines for its use.  Through the experiences of rape victims and the results of our own research,  we have been forced to conclude that the RCMP and the  Vancouver  city police are discriminating against  complainants of sexual assault through  the use of the polygraph exam,   said  Sims.  The following are evidence of such  discriminatory practice:  In 1976 a report of the Ontario Royal  Commission into Metropolitan Toronto  Police Practices Sergeant Larry Proke  the RCMP senior polygraph operator,  stated that the subject of a polygraph exam is usually A suspect in a  crime or a complainant in a sex offence  and occasionally a witness to a crime.  In a 1979 letter received from the  Vancouver city police Supt. T. Herd-  man stated that, Over the past year  43. 5 per cent of those subjects examined in this type of case   (use of  polygraph in sexual assault cases)  were suspects.     Simple mathematics  shows that the remaining 56.5 per cent  who underwent a lie detector test  were complainants (victims).  We believe,   says Sims^ that it is  procedures such as this one  that make  women hesitate to report their rape.  The practice of using the polygraph  exam on victims of sexual assault  more than on complainants of other  crimes indicates a clear bias and  faulty assumption on the part of the  police that women lie about sexual  assault.'ñ† KINESIS    JUNE  '79    3  B. C. Human Rights Commission  Greedy^commission swallowing branch  Janet Fish  Despite public assurances by Margaret  Strongitharm, chairperson of the  Human Rights Commission, that the  Commission has no desire to take  over the Human Rights Branch, it  appears otherwise.  According to correspondence from  Strongitharm to Kathleen Ruff, Human Rights Branch director, the commission was already trying to take  over the branch and jurisdiction  over Ruff when Strongitharm denied  the reports.  The commission came under heavy attacl  from women's groups and civil rights  associations after making derogatory  statements about women and gays at  its April 3 meeting.  It is made up  of 12 people, 10 men and two women.  Its mandate is to educate the public  on human rights, while the Human  Rights Branch's job is to enforce  the Human Rights Code.  Both are  under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor, Allan Williams.  Formerly they were considered separate entities under one roof.  Ignorant, callous attitude  When the commission was put under  pressure to answer for remarks made  at the April meeting, more statements issued revealing the ignorant  and often callous attitude some members have toward minority groups  and women.  Rev. Neil Vant told reporters that  homosexuals "prey on others" when  they do not have fellow homosexuals  to deal with.  The Reverend, a commission member from 100-Mile House,  feels that discrimination of homosexuals is justified. When questioned  later, Ruff said the branch would  take action on discrimination cases  against homosexuals.  The commission finally decided to  issue a "clarifying" statement after  a month of strong public protest  which included picketting a law  seminar attended by commission members and also the commission's regular monthly meeting.  After an in-camera session May 1,  Strongitharm restated that the commission had no intention of taking  over the branch.  The press release states:  Subsequent to the April meeting,  there was a statement in the press  to  the effect that the commission was  seeking—directly or indirectly— to  constrain the freedom of speech of  the director of the Human Rights  Branch.     There is no substance to  this allegation.     The commission's  staff includes a Chief Executive  Officer  (Kathleen Ruff).    In order  that the commission perform in  accordance with its mandate,  it must  use all resources available to it,  which resources include the services  of the Chief Executive Officer.  There is an anomaly and confusion in  the role of this officer;  at the  moment she reports not to the commission,  but to the deputy minister  of labor in her capacity as director  of the Human Rights Branch....upon  occasion there can be conflict and  confusion of the two functions.   This  is a state of affairs the commission  has sought and will seek to remedy.  Before this statement had even been  circulated, a lttter to Ruff dated  March 23 from Strongitharm, totally  contradicts the later release.  The three-page letter found its way  to the press after the Civil Liberties Association uncovered it.  Ruff under commissioners  In this letter Strongitharm, in no  uncertain terms, relays a commission  motion which, in effect, puts Ruff  directly under the commission's  sole power.  In the second paragraph Strongitharm  says,  As background to the motion let me  explain that the commission was grappling with its relationship to yourself as Chief Executive Officer of  the commission.    The commission can  find no authority for the establishment of a Human Rights Branch reporting to  the Deputy Minister Labor.     Under the Human Rights Code  the Director is Chief Executive Officer of the Commission  (S.   12  (2)  (a).     Usually a Chief Executive Officer would report to and take direction from the body of which she is  the Executive Officer.  She would be  responsible to and accountable to  that body,  and would implement the  motions passed by that body.  There appears to be no authority for  the creation of a branch separate  from the commission in the Ministry  of Labor Act.     The commission is unaware of any other legislation which  may be authority for the present  administrative structure wherein the  Director and staff appointed to carry  out duties under the code report to  the Deputy Minister of Labor.  Under the previous code,   the Director  reported to the .Ministry of Labor (see  the definition section),     It would  appear that when the new Human Rights  Code was proclaimed,   the old structure  was not re-aligned to conform with  the new legislation.  Completely contradictory  Strongitharm then goes on to detail  what the commission wants Ruff to do  for them in the way of check-up work  on the boards of inquiry and "to refrain from making any statement to  the media on any matters that may  come before the commission or a board  of inquiry."  It is hard not to conclude that the  commission has the same disregard  for truth as it does for human rights.  Strongitharm was issuing statements  on radio and television which were  in direct opposition to written correspondence by herself representing  the commission's motion.  While Allan Williams commented briefly  on the commission before being reelected in West Vancouver, he has  kept conspicuously silent on this  latest travesty.  Hugh Curtis, before re-election, said  that he was not happy with the commission, and did not like the fact that  the commission had told Ruff to keep  quiet. I think some of the commissioners  should be changed,  he told Stephen  Hume, Colonist reporter. Some of the  commissioners have shown remarkable  insensitivity,  he added.  Now he's back in power, what is he  going to do about the commission?  Write to him at the Parliament Buildings  Victoria B.C. demanding a response'.    i  VSW AGM  The Annual General Meeting of the  Vancouver Status of Women will be  held on Wednesday, June 13 at 7:30  p.m. at the Kitsilano Public Library  (8th and MacDonald).  Included on the agenda are elections  for the executive for the coming  year, constitutional amendments,  the annual report of our year's  activities and the screening of  films produced by local feminists.  ■ 4      KINESIS JUNE   '79  HERSTORY  Building wisdom from our foremothers  The Women's Building at the corner of Thurlow and Robson, 1927. It's now Oil Can Harry's, a nightclub.  Gillian Marie  In Toronto the Women's Building is  a very exclusive club located at  Twenty-one McGill Street. The initial membership fee stands at $1,100.  In Winnipeg the recently-opened  Women's Building seems to provide a  roof for women's groups and individual crafts women.  In Los Angeles the Women's Building  is a multi-level multi-faceted concept, large enough to encompass the  needs of many women in and out of  the women's movement.  Here in Vancouver we are in the process of forming a Women's Building  Trust to lay the ground work for our  own building—using the free shares  that the provincial government is  doling out to residents of B.C. as  collateral.  We are presently formulating our  image of what the women's building  will be and, as is my bent, I searched out historical examples.  We're not the first in B.C.  It may not come as a surprise to  learn that this will not be the first  women-owned and women-controlled  building in the province.  The idea and the need for such a  building was recognised by Vancouver  women prior to the First World War.  The early feminists who were 'involved  in a multiplicity of clubs and organizations felt a very real need to  have a place of their own to control.  Tired of finding their usual meeting  places appropriated, they co-operated  on a project of forming a company,  the Vancouver Women's Building Ltd.  The company sold common shares at  $25 each, payable in a lump sum or  in $2.50 monthly instalments. These  shares were sold to public-minded  societies and individuals. The  appeal was wide—the purpose of the  company was to provide a home for  societies involved in patriotic and  philanthropic services.  It was Helen Gregory MacGill who  did much of the organizational work  to get this project off the ground.  The women came from the wealthy and  influential class in Vancouver, women who were concerned about the  poverty and sordid conditions in  which hundreds of women and children  lived. They worked to improve the  lot of women and children through  their middle-class organizations.  They sought legislative changes  such as the franchise, equal guardianship of infants, mother's pensions, juvenile courts, the adoption  act, raising the age of marriage to  16 years from 12 years for females,  a protection of wives act, minimum  wage legislation and social change.  They had great faith in the legislative process and in the humanizing  role that they believed women's  votes would have on government policy.  The Women's Building was a central  location for these groups who were  as diverse as the Business & Professional Women's Club, the Girls'  Hospital Auxiliary and the Women's  Christian Temperance Union.  Small house at 752 Thurlow  Initially the small house at 752  Thurlow Street, bought in 1911,  housed women's organizations, the  city creche (for the children of  working mothers) and during the war,  women's patriotic associations.  As more societies used the building,  increasing energy went into fund  raising to pay off the mortgage.  On March 19, 1913 The Vancouver Sun  issued a special edition on women.  Women from the various organizations  around town contributed to the copy,  secured the advertising and sold the  papers on the street. This fund-  raising scheme made a handsome profit. The edition was sold from  Alaska to St. John.  Along the same lines, between 1924-  and 1942 fund raisers put out a  pocket-size Directory of Vancouver ► KINESIS JUNE  '79  Women's Associations and diary containing lists of women's societies  and lodges: public health and child  welfare organizations; educational,  patriotic and peace associations;  and clubs connected with the fine  arts.  Counter-posed are advertisements placed by women piano or voice  teachers and the more general ads  for household items such as vacuum  cleaners: "The Hoover is a tireless  servant. Ready at any moment to  clean for you."  Other fund raising schemes included  a 1922 Souvenir Book of Women's  Societies in the city; the appearance of the ballerina Pavlova at  the Empress Theatre and the Living  Whist Card game in magnificently-  costumed players.  By 1926, the mortgage on the building was paid off and sufficient new  funds had been raised to lay the  corner-stone of a new three story  cement structure. This was opened  on Sept. 30, 1926, by the woman  mayor of Seattle.  The new building contained a banquet  room seating 300, an auditorium for  500 with a concert piano, stage and  fireplace, a lodge, committee rooms  and an executive parlour. The  twenties seem to have been the most  active years for the building, with  an average of 157 meetings being  held every month within its various  committee rooms. Lectures on a  variety of topics—from the "Buy  in B.C." campaign (to teach housekeepers to recognize and buy B.C.  grown products) to courses in public  speaking and civics — raised more  funds for the building.  The depression of the thirties led  to the establishment of courses in  waitressing for destitute unemployed  young women.  The building facilities  were used by the Vancouver Symphony  orchestra and other outside organizations. However, therental income  declined, and by 1933 the company  had difficulty meeting its obligations.  By 1940 the war made it impossible  to raise funds.  The building was  sold to the Salvation Army for use  as a soldiers' hostel. For the want  of $1,500 in back taxes the keys of  the Vancouver Women's Building were  passed over to the Salvation Army.  The "total war" effort drained'women's energy and funds away from the  women's building.  Thus, the first women's building in  Vancouver (and possibly Canada)  closed its doors although the property-less Vancouver Women's Building Ltd. continued social service  work in rented offices at Woodwards  Store on Hastings. Work was centered around the war effort.  The priorities of this early group  of women were: social service work,  education, fostering the fine arts,  cultivating patriotism and world  peace and, in the words of the New  Year's Resolutions for 1925, "to  develop sisterliness."  Today we may disagree with some of  their aims and/or methods by which  they sought to better the lot of  women. But we must admire their  tenacity and their ability to persuade other women of the feasibility  of owning their own building during  an era when as married women, they  did not even have the legal right  to control their persons, children  or property. We can also appreciate  their cooperative spirit and their  vision of a materially better society  for women.  I think we can learn from our fore-  mothers.  I hope that, like its pre  decessor, the women's building of  the '80s contains office space for  women's groups working for social  change for women. We also need a  cultural space, and a building large  enough to house a good-sized auditorium so that we no longer have to  pay high rents for our benefits and  concerts.  I hope that we can provide a restaurant and meeting place  for women and daycare for our children.  If you want this vision of a women's  building to become a reality, come  to the open meeting at Britannia Community Centre on June 10, room L3  at 7:30 p.m.  To make it happen we need you, your  interest and your pledged shares and  donations.■  Women gaining clear voice in  student movement  On Tuesday, May 8, the first national conference for women post-secondary students was held at the University of British Columbia.  The conference was sponsored by the  National Union of Students and pre-  ceeded the NUS Annual General Meeting, May 9-13.  The conference grew out of a move  by women delegates to the 1978 NUS  fall conference in London, Ontario  to formalize the organization's  recognition of the^particular problems of women in colleges, vocational institutes and universities.  Financial barriers discussed  The day began with a plenary session followed by simultaneous workshops on financial barriers to women  in education. Specific areas discussed included student financial  aid, unemployment and childcare. The  current trend to cutbacks in education generally is simply worsening  women's already disadvantaged position.  In the area of financial  assistance, for example, "cutbacks in  adult retraining allowances have  effectively blocked access for the  women most in need of the program.  Changes in unemployment insurance  criteria similarly penalize women,  already ghettoized into low paid,  insecure jobs even when we can find  work.  It was noted that the federal  government is effectively masking  the severity of the problem by its  refusal to break down statistics on  student employment by sex.  Other sessions dealt with problems  faced by women having reached post-  secondary institutions.  Cutbacks  in women's studies programs, the  streaming of women into traditional  programs and the particular problems  of part time students (the vast  majority of whom are women) were  among the topics discussed.  In addition, delegates in smaller groups  discussed the means of organizing  and maintaining women's centres on  campus.  Sexual harassment of women students  Sexual harassment faced by women as  students and workers was the theme  of the keynote address given by Debra  Lewis of VSW. She pointed out that  such harassment effectively cuts  across women's educational, economic  and sexual independence. She outlined the myths surrounding sexual  harassment and placed the responsibility for its existence in women's  historical status as forms of private  property. Only when women translate  their individual experience into  collective action can we begin to  take control over our own lives.  She urged women to publicize the  existence of harassment on campus  and provide a secure place for women to discuss their experiences,  gain support and confront the issue  collectively.  Ongoing steering committee  In the evening, the final plenary  session discussed strategies for advancing the position of women in  education. Recommendations, later  endorsed by the NUS conference as a  whole, included the creation of an  ongoing steering committee, development of a "Declaration of Rights of  the Woman Student" and the holding  of similar women's conferences before each NUS conference in October  and May.  Reactions to the conference were  very positive. Women have been  able to prepare themselves for the  issues that will be raised in the  NUS conference such as accessibility  and unemployment,   said NUS researcher  Morna Ballantyne. It has definitely  increased the number of women participating in the NUS conference.  Approximately 50 women (about one  third of the total) attended the conference, double the usual participation rate.  Jean Bennett, B.C. NUS Central Committee member added, It gave women  new to NUS and the student movement  a chance to come forward and articulate their concerns in a large group.  It seems clear that women can and  do participate in building the student movement when it is clear that  their concerns as women are finally  being taken seriously. This conference was a positive beginning. ■ KINESIS    JUNE   '79  BODY IMAGE  Looksism is an issue for the feminist community  Janice Pentland-Smith  The term "Looksism" might be new but  the experience of being judged by  appearance is common to all of us.  Outside the feminist community women  are constantly bombarded with visual  images defining a narrow range of  "looks" which are considered attractive, and therefore acceptable for  women.  Women are judged by men and by each  other on their ability to achieve a  proximity in dress, body shape and  size, and even "personality" to the  latest male defined standards of  womanhood.  The standards change constantly and  women devote large amounts of time,  energy and money in an attempt to  keep pace with the definition of  "today's woman."  Feminists in their analysis of the  role of appearance in our society  have become aware of the origins  and functions of the standards of  femininity set for women. They are  also aware of the financial and  emotional drain that adherence to  these standards has on women.  The latest "look," artificially  manufactured by the clothing and  cosmetic industries serves to support  an economic system in which women  must be made to feel inadequate if  fhey don't keep up with changing  styles as constant consumption of  products is necessary to the industry's survival.  It is not difficult for the image  makers to create new "needs". The  complicated socialization of women  into their second claTS status ensures that few women have the self  confidence to ignore the pressure  to conform.  Elite exhibits "good" taste  The message given to women is not  of course blatant. Conformity is  out at present and many mass-produced  articles are sold with the message  that the buyers can show by their  creativity, their individuality, or  the face that they are part of a  small elite which exhibits the "good"  taste that only purchasers of product  X are blessed with.  While most women realize that personal qualities such as integrity  and honesty are the important qualities in human relationships they"  also know from first hand exerpience  that the superficiality of appearance  is usually the primary criterion for  male approval.  Many of the changes in appearance for  women are directly linked to the needs  for workers of business and industry.  This demand for women in the work  force goes beyond defining appearance  as any history of the role of women in  war time industries and in the workforce of the 1950's will show.  The needs of business and industry  Business and industry join together to  decide what "type" of woman is needed.  These decisions are reinforced by  the media. The "look" of the 1980's  is extreme. Many women's journals  are showing clothes for the new woman  executive.  Considering the limited  number of women who fill executive  positions, you might wonder, who  is  buying these clothes?  You might also wonder if this is an  attempt to have us believe that women  have made real gains in the workforce.  I don't know anyone who fits the executive image so that's the look for  the rest of us? Well, Ms. magazine  describes it as a "look" for the unemployed of the 1980's. The latest  styles, as exemplified by the disco  look, are a return to the "Fifi La  Femme" image of the past. At worst  it trivializes women by defining them  once again as primarily sex objects.  The media is attempting to legitimize  this "new" view of women by using  authors who describe themselves as  feminists to support the idea that  having achieved equality it's okay  for women to return to using their  greatest asset - sexuality.  (See  Dec. 1978 Esquire magazine "The  Year of the Lusty Woman.")  It would take a far stretch of the  Imagination to think that women will  be taken seriously wearing the high  heel shoes, make up, and slit-to-the  thigh dresses thax are shown in this  month's Chatelaine.

One woman writes about that most insidious form of looksism - the compliment. Why, she asks, is it so  important for us to get approval for  our appearance from those we care  about? I was surprised to find the  compliment included in the list but  it bears consideration.  A large part of this Out and About  issue on Locksism deals with FAT.  The publication of Susie Orbach's  book Fat is a Feminist Issue (Pad-  dington Press) has helped to legitimize what is seen primarily as a  woman's "probiem."  Being a fat woman in our society is  one of the most oppressive experiences  for a woman.  The majority of women  spend large amounts of time and energy thinking about food and fatness.  Feminists seem to have varying responses to the issue of fat.  One is  the response of the Californian group  to "Fat Underground".  Their slogan,  "FAT PEOPLE OF THE WORLD UNITE, YOU  HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE..." explains  their position.  Feminists who subscribe to this view  are organizing to demand proper  health care. Fat people find that  regardless of their problems, physical or psychological, these are al-  As feminists we have long ago given up being influenced  by patriarchal definitions of women and no longer  judge each other by appearance. Is this in fact true?  definitions of women and no longer  judge each other by appearance. Is  this in fact xrue?  Apparently not. Out and About,  Seattle's lesbian feminist newsletter  devoted their February issue to  Looksism in the feminist community.  In several articles women described  common experiences where they have  felt judged by other women on the  basis of their "looks."  Here are some examples:  "'.., how about the time when my   'more  attractive ' friend and I get into a  conversation with a man and he talks  to her even when he's answering a  question I asked—and she doesn 't  say anything about it?  ...or when my   'more attractive'   (and  thinner) fri,end sees her reflection  in a store window and says  :'you know,  I really should lose some weight."  (Not I want to but I should).  ...a more subtle example is the woman who talks about being too fat  and is going to go on a diet.. she  will probably, if challenged,  say  she doesn't think it's bad for  others to be fat, just that she feels  better about herself when she 's  thinner.  ...remarks made to a short woman about  her size do not convey    information  she doesn't already know and in fact  they hurt..."  ways interpreted as being caused by  excess weight. Several women wrote  that they are fed up with being told  "if you would only lose weight then...  would happen." (fill in the blank)  Only the young, and the thin  As feminists, do we attempt to deal  with overeating by examining the  stresses that lead us to deal with  stress by eating? Or do we refuse  to accept the standards of attractiveness that leave room only for  the young and thin? Many women, as  they enter middle age are not thin  and need to diet to maintain weight  easily held in their early twenties.  At what point are we overweight?  Any discussion of this issue confirms my belief that fat is a feminist issue along with all the other  issues which fall into the bag dealt  with by "Looksism".  It's not difficult to find examples  of Looksism both outside and inside  the feminist community.  I can't  make up my mind whether spending energy examining my own attitudes is  going to be beneficial as I find the  issue confusing and difficult to get  a handle on. Should I put my energy  elsewhere?  Can feminists afford not to deal with  an issue that affects us all? Kinesis  would like your opinions. We would  also like your examples and experiences. ■ KINESIS JUNE   '79  BODY IMAGE  Losing the Battle of Longline Ridge  Gail Borst  I have body scars from battles I lost  in a war I fought until I was 25 years  old.  In chronological order, the  two battles are: The Battle of Numb  Feet 1955-1961, and the Battle of  Longline Ridge 1960-1967.  There were two kinds of'acceptable  shoes in my school: heels - which  were pointy-toed and high and which  were always worn on state occasions  and never to school, and flats -  thin, no heeled ballet-shoe types  which were worn to classes.  Saddle  shoes were for cheerleading and runners for gym, period. Any other  shoes made you a drip.  "Make your legs look sexy. . ."  Heels, "which make your legs look  sexy and your walk graceful," mash  my toes into the front of the shoe.  In my era the front was a sharp rigid  V with the shoes made from hard,  unbreathing, unbending vinyl plastic.  What circulation survived the mash  was eliminated by the constant jar  of the ball of the foot on the pavement. By the end of the day there  was little feeling left.  It was dangerous too, if not impossible, for me to remove my shoes before I was safely home for the day.  I remember going on a day outing  with my church group. Touring a  church, lunch and then a TV show  was the agenda.  During the show  I made the mistake of slipping my  shoes off my burning feet. By the  end of the show my feet, not yet  beaten into submission, had swelled  to twice their normal size and could  not be jammed back into my shoes.  Mortified, I had to be hauled home  by relays of strong-armed friends.  "So neat and ladylike. . ."  Flats too, contributed their share  to my feet's numbness and misery.  Flats, "so neat and ladylike with  skirts," came in most colors, black  the most common, and different styles  succeeded one another in acceptabil-*  ity. While all styles had in common  their thinness—cold and wet in winter, sometimes disintegrating, hot  and sticky dirty from the pavement  in summer—and their little girl-  ness—the Alice In Wonderland look,  one style was the quintessence of  both.  It was black.  It was thin.  It was  shiny and rounded. It was a vision  of age seven patent leather and it  had a strap across the instep. The  strap, unfortunately, was elastic,  tight elastic which did not stretch.  It put a tourniquet 10 hours a day  across the nerves running down my  foot. It took about a year and a  half to get any feeling back in my  big toes.  (But I did have acceptable shoes on).  Most of the numbness passed off in  the five or six years after grade 12  but some remains.  The circulation  is still bad in my feet, and they  are seldom warm.  The feeling I remember most from  that time was frustration that I  couldn't wear those adorable styles.  Obviously, I didn't learn too much  because right about that time began  the Battle of Longline Ridge on  another battlefield altogether.  My family has a pattern of being  overweight. More specifically, we  female settle our weight into our  rounded asses, massive thighs and  pudgy calves. When we are thinner,  that area appears maybe a bit mis-  proportioned, but when we gain weight,  oh, my!  We feel guilty and embarassed about  this quality of our weight, and have  been known to whisper to one another  that our upper halves are okay, if  paradise.  If I sat injudiciously in  a tight sheath skirt, the girdle leg  showed white below my skirt hem. But  a bit more immobility took care of  that.  Knees kept together, move unforce-  fully, sit very slowly. More ladylike behavior. Also, under pants,  there tended to be a bulge at the  knee—maybe I could find that longer  girdle if I kept looking.  Not to mention the itch, the heat,  the broken finger nails, or the  trouble when I finally had to head  for the toilet.  But I was happy.  Encased muscles do not move  What I didn't realize though, was  how the girdle affected my body.  Muscles encased like that do not  move and what muscle tone they once  had, they lose.  Thighs especially  on me got floppier and bulgy-er,  necessitating tighter girdles.  Eventually, wearing the girdle created  a ridge several inches above my knees,  the difference between the muscles  under the girdle and those outside  it. Years later, that ridge is still  very visible.  And the difference in the way the  two sections feel when I touch them  is amazing.  The muscles in other  parts of my body tone up relatively  easily when I exercise, but there it  takes heroic effort and usually I  don't succeed.  That section of my  body still has less feeling and looks  unrelated to the rest.  I still want to disown it and like it  less than the rest of my body.  I  have had some lower back pain and  now some knee trouble and I'm beginning to wonder about the connections .  These are two of the physical scars  These are two of the physical scars on my body gotten in  a war I didn't start and couldn 't win. It is a war that we  are plunged into when we're born female.  only we could get rid of the bottom  part. And, with my mother's wholehearted support, that is precisely  what I tried to do.  One of the happiest days of my life  was when I discovered a longline girdle. '  The pink cotton panty-girdle I had  had to hold up my stockings had done  nothing for my "problem," but this  did.  It was thick and white and  rubbery.  It looked like it meant  business, and it enclosed me from  waist to knee.  I stuffed myself into it and it rigidified that most  troublesome and ugly part of my body.  It forced me Into the proper shape.  I was smooth from waist to knee.  Nothing bulged. Nothing moved. I  felt free. It was cut off, controlled  and I could pretend it didn't exist.  No one would notice it anymore.  I had even heard tell of a girdle  that encased one from waist to ankle -  my God, how wonderful! But our local  stores didn't carry it and I never  did find one. Just think, safety and  conformity from ankle to waist.  Of course, there were a few flies in  on my body gotten in a war I didn't  start and couldn't win. It is a  war that we are plunged into when  we're born female.  I have other  physical scars too, numbness on my  head from sleeping on hard, pink,  pastic hair rollers and permanent  itchy places on my back where bra  straps crossed.  I never put all  these together before - so many  places on my body that were unacceptable, or acceptable only under certain conditions and so many places  now numb or reduced in feeling.   ■  month's offensive ad.

Fashion writers,  who are  good at snappy shorthand,  have explained it in a phrase -   "retro  fashion."    That's retro as in retrograde,  retrogressive.  Retro fashion tips its tiny hat to  the 1940's,  but mainly it honors  the anti-feminist fifties when men  were men and women were tied in  knots.  Ms,  April  1979.

"  For example, women's bodies are  considered sexy,  sick,  evil, weak,  filthy and sacred.     The media create  the ideal woman as physically flawless, mentally vacant, and emotionally a child.

An unidentified Sikh doctor described  the death of Harjit Kaur Bhuller Brar,  32, and her four daughters, as a Punjabi cultural bias which can be understood only if one knows the prejudice  against girls phenomenon within East  Indian cultures.  A five-year-old son died from cancer  a few years ago, and Mrs. Brar had  been grief-stricken since, according  to Rajinder Sidhu, a friend of the  deceased. She had therefore longed  for another son and was extremely  disappointed when the fourth child  turned out to be another girl.

This meant women's average  wage dropped to only 53 per cent of  men's average pay.  Federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent also  spoke to the conference and received  a standing ovation when he re-affirmed  the party's program for the equality  of working women.  All delegates were able to attend the  "Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value"  workshop, where some women brought  up problems encountered with various  job evaluation programs.

The guidelines introduced by Aid. Ann  Blough present criteria for counselling  women with "troubled pregnancies" and  stipulate that counsellors must outline all alternatives to each woman.  While Aid. Blough claims that her concern is for a "middle of the line"  approach to abortion, she adds,  Agencies should talk more about adoption.    There are 204 families in Calgary waiting for aboptions right now.  I'm not trying to hang a guilt trip  on girls,  but giving a child up for  adoption is the  least selfish thing  a person can do.  The use of the word "fetus" can cloud  the issue in a counselling situation,  says Blough.

The night of Jan. 26, 1979, Mike  MacDonald at Metro Media was busy .  taping the news shows out of Seattle  to get all he could on the sentencing  of close to 200 persons in the U.S.  federal court for trespassing on the  Bangor Nuclear Submarine base in May  1978.  The night before in Vancouver, we had  gathered at Metro Media which is also  the home of Pacific Life Community,  for the send off party for about 20  of those Canadians who had disobeyed  the U.S. federal law last May by  occupying the Bangor base. -Their  occupation had said to the world,  Stop  the Trident Sub,   stop  the arms  race,   It's up to us,   and had called  for support of the U.N. Special Session  on Disarmament happening in New York  at that moment.  Contained in that news was a short  clip.  It was a plea by the Union of  Concerned Scientists to the U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission to shut  down immediately several highly dangerous nuclear energy plants in the  U.S.  One of them was the Three Mile  Island facility near Harrisburg, Penn.  Silkwood trial ends in victory  That trial in Seattle is over, but  many other trials and anti-nuclear  actions continue.  In the federal  courthouse in Oklahoma City, on March  6, 1979, lawyers for the estate of  Karen Silkwood brought suit against  Kerr-McGee Corporation, the country's  largest uranium producer and pioneer  in the plutonium field, suing the  company for negligence in the safety  of workers at their processing plant  allowing them to be contaminated by  deadly plutonium.  On May 17, the court announced that  Kerr-McGee had indeed been negligent.  The Silkwood estate, which had brought  the charge against the multinational,  was awarded 10.5 million dollars. Lawyer for the Silkwoods, Gerry Spence,  says that the judgment puts the  whole nuclear industry on notice.  This could prove to be one of history's  most important trials. Winning the negligence suit opens the whole industry  and government to public and private  suits.  Silkwood supporters will now proceed to  a second trial, involving the conspiracy of the company to impede Karen's  right to free access to the roads.  The implication is clear: murder.  Was Karen Silkwood murdered?  Karen Silkwood died in a car accident  in 1974.  She was carrying documents  that were to prove that Kerr-McGee  made faulty fuel rods, and in the  process of handling plutonium lost  many pounds of the horrible powder  in various ways, some perhaps to the  international black market for bomb  grade plutonium.  Karen never got to the authorities.  Even now as the partially melted  core of the reactor at Three Mile  Island cools and the managers, Metropolitan Edison, decide whether to  clean up the highly radioactive mess  or just bury it in concrete, (and'  raise customers' rates to pay for it  all), the nuclear industry is preparing to bounce back with promises  of total safety with the full support  of President Carter, himself an old  nuclear engineer.  Real threats in B.C. coming up  Here in B.C. this is a very real  threat to us. We may be successful  in stopping the Socred and Hydro  plans to build nuclear power reactors  on the Island at Crofton (near Victoria) and False Head and Port McNeill  (to the north of Vancouver Island),  land).  To that end the Lasquiti people are  fighting to keep the high power transmission lines from defiling their  lovely island.  But the uranium multi-nationals are  ready to mine B.C. as soon as the  Royal Commission of Inquiry into  Uranium Mining, chaired by Dr. David  V. Bates, gives them the okay.

Linklater, a 23-year-old Yukon Indian  woman from the traditional native village of Old Crow, was married to a  man who beat her until she couldn't  stand it any longer.  At the Yukon Supreme Court trial in  Whitehorse this spring, the defense  urged the jury to bring in a verdict  of manslaughter. Linklater's action  was the culmination of a marriage of  drunkeness'and violence, defense argued.  But within three hours the jury had  found her guilty of second degree murder.  The sentence: life imprisonment.  For 23 years, Kristine Linklater has  Mved the northern way of life in an  isolated Indian village.  Now she is  to be packed off to Kingston, leaving  a newborn baby behind.  It will be  ten years before she is eligible for  parole.  She did not mean to kill her husband,  Linklater told the court. She had  meant to kill herself in her husband's  presence,,she added. She had not  wanted to drink on the night before  the shooting, but her husband had  talked her into it. She and three  others consumed three bottles of  whiskey before she had gone to bed.  She was awoken by her husband beating  her. He was accusing her of having  hidden his beer.  Her alcohol reading at the time of  the killing was estimated to be around  0.19. The Crown, however, asked the  jury to convict her of murder on the  grounds that she had been aware of  what she was doing when she fired the  gun.  The all-white jury agreed  The six-person jury was composed entirely of Caucasian city dwellers.  The judge was white, the prosecutor  was white, the defense attorney was  white, the policemen and women were  white.  Reports say that Linklater's voice  was often barely audible in the courtroom and that the Old Crow witnesses  were often asked to speak up.  Compare the life imprisonment sentence  for Kristine Linklater with the following report from the Vancouver Sun,  July 13, 1978:  Ernest Riggs,   52,  was sentenced today  to 21 months in prison and two years  probation for beating his wife,  Eleanor\  to death last August.  B.C.  Supreme Court Justice James MacDonald accepted the report that Riggs  "was drunk beyond control" on August  2,   1977,. "so that he hardly knows  what happened. "  Justice MacDonald said,   however,   that  all drunkeness does is reduce the  killing of a person to manslaughter  but it does not excuse it. ■  Pacific Life open letter  against the 148 rather than lose the  case.

Richmond women open new centre  Ces Rosa les  The building has been doomed in the  last ten years. Rat poison is stored  in the back - along with bicycles  that are to be auctioned off by the  Richmond police.  Nevertheless  this still is the safest  place around that women can go  to,  says Naomi Lis, one of eight to ten  women who are collectively looking  after the Richmond Women's Resources  Centre (RWRC) in its new home.  Located directly behind the Richmond  Municipal Hall, the n -it  centre was  once the Old Fire Hall.  It's fast becoming the hub of activities for women in and around Richmond  since it opened in the early part of  last month.  This centre is for women  to drop-in,  'rest and be  themselves,   says Lis.  We also have ongoing programs  like  workshops in assertiveness  training,  consciousness raising and Wen-do  self-defense.     The centre gives  that  space for self-discovery,   self-help  and mutual support.  The RWRC which started in July 1976  and operated on a part-time basis out  .of the South Arm United Church, also  provides information and resource  services.  We attempt very seriously to work to  make the general public more aware  of the concerns of women through our  publicity and also through participating in such community organizations  as the Richmond Community Services  Council,   continued Lis.  We work to take concrete action where  we sense a real need and are presently  actively represented on the Emergency  Shelter  (Transition House)  Committee  of the Chimo Crisis Centre and on the  Child Abuse Advisory Committee.  We are also one of the founding  groups on the Richmond Family Place  Committee which has received its grant  and should be seeing its project underway in the near future.  The value and importance of the RWRC  seems to have been officially recognized when the Richmond Council, with  the representation of Corisande Per-  cival-Smith, approved the opening of  the lower section of the Old Fire  Hall for their indefinite use.  Some people say the upper section of  this hall is haunted,   quipped Lis,  however whoever or whatever it is,  it seems to have empathy with women.

The  company, Placer Development Ltd., has  had the support of the RCMP in shipping out the molybdenum from behind  the picket lines.  ASPEN, the newsletter of the Northern  Network Committee, published by the  Prince George Women's Equal Rights  Association, spoke with women of Fraser Lake. Here, they comment on how  they feel about police support for  the company's strike-breaking activities and how the strike is affecting  their lives.  Fraser Lake is becoming a ghost-town.  Men are  leaving homes and families  to  seek jobs elsewhere.     The town,  what  is left of it,  is being split because  of the strike.     What a gut-wrenching  feeling as families watched their  bread and butter rolling down the highway in guarded convoys!    Women who  believe in their husbands ' right to  ask for a decent living wage demonstrating peacefully and being attacked  by guard dogs!    The positive feelings  of togetherness are strong as we are  all united in the same problems of  the everyday struggle for human dignity.  Being the wife of a miner gets very  depressing,  sometimes I just don't  know what to do when my husband is  feeling down.     I get to feel the same  way and then both of us are upset and  there just doesn't seem to be anything  we can do about it.     I was part of  I've never seen a community  up in arms like this before  the peaceful demonstration that was  held by the women of Fraser Lake and  when I saw the 22 trucks come down  the road I felt alone and lost and  I felt like crying and screaming at  the same time.     Personally I hope  this strike is over soon because I  feel that I can't take much more 'of  this.  It's so hard trying to keep my spirits  up while trying to keep my husband  cheered up.     I get such feelings of  frustration when I see those damn convoy trucks guarded by the RCMP.    All  the miners are asking for is a decent  living wage.     I get so angry over a  company who tries to justify making  millions of dollars profit and can't  pay decent wages.    After all,  our  husbands helped make that money.     We  might do without a lot of things but  I will back my husband all the way.  I've never seen a community up in arms  like this before.     I've lived here  for 14 years.  The 500 Endako workers are members of  the Canadian Association of Industrial,  Mechanical and Allied Workers (CAIMAW).  Main issue in the strike is wages.  While workers in the forest industry  receive between $8 and $10 an hour,  miners' wages range from $6 to $9 an  hour.  Very few of the women have waged work  as there is little secondary industry  in Fraser Lake. ■ KINESIS JUNE  '79    13  You Can't Scare Me. .'I'm Stickin' to the Union  Union Women in British Columbia  during the Great Depression  Background  The experience of women within the  trade union movement and as workers  facing exploitation within their work  places must be approached from the  double location of women's experience  within capitalist society.  Women play the central role within the  home in reproducing labor power, but  also play a role as wage laborers.  These two distinct functions developed  for Canadian, working class women with  the industrialization of the Canadian  economy.  Previous to this,  the family, despite _  the sexual division of labor within  it, served as a basic production unit.  With the development of capitalism,  the production of goods and services  was brought outside the home and socialized.  Women continued to play the key role  in- domestic production: childrearing;  (daughters as well as mothers participated in this); maintenance of the  home,   cooking,   cleaning:  facilitating  the daily and generational reproduction of labor power.  In periods of economic expansion, women were drawn out of the home and  integrated into production, only to  be released again with the decline  in production.    This occurred on both  a seasonal and cyclical basis.     The  central position of women on the labor market became that of a   'reserve  army of labor'.  A small  layer of women worked .permanently until they married.    The jobs  available to women outside of the home  were extensions of their work within  the family.     Women's affinity for  such work was perceived as natural.  Thus'women worked in  laundries,  restaurants,  schools,  in food production,  and as domestics.  Women's work within the family was  unpaid and seen as non-productive  and unskilled.    Thus,   these categories were relatively devalued within the labor market.    Both male and  female attitudes towards women's  labor were moulded by this distorted  reality.     The right of women to employment outside the home was thus,  continually,  challenged, by both objective, pressures and the dominant  ideology.  Discussion of working class women  must move into a general discussion,  of working class experience at this  time,  despite the divisions of the  proletariat along sexual  lines.  The brutal economic and social attacks  on working women in the 1930's were  often experienced by other vulnerable  sectors   (youth,   immigrants) and were  translated into a challenge to  the  rights of all workers,  both skilled  and unskilled.     Divisions along organizational and ideological  lines  within the working class in response  to  these attacks swept along working  class women as well as men.  The polarization between craft and  industrial unionism,  between revolutionary and reformist consciousness;  and between business and political  ►  (Ed.note: for important background  material for this article,   see the  sidebar  (in italics),  which runs in  the outside columns.)  By 1939 there were 1,121 organized  women workers in B.C., out of a female working population of approximately 26,000.  Although small in  numbers, these women made a significant contribution to both the trade  union movement and to the general  spirit of working class combativity  of the 1930's.  The constraints on organizing  The position of women in the labor  force created objective constraints  on organization. TJomen were temporary, seasonal and part-time workers.  Women often worked in individual  households or cottage industry.  The  superexploitation of women's labor  power created special needs (minimum  wages and conditions), issues which  skilled tradesmen had long resolved.  The primary role which women played  in the family at times made it difficult for them to play more of a  role in union work.  Attitudes surrounding 'feminine' behavior created additional barriers.  A central obstacle against female  union activity was the disinterest  in the organization of working women  shown by the labor movement.  Many  unionists believed that women were  'backwards'.  Essential elements which could interest and facilitate women's unionization were lacking (childcare was  not provided for meetings, women's  rights were reduced to general union  rights).  Once women became active, they were  often very militant, putting to  flight the myth of women's 'backwardness' .  Perhaps this was because  they had so little lose and so much  to gain:  Her mouth tightened again.    And d'ya  think it's easy for me?    If I'm working what do I get?    Twenty bucks a  week.    And rent to come out of that,  and clothes and carfare.    And seven  dollars for Tommy's keep.  (Left Hand,  Right Hand,  by D.Livesay)  Female workers were concentrated  within the following sectors according to the 1931 census: forestry:  19,147; manufacturing: 181,290:  retail trade: 96,979; finance: 24,  966; service (community, business and  government): 148,000; personal: 211,420  Women made up 31.5 per cent of all  clerical workers; 78 per cent of all  teachers; the majority of restaurant  employees; 8.5 per cent of manual  workers; 2.1 per cent of agricultural  workers; and 69.2 per cent of personal  service workers.  In B.C., women formed 9.75 per cent  of the B.C. labor force in 1931 and  10.04 per cent of it in 1932.  These figures denote two things: women were a significant part of the  provincial and national labor force.  Women were also concentrated in traditional female job ghettos.  Social attitudes towards these working women verged on hostility. Articles in magazines such as Macleans  or in newspapers like the Province  provide evidence of a running debate  on the right of women to jobs.  In  the Macleans of July 15, 1931, in an  article entitled 'This Freedom' by a  'Business Woman' it is stated that  "every girl employed means a husband  or a potential husband unemployed."  The article continues:  Today the country is in a bad state  due to women usurping the jobs for-  .  merly held by men,  with the result  that the native-born birthrate is  steadily falling.  The article ends by calling for a  quota on the number of women who  should be permitted to work.  Other articles in Macleans, such as  "A Reply to This Freedom" by A Spinster (Sept. 15, 1931) rebut her arguments.  This woman argues against the  exploitation of women by women.  She  suggests that women have a right to  jobs in industry, protection by minimum wage laws and improved conditions.  She discusses the financial  pressures on single and married women who support their families, and'  ends with a call for creches.  A later article called 'This Anti-Feminism'  calls for a defense of feminism as it  "defends women's rights and wins legal and financial gains for women."  Articles in the Province describe the  lack of concern and opportunities for  unemployed women, especially those  without families to fall back on.  This is at a time when great concern  was manifested for single men.  The Labor Gazette summarizes the dominant attitude towards women's work ► 14 KINESIS JUNE   '79  KINESIS JUNE   '79     15  WOMEN ORGANIZING IN THE 30's  Background  unionism, played a role in the development of women's consciousness.  Women were organized by unions because  they were in numerically important sectors;  they were organized as  potential revolutionaries with a role  to play within their own class.  Equally,  women could remain- unorganized if they were in an all female-  job ghetto,  or outside of a strategic sector,  unless they themselves  took the initiative and unionized.  In 1930,  only  15 per cent of the paid  labor force in Canada was organized.  This figure rose  to  16 per cent in  1935,  and 18 per cent by  1940.  In  1929 28,000 workers in B.C.   were  unionists,  divided between the Trades  and Labor Congress and the All Canadian Congress of Labor,  a small national body.     This membership figure  had declined to 21,207 workers by  1932.  Unemployment had a detrimental effect  on the unions in B.C.     The  Vancouver  and New Westminster District Trades  and Labor Congress  lost 40 per cent  of its members in the first two years  of the Depression.     The craft unions  turned their backs on the unemployed.  Between 1931 and 1935 however,   real  wages rose by 18 per cent,  due to the  combativity of trade unionists.  Workers' Unity League  The organizing attempts of the  1930's  were led, in part by the Workers Unity  League,  a member of the Red International of Labor Unions.     WUL was established by the Communist Party of Canada in 1929.    Its rank and file members were not necessarily members of  the Communist Party, although its  leadership was comprised of party  cadre.     Its focus was the organization  of unorganized workers,  although it  also functioned as a dual union,  breaking away militants from the reformist union leadership.     Its constitution included provisions for  members at large;  national rank and  file movements; and national and local industrial unions to affiliate.  It supported the principle of industrial organization, and was instrumental in introducing this concept to  British Columbia.  The Workers' Unity League established  unions in rail communications,  food  and agriculture, furniture manufacture and domestic service.    These  were primarily paper locals.    It had  its biggest organizational successes  in the forest industry,  amongst miners  and longshoremen.  These areas received  its attention because of their strategic weight in the economy.     These  unions led strikes for union hiring  procedures and recognition,  and the  decasualizing of labor.    It also established the Fish and Cannery Workers  Industrial Union in 1933,  encompassing  women workers.  Of 189 strikes across the country in  1934,   109 were led by the WUL.     In  B.C.   the WUL was most successful in  organizing and leading the unemployed.  By 1935 the Communist Party had adopted a Popular Front position.    Motivated by the emergence of the Committee  for Industrial Organization in the  U.S.,   the CPC led WUL unions back into the TLC (AFL).    This resulted in  a 30 per cent rise in the Vancouver  and District Labor Council membership by  1935.     The  labor movement in  the province began to organize around  (nip over to col.6)  (from col.3,p.13...)  in the Depression:  The popular belief as to  the sudden  invasion of the  labor market by women in recent years is not in accordance with the facts.  Dorothy Livesay in Right Hand, Left  Hand describes attitudes toward women within the working class movement.  She suggests that few working class  women had access to birth control,  or to an alternate perspective on  their lives as women: the emancipation that intellectual women of the  1930's strived for.  Rather, these  women remained trapped in the home.  When challenged, their political men  would state that they, married her to  raise my children.  Livesay admits, In  theory,   we were  free and equal as comrades on the  left,   in practice,  our right hand was  tied to the kitchen sink.  Despite these restrictions, wives of  union militants were drawn into major struggles; Livesay documents the  central role of women in winning the  Corbin B.C. miners' strike in 1935.  Attitudes towards working women were  better within the Communist wing of   W  I the labor movement, although there  was an idealization of women's role  within the family.  The Workers Unity League supported  equal pay for equal work; the seven  hour day, with six hours for dangerous  occupations; the five day week;  maternity leave, special compensation for women; 100 per cent unionization; the abolition of sweatshops,  decent wages and class unity.  These concentrate on the superexploi-  tation of women workers.  WUL saw the  inclusion of women within the wage  labor force as part of the expansion  of the productive forces which drew  in the entire family.  The WUL criticized reformist unions for excluding women or sidestepping women's  issues.  Women's Labor Leagues  The Women's Labor Leagues were affiliates of the WUL.  These were launched  I by the CPC in an attempt to unite working women, unorganized workers and  housewives.  The WUL program included  free birth control clinics, the organization of the unorganized; maternity insurance; relief grant increases; adequate food; housing; medical and dental care for children;  and end to military training.  Both  the WUL and the WLL saw the necessity  to organize women because they could  be in the frontlines of preventing  another war.  Women, drawn into wartime production would be able to sabotage imperialist intervention.  The  WUL indicted the labor movement for  its previous failures:  One of the reasons why the organized  labor movement has not made more progress in the past than it has done  is that it has not sought the cooperation of women.  The majority of evidence can be  found for women's organizations in  the Lower Mainland area, although  struggles are documented on the island and other areas for specific  industries.  Women also attended as representatives of various pro-labor support  groups, such as the Housewives'  A May Day parade in the '30s  League.  Women do appear as delegates  for some unions, through the decade.  The fishing industry had a significant history of militancy throughout  the 1930's.  In 1937 women working in the Namu  cannery struck to defend the struggles  of Native and Japanese fishermen.  White workers crossed the picket  lines.  Despite this, an increase of  $1 per ticket was established.  In  the same year women organized in Alaska canneries (Kitchikan) and won  equal pay with male workers.  The  Fisherman of Nov. 8, 1938 states:  Women were used in many industries  by employers as cheap labor to compete with men who had families to  support.  The organization of women would prevent this in the future.  In the same  year, cannery agreements covered additional women in B.C.  The Women's Auxiliaries of unions in  the industry were active.  Wives travelled with their husbands to the  fishing grounds, and often worked  in the canneries, cleaning fish.  The  women's auxiliaries were used as a  method of drawing women into support  of the union activities of theii"  fishermen husbands, as a "bulwark"  of union activity.  Only one example  of a woman fisher can be found in  the union's press in this period. ,  Fishing industry militancy  The Oct. 10, 1939 paper contains an  article on Betty Lowman, who fished  for halibut and belonged to the Deep  Sea Fishermen's Union:  Betty Ann who is 24,  robust and freckled and who likes to sing opera  when she fishes,  began her career of  working at unusually odd jobs about  four years ago.     It was then that  she paddled her 14-foot dug-out canoe  from Anacortes to Ketchikan.  Other women went out on the boats  with their husbands to assist with  the catch.  This drew them into union  struggles.  In February, 1939, this  quote appears in the Fisherman:  I am glad that we  live in these times  of struggle if only- because it gives  us the opportunity to prove to our  husbands and fathers how willing we  are to really stand with them in their  fight.  * In June of 1939 women supported a  struggle to raise fish prices (the  fishermen sold to the canneries).  Women asked for representation at mass  meetings to facilitate their participation.  Women workers organized in other sectors of the food industry as well.  Tn  1934, the only 'agricultural struggle in years' was begun by hop-pickers in Sardis and Chilliwack over living conditions and wages.  It involved fewer than one hundred workers.  Strike in the hop fields  The next year the hops field exploded.  Based on the last years victory which raised rates from 20c to  30c an hour (3c above the Minimum  Wage in the sector), 1,500 workers  went on strike in Chilliwack. Women  and men, many of them Native, were e  employed in the fields.  The strike  action resulted in arrests: four men  were arrested for "inciting to riot"  and having "intoxicants in a native  dwelling".  The workers raised the  demand that the minister of labor  intervene to improve conditions.  The  strike was lost.  This is an example  of a struggle involving both women  and men.  An article in the Pacific Advocate  of Sept. 2, 1938 describes the terrible conditions in agriculture:  whole families (again mostly Native)  worked for 13 hours per day and 55c  per day per adult in the Agassiz area.  The article called for organization.  Workers organized not only in the  fields but in the fruit processing  canneries.  The WUL initiated such or  ganization in 1930 through the Food-  workers Industrial Union, with minimal success.  By 1936, the wages of  women in canneries had been pushed  down from 30c per hour to 25c.  Perhaps the most militant organizing  in this period amongst women occurred in another food related area:  restaurants and hotels.  Waitresses  and busgirls in many small cafes  came into contact with pro-union workers such as longshoremen, woodworkers and miners; as well as unemployed  men involved in the area's struggles.  Waitressing was a common occupation  for young women and many women became  involved in organizing, despite the  high turnover of the labor force.  Wages were often below minimum, and  workers were denied rest periods and  decent meals.  As well, waitresses were concerned  with the quality of the food they  served: resolutions at Trades Labor  Council Congresses suggest that working conditions were below health  standards.  A strike of waitresses from Feb. 23  to March 16, 1931, involved workers  in two restaurants.  Their central  demand was opposition to proposed 20  per cent wage reductions (from $15  to $12 an hour).  In the next year  the largest sectors of union growth  in the country were barbers and restaurant and hotel workers.  By 1933  there were three chartered locals  of the Hotel, Restaurant Employees  and Beverage Dispensers in Canada,  including one in Vancouver.  One restaurant strike in Vancouver  lasted from August to October 1933,  involved seven workers whose demands  included a one year contract, eight  hour day and six day week, as well  as a wage increase.  They won.  In 1935 the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union #28 led  by CPC members, won a closed shop  and hiring through the union, two  elements of the WUL program.  They  established one of the best contracts  in the business, including three different categories of restaurants and"  hotels.  Male waiters however received  better pay than waitresses in the less  expensive restaurants, although for  women and men who worked the same job  the union won equal pay.  The next year, a strike from Aug. 29  to Sept. 5 of women workers won an increase in pay and a reduction of hours.  The Deutchland Cafe was struck on Feb.  18 1936.  On April 27, a mass support  meeting was built by the HREU.  By  July 7 both the Only and the Public  Cafes had signed agreements.  The  former signed after a strike prompted  by the firing of staff who demanded  back pay. Workers won the eight hour  day, an end to harassment for union  activity and back pay.  In September  the Trocodero was struck and picket  lines went up.  Descriptions of these  strikes suggest strong support from  the community, including help on the  picket lines themselves.  By Dec. 1,  agreements had been signed with the  King's Cafe and the Pall Mall.  White Lunch strike  These small strikes continued through  1937.  In May the White Lunch was  struck.  By mid-month it was listed  as "unfair." This tactic of an "unfair" declaration was used heavily  in this period to call for a boycott  of an,establishment by pro-labor  people.  White Lunch workers demanded ►  health insurance and the right to organize.  The  left in the  trade unions was represented by two political poles:  the  Communist Party of Canada and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation.  The CPC's initial influence in the  1930's was marginal: mostly concentrated in the Finnish,   Ukrainian and  Jewish immigrant communities.    Nevertheless,   it became instrumental in  unemployed struggles,  and was forced  underground in  1932,  when its  leadership was arrested.  It carried on its work through its  mass fronts.     Through its  leadership  in the unemployed struggles it grew  to 8,200 members in  1935  (60 per cent  of whom were unemployed) .• By  1939  there were  16,000 adherents     (Although  it lost 10 to 15 per cent of its members with the Hitler-Stalin pact).  The CCF was formed in 1932 at the  Calgary Conference,  bringing together  socialists,  co-operative members,  trade unionists,  farmers and progressives.  In B.C.,  it united the League for  Social Reconstruction,  the Cooperative  Council of B.C.,   the People's Party,  the Socialist Party of B. C.,   the Four  Point Plan,  and Army of the Common  Good.  By 1934 it had 106 clubs in B.C.  and  won 33 % per cent of the vote   (7 MLAs).  The international unions nationally  endorsed the CCF.    Its program differed from the CPC's in its adherence  to a peaceful transition to socialism  through economic cooperation and its  rejection of the Soviet Union.  Both of these organizations recognized  elements of the oppression of women.  The CPC's women's organizations were  directly involved in organizing women  workers,  the CCF initially concentrated  on party activity outside of the workplace.    The experience of working women can best be understood within the  broad framework of these organized  manifestations of working class consciousness.  The Trades and Labor Congress  (AFL)  included in its constitution support  for equal pay for equal work.    The  debate raging within the Congress  suggests that the fundamental right  of women to work was challenged.    At  the 1934 convention, Resolution 48  suggests that positions held by women in government departments should  be held by young men,  as men were  being denied office jobs by working  women.    This posed a danger to the  morale of the society.    The resolution  calls for a campaign to pressure the  government to replace these "girls"  with men.  The year 1934 saw a debate emerge on  the Minimum Wage Laws.    Mrs.  Jean  Laing, a delegate from Toronto stated:  We should establish these things ourselves, rather than rely on the government.  Minimum wage debates  In 1935 the debate on Minimum Wage  Laws continued.    Resolution 14 called  for a minimum of $14 per week (union  rates) and a 40 hour week,  coupled  with a mass trade union organizing  drive.    Some unionists opposed the  laws,  fearing that they would be  used as a ceiling for the wages of  the male skilled workers.    Delegate  Mary McNabb stated strongly that the  TLC must support minimum wages,  but  that trade union organization could  provide the only guarantee of decent ► 16    KINESIS JUNE  '79  Background  rates.  The 1936 convention pressed for domestics,  hall porters, agricultural  and home workers to have collective  bargaining rights.     Discussion at  the  1937. and 1938 conventions centered on the  loopholes in the minimum wage laws.     Workers were hired  at learners ' rates and then discharged  as soon as their apprenticeship was  over.  The 1938 convention reiterated earlier  trends on women 's minimum wage legislation:    A study of the cost of living was urged,  in order to negotiate  a realistic minimum.     The convention  supported Mother's Allowance in order  to   'keep the family together. '  In 1932,  out of 48,179 paid working  women in Canada,   3,939 were union  members.     Of these  733 were B.C.   residents.     In 1933 there were 5,047  women in Canadian unions;  801 of them  lived in B. C.  By 1938,   there were 21,488 organized  women workers in Canada.     Of these  women 1,371 were in B.C.     By 1939,  the province's figure had fallen to  1,121.  Women were members of these unions  in the Lower Mainland:  Clothing Workers of America #178; Domestic Workers Union #91 - TLC; International  Ladies Garment Workers Union §82 and  #190;  the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Association and Beverage  Dispensers #28; Retail Clerks International Protective Association #279;  Stenographers,  Typists,  Bookkeepers  Assistants #18172;  United Garment  Workers of America and may have been  members of other unions such as the  Meat Cutters and Packing House Employees Federal Union #95 or the  Native Brotherhood. ■  $14/week (from $9.50). Despite an  immediate victory, the union was lost  six months later due to turnover.  The lack of legislation permitting  union representation meant that employer intimidation was facilitated.  As well, the only recourse for protest was job action.  In several  restaurants, including the White Lunch  employers attempted to form company  unions, often associated with the  ACCL (All Canadian Congress of Labor).  In June of 1937 there was dual organization at Scott's Cafe by both the  HREU and the United Hotel and Restaurant Employees Association (ACCL).  This resulted in a long struggle at  Scott's one which the union eventually  won.  The Pacific Advocate refers to an  apparently unusual "roaring speech"  given by a Miss Emma Whitman, a Scott's  striker.  The Advocate laments the  lack of more strong union women, such  as Miss Whitman.  Strikes in New Westminster and Vancouver resulted in  union recognition and reinstatement  of union organizers.  Losing restaurants  Despite these victories, it was all  too easy to lose union recognition  due to turnover and harassment:, in  November 1937 the HREU had lost the  Stella Cafe, Waldorf, Peter Pan and  Eden restaurants.  The B.C. Worker  describes another struggle: one by  white waitresses to sustain their  jobs in Chinese owned cafes which  employed them at union rates.  This  contravened an ordinance which prohibited the employment of white women by Orientals.  Both women involved were married, with unemployed  husbands and children to support.  The Mother's Council and the waitresses  organized mass meetings and won pub  lic support for their cause.  Organization continued through 1938.  The HREU expanded its jurisdiction  to include chambermaids and workers  in apartment hotels.  The Vancouver  District Trade Labor Council set up  a campaign to reach these workers.  Another major sector which was almost exclusively female was domestic  service. Working class women had  little choice but to enter domestic  service, as few other job opportunities existed.  This trend was accentuated by the Relief system, which  directed women into such work rather  than providing direct relief.  An article in the Province as early  as 1931 suggests that domestic service created extreme hardships for  women with children to look after,  because it generally meant rooming away  Domestic workers: abysmal conditions  Conditions in 1935 were abysmal;  a result of the large surplus labor  force.  Women worked 60 to 80 hours  a week, board and wages amounted to  $30 per month, for experienced help  and $20 for inexperienced.  Some women in 1936 to 1937 earned as little  as $5 per month for a 10-hour day.  By 1935 the Domestic Service Union  was formed and in December of 1936,  a new union, the Domestic Workers  Union #91 applied for a charter.  The Communists played a large role  in this organizing, perhaps because  of their weight in the unemployed  movement and the close relationship  between domestic service and unemployment for women.  The leaders of  the Domestic Workers Union report  on threats made by the Ku Klux Klan,  early in the drive, perhaps related  to the CPC prominence.  Tim Buck,  secretary general of the CPC was  quoted by an organizer as saying: ►  1930's march of the unemployed •■>-, - •-.  Bedause domestic service is the basic  employment for girls,   the raising of  this standard of the occupation would  automatically raise  the standard of  all other working girls.  The union called for Minimum Wages, a  union hiring bureau to regulate standards in the sector, protective legislation and training programs.  It  also supported health insurance and  accident compensation, contemporary  demands of the labor movement.  The  drive was supported by sundry women's  organizations including the Mother's  Council and the Women's Labor League.  By 1937, the union had signed up 400  out of 1,500 workers in the Vancouver  area.  Many women apparently contacted  the local; many also expressed a hesitancy in joining.  In March of 1937  the union asked for lower dues for  domestics.  The same month saw the  union win jurisdiction over office  cleaners and domestics from the Building Trades Council.  On April 6, 1937 the union made a  statement condemning the Relief Office  for sending women out to work as domestics at "scandalously low wages and  long hours of employment."  This statement was taken up by Aider-  woman Helena Gutteridge and by Aid.  Pettplace who accompanied union representatives to the Relief Committee  of the city council to discuss the  domestics' demands.  The union launched a fund appeal to  the unions to build its campaign.  Some unions such as the Street Railway Workers donated money ($10 in  their case).  The campaign continued with a high  public profile.  At a public meeting  on Nov. 13, 1937 Mildred Duggan, an  officer of the union said: Employers  are  looking for bargains in maids  just  like shoppers.   She complained  that foreign women were being hired  to work at wages lower than those  acceptable to Canadian women.  In 1938 Dorothy Steeves continued to  press for direct relief for women  despite the proliferation of domestic jobs.  This would allow a slackening of the labor market and force up  domestics' wages.  The CCF developed  a bill on domestic workers' rights.  That year the union won a $10 per  month raise, a room charge of $2 to  $3; meals reduced to $4; a 48 hour  week; time and a half for overtime,  but could not win inclusion in the  Minimum Wage Laws.  Meanwhile women's  groups campaigned door to door for  support.  Garment workers  The organization of garment and text-  tile workers in B.C. was not dominated by the left of the trade union  movement, but was a result of international expansion.  By 1933 the Textile Workers of America had been established with Miss Catherine Wilson  as the city's only woman business  agent.  By April 1935 the United Garment Workers had established a local  at the Kokomo plant and had launched  a campaign for the use of union labels on garments.  The Tailors Union existed by 1935  and by 1937 the International Ladies  Garment Union had launched a campaign  for affiliation.  In July 1938 it  won a reduction to a 40 hour week for  its members from 44 hours, with no  loss in pay.  It focused on the union  label campaign as a tactic to insure  that retail outlets bought union-  made goods.  The ILGWU generally tried to avoid  conflict.  This was a factor in insuring that workers in the garment  industry never won hourly rates but  remained piece-workers.  Successes  in contract negotiations in the late  1930's were in part a result of the  increased demand for garments and  textiles for use as war material.  As the producers of consumer goods  began to organize they were joined  by those whose task it was to sell  such products.  In 1935 the B.C.  Workers New called for the chain  stores to organize.  In 1937 the  Retail Clerks Protective Association  had launched a campaign; by 1938 this  had reached workers at Piggly-wiggly  and Safeway.  Saleswomen organizing  Sales women in Five and Dime stores  on the island organized as well as  workers in chain drug stores.  They  demanded paid overtime, a 48 hour  week, $14.50 as starting rate.  An  article in the Fisherman lamented  the lack of such organizing in Vancouver.  It indicted Norman Woolworth  for getting rich off of "wealth created by young girls working for starvation wages and cheap crockery made  by kids." Meanwhile, a lockout in  Vancouver resulted in union recognition.  Organization reached a crisis point  when the federal government ruled  that grocery clerks could not be defined as a separate unit in a store.  Despite this, organizing occurred at  Woodworth's (meat cutters) and at  the Hudson's Bay Company.  Workers in laundries were also organizing.  On July 6, 1937 the Laundry  Workers Union, Local 233 applied for  certification.  The union went under  a year later.  One of the issues which  concerned the union was the mechanization of the laundries and speed-ups..  There are other instances of women's  struggles.  Hospital workers at Vancouver General Hospital fought for  pay increases and against lay-offs in.  1935.  The Restmore Factory girls  gave over one hour's worth of their  wages to the Relief Camp Workers Union.  A striking feature of these struggles  is the militancy of the workers.  This  description gives an example of such  militancy:  You should have seen a young girl  picket walking beside a scrap iron  scab in Nanaimo,   telling him quietly  so  that the cops couldn't stop her,  "You rotten scab,  you dirty   , you   " I've never seen the rest in  print so I couldn't spell it.  This militancy fits into the context  of massive urban struggles of the  1930rs, primarily those of the unemployed.  Women .rganized without leadership  from the established unions.  The  Trades Labor Council had put the  burden of organization onto affiliate  unions, but chartered locals often  did not exist in areas where women  were present.  As well, the need for  material resources was clear, and the  TLC expressed an unwillingness to  facilitate the affiliation of impoverished women through lowering the  dues.  Organized labor exhibited disinterest  or hostility to many of the issues  facing women, instead taking a defensive stand to protect previously established conditions and organization.  The early 1930's in B.C. saw a decline  in general union membership, a situation which could hardly aid in motivating expansion.  Some unionists  perceived women as an actual threat  to their jobs.  Women worked in the most depressed  sectors of the economy, ones which  traditionally were characterized by  low wages, poor conditions and lack  of organization.  Campaigns tended  to focus on primary industry, sectors  strategic to the province's economy.  In the East, the large weight of women in manufacturing resulted in a  competition between unions to organize them, in B.C. there were no such  pressures.  Rather, when women were organized  it was in support of men's struggles  or through the efforts of the Communists, and primarily, women themselves.  The central issues which faced women  were ones of basic survival: establishing Minimum Wages and conditions.  The overwhelming majority of strikes  involve these issues. Government a-  gencies were ineffective vehicles for  such demands.  Women's issues  were ones of basic survival  As well, women were affected by the  level of militancy and general left-  wing motion of the period.  They  played central roles in supporting  struggles in the unions and in organizing themselves, even in the face of  social pressures to remain in the  home.  There was little conscious  organization around women's demands  outside of the superexploitation of  female labor.  This can be traced  to the extreme oppression of women  workers, as well as the general lack  of recognition of the depths of women's oppression by the far left.  The lack of successful organization  in female job ghettos is far from  resolved.  The struggles of these  women in the 1930's hold a continued  importance for unionists of today.•  Scabs go to Victoria while LRB dozes  Muckamuck: strike one year old  June 1 was the first anniversary on  the Muckamuck line.  SORWUC, not unlike the organizers of  the '30s know that "every restaurant  a union restaurant" is going to be  an uphill battle.  Workers at Muckamuck, unionized with  SORWUC, have been on strike for one  year for a. first contract.  Throughout.all that time they have  maintained their picket line and their  solidarity.  Scabs inside the restaurant have put  in a decertification bid to the labor  relations board (LRB). They have gone  to Victoria to complain about the  strikers. They have harassed picketers repeatedly.  The LRB has been meditating on the  decertification bid since January.  Their delay has every appearance of  an harassment tactic aimed at the  strikers. • 18    KINESIS JUNE   '79  NON-TRADITIONAL WORK  Women at work: way up North  Linda Shaw  I was becoming very disillusioned  with my job as a secretary which I  had been doing for six years.  I saw  no room for advancement.  I was a slave to the men I was working for, the more I offered to do,  the more they liked me.  They even  expected me to vacuum the floors in  the computer room! My job title was  'systems secretary'*, assistant to  the big-wig of the company.  A woman friend of mine had heard of  a camp job in the North.  Rumor had  it that -men and women could go up  there and get a job just like that:  no special training needed.  There  were thousands of jobs going in the  construction trades and, to top it  off, they would be paying $7 to $8  an hour!  I would only have to stay  two months and I could pay off all  my debts and still come out with a  small fortune in the bank.  I gave notice at work and planned to  meet up with my woman friend.  I headed for Alberta.  Everyone I mentioned it to said I was crazy...  I dismissed the comments that the  camp would be full of alcoholics,  heavy gamblers and just plain wild  men. After all, I told myself, I  had driven a taxi and had been subjected to all sorts of subversive  men, so I was Sure I could handle  what was in store for me.  In Edmonton the almost endless task  of locating a union began.  We went  to see a whole list of union offices  in Edmonton only to be turned away.  We were told they weren't taking members.  We called all the construction  companies who had big jobs going in  Alberta, only to have them say they  weren't hiring any more workers.  Next we tried all the companies with  construction jobs in B.C., then in  Eastern Canada.  Same reply.  We were  beginning to despair.  Were these companies actually not  hiring or was it that they weren't  hiring women?  Up to Fort McMurray  Finally my friend and I decided to  drive up to Fort McMurray, 270 miles  north of Edmonton, to see for ourselves.  That's where the large plant  for Syncrude is being built.  Our  motel room cost between. $40 and $50  a night and the companies said they  were hiring directly through the  unions in Edmonton...  We finally contacted Canadian Bechtel,  the construction company building the  oil-processing plant for Syncrude in  the tar sands.  They said we could  apply to be secretaries up at Fort McMurray.  It wasn't what I had planned  on doing, but by this point anything  seemed good.  The pay wouldn't be much  above average, but room and board was  free and there was some subsistence  pay, also.  I got a temporary job as a waitress,  in a town south of Edmonton, and waited for that phone call for the Fort  McMurray job. My friend gave up and  went  back to Grand Cache where she  had been working in the coal mines.  Finally, the call came.  I was told  to take lots of warm clothing but  that jeans were all that was needed  to work in the office.  The company  paid my way up.  I didn't know what to expect.  I ar  rived late at night and was assigned  a room in one of the five trailers  they had set out for women.  There  were five rooms to a trailer with a  community washroom in each.  Segregated by barbed wire  The women's trailers were segregated  from the men's by an eight foot barbed wire fence. A sign outside the  fence stated that any man caught  stepping inside the boundary of the  women's trailers would be liable to  lose his job.  There was no provision  for married or common law couples.  The women had a recreation trailer  with several couches, a television,  a record player, pool table, shuffle  board and coffee machines.  Each  . trailer had what is called a 'bull-  cook. '  She lived in the trailer and  cleaned each room and made the beds  daily.  In the rec hall there are  two security guards to each shift:  they keep constant check on the  trailers, take phone messages and  were available in case of emergencies .  There are about 80 men's trailers in  the camp, a bar, a post-office and  kitchen. At'peak period about 7,000  men and 300 women work in the camp.  The North Camp kitchen, where I ate,  is made up of many trailers put together.  It has nine food lines and  feeds between 3,000 and 4,000 people  three times a day.  The tables we  ate at were huge picnic tables which  seat about 10 or 12 people.  I'd rather starve  I was petrified of that place.  I  waited for the one man I knew to  join me before I went into the kitchen.  If he was unable to meet me,  I wouldn't eat.  I told myself I'd  rather starve than put myself through  the ordeal.  There were thousands of  men sitting in there eating. Along  I'd come, walking down the aisle.  Every head would lift up, and every  pair of eyes would be on me. Sometimes I'd make it all the way to the  end without getting any comments.  If so, I was very lucky.  Other times  I'd get whistled at, sworn at or"have  sexist comments thrown at me.  The men had a love/hate relationship  with the women.  It excited them to  see women there so they could display  their macho charms.  But because there  are so many men and so few women, most  of the men felt ignored regardless of  their come-ons.  Many of the women were sick of the  constant harassment, which came disguised as "nice" gestures. We would  try to ignore it as much as possible.  This in turn angered the men, and they  called us snobs and bitches. They  felt we were spoiled rotten with all  this charm and attention, and now we  were too good to talk to them!  The parking lot where we left our  cars is a good mile from the women's  trailers. To get there, we walked  all the way through the cluster of  men's trailers.  This is a problem,  especially if we had been out late  visiting Fort McMurray, 20 miles  away.  Fear of would-be rapists  There was always that constant fear  that somewhere, behind one of those  parked cars, a would-be rapist  crouched.  (Also, in the winter,  when it was minus 50 we were lucky  if we weren't frozen stiff by the  time we got to the trailer).  Women demanded to have the parking  lot closer to the women's trailers  but their requests were ignored. A  man in charge told me, You came up  here because you wanted to work and  get paid like a man,   didn't you?  These are just things you'll have to  put up with.     If you don't like it,  quit!  Rape did happen on several occasions.  The women were paid off by Betchel  to keep their mouths shut. Nothing  ever got publicized except by word  of mouth.  Our work day was from 7 a.m. to 5:30  p.m. so we were usually ready for  bed right after supper.  I worked in  a makeshift office of plywood walls  and cement floors.  I worked as a  secretary for 20 engineers who were  designing part of the plant.  It was  an informal atmosphere with a lot of  foremen and general foremen of outside crews coming in constantly to  get supplies. Through the day I  talked to many different men.  Looking back now, I think that when  I first went up there I was very  naive about sexist attitudes.  It al-  most became easy to start lolling in 'ñ∫ KINESIS JUNE  '79    19  all the attention that was showered  on us. In fact, it became a standing joke when we went back to Edmonton for a weekend, Well, we must be  back in the city, nobody's looking  at us anymore.  Crude, sexist jokes with descriptive  diagrams circulated constantly around  camp.  He left the jokes on my desk  A man laid about 30 of these jokes  on my desk and gathered other men  around to get my expected embarrassed  reaction.  Another time someone made me a 12"  male statue out of nuts and bolts.  He was painted red and had a six inch  penis sticking straight out.  They  left it on my desk.  A male friend of mine got on as a pipe  insulator and that's when things became interesting. He found that he  was a misfit among the typical construction workers. He was unable to  go along with their, sexist attitudes  and sexual harassment of the women  and was shunned by them.  Through my  friendship with him I was able to get  a picture of both sides.  There is nowhere in the camp where  one can go to have a conversation  with a friend without being harassed.  Several times we went to dinner together only to have some strange guy  come over to strike up a conversation  because he had seen me before and  thought he was some close friend of  mine. We were not allowed to visit  in each other's rooms.  The bar was  impossible.  So many nights we would  walk all the way out to the car in  minus 40 weather just to have some  peace.  At -this time, my supervisor was transferred to another department, where  he became head of all insulation work.  On big jobs, like this one, the union  will give out work permits but women  need to have special connections with  someone who will put in a good word.  He calls down to the Edmonton office  and even if you are #250 on the list  he can put in a special order for you.  This is how all the women were getting  on as insulators.  The attractive  thing about the insulating, trade is  that it Is basically easy work and  starts at $7.95 an hour.  I approached my boss and he got me  a job starting in January.  The temperature was minus 50 so we dressed  very warmly.  That was the one consoling attribute of the job (apart  from the pay): with so many clothes  on and a scarf tied around my face,  the men can't tell if I'm a man or  woman.  How did you get on?  Men up there knew it was virtually  impossible for a woman to get on by  herself. So they tried to humiliate  the women by interrogating them about  how they manage.  The head of one of the insulation  companies up there was finally booted  out after court procedures.  It was  discovered that he had been offering  women jobs if they would go to bed  with him: the tragic thing is there  are women who were doing that.  There are different areas within the  .oil processing plant. Where I was  working there were about 4-00 men and  no more than five women.  I was assigned to assist different men who were  journeymen insulators. Whoever I  was put with would be jeered at and  given a hard time by the others.  To me, they would appear very friendly.  Behind my back they would point and  laugh and watch me work very closely  to see if I could really do it.  It was twice as tough work for the  women, not because it was difficult  in itself, but because all eyes were  on us. We had to prove a point: that  we could do the same jobs as men and  that we have a right to these jobs.  There are 20 to 30 men in each crew,  over which there is a foreman. Over  about six such crews there is a general  foreman. A lot of the foremen didn't  want women on their crews. The maintained that the women were a distraction to the male workers ard would  fire a woman at the smallest excuse.  The vicious circle  It became a vicious circle: the men  were constantly trying to strike up  a conversation with a woman on the  job, the woman in turn would have to  shun them as much as possible in case  the foreman caught her and fired her.  Then the men would turn on the woman  and call her a stuck-up bitch.  Then there's the other type of foreman:  the one who thinks it's just super  having a woman on the crew. He's out  talking to you constantly on the job.  The other guys see this and think  there must be something going on -  you must be sleeping with the foreman  to keep on his good side.  The fore-  nan in turn confirms the suspicions  by giving the woman soft jobs.  That's a difficult position.  If the  woman starts getting rude with the  foreman, he's bound to get angry and  she'll lose her job.  You want to be  treated equally and not be shown favoritism but you can't state that  gracefully.  I knew one general foreman who really  had something going.  He had everyone  convinced that when he got the boys  on the crew a raise, they should buy  him a bottle.  (It was usually a  raise that was coming to them anyway).  He applied this especially to women  in the belief that we could be manipulated more easily.  After only two and a half months I  was already making $10.05 an hour.  We were paid double time for the last;  two hours of the day and every 45  days we had our way paid to Edmonton  and back. So it was easy to make $360  a week clear.  In that position you  don't want to lose your job.  That  makes you vulnerable to manipulation.  The foremen's shacks were full of Penthouse centrefolds.  I don't think  you could find one square inch of  wall between them. Myself and another  woman, .Lyn, tried to explain to them  that they were living a double standard. On the one hand, they were  accusing us of being a distraction  to the men on the job.  On the other,  they wanted us to be a distraction.  We were nothing but a nude body to  them: they didn't let us be anything  else.  Lyn and I had the great pleasure of ripping all the pictures down  before we left.  Some men had pictures of women with  their legs spread all over hard hats.  The warm-up shacks had similar sketches  It made you very uneasy when you went  in to get warm. You were one woman  among 20 men. All eyes were on you.  I was constantly on the look out for  potential friends. Many times while  working with different men I would  say to myself, Maybe this one is really  a sincere person.     I'll give him a  chance.     But it was inevitable.  They  always came down to the basics. You  see, a lot of them became aware that  women hated to be treated as sex objects.  So they'd try the roundabout  route.  Discussing the harassment  My friend Lyn and I decided to hold  a little conference with some women  for the purpose of discerning what  types of sexual harassment they had  encountered, and to decide how we  could best go about getting our foot  further in the door with the next job.  Lyn and I were both shocked and depressed to find that out of the 20  women we talked with, not one felt  there were any problems.  They looked upon sexual harassment as  complimentary.  They thought all men  liked them.  It was a different story  when I checked with the one man I  trusted in the camp. He said he could  tell me numerous condescending stories  circulating about each of these women  by men whom they considered friends.  The women we talked with also had the  attitude that we should be grateful  to the men for permitting us to have  these jobs.  During the time I worked as an insulator, my former boss, who had got me  the job, and who was now head of the  department approached me several times  and asked me to go out with him.  He put me in a very touchy situation.  If I hadn't been able to handle it in  a tactful manner, I would have lost  my job.  I was finally laid off in May, the  job was coming to an end. My nerves  were shot, but I felt good that I  hadn't let them force me to quit, or  get myself fired because of their  attitudes.'ñ† 20    KINESIS JUNE  '79  INTERNATIONAL NEWS  Yvonne Wanrow wins  The trial of Yvonne Wanrow, which was  scheduled to begin on April 30, will  never take place.  She was to have stood trial for the  second time in six years on the same  charges of first degree assault and  felony murder for defending herself  and her children against a known  child rapist.  In what can only be seen as a victory, Wanrow's lawyers plea-bargained, with a five year suspended sentence, one year to be served in her  Colville Indian community, the result of the plea of guilty on the  lesser charges on second degree assault  and manslaughter.  This court decision is a landmark  upholding women's self-defense rights.  Wanrow's nightmare began on Aug. 12,  1972 when William Wesler, a drunken  child rapist, entered her babysitter's  apartment.  Yvonne shot him and injured his drinking companion.  In May '73 an all-  white jury in Spokane, Washington  found her guilty of murder and sentenced her .to 25 years in prison.  (Info Big Mama Rag) m  Lesbian, Gay  NEW YORK—Lesbians and gay men in  Nevada are getting ready to organize  if a Briggs Initiative-style bill  is introduced in the closing weeks  of the state legislature's current  session.  The bill, which assemblywoman Karen  Hayes has said she will introduce,  would require school districts to  fire or refuse to hire any teacher  advocating,  soliciting,  imposing,  encouraging or promoting public or  private homosexual behavior in such  a manner that creates a substantial  risk that such conduct will come to  the attention of school children or  school employees.  A similar ban, known as the Briggs  Initiative, was put before California  voters as a referendum question in  November 1978. It was defeated by  an overwhelming majority, but if it  had passed, it would have required  school boards to dismiss all school  workers suspected of advocating or  participating in homosexual activity.  Nevadan lesbian and gay activists  know they will have an uphill fight  to achieve similar results if Hayes'  bill is indeed introduced.  So they  are starting to organize early knowing that state politics are dominated  by the highly conservative Mormon  church, and one third of the legislators themselves are Mormons.  Last  year, the church organized a door-to-  door campaign against the ERA leading to its defeat by a 2 to 1 margin.  Hayes herself is regarded as being  part of the "new right" movement  against the ERA, gay rights and abortion. And in reference to the proposed bill she stated, Whatever they're  going to do in the closet,  I don't  care.     I just don't want them coming  out and molesting my children.  In Reno, the State Superintendent of  Public Instruction came out against  the bill, stating I don't believe  that just because a person is a homosexual,   they should be banned from  the classroom.  If we're going to ban one person  from the classroom,   then who 's next?   ■  Sexual Mutilation report  A revolution in cultural practices in  existence 2,000 years in much of Africa and the Middle East is likely to be  the ultimate result of the 300-page  Hosken Report on the Genital and  Sexual Mutilation of Females.

The  women, calling themselves the "Soho  Sixteen" have been charged with obstruction, threatening behavior,  assaulting police officers and bodily  harm.  The demonstration, the third of its  kind in London, was for the first  time marked by police violence and  harassment. Five women were treated  in hospital with face and head injuries .  The Soho Sixteen have all elected to  plead not guilty to the charges, a  time consuming and potentially costly  process if the women are found guilty.

Please  make cheques and money orders payable  to PS Defense Committee, Box 1, 190  Upper Street, London, Nl.a  The famous Marvin case  The publicity was pure Hollywood.  All the principal characters seemed  greedy and self-serving. And' the  $104,000 settlement was astronomical.  But Michelle Triola Marvin's $1 million  alimony suit against her exlover,  actor Lee Marvin, raised legal issued  which will be important to thousands  of women in.less glamorous circumstances .  The case turned around the issues of  whether a woman who separates from a  lover has the same rights to their  communal property as- a legal wife,  and whether a woman in such a pre- ,  dicament is entitled to compensation  because years of domesticity have kept  her off the job market.  Feminists in California supported  Triola Marvin because her case touched .  on issues vital to so many women.  After an 11-week trial, a California  Superior Court decided that the Marvin  couple's six years of cohabitation  did not constitute a legal contract.  Triola Marvin did not get half of  the actor's $3.5 million earned while  they were together as she had demanded.  This part of the ruling brought audible sighs of relief from large numbers of rich businessmen and show  business personalities currently being sued by discarded lovers. New  social mores accepting unmarried  couples living together have allowed  many well-off single men to evade  the legal responsibilities of marriage while enjoying all the benefits  of having a woman permanently around  the house. Suits similar to Triola  Marvin's are currently pending in at  least 16 states.  Judge Arthur K. Marshall did, however,  award Triola Marvin $1,000 a week for  two years for purposes of "rehabilitation." The judge noted that he was  awarding the money so that she may  have the economic means to re-educate  herself and to learn new employable  skills.  This aspect of the decision may well  set a trend, allowing thousands of  women who were not legally married  to collect an interim form of alimony  from their male companions. The award  tacitly recognizes women's lower  earning power.  It also takes into  account the fact that middle-aged women, in particular, are at a disadvantage in the job market because  they have not worked for years.  Michelle Triola, who legally changed  her name to Marvin in 1970, claimed  that she had given up a promising  singing and dancing career in Hollywood after she moved in with Marvin.  She did not promote her first record,  she says, because she was caught up  in redecorating the star's Malibu  Beach house, traveling with him, and  coping with his bouts of alcoholism.  After Marvin left her in 1970, Michelle  says she found that nobody wanted to  hire a 37-year-old singer who had not  performed in years.  After drifting through a series of  odd jobs, she landed a $125-a-week  clerical job, like thousands of other  newly separated women. ■  Guardian,   1979 KINESIS JUNE  '79    21  Automation steals jobs, endangers health  Pornography  Gabriella CaP°diferro, a feminist art  teacher from the city of Pescara on  Italy's Adriatic coast, was convicted  earlier this year of distributing obscene literature to her students.  During her trial, most of the 60 witnesses spoke for her, and on the day  of sentencing, riot police held at  bay the crowds of feminist supporters.  Her "crime" had been.to assign to  seven students a project on "the mass  media and sexuality." Part of their  brief was to discover the number of  students at their secondary school  who were secretly reading porn magazines and to use material from these  magazines as a way of demonstrating  "the continual commercialization of  sex in the capitalist mass media."  Her idea had been to bring out into  the open the student interest in  such publications and to demonstrate  the way in which they exploit women.  She had. obtained permission from  students and parents before assigning the project.  But when other teachers found pictures in a drawer and reported to  a head teacher, the project came  to an abrupt halt.  Gabriella was led from her classrooir  in handcuffs and spent six days in  a prison cell. She was immediately  suspended from her job until the  trial six months later.

Spare Rib excerpt.  _  Pregnant women take on GM  Nine women auto workers in Michigan  have joined the United Auto Workers  union (UAW) to sue General Motors  and Ford for discrimination against  pregnant women. The suit will potentially benefit the 42 per cent  of U.S. women who work and also have  children.  The suits filed April 24 charge that  both companies violated women's civil  rights by refusing to treat pregnancy  like other temporary disabilities.  GM and Ford both limited the period  for which pregnant workers could  collect disability payments to six  weeks, although other disabilities  were covered for as long as a year.  The companies also caught pregnant  workers in a double bind, either refusing to give them a lighter work  load or ruling them medically unfit  to work at all. The suit charges  that the companies were far more  accommodating to workers who needed  lighter work because of other kinds  of disabilities.  Both suits ask for damages as well  as an immediate end to the discriminatory practices.  The UAW is planning to file similar suits against  Chrysler.    Guardian April   '79     ■  A recent IBM study cited that virtually all tasks presently performed by  secretaries could be performed by today's computers, which are never absent, hanging around the water cooler  or attending union meetings.  While automation has yet to make an  appreciable impact on clerical employment in the U.S., word and data  processing equipment are already in  wide use. Some 215,000 small business computers are now installed  along with some 400,000 word proces-  ors.  According to a California-based consulting firm, the average secretary  is either away from her desk, waiting  for work or absent 46 per cent of the  time. About nine per cent of her  time is spent taking dictation,  typing or proofreading and the remainder of the time is spent answering the phone, handling mail or doing clerical work.  West German trade unions have predicted that about two million secretaries and typists will soon be out  of work.  In France, a report written by a  France ministry advisor warned that  the French banking insurance industries will lose about 30 per cent of  their jobs within the next 10 years,  as data processing equipment and automatic tellers take over routine computing and service.  The long-term career secretary is  probably going to virtually disappear,  predicts an- automation expert. ' The  few secretarial jobs that can't be  automated will either be taken over  •  by executives or handled by part-  time r~~  alternative (say the major corporations).  When automation hit the industrial  sector in the 50's and 60's, displaced workers were absorbed into  clerical and service jobs. Unlike  the last automation panic, this  present wave will leave no place  for the displaced office worker to  go.  The use of word processing equipment has brought about other hazards  besides the ultimate threat of unemployment .  The largest dispute occurred when 75  UN General Assembly pool typists  walked off the job for the third time  in two months.  For nearly a year they have refused  to use the machines on the grounds  of physical stress and potential  dangerous radiation. Although training on the machines is on a voluntary basis those who have refused  also say they fear eventual layoffs.  The UN insists that the equipment  is not dangerous.  One spokesman  called those typists who refused to  use them, just a bunch of hysterical  women afraid of new technology.  The greatest problem in analyzing  the danger of word processors is  that there is no generally accepted  standard for exposure to radiation  and little known about the cumulative  effects.  One labor organizer said, People  think offices are safe places,   but  they 're not.    It took years to alert  people to industrial disease like  brown lung and it could take years  more to spread the word of office  Historically, it has been the low-  skilled, labor intensive jobs occupied  by women that have been hit the  hardest by automation.

TWO  ISA  CROWD  a contemporary film drama  Joey Thompson  ACT 1  Young,  attractive,  ambitious newspaper  woman receives some bad news:  she's  pregnant.  Young,  attractive,  ambitious newspaper  woman studies herself in the bathroom  mirror,   searching for the  telltale  signs of how it could happen -to her.  Can anyone tell by the  look on her  face?    She sighs.     Not yet.  Upset,  anxious,   the contemporary  young woman seeks solace and advice  from her few women friends.     They  make her feel worse,   having y\o sym--  pathy and understanding for her  situation.    A dilemma it is.  She doesn't feel too comfortable with  the word abortion,  yet isn't in any  way prepared to carry and raise a  baby.    Besides,  she  loves her job,  and is trying hard to get ahead by  impressing her colleagues and ]  ACT II  Scenes of her childhood:  she in white  frilly dresses,  in fantasy  land on  sunny afternoons in flowering gardens  with her pleasant family.     It's all  so nice.     But she can't offer her  child this!  Her lover is mildly concerned but  somewhat flippant.     They are not in  love.     In fact,   the young progressive  newspaper woman,   sexually  liberated  (and the worse for it we are  led to  believe)  does not*feel very close  to  the man she slept with.  Lo and behold!    Our intrepid reporter  is sent to do a story on an unwed  mothers' home.     There  to greet her  at the door is a white-haired,  kindly  lady who is everyone1 s image of the  perfect mother.  Undaunted,  our Lois Lane talks  to a  few of the young,  pregnant women at  the home.    They are all attractive,  healthy,  articulate and pleasantly  content.     What makes  them behave that  way?  Well,   they are going to have a  (secretly   'unwanted') baby!    Our persistent interviewer asks,   "How come  you opted to have  the baby?    Didn't  you consider an abortion?"  "AN ABORTION!" cries the soon-to-be  mother, "That's like killing, ISN'T  IT?"  UMMMM,   thinks the young,  attractive  reporter to herself, maybe that's  what is wrong.  ACT IV  Anxious,  nervous,  overwrought and  suspicious,   the pregnant reporter talks  to her male doctor:  "Isn't it somewhat dangerous to have  an abortion?" she asks politely.     "Well,  says the male doctor wisely,   "sort of. "  He forgets  to mention that pregnancy  and delivery can result in death and  permanent physical and mental damage.  ACT V  By now our intrepid reporter is completely confused and disoriented.  She's just had a fight with her lover-  who-isn 't-her-lover-since-she-became  pregnant.     Of course,  being pregnant,  in her condition,  she is understandably irrational,  emotional and confused.     Her lover-who-isn't is also  confused;  he doesn't understand her  or where she 's coming from.     But  everyone knows he 's tried hard enough.  Exit  lover.  ACT VI  Visions haunt our fearless reporter  during her sleepless nights:    Green-  smocked doctors,  a whole crowd of  them,  bend over her helpless,  prone  body.     The doctors' gloved hands are  dripping with blood,   her blood,  and  suction cups are seen dumping gallons  of blood into glass bowls.  Disheartened,  alone and scared,  our  ambitious reporter turns to the one  person who can help her—the male  editor of the daily newspaper  (who  else?)  A white-haired,  caring older man who  has been married for many years.    'Only  he has the wisdom,   the patience and  understanding to deal with his employee  problems.    A few kind words about the  nature of life and love,  a few pearls  of wisdom about women and who they  are and why,  is enough to solace and  comfort our getting-ahead reporter.  Thank God for editors! she says inwardly .  ACT VIII  The big day has arrived.     Our young,  attractive,  ambitious reporter waits  in line for an abortion.     She glances  nervously about.  Suddenly,  a nurse rushes out of the  inner office and calls her name.     The  nurse glances about - the chair is  empty.  Our heroine has exited,  time !  Just in  EPILOG  Next on the screen are a short few  sentences which wrap up the present  and future life of our ambitious reporter:    she lives happily ever after,   having given birth to a healthy  baby.     Her kindly newspaper editor  allotted her 17 weeks maternity benefits and then she is back at work,  ambitious as ever.  This film, entitled Two Is A Crowd,  is distributed under the guise of an  unbiased "contemporary" film about  the pros and cons of abortion.  The pamphlet heralding the film reads,  "Two Is a Crowd is a contemporary  film drama about an unmarried newspaper woman, Jenny Baker, who finds  herself with an unwanted pregnancy.  Is abortion the answer? Jenny thinks  so...and yet it is not all that easy.  The film follows Jenny through her  lonely struggle with the pressures  for and against abortion.  "Although the moral, economic and  social conflicts involved in abortion  are central to the film it has additional discussion value in the area  of personal relationships.  The formative influence of family background,  the pressures of the peer group and  the role of the mentor or guide are  all factors that may be profitably  examined throughout the film."  Indeed, two members of Kinesis had  the rare opportunity of reviewing  this film, produced and distributed  by Peter Gerresten Productions Ltd.,  in Toronto.  We are mortified.  Sources say the film cost more than  $100,000 to produce. And it is suspected that the people who fronted  the money are the same people who are  behind the Anita Bryant Canadian visits; the same people who claim Vancouver is turning into a den of inequity, with "homosexuals teaching  our school children."  Not only does the film portray Jenny's  women friends as unsupportive, not  only does it portray abortion as bloody  painful and requiring 13 doctors and  four blood transTusions, not only does  it portray women (Jenny) as not being  able to make a concrete decision about  their own lives, not only does it depict men (editor) as understanding,  wise and having all the answers.  To ► KINESIS JUNE   '79    23  FILMS  add insult to injury the film carries  the message that if a woman delivers  and raises an unwanted baby there is  no isolation, poverty, loneliness  and desperation.  That Jenny was bought off is all too  clear in the summary lines which tell  the viewers that she was EVEN given  maternity leave, as if that clears up  all economic problems.  The producers didn't feel it necessary  to relate the high incidence of child  abuse in those families with unwanted  or unplanned children.  They also didn't  deem it necessary to follow Jenny  through her plight of securing a decent, roomy place to live for her and  a squalling baby.  They didn't show  her struggle with capitalist landlords.  They also forget to mention  her problems with finding adequate  daycare facilities and on and on and  on.  Two Is A Crowd is being distributed  to schools, libraries and other organizations. According to Pearl Roberts,  status of women coordinator for the  B.C. Teachers' Federation, the film  is not on the shelves of Vancouver  schools or libraries. Not yet.  Nor should it be.

Stevens  on workers and on the community as a  whole, see "Testimony", a documentary  film distributed by the garment  workers on the safety, health conditions and the economic impact of J.P.  Stevens plants.  SORWUC will be showing the film  following their general membership  meeting June 10 at the Britannia  Community Centre. All intereated  are welcome to view the film at  1:30 in the Elementary Music Room.  Jan Wood  Norma Rae has got to be the most■  disappointing film of the year.  Although basically a political film,  Norma Rae has none of the spunk of  Harlan County. There really is no  comparison. But then this film was  not written and produced by a woman  or women.  This is no doubt part of  the reason why the film is completely  lacking in feminist perspective.  If Sally Fields (Norma Rae) is deserving of any awards they have to be  for her ability to portray an absolutely simpy woman who falls in love  at the drop of a hat with a whole  series of men, last of whom, in the  film anyway, is the perfect stereotype  of the New York-Jewish organizer, who  reads Dylan Thomas, goes to the Met,  and comes from a lefty family.  The viewer is given no reason for  the need to unionize cotton mill  workers, other than Norma Rae's  apparent inability to fend of the  shattering charm of the union organizer.  Brown lung, the pulmonary disease  which causes hundreds of cotton mill  workers to die annually, is only  mentioned once, and fleetingly. The  unaware spectator is not offered an  explanation of the term at any point  during the film. Union organization  in the deep South (with the most  rabidly anti-labor legislation in  North America) is shown to be remarkably easy, its only real obstacle  being apathy and disinterest amongst  workers whom we are led to believe  The film shows the health and  safety conditions within textile  mills and the callous attitude of  J.P. Stevens.  Brown lung (byssinosis)  has disabled thousands of textile  workers.  One woman in a J.P. Stevens  plant had her arm ripped off while  operating a machine. The response by  J.P. Stevens was to fire the woman.  Consumers are being urged by the North  American labor movement to boycott  J.P. Stevens products. The products  include sheets, towels,blankets, carpets, linens that are sold under brand  names   Utica, Tastemaker, Fine Arts  are among the ones plus several  designer labels. ■  see no real need for a union.  When the certification vote is finally  held anti-union workers explode in  cheers of jubilation at the large  number of workers voting no, and the  union wins by a very narrow margin.  Meanwhile, Crystal Lee Jordan, the  woman on whom the film is based,  battles with a real cotton mill owner, J.P. Stevens.  The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile  Workers' Union was certified in J.P.  Stevens Mill at Roanoke Rapids, North  Carolina in 1974.  Since that time  employees have faced continuous harassment and vicious anti-union tactics (some of which are illegal even  in North Carolina) from their employer.  Quite a different version of these  events is portrayed in the book,  Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance,  by Henry Leiferman.  The movie is  loosely based on the book, but Crystal, her husband, and the real-life  union organizer, refused to sign releases for the film unless they were  guaranteed script control.- Producer  Martin Ritt refused and went ahead  with the film anyway, by using the  legally protective disclaimer that,  "the events, people and firms depicted in this film are ficticious."  The result of all this is a thoroughly  insipid film that is hardly worth  $3.75 from a working woman's pocket.  Let's hope the future will bring us  more films with the quality of Harlan  County and fewer with that of Norma  Rae.a  Not Feminist, but OK anyway  Jan Wood  For another non-feminist but more  realistic and credible film see The  China Syndrome starring Jane Fonda  and Mike Douglas.  In some of the publicity for this  film, Jane Fonda, as a would-be  hard news reporter is said to have  the principal role.  I was much- more impressed with the  scintillating personality of her  camera man who plays the part of an  overly-emotional male. Yep, you  guessed it!  The true charm of this  film lies not in the fact that Jane  Fonda plays the part of the kind of  feminist we would all like to be,  but in a certain fairly subtle role-  reversal which may still portend  better things to come.  The film starts out with Jane Fonda  playing the part of a reporter who  has been relegated to making up  anecdotes from cliche situations in  order to provide comic relief for the  real news.  She is dissatisfied with this and  wants to move up in her job.  It is  shown that she is willing to sacrifice a certain moral and journalistic  integrity in order to do so. When  an opportunity comes up to report  on the danger of nuclear power, she  sidesteps it, not wanting to jeopardize  her career. Not so with her camera  man who is willing to lay anything  on the line to stop this menace,  and says so in a very emotional outburst with his employer. A semi-  ruthless female teamed up with an  overly-emotional male.  It may seem  like an unlikely combination but  both characters evolve and grow  stronger in the context of a well-  woven and very realistic plot. A  film well worth seeing.■  I SAY, 6RAmeD,*ADioACT/\je  ^  WASTfe DISPOSAL. IS A PROBLEM-- '  AMD A SLIP-OP CO0LD MEAM AM  EMD TO LIFE 0) TWiS PlAMBT..

Do we need to  seek new strategies and different  structures? At a time when Ontario  women are building their own federation, the women in B.C. are taking  a second look at their own.  At the BCFW convention last November,  a decision was made to hold regional  conferences throughout this year to  assess the local relevance of current  BCFW function and strategy.  The Lower Mainland regional conference  was held recently at the Actors' Workshop in the downtown eastside of Vancouver.  Groups officially represented included:  Working Women Unite, Concerned Citizens for Choice on Abortion, UBC Women's Centre, Women in Focus, Richmond '  Women's Centre, Women's Bookstore,  Vancouver Status of Women, Rape Relief and also two not-yet members,  the Lesbian Information Line and the  newly-formed White Rock Women's Place.  A major goal of this weekend conference was to evaluate the herstory of  BCFW. A panel discussion developed  the theme of where we have been:  Cynthia Flood, Yvonne Johnson and Val  Embree spoke of the founding of BCFW  and the early years.  Yeasty, growing times  As Cynthia Flood said, those were  yeasty, growing times.  Conferences  and discussions among many feminists  and ad hoc groups in '73 and '74 developed the idea of having a federation.  Feminists calling themselves the Mothers of Confederation circulated letters about the idea throughout the  women's movement.  In September 1973 the NDP Women's  Committee sponsored a women's conference. This conference focused  on women's frustration with government policy and inaction on women's  issues.  In early 1974, a conference organized  by Linda Shuto on Women and Education  at SFU drew standing-room-only crowds.  Yet another women's conference, this  time concerned with women's studies,  held in March 1974 focused in part  on the need for a united front.  Shortly afterwards, women from many  groups in the lower mainland issued  a call for an Action for Women conference, held in late May and attended  by women from all over B.C. As Cynthia  Flood recalled, it was then that Gene  Errington moved that a committee be  struck to investigate the logistics  of setting up a federation of women  in B.C.  Numerous committees were struck and  met throughout the summer of 1974.  They formulated a sufficient basis  of unity to launch the founding convention of BCFW on Sept. 13, 14- and  15 of September, 1974 at UBC.  Some of the areas of contention during  the early days of BCFW, as enumerated  by the panelists at the workshop:  Structure (should it be hierarchical or horizontal?)  Rural women vs. urban women  Membership (should it be individual  or group?)  Communications  Much early discussion within BCFW debated the role   the federation was  designed to fulfill.  Should it be  very high profile, speaking with one  loud, clear voice audible right across  B.C.? Should the standing committee  take a vanguard position, making demands and issuing statements on behalf  of the federation?  Or should it just be an umbrella organization of women's groups from a-  cross the province, facilitating their  communication with each other?  What has evolved today is a decentralized BCFW where any member group can  initiate any action in the name of  BCFW so long as it is in accord with  BCFW policy.  The debate goes on:  Some members feel that BCFW should be  more alive and visible than it currently is. Some feel that BCFW is  only what member groups make it by  choosing issues and organizing around  them.  As it has been set up, the coordinator,  action facilitator, external communications coordinator or for that matter,  the standing committee as a whole, cannot initiate action in the name of  BCFW.  The role of the standing committee and its task positions is to  facilitate communications and action  among member groups at the request of  the groups themselves.  During the panel discussion on the  herstory of BCFW Flood, Johnson and  Embree each spoke about their personal  expectations in the initial organization of BCFW and the compromises which  have made BCFW what it is today.  Their presentations were of vital interest, especially to those of us who  are newer to BCFW.  Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning  sessions of the conference were opportunities for women to share skills and  experience by participating in workshops on Community Organizing, Problem  Solving, Constructive Criticism, Class,  and Alienated, Burned-Out Feminist  Blues.  The Sunday morning session, Solving  Women's Problems, gained momentum -as  it went on.  Latecomers joined the  group, which continued through lunch  and on into the afternoon.  The discussion about the direction  and nature of BCFW was resumed in  the afternoon session. Some questions  re-surfaced during that loosely structured session:  Not a household word  Why is BCFW not a household word as  yet? Should/can BCFW become involved  in areas of concern which are not the  central focus of any particular member groups?  For example, should BCFW have addressed the issue of the Ku Klux Klan leader coming to town?  Another subject of this discussion  was around anti-nuclear actions planned by the Pacific Life Community.  BCFW has no policy on this issue nor  any member group active in the anti-  nuclear area.  It cannot, therefore,  endorse the actions.  KKK  Most of the women agreed that it was  essential for BCFW to be taking action  'in the anti-nuclear- area and against,  for example, the KKK leader's visit.  But they also agreed that it was not  the responsibility of the standing  committee to initiate such action...  women concerned should form an ad hoc  group around such issues, and that  group could later join BCFW.-  A second major area addressed in the  final session of this regional conference was how to incorporate new  groups into BCFW. Should BCFW take  responsibility for actively working  in this area, seeking out new members?  What about new women who want to become involved in the movement? We no  longer use a network of consciousness  raising groups, which characterized  the growth of the movement in the seventies. Should regional reps, be actively involved in this area? Is it  the responsibility of BCFW? Member  groups? Individual women?  The structure, composition and function of the standing committee was also reviewed. Should we have a change  in the structure so that some positions  (for example, external communications  coordinator) be expanded into a committee? Should the standing committee  positions be reduced, with the committee doing the paper work only, and  should stronger links of communication  be developed between regional representatives and their regions, and with  other regions?  No concrete resolutions  Although the weekend was attended by  about 180 women in all, no concrete  resolutions or unanimous decisions  emerged. For' some, this was a point  of frustration. But it was agreed  that we're working hard in our different areas; and we're still, despite  differences, working together.  A final point of agreement from the  Sunday afternoon session was that BCFW  is still a success. Because of BCFW,  we have developed a greater sense of  unity across the. province.  It has  provided us with the opportunity to  meet and work together. Our constitution and policy has become a catalyst  for other women's provincial and national organizations. Six years later,  we're still growing. 'ñ† KINESIS JUNE   '79     25  CONFERENCES  Northwest Perspectives conference in Terrace  'We have to keep striving, being a noisy wheel.  Native women from several communities  in the Northwest led a discussion  of the role of women and the family,  both in their Indian environment  and in the larger society at the  Northwest Perspectives conference  in Terrace.  The three women came  from widely differing backgrounds,  but all displayed a similar determination and courage in describing  their experiences with racism.  A Catholic convent in Alberta was  home to Cleo Reece, who found herself uprooted from her Cree family  at an early age. Someone must have  told welfare:   'that kid should be  taken away. '    While she acknowledges  that the education she received was  useful, since she gained a good grasp  of the English language and finished  grade 12 at school, Cleo now recognizes that the Institutional surroundings of the orphanage and the  Church's influence led to a distorted view of things.  It was just survival  Once she left the shelter of the  convent, From there it was just survival,   says Reece.  She was afraid  of being 'noticed' by anyone and of  being known as an Indian.  Now married to a Tsimshean and living in  Prince Rupert, Cleo is active in  women's issues' and the United Native  Nations, and is very much against  native children being taken away  from their homes.  Lorena Gray grew up in the village  of Masset on the Queen Charlotte  Islands.  She feels she was one of  the more fortunate people in her  community because she succeeded in  gaining a good schooling.  This,  however, was more to her credit than  to that of the educational system.  Gray described the lackadaisical  attitude of the teachers in Masset  in the '40s: They just threw books  at us and sat back and knitted.  Since she had to earn the money to  put herself through high school,  Lorena moved to Alaska to work in  the canneries where the pay was the  best, afterwards coming to Prince  Rupert to take a commercial course  at St. Joseph's, an academy for  Catholic children only. She was  one of their top students.  Then came the bitter experience of  looking for a job where the only  work available to a native woman  was in the cannery.  In Vancouver  she found that guarantees of work  could evaporate once she showed up  and the employer found she was  native: They would get flustered,  make excuses,   she explained.  Finally  the department of Indian affairs  hired her as a consultant to outlying villages, but she found that  when she encouraged the local youngsters to continue their education  she was "booted out" by the local  clergy.  After marriage and children, (We  made do with what little we had),  Gray became a shop steward at the  newly-opened Prince Rupert Co-op  cannery and was later appointed to  organize in other areas. Political  action made sense to Gray: It in  volves our everyday  life,  and she  could see the clout (and therefore  the results) it engendered.  She is  proud that her children have followed their early teaching and that  her son went on to a university education and his own political activities.  Gray's advice to native women: We  have to keep on pushing, striving,  being a noisy wheel.  Love of an extended family and  respect for the elders was the  mainstay in the early years of  became a child placement worker with  the association of non-status Indians,  her task being to bring children being fostered elsewhere back to their  reserve home. Her sucess with children who had been "shunted around"  from home to home was, she feels,  due to the fact that she had herself experienced isolation from  mother and siblings, and, unlike the  social workers, "I know my people's  feeling."  I know my people's feelings  Now she works with the youngest children in her village whom she finds"  Doreen Robinson of Port Simpson.  Lacking an immediate family of her  own, Robinson was brought up by her  blind grandfather. She did not  attend school under the age of nine.  The one classroom taught about 120  students from grades one to five,  after which Doreen was forced by  lack of money to abandon her schooling.  Once grown and married to a Klemtu  man, Robinson moved to Vancouver  where he was taking a theology  course with the United Church at  UBC.  In 1949 she was challenged  to throw away her crochet and further her education. I really  struggled hard,   she said, recalling  how she would get up at five in the  morning to be in time for the practical nurse course, studying for an  hour on the bus each morning. She  graduated in 1959.  Her husband's job took him to Cape  Mudge on Vancouver Island, then to  Vancouver again for about 10 years.  Robinson's youngest was now 12 years  old and she decided once again to  further her education, this time by  passing grade 10 at Burnaby and completing a welfare aide course in 1972.  It was tough going, she readily admits, but she found mingling with  first-year university students helpful and was determined to open the  road for the younger generation  of  her people.  A job with DIA found her impatient  with the red tape involved, and she  anxious to know their own culture  through their language and dances.  Disintegration of native culture began with the reserve system, commented writer Lee Bobb of Vancouver who  has made a historical study of the  subject, and it is part of a process  spanning some 75 years.  It continued  with "our fathers and mothers, now  50 to 60 years old" who attended  residential schools.  The alien culture drilled into the students and  the schools' rigorous structure prevented the feeling of community that  had been strong when tribal society  was not disrupted, and now there is  a language barrier between the generations.  It is necessary to go back  to the culture of her grandparents,  says Bobb, "in order to march forward. "  Extended family supportive  The family unit lost its cultural  roots as the last leaders.strong in  the native family traditions (in the -  case of the Gitksan, the mother  figure) died, leaving the next generation of parents without a guide.  In the depression of the '30s the  family unit remained relatively  stable, since the native people were  not too reliant on a cash economy  and were still living off the land  to a great extent. The "final blow"  to native culture was the arrival in  the '50s of the corporate giants  whose demands fragmented the family  even further. 'ñ†  Courtesy of NORTHERN TIMES 26    KINESIS JUNE  '79  errata  In my article on the N.A.C. convention, the printed version stated  that the NAC executive meets "every  six months." They meet every six  weeks — an important difference.  In the Prostitution article, page  five, middle column, (under the  graphic of the masked women) some  words were omitted, and make it somewhat unclear what the last government's proposed changes in legislation concerning soliciting were.  Beginning with the sentence, In May,  1978..., the copy should read:  In May, 1978, only two months after  the Hutt decision, it included a-  mendments to the sections of the  Criminal Code dealing with soliciting in its Omnibus bill C-51.  The  changes were also included in Bill  C-21, introduced in the following  session of Parliament.  The proposed changes would have added a new  section 195:2 to "clarify" the  definition in 195:1.  On the last page of the Prostitution  article, the paragraph beginning  "This is particularly true" should  be placed immediately before the  last paragraph, i.e. after, "we  may be taken for prostitutes," and  before "unless women are economically  independent."  There are a couple of errors in the  Pornography article as well. The  most important.one is on the fifth  page of the article.  Coercive Sex  was NOT included; in the proposed  bill C-51.  So 8a should read;  A dominant characteristic of the  matter or thing is the undue exploitation of sex, violence, horror,  cruelty, or the undue degradation~  of the human person.  Less important, but for the record,  is that the heading on page four  of the Pornography article should  read Part Two: Censorship and Legislation by Barb Findlay and Jillian  Ridington.  (I wrote the introductory part; Barb and I collaborated  on the second section).  And, to be even more picky, a sentence got lost at the top of page  four. Between the second and third  paragraphs, there should have been  the following, It is not easy to  establish and maintain non-coercive  and egalitarian intimate relationships in a society based on the  domination of women by men.  With thanks and sisterhood,  Jillian Ridington ■  Lesbian sensibility  People like Connie Smith realize that  it does take a lifetime of struggle  to wriggle free of at least some of  the garbage but I also believe that  it is the artist's responsibility,  especially the lesbian feminist  artist, to help create through her  medium, images which inspire, set  new standards, and support the belief that equal relationships between women are possible and do exist.  I criticize any lesbian literature  or art which perpetuates stereotypes and self-hatred as I would  criticize literature which portrayed  blacks as white-faced tap dancers.  The creator of the "The Kiss" poster  has another titled "Amazon".  The women featured sport bodies sim- ,  ilar to those on the covers of detective comic books, (i.e. tiny  waists, very large upright breasts).  It's hardly something the urban  Amazon whose body has birthed six  children would relate to.  Also regarding Spring's article, I  resent, the constant insinuations to  my "insensitivity;" as we all know,  comparing someone to a man is the  ultimate insult. But most of all,  I resent the continual use of inferences to things I did not say,  nor did I intimate.  May I be so bold as to suggest that  perhaps Spring missed the point.  Connie Smith ■  Turkey of the month  This month's turkey award goes to  Robert Fulford,  for his comments  about the end of the women's movement:  it proved (our turkey writes) a proposition that I always believed in  but wanted to see acted out - that liberal democracy can change itself when  it's honestly challenged.  I believe  this is a genuinely open society - open  to change when change is presented as  a reasonable possibility,  open to  fresh ideas and impulses.  And so it  proved to be.  Women came to believe,  rightly,   that they were unfairly held  down; they protested,  in various polite  and not polite ways;  their protests  were heard; and the world changed.  That's the way it should work._  Saturday Night  Prison Justice Day planning is underway  For the past four years August 10  has become known as National Prison  Justice Day - a day when prisoners  and concerned citizens have joined  together in protest against the  practice of solitary confinement,  and to demonstrate in memory of  those prisoners who have died for  lack of proper medical and psychiatric care, for lack of fire and  safety measures in the prisons of  Canada.  Peaceful and non-violent protests,  in the form of vigils, memorial services, hunger fasts and work stoppages have exposed the incompetence  and indifference to the unnecessary  suffering and deaths of over 100  prisoners since 1970.  This year, the Prisoners' Rights  Group is inviting other groups to  join with them to co-sponsor this  event. As more prisoners and more  people from the community become  aware of the meaning of August 10,  they hope that such a broad committee  will succeed in focussing attention  on the government's responsibility  to implement the 1977 Parliamentary  Subcommittee Report on the penitentiary system in Canada.

Prior to the general membership meeting the executive had attended a meeting of the women's rights committee  to announce that this committee was  being disbanded. A three-person panel  would be appointed to speak on women's  issues.  The argument the executive used was  that they considered the committee to  be unconstitutional. But the argument  the executive presented to ,the general membership meeting was quite different. There they argued that the  committee never existed, as a women's  rights committee. The women's rights  committee argued that it existed, was  legitimate and had the right to continue as structured.  The women's rights committee has been  doing work, for example, in the area  of sexual harassment. Women had an  avenue to work towards changing conditions and at the same time participating in their union.  A feeling held by many women in unions  that unions aren't really interested  in women will be reinforced by this  latest action to stop women from  challenging sexist attitudes and  behavior.  The women's rights committee was  fighting for its existence.  The women had been meeting as a committee  since last July, reporting to the  general membership on their activities.
