This free service is  a response to a gap in addressing women's  needs in accessing and using the legal system. The clinic hopes to provide a safe, un-  intimidating environment for women with a  wide variety of legal needs.  The philosophy of the Legal Clinic for  Women is that since women experience sexual discrimination, harassment and violence  in society, our legal needs reflect this reality and effective legal responses must be so  tailored. The clinic is staffed by women  only, in order to provide a safe environment  where women's situation in society is understood and validated.  The clinic is located at Battered Women's  Support Services, and many legal problems the clinic deals with may revolve  around issues of violence. However, the  clinic recognizes that women experience  many other legal problems as well, and often have more "basic" legal difficulties than  do men (as is evident when women's legal problems are linked with the larger unequal position of women in society). The  clinic will deal with legal issues relating  to: custody and access variations, landlord-  tenant disputes, employer-employee difficulties, small claims, UIC, workers compensation or welfare problems, restraining orders,  sex discrimination complaints, uncontested  divorces, first offence criminal charges, some  motor vehicle offenses, and immigration difficulties. The chnic can provide legal advice  in many other areas of law and at a minimum, can at least give advice on a woman's  rights.  The clinic runs from 7 pm-9 pm on  alternate Tuesday evenings at Battered  Women's Support Services, #203-1847 W.  Broadway. It is best to make an appointment by calling the Law Students' Legal  Advice Office at 228-5791. Drop-ins are welcome, if space permits. The next clinics will  be on November 6 and November 20, and  every second Tuesday or Wednesday in the  new year at the same times and locations  (call for details).

In particular, Sharon Mclvor, an  Aboriginal lawyer from Merritt BC, is fighting the provisions in the Indian Act which  allow her to regain her status but deny her  children that right.  Ms. Mclvor's case is a challenge to the  "second generation cut-off" in the Indian  Act. The second generation cut-off in effect  incorporates sex discrimination which existed in prior Indian Acts into the current  scheme for registration. Under the current  scheme, the children of individuals whose  mothers lost their Indian status through  non-Indian paternity or marrying a nonstatus Indian, will not be granted Indian  status. Had those children had Indian lineage through a grandfather, rather that a  grandmother, they would not be cut off.  Statistics from Indian Affairs show that over  7,000 people have been newly registered  whose children will be affected by the cutoff.  LEAF has established a Public Education Committee to fight the second-  generation cut-off. This working group  needs a variety of people with a variety of  skills, as well as anyone willing to learn new  skills. Women are needed to write articles  for the planned newsletter on the case, and  also to address and stamp envelopes, write  funding applications and help develop new  strategies. LEAF stresses that they are not  looking for media stars or legal wizards—  just people who are willing to take on a job.  The working group meets the third  Wednesday of each month. Anyone interested in participating should call Ardyth  Cooper at 879-7367.

While media attention focuses on the Senate filibuster against the Goods and Services Tax (GST), pro-choice activists hope the abortion bill dies  there for lack of attention.  "It's difficult to get a reading  because of the mess the Senate  is in," said Kim Zander of the  BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics,  (BCCAC).  C-43 is considered by pro-choice  activists and health care workers to be one of the most callous  pieces of legislation ever drafted  and there is a feeling among pro-  choice activists that the movement may have conceded defeat  too soon.  "There is still plenty of opportunity to defeat the bill," said Joy  Thompson of BCCAC.  Mass action is what's needed,  activists say—lots of women in the  street. To that end, on October  13th, pro-choice activists rallied in  30 locations around Canada. The  rallies were organized by the Pro-  Choice Network, a national coalition of activist pro-choice groups.  In Vancouver, a well-attended  and spirited rally targeted Justice Minister Kim Campbell's office and eventually took over the  street.  "In Vancouver we felt an additional responsibility," Thompson  explained, "because Campbell's  office is here. Rather than launching a broad-based campaign, we  have chosen to target Campbell."  Thompson and others also occupied Campbell's office on October  Sunera Thobani addresses the Oct. 13 pro-choice rally in Vancouver  Charter challenge  Too much pressure, poverty  by Nancy Pollak  In a province where affordable  daycare and well-paying jobs for  women are distinctly lacking, forcing a single mom on welfare with  a baby to seek a job may seem  callous—even bizarre.  Welcome to British Columbia.  In November, poverty activists  will launch a court challenge to  the Social Credit pohcy that labels single mothers "employable"  when their baby (or babies) reach  six months.  Under the policy, mothers must  make a monthly declaration that  they are actively seeking work outside the home—or taking steps in  that direction—in order to receive  their welfare cheques.  While there are no firm figures  available about how many women  have been cut off social assistance  for non-compliance, the policy imposes a terrible strain on welfare  recipients. It also implicitly ignores the unpaid—and essential—  work the women perform as moth-  The Vancouver Community Legal  Assistance  Society,  working  with End Legislated Poverty, plans  to tackle the pohcy as a violation  of the Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.  Lawyer David Mossop will argue the pohcy violates the rights  of Canadian children in two ways:  age discrimination (babies under  six months have unhampered access to their mothers, whereas  older children do not); and freedom of association (children have  the right to stay with their families).  Underlying these legal arguments is the rather common sense  idea that women should have the  choice to stay home and parent  their young children.  "My choices are being taken  away from me," says Ellen Hiltz  of Campbell River. Hiltz has three  children aged seven, four and  six-and-a-half months. As soon  as her youngest crossed the six  month threshold, Hiltz enrolled in  the welfare-sponsored Job Action  Workshop, designed to get people  into the workforce.  While Hiltz has found the welfare workers in Campbell River  friendly, her three-week workshop  experience gave her a taste of just  how impossible working outside  the home would be.  "It was hke being on fast-  forward every single day," says  Hiltz. "My baby got sick after the  second day, and he was teething  and waking up ten times a night.  "I'm a person with a lot of energy, but [this pohcy] puts too  much pressure on people who  don't need more pressure. We need  more help."  Poverty activists got a boost  from the City of Vancouver on  October 23, when city council  agreed with Children's Advocate  Rita Chudnovsky's recommendation that the province be asked to  change the "employability" pohcy.  Chudnovsky's Child Care Report  pointed out that, among other  things, the lack of affordable, licensed daycare makes it inappropriate to drive women into the  workforce.  Kinesis will have coverage of  the city's new child care program in the next issue.  11. They were arrested, but not  charged.  "We felt that 'trespassing' in  Campbell's office was an appropriate symbol," said Zander, "because Bill C-43 trespasses on the  rights of women to control their  own bodies. As long as politicians  defy the rights of women, women  will defy their power."  Campbell has remained aloof  from women's movement representatives since a meeting last spring  when she reprimanded local activists for opposing C-43. Campbell has stated she will not declare  the bill until medical personnel understand it and has also stated  doctors need not fear prosecution  under the new law.  "It's very dishonest of her  to give such statements," said  Thompson. "It's not her role as  Justice Minister to interpret the  law—that's up to the court." One  current tactic is to pressure Campbell to simply not proclaim C-43.  "Proclaiming" a law is a formality  performed by the Justice Minister.  C-43 makes doctors who perform abortions, and possibly the  women who seek them, guilty of a  criminal offence and liable for up  to two years imprisonment, unless  they beheve the health or hfe of  the woman is hkely to be threatened without the abortion.  Sunera Thobani, a representative of the India Mahila Association and the BCCAC, says that C-  43, if implemented, will be particularly hard on immigrant women  and women of colour.  "Women will go underground  and end up with botched abortions," she stated. Thobani said  that in Winnipeg and other cities,  immigrant doctors and doctors oi  colour have been targeted by anti-  choice groups.  "These doctors do not have the  same options—the same kind of  mobility as white doctors. If they  are hounded out of their jobs,  there may not be many places to  go."  Thobani beheves defeating the  bill will only come about when  many more women are out in the  streets protesting. She says, however, that until pro-choice groups  focus on reproductive rights, immigrant women and women of  colour are not hkely to be attracted to the movement in great  numbers.  "For many of us, the issues are  forced sterUization and the right  to have and keep our children,"  Thobani said. "Also, new contraceptives are tested on minority  women first. We are the guinea  pigs. Access to abortion is important, but it's not necessarily key."  Canadian doctors are far from  happy with the proposed bill. To  guard against possible criminal  charges, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is recommending that women seeking  abortions be required to sign their  medical records as proof they "understand" the procedure.  Recent studies out of Alberta  indicate that 95 percent of doctors  in that province will not perform  abortions under the new law.  Thompson views the doctors'  withdrawal of services as a form of  protest.  "Women have always defied  abortion laws," she said, "but because of the impact of the women's  movement, they are not as willing  to he about it as in years past.  Doctors know this, and it's why  they are withdrawing."  One promising sign for abortion  rights is Dr. Henry Morgentaler's  recent acquittal on abortion-related charges in Halifax. A Nova Scotia judge ruled the province did  not have the authority to limit  abortions to hospitals since abortion is a federal matter. Pro-choice  activists had feared that other  provinces would try to restrict  free-standing clinics if the Nova  Scotia decision had gone the other  way. In Ontario, the newly-elected  NDP government has stated its  the opposition to the criminalization of abortion.  Plans are going forward for a  second abortion clinic in Vancouver. The medical building at  16th and Granville that will house  the new clinic has already been  subjected to picketing by anti-  choice protestors. Blockades, and  attempts at mass arrests have  cooled down for the time being in  BC.  "The anti-choice movement has  run out of martyrs," Thompson  said.  She expects the next tactic the  anti-choice will focus on is court  cases. Some anti-choice groups  have approached Crimestoppers (a  television program that highhghts  unsolved crimes). In the US, a  country where malpractice suits  against doctors are common, anti-  choice groups are suing as a way  to immobilize doctors who provide  abortion services. This tactic is expected to surface in Canada. Anti-  choice groups will likely recruit ex-  boyfriends and other associates of  women who have had abortions to  help build cases against them.  "Dragging women through the  courts is very much their intention," Thompson predicted.  If C-43 ever does become law, it  will be challenged in court immediately. The previous abortion law  was struck down when Supreme  Court judges ruled it conflicted  with the rights of women. C-43 is  equally oppressive.  "We do not understand why the  Tories believe C-43 will fly," said  Zander.  In case C-43 passes, the  Pro-Choice Network has issued an Emergency Plan. Rallies will be automatically held  across the country the Saturday immediately following such  an announcement. In Vancouver the action will be noon  at Kim Campbell's office, 1755  W. Broadway in Vancouver.  KINESIS  November 90 ACT UP  United in hope and anger  by Christine Cumming  ACT UP—the AIDS Coalition  to Unleash Power—became a dramatic part of the Vancouver pohtical scene this past summer.  Born out of the anger and  frustration of people hving with  AIDS (PWAs) and their supporters, Vancouver ACT UP is part of  an informal network of ACT UP  groups throughout North America.  Known for their high-profile actions and innovative tactics, ACT  UP groups aim to draw public attention to the negUgence of poUticians and drug companies—among  others—in the face of the ADDS  epidemic.  New York ACT UP has staged  die-ins on WaU Street to protest  drug company profits. In Vancouver, a Social Credit fundraiser  was disrupted by protestors who  thought the money raised would  be better spent on people who,  through government neglect, are  dying of AIDS.  According to their Uterature,  ACT UP Vancouver is "a group of  activists united in anger and hope,  working to end the AIDS crisis  through planned and focused nonviolent action."  The Social Credit government  has done all the right things to  make itself an ACT UP target.  Among their demands, ACT UP  Vancouver is calling on the Socreds to:  • develop a comprehensive  AIDS strategy. Ten years into  the crisis BC stiU lacks a coherent approach, some think largely  because of premier BUl Vander  Zalm's moralistic attitude towards  by Donna Henningson  San Francisco, summer of 1990  The newsroom:  Very much a male domain  "If you're incUned to piss in  the corner of your office, then you  know it's time to get out."  This comment by Helen Shnger,  CBC-TV drama development executive, brought laughter from 200  women from mainstream news-  rooms-CBC, BCTV, CKVU,  the Vancouver Sun and The  Province—as weU as the general  public. The occasion: a one-day forum on women in the media on  September 29, at SFU Harbour  Centre.  Shnger was one of 11 media  women who took part in the two  panel discussions sponsored by the  Canadian Association of Journalists. The organization, says local  CAJ director Frances Bula (education reporter for the Vancouver Sun), acts as a public voice  for journalism issues.  SUnger's remark touched on a  main theme: the newsroom is stiU  very much a male domain. Women  have another view of what is newsworthy, and that alternate view is  not easy to seU to male colleagues.  Dauphne Gray-Grant, chief features editor at the Vancouver  Sun, described the imbalance:  "Media are not very good at covering changes that happen slowly.  We faU to cover the things that  happen in sUence that change the  rest of our hves."  Keynote speaker Shirley Shar-  zer was a deputy managing editor of The Globe and Mail and  is presently the coordinator of  training and development for the  Southam Newspaper Group, the  highest circulation of any Canadian publishing group. She was  one of 18 members of a 1988  Southam task force report, "Opportunities for, and Barriers to  Women at Southam News." The  report examines the degree to  which women within Southam are  taking on positions of responsibility and power.  The figures are not encouraging. Of 126 senior managers, six  are women. In 1989, there were 31  senior management appointments.  None were women.  Bonnie Irving, editor of BC  Business Magazine, noted "Power shifts away from a position  once a woman acquires it." Said  GiUian Shaw, business editor for  the Vancouver Sun: "The granting of power to women is a sham."  Shaw called such efforts more  "public relations than pohcy" because, for women, positions of  power and responsibiUty force  them to make sacrifices men don't  have to face regarding their famiUes.  Helen SUnger told women in media to "choose a goal, go for the  goal, then get out of the position,  and regroup...centre on the product." Power wUl foUow, she said.  Patricia Graham, editorial pages editor for The Province, advised women to "never compromise yourself fundamentally." She  spoke about the tendency for both  men and women to bond together along gender hnes. "No  club, whether it be boys or girls,  is worth the compromise."  Former managing editor of the  Calgary Herald GiUian Steward urged women to explore alternate media besides traditional  print and broadcast, such as cable,  video and community newspapers  and publications. "Don't restrict  yourselves," she said. "Get into  the vehicle where you can move up  quickly. Share and give power."  AIDS (and sex). In 1989, Vander  Zalm disaUowed the use of a teen-  oriented safe sex video (produced  by the health ministry), calling it  "the longest condom ad" he'd ever  seen;  • provide full funding for all  ADDS drugs—at present, BC is the  only province which refuses to pay  the Ml costs of AZT, an extremely  expensive drug which appears to  slow the progress of HIV infection;  • include sexual orientation in  the province's Human Rights Act,  as a means of offsetting the homophobia which further endangers  many PWAs  • develop a Ml home care/hospice program, as weU as address  the critical housing needs of PWAs  • distribute free condoms and  bleach (for needles) to prisoners  • develop sex and ADDS education programs for schools which  are non-sexist, non-homophobic  and sensitive to cultural differences  ACT UP Vancouver's understanding of the AIDS crisis goes  beyond these specific demands to  include an analysis of how homophobia, racism and sexism have affected the government's (lack of)  response to AIDS. Above all, governments have scapegoated people  with AIDS.  In North America, gay men are  the most popular scapegoats and  aU the focus on their community  not only feeds homophobic tendencies, but leaves many heterosexuals and lesbians invisible, unconcerned and out of the research,  education and prevention process.  Women in ACT Up are particularly concerned about our invisi-  bUity.  When research, support services  and drugs that have been developed for white, homosexual men  are appUed to women, a whole new  set of questions are raised and too  many go unanswered.  What are the symptoms of  ADDS in women? What about  heterosexual transmission? What  about pregnancy, chUdbirth and  breast feeding for women with  ADDS or HIV infection, and what  about their reproductive choice?  Why are prostitutes being targeted and tested but not their  cUents? What about poverty and  malnutrition and their effects on  those infected? What about "safe  sex" for women and how should  women "negotiate" it with male  partners? What roles do homophobia, classism, racism and sexism  play in the epidemic? Why weren't  these questions asked eariier (or  louder) and where can we find answers?  The sexism of the media, government and the medical estab-  Ushment have aU played a part  in making women invisible in the  AIDS crisis. For example, we are  late in discovering that medicaUy,  women with AIDS die faster than  men with AIDS. And their symptoms are different.  Because "Ml blown ADDS" is  denned by symptoms first seen in  men, doctors are less alert to ADDS  in women, and many symptoms of  HTV infection particular to women  (Uke chronic vaginal infections) are  misdiagnosed or go undetected untU it is too late.  Government AIDS education  campaigns focus on abstinence or  condom use without considering  the cultural, sexual or economic  realities of women at risk. Women  do not have the social or economic  power of men, and for some women  "just saying no" to unsafe sex is  not a possibiUty. For some women,  fear of ADDS may be displaced by  the fear of violence or rape from  male partners who refuse to wear  condoms.

The boys apparently  thought handwritten threats of rape were just a prank that got  out of hand.  - 4 KINESIS  November 90 News  /////////////////////^^^^^  Commonwealth message:  Please adjust this picture  by Susan O'Donnell  October 9: Driving rain and bone-chilling  temperatures did not dampen the enthusiasm of the many women who encircled the  Centennial Flame on Pariiament Hill with  banners proclaiming the joy and struggles  of Canadian women. The colourful banners  emblazoned with images and slogans, representing the efforts of hundreds of women  across the country, communicated a clear  message to the Commonwealth Conference  of Women's Affairs Ministers: the Canadian women's movement is strong and wUl  continue to demand government action on  women's issues.  "It was a real national effort—every  province and territory was represented,"  said Banner Project coordinator Bonnie  Slade of the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC).  One hundred and fifty-four women's  groups responded to NAC's request to  send banners to Ottawa to tell the truth  about women's Uves to participants—  mainly poUticians and bureaucrats—at  the Commonwealth conference, hosted by,  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  FoUowing the October 9 event, NAC's  Judy Rebick said that often at international  meetings, the government presents a false  picture of women's Uves in Canada.  "We wanted to present a pictorial picture, to demonstrate the vitality of the  women's movement in Canada," Rebick  said, speaking against the backdrop of an  intricate banner pieced together by a Saskatoon women's group. "The banners are from  every part of Canada, from every faction in  the women's movement. They represent the  tremendous joy and creativity and power of  women working together.  "The women's movement is strong and  vital, and we wUl not accept any further  cuts to women's programs," Rebick continued. "We're not going away."  Noting that the majority of the banners  dealt with violence against women, Rebick  stated NAC's intention to have December  6- -the date in 1989 when a Montreal man  First in country  School's on, batter's up  by Diane Dupuis  Next March, Simon Fraser University wUl  field a woman's softbaU team, providing the  first and only opportunity in Canada for  women to play softbaU competitively and  obtain an education at the same time.  SoftbaU BC, the umbreUa organization that oversees amateur softbaU in the  province, approached SFU because a competitive structure was already in place. SFU  participates in the American National Association of IntercoUegiate Athletes (NAIA)  which has women's softbaU teams. Competition wiU be stiff. The SFU team—  the Clan—wiU play established teams both  within and outside its league structure.  Nineteen of the 20 women on the team  were actively recruited by coach Russ Boris  who scouted 30 teams around the country. All the women played three or four  sports in high school, but exceUed at soft-  ball. While most are from BC, the program  has attracted women from Regina, Burlington and New Zealand.  Dallas Jorgenson (first base/catcher) and  Janice HaUs (shortstop/third base) attended Douglas CoUege for two years and  then transferred to SFU to play softbaU.  Jorgenson began playing softbaU at age six,  and participated in the Newton Athletic Association for approximately six years. She  went on to the New Westminster Royals and  the White Rock Renegades Junior Women's  team.  Jorgenson was invited to try out for Team  BC. "Exposure from the Team BC try-out  and help from my coaches opened the door  to SFU," she says.  Carey Iszak (outfield/catcher) is from  Regina and played softbaU throughout high  school and in the Regina Senior Ladies'  League. For two years she attended university and played softbaU in Jamestown,  North Dakota.  "SFU offered the best opportunity to  combine academics and softbaU," says  Iszak.  The Clan wUl play a 45-game schedule  with approximately 15 home games. The  first home game is scheduled for March 9  at the SoftbaU BC complex in Surrey. Practice sessions, which begin in January, wUl  be spUt between SFU and the complex.  WhUe women's sports generally suffer  from severe financial neglect, this program  is comparatively wealthy. SoftbaU BC has  contributed $25,000 to the program to cover  some scholarships and operating expenses,  and SFU wUl pick up the additional expenses. Two scholarships have been donated  by local businesses.  SoftbaU BC has sent out information  packages to BC high schools to assist in developing women's programs at that level,  and has raised some money through a $5  registration fee coUected from its recreational teams.  WhUe opportunities to pursue softbaU  beyond the university level are Umited to  playing recreational softbaU and/or on the  Canadian national team, SFU's program  does give women the chance to pursue the  sport whUe obtaining an education.

"We want to change the sUent  epidemic of male violence against women,"  she explained. "The fundamental problem is  that the daUy relationship between women  and men doesn't work."  Helene D'AUaire of Reseau national  d'action education femmes noted that the  majority of UUterate Canadians are women,  the majority of older women Uve alone in  poverty, and any social change must involve a mobUization of aU the resources  avaUable to help these women. Referring  to Mulroney's announcement eariier in the  day (that the government was committed to  improving the status of women), D'AUaire  stated that she has not seen a real commitment to change. "We've had a war on  drugs. Why not a war on violence against  women?" she asked. "We need a change in  power relationships—that's what causes violence against women."  The federal government denied NAC participant status at the conference but the  44 conference delegates agreed that one  NAC and one Voice of Women delegate  could sit as observers, because Voice oi  Women is organizing a Commonwealth nongovernmental organizations (NGO) -conference for women in Canada next May.  In Ottawa, the delegates—about half o:  whom were women— discussed a number  of issues common to women in aU Commonwealth countries. NAC observer Alice  de Wolfe was particularly interested in the  discussions on structural adjustment because, she said, it aUows those working on  women's issues to use frameworks common  to Canada and Third World countries.  Structural adjustment—changes in a  country's economic structure such as removing tariff protections and redirecting social spending—was the subject of a recent  Commonwealth Secretariat report. In the  1980s, said the report, structural adjustments have consistently worsened the economic situation of women, and in many  cases, have reversed the gains of the 60s anc  70s.  At the end of the three-day conference,  delegates tabled a long report recommending that governments seriously look at how  their economic poUcies affect women, that  finance ministers set up committees to advise them on sexual equaUty, and that  women have better access to land, credit,  education and training.  Referring to a specific recommendation  that governments support gender-specific  research and expand services for female victims of violence, NAC is asking the Canadian government to: drop the recent amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act,  and the proposed GST and abortion bUls;  put in place goals and timetables for the  employment equity legislation (see page  8); and fund NGO groups which advocate  women's rights and provide support to female victims of violence.  De Wolfe says NAC wUl continue to lobby  the government in the international arena.  "Canada has a wonderful reputation in-  ternationaUy, especiaUy in the Commonwealth," said de Wolfe, "and we have to begin to say that [official reports] fly in the  face of what we know about the real situation of Canadian women. The government  gets to look wonderful on the backs of Canadian women." De Wolfe noted that the government responds better to NAC's interventions in the international forum than they  do in the domestic one.

NAC president Judy Rebick and vice-  president Anne McGrath wrote to Prime  Minister Brian Mulroney, requesting that  the nation publicly mourn the deaths of the  14 women kUled at l'Ecole polytechnique  last year by observing 14 minutes of sUence  in the House of Commons, placing the flag  at half-mast and conducting a ceremony at  Parhament HUl.  "We beUeve that it is very important that  the memory of the Montreal massacre not  be aUowed to fade from public consciousness. SUence is a powerful cloak that hides  the reaUty of the male violence that women  Uve with every day," NAC said.  The organization has specified that the  Day of Commemoration would mourn aU  victims of male violence against women.  The women recaUed the messages of support that poured in from aU over the  world. The Network of Women Students in  AustraUa wrote that, "Such an attack on  the women students at the University in  Montreal is but a symptom of society's relegation of women to second class status and  the victimization and hatred that is engendered by this role."  NAC has also urged the United Nations  to commemorate December 6 as a day to  caU attention to the worldwide problem of  male violence against women.  The women who died were Genevieve  Bergeron, Helene Colgan, Nathalie Croteau,  Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward,  Maud Havernick, Barbara Marie Kleuznick,  Maryse Laganiere, Maryse Leclair, Anne-  Marie Lemay, Sonia PeUetier, Michele  Richard and Annie Turcotte.  Stop the dangers,  not the women  In a class-action lawsuit currently before  the US Supreme Court, women are suing  for the right to hold jobs which carry serious risk of fetal damage. Nine battery plants  are charged with sexual discrimination over  their poUcy designed to Umit the exposure  of women of chUdbearing age to lead, a primary ingredient in battery fabrication.  Among other things, the women are arguing that rather than eUminating them  from the dangerous jobs, the job's dangers should be eUminated through measures  agreed upon by workers, the companies and  the government.  One of the plants—a leading US manufacturer—gave employee Virginia Green,  50, five minutes notice in 1982 before transferring her from a job she had held for 11  years. Citing their Hetdl protection poUcy,"  the Johnson Controls Company bumped  Green to a laundry job, washing the respirators of her former male co-workers.  Both sides in the case agree that lead  exposure can cause severe developmental  problems in fetuses. But critics contend  company poUcy amounts to sex discrimination because aU women up the age of 50  are subject to the poUcy regardless of their  chUdbearing plans or fertUity.  Lawyer Marsha Berzon, for the women  plaintiffs, said the company invokes the policy regardless of whether workers intend to  have chUdren, plan to wait untU long after  leaving the plant, or keep their lead exposure to levels deemed safe by government.  One woman chose sterUization rather than  surrender her high risk position.  The rule violates federal laws forbidding  job discrimination based on sex or pregnancy, said Berzon. "This poUcy, if upheld,  would...sanction the re-segregation of the  work force."  There are fears that a victory for the  plants could spawn dozens of others prohibiting women from getting and keeping  the higher paying factory jobs. At least 15  major US plants have fetal protection poU-  Holistic  programs for  and by hookers  A proposal aimed at helping prostitutes  who want to get out of the business was  tabled in the House of Commons in early  October.

"Holistic programs...are called for," the  report stated. "They must be accessible  and must also facUitate positive changes for  those who choose alternatives to the street."  Such programs would incorporate "treatment, legal services, education, job training  and Ufe skUls."  The report pointed to Winnipeg's Prostitutes and Other Women For Equal Rights  (POWER) as an effective example.

The ruUng dismissed charges of misbehaviour and said his comments reported  in the press would not affect his abihty to  continue as a judge.  Bourassa made himself the target of Native and women's advocacy groups as far  back as 1984 when he said a 13-year-old,  mentally handicapped rape victim "consented" to intercourse with three men.  In another judgement, a former pohtician  was let off with only five days in jaU and nine  months probation for repeatedly fondUng a  young girl.  In December 1989, The Edmonton Journal quoted Bourassa as saying sexual assault among northern Natives was "less violent," and can't be judged the same way  as in southern Canada.

Now, the province's pay equity commissioner Brigid O'ReUly is saying premier Bob  Rae's promise to extend coverage at a cost  of $60 miUion is unreaUstic.  Estimates of three times that amount are  being proposed as a more accurate reflection  of true costs to the new NDP government.  Pay equity activists beUeve, however,  that the NDP must tackle the compUcated  and expensive nature of the problem. "We  expect that they would Uve up to their  promise to extend coverage," says Mary  Cornish of the Equal Pay Coalition, the major pay equity lobby.  Ontario's legislation covers both pubUc and private sectors employees, and is  designed to increase salaries in female-  dominated jobs by bringing their pay in Une  with comparable male jobs.  The Ontario Federation of Labour estimates that almost a miUion women are denied pay equity under existing legislation  because their work does not have a read-  Uy avaUable male equivalent to compare. As  weU, workplaces with fewer than 10 employees are also exempt.  Pay equity lobbyists assume Rae's election assurance wUl now mean that these  women wUl be eUgible for salary hikes.  Activists also say that, along with pay  increases for public-sector workers in fields  such as nursing and day care, the government must fund a legal chnic for non-  unionized women in order to make the pay  equity legislation effective.

Electronic  fetal heartrate monitoring: a reUable and  valuable birthing tool or an unreliable, unnecessary piece of technology? Does it contribute to compUcations at birth, or does  it provide reassurance that aU is weU and  speed intervention if aU is not weU?  Disagreement about electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has existed between the medical community and proponents of natural  chUdbirth since the procedure was introduced about twenty-five years ago. And the  many scientific studies of EFM have fueUed  the debate on both sides (see box).  A recent study, in part carried out at  Vancouver's Grace Hospital, found cerebral palsy in 20 percent of premature infants monitored electronically, compared to  8 percent of those checked with a stethoscope. The study foUowed up 173 infants, 18  months after birth, who had been born between 26 and 32 weeks gestation and who  had been randoMy assigned to the two  types of monitoring group.  These surprising, even alarming, results  have been received cooUy by physicians—as  have most other studies of EFM.  Dr. Sydney Effer, an obstetrician at  Grace Hospital who took part in the recent  study, said that "physicians are skeptical to  beUeve those results are vaUd."  He pointed to a less-than-ideal statistical analysis of the data, his main objection  being that the random selection of subjects  placed six babies of extremely low birth  weight in the group which received electronic monitoring. Effer felt that this fact  alone could have been responsible for the  higher rate of cerebral palsy in the EFM  group, as the risk of this disorder occurring  increases with lower birth weights.  Cerebral palsy is a permanent movement  disorder resulting from damage to the developing nervous system. There are a number  of different causes, though Effer acknowledged that oxygen deprivation during birth  is always considered to contribute to the  condition.  When fetal distress becomes evident, it is  necessary to hasten deUvery of the baby to  avoid oxygen deprivation. The study found  there was a longer time from detecting signs  of distress to deUvery in the group monitored electronically. It is not clear why this  occurred.  Effer summed up the medical response  to this study: "It hasn't changed anything,  there's nothing different."  So we are no nearer a clear statement of  the worth or demerits of EFM, at least not  from the mainstream medical community.  However, there are many other voices raised  in objection.  Linda Knox, a practicing midwife in Vancouver, beUeves "a huge amount of what  is accepted as normal practice has never  been evaluated." For example, EFM can  be used throughout an entire labour which  means the woman and her fetus can be  bombarded with ultrasound waves for many  hours. Long term effects of such uses of ultrasound are as yet unknown.  It is easy to be skeptical of scientific studies since they are open to a range of inter-  that the monitor may pick up false information or that there may be difficulties interpreting the print-out. Some women see  EFM as the first step in aUowing further intervention in their birthing process. There  are more generalized fears that it may be  harmful to the baby and that it may decrease a woman's chance of labouring spontaneously.  AU of these concerns have an effect on a  woman's physical and emotional condition  during labour.  Linda Knox does not use electronic monitoring in her midwifery practice though she  birth methods? Technology helps versus  technology harms. Perhaps. Perhaps not.  Are there other, bigger issues hiding just  below the surface?  The value of individual, constant human  monitoring was also upheld by Effer, but he  said that in usual clinical practice it is difficult to ensure this level of care.  "One patient/one nurse is Grace Hospital's pohcy but there are inevitably times  when this is not the case," said Effer.  "Emergencies occur and a nurse is removed  pretation. StiU, EFM is in wide and routine  use, yet its value is far from established and  its shortcomings are, for the most part, ignored.  Lorena Battistel, a chUdbirth educator and member of the Lower MaMand  ChUdbearing Association, teaches pre-natal  classes and attends women in labour. She  has seen the routine use of EFM increasing,  and has a Ust of objections both she and  pregnant women have to the procedure.  The foremost of these is that being attached to a machine restricts a woman's  movement, which often prolongs labour. Internal fetal monitoring (which involves an  electrode attached to the fetus's head) can  introduce infection. Women are concerned  How it works  An electronic fetal monitor is a machine  which uses ultrasound and a pressure gauge  to record a fetus' heart rate and contractions of the uterus during labour. The devices which do the measuring are held in  place by two straps taped around a woman's  abdomen. The measurements are recorded  on a print-out in the form of a graph.  H the fetal heart rate decreases, the fetus  may be in trouble. The purpose of continuous EFM is to ensure fetal distress is detected as soon as possible so that the baby  can be deUvered in good health.  is quick to acknowledge its value in the care  of women with high risk pregnancies. However, she beUeves it should not be used in  normal deUveries. Knox recognises that the  use of EFM has reduced the rate of infant mortaUty, but it has also increased the  rate of both maternal and infant compUcations during and after birth. She said it  is weU-known that there has been an increase in caesarean section and forceps deUveries since EFM was introduced—rates  which could be as much as one third higher.  "My fear is that we are going to have  technical birth [even] more than we do,"  said Knox.  Knox thinks EFM is reUed upon far too  much and that, consequently, modern practitioners are losing their skiUs. She described what she sees as a fragmentation of  care. Numerous people attend a woman in  labour and the fetal monitor is reUed on as  the constant presence.  "Women are often ignored and the focus  is on the machine. It's really a shame," says  Knox.  Though EFM is seen as giving continuous monitoring—whereas a stethoscope  is only used intermittently—Knox said a  skiUed midwife who gives continuity of care  throughout labour is more Ukely to use her  various skiUs to monitor the program of  labour, and gaps in observation wUl not occur.  Is it straightforward debate, then, revolving around different phUosophies of chUd-  fiom a patient. If we had enough trained  nurses to do this [constant monitoring with  a stethoscope] there's no doubt it would be  preferable. But can we afford this?"  Midwife Knox also provided an additional perspective Gn the issue: "EFM is  used because we have such a Utigation approach towards birth," said Knox, referring  rWOWWWWWW  "Women are often  ignored and the focus  is on the machine..."  W««W«««M»0»M  to the fact that EFM provides a hard, indisputable print record of the labour, which  may be presented in court should legal action be brought against a medical practitioner.  H issues such as nursing shortages and Utigation are at the centre of the controversy  surrounding the use of EFM, then they need  to be addressed openly and added to the Ust  of medical concerns.  After aU, the profound issue of the physical and emotional weU-being of women and  the birth of healthy babies are at stake here.  KINESIS  November 90 NEWS  Employment equity  To strengthen a feeble act  by Hannah Hadikan  The federal government's passage of the  Employment Equity Act (EEA) in 1986  should have signified a major step towards  providing for equal employment opportunities for members of the four groups designated under the act—women, Aboriginal  peoples, persons with disabiUties and people of colour (see box).  At a recent National Employment Equity  Network (NEEN) conference, it was made  abundantly clear the EEA has faUed to de-  Uver any significant changes in any of these  areas, for any of these groups.  NEEN brings together non-governmental  groups representing the four target populations. Their conference, "Redressing the  Balance: Achieving Equality in Employment in the 1990s" was held in Ottawa in  late September.  [employment equity]  can only be achieved  through...mandatory  targets and timetables  (NEEN, which the government regularly  consults with on employment equity matters, was informed the night before the  conference began that a grant, verbaUy  promised by the Secretary of State, was  turned down.)  Employers' reports, submitted annuaUy  under the EEA, show that women continue to be compressed in low-paying positions with poor representation in management, professions, skUled trades and  technology areas. While a few opportunities may have opened up for weU-educated  middle-class women, the economic situation has not improved for the majority.  Women of colour, Native women and disabled women face double-bind discrimination, remaining among the lowest paid.  The delegates to the NEEN Conference  were of the unanimous opinion that successful implementation of the EEA can only be  achieved through a process of mandatory  targets and timetables, an enforcement system with sanctions for non-compUance, and  an effective monitoring program—features  which are conspicuously absent from the existing act.  The conference looked at studies of  American affirmative action programs—  considered much tougher than the EEA—  which showed that the threat of fines for  faUing to reach hiring quotas within set  timetables resulted in employment gains for  people of colour. When it is mandatory for  employers to meet clear numerical objectives (i.e. affirmative action), they are more  Ukely to invest the necessary resources to  affect the fundamental changes required to  achieve employment equity.  There was general agreement at the conference that employment equity should not,  however, be narrowly defined as simply conforming to government regulations. With  racism and sexism deeply rooted in the  workplace, making systemic discrimination  visible and then changing attitudes are critical steps. Barriers are different for members of the designated groups, and deUber-  ate measures must be taken to overcome the  effect of decades of discriminatory employment practices.  The conference also passed a resolution  calling upon the EEA to require that employers Ust their employment practices including: recruitment; determination of job  qualifications; hiring and selection criteria;  training programs; transfer and promotion;  hours of work and schedules; compensation;  workplace design and physical access; organization of work; technology and processes;  impact of seniority provisions; provision of  chUdcare services; provision of ESL/FSL  courses; and provision for leaves of absence.  It is evident that employers have a long  way to go towards providing adequate access and accommodation for women with  different needs, including flextime, work-  sharing, chUdcare facUities and educational  assistance. Job training and re-training are  essential to women re-entering the labour  market after years of homemaking and  chUd-rearing. In addition to learning new  skiUs required to keep pace with technological growth, women often deal with the  "culture shock" of entering mde-dominated  Don't  be shy  At Kinesis, we know that  writing is a brave act,  especially if you've never been  published before.

Employment equity cannot simply  mean treating all employees equaUy—i.e.  the white male, able-bodied standard—but  rather adapting to our various needs and  cultures.  timetables can ensure the proper implementation of employment equity. To this end,  NEEN is calling for the establishment of  an independent Employment Equity Commission with adequate resources to enforce  an amended act. (At present, the Canadian  Human Rights Commission administers the  It is the absence of these necessary initiatives that prevents many women from gainful employment.  Mary CoUins, Minister Responsible for  the Status of Women, went on record in  early October as being against setting quotas and timetables in order to achieve employment equity. The EEA is up for review  in 1991. In 1988, EEA reporting revealed  that aU designated groups had made minuscule gains in rates of employment and pay  since the bUl was introduced.  Contrary to CoUins' views, NEEN conference participants strongly supported a  resolution that only mandatory targets and  EEA.) In addition to its enforcement function, the Commission must have an educational and consultative arm.

The  legislation requires aU federally-regulated  employers with 100 or more employees to  implement employment equity plans and  programs and to report annually on their  results.  The purpose of the legislation is to  achieve a representative work force, so that  no person is denied employment opportunities or benefits for reason unrelated to abU-  ity, and to correct disadvantages in employment opportunities experienced by women,  Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabiUties  and people of colour.  The legislation affects almost 400 employers, primarily in banking, transportation and communication.

It is not, however, my intention  to invalidate the personal integrity and  uniqueness of an individual woman's  beliefs or to suggest that I am in anyway an authority on the subject of spiritual growth.  My understanding of New Age ideology and its detrimental effect on women's  Uves comes from several sources. My own  involvement includes extensive reading of  New Age texts, a personal affiUation with  individuals and organizations such as est  and The Pursuit of ExceUence, and experience's with women with whom I have  worked.  There were two things that originaUy attracted me to the human potential or New  Age movement: the promise of a way to gain  more power over my personal Ufe, and an attempt to have my spiritual needs met. From  the very beginning, my contact with New  Age groups resulted in a great deal of ambiguity. While the groups offered me a means  of exploring my spirituality, they also promoted many ideas that were in direct opposition to my feminist beUefs.  The result of this was incredible internal  conflict. Although I would read books and  attend lectures and selectively edit out what  I found objectionable, I found it was unsafe  to voice feminist concerns. After several attempts at chaUenging sexist attitudes, and  being told I obviously didn't understand,  I began to sit in sUence. Large groups of  people who hold simUar beUefs can be extremely intimidating to anyone who challenges those beUefs. I found myself sitting  in sUence as a woman seminar leader Ulustrated how women who are raped walk—it's  aU in how you swing your arms. I was witness to a 3-month infant being rolfed (a kind  of massage). As the infant screamed in pain  the male psychologist informed the mother  it was her fault her baby had to suffer, that  this was the only way the baby could be free  of the mother's negative energy.  When I attempted to intercede I was told  I didn't understand and was forced to leave.  (When I caUed the Ministry of Human Resources and reported what I had witnessed,  ...a women who is  being battered is  encouraged to  accept that she...  is 100% responsible  [for the abuse]  I was told no mother would stand by and  watch her baby be hurt.)  In an est seminar I heard a young woman  say: "I now accept that I was fuUy responsible for the fact that my father raped me  at the age of three. I realize that I seduced  him."  Through the proliferation of books, workshops, seminars and a variety of non-  traditional therapies, New Age beUefs are  becoming generally acceptable to society  at large. I want to draw attention to the  dangers inherent in New Age ideology and  hopefuUy mobUize other women who may  share some of my concerns in openly challenging this behef system.  I would also Uke to increase the awareness  of women who work in organizations that  support women. Like myself, those workers are probably deaUng with women who—  besides being raped, or battered, or sexuaUy  abused as a chUd—are being further victimized by New Age ideas that they encounter  through friends, books, groups or seminars.  Buzz Words = Blame Words  The catch words or phrases of the New Age  movement include: Create—as in you create your own reality; Responsibility—as in  you are 100 percent responsible for everything; Chose—as in you chose your par-  the abuser to herself. The language is different, the spiritual trappings are different but  the message is the same and the result is the  same—the woman is further victimized.  The idea of "creating one's reality" includes the yuppie in KitsUano and single  mom on welfare in a downtown hotel. It includes the miUions of Jews who died in Nazi  concentration camps and the chUdren dying  of starvation throughout the world. It includes the women who Uve in a misogynist,  patriarchal society where they are raped  and beaten. Everyone has created their own  reality and is therefore totaUy responsible  for whatever they have experienced.  ents, your sex, and the Ufe experiences you  have had; There just is—as in there is no  good or evU, there just is; Negativity—as  in negative emotions, negative energy, negative thoughts.  Therefore, whether it is an abusive relationship, the death of a chUd, or a Ufe  threatening disease, you created it, you are  100 percent responsible for it because you  choose it and it isn't good or bad anyway. So  let's not blame anyone because that's negative and wUl only create more negativity in  your Ufe.  Consider the impUcations of this beUef  system on a battered woman. From a New  Age perspective a women who is being battered is encouraged to accept that she, and  she alone, is 100 percent responsible for being in the abusive relationship. It is her negative beUef system that created the abuser  and if she changes her beUefs the abuse  wUl cease. Further, she would not have created the abuse if there wasn't something she  needed to learn from it. The abuse is, in  fact, part of her spiritual growth.  So instead of looking at the man's behaviour in terms of the pain he is causing, or how he is degrading, humUiating and  abusing her, she views it as an opportunity.  Now, that opportunity may be to "work  out" some abuse she had inflicted on someone in a past Ufe (e.g. she was a man in a  past Ufe who beat women and now must experience that pain); or it may be a lesson  that her soul decided she needed to learn  prior to entering this Ufe (don't ask why,  the soul knows and that is all that is important); or she needs to understand that men  do what they do to women because women  want them to.  In actuality, what this thinking does is  what society has been doing for centuries:  blame the woman for abuse. It says the  abuse is for her own good. It shifts her attention from the inappropriate behaviour of  Although there is a great deal of emphasis on responsibiUty, the New Age beUef system actuaUy absolves the individual  of any moral, social or poUtical responsibU-  ity. Although New Age practitioners preach  awareness, the injustice and inequaUty that  exists in society need not be questioned. Although "reaUty" is talked about, the reaUty  of our Uves is denied.  New Age thinking says there is no good  or evU, there just is. This beUef is based on  the idea that your reaction to an event determines your experience, not the event it-  seH. Hence, a woman's reaction to rape determines whether it is terrifying or degrading or pleasant. She created it because it was  a lesson she needed to learn, so how can she  possibly blame the rapist who isn't good or  bad, but just is?  Negative feehngs are shunned by these  spiritual eUtists. Anger, fear, resentment  and criticism are viewed as forms of blaming others and not taking responsibiUty for  one's own Ufe.  For example, anger attracts more anger,  fear attracts the thing you fear. So if a  woman is angry because her husband did  not let her know he would be late for dinner, then it is her fault if he gets angry and  hits her. If a woman fears being raped, then  it is her fear that creates the rape.  "Forgiveness" is also highly promoted.  The Course of Miracles says one must be  wUUng to forgive, to understand that the  other person is also in pain, that they were  doing the best they could.  The impact of this type of thinking on  women's Uves is frightening. If we beUeve  we create our reaUty, we begin to view the  individuals who enter our Uves as agents of  our destiny, thus leaving ourselves open to  aU forms of abuse.  The sad truth is that women are attracted to New Age ideology because of its  promise of personal power and spiritual fulfillment. However, instead of gaining personal power, women are left even more vulnerable. If a woman is not in touch wjth her  anger or fear, how can she recognize danger  and protect herself. If she beUeves she is responsible for being raped by her father, how  can she begin the necessary healing which  involves placing the blame on her father,  getting angry, reexperiencing the pain, and  expressing the resentments for what it has  done to her Ufe.  To embrace an ideology that views  rapists, batterers, and chUd molesters as  agents of spiritual development and deserving of our unquestioning compassion and  forgiveness is the ultimate insanity. To allow those beUefs to go unchallenged is to  leave women open and vulnerable to further  abuse and exploitation.  Interestingly, the founders or heads of  New Age organizations are exclusively men:  Werner Ehrhardt (est}; Randy Love (The  Pursuit of ExceUence); Lenord Orr (Re-  birthing); Justin SterUng (Men Sex and  Power, Women Sex and Power). This is  not to say that women are absent from the  arena. There is Shakti Gawain, Louise L.  Hay and of course Shirley MacLaine. But  you can trace just about everything they say  back to one of these male gurus or a male  entity "channeled" from the spirit world.  New Age ideas and values are consistent  with right-wing poUtical values, taking the  idea of individual responsibiUty to the point  of absurdity. Victims, the oppressed and  the poor are blamed for abuse, oppression,  poverty, inequaUty and injustice. New Age  ideology is simply right-wing, patriarchal  values packaged in spiritual saran wrap. The  blame is there, the misogyny is there, the  oppression is there. Maybe too many women  don't see this because it is so obvious.  If we do not challenge the beUef that  there are no victims or victimizers, that  good and evil do not exist, that a woman  is responsible for whatever happens to her,  then we tacitly condone the continued oppression of women. We betray the women  who have dedicated their Uves to fighting  the injustice of a misogynist patriarchal culture, a culture that has aUowed rape, battering and incest. New Age ideology is a new  weapon of patriarchy, and this is a caU to  battle.  KINESIS  November 90 NEWS  by Millie Strom  GaU Beck's ceUular phone never leaves  her side. Beck is not an executive waiting  for a business caU, but a mother awaiting  a call from the daughter she surrendered to  adoption 22 years ago.  This year, on her daughter's birthday,  Beck ran ads in Toronto area newspapers in  the hope that, at last, she wUl find her. Her  search is eight years old—a search of pouring through micro-fiche files of old newspapers and directories; calls to the Ontario  Ministry Adoption Unit; contacting editors  for exposure; and foUowing leads, no matter how smaU. Beck is frustrated that, when  placing classifieds, some publications do not  permit printing her chUd's full birth name  and, in some cases, wUl not print it at aU.  Beck wonders about her daughter: "Does  she feel rejected—is she angry at me? Is she  weU? Is she aUve?"  These are some of the questions that torment birth mothers such as GaU Beck over  the years. Contrary to what birth mothers were told by the professionals who arranged their adoptions, they do not forget  their chUdren.  A glance in most daily newspapers at  Adoption  Opening records, opening lives  the Information Wanted and People Finders classifieds wUl find two to five ads  in many editions, placed by birth mothers and adoptees searching for each other.  Once sUent, birth parents, adoptees, as weU  as some adoptive parents, are challenging  Canada's policies which keep adoption information secret from the parties involved.  But records were not always closed, and  some countries never closed their records:  Finland, HoUand, Israel and Scotland. Be  fore closure in New Zealand, the adoptee's  legal name was hyphenated with the birth  mother's last name.  Other countries, one after the other,  are unlocking their sealed records—a move  away from secrecy and denial. England  (1975), New Zealand (1985), most states of  AustraUa (1985-1990) including New South  Wales, and the state of HawaU (1990),  have passed legislation that aUows access to  adoption information by adoptees and birth  parents when the adoptee reaches the age of  majority. The laws also provide that a veto  may be placed if one party does not wish to  be contacted.  Closure of records came about during  the 40s and 50s. The "complete break theory" (influenced by the Freudian psychody-  namic theory of personahty) claimed that  chUdren need to be completely severed from  their original family in order to integrate  the chUd into the new family.  According to the authors of The Adoption Triangle, closure was simply to prevent intrusion by uninvolved persons such as  reporters and unscrupulous relatives; sealing the records would provide a safeguard  for adoptive famiUes.  Adoptees who  searched were viewed  as renegades,  disloyal to their family  IronicaUy, this secrecy thwarted research  on the effects of adoption on the birth  mother and adoptee. And, adoptees who  searched were viewed as renegades, disloyal  to their family. Adoptive parents felt they  had faded.  Jean Paton, an adoptee and social  worker, was the first person to speak out  on the secrecy of adoption.

She is now 80 years old; 46 years  ago she walked into court offices in Detroit to see her adoption file. A few years  later, she returned for more detaUs in order to search for her birth mother—but the  records had been closed.  Paton asserts: "An adopted person  should be left to their own wisdom as to  what to do with the information. Denying  adoptees access to information keeps them  as adopted chUdren, never attaining adult  status in the eyes of society."  The other concern is the assumption that  birth mothers insisted on confidentiahty.  Betty Jean Lifton, adoptee, social worker  and author of Lost and Found claims:  "The birth mother's need for confidentiahty  is a myth; they were given no choice about  the issue of confidentiaUty." Lifton found  that lobby groups against access to information were adoptive parents and conservative adoption agencies. She says: "Adoptive  parents are more afraid of losing their chUdren than birth mothers are afraid of being  found."  Mary Iwaneck, internationally renowned  expert on adoption information, was commissioned to report to the Social Committee on Social Issues in New South Wales,  AustraUa. Her research shows only 4 to  5 percent of birth mothers wish no contact. Furthermore, in New Zealand, many  birth mothers who placed vetoes were wUling to have contact when reassured that the  adoptee was not seeking retaliation.  The Adoption Triangle, published in  1978, was one of the first studies on birth  mothers. The authors conclude that information and contact is a humane and effective way of reUeving emotional stress, a result of the loss.  Current poUcies do not guarantee parties  absolute anonymity, anyway. Determined  birth parents and adoptees have been reuniting for decades.  Canada presently has provincial registries where parties can register for contact. Most are passive registries (parties register and wait for a match). Ontario and  Quebec have active registries (the province  wUl search on behalf of the adoptee). UntU  1988 Ontario required that adult adoptees  must have their adoptive parents consent to  register.  However, the registries are ineffective:  they are not advertised, and under-staffed,  and deceased relatives (obviously) cannot  register. These factors result in a very low  rate of matches and a long wait—one to  eight years depending on the province.  Activists for adoption reform see education as the key to overcoming the myths and  ignorance surrounding adoption.  New Zealand's access to adoption information law was enacted in 1985 after a nine  year process. Since then over 8,000 reunions  have occurred. Only ten percent of these resulted in rejection by one party, and half of  those ten percent found acceptance after a  "The birth mother's  need for confidentiality  is a myth; they were  given no choice..."  year or so. Fifty percent have ongoing relationships, whUe 30 percent were satisfiedl  with information and Uttle contact.  During the nine years, the public, professionals and elected representatives were educated on adoption issues. Extensive media  coverage of the issue helped diminish the secrecy around adoption. By the time the bill  became law, 95 percent of birth parents and  adoptees and 50 percent of adoptive parents  agreed with access to information.  The most reluctant party in the adoption  triangle to endorse access to information—  the adoptive parents—can be reassured  with the results of reunion: they do not lose  their chUdren. Iwaneck cites evidence that:  "The quality of the relationship between  adoptive parents and their adult chUdren is  enhanced through reunions. Alienation  occur and appears to be in situations where  adoptive parents have not accepted the loss  of their infertUity."  Trudy Denton of the Adoptive Parents  Association of BC finds that "when adoptive parents are used to a closed system,  some would feel an insecurity [about access]." Although APA's membership, in a  poU five years ago, preferred a passive registry (such as in BC), "now they lean towards more openness," says Denton.  The new laws in New Zealand accelerated a greater change in openness regarding  adoption. Adoptions are now often done  an open basis. The birth mother selects the  parents and together they determine the degree of contact. Single women and lesbians  can adopt, but the present laws prohibit gay  men.  But New Zealand, in fact, has a very low  rate of adoption due in part to the support  offered by the state to the mother for six  years (through the Domestic Services Benefit, the same grant aUowed for widows with  chUdren) and the provision of ample day  care.  Birth mother Beck, cellular phone in  hand, expressed her emotions at a recent Missing Pieces Thru Adoption support group meeting in Surrey, BC. Her eight  year search means time away from her two  younger chUdren—something she feels angry about. She questions the sealed records  poUcy: "My daughter is an adult now. What  is my crime? Even a convicted murderer has  access to his famUy."  Birth mothers may have surrendered  their parental rights—but they never gave  up the love for their chUdren.  ^      10  l\INESIS     November 90 /////////////////////////////////////S/////////////////SS//////////////S/////////////////////////////////  ///////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////^^^^^  International  Nicaragua  Going from bad to worse  by Sandra Ramos  translated by Cyndi Mellon  In 1987, women in the Sandinista  Workers' Federation (CST), the largest  trade union federation in Nicaragua,  organized the Women's Secretariat to  address the problems they faced as female workers. Since that time, women  have achieved the incorporation of  Women's Secretariats at the local and  regional levels and on the national trade  union executive boards of the CST.  Sandra Ramos, director of the CST's  Women's Secretariat, toured BC in October, a guest of the Trade Union  Group. Since the February electoral defeat of the Sandinista government, the  new rulers of Nicaragua (UNO) have  embarked on the wholesale dismantling  of the labour code, the privatization of  industry, government services and agriculture, and the elimination of student  grants and community health services.  On September 15, Ramos gave a  workshop where she specifically addressed the concerns of Nicaraguan  women. The following is a transcript of  the talk, prepared by Lorri Rudland.  The revolution worked hard to create an  open space for women, but the [union] participation of women can be dated back to  the struggle against Somoza. Before the revolution, there were only seven unions. Before the revolution, no one had the experience of having women trade unionists.  Many working women are single parent  mothers with five to seven chUdren. They  face the problem of the double workday,  paternal irresponsibiUty and finding chUd-  caie. Our union leaders put very Uttle energy into solving these problems so in 1987  —due to the pressure of women—our federation formed a women's secretariat. From  that point we have fought to make the incorporation of women into the union movement part of the work of the union movement.  But the pressures are so great in the  industries [where women work]—textUes,  footwear, food packing, pharmaceuticals,  meat packing and plastics. There are  very few women in industry doing non-  traditional work. The economic situation  is now hitting women especiaUy hard because these sectors are very vulnerable. The  National Opposition Union [the governing  coaUtion—UNO] talks about 15,000 workers losing jobs—half are women.  There are stiU many sexist arguments  used to keep women out of non-traditional  work. For example, because women make  clothes at home, they can sew garments; because women do the cooking, they can work  at food packing. In times of economic recession therefore, women can be laid off first.  Business says they'll keep the most experienced and best trained. Women usuaUy  have the least training and the least education. They say things Uke, "we're always  late," because we can't find chUdcare, or we  had to go to the gynecologist or take the  kids to the doctor.  Men have been the most privUeged in  our society. Boys get to go to school,  girls have to learn to cook to help their  husbands. Women have to be secretaries,  nurses, teachers. If they aspire to a different  job, they'U become mascuUne because those  jobs are not feminine. There is a lack of  sex education and famUy planning. Lots of  young girls get pregnant, and as young single parent mothers have to find work. Young  girls have only one year of high school when  they enter the labour market, and they become stuck at that level.  Not that we don't want to advance or  that we can't. We want to and we can, but  no one helps us to overcome these obstacles.  Add to that a woman being a union leader,  and that's a lot of work. Men say we don't  get trained because we don't want to, or we  don't do leadership in the union because we  don't want to. But what have they done to  create opportunities?  According to UNO, women have no business organizing—that destroys the family  unit. They also want to take away sex education in school. They say we need to teach  Civics and Morals, the same program we  had under Somoza [the deposed dictator of  Nicaragua]. It was obUgatory then. The government is now starting a campaign against  abortion on television, based on reUgion,  saying abortion is a mortal sin, that it is  murder.  The statistics say that the highest number of deaths of women in Nicaragua are  from botched abortions, because all abortions are Ulegal in Nicaragua. And there  are currently no contraceptives avaUable—  the official form of birth control is stiU the  rhythm method. At privately-owned pharmacies, condoms are beginning to appear.  STD's are a serious problem^ Before, there  were health centres where women could go.  Before, I could go the minister of health and  say, we need a doctor because we have a  seribus health problem. And we would get  one, because we had an affiance. We could  find some one to Usten to us. But now we  get nothing.  UNO has no interest in programs for  women nor are they interested in women's  emancipation. They are opposed to it.  Before the February election, President  Chamorro said she would put programs into  place to get women back into the home with  their husbands. But women say, "Where are  these men? I'm alone with five chUdren."  At a plywood factory which is at the top  of the Ust for privatization, women are supporting the struggle against privatization  because they know the old owner wUl come  back and they'U be fired. We are not talking about advancing women's struggle, we  are trying to maintain the gains we won in  10 years of revolution.  The health of our chUdren is a serious issue. There has been an increase in infant  mortality since the UNO victory. This year  more than 130,000 chUdren have died. They  are dying of diseases we worked hard to  control: poUo, measles, infant viruses, diarrhoea, hunger and malnutrition. At this moment, measles is at an epidemic level. ChUdren are dying, adults too are dying of it.  There has been  an increase in  infant mortality  since the UNO  victory  In May this year, a textUe worker earned  a salary of 1M cordobas a week. This equals  one doUar. So she is earning $4 per month.  Salaries are $20 to $50 per month. State-  workers have the best salary now, but even  that is not enough to Uve on. It costs $17(1  per month for the basic necessities.  There have been 35 devaluations since  AprU 25th. Prices change every day. There  are people who eat once a day and some  people who don't eat at aU. The only women  who are weU off are the President and the  ones who have money. AU we have as workers is the power of our labour. H that is  badly paid, what do we do?

The following is an excerpt from the talk Sandra Ramos gave on Sept. 14 at  Vancouver's Maritime Centre. Transcribed by Megan Ardyche.  It's so difficult for working people, for unemployed people, for women who are home-  makers, and for men who assume responsibiUty in their homes. In the last quarter of 1988,  the average inflation rate was 97 percent a month. In the last part of 1989, it went down  to 16 percent. So you can see how much it fluctuates. With the electoral defeat in February 1990—in the second quarter of this year—the inflation was back up to 81 percent. This  government has devalued our money 35 times. Thirty-five devaluations in four months of  government. Two devaluations a week. Our government has coUapsed...  You know what they [the US] want to do with us now? Turn us into their garbage  dump—a nuclear waste dumping ground. There are plans to bring nuclear waste to the  Atlantic coast of our country. That's what they want to turn Central America into. We've  got an example. The Americans invaded Panama; they massacred people, and they destroyed the country. And there's the Panamanian president begging the United States to  give it 4 cents to keep their government going.  So with those kinds of examples, what is this UNO government going to do? They're  not going to invest their capital in Central America. Their strategy is to convert us into a  dump, for the gringo and who else, who knows?  KINESIS  November 90 ore Than Sexisf.  The use of sex selection—and other reproductive  technologies—reveals much more than sexism.  Issues of race and class are also front and centre.  by Sunera Thobani  On the 17th of August, 1990, an advertisement appeared in The Link promoting the use of an ultrasound scanning technique to determine the sex of a fetus as  early as 12 weeks into a pregnancy. The  Link is an Indo-Canadian community newspaper based in Vancouver, and the advertisement was placed by a doctor from California, Dr. John D. Stephens. Stephens is  based in San Jose and operates four chnics, one of which—Koala Labs—is located  in Blaine, Washington. Blaine is within easy  driving distance of Vancouver.  The fee charged for this patented scanning technique is $500 US. Stephens claims  100 percent accuracy in his determination  of the sex of the fetus, an assertion that has  been challenged by other doctors who conduct ultrasound tests. In an advertisement  written in Punjabi and maUed to gynecologists and members of the Indo-Canadian  community in British Columbia, Stephens  offers a free video recording of the ultrasound to prospective cUents.  The Vancouver Sun reported in September that 10,000 Indo-Canadians were being targeted by Stephens in a direct maU  campaign. An article also appeared in Kinesis which mentioned this doctor's targeting of Indo-Canadian women (October  1990: "Sex selection: the ultimate sexist  act").  A number of issues are raised by this  incident and the manner in which it has  been reported. Let us begin by looking at  the larger issues involved here. Sex selection  techniques are part of the package of reproductive technologies, and can only be fully  understood within the context of this totality. Ultrasound, the technique this particular doctor is promoting, is also used as part  of the in-vitro fertiUzation process, for detecting ectopic pregnancies, fetal deformations, etc.  So not only are reproductive technologies being developed as spin-offs from each  other, they are also intrinsicaUy related in  that they extend control over women's reproductive abiUties by the scientific and  medical community.  Reproductive technologies are being presented as being an issue of a woman's right  to choice, the choice that wUl make it possible for women to design and plan the making of their famiUes, of their chUdren.  In reality, these technologies have very  Uttle to do with women's choice. The technologies have to be understood within the  context of the power relations of our world  today and, coUectively, women have very  Uttle power in this world. Certain groups  of women, depending on their race and  class, do have relatively more power than  other groups of women. Reproductive technologies target all women, although specific  groups of women are being targeted with  specific techniques which reflect these divisions of race and class among women.  Techniques such as in-vitro fertiUzation and surrogacy, example, are directed  towards white, middle and upper class  women. With surrogacy costing about  $30,000 US only a particular group of  women have access to it. These women have  gone out and hired "surrogate mothers" to  bear chUdren who are contractuaUy turned  over to them upon birth. The Baby M case  is a tragic example of the consequences for  the women who are so hired (see Kinesis September 1990, pg. 8). The "surrogate  mothers" who are hired are working class  and poor women. With the development of  gestational surrogacy, we wUl increasingly  see women of colour being drawn into surrogacy.  These tests are often used to detect disabiUties in the fetus. In the age of "designer  babies," the characteristics of every group  of peoples who are devalued in our world  today are deemed undesirable and sufficient  cause for extermination. Bhooma Bhayana,  a physician, says she was "never taught that  being female was a genetic Ulness." We are  being taught that now: being born female is  to be devalued in every community in Canadian society today. With regard to femicide,  consider the foUowing:  • Caucasians in North America are said  to have "a preference that the first-born  chUd be male," according to recent report of the Vanier Institute of the FamUy  in Ottawa.  • In Britain, a "made to order" male infant  was born in August, 1986. When reported  in the Daily Express, a doctor claimed  his chnic was "swamped" with similar requests for boys.  The issue of reproductive technologies  has the potential to force the white  feminist movement to challenge  its own privilege...  Gestational surrogacy makes it possible  for a woman's egg to be extracted from  her body, then fertilized by sperm and  implanted into the womb of a "surrogate  mother." This "surrogate mother" has no  genetic relation to the embryo. If the egg  and sperm donors are both white, the "surrogate mother" can potentiaUy be a woman  of colour without the embryo also being ge-  neticaUy of mixed race. The experience of  Anna Johnson, a Black women in CaUfor-  nia who recently lost the first round of a  custody battle for the baby she gave birth  to in this arrangement, is a sign of the kind  of exploitation women of colour wUl increasingly face.  On the other hand, sex selection, in the  Stephens case, is targeting Indo-Canadian  women. Techniques that determine the sex  of the fetus have been the prelude to the  practice of femicide—the aborting of female fetuses on the basis of their sex. Yet  we know that it is not only Indo-Canadian  women who undergo the use of these techniques.  • The use of abortion for sex selection in  Pennsylvania has been banned in a bid  that went into effect in January, 1990.  • In Denmark, a woman demanded an  abortion when she discovered the fetus  she was carrying was female. As abortions are avaUable on demand in Denmark untU 12 weeks, doctors presently  cannot disclose the sex of the fetus untU  after 12 weeks.  • A doctor who has sex selection chnics in  46 countries in Europe, America, Asia  and Latin America stated that of 263  couples who had approached him, 248 selected to have boys.  Clearly it is not only women of Indian origins and their use of sex selection who are  provoking this kind of response aU over the  world. Yet whUe these practices occur in the  mainstream white community too, the myth  being created is that only Third World  communities—the Indian community in this  case—practice femicide. Furthermore, femicide by selective abortion is now presented  as part of our "culture."  We don't know how widespread the use  of sex selection techniques is in the Indo-  Canadian community in British Columbia.  What we do know is that promoting them in  this manner only serves to increase the extent to which they are being used. We don't  know how widespread the use of these techniques is in other communities in Canadian  society either. What we do know is that it  happens at a scale that makes possible the  analysis such as that of the Vanier Institute.  What the advertisement in The Link  has done is revive a racist stereotype of Indian culture, a stereotype that has time and  time again stated that such crimes against  women are an inherent feature of our culture.  Stephens was quoted in the Vancouver  Sun as saying: "Why should I cut my financial throat? Why should I have to go out on  my own to change their cultural attitudes?"  Since colonial times, peoples of colour and  our cultures have been under attack. The  racist stereotyping of our cultures mystifies the actual power relations in the world  by blaming everything upon the "backwardness" of these cultures. Here we have a doctor who is making money by targeting our  community with technologies that we have  had no hand in fashioning and over which  we have no control, and who then justifies  himself by blaming us for the very practices  which exploit and devalue us further.  Of course women are oppressed and exploited in the Indian community. But in  which society today are women not exploited, oppressed and devalued? I am  not condoning this exploitation of women.  What I am interested in is challenging the  racist underpinnings of both the advertisement and the articles written about it.  The Indo-Canadian community is not a  monoUth with identical attitudes and practices. If there are people in our communities  who defend such practices, there are many  who are outraged and determined to stop it.  Again and again, we are quoted the statistics of this practice in India. Rarely do we  hear of the women's movement in India and  the mihtant activism around this issue.  Again and again we hear of the backwardness of our culture which is to be blamed  for women's exploitation in our community.  Rarely do we heax how patriarchal relations  within the Indo-Canadian community are  transformed and strengthened through the  workings of the Canadian patriarchal and  racist state and economy.  Reproductive technologies are directed at  aU women. They serve to increase the control by the racist, patriarchal scientific and  medical communities over women's reproductive abiUties. The control of women's reproductive abihty and sexuaUty, the control  of women's bodies, is a cornerstone of patriarchal power. We are seeing the extension of  this patriarchal control over women's bodies  through the development of the technology.  As women of colour, we have learnt  lessons from our history. We recognize that  this is not an issue of a woman's right to  choice.  We have cleaned white women's houses,  we have sexuaUy served their white husbands. We have wiped their babies' bottoms  and we have cleaned their toilets. With the  development of the reproductive technology  that allows gestational surrogacy, we will  also be made to carry their chUdren whUe  they are busy with their professions and careers and writing books and articles about  us. It is no wonder then, that the discussion of this particular technology continues  to focus on our culture only.  Understanding the full consequences of  reproductive technologies is an urgent matter. For women of colour, it is an issue of Ufe  and death. These technologies make possible the realization of the goals of the eugenics movement, the technologicaUy engineered reproduction of a "superior" race of  people. We know that this "superior race"  wUl be defined by the dominant values of a  racist, patriarchal, imperiaUst society. The  Nazis taught the world what this would  mean in human terms. What is truly alarming is that these technologies are already  avaUable in the marketplace of scientifically-  controlled human reproduction.  The issue of reproductive technologies  has the potential to force the white feminist movement to challenge its own privileges: to identify the potential threat to aU  women as weU as to recognize their complicity in the continued exploitation of women  of colour. For women of colour, the threat  of racist and sexist extermination is real.  Thus we recognize the potential threat these  technologies present toward aU women. We  also see how we are being used against each  other yet again, both by the racist blaming of our cultures for this crime against  women, and also by being made to bear  the brunt of the oppression and exploitation that can privUege white and middle-  class women. These women can continue to  present this as an issue of woman's choice.  To persist in defining the problem of reproductive technologies as being specific to  certain races and cultural groups wUl only  demonstrate the white feminist movement's  compUcity with the hierarchy of power relations. Reproductive technologies are recreating the divisions that already exist  among women along the Unes of race and  class. It is crucial to recognize this and to  act upon this recognition.  Indo-Canadian women have taken up the  fight against Stephens; we are stiU waiting  for other groups of women to take up this  fight with us. We put pressure on The Link  whose editor withdrew the ad and stated he  wUl not reprint it. The ads also appeared in  stores that serve the Indo-Canadian community. Women have approached owners of  some stores and asked that these ads be  removed. Indradhanush, a local community  television program, presented a discussion  of this incident and some of the larger issues involved. We are also in the process  of preparing a brief for the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies.  Our brief wUl contain specific recommendations regarding sex selection techniques.  Much remains to be done by feminists  everywhere. In the case of this doctor, he  is based in California and operates out of  Washington. Women's organizations there  can take up this issue and bring pressure  from their communities on Stephens. However, women's organizations wiU only take  up this fight if and when they realize this is  their issue too.  12 l<|NESIS  November 90  KINESIS  November 90 Arts  From Cuba:  Stark visuals,  subversive art  by Sandra Gillespie  Prohibition, eroticism, traditions, taboos,  stereotypes and contradictions.  These were the key issues dealt with by  visiting Cuban artist Magdalena Campos in  her September talk at the Video In. Working with a translator, Campos provided the  audience with a shde and video presentation  of her work from art school graduation in  1985 to the present. Although Campos' media varied greatly in this period to include  painting, installation and performance, her  subject matter remained consistent—the  exploration of eroticism within the specific  conjuncture of African, European and Latin  American civffizations known to the world  as Cuban culture.  Campos describes what she terms a "permanent contradiction" between the stereotype of Cuban culture as overtly sexual and  erotic, and the actual experience of growing  up in a society characterized by the strong  traditions and strict taboos inherent in a  mixture of Spanish CathoUcism and African  culture.  It is not surprising then that some of  her earliest work deals with the Christian  bible as an historical text and attempts to  re-interpret bibUcal icons, such as the apple, as symbols of transgression. Campos  takes up pre-European contact mythology,  legends and folk stories in a similar fashion. She dismantles each and uses their distinctive vocabularies to offer an alternative,  subversive reading of eroticism and seduction in both a figurative and abstract mode.  L  A Stroll Down Demo Lane  The Heidi Chronicles is a Pulitzer Prize and Tony award-winning play coming  to the Vancouver Playhouse. The central character is feminist art curator Heidi  Holland, whose sense of self is buffeted by a cast of friends and lovers during the  political—and personal—tumult of the 60s-80s in the United States.  The play is written by New Yorker Wendy Wasserstein and directed by Svetlana  Zylin, a UBC graduate who began her career in Vancouver and now is the artistic  director at Playwrights' Workshop in Montreal. Marilyn Norry stars as Heidi.  The Heidi Chronicles has been called powerful and humourous, and the Vancouver  Playhouse production runs November 20 to December 15, with a Seniors' Matinee  on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:30 p.m.  A related series, for example, examines  the numerous indigenous proverbs, songs  and phrases that sexuaUze food in general  and fruit in particular. In one work, Campos ironicaUy reveals what is not-so-subtly  hidden in the songs by presenting a papaya  (traditionaUy referred to as a woman's sex)  not in a basket or on a windowsUl, but lying large, ripe and open on a pUlow.  In 1986 Campos directed her attention  to discussions of sexuaUty as manipulative  of women. She makes the personal poUtical through large-scale imagery of internal  female anatomy. Her acryUc on wood representation of vaginas, fallopian tubes and  uteri explores the shifting boundaries between the private and public, making it an  issue through cool, factual rendering and  heroic size.  This subversion of mainstream images  continued in the works shown in her 1989  Havana exhibit, "Island." The show itself is  an investigation of a series of problems that  stem from Cuba's geographical location and  its socio-poUtical history, both pre- and  post-revolutionary. Works such as "Black  Cedar, White Cedar, Dangerous Species"  and "Options for the Myth" not only reveal  the difficulty of obtaining artist's materials  in Cuba (the first work is made solely of  wood) and the challenges that presents, but  also the omnipresence of racism and homophobia. According to law and the Marxist  ideology on which modern Cuban society is  founded, aU individuals have equal opportunity regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. In practice, however, the situation is much different and Campos incisively shows the tensions by means of stark  visuals and provocative assemblage.  In these later pieces and in a 1988 performance video, "Rites of Initiation," Campos  concentrates on spiritual legends and popular reUgious rituals as a means of alternative re-imaging and re-valuing of the female  body—specificaUy the Black female body.  Campos provided a wider positioning of this  work two days later when she gave another  presentation at the Video In, this time on  contemporary Cuban woman artists.  In aU of Cuba there are only five weU-  known women artists (Campos herself was  the only female in an art school class of 35)  despite the fact that, since the revolution,  doors to non- traditional employment for  women have officiaUy been opened.  Of the women artists she was discussing  Campos was quick to point out that, whUe  they were producers of art, this did not  necessarUy imply that women's issues were  the subject matter of their work. In fact,  their concerns ranged from an exploration  of the physical presence of objects per se,  to a semiotic examination of the language of  art, to an investigation of rural myths about  pregnant women.  The overaU effect of Campos' presentation on the predominantly Canadian  audience was to make it clear that  Cuban women's art-making is complex, rich  and varied. Indeed, Cuban women artists  present a chaUenge to mainstream North  American feminists—to re-examine their  concept of what constitutes activist feminist  art practice.

During this time, I was given the opportunity to talk with Maya Chowdhry and  Seni Seneviratne, two of the three Black  women writers from Britain who had  collectively published a book of prose  and poems entitled, Putting in the Pickle  Where the Jam Should Be.  Raj Pannu: So, what inspired or compelled you to collaborate on writing your  book of poetry ?  Seni Seneviratne: We wanted to see  more writings by Asian women, in particular Asian women who were Uving in Britain.  We wanted to give a voice to those kinds  of experiences women were having, and encourage more Asian women to write—that  you didn't have to be famous or anything  kind of special or amazing to actually just  get some of your ideas down in print.  Maya Chowdhry: Also, to kind of challenge the writing of poetry and how it's supposed to be, to challenge hterary traditions  of: "This is poetry, this is prose, this is what  you put in a book, this is how it should  look."  Raj: I feel that I see an eclipse more  often than I see a book published by a  woman of colour. I was wondering how  you succeeded in getting your book published.  Maya: We thought we'd do a pamphlet.  So we investigated our local arts association  to get some funding to do that and ended  up talking to an organization called Write  Back which is attached to Sheffield City Libraries. We showed them some of our work  and they said: "Why don't you do a book  and we'll give you the grant to do it."  Seni: We had a lot of control about  exactly what went in, how it looked. We  didn't have to negotiate with publishers  about what the cover was Uke. We decided  it. We chose the printers and we chose the  Women's Co-op to do the printing.  Raj: What has been the response to  your book since it's been published—  especially in the UK?  Raj: You identify yourselves as Black  women. What, if any, are the connotations of "South Asian" women or  "women of colour" that you don't like ?  Maya: I don't think it's personally that I  particularly dishke those terms. "Women of  colour" is something that hasn't been used  in Britain because of the connotations of the  term "coloured" and that particular history  with it. I think, culturaUy, Asian women wUl  identify themselves as Asian, and African  and Caribbean women wUl identify themselves as Caribbean or whatever culturaUy.  But on a poUtical level when we say we want  to unite and fight basicaUy the same things,  then we would use that term Black women.  Raj: I remember that in a previous  conversation, I had asked you about  Black youth "rioting" in the UK. You  corrected me by telling me the appropriate word was "uprising" as opposed to  "rioting."  Seni: That Ulustrates really the way the  media—particularly the television media-  misinterprets what's happening. In particular, anything that's happening in relation  to Black people is misinterpreted and used  as a way of fostering racism. So the way  that something is reported on television and  the words chosen and the choice they make  of what pictures to show—I'm sure it's the  same here—feeds into all the racist stereotypes people have. When the uprisings were  going on in Brixton and in Birmingham,  they presented it on television [using] the  word "riot," representing people as mobs  and lawless and...  Maya: Subversive.  Seni: ...it was pohce harassment and poUce intimidation of people that had actually  pushed the people into making those kinds  of responses.  Raj: In North America and Britain,  sure enough, it's already hard enough  for a woman of colour to face the onslaught of racism and sexism on a daily  basis. What gave you the courage to  come out as lesbians knowing you would  have to face the additional menace of  homophobia?  Seni: WeU, I don't know what you mean  by coining out as lesbians. I don't really  want to be defined only in terms of my sexu-  We wanted to give voice to  those kinds of experiences women  were having, and encourage  more Asian women to write...  Seni: Obviously we've had a good response from Black women who've said, "Oh,  it's reaUy great because aU the time we're  looking for Asian women writers and it's  hard to find them."  Maya: But it's also a book that just  doesn't directly address Black women. It's  a book that directly addresses all women  because the writing in it is about being a  mother, about being a friend, being a lover,  being all those things which are common experiences that can be shared by a lot of peo-  pie.  Seni: And even men as weU. I mean,  I've been having people say to me that even  their sons read it, and really Uked the stuff  in it.  Raj: What attracted you to the Gay  Games and Literary Festival?  Seni: I knew somebody in Vancouver  who knew the Games were happening. We  just wrote off, to see if they [the organizers]  were interested and we really didn't think  anything would come of it. They wrote back  and said they would be prepared to pay airfare for us to come and take part in the  Literary Festival, which obviously we were  really pleased about. It's not often that  women Uke us get free air tickets to anywhere.  !'':,' V-}M,  Raj: Did you come to a certain point  in your life where writing had this hold  on you or has it been something recent ?  Or has this need to write always been  there as opposed to other forms of creative expression in your life?  Maya: I kind of wrote through my  teenage years to sort of keep myself aUve,  probably. I suppose in the last few years it's  been taken seriously as a form of expres-  sion...but it's not the only thing. I work as  a filmmaker and I often find that the words  aUty. I think you choose to open yourself up  to the people that you want to open yourself up to, and I'm not really into making  myself into some kind of symbol or figurehead for Asian lesbians.  I think, sometimes, we afl as Asian lesbians have a lot of courage to do what we  are doing regardless of whether we so-called  "come-out" or not and I think that's what  we should be talking about.  Maya: I'm out in certain aspects of my  Ufe and in certain aspects I'm not. I feel Uke  I've grown up with enough labels and to actually say, "Oh, add lesbian on the end of aU  those labels as weU," It's not Uke you have  to wear a particular badge on your lapel.  Maya Chowdry  Maya: It's a bit Uke winning a raffle.  Raj: During the Literary Festival,  there was a petition drawn up by a  group of writers who urged people to  sign in protest of the following conditions during the Games and Literary  Festival: The lack of venues that were  accessible for the physically disadvantaged; the lack of childcare; the high  price of tickets, especially for the Literary Festival; and, especially, at the  opening gala for the Literary Festival,  there were no people of colour invited  to read or speak. I was wondering what  your feelings about this were ?  Maya: We were involved with the group  of women who were drawing that up and  in fact, I don't think that Ust is enough.  In terms of the Literary Festival, having it  in a corporate academic buUding Uke Simon Fraser University is really off-putting  to people. I think that too often, things are  sacrificed for the sake of profit. And it—  the Literary Festival—we hear, was a profit-  making venture from beginning to end.  Seni: There was a get-together of women  of colour one evening during the Festival  and in some ways that was where the petition came out ot I felt annoyed about the  fact that instead of us being able to use  the time that we had—this sort of opportunity for us, being from England—to meet  Native Indian writers, to meet some Asian  Canadian writers and here we were wasting  the time we had together with those women  talking about what aU the organizers of the  Festival had done wrong and having to raise  it.  Maya: It felt Uke people wanted to come  and hear readings and that was somehow  unconnected to anything else—any other  poUtical struggle or anything else. That  somehow there was writing "here"—and everything else over there.  ,"'•-.•"'     .'  '<  won't do what I want them to—Pd rather  take a photograph of something.  Seni: I don't know when I started writing. There was a period in my Ufe when I  channeled a lot of my energies, in terms of  writing, into articles for poUtical newspapers, women's papers and things Uke that.  It's only in the last 10 or 11 years really that  I've started writing poetry again.  Raj: Finally, is there something I neglected to ask that you'd like to add?  Seni: It feels Uke we have just begun  to get information about communities we  never knew before. I mean, the Native Indian community is one where, yeah sure, in  theory we had all kinds of information about  what was happening, but in practice we  didn't really know underground what that  meant. We don't get enough information [in  the UK] and that felt Uke a really positive thing to have been able to meet some  of the Native women writers. And learning about the Japanese community here and  the things that happened to them during  the war. I just never knew about that. You  know, sometimes we have this reaUy simpUs-  tic way of looking at things and to really begin to understand all the different complex  ways that imperialism and colonialism have  worked and have been used against different communities.  Maya: The sort of hospitaUty and the  welcoming that we received [during the  Games], and also the opportunity to sit  down and talk about things of concern.  HopefuUy we've made a connection here.  It's by doing that that the real Unks wUl be  made between women of colour in different  parts of the world.  Raj: Thank you, Maya. Thank you,  Seni.  KINESIS  November 90 •ssss^s****ssssss$^  ARTS  Truth-telling  women found  in Strangers  by Sherrill Rowland  THE COMPANY OF STRANGERS  directed by Cynthia Scott  NFB, 1990  PubUcity for The Company of Strangers, a recently released film which has been  playing to deUghted festival audiences from  Venice to Vancouver, makes much of the  fact that seven members of a cast of eight  players are women whose ages range from  69 to 88 years. Ageist promotional Uterature for The Company of Strangers declares: "This is a film about being old. And  thinking young." I say this film is about being aUve and thinking clearly.  MicheUe Sweeney, in real Ufe a Montreal-  based jazz singer, is the young one. She's  the only member of the cast with previous  acting experience. Making first appearances  as performers are AUce Diabo, Winifred  Holden, Mary Meigs, Cissy Meddings, Beth  Webber, Constance Garneau and Catherine  Roche, who re-create their own characters  in front of the camera. The story-Une loosely  ties together the performers' contributions.  MicheUe plays the hired driver whose bus  breaks down on a remote side road, leaving her and her seven passengers stranded  in the Mont Tremblant region of Quebec.  The film's cinematographers make the  most of the shimmering midsummer countryside. MicheUe sprains her ankle and the  other women help her along as they hike  uphiU to an abandoned farmhouse where  they spend a couple of days together whUe  they decide how to get home again. By the  time help comes and the movie's over these  women have lovingly divested each other of  all pretense. They've fed and warmed and  entertained each other so successfuUy they  are no longer strangers to each other or to  the movie-goer.  The Company of Strangers, the sole  Canadian film invited to this year's Venice  International Film Festival, is a first feature movie for Academy Award-winning director Cynthia Scott. (She won in the short  documentary dance film category in 1984  for Flamenco at 5:15.) She and producer  David WUson put aside the prepared script  to make this innovative film, which features  real persons in fictional situations. WUson  says, "It was the women themselves who  reaUy decided where the film was going."  They create the dialogue and the action and  in the process they produce a witty and subversive pubUc statement about what it's Uke  to be aUve when you've Uved long enough to  grow older.  AUce's speaking voice is subtle and clear.  She plays a scene with Constance, who looks  out over the green hills and says she'd rather  die right there at the farmhouse than in a  nursing home or hospital. AUce repUes, "I'm  not going to die. I'm going fishing." After  retiring from years of work in a shoe factory, AUce worked for a few years as a cook  at the survival school at Kahnawake where  she Uves. Constance is a former radio broadcaster and women's rights activist.  In the scene where Cissy learns that Mary  is a lesbian, it's the real Cissy who says, £  "That's good, isn't it?" and worries about ^  how it was for Mary to have to hide be- J  hind the closet door. She asks, "Did you *.  write about it?" Mary says, "Not untU I was s  sixty. Then I started to talk and now I can't t  stop talking." AU the women in the film are  courageous talkers. Author Mary Meigs has  begun to write a book about the filming experience and about her feUow actors.  In a later scene, the players gather on  the front porch of the hiU-top house. Each  woman shouts in turn, her words echoing  over the lake below: "I'm alive." As each  actor spoke I beUeved what she said was absolutely true, no fooling. Who could doubt  it? Moment-by-moment, what these women  choose to say to each other rings true. This  is powerful stuff.  These women have worked hard to get to  a place where they can talk Uke this. The  getting of self-knowledge is hard work. The  getting of self-knowledge is always work in  Winifred Holden (left) and filmmaker Cynthia Scott  progress, Uke women's work which is never  done. At times it's invisible work. Yet in  time the achievement is clearly just that,  an achievement which is personal and social and poUtical. This kind of success isn't  strictly age-related. I think this film works  in good part because Cynthia Scott has  brought together women who've chosen to  pursue this knowledge. It's an attractive  choice and these are attractive women.  We're told that as a woman grows older  she ceases to be one of us and she becomes other, lesser, invisible, no longer im  passioned. The women who made this funny  and provocative film invite us to discover  for ourselves what to beUeve. Of her time  with these women, Cynthia Scott says, "1  stopped having any sense of Us and Them  and being old no longer seemed another  place."  I think that The Company of Strangers  isn't about other women and it isn't just  about old women. This is a movie about  women.  The Company of Strangers opened in  theatres across Canada late in October.  A playful journey  by Pat Feindel  WHITE ROOM  written and directed by Patricia Rozema  Vos Productions, 1990  Complete with prince vaUant and damsel  in distress, Patricia Rozema's White Room  is a Victorian gothic tale, deftly disguised as  a whimsical, contemporary fairy tale.  Victorian Uterature abounds with images  of women in white, both pure and tragic—  virginal, ghostly or mad. They wUt with  sickly paUor, or burn with the intensity of  white heat. Rozema draws on this legacy in  the imagery of the White Room and in particular evokes the Ufe of Emily Dickinson,  Victorian poet who wore only white and  spent a reclusive Ufe in her father's house,  struggling fiercely with a fragUe and often  fragmented identity.  Rozema deals with two paraUel dramas in  the film. One foUows a young man's quest  for creative inspiration, experience and self-  discovery; the other addresses the fragmented identity and troubled existence of  a successful female artist, a popular singer  and songwriter.  A woman's soothing narrative voice introduces us to our innocent hero, Norman  the Gentle (Maurice Godin), as he sings  in the church choir. The narrator tells us  that Norman spends much of his time riding his bicycle at night searching for meaning by spying on other people. He aspires to  be a writer and with notebook in hand, he  watches through darkly framed windows for  the raw material he hopes wUl animate his  pen.  In one house he has observed, there Uves  a woman who sings. One night Norman sees  a man enter the singer's house and brutally stab her to death. After doing nothing  to stop it, Norman flees in horror with the  woman's screams echoing in his ears.  As a parody of  fairy tale, the film  offers delightful  touches  Haunted by his inaction in the face of  murder, Norman leaves the secure comfort  of his parents' gingerbread home and sets  out in a shiny white Rambler (a guess, I  admit) to seek his fortune in The Big City.  There he meets Zelda (played by SheUa McCarthy of Rozema's first film, I've Heard  the Mermaids Singing), a flamboyant but  flaky aspiring Artist who offers him a job  running a newsstand and a mattress in her  colourful Uttle shack beside a slag heap.  That day's front page news is the murder of  a weU known pop singer, MadeUne X—the  very murder Norman has witnessed.  Making a guUt-ridden appearance at the  singer's funeral, Norman spies a striking  woman cloaked in black (Kate NeUigan) and  foUows her—or she lures him—to a secluded  rundown house outside the city, secreted behind a jungle of overgrown bushes and trees.  He offers himself as a gardener. She cautiously accepts.  A deUcately clumsy intimacy develops  between this laconic woman and her enthusiastic novice gardener. Norman tames  the grounds and protects Jane from intruders. Jane responds to his awkward presence  guardedly, but with composure and gentle reassurance. To Norman, Jane presents  mystery, knowledge, experience, vulnerabdity, sexuaUty. To Jane, he offers both safety  and danger, strength and helplessness.  Norman's "tragic flaw" is his need to  know, his urge to trespass, to observe and  experience others whUe remaining unseen  and aloot He secretly watches Jane and discovers that she disappears into a hidden  room at night (the white room of the title).  See ROOM page 18  ie KINESIS  November 90 Arts  ^^^*22*m2m**2*2jm^  In South Africa:  The culture of resistance  by Zaniub Verjee  Songololo: Voices of Change is a new  feature film celebrating Black resistance culture in South Africa. The role of popular  culture in South Africa is seen through the  voices and Uves of two cultural activists,  Gcina Mhlophe and Mzwakhe MbuU.  In a two-hour interview with South  African-born director Marianne Kaplan, the  issues of cultural representation, difficulties  of filming in South Africa, censorship and  much more was discussed. Kaplan has Uved  in Canada for eight years and is a graduate  of the EmUy Carr CoUege of Art.  Zaniub Verjee: What really inspired  and moved you to make the film ?  Marianne Kaplan: I have an intense relationship with South Africa, still. I am way  more in tune with South African poUtics  than I am with Canadian poUtics. I foUow  them acutely and I have always had a real  love of South African culture. The first music I ever heard in my Ufe was Black music  and I heard it because I was tied to the back  of my Black nanny. That's the first music  that I knew and that's the music that is in  my blood. So that is a very deep connection  for me.  I am not a poUtical animal—I am not  the sort of person that would make poUtical speeches. I felt that the way I could  contribute was as an artist and, being a  filmmaker, I wanted to make a film that  hadn't been made before—making a statement that a pohtician couldn't make but  that a filmmaker or an artist could make.  The way culture reflects poUtics and the  way culture reflects change—the possibiUties interest me intensely.  I was always foUowing the cultural scene  in South Africa. From the early 80s in  South Africa, this whole culture of resistance started to gain more and more momentum and community arts projects and  those sorts of things were set up. I was  [watching this from Canada] and started to  foUow certain individuals.  What you tend to get on the media [in  Canada] is always so incident- and conflict-  oriented, rather than issue-oriented. The  thing that impressed me and moved me  deeply about people in South Africa was  that, in spite of the horrible system people have to Uve under, they are so resUient.  People are able to rise above and make the  best of the situation and keep on going.  They aren't totaUy crushed down, and that  amazed me. How would I be Uke in that situation? Would I give up? Would I have the  strength to continue Uke that?  ResUience is expressed in culture, in music, in dance, in singing, in freedom songs,  and church songs and also in the way those  songs are so often about celebrating peoples' strengths—that was the kind of thing  I wanted to do, to focus on the strength of  people rather than on what we are getting  constantly in the media.  So that [inspired me] and so did the love  of the place. The love of the people, the  love of the culture and wanting to share  that. I think that at this stage, we aU know  apartheid is a terrible thing. We should  never forget that. At the same time we need  to know the people have been able to continue their Uves and find meaning in their  Uves; they try and move themselves and  their communities forward. That's what reaUy impressed me. These are my reasons.  Zaniub: You have chosen two very  powerful people for your film. How did  you go about doing this?  Marianne: I had read about Gcina  Mhlophe. My mother used to send me  women's magazines from South Africa.  There is a magazine caUed Fair Lady-  it's Uke Chatelaine—which had an article  about Gcina. I would always cut out articles about arts and I was really blown away  by this person. I thought this was someone I  would really Uke to meet. I filed it and kept  it for years and years.  As the idea for the film started to percolate, I had made a Ust of people I wanted  to see and she was one of them.

Filmmaker Marianne Kaplan  ft  ing a real overview of resistance culture. I  spoke to visuals artists, musicians, people  in theatre—anyone—right across the spectrum. I arrived in Johannesburg and that  same day there was a protest of censorship  in South Africa—censorship of films and  books that were banned or cut. To protest  this, weU-known South African writers were  reading pubUcly from the works of banned  writers. Gcina read a South African writer  and someone from the audience shouted at  her: "Do the wedding dancer," and she did  this poem caUed the "Wedding Dancer."  I couldn't beUeve it—I was so stunned.

AU of a sudden the government Ufted the  ban on pubUc marches, so for the first time  ever there were huge, legal protest marches  in every major city. I couldn't beUeve it. It  was such a thriU to be in a crowd of 80,000  people dancing down the streets of Johannesburg. You can't imagine what it was Uke.  Then the ANC [African National Congress] decided to un-ban itself. There was  a defiance campaign where masses of Black  people, so-caUed coloured people and white  people would just go and converge on a  white beach and go have a picnic. Masses of  VttKt 1K  VStfrfiEtoi**^  around with a bunch of mangoes to her  house and we sat for two hours. She gave me  an incredible interview that just confirmed  aU my fantasies about her. I asked her to do  something of her work and she got up and  she did the "Wedding Dancer" in the garden at her house with such intensity.  I came back to Canada. The image of her  I had on my video camera is so powerful—  it's reaUy what kept me going with this  project. At a certain point I realized that  I had to focus down more, but Gcina was  always going to be one of the key people  in the film because of what she represented  and because of her vision for the future.  Zaniub: I can see why Gcina was  so important. How about Mzwakhe  Mbuli—why did you choose him for the  film?  Marianne: Whilst we were fundraising  in Canada, I was foUowing South Africa  very closely, especiaUy culture. I get a progressive paper from South Africa every week  and I cut out everything on culture and file  it under dance, music—you know, the whole  thing. Mzwakhe interested me.  When I was in South Africa for the research I wanted to meet him but he was in  prison. He was supposed to be going on tour  with BUly Bragg. The government, to prevent him from touring, imprisoned him for,  Uke, the seventh time. I had no way to get  in touch with him. I tried to get in touch  with his wife and it became very clear that  this was not a good thing to try to do. So I  left it but I kept on foUowing him. He was  always in the back of my mind because he  is a very powerful force in the country.  I went to South Africa two months ahead  of shooting schedule because I wanted to  finish the research. The week I arrived,  Mzwakhe's house was bombed but I got  in touch with him and he agreed to [participate]. There were other people I was  planning to use in the film, but things  had changed and at a certain point it became clear that a very interesting film could  be made counter-pointing Gcina against  Mzwakhe. At a certain point I was going  to make it solely on Gcina but it was not  a good time for her. She was not in an up  space to make a movie and it became clear  it would be better to have these two very  different people.  Black people would turn up at a white hospital. This was aU going on. There was an  election where lots of people were kUled in  the coloured townships in Capetown. Killed  by poUce. They released seven veteran ANC  leaders and there was a huge raUy to welcome them.  We [the film crew] were there the night  they were released. Eighty thousand people show up to the ratty, and Gcina and  Mzwakhe are invited to perform. It was a  real exciting time and suddenly all was possible and everything we have dreamed of  was happening. The process was happening.  So of course the film had to change.  Zaniub: Songololo is going to tour.  How are you going to reach the widest  audience? There is the Canadian audience and what about the South African  audience?  Marianne: There are two distributors  in Canada. Canadian Filmmakers Distribution West is based in Vancouver and  they are going to handle distribution in EngUsh Canada. In Quebec we have Cinema  Libre and they will distribute in French  Canada. This is non-theatrical distribution.  Songololo is ideal for schools; we are going  to package it in two half hours so it can be  used in schools.  In South Africa it has been shown in  Cape Town and Johannesburg—there is a  print there. I have always wanted the film  to be used in South Africa because it can  be a real discussion, educational and debating point. FAWO [FUm and AUied Workers  Organization] has a distribution wing but  they are not organized for this so I want to  make a whole bunch of videotapes and send  them out to aU the community arts projects,  community centres and organizations. People do use film Uke that in South Africa. I  also want to get it into the school system.  Zaniub: What other work are you  thinking about making?  Marianne: The history of the Communist Party in South Africa is really interesting. A lot of Jews who came to South  Africa from Eastern Europe were in the vanguard of the Communist Party. These people are interesting, eccentric characters and  it would be great to get them talking about  their experiences. But who would fund this  film?

Contributors (mainly from Ontario and  the Maritimes) write on a diversity of subjects: lobbying for sexual orientation legislation (Becki Ross); lesbians and disability (Joanne Doucette); Afro-Caribbean lesbians (Makeda SUvera); organizing for a  university lesbian studies course (Carolyn  Gammon et al)—among others.  My favourites are "Lesbian/mother" by  Dian Day; "Lesbians and Aging: Triple  Trouble or Tremendous ThriU," by Jeanette  Auger; and "The Mind-Drifting Islands,"  by Michiline Grimard-Leduc. AU speak to  deeply felt concerns: the extraordinary pressure of raising homophobic teenagers within  the women's community; fears of exposure  and aUenation in old age; the deUcate balancing of refusing and admitting: as I resist  and withdraw from the dominant culture, I  must re-learn the process of admitting, recreating identity through community.

As Grimard-Leduc writes:  The system reUes on our schizophrenic  (sic)  'abUities'  to ensure an isolation  that it does not even have to enforce  since it comes from ourselves: the detachment from ourselves and from others.  Of course, as long as my dream-island is  known only to myself, I actuaUy Uve on  a prison-island, in sheer isolation.  Editor  Sharon  Dale  Stone  would  be  pleased with this passage,  I think.  She  states: "The focus of this anthology is on  the experiential...Readers looking for unrelenting analysis and theory wUl by and large  be disappointed."  Was I disappointed, overaU? Yes. Was I  disappointed because I was looking for unrelenting theory and analysis? No. I was disappointed because Lesbians in Canada is  neither one thing nor the other. It is not  simply a gathering of voices, nor is it clearly  an attempt to articulate our differences and  mirror our commonaUties as lesbians who  Uve in Canada. Throughout I wanted to ask  Stone: What impact do you think Canadi-  anism (regional and national) has on our experiences as lesbians? It is, I think, a fair  question.  Lesbians in Canada is a lesbian feminist text, written primarily by scholars,  tackling heterosexism, lesbophobia (the fear  and hatred of lesbians), and to a lesser extent racism, classism and regionalism. Yet  other than mentioning and defining the  terms just Usted, Stone refuses to pursue  the construction of Canadian lesbian feminist theory.  Why? The answer is to be found within  the sociopoUtical context of feminism.  There are deep divisions within the feminist  movement as to the functions of, and worth  of, activism and inteUectuaUsm. Stone intentionally identifies herself as an activist  and downplays her identity and role as an  • m Jk    ft  U  AUtll  2250 Commercial Dr.  Vancouver, B.C.

As an adjunct to this, Stone insists on  accessibUity, opposing inteUectual eUtism  within the feminist movement. "Theory,"  this book seems to argue, is simply one byproduct of dady Uving—we direct it, it does  not direct us.  Nevertheless, Lesbians in Canada does  have a weU-defined theoretical standpoint.  Stone is both a lesbian feminist activist and  these contributors? And how Ukely is it that  non-poUtical, non-scholarly lesbians would  read a book containing sociological, historical and phUosophical papers on heterosex-  iiim, lesbophobia, racism, classism and regionalism? In Lesbians in Canada, theory and analysis are imposed on the unprepared, and are refused to those who are  poUticaUy and intellectuaUy sophisticated.  The text thereby runs the risk of^empowering those whom it hopes to empower.

With MadeUne's death Jane's strategy  proves unworkable, impossible to sustain.  Despite her longing for total retreat, she allows Norman to enter her world, to ignite a  spark of desire. But he is a part of the outside world from which Jane has sought sanctuary. Once he enters, the world follows and  her sanctuary is forever changed.  But we are given two endings to this  fairy tale, one tragic— created by Jane, one  "happUy ever after" created by Norman,  where he plays prince to her Snow White.  Though Rozema presents a brooding,  somber story, she does so with Ught-  heaxted whimsy and humour. As a parody of fairy tale, the film offers deUghtful  touches—Norman's parents in their gingerbread house, Norman sleeping in the back  seat of his car in freshly pressed pajamas,  Zelda's wacky self-interested generosity,  Norman's orgasmic writing experience—  sprinkled with animated letters dancing off  the page and fireworks going off inside his  pupils.  Meaningful visual symbols fly by with  cavaUer playfulness— Norman fading backwards into a vat of white Uquid, a teacup  spiUing over with blood, Norman flageUat-  ing himself with red roses, and of course,  the white room itself.  The soundtrack is lusciously sensual, the  pop singer's music hauntingly aUuring—  originaUy composed by Rozema and Mark  Korven, and borrowing lyrics from EmUy  Dickinson. Visually the film is Ml of surprises and exquisite camera shots.  Even if its plot fads to seriously challenge bleak myths about women artists, the  White Room offers a playful journey into  visual and aural dehght.  November 90 Arts  ,^2*s#^#2^%sm^  Liberalism & sex  Against women's interests  by Bonnie Waterstone  THE SEXUAL LIBERALS AND  THE ATTACK ON FEMINISM  edited by Dorchen Leidholdt &  Janice G. Raymond  New York: Pergamon Press, 1988  Just reading the table of contents of this  book excited me. The Ust of contributors  reads Uke a roU call of radical feminists,  most of whom have written books that are  classics of feminist analysis. The Sexual  Liberals and the Attack on Feminism  is a coUection of essays which began as  speeches or panel presentations for a conference of the same name held AprU 6, 1987  at New York University Law School.  Conflict between sexual Uberals and feminists is nothing new. In the 60s feminists  confronted and challenged the sexual attitudes of hberal and left-wing men. In the  70s femimsts organized against rape, battery, sexual harassment and chUd sexual  abuse, and protested beauty pageants and  sexist ads. SexuaUy Uberal men reacted with  disdain and hostUity.  The backlash became more vociferous  when feminists began actively organizing  against pornography in the late 70s. At this  point, pornographers and civU Ubertarians  joined forces, calUng the feminists repressive  and censorious.  Not aU civU Ubertarians defended pornography, but their phUosophy is conducive to  that stance. CivU Ubertarians beUeve that  the state is the principal or sometimes the  sole threat to "human freedom" (an individual freedom, distinct from social or poUtical  equahty).  The onslaught of the civU Ubertarians  and the pornographers divided the women's  movement. Some Uberal feminists, who had  benefited from an aUiance with sexuaUy Uberal men on the issue of abortion, and some  socialist femimsts, who historicaUy have remained distant from feminist campaigns  against prostitution, rape, sexual abuse,  and pornography, did not support the radical feminists' fight against sexual exploitation. A small group of women in the US  went as far as to coUaborate with the anti-  feminists, forming F.A.C.T. (Feminist Anti-  Censorship Task Force).  mined. Liberalism, she says, robs women of  the critical feminist perspective they need.  Liberalism reduces "concrete positions of  power and powerlessness to mere relative  value judgments"—women's experience of  abuse becomes a "point of view."  SheUa Jeffreys provides an historical perspective by drawing parallels between the  backlash against feminists in the early part  of the 20th century and today. The so-called  sexual revolutions of the 20s and 60s, says  Jeffreys, were actuaUy attacks on feminism.  Her essay briefly traces how sexologists  and sex reformers undermined the efforts  of early feminists. These ideas Jeffreys develops in her books, The Spinster and  Her Enemies: Feminism and Sexuality 1880-1930, and Anticlimax. I've read  both of these and discovered a hidden history of feminists. When one reads the radical statements women of those generations  made, it is no wonder we don't know of  them. (EUsabeth Wolstenholme Elmy is not  a household name Uke Sigmund Freud.)  These feminists were not taken seriously.  The sexologists and sex reformers (Havelock  Elhs, Freud, etc.) attacked them as "antisex  prudes who were acting against the interests  of women," says Jeffreys. Today, sexual Uberals, whose roots Ue with the sexologists,  attack feminists in the same manner.  Havelock EUis, the most influential sexologist of the 19th century, argued that men  and women were entirely different biologically and therefore psychologicaUy. Female  sexuaUty was passive and masochistic. To  Elhs, it was obvious that women enjoyed being beaten up by pimps or husbands: you  could teU from the expression on a woman's  face during orgasm that it was pain she was  feeUng. Ellis went on to argue that because  of women's deUght in pain and aggression,  sexual abuse could not be taken seriously.  Why was ElUs seen as progressive at aU?  Because he advocated foreplay "to prepare  the woman" and for women's right to pleasure in sex.  Jeffreys examines the concept of sexual  pleasure, noting that: "we do not have a  word in our language which would aUow us  to talk about sexual responsc.that is not  positive." The assumption that any sexual  feeUng is pleasurable does not aUow women  ...women's experience of abuse  becomes a "point of view"  The Sexual Liberals is divided into six  parts. Part I opens with Andrea Dworkin,  Catherine MacKinnon and Sheila Jeffreys  clarifying the terms of the discussion.  Dworkin and MacKinnon are closely identified with the American fight against pornography through the human rights legislation  they tried, unsuccessfuUy, to establish in  Minnesota and Indiana. SheUa Jeffreys is a  British femimst historian who came up with  the name for the conference and the idea for  this book.  Sexual Uberalism is defined here as "a set  of poUtical beUefs and practices rooted in  the assumption that sexual expression is inherently Uberating and must be permitted  to flourish unchecked, even when it entails  the exploitation or brutahty of others."  MacKinnon begins her essay: "Once  there was a women's movement..." that  took women's side in everything, that criticized the ways women were sociaUy deter-  and girls to describe sexual arousal in a negative way—even when it is forced, when it  humUiates, degrades or betrays us. Jeffreys  suggests we need a word to describe sexual  feeUng that is "not in our best interests."  With this in mind, the 100 years of sexology and sex reform aimed at ensuring  women take pleasure in sexual intercourse  needs to be examined carefully and critically.  When Something Hurts Women...  Andrea Dworkin's essay, "Woman-Hating  Right and Left," dehneates in her incisive  style how both the right and the left want  to control women's sexuality. The first require chastity, the second orgasmic pleasure  in intercourse, but both right wing and left  wing men want women available to them  and for them. Dworkin caUs for a return  to a feminist movement that is very simple: "When something hurts women, feminists are against it."  One of the highUghts of Part II, FamUy Structures: The Patriarch and the Pimp,  was Louise Armstrong's analysis of what  happened to the feminist organizing against  chUdhood sexual assault. Armstrong, who  wrote Kiss Daddy Goodnight, recaUs how  we first spoke out about incest ten years  ago. Since then, things have become worse  for chUd victims and the mothers who try to  protect them. When people say to her: "But  at least we're talking about it now," Armstrong repUes: "Yes. But it was not our intention merely to start a long conversation."  Armstrong tells a chilling story of how  mothers and chUdren who turn to the state  name our victimization.) Using the rhetoric  of a woman's right to control our bodies.  Raymond sees surrogacy as the "right" to  give up control of our bodies.  Part IV on SexuaUty contains five essays  that discuss eroticization of women's subordination and suggest ways to resist, to be  pohticaUy active against this subordination.  I was particularly interested in SheUa  Jeffreys' analysis of lesbian sadomasochism  and butch-femme role playing. I agree with  her that it is necessary for lesbians to confront role playing and, obviously, to reject  Contributor Andrea Dworkin  for protection are betrayed. She draws a  portrait of the "incest mother," created  by the professionals who treat chUdhood  sexual abuse—the mother who is blamed  for "allowing" her male partner to sexually abuse her chUdren. This dreadful, collusive woman is the foundation of the disease model of incest, which protects paternal chUd molesters. Armstrong's essay is a  caU for change. Discussion and a flourishing problem-management industry are not  enough.  Another highUght for me was the essay  by Ann Jones who focuses on the famUy  (as she did in Women Who Kill) and  on women who fight back against abuse,  marital rape and battering to the point of  homicide. Jones dissects the family mythology that serves to keep women as prisoners  within a patriarchal structure.  She refers to Susan BrownmUler, who  showed that rapists serve att men by enforcing male supremacy. Batterers do on  the homefront what rapists do in the street.  Jones urges us to fight "not just against domestic violence but against that domesticity which couldn't carry on without it."  Part III, The New Reproductive Liberalism, features articles by Gena Corea, PhylUs Chesler and Janice Raymond, an activist  in the feminist resistance to new reproductive technologies (NRT). Gena Corea analyzes NRTs as a form of violence against  women. PhylUs Chesler discusses surrogacy  and its exploitation of women.  Janice Raymond in "Sexual and Reproductive Liberalism" examines the shift  within feminism away from beheving that  "women's choices were constructed, burdened, framed, impaired, constrained, Um-  ited, coerced, shaped by patriarchy." Now  a different view of feminism has emerged  which require that we "watch our language  of women as victims." (i.e. never discuss or  sadomasochism in order to create a sexuality that does not merely repeat heterosexual  and patriarchal dominance and submission.  Sex as we know it is socially constructed and  within this construct, inequaUty is sexy. H  we do not want to uphold male supremacy  and misogyny then we must chaUenge our  conditioning.  In "Toward a Feminist Praxis of Sexuality," Wendy Stock suggests ways women can  develop an alternative to patriarchal sex:  "We must sustain a vision of what the erotic  can be," nurturing our sexuaUty with a critical femimst awareness.  Part V, The Male Backlash, looks at  the reaction to feminist organizing against  pornography and violence against women  from the right, from the left and from the  gay Uberationists. Included in this section is  an essay by Florence Rush (The Best Kept  Secret, about incest) and a Canadian perspective from Susan Cole.  This comprehensive coUection closes with  Part VI, PoUtics and PossibiUties, which  contains two essays, one by Mary Daly,  "Be-Witching—Re-CaUing the Archimagi-  cal Powers of Women," and one by Janice Raymond, "Not a Sentimental Journey:  Women's Friendships." Daly spins a web of  words to create a vision for the future—  the possibiUties. Raymond, who wrote A  Passion for Friends, speaks of a female  friendship that is poUtical: "Radical feminism befriends women because it empowers  women to act on behalf of themselves and  each other."  The anger, clarity and commitment of  the women who have contributed to this  book shines through their writing. Despite  attacks from sexual Uberals, and the undermining of their efforts, these femimsts continue to speak out, to refine their critical  feminist awareness, and to work for women.  Their vision of feminism is inspiring.
