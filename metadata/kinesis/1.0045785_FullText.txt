A1C 5N5  , KINESIS NEWS  Doctors:  An epidemic of abuse  by Heidi Walsh  A Vancouver woman who was sexually  abused by her psychiatrist never even considered complaining to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC (CPSBC) when  she finally decided to take action against her  abuser.  Unfortunately, the CPSBC's recent attempts to investigate sexual abuse by doctors may do Uttle to convince women hke  Andrea Hynds (not her real name) that  their priority is to protect the public.  Already, women's groups and feminist  doctors are charging that the CPSBC's efforts may be insensitive, inadequate and—  worst of ah—hkely to preserve the public silence around sexual abuse by physicians.  The doctors' longstanding tradition of  "disciplining" themselves—a privilege they  share with other professional elites—has  produced a situation where sexually abused  women have been rendered invisible. "Going to the college was never an option  for me," said Hynds. "I know women who  have made complaints there who have not  been taken seriously. And frankly, when you  have been abused by a physician, often the  last people you want to deal with are another bunch of male doctors." Hynds went  through the criminal court system and won  her case.  The CPSBC is clearly beginning to  squirm at its reputation for putting the  interests of doctors ahead of those of  patients—and it's not squirming alone. This  May, the Ontario College of Physicians and  Surgeons released a detailed report—the result of a public inquiry —stating that up  to 10 percent of doctors abuse their patients. Shortly after, the CPSBC announced  a study of its own.  Coincidentally or not, the announcement  was made on the eve of the trial of Dr.  James Tyhurst, a Vancouver psychiatrist  and university professor who has since been  convicted of sexually assaulting four female  patients. (In 1981, a woman had reported  Tyhurst to the college for sexual abuse,  but the college's investigation dismissed her  charges.)  "Women are going to court to get doctors convicted and the college is getting  egg on its face for not doing its job,"  says Regina Lorek of Vancouver Rape ReUef, who says that women at rape crisis  centres and women's health groups have  talked among themselves for years about  the abuses—and the doctors are being com-  peUed to act.  The nine-member committee appointed  to investigate sexual abuse among BC  physicians has drawn criticism from ob-  NAC's historic meeting  by Jennifer Johnstone  and Debra J. Lewis  More than 300 representatives of women's  groups from across the country gathered in  Ottawa June 14-16 for what turned into an  historic Annual General Meeting of the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC).  Delegates approved pohcies ranging from  support for self -determination for Aboriginal peoples and Qu/'ebec, to calls for a prohibition on sex selection cUnics and a moratorium on in vitro fertiUzation faculties.  As weU, the vocal representation of lesbians  and women of colour at the conference resulted in an unprecedented recognition of issues affecting both groups.  In keeping with the theme of Solidarity  and Diversity, delegates endorsed a report  that promises to strengthen regional involvement, ensure representation from traditionally under-represented groups, and  build NAC's abihty to organize campaigns  across the country.  The passage of the Report on Organizational Change was particularly encouraging for many BC delegates who have been  involved in pressuring NAC to become a  more grassroots-based organization. At last  year's AGM, recommendations from the BC  Working Group on Organizational Change  were short-circuited when an Ontario delegate called quorum late Sunday afternoon.  As a result of the discord resulting from  the 1990 AGM, two members of the BC  Working Group, Marcy Cohen and Debra  Lewis, were added to executive discussions  this year. The resulting report, including  many of the principles recommended by the  Working Group, received strong endorsement at this year's AGM.  Key recommendations endorsed by delegates include:  • a greater proportion of resources to be  directed to developing NAC's presence in  the regions and implementing campaigns  across the country;  • affirmative action within NAC to ensure  representation from women of colour,  Aboriginal women and women with disabiUties;  • the development of a priority setting  framework to ensure that NAC work is  focused and effective, and  • in alternate years, holding the NAC annual meeting in a different region of the  country to improve regional accessibihty  and exposure.  A constitutional amendment requiring  affirmative action principles to be applied  in elections for the executive was a particularly important move for NAC. Specifically,  one vice president and four member-at-large  positions must now be filled by women of  colour, immigrant women of colour, Aboriginal women and women with disabihties.  Although this amendment did not officially  affect this year's election, delegates showed  their commitment to affirmative action by  electing three women from the designated  groups to fill the available member-at-large  positions: Judi Johnny, from the Yukon, a  member of the DisAbled Women's Network  of Canada; Sunera Thobani, from B.C., a  member of the South Asian Women's Group  and the Vancouver Status of Women; and  Fely ViUasin of the Toronto Organization  for Domestic Workers' Rights.  BC wul be weU-represented on this year's  NAC executive. In addition to Sunera  Thobani, Marianne Alto (Victoria Status  of Women Action Group) was elected as  vice-president, Shelagh Day of Vancouver was acclaimed as secretary, and treasurer Anne Rowan wiU be moving from  Toronto to Vancouver this faU. They wUl  join South/Central BC Regional Representative Donna Cameron (Penticton Women's  Centre) who was elected in 1990 for a two-  year term.  The organizational change process will  continue through the 1991- 2 term, as regions discuss how best to build structures  to serve their needs. A group was struck at  the AGM to continue the work of organizational change in the South/Central BC Region.  In addition to the Organizational Change  Report, delegates endorsed three NAC priority campaigns for the coming year. The  "52 Percent Solution" will seek to mobiUze  the women's movement in the development  of a caring alternative to the Tory agenda.  "United Against Male Violence" and "Taking Care of Canada: the Future of Women's  Work" complete NAC's priority campaigns  agenda.  The bad news is that implementation of  some recommendations wUl be delayed because of NAC's tight financial situation. For  example, a proposal that NAC begin hiring  organizers to assist member groups in regional development and implementation of  campaigns is on hold until resources over  and above the current budget can be found.  Like all women's groups funded by Secretary of State Women's Programs, NAC is  stiU waiting for confirmation of this year's  grant. Despite a surprise visit from the Secretary of State, Robert DeCotre, at the Friday conference (at which delegates treated  him to a wiener roast and a rousing chorus  of "where's our money"), there has been no  official word on funding for member groups  (including the Vancouver Status of Women)  or NAC from the federal government.  For the third year running, senior members of the Tory government refused to  attend the annual women's lobby which  wrapped up the NAC conference. This year,  foUowing meetings with both the Liberals  and NDP, delegates set out in search of Tory  members to get some "public answers to  public questions." The women first stormed  a closed meeting of the gun control committee, demanding tighter regulations. When  they proceeded to the House of Commons,  which was also sitting, the doors to parliament were slammed in their faces.  The closing scene from this year's NAC  meetings showed a smaU but diverse group  of women defiantly singing on the steps under the Peace Tower, whUe ranged behind  them the Royal Canadian Mounted Pohced  barred the entrance to parliament.  servers who say the inquiry wUl be Uttle  more than a closed-shop affair.  The criticism focuses on three areas:  • the composition of the committee;  • the way in which information wUl be  gathered, and  • confusion as to whether or not the committee's findings will be publicly released.  UnUke  the  Ontario committee,  which  was chaired by a femimst lawyer and included other non-medical participants, the  BC committee is headed by the presidentelect of the college, Dr. Patricia Rebbeck—  and aU but one of its members are physicians.  Committee member and psychiatrist Dr.  Kate Parfitt will resign from the inquiry  unless the committee is restructured and  opened up to the community. "The committee should have at least an equal ratio of  non-medical members to those within the  profession," says Parfitt, "and it should be  chaired by a non-medical person, too."  Parfitt is concerned that the CPSBC will  be seen as pohcing itself, adding that other  committee members share her view.  Women's groups have also asked the committee to diversify its membership, not because the panehsts lack competency—the  majority are working in the area of sexual abuse—but because their experience as  physicians is by definition too narrow. Rape  crisis workers, abuse survivors and private  therapists recently met with the committee  to ask for community representation on the  committee.  ...observers say the  inquiry will be little  more than a closed-  shop affair.  Johanna Pilot of Vancouver's WAVAW  Rape Crisis Centre attended the meeting.  "There should be women survivors [on the  committee] who have the experience, and  women from women's groups who have  worked on their behalf," says Pilot. "The  committee needs to get the full information  and understanding of the issues and dynamics [of abuse] to comprehend what needs to  be done."  Rebbeck has said she will present these  concerns to the executive committee of the  college on June 24th.  A Hotline and What Else?  So far, the committee's only attempt to investigate the extent of abuse has been to set  up a telephone hot-line. Women who call the  number Usten to a recorded message asking  them to leave a name and number so that  "a representative of the committee can call  you back."  Andrea Hynds observes, "Survivors [of  abuse] are untrusting of others, so it is crucial for them to keep their privacy and to  speak where they feel safe. It's very frightening to just give your name and number to  a stranger."  Ann Johns of Equal Justice for Women—  See DOCTORS page 8  KINESIS July :SSSSSS**SS*S**^^  NEWS  MediaWatch botches its move  by Karen Duthie  A uiulateral decision by the national  committee of MediaWatch to move its  head office from Vancouver to Toronto has  left Vancouver members and volunteers incensed at the lack of consultation.  It is the poUtics more than the move itself that is upsetting," says Vancouver member Agnes Huang. MediaWatch members  were not consulted about the move and only  learned of it in a letter from Executive Director Suzanne Strutt regarding an information meeting in early June.  Member Barbara McLeUan says while  there is some understanding of the need to  move, many members fail to see why the  decision was made umlaterally. "I feel misled," says McLellan. "I was given to under  stand that the general membership had voting power for such important decisions."  MediaWatch is a national feminist organization which works to improve the portrayal and status of women in the media  through public education and by lobbying  for change in the broadcast and advertising  industries.  Like most feminist groups, MediaWatch  rehes heavily on volunteer members across  the country. There are 30-40 active members in the Vancouver area alone. Head  office provides employment for four staff  members.  Former Communications Officer Jennifer  Elhs is concerned with how the staff and volunteers have been treated in Ught of the decision. The secretary was laid off with one  month's notice, and the volunteer coordina  tor was offered the same job in Toronto—  but without money to cover moving expenses.  Many head office projects have been  abandoned, with many volunteer hours subsequently wasted. For instance, volunteers  have been in touch with more than 150 community organizations to arrange workshops  regarding sexism in the media. Because the  future of the Vancouver branch of MediaWatch is unknown, this project has become obsolete.  Suzanne Strutt would not comment on  the controversial decision to move, and MediaWatch president Francine Senecal did  not return Kinesis' phone calls.  The 13-member national committee—  consisting of regional representatives and  the elected board of directors—explained  their decision in a letter to the membership  in mid-June.  Their four reasons were:  • the need to be close to poUtical and industry decision-makers, including advertisers;  • proximity to Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission hearings to be held in Toronto in the  next few months;  • budget restraints which would Umit the  number of committee members who  could be sent to meetings in Vancouver;  • the failure to find a suitable replacement  for Strutt, who wiU be leaving the orga-  Affirmative action for NDP  by Cathy Griffin  The federal New Democratic Party decided at their national convention in June  to become the first major poUtical party in  North America to ensure that women hold  at least 50 percent of the party's nominations for seats in the House of Commons.  The "Resolution on Gender Equity" was  supported by more than two-thirds of the  party and read, in part... "The Council of  the Federal Party shall have the authority  to establish rules for nomination to achieve  affirmative action goals."  The new rules would require the NDP  to actively recruit more women candidates,  but does not mean men would be excluded  from fielding their candidacy. If the incumbent was a male, or if no suitable female  candidate could be found, a man would be  considered for nomination.  In breaking with the past, the resolution  aUows the federal party to intervene in the  local nomination selection process, a move  which upset at least one NDP MP, Lyle  Kristiansen (Kootenay West-Revelstoke),  who described the new pohcy as undemocratic.  MP Dawn Black (New Westminster)  fought hard for the poUcy, as did leader Audrey McLaughlin. In an interview from Ottawa, Black said: "Our goal is to keep the  ridings open for women. We hope this process wUl encourage women to come forward  from the grassroots organizations and get  involved. Our policy is meant to encourage active recruitment. It is a temporary  measure to help target groups." Says Black,  without such a poUcy, women would have  to wait hundreds of years to achieve gender  parity within the party.  The House of Commons has 295 seats, 40  of which are held by women. The federal  NDP already has a pohcy of gender parity  in its party structure, with equal representation of women and men at the executive  level.  Margaret BirreU, president of the NDP  Council of Federal Ridings and an active supporter of the gender equity policy, describes it as "a very positive step for  women", yet admits there are stiU problems  to work out. The first hurdle is to negotiate and discuss the new nomination selection process with the riding associations, a  process that has traditionally been outside  the jurisdiction of the federal party.  According to BirreU, there has been "no  negative input from the riding associations  about the new resolution."  There is guarded optimism among women's organizations as to what the real impact and long-term effects of the affirmative  action pohcy wUl be.  Mobina Jaffer of the Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of BC says: "Certainly affirmative action is one way of helping women, but women should also be given  more financial assistance whUe they are getting involved in the nomination process."  Jaffer beUeves that not enough is being done  to reach women of colour at a grassroots  level and to include them in the pohtical  process. Jaffer also felt that change was  needed in more than just the numbers of  women participating at a federal level and  that there needed to be critical masses of  women participating at ah levels of government.  Lynne Brown, co-ordinator of the Port  Coquitlam Women's Centre beheves the  new poUcy is "an exceUent idea. It shows  the NDP are paying attention to the needs  of women." Brown added that the women's  centre receives a lot of support from their  local MPs—both of whom are NDP.  Raminder Dosanjh, an activist with the  Vancouver-based Indian MahUa Association, stated it was "about time an affirmative action pohcy was enacted recognizing  the lack of women in the poUtical process.  It's a positive step."  Dosanjh has concerns that the poUcy will  not reach out to women of colour on every  socioeconomic level. She beUeves that the  way to address these concerns is by educating grassroots women through the work of  local activists. "Activists in any organization make the biggest changes. I've been involved in various levels of poUtics since the  1970's and I haven't seen any attempt to  reach out to women of colour activists of  ethnic communities."  The New Democrats are optimistic they  wUl be able to write and implement their  gender equahty resolution in time for the  next federal election.  EVALUATION-MEDIAS  MEDIAWATCH  nization in July (the candidate must be  bUingual and have lobbying experience).  The committee beheves that it wUl have  a better chance of finding an executive  director in central Canada.  Vancouver members are not satisfied  with the reasons given to justify the move  and beheve further study is needed on the  question of where MediaWatch can be most  effective.  But their real anger is reserved for the national committee's process—or lack thereof.  In a letter dated June 10 and forwarded to  the committee, 10 Vancouver members describe how the decision to move "has caused  BC members to seriously question the structure and integrity of MediaWatch."  The members have called upon the national committee to rescind the decision to  move "untU a general meeting can be held  where aU members can debate and vote on  this critical matter."  We strongly recommend...  (From page 5:) These recommendations are just a sampling of the work of the ad hoc  group which formed at the law symposium. Representatives from nnmerous groups contributed to the recommendations including the organizations named on page five, and the  National Association of Women and the Law, Immigrant Women of Saskatchewan, LEAF,  the Advocacy Research Council for the Handicapped, among others.  • Racism and racial discrirnination exist as pervasive material realities in oar daily Uves.  The legal process denies and fails to recognize the existence of racism as a material reality. Therefore, we recommend: that the Criminal Code be amended to provide: a) that  acts of racism be deemed to be aggravating factors in the commission of any crime,  and, b) that a criminal act committed in response to an act of racism be deemed a mitr  igated factor.  • A significant gap of this symposium was the failure to develop and implement a labour  and employment law track within which issues could be addressed. These issues include:  a complete review of labour legislation as it affects working women specificaUy. Of particular concern are employment standards issues for women (such as increased minimum wage, comprehensive fully paid parental and family responsibiUty leaves); workplace health and safety issues affecting women (including pregnancy-related job modification or reassignment, adequate tracking of reproductive hazards in the workplace);  and harassment in the workplace (including but not Umited to: gender; race; disabihty;  aboriginal origin; sexual orientation).  ► When immigrant women who are on visas are battered, their marriage sponsorship can  be withdrawn if they protest. While landed immigrant status can be granted on compassionate grounds, this does not always happen. Research should be done which wiU reveal  the pattern of decision-making of immigration officers when battery or some other physical or psychological abuse is occurring to particularly vulnerable immigrant women.  ► There should be no [famUy disputes] mediation where family violence is involved. Women  are too vulnerable to be able to protect their own interests in such circumstances. Research should be undertaken regarding the criteria for mediation, its use currently, and  the results for women.  ► Funding for women's organizations dedicated to equahty for women should not be cut.  Transformation of the justice system cannot take place without interaction between government, justice officials and organizations knowledgeable in the field. H funding is cut,  there wiU be no organizations able to speak for women on these issues.  ► Governments must establish a framework for their own equahty rights htigation. At  the moment governments, with some exceptions, are simply defending any law or policy which is challenged. The result is that governments are on the wrong side, fighting  against women's equality interests, and in many cases spending miUions of doUars doing  so.  » Research should be undertaken regarding damage awards in personal injury cases.  Awards to injured housewives and girls reflect their social devaluation because of their  sex. Similar research should be undertaken regarding damage awards to women as compared to men which result from medical malpractice.  KINESIS News  ,^^^^###2%^^*^  Legal symposium on "gender bias"  But will the gov't respond?  by Agnes Huang  Despite being poorly represented and inadequately consulted, feminist and grassroots women's organizations used the occasion of a national symposium on woman and  the law to generate an impressive hst of recommendations addressing a range of legal,  pohtical and social concerns.  Whether government wUl respond to  their recommendations is, of course, another matter.  Federal Justice Minister Kim CampbeU  hosted the three-day National Symposium  on Women, Law and the Administration of  Justice in June. The symposium grew out ol  the federal-provincial-territorial Attorneys  General working group on "gender equality" in the Canadian justice system, estab-  Ushed last year.  The invitation-only affair brought delegates from across the country, the vast  majority of whom were judges, lawyers,  academics, bureaucrats and poUticians.  Women's and community organizations  were about 20 percent of the attendees at  the Vancouver symposium.  And many groups were noticeably missing. None of the delegates were from organizations representing women with mental  disabiUties, domestic workers, lesbians and  women on social assistance.  "There was no concerted effort to make  sure that the independent women's movement was here," said Lee Lakeman, BC  representative of the Canadian Association  of Sexual Assault Centres. "Women's centres are not represented, sexual assault centres are under-represented, and transition  houses are not formaUy represented."  A Department of Justice spokesperson  said that only national community organizations were invited. This excluded many  women's groups which do not have the resources to operate beyond the regional or  provincial level.  The symposium's official agenda addressed discrimination against women in  substantive law, in the legal process, and  Pauline Busch.  in the legal professions. Workshops provided forums for discussing violence against  women, custody and support issues, acces-  sibUity of the justice system, women in prisons, and judicial (judges') education.  Representatives from the women's organizations were quick to point out that  the symposium's concept of gender bias  was too narrow to address the concerns of  many women. Poverty and race were, for  the grassroots women's groups, inextricably  hnked to the sexism at the core of Canada's  justice system.  Pauline Busch of the Native Women's Association of Canada described gender bias in  the judicial system as a white, middle-class  pre-occupation. "We as Aboriginal women  are stiU struggling with basic survival issues," said Busch. "To us, to address gender bias would be a luxury."  Native women's caU for a separate Aboriginal justice system was rejected by  CampbeU. At a press conference she said,  "I don't Uke this idea that we have a justice  system in which everybody who doesn't fit  has to get some special system. My view is  that we should define the boundaries more  broadly." CampbeU added that talk about  a separate Aboriginal justice "is as much a  semantic problem as anything."  Shelagh Day, co-chair of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women's  Justice Committee (NAC) said, "Solving  the problems of aU women in Canada that  have to do with justice requires us to ad-  I"  ■r  ''>  w)  *}  "  + f  noted that some Black women do not trust  the justice system and wiU not turn in  their Black partners who batter them because these women know that their menfolk are also victimized by the justice system. "We have in this situation public violence and private violence interacting to victimize these women who are already doubly  victimized."  For people Uving in the north, the justice system is a foreign element. Judi  Johnny, Yukon representative of the DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN), said  that "the justice system is made in the  southern part of Canada by southerners and  administered by southern judges brought up  to the north to do their time."  The disadvantage for women with disabilities is compounded. Johnny said that even  physical access to courthouses and lawyers'  offices can be a challenge. She added that  women with disabihties who are abused are  often not viewed as credible witnesses despite overwhelming evidence of physical violence. "A woman with disabihties who gets  into the court system is a rare person indeed," said Johnny.  Insensitivity to women with disabiUties  was quite evident at the conference. Only  on the final day and after personaUy lodging complaints about their treatment were  women with disabihties aUotted reserved  seating at the front of the conference room.  Panehsts were often reminded to slow down  in order to be understandable to women  with hearing impairments.  Esmeralda Thornhill.  dress problems of racism, poverty, disabU-  ities, and discrimination because of sexual  orientation and ethnicity'."  In her plenary address, Jean Swanson,  vice-president of the National Anti-Poverty  Organizations, described how the government plays a role in criminalizing poor  women. Most women in prison are poor,  said Swanson who pointed to laws that ensure poverty: welfare laws, minimum wage  laws and tax laws.  Swanson said that many poor women fear  that welfare officials wiU find out that they  do some work under the table; they fear that -  the pohce wUl discover that the car they  drive to get to work is not considered safe.  "What we need", says Swanson, "is a society where women don't fear the legal system".  Several participants pubUcly pressed  CampbeU to acknowledge that racism is a  pervasive material reaUty in the daily hves  of people of colour which hinders their access to justice.  Esmeralda ThornhUl, president of the  Congress of Black Women of Canada, said  that the law offers no appropriate protection for Black women. "Right now, racism,  racial discrimination—the reality of the  Uves of people of colour— is erased because  it is not caught up in the filter of law."  Glenda Simms, president of the Canadian  Advisory CouncU on the Status of Women,  Taking the Initiative  A highlight of the conference was the move  by women's groups to form an ad hoc  1 Delegates  from  Organizations  Dedicated  • to Overcoming Women's Inequality group.  The women worked for five hours one night  to reach consensus on approximately 70 res-  ' olutions (see  box on page 4)- Many of  their recommendations were in areas which  lacked an official workshop, such as constitutional law, and employment and labour  law.  Eunadie Johnson, president of the National Organization of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women of Canada, spoke  of the solidarity a,mong equaUty-seeking  groups. "The biggest thing about this conference was that a lot of individual feminists and feminist organizations were able  to meet and come to some kind of understanding about each other's issues and put  forth a solid front in terms of our concerns."  The ad hoc group took a strong stand  against the current prison system for  women. Pauline Busch said that eight out  of ten women in prisons—many Aboriginal women—have a history of abuse, yet  their needs are rarely addressed within the  system. She argued for the closure of the  Prison for Women (P4W) in Kingston—  the only maximum security penitentiary for  women in Canada—because women incarcerated there are far removed from any support system they have. "JaUs do not have  a healing process in place. A sentence to  Kingston prison is the same as a death sentence."  The ad hoc group also stressed the  need for meaningful community participation when addressing issues of women's inequaUty. A process of genuine consultation  was notably absent from the pre-conference  planning meetings to set the agenda. Some  delegates were unaware of the meetings,  wldle others were angered that the recommendations they made during the consultation phase were not included on the agenda.  The justice minister was also chaUenged]  to take an active first step by thoroughly examining the federal government's practices  in its own equahty rights htigation.  Shelagh Day said that the government isl  wasting miUions of doUars to defend laws  Tiffany Mamakeesic.  and poUcies being chaUenged by women and  other disadvantaged groups under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. "We beheve  that the government should be helping us  to use the law," said Day, "not fighting us  when we chaUenge something that clearly  has to be changed in order to provide justice."  By the conference's end, CampbeU hat  agreed to conduct an audit on her department's position in htigation proceedings.  The ad hoc group also urged that funding  for women's organizations, support services  transition houses and feminist research be  high on the government's spending hst i:  genuine change was to be achieved.  Tiffany Mamakeesic, youth representative of the Native Women's Association o:  Canada, added that the government needs  to fund more legal educational programs to  make the law accessible. "Our people don't  understand the justice system; they don't  know about the human rights commissions.  Some places are just so isolated, no information reaUy gets to them."  The recommendations from the conference workshops are now in the hands of the  working group on gender equahty. For many  community-based women at the conference,  the baU now clearly hes in Kim CampbeU's  court—and they want action. "We wiU be  foUowing up and chaUenging the minister in  September," said Pauline Busch, in reference to an Aboriginal justice conference in  YeUowknife.  WhUe CampbeU has professed her commitment to eliminating gender bias from  the justice system, Lee Lakeman is not convinced that the minister wiU be able to  get resolutions past her Conservative colleagues. "There is a basic contradiction between a Conservative pohtic and a feminist  pohtic," said Lakeman, "and it is not entirely clear to me what Kim CampbeU is going to do with that."

KINESIS ^        ssssssssass^^  NEWS  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Chris Meyer  "Unsolved"  murders  of young  women on rise  The "unsolved" murders of women in  BC's lower mainland and Vancouver Island  continue to increase at a horrific rate. Es-  quimalt resident Melissa Nicholson, age 17,  was kiUed in early June on southern Vancouver Island. She is one of three teenage  women murdered since June 1990 whose  kiUers have gone undetected, according to  pohce.  Seventeen-year old Kimberley GaUup  was kiUed in a Victoria hotel last November, and 18-year old Cheri Lyn Smith was  murdered near Saanich in June, 1990.  Many of the over 25 victims who have  died since the early 1980s are young women  working as prostitutes—and many are Native. An officer working with the RCMP's  "special investigation" of the women's murders said the pohce do not beheve there is  a serial kiUer involved.  Prostitutes' rights activists in Vancouver  have blamed the federal anti-soliciting bUl  (C-49) passed in 1985, for encouraging the  conditions that make prostitutes vulnerable  to violent attacks. In particular, the bUl enables pohce to harass hookers, forcing them  to work in unsafe areas.  Services for  immigrant,  refugee  women lacking  Poor mental health services for immigrant and refugee women is the focus of a recent study conducted by the Multicultural  Women's Program at Doctors Hospital in  Toronto.  From a survey of 36 metro Toronto organizations that work with immigrant women,  the report revealed that women who have  been sexuaUy assaulted are particularly  lacking in appropriate services.  Other identified needs outhned in the report are assistance in the areas of immigrant women suffering from depression, victims of psychological and physical abuse by  male partners, and survivors of incest.  Judith PUowsky, the report's author,  came to Canada from ChUe 15 years ago  and has dealt personaUy with some of the  problems that lead women to seek mental  health services. "I've worked in every possible job, I've been a factory worker and a  maid in a hotel," PUowsky said. "We immigrant women, together with indigenous  women, are one of the lowest paid groups  in the workplace in Canada. We also suffer  from racism and discrimination, which affects our self-esteem, our identity and our  psychological weU-being. Our roles as mothers and wives change, and our role as women  also changes."  When immigrant women do seek mental  health services, the report says the three  most common barriers they face are language, a lack of personnel who are trained  to be sensitive to different cultures, and a  lack of free services and information.  War Against  Women upsets  Tory members  A report that caUs on the federal government to create a Royal Commission on violence against women and girls was not endorsed by the Conservative majority on a  parUamentary committee, in part because  of its title.  The War Against Women is the title  that was labeUed "inflammatory" by Tory  MP Stan WUbee of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare which voted 4-2  to merely table—and not endorse—the report. WUbee also complained the document  was "too femimst" in places.

KINESIS  New Democratic MP Dawn Black, a  member of the sub-committee and a strong  supporter of the report, said the subcommittee's rejection gives the report no  standing with the federal government. Black  said that the Tories are showing they don't  want to hsten to "ah of the women and  men who came to the sub-committee to  share with us some very painful Ufe experiences." Liberal MP Mary Clancy also voted  in favour of the report.  The prime minister, in a move to save  face, declared that his government did indeed endorse the report, despite the actions  of his coUeagues.  The War Against Women contains a  number of wide-reaching recommendations.  Parliament, it says, must repeal the "mistake of fact" defence in rape cases, which allows a man to say he honestly—but in fact  mistakenly—beheved a woman consented.  It also recommends a federal-provincial media hteracy program to teach high schools  students to "criticaUy assess media representations and messages including violence  against women."  The report offers a scathing view of how  extensive violence against women is in this  country.  Court setback  for women  in prisons  A recent ruhng from the Saskatchewan  Court of Appeal has been described as a  major setback for women, (particularly Native women) in Canada's prison system. .  The ruhng once again puts women who  are serving sentences at the Saskatchewan  Penitentiary at risk of being shipped to  Canada's only federal prison for women  (P4W) at Kingston, Ontario.  In the June, 1991 decision, the Court of  Appeal tossed out a lower court order that  had effectively banned transporting women  prisoners from Saskatchewan. The three-  member panel of the appeal court ruled that  only the Federal Court of Canada is autho  rized to issue such an order.  Last year, Madam Justice Marian Wedge  of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's  Bench had ruled that it was discriminatory, cruel and unusual punishment to send  women to the prison in Kingston which she  described as "medieval and castle-like," a  ruUng which effectively halted the transfer of women prisoners from Saskatchewan.  The judge's ruhng was consistent with what  prison and Native activists have said for  years about P4W.  Wedge found that such a move is a threat  to women's hves and deprives them of their  cultural and famUy ties. "To most Native  famiUes in the region [Saskatchewan] a trip  to Kingston without funding is as unattainable as a trip to the moon," she said. Wedge  acknowledged that women transferred to  Kingston ran "a high risk of death by suicide."  In the last year, three women committed  suicide at P4W.  The judge's decision of last July 15 was  specific to Carole Maureen Daniels, a Native  woman who is now considering a Supreme  Court appeal.

(ABE is a program in which people  who have not completed highschool can upgrade their educaiton.) Adult students usually have family and financial responsibihties that get in the way of coming to class.  ABE students are usually poor. They may  be on welfare, or in and out of seasonal or  temporary jobs which do not pay well. Often  their bad experiences in the regular school  system have left them with no confidence in  their abihty to do school work; they have  been taught to think of themselves as dumb  or lazy.  Their courage and determination in spite  of such obstacles is amazing.  Women ABE students, however, have  several additional strikes against them. The  best way to get an idea of the problems  women ABE students face is to hsten to the  stories women tell. Here are three of our students. Their names and some circumstances  have been changed.  Molly Clark is a Native woman who had  just turned 40 when she started class, which  she attended with her husband. He battered her; her father was also a batterer. She  had three school age children still hving at  home. She was often in trouble with her government sponsor because she was "sick" too  often. In fact, sometimes she was too badly  beaten to come, and sometimes her children  were sick. There was no provision for leave  for either of these reasons under the terms  of her sponsorship.  When Molly Clark came into the program she measured grade six in a standardized test; the test is biased in favour of white  middle class students. She spoke very quietly and hesitantly, usually looking to her  husband for permission, in apology or fear.  She enjoyed the movies from NFB on every subject, but especially those about First  Nations people and culture. She didn't often  take much part in the discussion of them,  but always wanted more.  There was a great deal of pressure on  Molly Clark to work quickly since she was  being funded for only seven months. After  achieving a shaky grade 10, she went on  to a short training course but couldn't find  much work. The intermittent work available  to her led her to supplement her income by  cleaning houses, which she had done all of  her hfe in her "spare time."  Molly Clark's needs were simply not met  by the ABE program. She needed day care;  a women-only class so she was not in the  same class as the man who was battering  her; a class that took into account her heritage and responsibihties as a First Nations  woman; counselhng and support around  battering; self-esteem building as part of  the classroom work; a funding source that  would allow her to work at a reasonable  pace, and that would not penalize her every time she was "sick." She needed vocational training that didn't require an academic grade 12 to enter it, so she could get  started more quickly.  Linda Clemont is a white woman in her  20s who paid a great deal of attention to  her clothes and make-up. She left home in  her early teens and had been making it on  her own since, usually hving with her current boyfriend. In class she read well for a  grade 10 student, but her writing was so  full of mistakes of structure and word form  that it was often difficult to tell what she  meant, so it was very hard to help her edit  it. When she spoke, the ends of most words  were left off, blurred or incorrect. She said  "ing" where she needed "ed" or "intelli  gent" when she meant "intelligence", difficulties that are common for second language  speakers, although her mother tongue is Enghsh.  Linda Clemont offered answers in class  or in private conversation in a rush with a  duck of the head. It seemed that since no  one had ever hstened to her answers or her  comments, in fact probably had never invited her to speak, she had never had much  need to find the words which correctly ex-  1 what she was trying to say.  She was constantly asking what the criteria are for "completing" and wanted to  know at all times if she was making satisfactory progress for "going on" next term to  was a good student, interested in continuing to secondary school. However, her family decided she should quit school so she  could help her mother at home; she had a  younger brother that the family was sending to school, and expenses were too great  to send a daughter to school also.  Soon after her marriage, Amarjit Kaur  came to Canada. The marriage was a disaster and she left him rather than submit to  his alcoholic rages. She went to hve with her  married sister, got a night-time cleaning job  and came to school in the day time. However, a serious accident left Amarjit Kaur  with severe pain. She was unable to continue the heavy work as a cleaner. Her doctors were unable to account for her pain, or  the next level. When we talked to her about  giving herself time to develop a strong base,  Linda Clemont said it was important that  she go on next term. She said she had to go  out and get a good job soon so she could  bring home a good salary to contribute to  the family income.  Her boyfriend was "a really nice guy" but  he didn't see why she had to come back to  school. (When she was working he didn't  see why she couldn't get better pay.) Linda  Clemont was absent often either because  her boyfriend was home sick and needed  someone to take care of him, or because her  sister-in-law, who drove her to school, had  something else to do and couldn't fit Linda  into her schedule. Toward the end of the  term, Linda Clemont got pregnant.  What does Linda Clemont need? She's  going to need day care. She needs transportation; decent funding so that there is  not so much pressure to finish quickly;  she needs opportunities at school for feminist consciousness-raising because she is not  ready for an all-woman's class, and there  would be too much opposition to it at home.  She needs a classroom style that works a lot  on speech and confidence building, not simply doing the required exercises that will let  her pass on to the next level.  Amarjit Kaur immigrated to Canada  from India a few years ago. She completed  her elementary school education there. She  relieve it; they told her that it was in her  mind, or that she was in pain because she  was depressed by her divorce.  Amarjit Kaur's needs are also not being met. She needs a full Enghsh-as-a-  Second-Language class which will allow her  to complete her high school work in Enghsh; she needs funding and transportation  so she can be more independent of her sister and brother-in-law. Amarjit Kaur needs  a women-only class where she can deal with  the disapproval of her community because  she is divorced, and with her own fears that  she will never find anyone willing to marry  her, or that she will never be able to have  children. She needs her school to address the  racism against South Asians so that she can  participate more actively in her classes.  Molly Clark, Amarjit Kaur and Linda  Clemont have some basic needs in common:  day care, transportation, funding and class  work that takes into account their backgrounds and particular strengths and weak-  How Women Are Stopped  The sexism in our society stops women in  other ways. One of the keys to success of  an ABE student is the support they get at  home for continuing their studies. Women  have a harder time getting that support because their education is not seen to be important, and because when they come back  to school things at home change. Other  family members' hves are disrupted when  the wife and mother is not at home as  much, and has other interests—homework  and exams—to fit into her schedule.  The men in their hves often do not support them in going back to school, although  they may seem supportive at first. The men  may require them to be at home to take care  of them and the children or they are threatened by the growing confidence and independence of the women. "I think you should  go to school sweetie. Yes, get an education.  Maybe then you won't be a dummy all your  hfe." "Sure go to classes but I don't want to  hear of the kids arriving home to an empty  house, do you hear?" Or "Hey I'm on night  shift this week. What am I going to do all  day without you, if you go off to class?"  The school itself is another reflection of  much of the sexism in the rest of the world.  The men in the room talk more and talk  more confidently. If the men think an article or task is stupid the teacher may well  drop it.  Women instructors, including feminists,  are often reluctant to pay special attention  to women's needs. There may be a bac c-  lash if the men in the class perceive her as  a feminist; she may or may not get suj>-  port from her administration about complaints of anti-male behaviour. (Behaviour  that treats men and women equally is often perceived as woman-positive, and hence  anti-male.) She may or may not be subject  to violence at home which eats at her self-  confidence.  For example, if a story about a woman  getting her first period embarrasses the  male students, it probably won't get read.  Instead we read stories about men's introduction to sex. We can find stories of men's  hves which show them out in the world  learning a trade, being a hero, overcoming  great odds. We find stories of women who  have overcome battering. And thank god  those now exist! But you can't use these it  a mixed class; it is too scary for the women.  Some of the men there are sure to be batterers and might get tense or blow up.  It's cutback time again at the colleges  in British Columbia. This comes every few  years. A lot of the temporary staff lose their  jobs or are cutback to four or six hours a  week. There's no money for books or photocopying. Counsellors are laid off and the  library goes on reduced hours. Frills hke  hfe skills, study skills, and special help chnics disappear. The Indian bands and MSSH  (Ministry of Social Services and Housing)  tell the potential students that there will  be stricter rules around attendance because  the wait hsts are so long. Students who can t  attend 90 percent of the time will have o  leave the programs and wait until they arc  "really" ready. Teachers lose any curriculum,  development time and office hours.  What happens is that we go back to a  program that is the lowest common denominator. It takes the least imagination on the  part of the teachers because they are so exhausted and overloaded they can't handle  anything else. This means we go back to £  program which barely serves the "best" students. The best students are the ones who  are healthy, who have a supportive family,  day care arrangements and whose money  needs are not too pressing. Students who do  not fit this description are said to be "not  really committed on the part of the student."  Feminists will recognize this reasoning.  It's called blame the victim.  Evelyn Battell and Kate Nonesuch  teach Adult Basic Education at Malaspina College on Vancouver Island.  KINESIS "" msmsasmsasss^^  NEWS  DOCTORS from page 3  an action group and referral network in  Prince George—says her group set up a  temporary phone hne for people to call in  with experiences of abuse by doctors. "People who called our number told us it took  them days to pick up the phone and call  us—and we're not a professional group, just  a concerned citizen's group."  Says WAVAW's Pilot, "It seems the hne  has been established for data collection  rather than in the interests of women."  In fact, women who contact the hotline will have their call returned by feminist counsellors with extensive experience  in working with survivors of sexual abuse—  a fact the college would do well to publicize. Anneke Van Vliet, one of the counsellors, says that in the first week of operation,  they have received about 100 calls, all but  one from women.  "I emphasize to the caller that my role is  to take down information and to give support," says Van Vliet. "I am here to act as  an advocate for the victim and not to protect the doctor.  "We are hearing about the whole range of  sexual abuse, including inappropriate sexual comments, fondling, forced intercourse  and abusive medical procedures." The counseUors have a hst of therapists and women's  support services to pass on— therapists  who may be beyond the financial reach  of women, and services which are already  overextended.  In the Ontario inquiry, pubhc and private  hearings, as well as a hot-line, were offered.  Women are saying these options should be  available in BC.  "It's important to have the public discussion, for the committee members to meet  people and not to just get data third-  hand from the hothne workers," says Kate  Parfitt.  A Hidden Process  Historically, the college has taken a deterrent approach to sexual abuse: to be exact,  women have been deterred from reporting  their abuse.  Patricia Rebbeck says that in the last five  years, the CPSBC has received and investigated 42 complaints, a figure she calls "a  pretty good average." (Not very good, however, in the hght of the hothne's 100 calls in  its first week).  Until now, the college would not acknowledge a complaint unless it is in writing and  is signed.  A woman calling the CPSBC to inquire  about lodging a complaint will be told by  the receptionist that there are no written guidelines available regarding procedure. She will be told to write a detailed letter describing the abuse, complete with her  name, and will be asked permission for the  college to forward a copy of the letter to the  doctor in question.  Although this is just the beginning of  the procedure, many women never even get  to—let alone past—this point. Few people  are aware of the CPSBC's responsibility to  investigate complaints. If they are aware,  just thinking about writing such a letter is intimidating—just as the abuse was.  Women may lack writing skills—remember,  they are approaching a male-dominated,  professional body—a problem which is intensified if Enghsh is not their first language.

"There is a lack of communication between victims that's encouraged by the college's structure," says Lorek. She would hke  to see the names of doctors under investigation published in the newspaper, "just as  when charges are laid against somebody by  the courts. This would alert women to potential dangers ... and encourage others to  come forward if they also have complaints  against the same doctor."

This requirement shows no understanding of the pivotal  role of trust—and power—in doctor-patient  relationships, and how devastated a patient  feels when this trust is betrayed.  If a woman does manage to write a letter, the doctor in question provides a written response, and a college investigator then  decides whether there is a basis to proceed  with a further inquiry. H there is, a tribunal  of three members of the CPSBC council and  a lawyer convene, and they decide on the  guilt or innocence of the doctor. The doctor  may be punished with anything from a hght  reprimand to the revoking of his hcense to  practice. The college is the only body with  the power to revoke a doctor's hcense.  A doctor convicted by a criminal court  and sentenced to prison, even when the  crime is sexual abuse, does not automatically lose his hcense. When his prison term  is up, he can continue practicing unless the  college decides otherwise. Dr. Clive Ryan,  a psychiatrist convicted of indecent assault  in November 1990 still retains his hcense  while the CPSBC "investigates" whether or  not he should be allowed to continue his BC  practice.  "Many women are unwilling to go forward partly because the system is so unfriendly, and partly because of their shame,"  says Maureen McAvoy, a therapist who  works with women abused by physicians. "I  think that of the three channels of action a  woman can choose from [civil court, criminal court and the college], their sense is that  the college is the least safe. But they are  also very afraid of using the courts."

If you talk to the 12 witnesses in the Clark  case, the majority didn't even know the college existed."  Many suggestions are being made on  how to improve the complaint mechanism,  including hiring female investigators and  making advocates available to guide women  through the proceedings. WAVAW's Johanna Pilot would also hke the woman's  rights "clearly laid out and made public. At  this point, the college's basic proceedings  are quite mystifying."  Women who have been abused by a physician may lose some or all trust in the medical profession—and switching to a female  doctor may not always be an option. Ann  Johns says, "Here in Prince George, we have  very few women doctors. We also have very  few doctors of either sex who will take on  more patients, so you're limited in your  choices." Women may refuse to have physical examinations, or they may give up on  doctors entirely.  * Sexual abuse by a doctor can take  many forms: suggestive comments, inappropriate touching, verbal harassment, as well as forced contact and  rape.

This was only  the second time that the Folkloric Group  of the Association of Relatives of the De-  tained-Disapp eared of Chile (AFDD) had  appeared outside of their country.  Their performance of dance and song in  Vancouver on June 10 was part of a Canada-  wide tour sponsored by the AFDD in response to an invitation by the Paper Boat  Cultural Organization. Dozens of solidarity groups and development agencies across  Canada co-operated in making the tour a  reality.  The AFDD was formed in Chile as a natural reaction to the events which occurred  during the military regime imposed on the  people of Chile after the assassination of  Salvador Allende in 1973. When relatives  failed to return home after being detained  by government officials, families began to  search for the disappeared. Eighteen years  later the search continues.  As a result of an investigation carried out  by the National Commission on Truth and  Reconciliation, the results of which were announced on March 4, 1991, Chilean president Patricio Alwyn created the Pubhc  Rights Corporation to continue the investigation into the whereabouts of the disappeared and to determine personal responsibilities for the violation of human rights  during the Pinochet regime. According to  the AFDD the judicial system is standing in  the way of the work of this body by sheltering itself under the Amnesty Law decreed  by the military regime in 1978.  In an effort to gain international support  for their struggle to give powers to the Corporation so that it will force the judicial system to reopen cases of missing pohtical prisoners and find out definitively what happened to their loved ones, the folklore group  of the AFDD has brought their message to  Canada.  The words of one of their songs says it all:  "I will give my whole hfe to find out where  they are."  After the concert I was able to interview  the women of the Folkloric Group, wondering as I went how I could conduct an interview with 12 people. I needn't have worried. They had already set their chairs in a  semi-circle and proceeded through the help  of a translator to respond spontaneously to  my questions, each woman jumping in when  and if she wanted.  Gala Torres: Our group started in 1978,  on March 8, International Women's Day.  For the first time we played in a theatre  in Santiago. We did two songs: "La Cueca  Sola" and "What pain This Soul Feels" by  Violetta Parra. We did "La Cueca Sola" because it is the national dance of the country  and because it is a couple's dance. It is also  a love dance. We did it because dancing it  alone is a statement.  Lorraine Michael: Do you have freedom in Chile to carry out your program?  Gala: We sang during the time of the  dictatorship without any freedom at all to  do so, but this is our work and so we did  it. We were repressed for singing what we  sing, which was nothing more than to denounce the problem. Those were the years  when the military dictatorship denied the  existence of our families.  Over the years, we have sung day after  day, week after week, doing whatever possible to accept all the invitations to perform  that we receive. We have taken our singing  to the streets. We have been in university  precincts. We have sung for institutions hke  the Vicaria de la Solidaridad [Service for  Peace and Justice] and we performed in the  inaugural activities of International Week  for the Detained-Disappeared.  Lorraine: Were any of your members detained or lost during the dictatorship ?  Gala: No. They haven't disappeared, but  a lot of our women have died. In fact many  of them have died from cancer because of  the stress and pain that they have been suffering.  Lorraine: In your country are there  any men who have associated themselves with your struggle as women who  have lost children, husbands, fathers,  brothers and sisters?  Victoria Diaz: Our musical group is  made up only of women, but in fact there  are men who work with us in the struggle  and there is also a youth group working on  this problem.  Violetta Morales: The involvement of  women has to do with the makeup of the disappeared. There are 957 disappeared persons that we know about and of this number 58 are women.  Every time we went out into the streets to  denounce a disappearance and demand information about somebody, it was the men  with us who [the authorities] came down  heavily upon, and in many cases the men  ended up in jail. They would arrest the men  and not the women. We saw pretty quickly  that it was better if women did this work because of what was happening. Also, the few  men that were left had to continue to try to  work or, in many cases, leave the country in  exile.  Lorraine: I heard your message tonight during the concert and I wondered  if you believe you'll ever get peace?  Victoria: We'll feel peace when we know  something about our families, not out of  looking for vengeance. We'll feel some peace  when justice has been done. We're not  only thinking about our own country. We're  hnked with FEDEFAM (the Latin American Federation of the Relatives of Detained  and Disappeared Persons) which has hnks  in Central America. There are over 90,000  Top to bottom, right to left: Monica Rocha, Eliana Villaroel, Doris Maniconi, Violetta Morales,  Marta Perez, Mirella Rivera, Lady Gonzalez, Imelia Hermosilla, Ana Rojas, Victoria Diaz,  Gala Torres.  disappeared people in Latin America and  we're hoping to bring an end to this business. Then we will feel peace, when we have  really put an end to that problem.  Doris Maniconi: I think that in order  to find peace—as a mother, in terms of this  moral shame that has come down on our  country—Pinochet will be required to tell  the truth about what has happened. That  would bring me some peace.  Lorraine: Is there anything more that  you want to say to the women of  Canada?  Violetta: I guess one thing that we forgot to mention is that a lot of women who  disappeared were pregnant. They were in  advanced states of pregnancy at the time of  their disappearance.  Victoria: Also, the remains of these peo  ple have not been found and we beheve that  the Amnesty Law does not apply until those  people's remains have been found.  Violetta: The thing that is the most important for us is finding solidarity with people here and that people understand about  the letter that we are asking them to write  to our government. We're hoping that your  article will help influence people in that direction.  We would be very grateful if you would  publish the letter because it not only helps  us, but it helps to put pressure on the government to tell us where our relatives are.  Lorraine Michael is a social activist  and former community organizer fri  St. John's now living and writing in  Vancouver.  Letters of support for the struggle of the AFDD should be sent to:  ♦ President* de la Repnblica, Sr. Patricio Alwyn, Palacio la Moneda, Santiago, Chile  • Ministro de la Defensa, Sr. Patricio Rojas, Ministerio de Defensa, Edificio Diego Por-  tales, Santiago, Chile  ♦ Ministro de Justicia, Sr. Francisco Cumplido, Morande No. 134, Santiago, Chile.  Copies of all letters should also be sent to:  • Sola Sietra/Viviana Diaz, Plaza de Armas No. 444, Oficina 228, Santiago, Chile.  A typical letter could read as follows:  Dear [Official:] I salute your government's efforts to analyze the events following the military coup in 1973, until the present time. Chile needed a Commission on Truth & Reconciliation to lay the past 17 years of history to rest. In order to accomplish this, however, I  would urge your government to answer those families who are asking where their missing  loved ones are. They have a right to know where the remains of their loved ones rest.  I would also urge your government to bring to justice the perpetrators of the crimes  publicized in the Rettig report. It is not enough to verify that atrocities were committed.  The families of the slain need to know that the murderers of their loved ones are brought  to justice, and that these crimes will never again occur in Chile.  I also urge your government to abide by the International Agreements, especially the  San Jose de Costa Rica one agreement which ChUe signed.  Signed, [Your Name.]  Also send letters or copies of letters to Prime Minister Mulroney, leaders of opposition  parties, or Barbara McDougall, Minister for External Affairs.  KINESIS ^$$$^^,  International  Kali for Women:  For the Indian feminist  as told to Zara Suleman  Kali for Women is India's first feminist  publishing house. Established in 1984 and  based in Delhi, Kali for Women's main focus is publishing "Third World studies on  women" while also being a forum for the  concerns of South Asian and Third World  women.  Ritu Menon and Urvashi Butali, founders  of Kali for Women, attended the Paci-  fica Pubhshing conference in Vancouver recently, and were kind enough to take time  out of their busy schedule to talk to Kinesis writer Zara Suleman.  Zara Suleman: How was Kali for  Women set up?  Ritu Menon: Urvashi and I set it up  as a trust: we co-opted four other women  trustees who were sympathetic and were related to its activities in various ways. Kali  for Women is still more or less hke that, the  two of us work at it on an everyday 1  the others don't, but they're still a  Zara: Do you take on Indian writers  who have made submissions to you, or  do you initiate contact with authors?  Urvashi Butali: Usually we ask people  to write books on particular subjects which  we think would be of interest and which are  ...groups are working  on...vio!ence,  communalism...and on  the increasing religious  fundamentalism  in India.  current, or we would search for stories and  novels to translate from Indian languages  into Enghsh. We do books and pamphlets  which are used by activist groups. Our writers are Indian writers mainly, but also writers from other parts of the world: we have  a Moroccan writer, a Pakistani writer, a  Sri Lankan writer, and we will expand that  gradually.  Zara: What are some of your current  publishing projects?  Ritu: There's a range—the kind of issues  and books we cover are from very academic  to what Urvashi said, pamphlets and monographs and things hke that. There's fiction,  and a sort of biography through letters, and  academic books on different disciplines. We  have two books on the women's movement  in India. Both of them are from shghtly different perspectives: one is illustrated and  the other is issue specific. We publish some  books on identity, on rehgion and on gender.  There is potentially something on health  ... so it's a very varied range.  Almost all of our publications are about  issues that are fairly current, so each addresses one aspect but is of course quite  related to everything else. The fiction—we  don't see the creative writing as being dissociated from what the academic writing  is doing. They are both touching upon the  same realities of hfe.  Zara: So much of what we hear about  the activism of women in India is distorted by the commercial market. I  would be interested to know what kind  of activism is really going on in feminist groups.  Urvashi: There's a lot of activism in India on different issues which has always been  there—always, meaning since this current  phase of the women's movement. Basically,  groups are working on areas such as violence, communalism (which divides different communities by rehgion), and against  the increasing religious fundamentalism in  India. There's a lot of work going on in media, there are women's magazines coming  out, and a women's book shop.  In this recent election campaign, women  tried to get together with pohticians to  demand of them what they would do for  women, or what promises they were making  for women in their manifestos. So there's a  range of things which are issue-based and  ongoing.  Zara: How has support been for Kali  for Women?  Ritu: Terrific support from individuals  and organizations, even financial support. It  actually hasn't been that problematic. We  sometimes wish that Kali for Women could  be more visible.  It would be nice to have more to  publish—just to have a greater volume—  but because a lot of what we publish is commissioned and is being done newly, it is understandable that it takes a while to get  written and correspondingly a longer time  to get produced.  * * *  Here's a sampling of Kali for Women's English-language titles drawn  from the publisher's catalogue:  MUSLIM WOMEN IN INDIA  Political & Private Realities:  1890s-1980s  by Shahida Lateef  This book examines the manner and extent to which the status of Mushm women  in India is affected by being Indian, being  Mushm and being women. It evaluates their  role in a society in terms of current practices  and attitudes and also examines the historical factors which have influenced it.  ISSUES AND IDEOLOGY IN THE  INDIAN WOMEN'S MOVEMENT  by Nandita Gandhi and Nandita Shah  This book examines a wide range of issues and their underlying ideologies taken  up by the third wave of the women's movement in India, over the last decade and a  half. They raise problems that address the  issues of the relationship of the women's  movement with the State, the troubled area  of foreign funding, the tentative steps into  electoral pohtics, the personal dilemmas of  the activists, the uneasy and ambivalent relationship of the movement to the government and to State structures.  THE HISTORY OF DOING  An Illustrated Account of the  Women's Movement in India  by Radha Kumar  A thematic history of the women's movement in India both before and after independence, this book covers the period from  the nineteenth century to the present day. It  looks at how women's issues were raised, initially by men and as part of the movements  for social reform, and then with the involvement of women in the nationalist movement, by women themselves.  STAYING ALIVE  Women, Ecology and  Survival in India  by Vandana Shiva  This book argues that there is an intimate hnk between the degradation of  women and degradation of nature in contemporary society. The author, a physicist  tributed both to the general subordination  of Indian women, and to the relative success  of individual women who come from less  impoverished urban families, in achieving a  measure of personal freedom. The authors  trace the present-day emergence of some  women from high caste seclusions to professional employment, examining their circumstances and responses.

CROSSLAND CONSULTING  Personal Management  Services for Artists  Grant and Proposal Writing Bookkeeping Services  FIRST CONSULTATION FREE  Jackie Crossland  By Appointment Only 435-2273  I  n KINESIS Banff Conference:  Beyond survival to action  as told to Jackie Brown  It was an exhilarating and often disturbing four  days, as delegates from across Canada gathered  in Banff for the Canadian Mental Health  Association's Women and Mental Health-Women  in a Violent Society conference in May.  Exhilarating because the conference revealed the depth of women's  commitment to ending violence against women, with over 1,000 survivors, activists and helping professionals coming together to share their  experiences and knowledge and lend each other support.  Disturbing, because the conference made it clear how pervasive the  violence is. Women spoke candidly and often at personal risk, about  wife and child sexual assault, abuse within the medical and mental  health systems by "trusted" doctors and psychiatrists, date rape, violence against the elderly, the growing impact of pornography, the special  vulnerability of women with disabihties and more. Survivors told their  stories and many named their rapists on a board set up outside the plenary hall.  Disturbing too, as women of colour took to the podium Saturday  night to publicly express their anger at once again attending a conference that was overwhelmingly white.  Keynote speaker Andrea Dworkin set the tone when she told delegates "we are in a state of emergency" and urged them to accept the reality of violence and take stronger action to end it. "We are hving under a reign of terror," she said, adding that the war against women is  real. Rejecting more education as a solution, Dworkin said rapists already know that rape is wrong. "It is time to put our bodies between  the rapist and his victim, and the pornographer and his victim."  Shirley Turcotte, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and subject  of the film "To a Safer Place" moved many women to tears as she described her own experience with ritual abuse and her struggle to survive  the horrors. Helping professionals must be more thoughtful and sensitive  in their approach, she said, and beheve the unbelievable and hear the  unspeakable so that sexual abuse survivors do not feel further silenced.  "Don't collude with my denial and your terror," said Turcotte.  Rosemary Brown, president of MATCH International, reminded delegates that if sisterhood is indeed global, feminists in North America  must pay more attention and lend their support to women in other  countries, many of whom experience violence that includes pohtical torture. She also urged white women to hsten to women of colour when  they talk about the effects of being underrepresented at conferences and  other events. "After all," she said, "There is no feminism where there is  racism."  Kate Millet, whose recent book The Looney Bin Trip describes  her experiences as a survivor of psychiatry, condemned the "mystification and medicalization" of mental illness- -a process, she says, that has  transformed psychiatry into the perfect method of social control. "It is  a cheap method of enforcing conformity and social control that is terrifying," said the author of Sexual Politics. "Once the system touched  only a few unfortunates who were victims of their relatives. Now it infringes on a vast number of hves and particularly on the poor ... and  always women ... whenever we are inconvenient or hard to manage or  disposable, as we so frequently are."  While the conference was unrelenting in revealing the extent and effects of violence against women, it also focused on strategies for change.  In this, a number of speakers, delegates and workshop facilitators called  for more direct action to end the systemic physical and sexual abuse of  women and children.  For many, this will require a rejuvenation of the "personal is the pohtical" as part of women's recovery process. The concern is that while  individual healing is important, the current emphasis on therapy may  be taking away from pohtical action also necessary to women's survival  and change. Focusing more attention on the connection between individual abuse and the larger society that promotes and condones violence  against women they say, will not only assist the survival process, but  will help women move beyond survival to action.  Carta McKague:  "The Valium epidemic  for ...women is  still very much with us."  Carla McKague is a Toronto lawyer and mental health law specialist with Ontario's Advocacy Resource Centre for the Handicapped  (ARCH). She is also a founder of the now defunct Phoenix Rising, a  magazine written by and for ex-psychiatric inmates. As an ex-inmate,  McKague has had first-hand experience with a mental health care system she says is particularly harsh towards women. She is a long-time  member of the anti-psychiatry movement in Canada and is fairly pessimistic about the value of therapy—feminist or not. While McKague  does not condemn all therapy, she says even the best therapeutic relationship is plagued by an inherent power imbalance. For her, a supportive network of friends and family is the key to women's health and survival.  McKague spoke to Kinesis reporter Jackie Brown.  Jackie Brown: How did you get involved with the anti-psychiatry  movement?  Carla McKague: I had been a psychiatric patient in 1963 and spent  several months in two separate hospitals. I went through electroshock  therapy. I got out and got on with my hfe, had children, completed  math degrees, got a job that I hked and things generally went well for  the next several years. Then I saw people close to me getting shafted by  doctors. An aunt had Parkinson's disease that went undiagnosed for two  years. Her doctor kept telling her it was her nerves and gave her Valium. I had a friend who had a freak out and they rushed her to a psychiatric hospital and dumped her full of antipsychotic drugs. Nobody  checked and she was three weeks pregnant. She had a seriously handicapped child as a result of that httle trip to the hospital.  I saw these things happening and started to get angry and wonder  why no one was doing anything about it.  The culminating event was when it happened to me again. I was having some serious marital problems and I hadn't learned my lesson from  15 years earlier and consulted a psychiatrist who broke confidentiality. He threatened that if I didn't make the disclosure to my husband  that he wanted me to make, he would do it himself. I charged him with  breaking confidentiahty and the College let him off on a technicality.  Anyway, my husband and I managed to patch things up and I decided to go to law school. That was in 1977. During my first year, the  marriage went up in flames for good and I was in the suicidal depths.  But I was smart enough to stay out of the hospital this time.  Cont on next page  KINESIS Com from previous page  I was also volunteering a couple of afternoons a week at the Queen  Street mental health centre and that brought back some old memories.  Here it was 15 years later and people were still being dehumanized, over-  medicated and treated hke things. Then I met Don Weitz, who started  the Ontario Mental Patients Association and he got me involved in the  organization.  So I was looking at total chaos in my own hfe, seeing people struggling with the mental health care system and others who had gotten  through it, and everything chcked. I decided that this is what I wanted  to do. I helped Don found Phoenix Rising, and also helped get ARCH  going. I've been there for the past five years.  Jackie: There has been quite a lot of discussion at the conference  about the "therapization of feminism;" that perhaps, feminist therapy has become too much therapy and not enough feminism. As a  critic of the mental health care system, what are your thoughts on  this issue?  Carla: I know women who say they've been helped by therapy, but  I'm very ambivalent largely because I'm nervous about any relationship  in which one person professes to be able to help the other without it being mutual. The difference between a counselhng session with the best,  most sensitive therapist in the world and a talk with a friend is profound. One dynamic in the counselhng setting is where one person is the  helper and the other is the helpee—and that's in a good relationship.  The other is where the therapist tells the person what to do and they  do it.  Friends help each other. I cry on your shoulder today and tomorrow  it will be the other way around. There may be periods when one person has more needs than the other and it gets a httle out of whack for a  while, but it comes back into shape.  I don't totally damn all therapy. There have been a couple of points  in my hfe where it has helped. My concern about feminist therapy or  at least my doubts about it, is that I don't think you can avoid the fact  that there is a power imbalance.  Jackie: What about an issue like sexual abuse, which a friend  might not feel they know enough about or be able to handle. Isn't  this where a trained counsellor can be beneficial?  Carla: I think that what would be better, or at least a useful supplement, is sitting down with other people who have shared your experience, where the pain is a common pain and the fear is a common fear.  I know that for me, as a former psychiatric inmate, getting involved  with On Our Own (formerly the Ontario Mental Patients Association)  was an extraordinary experience. These were people who, in the ordinary course of my hfe, I would probably never have run across. They  came from varied socio-economic backgrounds but what we all had in  common was an experience that was quite awful. We could say things  to one another with a hfted eyebrow that would have taken hours to explain to someone else. There was a mutuality—you prop me up today, I  prop you up tomorrow and I've never seen as healing an environment as  that was.  Jackie: Can that kind of support also kelp women who are doing  healing or recovery work move to action against violence against  women?  Carla: Yes it can. It takes time to grow and these kinds of support  organizations and groups are sort of formless and probably should be.  They also have a limited hfe. The initial energy and commitment won't  last forever and you either fossilize or you die and get reborn out of the  fire again.  But [these groups] serve different purposes for different people. One  is support—the feehng that this is the one place that I can walk into  where nobody can look down on me because I'm a mental patient because we're all mental patients. Then you can use that to build a philosophy, a goal, a way of dealing with the traumatic events that brought  you together in the first place and you can gradually start looking at  what went wrong and planning how it can be fixed. You can build a  power base to start from. This is not uphill though; it's up and down,  and there are failures and you start over again.  Jackie: So while you don't completely reject individual therapy,  you lean heavily towards friend and family support ?  Carla: Absolutely. That's what got me through it. That's what got  almost everyone I know who got through it, through it. It's not pills and  shock treatment. CounseUors can help but if you don't have that supportive network of friends, you're not going to make it.  Jackie: Are there any issues that friends can't deal with?  Carla: There are some that are hard for them to deal with. About  five years after my first year of law school I sat down with a woman  who had become a close friend in law school. You know, suddenly from  across the room our eyes met and we were the two with the grey hair.  Her marriage had also broken up and she and her children and I and my  daughter were sharing a house.  We were sitting around one night having a drink and I asked her to  tell me what I was hke that first year of law school. I can remember sitting in my apartment curled up in a ball, rocking for hours to get rid  of the pain. But I wanted to know what it looked hke from the outside.  My friend, whose former career was as a psychiatric nurse, told me that  never in her personal or professional career had she seen anybody in  as much pain as I was. She used to go to bed every night not sure if I  would be alive in the morning and it wasn't even primarily suicide she  was worried about. She thought I was just going to die and she said it  was the hardest thing she ever did to not get someone to hospitalize me.  Jackie: Why didn't she?  Carla: A behef that I had the right to make my own decisions. Some  kind of faith that, rough as it was, I could get through it. And she was  enormously personaUy supportive to me during the time. As a former  psychiatric nurse she knew what it was hke in an institution. She didn't  want me to miss a year of law school. But it was enormously difficult for  her not to intervene, not to shake me and say get your ass in there and  take pUls. She let me experience the pain.  Jackie: Are women who turn to psychiatrists still being drugged  and basically put out of service as they were say, 20 years ago?  Carla: Oh very much. The vahum epidemic for 40 year-old women  is stiU very much with us. You know, somebody who is 40 and suffering from "empty nest syndrome," her husband has left her for another  woman and she's unhappy so instead of dealing with the fact that there  are actually things that are making her unhappy, you give her vahum  and anti-depressants and zonk her out. It's a very, very wrong-headed  approach. And electroshock therapy is stiU the most violent modality  "My concern about feminist therapy  is...the fact that there is a power  imbalance."  used against women. Two and a half to three times as many women as  men get this treatment.  Jackie: Why hasn't this situation changed?  Carla: Because frankly, I don't think doctors see much of an alternative and maybe they have a point. Why are there so many 40 year old,  unhappy women who have nothing to do with themselves now? Why  are they saying, the chUdren are gone and my hfe is empty? This is a  real problem and the solution is not easy. ... We shouldn't be numbing  women's pain; we should be helping people get past the pain and buUd a  new hfe for themselves.  Jackie: There doesn't seem to be very much room for pain in this  society. We 're told to push it down, drug it away. Don't experience  it.  Carla: Yes and for me that's wrong. What you're doing is anesthetizing people to an unacceptable reality and what we should be doing is  making the god damned reality acceptable and changing things around  us so that we can Uve without drugs and hurt and aU kinds of things. I  wUl not accept that the way to get rid of that dissonance between ourselves and the world is to change ourselves—it's changing the world.  Jackie: Some people are concerned that compared to the 70s,  when it was a key movement issue, feminism isn't paying enough  attention to the kinds of psychiatric abuses you've been talking  about and needs to collaborate more with the anti-psychiatry movement. Would you agree ?  Carla: It's hard to say because I'm not as directly involved with the  anti-psychiatry movement as I used to be. These days I work more as a  lawyer than a psychiatric survivor so I don't feel as much in touch with  what's going on in the movement.  But certainly I think that the feminist and anti-psychiatry movements  are two areas that ought to come together and stiU often do. For example, our new Ontario Psychiatric Survivors Alhance has a committed  feminist as its co-ordinator and I'm pleased about that. So women are  running things more. Feminism as a movement, as a phUosophy, can do  an enormous amount in terms of changing women's reality. On a 'let's  go out and change society basis' it's fantastic.  But frankly, the missing hnk here is that we, as anti-psychiatric activists need a closer linkage and partnership with the lesbian community  because that is where you're going to get strong and committed leaders.  Also, because of the way society deals with sexual orientation, there are  a number of lesbians who have been psychiatrized, who have had the experience of people saying that who they are is evil and trying to beat it  out of them with shock or by locking them up or whatever.  I'm personaUy very sorry that we never made a stronger linkage  there, although we did try. Phoenix Rising did an issue on the psychi-  atrization of sexual preference. I would very much hke to see these communities come together. I'm not excluding gay men because they very  much belong in the picture, but if you're going to have strong feminist  leaders the lesbian community is the best place to look for them.  Jackie: As a lawyer with ARCH, a key focus of your work is seeing that the legal rights of people with disabilities are protected.  What are some of the issues of most concern to people with disabilities?  Carla: There are so many it's hard to know where to start. You  say law and disabihty and what pops into everybody's mind is human  rights, discrimination. In fact, we do only a small number of human  , KINESIS rights cases. We deal with issues such as accessibihty to transportation,  from the airlines to the Toronto subway, income tax issues, and aU kinds  of social assistance issues. My field is mental health law and some of  these issues, hke consent to care, quality of care, deinstitutionalization  and immigration, carry out into the broader community.  We also do quite a bit of test case htigation where we think we can  change the law or pohcy to achieve wider benefits for people with disabiUties. And we get involved in certain cases, such as the Swain decision, where we and others said that parts of the system of Lieutenant  Governor's warrants applied to people found not guilty by reason of insanity, violates equahty sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Jackie: In your keynote speech you talked about how women with  disabilities are particularly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse.  Some of the statistics you cited are really frightening.  Carla: They are. We have studies showing that people with disabilities are physicaUy and sexuaUy abused at least one and a half times  more than people who don't have disabihties. Eighty percent of the victims are women and 93 percent of the abusers are men. And this does  not include the even higher incidences of verbal and emotional abuse reported by most women with disabihties. We also know that women with  intellectual handicaps are more hkely to be abused over long periods of  time and that the risks increase for women with multiple handicaps.  Some of the reasons for this violence are obvious: women with physical problems don't have the same abihty to resist or get away from an  attacker. Women who have difficulty seeing have problems identifying an  attacker. Women who can't speak can't call out for help. Women who  are totally dependant on care givers or family members are vulnerable  to abuse. Women with intellectual impairments are considered "safe"  victims because the pohce and the courts won't beheve them.  Jackie: You also said that these attacks are often not reported.  Could you elaborate on why this is the case ?  Carla: Many women, whether they are disabled or not, are reluctant to report an attack and fear is a big factor. But if a woman is totaUy dependant on a caregiver, for example, she not only has the fear  of not being beheved, she faces the threat of more violence or that she  wfll be left helpless. Or she might not be able to get away from him to  call the pohce. Another problem is that very few women's shelters, crisis  centres and pohce stations have telephone devices for the deaf or signers  so that women can call or communicate in person and they're also not  wheelchair accessible.  The other side of this is that when women do report an attack, they  "The worst [thing] is the backlash,  the continuing public misconception  that crazy equates with dangerous."  often can't get the help they need because women's shelters or rape crisis centres are so strapped for money and staff they have a hard enough  time helping non-disabled women get through the justice system, let  alone a woman with a disabihty.  And then there are the incredibly cruel attitudes these women are  up against. We know of more than one case where a pohce officer has  told a woman who was raped that she should be happy to get the attention. But the most common problem is that the pohce or the crown or  a judge decides they aren't competent to testify and so charges either  aren't laid or they get dropped.  Jackie: What kinds of solutions would you propose?  Carla: We need to create an atmosphere that takes these women seriously and wUl do something about their attackers. If women know they  can get help, more of them wUl be willing to come forward.  That wUl also mean creating safe places that are adequately staffed  with workers who are sensitive to issues surrounding disabiUties and  that are accessible. The same goes for pohce stations and court rooms.  And we need to keep working on changing prejudicial attitudes. I would  also hke to see more self-defense and assertiveness training courses for  women with disabihties so they aren't so vulnerable.  Jackie: What are the least and most hopeful developments you  see in terms of the mental health care system in Canada ?  Carla: The most hopeful thing I see is profound changes taking place  in terms of legislation. For the first time in our laws, and this varies  from province to province, there is the realization that crazy people are  not necessarUy incompetent and that they should retain control over  what happens to them. If there are periods when they are incompetent,  we should look at what they wanted when they were competent. We  should respect their wishes, views, hfestyles and preferences and grant  them the dignity that we grant medical patients and everybody else to  make their own decisions.  The worst is the backlash, the continuing public misconception that  crazy equates with dangerous. That if we could just shut those loonies  up the world would be a better place and maybe it would be even better if we just knock them all off. We've had enormous success changing laws but the big fight now is to get the law respected and enforced.  We'll have to fight very hard to make the laws respected and observed  so that when the law says you can't forcibly treat that woman and then  someone treats that woman, there is a penalty and a sanction.  We've changed the law on paper now we have to change it in practice  and only graduaUy, through that process, wUl we change attitudes.  Sandra Butler:  "Too many have come  to believe that  all we are is our pain."  Among those who worry about what some call "the therapization of  feminism" is Sandra Butler, author of the groundbreaking book Conspiracy of Silence—the Trauma of Incest. Butler, who hves in San  Francisco, has spent the past 20 years working with survivors and travels extensively throughout the United States and Canada giving lectures  and workshops on violence against women.  For Butler, whUe sMUful, empathic healing that helps women remember and relive the pain of their abuse is a crucial part of healing work,  she questions whether feminist therapy has become "too much therapy  and not enough feminism."  Jackie Brown: In your keynote address you talked about feminist therapy becoming too much therapy and not enough feminism.  Could you elaborate on what you mean ?  Sandra Butler: Feminist therapy came about as a consequence of  our thinking about the intersections between personal pain and social  structure. Our understanding must remain imbedded in the awareness  that personal change is only the first important step to poUtical change.  One cannot happen without the other but both are necessary.  Jackie: So the "personal is the political" is also part of the process?  Sandra: Always. In every moment. For example, when I'm doing  work with survivors of sexual abuse and they tell me their particular,  concrete experiences and horrible feehngs, I remind them that other  women who have had similar experiences have simUar kinds of feeUngs.  It isn't that I'm taking away from their individual experiences but I'm  always trying to find a way to say that this is a shared experience and  to ground it in an understanding of oppression.  Also, I find a lack of analysis about why we eat too much, or go to  the maU and buy things we can't afford, become co-dependents, find  ourselves trapped in unsatisfactory relationships and other behaviours  that are typically troublesome for women. There is so httle analysis  about our bodies and Uttle awareness that it is the only landscape upon  which we Uve. We paint it, pluck it, decorate it and make it smaller because so few of us have a world in which to enact our hves. Instead, we  enact our hves on our bodies and we self-mutilate in both smaU and  large ways—some of which are culturaUy acceptable and some of which  are not.  Women can be in "recovery" for years without any awareness of the  social and material conditions of being a woman. There is httle analysis  of class, sexuahty, race, age and how those things affect the way we experience pain and loss. It's aU become personalized and individualized.  Disconnected.  Com on next page  KINESIS Com from previous page  Jackie: But even as more survivors connect their individual experiences to women's oppression, isn't it difficult to shift into political action when you're in the midst of recovery?  Sandra: Psychological health is an important prerequisite for good  poUtical activism. But part of what is dangerous in our healing or recovery work is the need and longing for safety.  There is no safety and if we wait for safety to do the organizing we  have to do, nothing wiU happen. What do we do when we are in danger? How do we protect ourselves? We cannot require our pohtical comrades to create a safe place for us. We have to work together as allies  and that's not always about safety. We have to find a balance between  healing, buUding community and creating pohtical alliances. For a lot of  women who are doing healing work, it's the interminable narcissism of  their own buUy-buttons and they're not being responsible to the larger  community. We need to buUd a movement with women who are doing  their own healing work, who understand that our experiences are more  the same than different and who know that none of us are safe untU ah  of us are safe. That is when we can begin to organize and bring about  change.  I also think that professional clinicians who are trained or identify as  feminists, who do women-focused work, need to do more volunteer work  in the community. There needs to be more giving back to the grassroots  community in the form of facilitation, traimng or activism that keeps  each of us connected with each other in our shared work.  "We cannot require our political  comrades to create a safe place  for us."  Jackie: So survivors must move into political arena. What about  the other side of that? What should activists be aware of?  Sandra: I think it's important for grassroots women not to be judgmental about the importance of good clinical healing work. What I've  seen in a lot of coUectives and organizations is that, when we don't  understand our own issues, we act them out in collective situations.  When for whatever reasons we have difficulty with authority or powerful  people—and for survivors the reasons are obvious—we don't have many  clear ways of dealing with the conflict because the way we negotiate and  have conflict with each other has been so damaged by the culture.  The more we know about the complexity of our interior landscape,  the more we can tolerate and engage with the complexity of other  women.  I am also very concerned about some activism, that I think is dangerous, that uses pohtical rhetoric for psychological reasons. We need to  keep these two things as distinct as possible. This is tricky and I know  this from my own therapy. I created a world view that made my personal hfe make sense. There are a lot of us who cloak ourselves in pohtical rhetoric as a way of looking away from the real personal wounds we  need to be attending to. It's a very dehcate thing and I don't think you  can criticize femimst clinicians without criticizing activists. I think that  aU of us need to understand that we need each other, that we each can  only do a smaU piece of what has to be done. We need to understand  psychologicaUy who we are, how we do our interpersonal relationships in  the world.  Jackie: You talked earlier about the lack of analysis of race and  class. Many white women are experiencing a lot of difficulties trying to understand and confront their racism. What are some of  your thoughts on how we can better deal with this ?  Sandra: As white women, we need to understand that we cannot  wait for women of colour to do anti-racist work. From what I've seen  women of colour have been more patient with us than we deserve.  White women need to be doing this work with each other.  We need to begin to understand our internalized racism and not wait  for women of colour to be our informational resource. White women  carry assumptions of privUege around with us that we aren't even aware  of, hke always knowing that wherever we go there wUl be famiUar food,  music, or that the person in charge wUl almost always be of our colour.  Organizing is starting to happen and it's been good and also very difficult particularly for white women because, as we organize around the  issues of violence against women, we have to understand that race and  class are a matter of hfe and death. We have to work with women, and I  say this as a white woman, who we don't know much about, who we've  had httle exposure to and very Uttle sensitivity towards. The organizing  we need to do now is more complex and there needs to be more sharing  of power which we as a movement have a hard time with.  It's going to be painful, hard work but we're just going to have to  keep on doing it and keep on learning. We also have to take seriously  the criticism we receive and find ways to be respectful allies to women  of other races and nations who are doing our shared work.  We have to find ways to struggle together in love. Conflict is potentiaUy adversarial and it's hard for survivors—especiaUy because we have  often developed an adversarial relationship with the world in order to  survive. But when we gather together as comrades and allies we need to  remember our adversaries are the external structures that oppress aU of  us, albeit differently. That energy should not implode within our movement.  Jackie: In a recent interview, you said you were concerned about  some of the norms you see developing within the recovery, or, as  some call it, the 12 Step movement. What are some examples ?  Sandra: Truthfully, I feel very concerned about the recovery movement. What I see is too many women who have taken on an identity by  defining themselves as having a disease. But we did not go through the  painful process of moving from victims to survivors only to retreat to an  identity as disease carriers.  I fear that we feel so atomized, alienated and disconnected that what  is offered to us, and I think this was a big failing of feminism, is that if  we define ourselves as having a disease we are offered immediate, unquestioned community. Every Tuesday night no matter what city you're  in, you're going to find a church basement fiUed with people who share  your disease and they become your community. I see an awful lot of  women spending what httle time they have left after their domestic or  work hfe going to meetings instead of organizing against the structures  that oppress us.  What troubles me is—course there is a need for community and  belonging—but that in the group structure, in order to have that, we  are required to internahze a negative self-label. We cannot be women  who are fierce, strong, vital, in charge of our own Uves. One of the  things that saddens me is that too many of us have come to beheve that  aU we are is our pain. We are wounded as women in many ways and we  need to attend to those wounds. But we have also survived and I don't  think we congratulate ourselves enough about that.  For me, survival is not a feminist rhetorical flourish; it's a very serious word because the moment a chUd is abused her chUdhood ends and  her survival begins. This doesn't mean that what she did to survive at  four years old wiU necessarUy continue to help her at forty, but if she  hadn't figured out as a chUd what to do, she wouldn't be here now. It is  important that we understand ourselves psychologicaUy and pohticaUy  so that we don't have too much mental healthing and not enough movement buUding.  Jackie: You also say that women need to beware of the exalted  experts with all the answers.  Sandra: We need to be very careful as a movement about the capitalistic impulse in doing mental health work. There are lots of people  becoming [experts] and we as women and as survivors are particularly  vulnerable because too many of us stiU see authority figures as people  who "know." We need to be careful about trusting just anyone who says  'trust me' because that's what we got told as kids. We have to be sure  that these people are speaking in our best interests, not theirs.  Jackie: In your keynote, you spoke about the importance of seeking the spiritual within ourselves, rather than looking for it in  other cultures. Could you elaborate on that?  Sandra: This too needs to be thought about with tenderness. It's the  same way I think about the recovery movement. There is a longing for  meaning, for ritual and that is as it should be. And there is a longing in  white culture and white Protestant culture in particular, for ritual that  is not male ritual. There is also the danger of unexamined arrogance  of white skin that says 'there's something I want, FU just take it'—the  spiritual colonialism impulse. But I don't think it's mean-spirited. The  women I meet who are incorporating women's spirituality into their  healing or recovery feel very genuine. But I wonder how we can create  rituals together that are generative and embedded in our hves.  In Judaism there was a movement among both heterosexual and lesbian feminists to rewrite the hturgy and I found that very exhilarating.  I think that we as women have to go back to the hved experiences instead of saying there's nothing to take from there or looking at other  cultures. I think many women are attempting to find what I would call  a relationship to the sacred. One that is internal and wUl nourish us.  Jackie: Your latest book, Cancer in Two Voices, tells the story of  your lover Barbara Rosenblum's struggle with and eventual death  from cancer. What did you learn from that experience ?  Sandra: One of the most important things I learned is that class is a  matter of hfe and death and I think I never really understood that before. If Barbara had not had the class background she had, she would  have had a private doctor. Barbara said once that she learned more in  her famUy about what was a good butcher, what made a good cut of  meat, than she learned about what made a good doctor. One of the  things about our relationship was that every place we went, she saw  class and I saw gender. So I feel I incorporate that Une of vision much  more.  PohticaUy, I understand the national organizing we have to do around  the pohtics of health care, women's health care and more specificaUy,  the pohtics of lesbian health care. A lot of health providers don't know  their patients are lesbians and many women are not out to their health  care provider. So I hope the book wUl generate discussion about some of  these issues.  I think that I also have a very acute sense of urgency about time. I  don't waste it. I don't spend time with people I don't want to spend  time with. I have no problem saying no to things I don't want to deal  with. I don't feel the need to be approved of or accepted and the trade  off is the time that I have. I take more risks, I'm braver. I don't know if  that's because Barbara loved me so weU or because Barbara got cancer  and died. I think it's some of both.

Lies and Labels was  put together by the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, PoweU Street Festival and the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre in early  June. Panels consisted of women and men of  colour including Margo Kane, Lorena Gale,  Veena Sood, Diane Kadota, Zainub Verjee  and Loretta Todd.  Lies and Labels, Uke any forum on race,  should ideally bring about change—or at  least strategizing for change. Unfortunately,  hke other forums on race, what ends up happening is less than ideal. Tension, anger and  hostility were the outcome of the day-long  forum.  Margo Kane introduced the forum with  te insights into the problems faced  "anger has to be aUowed", and "it's not easy  to know that you may be a part of the problem."  After a short half hour break—barely  enough time to recover from the variety of  emotions that fiUed the centre—the next  panel took their place to continue the dis-  1 debate.  by women of colour in the arts, through her  own painful memories of starting out in "the  "I got aU the ethnic roles," Kane recalled. LabeUing became important not only  in terms of acting and dancing, but also in  terms of "ethnicity." She realized that this  labeUing by the arts community was only  a microcosm of society's labeUing, and that  her skiUs as an actor and dancer were being  excluded.  Kane spoke with emotion about the  responsibihties of producers, casting and  artistic directors. "Don't go looking out for  that face, that colour, don't go looking for  us—get to know us as people, it's a very human thing."  Kane also talked about how exhausting  it is to "break down doors" and to "have to  educate aU of the time." If people communicate, there exists the possibihty of "making  things work." But, as Kane views it, nothing  wUl change untU people stop asking "How  do we get these people involved?" instead  of doing what's necessary: hearing, seeing,  and caring about aU people, not just those  that white society chooses to recognize.  Kane set minds racing and left many  questions to be answered with her intense introduction which ended on the note:  Lorena Gale, a local Vancouver actor who  performed in The Coloured Museum and  Veena Sood, a Vancouver actor whose one-  woman show Maharani and the Maple  Leaf played at last year's Fringe Festival,  were featured on the panel titled "Behind  the Mask—The Artists."  Early in her presentation, Gale stated  that: "Canadian theatre is racist" and  "roles given to people of colour are always background, always menial." Gale  then talked about the society we hve in and  the restrictions faced by people of colour  even when they are born and raised here as  "Canadians".  "I wUl always be perceived as an outsider,  my chUdren wUl be seen as immigrants, although they wUl be fourth generation Canadians," said Gale. When the issue of community and Black theatre were thrown into  the discussion after Gale's presentation, she  responded: "I don't think Black theatre is  going to help ... when Black people try to  express themselves independently the white  establishment sUences them."  She spoke of the marginalization of people of colour, the flood of racist plays—  under the guise that the play is not racist  but only portrays racism—and the fact that  people of colour cannot raise these issues  themselves because their voices have been  sUenced, ignored, and taken away.  Veena Sood foUowed Gale's presentation  and gave a different perspective on Vancouver theatre. Sood describes her personal experience in Vancouver theatre as a "positive, embracing experience." During the  debate that foUowed, Sood was chaUenged  about this perspective and about her responsibiUty to the Indo-Canadian community, as an Indo-Canadian woman who has  broken down the doors and  "made it."  There was no negating that Sood is an  accomplished actor, only that her perspective could be viewed as an exception and  not generalized.  The next panel titled "Vultures or Visionaries," consisted of festival, theatre and  concert producers. Diane Kadota talked  about her individual experience as a producer and also about her vision for the  shows she takes on and produces.  Diane Kadota, an Asian-Canadian woman, is an independent performing arts  manager who works with the PoweU Street  Festival—the annual Japanese-Canadian  festival in Vancouver—and seven individual artists. She also currently represents  the Frank Chickens (an Asian feminist duo)  who were featured at last year's Folk Festival.  Kadota talked about wanting to produce festivals and her decision to fight for  the right to be where she didn't always  feel welcome. "Don't be intimidated," was  Kadota's advice for being a woman of colour  producer. "It helps to have some sort of  vision, some sort of determination." She  talked about going to cultural events and  how she would, "gravitate towards people  of colour performers." Throughout her presentation Kadota stressed: "I beheve theatre should be accessible to everybody."  Questions and a heavy debating session foUowed the panel presentations. After the dinner break, the final panel included presentations by Loretta Todd and  Zainub Verjee, titled "Where Outreach  meets Outrage—The System."  Verjee went on to say: "Interestingly,  enough, the [people of the] diaspora in the  Western world have had less access to media technology and production possibilities  than their counterparts in the countries  they have left behind. The West not only  [controls the populations] in other countries  through its foreign pohcies and economic  activity, but finds the way to manage and  contain resettled people through its domes-  Loretta Todd is a Native woman involved  in video and filmmaking. Her discussion revolved around the issues of cultural appropriation, post-modernism, and the traditions of the artist. Todd questioned why—  at this point in time, in this particular setting, under the organization of three white  "Roles given to  people of colour  are always background,  always menial."  men—this forum was even happening and  why she was a part of it. Todd observed that  the dominant culture chooses when to acknowledge the existence of people of colour.  "I think the whole issue of putting ourselves  in the service of the dominant culture is a  crucial one," Todd said. The issue is people  of colour exist whether or not the dominant  culture wants to see them.  Zainub Verjee, co-founder of In Visible Colours, a women of colour and Third  World women film and video festival, carried Todd's sentiments into her talk on  the topics of ethnicity and multiculturalism. Verjee's focus was on the media and  the influence of "western" technological,  economic and pohtical ventures into Third  World media groups. "Economic structures  determine the cultural and artistic character of both international and indigenous media. The Third World artist has been bound  by economic exclusion and cultural appropriation."  tic pohcy." Verjee also focused on the concepts of visible minority, the other, and multiculturalism. "The concept of multiculturalism," said Verjee, "was adopted in the 60's  and embodied as official government pohcy  in the early 70's in reaction to the particular  perceived shift in the range of races and immigrants who have come to Canada in the  last 40 years."  Verjee views "multiculturalism" as a vehicle which: "effectively separate(s) dominant culture from these cultures, situating themselves as 'the other'." Verjee then  traced the origins of "ethnics" which "came  to be used in the United States as what was  described in 1961 as a pohte term for Jews,  Italians and other lesser breeds."  Verjee pinpointed the meaning of "multiculturalism" with a quote from Richard  Fung's essay in the catalogue which accompanied the Asian-Canadian multi-media exhibit, YeUow PerU Reconsidered: "Multiculturalism shifts the focus away from the  poUtical and social questions of race such  as housing, employment, education, access  to power, into marketing of personal identity. It champions the notion of cultural difference in which people are encouraged to  preserve cultural forms of song and dance  they didn't practice before they came to  Canada."  Lies and Labels: A Forum on Race and  Ethnicity in the Performing Arts was typical of the many forums that have surfaced surrounding the issue of race relations  in North America. As Zainub Verjee concluded that evening: "the questions of race  are complex and the answers are not absolute ... a side of pohtical contention is  cultural—at times seemingly quiet, at times  destructive, but it is always changing."

SSKSS*SSSS*SKS*SSS*SSSSSSK^  Folk Music Festival:  ARTS  Women performers  from all over the map  by Kinesis Writer  Amidst an almost bewUdering variety of  musical tastes at this year's fourteenth annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival, you'U  find some women who span a number of  performance mediums. Combining the best  traditions of poetry and music, of uncompromising poUtical activism and wry humour, these performers give their messages  of women's experiences a multi-layered musical expression.  LiUian AUen and Revolutionary Tea  Party are part of the cutting edge of this  new creative interaction between the spoken word and the emotive power of music.  A poet and long-time poUtical activist in  Toronto, Allen's work focuses on giving a  shape and voice to the voiceless. Woven into  the words is an "exceptionally hot" accompaniment of reggae, rock, world music, funk  and rap dehvered by the Revolutionary Tea  Party band.  As a Native story-teUer, Lee Maracle is  weU-known for her work in bridging the gap  between the traditions of Native oratory  and the Euro-Canadian short story form.  Her stories speak to the struggle of being  Native: exploring themes of survival and defeat, acceptance and rejection, struggle and  reconciliation. At the festival she'U be com  bining her talents with daughters and drummers Columpa Bobb and Tania Carter to  bring these words and rhythms together.  Four folkies with a gift for that certain  turn of phrase are performing solo at the  festival, but toured together recently in Life  According to Four Bitchin' Babes. Sally  Fingerett, Patty Larkin, Christine Lavin  and Megon McDonough blend wit and heart  in equal measure with acoustic virtuosity.  Larkin's and Lavin's lampoons of such 90's  phenomena as "Prisoners of Their Hairdos"  and "Sensitive New Age Guys" are worth a  chuckle whUe Megon McDonough and Sally  Fingerett take a more poignant look at acceptance, rejection and dreams.  Rounding out the hghter side of things  wUl be a trio of British feminist comedy  performers, Alex Dallas, Alison Field and  Wendy Vousden, collectively known as Sensible Footwear. Described as "fierce, funny  and feminist" their humour is inspired by  the mundane realities of women's everyday  hves.  In the old timey stringband tradition, the  Heartbeats from New York, take the passion  of the Appalachian fiddle, banjo, accordion,  guitar and bass and translate it into their  own updated mountain style of music. By  aU accounts the music is fast, furious and  eminently danceable.  Toronto playwright, songwriter and blues/jazz performer Diana Braithwaite brings  her insights into the experience of urban  Black Canadians.  Other featured Canadian performers are  Four the Moment, a Halifax-based a cappella quartet rooted in the women's and  Black communities, and Anne Lederman, a  solo fiddler and composer working in a variety of traditions. As weU, Kathleen Year-  wood and her band Cheval de Guerre wUl  debut at the Vancouver Festival. Yearwood  is regarded as a remarkable and original  artist.  True to the folk fest traditions of music from "aU over the map", this year's  hst of performers includes Altazor, a Latin  American folk group of four women with  roots in Cuba, Chile, Venezuela and the  United States. Iva Bittova from Czechoslovakia sings and plays viohn in an eclectic mixture of Eastern European traditions.  Two Vietnamese performers, Ngoc and Qi  Lam, wUl be appearing as part of the Henry  Kaiser Acoustic Group. The mother and  daughter duo play the dan tranh, a sixteen-  string zither-like instrument dating back to  the 13th century in Vietnam.  For more information on these artists  or the many others appearing July 19,  20 and 21 at Jericho Beach, contact the  Vancouver Folk Music Festival, 3271  Main St., 879-2931.  Lesbian and gay choir fulfilling and fun  by Juline Macdonnell  The first opportunity to hear the new  Vancouver Lesbian and Gay Choir (VLGC)  came in June at a Sunday evening seU-out  concert enjoyed by performers and audience  alike. Born out of the Celebration '90 International Festival Chorus (the Vancouver  Gay Games) last summer, VLGC now has  a membership of 60 lesbians, gay men and  straight women.  To an enthusiastic crowd, VLGC sang  opera, pop, Canadian folk tunes and renaissance choral works. No matter what the  tradition, the choir displayed a tightness of  style and a true enjoyment of music. From  the beginning, the atmosphere was one of  celebration. Both choir and audience eas-  Uy moved from funny love songs specially  arranged for the choir (the women dehvered "Gonna Get Along Without Ya Now")  to classical pieces such as "Va, Pensiero"  by Verdi, and "Nessun Dorma" by Puccini.  I particularly enjoyed "Donkey Riding," a  traditional folk song which the choir apparently loves to hate.  A special guest set by the four-women  a cappella group Aya rounded out the  evening, which closed with the audience giving VLGC an enthusiastic standing ovation.  I found the concert to be musically and  pohticaUy inspiring, and women I talked  with after the concert said they too felt empowered.  VLGC is the newest member of GALA—  the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses—an information clearinghouse for 90  choirs across Canada, the US, England and  Germany. Like other GALA choirs, VLGC  is not only committed to enjoyment and  exceUence in music, but to the behef that  lesbian/gay visibUity "strengthens aU of us  and fosters understanding among people."  Carole Inson, a soprano in the choir,  joined after she saw the Gay Games choir.  Her enjoyment goes beyond the music. Said  Inson "I'm in the process of coming out and  what better a way?"  Alto Bev Bradshaw said that the choir  purposely chose to have lesbian and gay in  their name because they "wanted to be out  and visible. Our intention is to raise the pro  files of gays and lesbians positively ... and  the purpose of our music is to inspire action."  Bradshaw also said that it was enjoyable  to be around the men in the choir. "In most  situations, women need to work separately  from men for pohtical change. In this case,  we choose to work with men."  The choir's repertoire is selected by committee and any words which are sexist or  homophobic are changed.  VLGC has a goal of perfection and offers  musical training at sectional practices and  with music director Michael Grice. While  the members need not have previous choral  experience, the choir is composed of good  singers—singers that are able to carry a  tune and hold their part whUe another part  is sung. Bradshaw points out that as long  someone has these basic qualities, it is only  a matter of practice before their voices "wUl  contribute to the choir."  The choir is taking a break this summer  and when they resume practice in September, they'll be looking for new members—  particularly women. Bev Bradshaw says  that "as weU as being hard work, [the choir]  is also stimulating and fun ... it's fulfilling  to work in the choir."  For information about VLGC, please  call Liz Landon at 732-1402. If you  would like to meet the choir before  September, there will be a social on Saturday, July 13th at 8569 Osier Street.  For more information on the social,  please call Carillee at 732-1773.  Juline Macdonnell is currently an exploited worker at Census Canada.  1988 W 4th & Maple  Vancouver, B.C.

Still from 'What do Pop Art, Pop Music, Pornography and Politics Have to do with Real Life?"  by Kathy March  In concert with the Out On Screen  Gay and Lesbian film festival in Vancouver, Video In presented two evenings of  videos. The social environment created by  the screenings—fuU house both evenings-  was perhaps as significant and creative a  comment on the issue of lesbian representation as some of the video work itself. Lesbians took fuU advantage of the opportunity to satisfy the very real need to come  out and see themselves acting with power  in the company of an audience and as reflected on the smaU screen.  This participation is not to be taken for  granted. The program notes for Out On  Video explained: "One of the main areas  of attack by the government at this time is  in the area of gay and lesbian expression.  Because we beheve that lesbians and gays  need to produce and distribute their own  art, documentaries, pornography and dramas, and knowing that in doing so many  have faced criminal prosecution at the municipal, provincial and national levels, we  [Video In] have maintained a hard hne in  opposition to any form of government control ... While exemptions do work for some  high profile events, individual artists and  producers, the most vulnerable works (sexually explicit and pohtical work) are stiU  threatened and removed quietly from pubhc view."  The ease and comfort with which lesbians  were able to enjoy this event does not deny  the threat of censorship, whose weight is  brought home to any lesbian reflecting on  what is, for many, a painful coming-out pro-  nan t representations of who exists and who  is credible. While broadcast television ordains, constructs and disseminates models  of "authentic" hfestyle, the viewer of the  Out On Video screening came to appreciate the video artist subversively taking over  the territory of the TV set.

The first step in assuming lesbian identity is often the casting off of societal and  self-censorship.  One of the most potent statements these  lesbian videos make is the simple fact that  they appear on a TV set, the most pervasive and influential device of mainstream  mass media. In doing so, these videos document the absence of lesbians in the domi-  up with the perplexing question "What is  lesbian video?" Is lesbian work only recognized when it speaks specificaUy of lesbianism and/or is made by lesbians? What of the  lesbian video artist whose work does not directly address her sexual identity?

Other images/narratives reflected much more than  issues about sexuahty, giving lesbians and  ...Coming out on screen  by Ginger Plumb  The 1991 Out On Screen Lesbian and  Gay Film Festival in Vancouver started on  a sour note for me as weU as a lot of  other lesbians I know. The problem? A  fundraiser for the festival's lesbian programming featuring—Chopperchicks in Zombie Town.  It was exciting seeing the posters for  the benefit: a "women-only" screening of a  "dykes on bikes" movie. Wrong. The film  was a B-movie horror story by a man. Fortunately, the sex scenes were aU lumped  together; unfortunately, they were aU heterosexual. Fortunately, the chopperchicks  leader was a dyke; unfortunately, she's bitter, a bitch and she never gets laid. Fortunately, none of the biker gang opts to stay  in the dreary town where the "plot" takes  place; unfortunately, the hottest butch-  dyke-potential in the whole movie lets some  dweeb get on her bike with her before the  gang blows smoke into the sunset.  Entertaining? That's a matter of opinion. In my opinion it was inappropriate as  a fundraising draw for this festival.  But my real disappointment came not  from the poor choice of movie, but from  the poor choice of poUtics presented before  the show. I sat in shock as a woman from  the festival's board of directors told the aU-  women audience that it was going against  the pohtics of the Out On Screen Film Festival Society to hold a women-only event. I  felt insulted and used when her speech had  ended. If I hadn't been asked to review some  of the festival's films, I wouldn't have attended any more screenings. I think the lesbian community is due an apology by the  festival committee in a big way.  This feehng was reinforced when I spent  Friday night, the one and only night the lo  cal bar is women-only, watching the bulk of  lesbian programming at the festival. Poor  pohtics meets poor judgement.  I was happy to see that S/M imagery  was presented in Nancy's Nightmare  [see video review] at the festival. I question, however, the underlying assumption  that showing it at midnight would attract  the "sexuaUy diverse", or the politicaUy-  motivated fear  that  we can  only show  See SCREEN page 18  gays a vision of themselves in multiplicity,  diversity and individuahty. As lesbians, we  do not enter into the challenges of our sexual orientation hfestyle solely through the  dimension of sexuaUty—our ethnicity and  creativity are also intersected.  Out On Video was a marathon event with  very httle sexuaUy explicit material. Unfortunately, three hours of work per evening  was screened: by many accounts, a difficult  stretch for the audience to remain active  viewers. Notwithstanding the discomfort of  the screening, it was heartening to know  there is a substantial body of work being  produced by lesbians. The foUowing is a review of the video art that provoked a response from me. I look forward to the point  in time when I wUl turn on the TV in the  comfort of my home, and enjoy this kind of  work, as part of regular broadcast programming:  Laura, Ingrid, and Rebecca: A "talking  head" interview, produced by a man, with  three young, animated lesbians who speak  of their participation in ACT-UP. They discuss how their pro-choice pohtical agenda  is located within AIDS activism: central  to both issues is control over the physical body and access to medical care. These  women also discussed their frustration with  how the gay men in their chapter of ACT-  UP marginalize women's issues. (Phillipe  Rouge—USA, Frameline, 1990).  Laws and Skin: Images of the colour and  pageantry of the BrazUian carnival, an event  where prohibitions against the body are  suspended: female body buUders, dykes on  bikes, leather queens and transvestites with  equal legitimacy take up space in the pubUc domain and parade their bodies outside the constraints of gender. (Christine  Martin—Canada, Videographic, 1990).  Malaysian Series # 2: For two and a  half minutes, we watch an Asian woman in  leather jacket and sarong whipping a toaster  oven. Without sound or text to instruct the  viewer, the image is left open to interpretation. (Azian Nurudin—USA, Frameline,  1986-87).  Nancy's Nightmare: A lesbian S&M dungeon scene with Nancy Sinatra's "These  boots are made for walking" as sound track.  In this video, whips and leather are neither  provocative or passionate. The actors are  staged and static, and the action needlessly  repetitive. The shot of the boot stomping  the Nancy Sinatra record got laughs from  the audience. Despite its shortcomings, this  video does aUow us to acknowledge an often contentious version of lesbian sexuality. (Azian Nurudin—USA, Framehne,  1988).

Livesay has written over 25 books  of poetry and prose and has received numerous awards, including being named an Officer of the Order of Canada as weU as being awarded the Governor General's Award  for poetry twice. At 82, Livesay is certainly  weU-established in the Canadian hterary  But Livesay's memoir is not only of interest in relation to her hterary achievements.  Livesay was also a weU-known femimst and  sociahst. This book covers her experiences  as she hves and works in places as varied  as Canada, the US, France, England and  Zambia. It describes her activities as a feminist and sociahst as weU as her work as a  teacher, writer and social worker.  Through this memoir, one becomes not  only acquainted with but also attached to  Livesay's mother, father, friends and lovers.  The threads of these various relationships  are traced and interwoven so skiUfuUy that  the reader is continually interested and involved in the story.  Journey should be of particular interest to femimsts. Livesay's memoir gives one  an interesting perspective on the first two-  thirds of this century. In recounting her own  reactions and those of others to racism, sexism and lesbianism, she reminds us how far  we have come, and how far we have yet to  go-  It is somewhat ironic that in the "After Words" Livesay notes that she has  not "dwelt on problems relating to being  a woman." While the book does not develop theories of feminism or discuss how  Livesay's struggles are many women's struggles and the story of Livesay's hfe is at least  in part a story about the problems relating  to being a woman. For example, she relates  how after finding meaning in her work for  many years, she was forced to quit her job  as a social worker in order to marry. At the  time it was Ulegal for a married woman to  be employed in the professions of teaching,  nursing or social work. Not surprisingly, she  Dorothy Livesay, 1950.  was deeply depressed by the sudden change  in her hfe.  For Livesay, the search for truth is obviously an important theme in her hfe, and  one that she inherited from her father. However, I found the interrelationship between  music, dancing and poetry, another important theme in this book, much more interesting. Livesay describes an increasing appreciation for music throughout her hfe. At  14 she writes that "music and poetry are  one." She describes how a keener appreciation for music "strengthened her feeling for  rhythm in poetry" during her years as a  university student. She also notes, however,  that this new appreciation did nothing to  "change my stiff, uncoordinated body movements. I remained too self-conscious to let  go and dance. Instead, the words did that."  It is not untU she is hving in Africa in the  early sixties that she can wholly accept music into her hfe.  Although the book succeeds in keeping  one engaged through the two-hundred and  some pages, it does seem to end rather  abruptly. This may reflect the fact that  the author chose not to chronicle the years  after 1963 because it would involve writing about people who were stiU alive and  therefore vulnerable. However, the "After  Words" does lend the book a sense of c  pletion that somewhat compensates for the  sudden traiUng off of the story.  Read this book. Its virtues far outweigh  its weaknesses.

Now, for the reviews:  Nocturne—directed by Joy Chamberlain, Great Britain, 1990. 16mm. "Upper class, 45-year old Marguerite returns to  the family mansion after her mother's death  where she is haunted by flashbacks of her  impoverished chUdhood. But she isn't ready  for a surprise encounter with two delinquent  lesbian hitchhikers."  This exceUent short feature was packed  with sexual nuances of every kind. Is it a  story about a poor Uttle rich girl grown up?  Is it about her mourning her dead mother?  Is it about her mourning the loss of her cherished chUdhood nanny? Is it about classism,  racism or homophobia in Great Britain? Or  is it a coming-out story?  Nocturne is somehow an erotic tale that  combines aU of the above ingredients to produce a thriUing, sometimes disturbing, psychological look at a chUdhood obsession and  the limitations dictated by mother, caste  and ultimately sell  The outrageous, cocky Cockney lesbians  are wonderful and full. They "play" with  the self-pity of the rich woman, but never relinquish their own power to her. They never  hold her hand, they never guide her and  they never do it for her (literally).

The characters  are weU-developed and strong, and make for  a movie worth seeing twice.  Her Giveaway: A Spiritual Journey  With AIDS— directed by Mona Smith,  USA, 1987. Video. Her Giveaway is the  gift of Carol Lafavor, an Ojibway, activist  and lesbian mother hving with AIDS. The  video deals with practical information on  needle use, sex and safety. It also dispels  myths and misconceptions and generalizations about Native peoples, especially in regards to drug use and sexuaUty. Her Giveaway is a celebration of Lafavor coming  to terms with AIDS by combining her traditional beUefs and healing practices with  Western medicine. To viewers, it is an affirmation of hope and caring. It is also an inspiring example of how we can aU learn from  the Native American phUosophy of Ulness.  The only criticism I have of Her Giveaway was the lack of information about  safe-sex practices for lesbians. ExceUent  video, heart-warming, worth seeing.  State of Mind—directed by Angie Black,  Australia, 1990. 16mm. Wierd, eerie,  psychologicaUy thriUing, aU describe Angie  Black's State Of Mind. Based on an S/M  relationship and the power dynamics between two lovers, this movie deals with  one woman's state of mind after her lover's  death. Did the woman commit suicide, leaving Jessie to deal with her own guilt? Or  did Jessie really kill her lover, accidentally  or otherwise?  In any case, the demons that haunt Jessie  are her own, and she deals with them her  own way. The relationship wasn't over for  Jessie yet: she had to end it in her mind.

Images 91: Festival of Independent Film  and Video had its fourth successful run in  Toronto, June 6-11.  The festival received Telefilm funding for  the first time in its four year history as an  alternative festival. The program included  work ranging from experimental to straight-  up documentary. Altogether, 71 independent films and videos were featured from  Canada, the United States, England, Cuba,  Australia and ChUe. The Gulf War, national identity, sexuaUty, racism and feminism were aU on the menu.  Panels and workshops mirrored the program and provided for some provocative  thought and dialogue, which continued in  outdoor cafes late into Toronto's warm and  muggy nights. Definitely a time for important exchanges and debates.  Also, this year's festival took the work to  people outside of the festival circuit, by organizing a series of screenings in the Arabic,  Latin American, Black and Native communities. This SateUite project was very successful in reaching an audience that would  not normally attend an independent festival.  Claude Forget programmed interesting  and sensitive work which included Mai  Masri's Children of Fire, a work on the  chUdren of the Intifada; Let's Rap by Alison Burns produced as part of the National  Film Board's Five Feminist Minutes; and  Maigre Dog by Donna James.  I curated a two-part program, Media Mirage, focussing on independent and community-based works deconstructing West  ern dominant media's images of the Middle  East, Arab people and the Gulf War. Included in the program were two documentaries by women, which focus on the occupied territories of Palestine and women's  role in the struggle. I was thankful that the  organizers of Images published my portion  of the festival catalogue in Arabic as weU as  EngUsh and French.  Experimental film and video art—didactic or not—are centred in the independent  scene.

I would have preferred  more length, though.  TRACES  directed by Juha Browne Figuereo  Canada: 1990, Film.  In two minutes, the filmmaker explores  her African heritage with fast-moving images and traditional rhythms. Using clothing and fashion as the metaphor for cultural identity she travels to ancestral homelands and back, examining her personal denial and own identity.  KINESIS.,,,,. Letters  Since lesbianism  and feminism are  not synonymous...  Kinesis:  Since lesbianism and feminism are not  synonymous, I am wondering why Kinesis  is so biased toward lesbianism? I'm not just  referring to the "Sexplorations" section in  the June issue (though five full pages of coverage of lesbian sexuahty does seem a bit  much, and I doubt that Kinesis would be  prepared to devote that much space to the  joys of married sex); I'm talking about the  paper's general slant.  For example, on page 15 of the June issue  artist Persimmon Blackbridge is identified  boastfuUy as "an open lesbian." Why is this  relevant? Is her sexual preference somehow  related to her talent? Is it more noteworthy for a lesbian to receive the Visual Arts  award than it would be for a non-lesbian to  do so? By contrast, on page 16 no reference  is made to the sexual orientation of musician Anita Sleeman (though one suspects,  on the basis of her husband and six chUdren, that she is probably "an open heterosexual").  I am in complete sympathy with the  needs and rights of lesbians, but being a  lesbian is certainly no guarantee of being a  feminist, and I think Kinesis shows disrespect for women in general by being so partisan. I beheve that the Status of Women's  newspaper should inform the entire femimst  spectrum and should endeavour to inspire  aU women toward taking action every day,  in some way, in their own Uves.  For myself, I would be interested in reading more analysis of old and new feminist  books in Kinesis. I'd hke to see more discussion of the legal issues—what specific  legislation is pending or needed. I'd also Uke  to see more expUcit encouragement for specific actions which the ordinary woman can  take, such as letter-writing on a particular  issue, or boycotting the products of sexist  firms, or raising current feminist issues with  other groups to which they may belong.  How about a "hot issues" section in Kinesis, in which one current issue could be  thoroughly covered each time? How about a  "scoreboard", to keep us abreast of progress  in Canada and elsewhere in such areas as  abortion, chUd care, chUd support, pensions, wage parity, nonsexist language, and  equal access to health care, education and  employment?  Farhat Khan wrote in the June issue of  Kinesis, "One of the integral problems in-  ._   FOR  Feminist  THE0RY&  LITERATURE  _parTacus  rB00KS  311 W. HASTINGS ST.

I beUeve that Kinesis could  provide much better support and guidance  for a much larger group of women, if it re-  focussed from lesbianism to feminism.

Classism a  serious problem  at Kinesis  Kinesis:  As community/cultural organizers, we're  exhausted and overwhelmed by seeing our  efforts shat on by those that could/should  be potential aUies. We hearken back to the  review in AprU's Kinesis about the BOA  cultural events/show: Wimmin Surviving  Oppression. The review stank—not because  it didn't say that we are unconditionally  wonderful, but because it patronized and  classified aU of the women who participated,  and totaUy misrepresented the content and  intent of the show and events.  Wimmin worked really hard to puU together a massive cultural event including artworks in the Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre, the FirehaU Arts Centre,  two performance evenings and two video  evening. Nobody got any money for anything, though the rewards were great.  It was an overwhelming success according  to wimmin who participated and other reviews in the Sun and West/East Ender.  Wimmin of aU ages, cultural backgrounds  and diversities came together in response to  the one thing we have in common—because  of our gender oppression.  BOA, a loose coUective of wimmin, creates spaces with wimmin with no or httle  access to resources, (ie. bucks,) to speak in  our own voices, without censor/editing. We  do this by publishing a magazine, organizing  cultural events, and have published some  theoretical pamphlets; again, out of our own  limited pockets. BOA's process is inclusive;  wimmin participate in aU levels of production no matter what the level of experience.  We try to include, not exclude. We have  aU felt what it is Uke to be discriminated  against. We know what it is hke to be  treated by people with some power and  privUege hke we are somehow inferior and of  httle value. We know that this is classism.  Inadvertently, Morgan McGuigan's review raised the issue of classism in the feminist community at large, and in the feminist  presses in particular. The review itself was  classist, but so was the whole treatment and  process BOA wimmin have endured since  engaging in this dialogue with Kinesis.  Three BOA wimmin coUectively responded to the review within the context  of an article about BOA for June's Kinesis. CoUective process takes time but is always three times as powerful. We were told  by Kinesis that it is not standard to respond to reviews in articles. Whose standards? The patriarchal presses? Since when  is BOA "standard" anything except in respecting the rights of wimmin to speak,  think, and act for ourselves—and not by  some privUeged Other's standards? BOA is  creating new ways of exploring and expressing as we go. Our coUective process got in  the way of Kinesis' editorial standards, so  we had to puU the article ...  A classism caucus at Kinesis might address this issue, but we fear that a caucus would not impact on the roots of the  problem: hegemony at the local femimst  press by middle class femimst values. Real  changes require sharing of power and privUege, a process that those that hold it wUl  inevitably resist. In our experience, Kinesis  is virtuaUy synonymous with whomever the  editor is at the time. The editor is the only  person that writers have contact with. This  is part of the problem of structural hegemony and we cannot name the issue without naming how it is manifested. The relationship of editor to writer is important because the editor has the power to publish or  not to publish in a newspaper that is read  and respected by many women. The writer's  only access to that audience is through the  editor.  Obviously, there is a power imbalance  buUt into the relationship of writer/editor.  To abuse the balance of power is to use a  position of privUege as power-over. This too  is classism.  Continued maltreatment of wimmin—  instead of encouragement, discussion, sharing of power and genuine dignity and respect for others—wUl continue to alienate  wimmin from Kinesis who have httle access to resources. It wiU alienate wimmin  who don't have the practiced analysis or  classist debating skiUs required to engage  with an editor ... It alienates wimmin  who have different ways of articulating—  wimmin who are healing, exploring, changing, stretching, and trying on new sldUs.  We want the community to know that  classism is a serious  problem at Kine-  iC^tU Do typos turn you into  a raging monster?  There is a vocation for  you - proofreading  Kinesis.  Please call  sis—which is a respected newspaper by  many women. These are serious aUegations,  and we expect them to be dealt with, not  treated with more disdain and defensiveness. IronicaUy, BOA magazine started in  part five years ago because of similar experiences with Kinesis back then. Kinesis didn't represent us. We wanted to create  a space where women could speak without  the demeaning process of having our work  slashed beyond recognition, (some call editing,) with the strong implication that you  are stupid and inferior heaped on top of it.  Classism sUences us.  We agonized about naming this issue—  wUl it be divisive? The divisions of class already exist. What is done about them is  up to those who most benefit by the clasi  structure. The rest of us are busy combatting those divisions every day. Classism and  powertripping by making some wimmin feel  less powerful than others are not temporary  or idiosyncratic to Kinesis. On the i  trary, classism is a necessary condition of a  neo-class of women that we see growing out  of middle class feminism: the hberated over-  BOA is one of the ways we  oppression, even oppression within the  women's movement. If wimmin continue to  oppress each other, it hinders our fight  against the true enemy: patriarchy. We want  to buUd a women's movement that embraces aU of our diversities. We are trying  to create a world for and by wimmin where  we don't have to hve under economic and/or  violent constraints. To do this, we have to  stop classism.  Sincerely,  pj flaming, kim jackson  Members of BOA  Vancouver, BC  The Editorial Board responds:  Kinesis was asked by BOA to review  their art show, Wimmin Surviving Oppression. BOA was unhappy with the  review (the reviewer had given them a  copy) and asked us to pull it. We refused. BOA then asked for a page in Kinesis to write about themselves, and we  agreed to this.  BOA said they would not be responding to the review in their article and we  told them this was just as well: a  sponse to a review belongs in a letter to  the editor.  BOA submitted an article which had  several pages of personal attacks on the  reviewer. We told them we would edit  out that part, so they re-submitted the  article with changes. This article was  typeset (unedited) and laid out. Two  days before Kinesis went to press, a BOA  member pulled the article saying she  was unhappy with it.  The Kinesis Editorial Board is concerned about BOA's criticisms and has  asked to meet with them. The above letter was edited to remove personal attacks.  JANET LICHTY  3 PSYCHOLOGY  14 - 3615 W.
