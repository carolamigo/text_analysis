 Kinesis  vol 6 no 9  ((^   SEP Ok: 1977      J  Vancouver status of women  at VS>^       kjnesis means change July 24:  FEMINISTS FIGHT BILL- 65  On Sunday, July 24, more than 2,000  people marched in protest against  Bill 65. Bill 65 will dismantle the  Vancouver Resources Board. It will  recentralize power in Victoria and  end the collective agreements of  VRB employees.  Scores of Vancouver  citizens have recognized that this  is a dangerous piece of legislation, and community groups and unions  throughout Vancouver make July 24  a day of united protest.  The women's movement has been working actively throughout this issue.  Representatives from twenty two  women's groups marched, and the  protest has the official support  of the British Columbia Federation  of Women, a province-wide organization with more than fifty member groups.  Sue Moore, Action Organizer of B.C.  F.W. addressed the rally at the  Orpheum which followed the march.  Her speech placed the issue of Bill  65 within a feminist perspective.  We had hoped that other speakers  would place the issue within the  broader, economic, perspective of  Provincial/Federal cutbacks which  attack low-income people (for  example, the AIB rollbacks and  the extended waiting period for  UIC eligibility). We had also hoped  that Bill 65 would be linked to  other re-centralization moves by  the Social Credit government (for  example, the introduction of the  CORE curriculum).  Sue Moore spoke to the feminist issue  of how Bill 65 will undermine the  already precarious position of single parent families. She spoke from  the position of a 'consumer' of the >  services which will be axed.  ^\0^  C-TT.  Vander Zalm had predicted that there  would be no clients at the rally.  He was grossly mistaken.  She spoke in support of a group wnrLch  the Human Resources Minister knows  very little about. This group comprises 85% of those receiving social  services - women. Vander Zalm knows  little about those who live below  the poverty line in the late seventies. He knows nothing about what it  is like to be a single mother.  When the women's movement has raised  its issues with the Minister: the  right to control our own bodies, the  right to a non-sexist education, the  right to 24 hour quality childcare,  his response has been: "Women make  the best cooks and housekeepers and  should be encouraged in that role."  "When I was on social assistance",  said Moore, "I was lucky, because I  had free care for my children. That  gave me the time to look for a job.  I looked hard. I went to the Manpower Office daily, only to be disappointed time and time again. There  were no jobs available that provided a living wage; there were no  jobs at all."

Sue Moore said:"...the Social Credit  millionaire mouthpieces...do not have  a future of social assistance, a future of working for a minimum wage,  a future of not knowing where their  children are because child care is  either not available or is too expensive to use."  The Vancouver Resouces Board alone  has recognized some of the special  needs of women today. The VRB has  provided money for essential services such as out-of-school childcare centres, youth workers, neighborhood houses and transition  houses. All of these services add  up to make life a little more  tolerable. This is why, Sue Moore  concluded, the B.C.F.W. opposes  the abolition of the VRE. It demands  that the Vancouver Resources Board  not only be preserved but that  community resouce boards be re-instated throughout the province.  VRB-a Feminist Issue  Fighting Bill 65 is not an issue in  which the women's movement is taking  part because we \\rant to help fight  an admirable cause. Fighting Bill  65 is a feminist issue. Vie  have  seen the way in which the rulers of  this country act to preserve their  self-interest when economic crises  occur. When unemployment rises,  they make it more difficult to receive unemployment benefits. When  there are not enough jobs to go  round, they keep women in the home  by denying us chidcare.

To the Status of Women:  You say you desire emancipation for  all women and all you are succeeding  in doing is attracting more revulsion,  and disregard, and causing women to  lose more and more of their freedom  and rights.  I am not saying that you are whores,  sluts or chippeys, but let's be honest, do you not think that you are  giving that Impression to large numbers of people, including men?  Apparently you are interested only  in yourselves because you only print  in Kinesis what suits you or favours  you and you never answer your mail  though you have given 3'ourselves a  fairly large salary. Do you think  that your hypocrisy goes without  being noticed by the majority of women, and other people?  Stop making up false propaganda and  blaming innocent Grey Nuns and other  Catholic institutions.  If anyone  has helped the sick and the poor and  encouraged decent life styles they  sure have. Perhaps their approach is  sometimes not what we would like but  at least their heart and effort is  in the right place and most unselfish.  Can you say that for yourselves?  I suppose this will be treated with  indifference again or thrown in the  waste paper basket which just proves  once again that you are worse and more  phony than The Capitalists and, God  Knows, they are bad enough!  Amy Pollen  Sisters:  I am the rural organizer for the B.C.  Federation of Women, an organization  representing over forty women's  groups in B.C. As my position on  standing committee of B.C.F.W. is  responsible for voicing the needs of  rural women, I am asking for your  cooperation.  I NEED to communicate  with as many rural women as possible.  I am especially interested in hearing  from women in extremely isolated living conditions, as these women often  experience severe isolation from  their sisters.  Please don't think that you have  nothing to say.  If you could express some ideas on the following  questions, I would very much appreciate your time and effort. Your contribution will help me represent you  and your needs to all B.C.F.W. member  groups throughout the province of B.C.  What are the problems of rural living?  Is the isolation a severe problem to  you? What facilities does your community have for health care? What  kinds of employment are there for  women in your area?  These are just a few questions  I would like some feedback on.  Your joys/fears are important and  need expression.  B.C.F.W. cares  and wants to represent you as well  as possible. Please write me as  soon as possible.  Emily Carter  Rural Organizer, BCFW  MORE LETTERS ON PAGE 22  W__W- ■ fv^b  i  1 "!■  |a|  l^il1TM  AN OPEN LETTER TO THE WOMEN'S GROUPS  OF B.C. FROM THE STANDING COMMITTEE  OF THE B.C. FEDERATION OF WOMEN  Over the past several months, some  women's centres have been advised by  field officers of the Secretary of  State to approach the B.C.F.W. for  money for their centres. This action  by field officers is reprehensible.  It serves the function of dividing  the women's movement.  The women's movement in Canada and  B.C. in particular is being divided  continually by government agencies  which fund some groups and not others.  Because we expend much time and  energy seeking funding, this diverts  our energies from activities demanding change. It is bad enough that  much of our efforts are directed  into funding, but when we have to  explain to member groups why we  don't have money to give to them,  the situation becomes impossible.  If one stops and examinees this issue,  the ramifications are overwhelming.  If the B.C.F.W. Standing Committee  decided to fund a certain group  in a region, and then couldn't fund  a group either in another region  or the same region, the hostility  and angry feelings created by such  a potential situation would render  us useless. We cannot afford to pay  such a price.  Another aspect of this practice by  the Secretary of State is that it  implies the priorities the funded  groups have set for their funding  is inadequate. By suggesting to a  group looking for money that they  should ask B.C.F.W, it appears that  B.C.F.W.'s role is to fund women's  groups. This creates confusion.  We must discuss and analyze how the  government divides us with funding,  how they interfere with the operation of groups, the way they  continually tell us what issues are  important and need funding. The  concept of B.C.F.W;s being responsible for funding activities of  centres is contrary to the feminist principles of collectivity,  which we attempt to work from.  B.C.F.W. and the Standing Committee  continues to struggle with the problems of isolation, urban/rural  differences, geographical barriers,  personal and political differences.  We must develop a strong feminist  analysis concerning the nature of  funding. We must continue to build  a strong movement without being  rendered useless by the string  attached to government funding.  Susan Sanderson  Co-ordinator, B.C.F.W. -Ujluju  INACTION AT CITY HALL  In July 1975, Vancouver City Council  unanimously passed a motion striking  a special committee to design and  oversee an Equal Employment Opportunity Committee for the City of  Vancouver, targeting the women,  racial minorities and physically  handicapped employees.  A Committee was appointed by Mayor  Art Phillips with representatives  from Council, civic management, city  unions, community groups, and the  Human Rights Branch. Work began in  September of 1975, and was concluded  this spring and summer with the assistance of $5,000 from the Secretary of State Department.  The Committee has presented City  Hall with a comprehensive analysis  of the composition of the present  City workforce by sex, by race and  by physical handicap.  The report comments: "The results  of our data collection do not lead  us to conclude that the City of  Vancouver practises overt discrimination. However, the different  patterns of employment and compensation of women, racial minorities,  and the physically handicapped do  indicate the existence of barriers  to equal opportunity.  "Women, racial minorities, and the  physically handicapped are not represented proportionately in all job  classifications and at all levels,  and in general, they receive less  pay.  This does not mean that the  City of Vancouver's employment practices are in any way out of the ordinary.  In fact, in every sense,  the City of Vancouver follows the  larger Canadian pattern."  From these facts - the lack of proportionate representation, and the  wage differential, the report draws  two basic conclusions:  1. The City of Vancouver must take  action to help solve these discrepancies and to give its employees  fair treatment and to improve its  overall use of human resources;  2. Because such action involves  many specific steps and interlocking projects, the City of Vancouver  should undertake a long-term, comprehensive equal opportunity program.  The City should therefore a) implement an Equal Opportunity Program  to phase in the recommended changes  over a three-year period; b) assign  responsibility for the EEO program  to the City Manager; c) create an  Office of Equal Opportunity with the  authority to implement the program.  With regard to women, the report  recommends that:  The City should  review and revise all recruitment  and selection procedures, and job  requirements, to remove discriminatory effects.  It should develop  training programs, goals and timetables for implementation, career  ladders, new training programs for  women, and "bridge positions" between support and administrative  and technical positions.  It should  provide career counselling to women  employees, review pay levels and  fringe benefits.  How do employment patterns break  down? The picture is exactly what  you'd expect to find:  Men are 70% of civic employees -  (4,735)  Women are 37.5% of civic employees  - (1,999)  74% of the women who work for the  City are in the female job ghettos - they are secretaries, nurses  or librarians.  90% of the traditionally male positions - police officers, parks  workers, firefighters and engineering workers are men.  At the top of the ladder, the position is likewise familiar:  Men fill 82% of the management positions.  Women fill 18%.  Of the 35 women in management, 22  are branch librarians with the  Vancouver Public Library (at the  top of the female job ghetto,  that is).  11 out of 17 departments have no  women managers.  Women's median salary is 64% of  men's.  Finally - only 6 out of 19 members  of the Equal Employment Opportunity Committee are women.  Although women are 29% of civic  employees, they are 51% of the  population and 37.5% of the B.C.  labour force.  FEMINISTS  ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 9, CITY COUNCIL  WILL DISCUSS WHAT TO DO NEXT ABOUT  THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY  ISSUE. Your presence in the gallery  is needed! We MUST lobby for action.  Call VSW for exact details. 736 3746.  Your Support  is Needed  VSW supports the recommendations of  the report. We urge that this report be made more readily accessible to the public, to facilitate  public debate.  VSW supports the following course  of action:  1. Responsibility for the Equal  Employment Opportunity Program should  be assigned to the City Manager.  2. Within the Office of Equal Opportunity, reporting to the City  Manager, one person and support  staff should be appointed to the  position of Director, with appropriate budget and space commitment.  3. At the Departmental level, an  Equal Opportunity Officer should be  appointed, who will report to the  Director.  This could be a full-  time or part-time position, depending on the size of the Department.  The Director's job would include  ensuring that appropriate review,  recruitment and counselling procedures are implemented, that the  classification of jobs and pay  scales are reviewed, and that some  system is developed for evaluating  the work.  WHY IS CITY HALL UPTIGHT?  The Manager of City Hall, and the  City Councillors are kept awake  nights by the thought that this  program might cost them $$$$. They  see the costs running at $300,000  rather than the more realistic estimate of $50,000. When they think  about spending money, their morale  droops.  They also see the EEO Program as  being a quota system, due to the  phasing of the recommendations,  which advise City Hall to "develop  goals and timetables Department by  Department for each area of under-  utilization."  Reluctant councillors appear to  think that the under-representation  of women, racial and physically  handicapped minorities within their  work force is due to factors beyond  their control.  They also think that  things are improving (probably due  to factors within their control.'). MORE ABOUT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY, ALIAS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. ..  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  COMPETITION-NO  COOPERATION-YES  Winnipeg  Both Edmonton and Toronto have pushed  for equal employment opportunity at  the City Hall level. The most progress  seems, however, to have been made in  Winnipeg:  WINNIPEG - A committee similar to  the Equal Employment Opportunity  Committee at Vancouver's City Hall  has been active in the City of  Winnipeg. They have found only  one of the civic staff's 71 highest paid management positions is  held by a woman.  Furthermore,  the committee's report said women  are less likely to be promoted  than men, with only 4% reaching  higher paid occupational levels,  compared with 10% of men.  At the other end of the scale,  the committee discovered 70% of  the bottom-rung clerical jobs are  occupied by women.  It said male  city janitors earn more than  cleaning women. Parking lot  attendants are better paid than  typists. Parks maintenance men  out-earn female dental hygien-  ist9", and so on.  The City's executive policy committee has promised to heed the  committee's findings and upgrade  women employees at City Hall.  Among other things, inequitable  differentials in pay are to be  eliminated, and future hirings  will be monitored to ensure applicants are chosen on qualification rather than sex. (Globe  and Mail)  Feds, and Ontario  The Federal Government has undertaken  an Affirmative Action plan in the  civil service and all crown corporations. This is a voluntary program,  and compliance is not mandatory by  law. The Advisory Council on the  States of Women reports that very  little progress has been made.  The pntario Women's Bureau has set  up a[ service which tells businesses  how to go about implementing affirmative action. Again, the plan depends  upont management wanting to set up  the plan. About 106 buinesses have  contacted the Bureau, and results  are hard to gauge. The plan is  voluntary. (Branching Out Infd)  The lethargic performance of these  voluntary affirmative action programs  in Canada is only to be expected. The  ruling class - those in power - do  not operate against their own self-  interest. They will institute just  hirijng practices only when we force  them- to.  What we Learned  The affirmative action plan at Vancouver's City Hall - the Equal Employment Opportunities Program, is the  first in Canada which has been the  joint work of three oppressed groups  within the community : women, the  disabled and visible minorities.  The experience of working together  has been a unifying one, with the  common features of racism, sexism  and anti-handicapped prejudice  emerging in a process of discussion in which each group was able  to raise the other's consciousness.  Behind all the racist jokes about  Asian firefighters, all the sexist  jokes about women as weaklings and  all the jokes about handicapped  people is the same rationale: those  who control the economy have a vested  interest in discrimination.  They also make sure that the small gains which they have been forced to  concede under pressure are whittled  away at the first opportunity. The  abolition of the Vancouver Resources  Board, for example, will *?ipe out  the VRB's excellent affirmative action program. We will have to start  all over again.  • • •  Despite the demagogic claptrap about  "reverse discrimination" and the horrors of "quotas", the opponents of  affirmative action are advancing the  classical bourgeois view that "freedom" consists only of the "right"  of employers to set the terms under  which the workers are obliged to  sell their labour power to the bourgeois.  These terms include the absolute  necessity for the capitalists to  have at their disposal "reserves"  within the working class whose situation is even more desperate than  those of most other workers. The  reserves are thereby forced to sell  their labour at lower wages and to  accept even more oppressive working  conditions. Those "reserves" are,  in the first place, oppressed national minorities and women - giving  monopoly capitalism an enormous  stake in instutionalized racism,  national chauvinsim and male supremacy. (Silber, Guardian, 13/7/77)  Attack Under Way in U.S.  The attempt to take back those small  concessions which the}7 had to make  in the 1960s is probably the dominant feature of the move to the right  currently in full swing in the U.S.  Equal Opportunities Programs, also  known as Affirmative Action Programs,  began in the U.S. in 1968. This is  when the protest against racism was  at its peak. The U.S.federal government drew up guidelines for affirmative action for all employers who  had contracts with them. These guidelines were mandatory.  Bakke Decision  This fall, however, a case concerning affirmative action goes to the  U.S. Supreme Court.  It gives the  court the opportunity, if it chooses,  to eliminate virtually all affirmative action programs in education,  employment and housing throughout  the country.  This decisive case stems from a ruling in the California Supreme Court  in September of 1976. At that time,  the court ruled in favour of Allan  Bakke, a white student, claiming  that he had been a victim of "reverse discrimination".  Much of the  student activity at California campuses this spring and summer has  centred on the imperative need to  reverse THE BAKKE DECISION.  If the Bakke decision is upheld by  the Supreme Court, women and minorities stand to lose the few jobs they  obtained through special affirmative  action programs stemming from the  activism of the 60s and early 70s.  At a time of high unemployment and  inflation, when people are afraid of  losing their jobs, it is profitable  for the government and for industry  to keep us divided along race and  sex lines.  The Bakke decision will have an effect upon the position of women in  the U.S. labour force, and a spinoff effect upon Canadian women workers. Neither affirmative action  nor special admissions programs can  solve problems of employment and educational opportunity, but it is  necessary to protect these small  gains and to strengthen them.  (Info from UNION WAGE)   Wednesday, August 10, 1977 is NATION-* [:  AL PRISON JUSTICE DAY. ■r  National Prison Justice Day is a  day of protest. It is a day to protest the conditions endured by all  prisoners. It is a day to express  our anger at a system which uses the  law to uphold its own values and  punishes the poor, the non-white,  the dissident, and all who do not  belong to or support its power  structure.  Women are a minority of the total  prison population. Their treatment in prison is a brutal reflection of the treatment all women receive in our society, but outside  support and agitation for change  directed at their specific needs  as women is sadly lacking.  This year, in addition to the  vigil being held at the B.C.Pen,  a vigil is being held at Oakalla,  in support of the women inside.  This vigil will begin at 8.00am  on August 10th, and will last  until 8.00am the following morning. Bring your sleeping bag.  Signs and leaflets will be provided. Hopefully, there will be  a speaker. We also plan to fast  for the period of the vigil.  It is crucial for women to support  this protest. If we don't do it,  who will?  For more information, call Judi  Morton: 736 3746 (work).

MYTHS ABOUT RAPE, THE VICTIM AND THE  RAPIST  Myths are based on mistaken assumptions and erroneous information, but  they are extremely powerful. Myths  colour society's beliefs, attitudes  and actions - in this case, those  concerning the woman, the rapist and  the rape act. There is some truth  in some of the myths for some individual rape situations, but they  cannot be seen as facts about rape.  MYTH: THE RAFIST IS A STRANGER  Our experience and studies have  shown that in approximately 80% of  rapes committed, the rapist is  known to the victim.  The man may  be a neighbour, a colleague at  school or at work, an acquaintance,  an extended or immediate family  member.  MYTH: THE RAPIST IS ACTING ON UNCONTROLLABLE SEXUAL IMPULSES  The basis of this myth is that men  cannot control their sexual impulses. The idea is erroneous. Men  CAN control their sexual desires.  In fact, most rapes are not acts  of "impulse" but are premeditated;  58% of one man-one woman rapes,  83% of rapes involving 2 men, and  90% of rapes committed by 3 or more  men are premeditated.  MYTH: RAPISTS ARE CRAZED BOOGIE MEN  A rapist does not have fangs and  pointed ears. Like most people,  rapists have hang-ups, but these do  not differ significantly from those  of the "average" man on the street.  In most cases, rape is not a product  of mental illness - a rapist could  look and act like the "normal" man  across the hall or the stranger in  the elevator.  MYTH: RAPE IS AN ACT MOTIVATED BY  SEXUAL DESIRE  This is not true. Rape is an act  of violence and aggression or domination and humiliation.  Sex is  merely the means of assault. Rape  is not based on a need for sexual  contact - 50% of rapists do not  ejaculate'.  Rape is based on a desire to degrade and control a woman  by forcing her to have sexual intercourse against her will.  MYTH: RAPE HAPPENS IN DARK ALLEYS  50% of all rapes occur in a home.  A rapist may break into a woman's  home or she may open her door to a  friend, a neighbour, a serviceman.  A woman may go home with a man  after a date, after work, etc. Rape  also occurs in situations that seem  dangerous - hitchhiking, underground  garages, parks, deserted streets...  MYTH: ONLY CERTAIN WOMEN GET RAPED  Rape can happen to any woman regardless of her age, physical appearance,  character, lifestyle, ethnic origin  or place of residence. We have  heard of 6-month-old babies as well  as 90-year-old women who have been  victims of rape.  MYTH: THE REAL RAPE VICTIM WILL BE  BATTERED, BRUISED AND HYSTERICAL  Rape is always traumatic - this is  true regardless of the reactions of  the rape victim. People behave  differently in a crisis.  In the  same way, v/omen who have been raped  show a variety of reactions - hysterical crying, shocked apathy, calm  "coping" behavior.  If a woman is  controlled and outwardly calm, it  does not mean that she wasn't raped*  Similarly, lack of bruises or broken bones does not indicate a woman  has not been raped. Often threats  of violence and a weapon at her  throat, rather than actual violence  are enough to cause a woman to  "freeze" in a rape situation.  In .  fear for her life, a woman submits  but this does not mean she consents.  (From the WAR Newsletter,   Vol 1,  ¬ß1,  614 Milton St, Nanaimo B.C.)

(from Majority Report)  Trashy  THIS GARBAGE CAMPAIGN IS PURE TRASH  Environment Canada has laboured  mightily to produce a piece of garbage. Mile. Can-Can is the new symbol of the Environment Ministry's  Waste Watching campaign aimed at  making school children litter-conscious.  Mile. Can-Can is a sloe-eyed, long-  lashed feminized garbage can complete with long black-gloved arms  and cinched by a bright pink girdle  (as in corset).  She is the main focus of buttons,  brochures and messages being circulated by the ministry in its campaign.  Ontario Status of Women representative commented: "It's almost unbelievable to speak about waste and  garbage, and use that kind of sexist  approach!"  A spokesperson for the Environment  Ministry was at a loss for words.  "Maybe we should have a Mr. Can-Can.  I don't know."  (Info from Globe  ,and Mail)  Cut it Out  Radical mastectomies have become an  accepted way of treating breast cancer without any proof as to their  effectivenss, says a major new study  of surgery.  "A radical mastectomy is so frequently the treatment of choice that it  would almost seem that a tradition  has been established without clear-  cut justification," says the report  by an agency of Harvard University.  TheJireport says a radical mastectomy  "is, no more effective than simple  surgery in terms of survival exper-  ien:e, and the chances of local or  distant recurrence."  "It^does, however, cost more in dollar^ and hospital stay and does induce more morbidity, more mutilation,  and more traumatic psychological  adjustment as well as carrying a  great risk of surgical death."

The ACSW (national Advisory Council  on the Status of Women) has noted  that in 1975, the age differential  between male and female public servants widened, the concentration of  women in lower-paid administrative  support positions increased, and  the number of women in senior executive positions decreased during  the year.  T-Shirt Self-Exam  In April of 1976, workers in the  maternal health area developed a  pilot project to teach breast self-  examination to high school students  in Vancouver.  Films, supplemented  by a talk from the school nurse,  were followed with an opportunity  for students to be taught breast  self-exam on a one-to-one basis.  Nurses, students, parents were enthusiastic.  Several high school principals,  however, objected to women 'baring  their breasts', and one insisted  that they demonstrate only with a  t-shirt on.  The program was eventually discouraged by the City's  Medical Health Officer. Nurses  were asked to keep the program low-  profile by not advertising it. As  a result, the program was never  developed.  Your test scores are excellent  but your grovelling and snivelling stores are low.  Class Divisions  The National Council of Welfare recently pointed to a discrepancy in the  tax laws which means that the richer  a woman is, the less she pays in taxes.  According to the 1976 tax schedule, a  woman working as non-union store clerk  and earning about $6,000 a year will  pay about $520 in taxes.  If she is  supporting a child and has to pay for  a baby-sitter, she can deduct a maximum of $1,000.  The child care deduction offers her a  tax saving of $520 minus $260, which  equals $260.  But take a woman with a teaching degree.  If she is making $20,000 a year  as a unionized teacher, she pays about  $4,970 in tax.  However, if she also has a child and  is able to deduct the $1,000, her taxes are reduded to $4,590.  So the  school teacher enjoys a tax saving  of $380 - that's $120 more than the  store clerk.  Vancouver Sun  Human Rights Ignored  BILL C-25 (the federal human rights  bill) has received final reading in  the House of Commons. The bill discriminates against the emotionally  handicapped by not mentioning them.  It discriminates against gay people  by not mentioning them.

Pregnancy Compensation  Now for slightly better news. The  Maryland Senat-e has passed and sent  to the House bills requiring that  private employers and health insurance companies compensate women  workers for up to 6 weeks of time  lost from work due to pregnancy.  The fact that this legislation classifies pregnancy as a 'disability'  is distasteful, but establishment  of the principle of compensation for  childbirth time is important.  The  Supreme Cburt in its wisdom has refused to consider exclusion of pregnancy compensation to be a violation  of federal anti-sex discrimination  laws, so the readiest alternative is  to have individual states enact laws  requiring maternity coverage.  So  far, 14 states have done so.  In Maryland, the bill faces stiff  opposition in the House, particularly from the insurance lobby, which  has numerous tame lawmakers.

It concerns a rape trial in Italy,  which the feminist movement there  made the focus of a national cam-  paigna  It is of particular relevance to  B.C.feminists at this time, when  we are working towards a concerted  anti-rape action on November 5th.  A.s this action builds,  it is important to have a clear analysis of  rape as a feminist issue. It is  important to relate this analysis  to the .specific actions we undertake. KINESIS would welcome such  analysis.  Wiry does our society have  a vested, interest in controlling women through rape and other related  crimes of violence,  such as wife-  battering and pornography.  Who,  exactly who profits from this?  Do all other socieities have tlie  same vested interest in supporting  rape? If not, why not? Does rape  have anything in common with, for  example, prostitution? With the  way our labour (women's and men's  both) is ripped off at the workplace?    How does the alienation  which produces rape function in  our society? What causes that alienation?  ROME- Claudia Caputi, the eighteen-  year-old Italian woman gang-raped  last August, has disappeared with  the help of feminists following the  sentencing of seven youths by a  Rome court, and the arrest of Vito  Gemma, a man undoubtedly linked to  the prostitution racket.  Claudia's disappearance is the most  recent in a long, traumatic series  of events that have ultimately implicated not only organized crime,  but also government collusion,  throwing the feminist movement  into pandemonium by forcing it  to confront the issue of prostitution.  In the process, however, some fundamental questions about the ideological basis of feminism have been  raised and hopefully the polemic  will serve as one mechanism for  combatting the existing social stru- .  cture.  Claudia's background is by Italian  standards not uncommon. Raised in  a poverty-stricken village, she  attempted to abandon provincial misery by answering a nexvrspaper ad.  for a maid in Rome. Once in the city,  she. found that her employer, Vito  Gemma, was seeking not only a housekeeper but a bedmate as well. Without money, friends, or family, she  resigned herself to the situation.  Then she met Nicola Vinciprova, a  youth about her age. Last August  30, when the two of them took a  bike ride, he and seventeen of his  friends gang-raped her.  The rape trial had its first hearing March 29. The second hearing  was set for April 4. But before that  date, Claudia was abducted, raped  again, and this time repeatedly  slashed with a razor. The judge,  an extreme conservative, interrogated Claudia at the hospital without her lawyers. He then sent not  ification that her charges about  the second rape were under suspicion.  He suggested that he had "simulated  the offense" and "self-inflicted"  the wounds.  The lawyer's move is emblematic of  how legal systems the world over  have consistently treated women in  rape cases, trying to make a guilty  party out of the victim.  At the second hearing, April 4,  Claudia's lawyers accused the judge  of "adhering to the same ideology  of violence as that of the accused  youths". Meanwhile, the women's  movement continued to organize around the case, mobilizing in groups  of ten thousand and five thousand.  An incredible amount of organizing  materialized, directed by a central  co-ordinating committee with representatives from all Rome collectives, constituting a unique moment  of solidarity in Italy's multi-fact-  ioned feminist movement.  Unity prevailed until the fact of  Claudia's prostitution began to  surface. Although some women recognized rape as a political phenomenon that profoundly illustrates  the exploitation of women, prostitution called painfully into play all  the contradictions of a deeply  ingrained religious upbringing and  the strongly family-oriented society  of Italy.  The complexity increased as the  search for an immediate political  strategy began. Some passionately  declared all women to be prostitutes  and called for another mass demonstration. But the question remained:  what concrete effect would it have  in the struggle to change a social  order where rape and other more  insidious forms of violence against  women are rampant at all levels?  Claudia's lawyers decided to keep  discussion of prostitution out of  the case until conditions were  more favourable. The feminists  were unable to come to a united,  up-front stand on prostitution.  The alternate press, which had  the responsibility to point out  the movement's ideological weaknesses and to present articles  analyzing prostitution in general,  thus expanding its relevance to  socialist, feminist thought,  did not do so.  In sensationalizing Claudia's  individual story, the original  intention of making this a test  case for rape diminished. She no  longer spoke for the position cf women in an economic system which exploits them and a legal system which  maintains their repression. Rape  symbolizes this reality, but so does  prostitution. If women are excluded  from the labour market - only 19%  of Italian women are employed and  this number is decreasing - and society refuses to take responsibility  for this labour surplus, prostitution  is the only avenue open for women  like Claudia.  The growth of a genuine, revolutionary feminist movement depends  on our understanding and combatting  the mechanisms which produce mass  poverty, prostitution and rape. All  of them are part of Claudia's experience, turn to col.2,p.20  MEET THE JUSTICE  v - 'ñ†<  JUDGE RULES RAPIST "NORMAL"  When a 15 year old boy raped a girl  in the stairwell at West High School  in Wisconsin, Judge Simonson ruled  he was reacting "normally" to the  prevalent sexual permissiveness  and women's provocative clothing.  The judge decreed that the youth  should be permitted to stay at  home under court supervision rather than be placed in an institution.  The anti-rape forces in Wisonsin  are now gathering more than 20  thousand signatures needed to  force a recall election against  the judge. A special election for  Simonson's seat will be held 40-  45 days after the petitions have  been turned in.  Simonson attacked the anti-rape  forces as being "a group of strange  bedfellows including lesbians,  atheists, Marxists and members of  the National Organization of Women."  (info from The Guardian and Through  the Looking Glass)  The U.S.Supreme Court has ruled  that the death penalty may not  be used as a punishment for rape  when the victim is an adult. Women  active in the movement against  rape approve of the decision as  being one of the rare progressive  moves made by the Court. "Our aim  is to destroy the system that encourages rape - not to give racists  an excuse to persecute Black men."  In the U.S., of the 455 men executed for rape since 1930, more than  90% have been Black. (Guardian info)  If only she hadn't struggled...she  wouldn't have fractured ribs, serious  internal injuries, torn earlobes.  This is what Justice Wein, in London,  England, thinks about a rape victim.  English feminists are organizing  against his decision.  The woman, Carol Maggs, 17, was sexually assaulted by Coldstream Guard  Tom Holdsworth, 19. The judge reversed the three year sentence for  Holdsworth, giving him, instead,  a six-month suspended sentence.  According to Justice Wein, Holdsworth  is " a man of previous good character whose army career would be completely destroyed if this sentence  were to stand."  Carol Maggs commented: " He (Holdsworth) must be laughing up his  sleeve. What has his job got to do  with it? He spent less time in  prison than I had treatment. I was  unable to work for four months.'Äû.I  was on crutches for days and had  medical and psychiatric treatment  for four months." from Globe and Mail Women  Round the World  Chile  Each month, KINESIS takes part in a  letter-writing campaign for the release of Chilean political prisoners.

Twenty-six women and two men'risked  their lives recently when they occupied the UN offices in Santiago,  Chile and held a 10-day hunger  strike. They were protesting the  2,000 political prisoners who have  "disappeared". These are the people kidnapped by General Pinochet's  Gestapo-style secret police (the  DINA). Their arrests and whereabouts are never acknowledged by  the State. The system of "disappearances" permits the junta to  torture and execute while at the  same time denying it.  The hunger strike sparked off solidarity actions around the world,  which in turn effectively pressured  Pinodhet into conceding some demands  to the strikers,  (info from THE GUARDIAN)  ENGLAND - Last September a group of  women, "the Holbrook Road cleaners"  went on strike when they discovered  they'd been sweeping up asbestos  dust.

Women of Mozambique  This month, KINESIS features comments from the women of Mozambique.  rl|  In these excerpts, they speak for  themselves.  The second conference of the Organ-      ii  ization of Mozambican women  (0MM)  was held in November 1976,  focusing  on the role of women in independent  Mozambique.    The OMM was formed by  the Mozambique Liberation Front  (FRELIMC) during the struggle against Portuguese colonialism.  With the winning of the struggle  against colonialism the organizing  of women stopped, and OMM failed to  build structures that would inte-        I  grate women into the reconstruction  process.    Many of the women at the  Second Conference felt the result  was that women were being forced  back into their traditional African  role or,  in towns,  into a new bourgeois role  - both cases considered  secondary support for the men rather than an integral part of the  revolution.    It was the women who  had been in the armed struggle who  took the initiative in demanding  that OMM not forget its fundamental role of organizing the women  both to combat the oppression they  suffered as women and to mobilize  them for equal participation with  the men in building socialism.  Following are excerpts from the  resolutions passed by the women at  the Conference.  Illiteracy  Illiteracy affects the vast majority  of the Mozambican people.  It has a  particularly high incidence among  women who were doubly exploited in  traditional and colonial society,  which instilled in women a feeling  of inferiority and dependence and  conditioned them merely to please  men and run a household.  In Mozambique, the problem is made  worse for those who have not been  to school because that means they  cannot speak Portuguese, which is  the official language of communication. This limits women's access  to information.  Because of illiteracy, a large proportion of the delegates to the Second Conference could  not follow the reading and discussion  of reports.  Women play a fundamental role in educating the new generation.  They  must take part in production and  move from simply carrying out tasks  to planning and directing them, to  free their creative initiative.  Learning the official language will  strengthen feelings of unity and militate against regionalism, tribalism,  and divisions.  For all these reasons, eradicating illiteracy among  women must be one of the top priorities of OMM.  Tribalism and Racism  Tribalism and regionalism have their  origins in feudal society. We are  familiar with stories of inter-tribal warfare passed down from our  forefathers.  Such wars were greatly  exploited by the colonial regime.  Racism is a product of colonialism:  it marks a clear distinction between  the colonizer and the colonized.  The exploiter and oppressor despises  and humiliates those he exploits on  the basis of difference in skin colour. Racism is the highest form of  humiliation.  Tribalism and racism are equally divisive in that they prevent people  from understanding that our country  is Mozambique and needs the strength  of all the people for reconstruction.  The struggle was carried forward by  Mozambicans of all races and regions.  Through their suffering, their effort, and through working together,  they forged unity. Women must continue to work and learn from other  people's experiences in order to  understand that the struggle of Mozambican women is the struggle of  all women and people throughout the  world against the common enemy: exploitation.  Women must fight the incorrect belief that they can only identify  with those from the same land or with  the same culture and habits as themselves. Our identity lies in our  condition of being exploited and oppressed and in the common struggle  for freedom.  It is a class identity.  (In addition to other forms of work)  the OMM must encourage the setting  up of "communal neighbourhoods",  which will help to eliminate individualism through the shared experiences of collective work with people  of various origins.  Inferiority Complexes  The process of rendering women inferior originates in traditional  education.  It is reinforced by  "Initiation rites" and other such  traditional practices which lead to  passive acceptance and lack of initiative. The woman becomes an object of appropriation and pleasure,  bartered by her family and subjugated to her husband's will. On  top of this age-old process, women  also suffered the humiliation of  colonial society which robbed them  continued col.3,p.20 Sisterhood makes the newS  Lead Levels  General Motors refuses to hire un-  sterilized women to work in plants  where workers are exposed to lead,  "We do not allow women to work on  lead exposure jobs unless they are  incapable of having children, either because of hysterectomy or tubal  ligation," a GM plant doctor said.  GM worker Norma James underwent  sterilization rather than lose her  job in the lead battery plant at  Whitby, Ontario.  She is one of  the many women forced to accept  sterilization in order to keep a  job.  Corporations such as GM have  decided it is better to hire only  sterilized women rather than face  possible lawsuits by parents of  deformed children born to mothers  exposed to lead.  The Coalition of  Labour Union Women (a U.S. group)  has called for the establishment  of a lead standard that would protect the health of all workers.  Corporations have united to protest any attempt at significantly  lower permissable lead levels in  plants.  (Guardian/J. Brown)  Air Canada's Sexism  AIR CANADA GRANTS TRAVEL PASSES TO  THE COMMON LAW SPOUSES OF ITS EMPLOYEES.  Among other requirements, Air Canada regulations specify that employees' common law spouses cannot  have access to passes unless the  common law wife is using her "husband's" surname.  If the employee  is male, this presents few problems  as the common law wife can simply  use his name for the purpose of  applying for and getting passes.  If the employee is female, however,  Air Canada has ruled that her common  law spouse cannot have access to  passes unless the employee uses her  "husband's" surname in all her dealings with the company, including  employee identification, pay cheques,  etc.  Air Canada's female common law employees are reluctant to follow this  rule, especially when no such requirement exists for legally-married employees. Upon being asked  what it intended to do about this  matter, Air Canada answered that the  question was presently under study  but that the company had no immediate plans to correct the situation.

Lesbian Mothers  On July 13, WAGES DUE LESBIANS organized a picket in front of the  Ontario Supreme Court to protest  the treatment of lesbian mothers  and children of lesbians.  The  action had the support of a broad  coalition of Toronto groups.  The  fight is not just a fight for the  rights of lesbian mothers.  It is  the fight for the right of all women to determine how and with whom  they will live, and for the right  of children to decide what happens  in their lives.  The picketers organized their protest around the  following four points:  * We refuse to choose between our  sexuality and our children.  * Hands off our children!  * A parent's income should not be  a criterion in court for a custody  decision.  * We refuse to be penalized by our  poverty.  / ¬a v  ALL KINESIS READERS WHOSE NAMES  BEGIN M-Z RECEIVED TWO COPIES OF  THIS ISSUE.

J  SORWUC  The Service, Office & Retail Workers  Union of Canada (SORWUC) has signed  its first collective agreement with  a financial institution - the Electrical Trades Credit Union in Burnaby .       i  The contract provides a significant  advancement in wages, benefits and  working conditions for a comparatively small bargaining unit - three  employees.  It is the feeling of the  Union that this will set a precedent  and will encourage employees of  other financial institutions - banks,  credit unions, trust companies - to  join together to gain bargaining  power.  The Agreement provides for wages of  $875 per month for a 33-hour work  week for clerk-tellers, and vacations of 3 weeks plus 2 working days  in the first year of employment; 4  weeks in the fourth year and 5 weeks  in the seventh year. As well, it  includes clauses important to working conditions: no arbitrary dress  code; cash shortages cannot be deducted from a teller's wages; and  employees will be consulted before  new equipment is introduced or any  renovations are made to premises.  A major accomplishment of the agreement is that it provides that part-  time employees are entitled to all  the benefits.  They receive sick  leave and vacations on the same basis as full-time employees, at their  average rate of pay.  They are covered by medical and dental plans,  with the employer paying a percentage of the premium based on the  number of hours the employee works.

Anyone who is living in Canada on  less than $3,981 a year is living  in poverty, David Croll (a Liberal  Senator) said in Toronto, Wednesday, March 16.  Croll circulated in the Senate a  chart showing poverty lines based  on 1976 incomes and calculated on a  formula devised by the Senate committee on poverty in 1971.  The  Senate formula puts poverty levels  at a higher income than those announced by the government through  Statistics Canada, or by two private organizations - the Economic  Council of Canada and the Canadian  Council on Social Development.  The Senate poverty level for an individual is now set at $3,981 compared with $3,490 based on 1975  incomes. For a couple poverty  starts at $6,635. The poverty  level for a family of three is  set at $7,962; for a family of four  at $9,289; for a family of five at  $10,616; for a family of six at  $11,943; for a family of seven at  $13,270; for a family of eight at  $14,597; for a family of nine at  $15,924; and for a family of ten  at $17,251.  Vancouver Sun 17/3/77 BILL 65  from page one.  is an increased demand for social  •services due to unemployment, they  make a stigma out of welfare. Those  who cannot find employment are lazy  sluggards who won't get "off their  butts". Along with these measures  goes budget-trimming: fewer and  fewer  services for women, for  children, for the aged, for the  handicapped. Any notion that these  service's are a human right and  not a priviledge must be suppressed.  Budget-trimming if facilitated by  centralized control. The futher  away the consumer of services can  be kept from the dispenser of services, the better. It means that  the consumer can't start to make  a stink, to assert her/his anger,  let alone power.  Women don't have human rights in  B.C. We have services to compensate  for their lack. And little by little  the present government is legislating those services away.

The delegates representing United  Ban Workers, Local 2 of SORWUC, decided to call a wage and contract conference for September 10 and 11. The  conference will bring together bank  workers from all over B.C. to prepare  contract proposals to take to negotiations with the banks to cover all  certified branches in B.C.  SORWUC was certified Friday, July 22  to represent about 60 employees at  five bank branches - the first certified bank branches ever in B.C.  The Canada Labour Relations Board  ordered representation votes at  12 branches, and ten more applications are pending before the Board.  SORWUC Local 1 reported to the convention that they now hold 17 certifications including restaurants,  a neighborhood pub, offices and social service workers.  Transition House  A collective agreement has been signed  between Local 1 of the Service, Office  and Retail Workers Union of Canada,  and the Vancouver Resource Board. The  agreement covers S.O.R.W.U.C. members  who are V.R.B. employees at Transition House. This House is a refuge  for women (and their children) who  are in crisis. Most of the women using  the shelter are battered wives.  The most significant gain for the  employees under this fourth collective agreement is a work week averaging  23 hours, which recognizes the strain  of rotating shifts at a facility  that is staffed around the clock, 7  days a week.  A wage increment was granted, bringing the hourly pay rate to $7.42. Continuing the precedent set in their  first agreement, March 8, International Women's Day, is designated as a  statutory holiday. The employees are  also covered by the Vancouver Resource  Board fringe benefits package which  includes a fully paid dental plan,  long term disability benefits and  full paid life insurance and extended  health benefits.  What will happen to these fringe benefits when the V.R.B. is legislated  out of existence...?  SUPPORT SORWUC in their work. You  can become involved by calling them  at 681 2811 or 684 2834. Their address: #1116-207 West Hastings, Van. tOhsiS WOman        by Com Hubert  She really didn't know which was  worse, afternoons or days.  It  seemed like afternoons threw mealtimes all to hell, you were either  cooking meals, warming up meals,  packing lunch boxes or... something  ...until you felt as if the electric stove was connected to your  bellybutton. Ken didn't always  eat when he got up, so he'd need  something before he went on shift,  but the kids didn't want to eat a  big hot meal that early, they  weren't hungry right after school,  they wanted to go out and play. So  if Ken got his hot meal, they got  it warmed up two or three hours  later, which was a hell of a lot  of one day tied up in one meal.  Then dishes and the kids in bed by  eight-thirty, and she packed lunches  for the two who were in school, not  real lunches, they came home for  lunch, but a snack in a brown bag  for recess, made them feel big, and  it only took a minute or two. Maybe do a bit of ironing, and wait  for Ken, not due home until one.  Hadn't been too bad before they'd  moved to Tahsis, but Ken, he said  he was tired of tromping up and down  the slopes lugging beads with the  sun frying his face or the rain pissing down the back of his neck, and  the rents were so high if you had  kids that there was no way you'd  ever get saved up for a place of  your own.  Go to Tahsis, he said,  there's work in the mill, they pay  top wages, and maybe we can get a  company house. Nice new houses,  and the rent subsidized by the company, hell you couldn't rent a  chicken coop out here for what  you'll pay for a three bedroom  basement brand new in there.  Put  in all the overtime I can, save  like a bunch of rug riders, and in  four or five years we've got enough  to put down on our own place.  Well, the company houses were full  and the list was as long as a tall  man's leg and she didn't want to  live outside and have him in the  bunkhouse, coming home to visit when  he could, so here they were in a  trailer-house on the trailer-court  and already the entire plan was  changed because the payments on the  trailer were higher than any rent  had ever been, but, as Ken said, at  least they weren't just flushing  the money down the toilet, they were  building up an equity, as good as  money in the bank, and could always  sell when it was time to move out  again.  But it was sure no hell living in a trailer court with tin boxes  plunked down on hog fuel filling  what used to be a swamp. Mind you,  the company was good about it, every  spring they gave out all the bedding  plants you needed to make your space  nice, and they had a gardener went  around mowing the lawns and wrecking  his lawnmower on rocks and nearly  taking the legs off every dog and  kid in the court. And they's brought  in a truckload of little shrubs,  that made it nice.  She'd kind of  laughed, though, there they were surrounded by trees and mountains and  sea, living on a filled-in swamp,  planting inky-dinky shrubs and you  looked out any window in the trailer and you could see trees so big  one of them would build a house.  But they didn't build houses of wood  in Tahsis; stucco houses and aluminum trailers and all the wood taken  off in freighters to places that  used to be just names in the atlas  at school.  At least on the Outside you had television to pass the time: here, it  was a joke.  It was all probably illegal, but she'd sure like to see  them take everyone to court about  it, she knew what she'd say if they  hauled her in, she'd just say: Lis-  ten, mister, I read in the paper  that it's costing every man, woman,  and child in Canada five dollars a  year for the CBC and with me and Ken  and four kids, that's thirty dollars  you owe us for every year we've been  up here S.O.L. so pay up.  That's  what she'd tell them. There used  to be a cablevision but it went  belly-up, so there they were with  most of the town wired up for something that didn't work anymore. But  you can get these things you plug  alongside a TV and you can tape the  programme and some of the people had  got together and got some of these  and put them on sets with friend6 in  Campbell River or someplace, and the  friends shipped in the tapes. If it  was a really good one, you could phone  the guy and ask him to re-play it,  like if you were on shift and you  missed the one about Archie and the  guy who thought he was a woman and gave  mouth-to-mouth to, and you heard  everyone talking about it, well,  you just phoned the guy and he replayed it for you. Which was a bit  boring for anyone who'd already seen  it, but better than nothing.  Except  when the tapes were late coming in  or something.  Some days and evenings the screen was blank, sometimes  you got half of one movie and half  of another and it didn't make any  sense but it was something to pass  the time.  It was the weather and the country  had put the cablevision belly-up;  trees falling over in the wind, the  rain washing the side away, always  lines broken and the expense of  going out, finding the break, fixing it, finding another one. And  the mountains stopped the regular  signal from coming in, you couldn't  have an aerial higher than the  mountains for heavens sake, it would  fall over for sure.  God, she thought  for the umpteenth time, God, Eskimos  in igloos in Aklavik get colour TV  piped in but we're on the wrong side  of the island, we're S.O.L. We  don't even have a dentist, if you're  lucky you can get in to see the volunteer dentist the shantymen bring  in to the mission at Esperanza, but  that's like waiting for the second  coming, everyone from so many little  towns, outports and float camps,  all trying to get the kids to the  same volunteer dentist who only came  in on weekends anyway, and usually  never the same one twice. We're  S.O.L. over here, and nobody cares.  Pay through the nose for taxes but  what do you get.  Ken said it was  getting screwed without getting  kissed, but they won't listen no  matter what you say anyway.  During the day you could get CBC  radio.  Some of the programmes were  good although a lot of the time you  didn't have any idea what in hell  they were talking about; art galleries when you don't even have a  proper library, well, it doesn't  mean much. Reviews of plays seem  a waste of time when all you've  got is one movie and it's not open  every night, and if it was open you  could be sure that at some point,  at least once, maybe more often,  the damned thing would stick or  something. Once they'd sat and  watched while the light burned a  hole in the film and on the screen  this brown scorch patch got bigger  and bigger, it vras kind of creepy.  (over) Tahsis Woman.  _Tahsis Woman  And at night, Well, forget it,  either you got seventy-eleven stations jamming in at once and everything all jumbled, or you got static  that hurt your ears.  One of the  kids from the high school who babysat for them sometimes, he said it  was "skip" and had something to do  with the cloud cover at night. Anyway, on afternoons, when would you  get the chance to really listen to  the radio? Kids in and out all day  and then you had to get the vacuuming done, on afternoons she didn't  vacuum until after Ken had got up,  it wasn't fair, he needed his sleep.  But it had to be done before the  kids went to bed, that's all they'd  need, an excuse to lallygag up and  down the hallway; drink of water,  need a pee, something in my eye,  Teddy won't stop squirming...  So you do Artex, like oil paint in  a tube with a ballpoint tip. Already she'd done a big wall hanging  of a tiger glaring.  (Ken said the  be-buggered beast is cross-eyed,  and they'd laughed because it almost was.) And she'd done a nice  tablecloth.  It faded when she'd  washed it, but she'd touched it up  and it was really nice.  Sometimes  Sally came over and they had tea  and Artex'ed together, or maybe two  or three of the girls would come 'Äû  over, and they'd maybe play cards  or something.  The ones with older  kids had sort of built-in babysitters  and could get out of a time without  having to worry about a sitter.  Be  nice when hers were older. Although,  you don't know, after Myra's girl got  that infection, well, maybe it was  real true, Little kids, little worries, Big kids, big worries, but what  could you expect, really, with freighters here from all over everywhere  and there comes a time you can't keep  your; kids right with you all the time,  and the seamen with the run of the  town while they loaded lumber and god  knows what kind of infections they've  got.  But some nights nobody came and so  you just Artex'ed and maybe read or  knit or crocheted.  She had sweaters  done for all the nieces and nephews  and the afghan would be nice when it  was finished.  It was for Ken's  mother, even he didn't know about it,  a real Christmas surprise.  He'd be home in a few hours. Just a  few more hours. Maybe she'd have a  bath, a nice long soak with some  herb-scented bath beads. Maybe wash  her hair with that new no-tear shampoo, a baby shampoo made by a family-  run factory in Maine or some place,  all natural ingredients, PH balanced,  the father invented it when his baby  girl was born and you could pretty  well be sure it would be good for  you, a man wouldn't put together  something that wouldn't be good for  his own baby girl's hair.  It would  curl up nice and soft and she could  dry it and style it with the new blow  comb thing Ken gave her for her birthday. Then her pink wrapper and when  he got home, well, while he showered  the sawdust off and the smell of that  awful stuff they soaked the boards  in, he could have a beer, Ken loved  to drink a beer in the shower, he  said it made him feel real ritzy  like those sheiks with harems and  big sunken tubs full of warm water  and dancing girls to wash his back.  And after eight hours in that awful  place, a man deserved a chance to  feel as ritzy as hell on wheels.  He'd be too tired to really eat,  they always were, but she knew he'd  grin when she gave him a second beer  and the invitation plate.  Some thin  sliced salami, cheese hunks, some  crackers and a slice of Hovis bread  with real butter. Ken loved real  butter, but you couldn't afford it  for everyday use so mostly they used  margarine but she liked to keep a  bit stored away for times when he  might need just a little boost, so  he could feel maybe a bit special,  like. And some pickled eggs, she  made her own, the price of eggs in  the CoOp was godawful high when  the egg was two weeks old and raw,  try to buy one pickled and the price  would make your appetite wither.  Anyway, Ken said hers were better  and it didn't take all that long to  make up a dozen or so now and again.  He'd grin when he saw two eggs on  his invitation plate, everyone knew  the jokes about pickled eggs and  beer, and how they caused action.  Flash all night and fart all day,  although the men - and some women  lately - didn't use the word Flash,  they used that other, awful word.  Ken would grin and say Oh God save  me, work like a dog for hours on  end and come home to a sex maniac.  Lord God gimme another egg, Lord  God gimme strength.  In the morning she'd crawl out of  bed with sand under her eyelids,  close the bedroom door so the early  morning noise wouldn't bother him.  A working man needs his sleep. Get  Alex and Erin off to school, Pierre  outside to play, and try to keep  Teddy from making too much noise.  He loved to get into the cupboards  and bang the lids on the pots and  pans. Or crawl into the bathroom,  pull himself upright and flush,  flush, flush, maybe even pull the  toilet roll from the dingus and  throw the roll into the bowl. Last  week, he pulled over the big Christmas cactus, the first of the four  kids to even think of doing that.  It fell and the big blue glazed pot  cracked and fell into half a dozen  pieces, dirt scattered all over the  carpet and leaves, arms, stems broke  from the main plant and lay there,  accusing her of...something . It  was all she could do not to blow up,  she could feel herself fighting the  urge to beat him, to pummel and kick  and scream God damn you, Teddy, you  bastard, that plant was more than  forty years old, you little shit my  grandmother left that to me when she  died, you dirty little...But he was  so scared!  The noise, the fall, the  dirt, the look on her face, and his  little eyes welled with tears and he  said his first sentence "I so'y,  mommy.  Ken came flying out of the bedroom  ballsass naked and saw her crying  over the broken memories, Teddy crying because mommy was crying and a  mountain had crumbled. He picked  Teddy up quickly, put him in bed  with a popsicle for heavens sake,  and it will take forever to get the  stains out of the sheets, orange  popsicle melting onto the pale blue  sheets. Then Ken came to her, bent  over, still naked, and helped her  pick up the mess. He put all the  broken pieces of the plant on a damp  paper towel, then he got dressed and  left the trailer without saying  where he was going.  She vacuumed  up the dirt, still crying, remembering her grandmother's parlour and  the even-then huge plant sitting  on a small table, and her grandmother smiling and saying It's yours  when I'm gone, honey, and now it  was all smashed and Teddy had cried  himself to sleep and might never  know what it was he had broken.  Then Ken came back in the trailer  and she started crying all over  again, he'd gone down to see Dawn  Tanner and come back with small  pots, potting soil, rooting hormone,  and he held her close and teased  her, hey, old woman, the trailer's  only waterproof on the outside,  you're gonna flood us out, come on,  now, get your shit together and  make me something to eat. And. he  sat gluing the pieces of the old  pot together with Krazy Glue, and  sure you could tell it had been  smashed and glued back together,  but who cared, he got it all fixed  up and then they took all the broken off bits and potted them, and  they were growing.  Even the old  plant was doing well, maybe the  shaking up had done her some good.  One thing for sure, Teddy stayed  away from it now.  From it and  everything else that looked as if  it might tumble down and make a  noise.  But sure as hell, as sure  as anything, you could be sure he'd  find something new. You could bet  dollars against the holes in doughnuts that kid would find something  else to get into before long.  But that was only one day that Ken  got disturbed. Usually she managed  to keep it down to a dull roar and  he could catch up on his rest.  She  made beds, dusted, started the washing, brought Pierre in, protesting,  and set him on the toilet. When he  was inside he was fully toilet  trained but if you let him outside  and he got playing with the other  kids, he'd have too much fun to  leave it just to go pee. Maybe  she'd better drain him now, too,  because he slept so soundly he'd  pee the bed without waking up. Ken  said the river could flood the  trailer and Pierre would just roll  over and sleep harder.  Sometimes  he'd be asleep and all around him  the sheet would be wet with sweat,  and she'd worried about that, someone told her it was the first sign  of either diabetes or TB, night  sweats, but they had him checked  over and it was nothing, Ken said  it was like everything else he did,  he did it so completely it became  hard work for him and he slept so  soundly he sweat doing it.  She walked him, still asleep, down  the hallway. He was too heavy to  carry, a big boned boy, he'd be  huge, like her brother, although  god help us hopefully he'd be smarter.  She pulled down his pyjamas,  aimed it for him, then turned on  the cold water tap in the sink.  Pee Pierre, Pee for mommy, she said,  and he did.  Eyes shut, still asleep  swaying a bit, he peed. Funny how  the sound of running water made a  kid pee. Adults, too, probably.  She shook it for him, pulled his  jammers back up and led him, sleepy  but trusting, back to his bed. He'd  stay dry all night, now.  Getting to sleep about three in the  morning, Ken would sleep until just  about noon.  The kids would be home  for lunch, and he'd need breakfast;  damn afternoons, meals were insane!  Then the two little ones had to take  a nap.  Finish the washing and fold  the stuff from the dryer and it was  time to pack Ken's "lunch" which  he'd eat around eight at night, and  feed him before he went to work.  Some days he didn't want to eat before he left, it depended a lot on  if he'd just had toast and coffee  at his noon breakfast, or if he'd  had bacon and eggs, you could never  be sure, every day was different  and yet somehow the same.  And either you went short of sleep  or you never got to see your man.  He'd get up and you'd be busy, and  the little ones wanting this and  needing that, and a couple of hours  later, he'd be off to work. And if  you try to go to bed early, well,  she'd tried it, hoping she could  get a few hours sleep and wake up  feeling fresh when Ken got home,  but, for one thing, after ten years  of marriage, she couldn't get to  sleep easily in a bed by herself.  And if she did get to sleep, Ken  knew as soon as he came in the door,  and then he'd tip-toe around, quiet  as a mouse, not wanting to disturb  her because he knew if she'd managed to get to sleep alone it was  because she was wiped out and weary.  She'd tried napping in the afternoon, but that just gave her a headache. Unless Ken decided to nap  with her and then, of course, neither of them got to sleep and he  hated to get up and go to work after  loving, actually she didn't much  like to have to get up from a warm  bed when the kids woke up from their  nap and wanted juice or a pee or  outside to play.  At least on days you all got up together and had at least two meals  a day together and after the kids  were in bed they had the evening together.  The first few nights they  went to bed early, he might not go  to sleep right away because he was  geared to the other shift, but he'd  hold her and nuzzle her neck and  love her slowly and softly, then  hold her and whisper until she fell  asleep, warm and safe, feeling his  skin fill the empty bed.  After the kids left for school on  days, she would start the wash, tidy  up, then get the taxi and maybe go  down to the CoOp when it opened.  The prices made your hair stand on  end, but what else do you do, drive  nearly a hundred miles, part of it  over a road so rough and dangerous  it doesn't even count as a fire access road in case the bush flared?  The CoOp wasn't really a CoOp anyway.  Oh, they had a meeting now and  again, but they had packers and you  didn't mark your own prices on  things like in a regular CoOp and  maybe you got dividends back at the  end of the year but it sure didn't  make up for the high prices, some  things nearly double what they were  outside, but just try to get outside;  it was like saying rice was cheaper  in China than in Tahsis...so you're  going to go to China to get two  pounds of rice? The CoOp was all  there was; in a company town the  company takes care of you, but it  can keep out any competition, too,  so they got you one way or the other,  coming or going.  She'd go into Tanner's store and  look at the plants and the books.  Shelves of used books, you could  trade your old ones for other used  ones, or, if you didn't have any to  trade, you could buy used books  cheaper than new ones. And the  place was nice, you felt good in  there. Mostly it was a catalogue  outlet where you picked up your  parcels and handed in your orders,  but Dawn had added other things, too  because the catalogue part alone  didn't pay enough to make it worthwhile staying open, and she had  plants and macrame hangers and she  always had a smile and a bit of  conversation for you.  The real book store was mostly  science fiction and magazines. The  science fiction was good, especially Ray Bradbury, he had a mind  like a patchwork quilt and it was  fun to examine each patch one at a  time, book by book.  But you get  tired of it after a while, god,  you were out of touch enough with  the real world without reading  about other planets. Vancouver  was another planet! And God, some  of those magazines. Two different  ones just for gay men! Make you  laugh, those bunkhouses full of  bearded, rough, tough, beer drinking, swearing and fighting men,  and enough of them to make it  \?orthwhile bringing in these magazines with the pictures of dewy  eyed boy-men with smooth bodies and  their pricks showing, of course  their pricks showing, looking either  stiffly obvious or limp and useless  and really very funny.  She wondered how many men knew how much women  snickered about the funny looking  thing the men were so proud of. Even  Ken, although she'd never tell him,  it looked like a peanut with a hat  on it. And magazines with grossly  posed women turning everything dirty,  at least Playboy took good pictures  and made legs look like something  worth having, not things to turn  your stomach.  Sitting spraddle legged on a stool, peeling apples, as  if anybody ever would!  Spraddle legged and showing everything, damp and spread and looking  like something you'd find under a  rock. A lot of the men bought the  stupid things.  She tried to read  one, once, just so she couldn't be  accused of cutting it off without  giving it a chance. Well, you'd  have to be at least a trained acrobatic gymnast to do even half what  they described. An acrobatic gymnast, and mentally ill, too! Four  and five people at one time: like  the old party song 'Argued all  night over who had the right to do  What and with Which and to Whom...'  ...sillyass things.  She used to pick up a Ms. when it  came in and at first she'd go home,  excited, and spend the evening reading it from cover to cover, feeling  that maybe finally someone would  put it all into words for her, but  lately, well...She'd get it and read  it and Ken might tease her a bit,  Hey old woman, don't you get any  idea about burning your bra, huh,  the government would declare a fallout emergency...or he'd say Don't  get so goddam liberated you forget  your friends, eh, and wink and sort  of pat his fly and laugh when she  felt her face going red. Once in  the pub Artie had got a bit nasty,  well, Artie always did when he'd had  a beer or two too many, and he'd  get, like, well if it was a woman  you'd say he got bitchy. And they'd  been talking about maybe trying one  of these groups where the women get  together one night a week without  the kids and everyone has to bring  an article or something that would  be of interest to the whole group,  and nobody can talk about husbands,  kids, or those kind of gossipy problems, but maybe current events or  something. And Artie, he said he'd  go to hell in a piss pot before he  was babysitting so his old lady  could fart around pretending to be  somebody, and everyone was getting  kind of stiff and wondering was  Artie going to start fighting or  something and then Ken, god what a  sense of humour, he said Oh, hell  Artie, don't worry about it, if my  old woman gets her consciousness  raised another inch, I'll need a (over TAHSIS WOMAN (coneI.)  ladder to see it, and everybody  laughed and even Artie calmed down  and relaxed.  But she didn't read Ms. as much now.  All that American politics, and she  couldn't even understand ours let  alone theirs where even the dogcat-  cher changed if a new president got  in.  By the time they had their primaries and their campaign and their  election it would be time for our  election and it seemed like all you  ever got was government people wanting a vote from you, although why  the papers are so full of their politics is a question. Ken said it  was so that when they took over the  whole shiteree we'd know what the  candidates were talking about when  they came up here to get votes to  go to Washington.  And all those articles on Found  Women, well, how did they get LOST,  all those doctors and lawyers and  judges and writers, they didn't  need Found.  Stick out like a sore  thumb in any crowd! How can you  feel lost if you're a woman engineer, building a bridge or something. You felt lost when it was  still two hours from quitting time,  like now, and the whistle was  screaming. Screaming. Screaming.  It meant someone was hurt.  Her uncle had been a rigging sling-  er and he'd been killed at work but  at least the women at home didn't  have to hear the whistle, didn't  have to stand wondering Who...Who  ...didn't know a thing about it  until the minister and the head  push showed up at the door, instead  of him home for supper.  Screaming.  Right now half the  wives in Tahsis...the afternoon  shift wives...would be standing like  she was.  Stiff. Staring. The day-  shift wives would snuggle closer to  their men; even those who hated  their men and a lot of them did,  still they'd cuddle closer, it was  the afternoon shift wives who stood.  Staring. Like her, staring at the  invitation plate, the pickled eggs,  the snack, the pickles that were an  unspoken I Love You, staring, hating  herself for the prayer she was  whispering.  "Dear God, I'll be good, I promise  I'll be good, just don't let it be  Kenny bad hurt or dead, please god,  we want another little girl, and  I'll, be good, I really will, I'll  stopjl smoking and I won't swear,  everj, and just don't let him be  crippled, don't let it be Kenny  with his back smashed, living forever! in a wheelchair and feeling  like! a Nothing. I'll be good, I  realjly will, just don't let it be  Kenny."  Staring, waiting, staring to see who  would come in the door, the charge  hand and the priest, or Kenny coming  toward her knowing she'd been terrified for hours.  Staring at the invitation plate, please god, dear god,  please dear god let someone know  about this so we can be Found Women,  too]...  4ne^  Inez...you got knocked down and raped.

I bet he heard you that time!  —_— cam hubert  ASKING FOR IT  Dessie Woods has been in prison for  almost two years now. On February 2,  1976, she was sentenced to a total  of 22 years in one of the most notorious women's prisons in the south  of the U.S., in Hardwick, Georgia.  Since that time she has been the  victim of brutal beatings, forced  druggings, and nude solitary confinement.  Her crime?  Dessie Woods dared to fight back  against one of the oldest traditions in the southern U.S. - the  white rape of black women. Her assailant, a white insurance salesman  named Ronnie Home, was killed with  his own unlicensed gun, and as it  happens in so many cases, the  victim, Dessie Woods, was made to  be the criminal, and the dead would-  be rapist, the victim.  Dessie Woods would not have met Home  had she not been poor and black. She  was hitch-hiking on a mercy mission,  to demand needed medical attention  for a friend.  After the case of Joan Little, it  had been hoped such cases would diminish. However, that has not been  the case. Third world women such as  Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow and Dessie  Woods are three of the cases which  have gained wide publicity. There  must be many others, which have not.  The U.S.National Committee to Defend  Dessie Woods is located at P.O.Box  92084, Atlanta, Georgia, 30314,USA.  On Wednesday, July 20, an L.A. judge  overturned a decision in a rape case  which had convicted the rapist. The  judge wrote:  "The lone female hitch-hiker, in the  absence of an emergency situation,  as a practical matter, advises all  who pass by that she is willing to  enter the vehicle with anyone who  stops and in so doing advertises  that she has less concern for the  consequences than the average female.  Under such circumstances, it would  not be unreasonable for a man in  the position of the defendant here  to believe that the female would  consent to sexual relations."  "We find it outrageous that a judge  can make such a decision", said  Joan Robbins of the Los Angeles  Commission on Assaults Against  Women. "We feel this decision gives  a green light to men who pick up  female hitch-hikers to assault,  rape or molest them".  West German Protests  There are 35,000 reported rapes every  year in West Germany. Since the first  torchlight anti-rape protest in March  '77, three more women's demonstrations  against violence against women have  occurred.  The demonstrations of May 8 and June  18 were spontaneously organized within 48 hours of reported rapes of individual women in West Berlin.

Sterilization  superprofits for U.S. corporations  will not be threatened by unrest.  (CESA/Big Mama)  US  Puerto Rico has the highest incidence of sterilization in the world.  A 1968 study showed that more than  35% of the women of childbearing  age have been sterilized.  Puerto Rican women are also the  youngest in the world to be sterilized.  Two thirds are between the  ages of 20 and 49.  The key agency  carrying out sterilizations is the  Family Planning Agency of Puerto  Rico.  It receives $750,000 of its  $900,000 budget from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and  Welfare. Unemployment is 30% in  Puerto Rico.  For the U.S. controlling the population of Puerto Rico  is an attempt to divide the country  and limit political unrest so that  Sterilizations in the U.S. have increased at the staggering rate of  1 million a year.  Some 20% of all  Black married women and 25% of Native American women have been sterilized.  New York City Council voted  recently to curb the increasing  incidence of sterilization abuse  in that city.  The new guidelines  require all hospitals and doctors  to wait 30 days after consent forms  - in the patient's native language  - are signed before the operation  is performed.  They also require  that the patient understand that  the operation is permanent. These  guidelines, if implemented, will  curb the population control forces  that promote sterilization as a  permanent method for containing the  birth rate, particularly of Black,  Puerto Rican and other Third World  people in the U.S.  Organizations  sponsored by the U.S. government,  like International Women's Year  Committee, are pushing population  control in the name of "women's  liberation".  At the same time,  continued threats to women's right  to abortion (see last month's Kinesis) force more and more women to  "choose" sterilization. (Guardian)  BC  Women in B.C. are turning to sterilization as a form of birth control  at more than double the rate for men  reversing a trend set in the early  70s.  Figures released by the medical services department in Victoria show  that 10,857 women underwent tubal  ligation in the medical program's  fiscal year ending March 31, 1977,  an increase of 4,500 in the past 6  years.  The figure is double the number of  vasectomies performed on men.  (Vancouver Sun)  Provincial Government  Funding—Rumour and Fact  In last month's Kinesis, all residents of British Columbia received  a flyer mentioning that the provincial government was considering  the establishment of a position within the government which would evaluate women's groups and act as a  liaison person between women's groups  and the government.  Now we learn that the government  of B.C. is considering extending  Rape Relief services to all areas of  the province and, to this end, they  are contemplating setting up a government position to coordinate B.C.  Rape Relief centres. This means that  their plans are somewhat narrower  than we first were given to believe.  This the response from the B.C.  Coalition of Rape Relief centres:  The Coalition of B.C.Rape Relief  Centres would be pleased to receive assistance to extend Rape Relief services throughout the province. However, we emphasize that  we are not prepared to consider the  setting up of a government position  to duplicate work that is already  being done by the Coalition. We  do not wish to spend the taxpayers'  money twice over.  At this time, the Coalition is made  up of women who work co-operatively  out of Kamloops, Vancouver, Victoria  and Nanaimo, and are funded jointly  by the Ministriesof Health, Attorney  General and Human Resources. Chronic  lack of staff and funding make it  impossible to add additional services  without additional monies. Each Rape  Relief staff person is already working an average of 80 hours per week  to meet the needs of the immediate  communities.  Every person who has been sexually  assaulted has the right to information and support. The Coalition of  B.C.Rape Relief Centres expects the  money from the provincial government  to move ahead in providing services  to every person in the province of  British Columbia.

Childbirth:  Is Hospital the Right  Place?  IMMACULATE DECEPTION by Suzanne Arms  Published by San Francisco book Co.  /Houghton Mifflin, 1975  Reviewed by Gina Dougan. Fraser Lake  Women's Centre  How complacent women are. Childbirth  is our own experience.  It happens  rarely to each of us. Yet we have  allowed it to become more rewarding  to debtors and hospital staff than  for ourselves. We allow ourselves  to be; made extremely uncomfortable,  drugged, cut and torn, all of which  is dangerous to ourselves and our  new Babies. We believe we are safe  because it is done in the hallowed  and sterile atmosphere of hospitals  and doctors who are well paid to do  this.  In reading Immaculate Deception, we  see that childbirth is really a normal function of the body of a healthy woman - how physically and psychologically rewarding it is for  both mother and babe, when a child  is born with the help of a sympathetic and qualified midwife and a  woman in control of her body.  According to the author, Ms. Arms,  "Today scientists are beginning to  report evidence that supports what  many women have felt for generations : that where and under what  conditions a woman gives birth  greatly affects the course of her  labour, the normalcy of her delivery, the health of her baby, and  the lifelong relationship of mother  and child.  Women have always felt  a need to find a 'safe' place for  birth, safe from harm and disturbance.  The hospital, we have been  assured, is that safe place.  But we  are beginning to wonder.  "The pregnant woman in America today  actually knows little more about her  coming birth than the child in the  street.  She can probably recount  many stories about other people's  births, including at least one chilling tale of a friend who supposedly  'wouldn't be alive today' if it had  not been for a quick-thinking obstetrician who intervened to save  the day.  But information about what  really goes on inside the hospital  stops at the front door.  In making  this book I have tried to show what  has happened to birth in American  hospitals, what we have lost in our  national push for progress, and what  alternatives to current practice  still exist. Childbirth is one of  the most profound, personal experiences a woman can have.  Yet our  present system of uniform care does  not allow her the freedom to choose  her own way of birth and reclaim the  experience as her own."  After reading this book I felt sad  that it is too late for me to have  enjoyed the births of my own children to the fullest.  But I feel so  glad that my own two daughters will  have this awareness available to  them.  How terrible it is that the  few midwives in America Who have  had the courage to help women with  their birth experiences have been  hounded by sharp tongues and extremely unfair laws.  People aire the masters of their own  destiny and women should be especially so in childbirth.  I hope this  book is made easily available to  all people.  It will make the young  extremely enthusiastic about the  future of the family unit but it  will make older people sad that they  couldn't have done more in the bonding of the family unit.  'T felt sad that it was too late  for me to have enjoyed the  births of my own children  to the fullest."  The Complete Book of Midwifery, by  Barbara Brennan, C.N.M. and Joan  Rattner Heilman (Toronto: Clarke  Irwin, 1977), $5.95.  Reviewed by Jane Evans  It's certainly a tremendously encouraging title, but this book is  not the answer for those who imagine that giving birth with a midwife means giving birth in the  security of one's own home. This  is "the modern woman's guide to a  hospital alternative in childbirth."  Written by a nurse-midwife, it's  a step in the right direction but  some of the old practices of hospital delivery - stirrups, episio-  tomies - are still perpetuated.  While we can see the necessity for  even such things as induced labour  from time to time, our aim should  surely be to get the healthy mother  and child as far away as possible  from the alienation of the stark  hospital atmosphere.  The infant mortality rate in the  U.S. (in spite of the Canadian  publisher, this is an American  book) is significantly higher than  those European countries which rely on the services of trained mid-  wives. Brennan is a nurse midwife  who has received the same obstetrical training as a doctor and is  affiliated with a major U.S. hospital. The practices she describes  are, while not ideal, miles ahead  of anything we have in B.C. Here,  home delivery is against the law,  and a doctor will not attend no  matter what the emergency.  For the pregnant woman who wants the  reassurance of reading about nearly  natural delivery, this is a pleasant  book, but for the real stuff, Leboy-  er's Birth Without Violence or even  dear old Grantly Dick-Read are still  miles ahead.

Note: This is a new  book, forthcoming in August.  A feminist analysis of rape; includes discussion of who rapes, why  rapes occur, the social rules of  rape, and a historical analysis of  rape.  LOCAL INFORMATION  "A Study of Rape in Canada: phases  C, D, and E", A Report to the Donner  Foundation, Loreene M. G. Clark and  Debra Lewis (Centre of Criminology,  University of Toronto), 205 pp., 1977.  The research studies 378 of a total  420 rape cases reported to the Vancouver Police Department between  1970 and 1974.  The report examines  victims, offenders, and treatment  by the judicial system. They conclude that major attitudinal and  legislative changes must occur if  there is any hope of getting more  victims to report offences and more  offenders convicted.  CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE  "The Treatment of Rape and Rape Victims within the Canadian Criminal  Justice System: Failure, Facts, and  Theory", Centre of Criminology, University of Toronto, 64 pp., 1977.  Report studies reported rape cases  to the Metropolitan Toronto Police  Department. This report examines  the whole process from reporting a  rape to conviction.  They conclude  "what is clear from this data is  that there is a bias which operates  throughout the entire criminal justice system to ensure that some and  only some rape cases will be prosecuted (p. 29)." This is an excell-  analysis of rape and the "dismal  failure of the Canadian criminal  justice system (p. 4)."  FORTHCOMING - WORTHWHILE  RAPE: The Price of Coercive Sexuality, Loreene M. G. Clark and Debra  Lewis, September 1977.  The empirical data is based on  rapes reported to the Toronto  Police Department in 1970. This  is an excellent Canadian analysis  on rape. They emphasize that rape  is a physical assault and not a  sexual offence and that the Criminal Code should definitely be  amended.  Rationalization of Sexual Offences  in the Criminal Code, Advisory Council on the Status of Women, Box 1541,  Station B, Ottawa, KIP 5R5 (Sept.  22/76)  "Present legislation regarding rape  and other sexual offences even with  recent amendments, does not fully  reflect societal norms, nor does  it ensure the individual autonomy,  self-determination and self-respect  to which we believe every individual is entitled. Without further  reform of the Criminal Code relating to sexual offences, the rights  and interests of neither victim  nor accused can be upheld (p. 3)."  Recommendations are made for amending the Criminal Code. Worthwhile  for getting acquainted with the  Criminal Code.

Members  Racism and Sexism  Raise Their Ugly Heads  June 28: Ms. Pat Jordan (North  Okanagan) of Rosemary Brown (Vancouver-Burrard) : "I wonder why that  member doesn't go back to Jamaica!"  June 16:  Charles Barber (Victoria)  speaking of the Social Credit hiring of three women as tourist counsellors for the Marguerite: 'The  point of this hiring was to place  aboard the Marguerite three young  women in attractive costumes who,  with bright smiles and winsome looks  would proceed to talk to the tourists...all of which sound very good."  June 29: Premier Bennett: "Although  the member for Burnaby North (Eileen  Dailly) is one of the members that  is worthwhile looking at on the other side of the House..."  Sex Discrimination in Schools  On June 23, the Leader of the P.C.  Party, the Hon.Scott Wallace, questioned Education Minister McGeer:  "...Can the Minister tell the House  where he has on his staff any person  or persons actively involved in initiating studies or making recommendations on the subject of sex discrimination in the schools, and if  so, what has been accomplished?"  Hon. Mr. McGeer: "The answer to the  question is yes, it's a concern of  the whole curriculum development  division.  It's a policy of the provincial government to address itself  to any questions of sexual discrimination that occur in the schools  and we are actively prusuing the  problem. Now I must add, Mr. Speaker, that of the some 300 pieces of  mail that arrive each day in the  Ministry office, in the past year,  coming across my desk, there has  not been one single written complaint. .."  As Scott Wallace later produced a  carbon copy of a letter to McGeer  from VSW complaining about sexism  in school texts, McGeer must have  been telling at least something less  than the truth.  Sexism in education is a widely documented fact of which any educational  professional should be aware.  Human  rights officers are now investigating blatant examples of sex discrimination in Lower Mainland schools.  McGeer's dismissal of sexism as a  non-problem, on the very day he was  being lobbied by a province-wide  coalition of concerned women, is  outrageous. Write McGeer and tell  him bo. Send Scott Wallace a copy.  ALSO, WRITE SCOTT WALLACE AND THANK  HIM FOR HIS SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE.  Women and Pornography  On June 23, Rosemary Brown (NDP, Vancouver-Burrard) spent some time questioning Attorney General Garde Gardom  on the subject of pronography. As  chief law enforcement officer, the  Attorney General, said Ms. Brown,  should accept some responsibility.  The basic point made by Brown was  that pornography has become closely  linked with violence, and that the  entertainment industry is making a  mint out of violence against women.  "...I think the thing that really  alarms us is the whole nexus between pornography and violence. It's  passed out of the phase now where  it's simply a matter of exploiting  women's bodies; it's reached intc  the arena where they're being exploited in a violent way...if pornography was just a private fantasy  publicly shared, we could probably  say to ourselves: 'Let us leave it  alone.  It's a bunch of dirty-minded old men having fun...if they're  that stupid, let them at it.'  But  it's not that any more.  It's in  the public arena now.  Those of us  who are women, and those of us who  are the parents of women or the  grandparents of women, have to demand more from that Attorney General than this...I demand on behalf  of my sisters...that the Attorney  General do something about this  filth linked with violence which  is degrading us...in this province."  WRITE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, GARDE  GARDOM, AND DEMAND THAT HE TAKE ACTION TO CURB THE FLOW OF MEDIA VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.  the Injustice System  On June 23, Rosemary Brown (NDP,  Vancouver-Burrard) asked the Attorney General, Garde Gardom, to address  the problems of women within the  prison system in B.C. She began by  pointing out the lack of any real  vocational and rehabilitative services for women in prison.  "...  When I visited prisons right here  in the Lower Mainland, In one prison there was a couple of sewing  machines and that was all. Absolutely no attempt had been made to  help these women complete their  education (26% of these women in  prison have less than a Grade 8  education, only 6% have finished  high school)...Most of the women  in Oakalla were native Indian women, and most of them...were in  there on drug-related charges...  All of them were poor...I found  that 46% of. them were under age 25.  "Why do so many of the prostitutes  end up being incarcerated and so  few of the men who use the services  of these prostitutes ever get called  to justice?  "There is something basically wrong  with the system...(Another) thing  that really bothered me was what  happened to the babies born to a  number of these women who were in  prison...if there wasn't a family  unit that was ready and willing to  take the child...then the child disappeared into the whole network of  the welfare bureaucracy...  Provincially  THE MAJOR DISASTER IN TEE LEGISLATURE  recently is reported upon at length  in other sections of this month's  Kinesis. This is Bill 65, the Bill  which would, if passed, abolish to  Vancouver Resources Board. Gordon  Gibson (Leader, Liberal), Scott  Wallace (Leader, P.C.) and members  of the N.D.P. are united in their  opposition to this Bill.  r-  picture: Members of the Province-  Wide Education Lobby which met with  McGeer to give him some CR on sexism recently.  "The other thing that really terrifies me was when I read the Solicitor General's statistics that indicated that between January 1970 and  December 1973 there was a 179% increase in the number of women ending  up in prison." That number represents an increase in trafficking,  possession and prostitution. Half  of the 4,000 people sent to prison  each year are Incarcerated for crimes  against property, not against people.  Brown also alluded to the lack of  grievance procedures for women prisoners, the lack of adequate physical and mental health care.  Rosemary Brown called for "an advisory council of concerned women who.,  will deal with the whole issue concerning women in the prisons,  the  whole business of vocational training, educational training and the  whole justice system as it applies  to women."  VSW SUPPORTS THE SETTING UP OF SUCH A  COMMITTEE. WRITE TO THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL, GARDE GARDOM, AND URGE THAT  HE CREATE SOME MEANINGFUL JOB TRAINING AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES FOR  WOMEN WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM.  Rape in B.C.  On June 22, Rosemary Brown (NDP,  Vancouver-Burrard) asked the Attorney General, Garde Gardom, for some  "real commitment to the unified  family court in terms of money",  and for up-to-date statistics on  how many rape cases went through  the courts and how they were disposed of.  Gardom responded with a summary of  his government's actions in the  area of rape relief. He mentioned  the funding of the coalition of  rape relief centres ($125,000).  He also alluded to the 1976 changes  in the criminal code, which will  allow for "closed hearings in rape  cases, changes of venue, restrictions on the publication of the  woman's name in newspaper, and  restriction in cross-examination  of the woman about prior sexual  conduct." Further, he cited the  educational project in rape prevention, for which $15,000 has been  raised.  WRITE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, GARDE  GARDOM, AND EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT  RAPE IS ASSAULT AND SHOULD BE  TREATED AS SUCH. While the restriction of cross-examination is  a progressive proposal, any moves  to make rape trials "Hush, Hush"  further confuse the issue and add  to the sexist notion that women  should be ashamed of being raped. Meanwhile,  Back in Ottawa  The Federal Government has just  passed Bill C-24. This amends the  Immigration Act in an extremely oppressive way. Also, this session,  they amended the UIC regulations  and made it more difficult for workers to qualify for benefits.  Both  measures make like even tougher  for ordinary people in Canada, both  are indicative of the fact that, as  the economy worsens, those in power  will attempt to shift the burden  of crisis on to the backs of the  general populace.  New Immigration Ac  Bill C 24 means that:  * there is no restriction on the  arbitrary conditions an immigration  officer can set when people enter  Canada. They can be deported for  any viclations. (Section 14)  * immigrants will be photographed  and fingerprinted by immigration  without committing any offence.  (Section 111.2)  * immigration and police will not  need a warrant to arrest immigrants,  just on "suspicion".  (Sec. 104.2)  * the state will be able to detain  immigrants for indefinite periods  of time without bringing them to  court trial. (Sec. 104.3)  * the state will be able to require  Canadian citizens and residents to  19  obtain exit visas before leaving  the country. (Sec. 115)  ANY person, including a Canadian  itizen, can be compelled to provide  the state with ANY information "required"  (pertaining to immigrants  or immigration) , or face jail and  fines. (Section 95)  * any immigrant may be deported for  political reasons on the basis of  a SECRET report (Sec. 40.1) WITHOUT  APPEAL.  * immigrants may be deported simply  on SUSPICION that they are associated  with any organization that is "LIKELY"  to engage in acts of violence (Sec.  19.lg)  NO PROOF NECESSARY.  * immigrants may be deported if the  state considers that they are "LIKELY"  while in Canada, to actively support  the struggles against dictatorships  in their homelands or ANY other country.

The Family  in The New Society  The latest publication of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women  (ACSW) has been getting lots of flak.  The booklet is called The Family in  the New Society. According to newspaper reports, the issues the book  exposes - the rising divorce rates,  discrimination against women and  wives, and the available alternatives  to the nuclear family, are considered  too "negative" by the majority of  council members.  The One-parent Family  The vice-chairperson, Win Loewen, has  been quoted as saying that "the  majority of council members felt  it was not a positive representation  of the family."  598  ^LOG-l/'  y&r  r^tiJ)  The Communal Family .  It's very hard to imagine what the  fuss can be about.  The booklet carries a section on the Liberators,  Controllers and Preservers of the  nuclear family. The Preservers -  The Childless Couple  Illustrations by Madeleine Beaudry.  the Aiders and Abettors are television, and the education system:  "Television is perhaps the worst  offender for in the majority of  'family' shows, women are shown in  traditional roles...The second worst  preserver of bygone attitudes is to  be found in our educational system."  The Traditional Family  The booklet contends that the right  to be married should be accompanied  by an equal right not to remain married.  There has been no new divorce  reform since 1968, it comments, and  lists seven desired reforms.  The section concludes: "There is  little evidence to support the contention that children are better off  in a two-parent unhappy home than in  a well-adjusted, economically stable  one-parent home and the current  myths to this effect should be dispelled."  Like other publications in this ACSW  'person papers' series, the booklet  contains many interesting statistics.  For example, in 1975, for families  headed by women, the average income  was $6,389.  In 1974, for families  headed by men, the average income was  $15,529.  In addition, the booklet outlines  various lifestyles - the childless  couple, the one-parent family, the  traditional family, the communal  family, the common-law family.  "The family headed by a woman alone  with all the attendant psychological and emotional problems, is the  most disadvantaged unit in Canada."  LIMITED COPIES AVAILABLE AT VSW  illus. from the book  K.C.I.A.—Rape  SUPPORT GROUP IN JAPAN AIDS KOREAN  ■WOMAN RAPED BY KCIA  New York (LNS)—Korean residents of  Japan have formed a support group  to help publicize the case of a  Korean woman tortured and raped by  the Korean CIA (KCIA), the Pak Jung  Hi regime's secret police recently  implicated in the bribery of U.S.  Congress members.  The woman, 27-year-old Kwon Mai Ja,  was born in Japan, where there is  a substantial Korean minority as a  result of Japanese domination of  the Korean peninsula from 1910 to  1945. Kwon went to South Korea to  learn the language and customs of  her people, but was kidnapped by  KCIA agents in August, 1975.  Kwon was held prisoner for ten days.  After hearing the KCIA discussing  whether to kill her if she refused  to give names, she finally signed  an 'affidavit' they had prepared  as evidence in the 'spy case'.  Kwon Mai Ja was tortured repeatedly  and frequently threatened with rape  and other sexual abuses by members  of the KCIA, who sometimes removed  all their clothes for the torture  sessions.  After she was released, one of the  agents followed her home to her  apartment in Seoul. He then as^-  saulted and raped her, at the same  time promising that "you will never  be taken to the CIA and your human  rights will be guaranteed."  Kwon emphasizes that her case is not  unique; "A great many, indeed, had  similar experiences. They were tortured and humiliated.

While discussion raged within the  women's movement, Claudia's third  and final hearing took place, April  15. Nicola Vinciprova, the youth  who had first befriended Claudia,  was charged only with public ob-  secenity, not rape, because Claudia  had agreed to go with him on a  bike-ride. Another, equally  significant slap in the face for  women was the abhorrent defense  made on behalf of the boys, reflecting the social mentality  women are up against. Their lawyers stated, "My clients didn't  know such sexual acts were against  the law.'" ; "My client was the  last. If he'd refused, they would  have thought he was impotent."  "Boys will be boys and when a  girl likes to go out and have a  good time, she has to expect  trouble." The concluding lawyer  accused Claudia of having a phallic  fetish...  When Claudia was released from hospital on April 21, she escaped into  hiding because she feared for her  life. It was her employer, Vito  Gemma, who had set up the second  rape in order to terrorize her into  keeping quiet about the prostituion.  During the eight months she had been  in Gemma's house, he had forced her,  and other young women, to take part  in cruel sexual orgies. One woman  had gone blind after being violently  beaten up.  The grotesque details of the case  only reinforce the more squalid  circumstances of women's oppression.  A single court case will not change  this reality, nor will a campaign  to end prostitution. Feminists must  fight to end violence in the streets,  at home and in the work place by  fighting on all fronts to create  an economic system which will provide socially productive lives for  women and men. •  FRAME UP  The murder trial of two Filipina  nurses, LEONIE PEREZ and FILIPINA  (P.I. ) NARCISO concluded recently.  Both women have been convicted on  two counts of murder, seven of attempted poisoning, one of conspiracy to poison, stemming from a  rash of mysterious deaths at the  Ann Arbor Veterans Hospital in the  summer of 1975. The prosecution  admits to having only circumstantial evidence, many of the 70 odd  government witnesses have been unable to corroberate the prosecution's version of events, one state  witness claims she was offered immunity from the same charges plus  a job promotion if she testified  against Narciso and Perez, the  Hospital's Chief Pathologist testified that one of the victims had  none of the poison Pavulon in his  liver or blood and the other victim's autopsy report was unexplain-  edly missing, both women have impeccable professional records, and  most recently come to light, is a  psychiatrist's report that Nursing  Supervisor Betty Jakim confessed  to the killings before she committed  suicide in February. Everything in  their case indicates that Narciso  and Perez are victims of a truly  criminal justice system that's look-  Mozambique (cont.)  from page 8  of their husbands and children and  exploited them at work.  Colonialism very often left prostitution  as the only means of livelihood.  This feeling of inferiority holds  women back from participating in  meetings and even family discussions  - in front of their husbands and  children, women feel unable to express their own opinions.  Their  inhibitions and lack of initiative  in turn produce an inability to  take on responsible jobs or to  break away from this conditioning.  Women whose feelings of inferiority  and dependence in relation to men  are deeply embedded, are incapable  of conceiving of life without men.  SINGLE MOTHERS AND DIVORCED WOMEN  Single mothers are frequently isolated, and when they do not have  the necessary technical skills to  get a job to provide for themselves  and their children, the preconditions for prostitution are fulfilled.  The divorced woman, like the single  mother, is isolated in our society,  regardless of the causes of her situation. Whether or not she has  children, the only recourse open to  the abandoned wife is prostitution  or servitude either in her family  household or in a new union.  The  abandoned wife will go and live with  the first man who will accept her  because she is afraid of being a-  lone. There is a tendency for such-  men to exploit her, treating her no  more than a servant with children.  The OMM must encourage women to win  their economic independence.  This  is the basis for their affirmation  as useful people, capable of fulfillment within society.  FINAL CONSIDERATIONS  The OMM must realize that the ideological campaign should be persistent and continuous.  The material  conditions must be created whereby  women can liberate themselves from  their enslaved condition.  The Second Conference believes that the  communal villages and cooperatives  provide such a basis, because through  them women can be integrated into  collective work. They will have  the same duties and rights as men,  and the product of their labour will  benefit themselves and the community.  (From Union Wage)  ing for a scapegoat in twe Third  World women who are foreign to the  workings of the American legal system« How to Survive  on UIC  "When dealing with the Unemployment  Insurance Commission you can never  say definitely what is going on."  So says Allan MacLean, a lawyer with  the Vancouver Community Legal Assistance Society.  But officials of the Commission  answer that people claiming benefits  (claimants) often don't pay attention  to the informational material the  Commission provides in six languages.  Tony Strachan, an information officer  for the UIC, complains that the gutters outside Commission offices are  often strewn with this material.  Wherever the truth may lie, it's safe  to say that applying for unemployment benefits can be baffling.  First question: who can get benefits?  According to the present legislation  you have to work and pay premiums for  at least eight weeks to be eligible.  (Bill C-27, now before Parliament,  would stretch this period to twelve  weeks.)  But you must have been working in what is called "insurable employment", and this is decided not  by the Unemployment Insurance Commission but by the Department of  National Revenue.  Government sponsored make-work projects are particularly tricky in  this regard. There was the sad case  of a young couple who worked on a  government sponsored project a few  years ago, paid premiums, then collected benefits after the project  terminated.  They were ordered by  UIC to pay back $3,000 when National  Revenue decided that the job was not  "insurable".  You are not eligible for unemployment  insurance if you are self-employed  or employed by your spouse. Nor are  you eligible if you are 65 or older.  It is your employer's responsibility  to deduct your premiums from your pay  cheque.  When you want to claim for benefits  you can pick up the application kit  at your nearest UIC office. The  kit contains various pamphlets which  you should not throw in the gutter.  According to MacLean, you should be  very carefuly in filling out the application form. If, for example,  you have quit your job, and your  explanation for quitting is not  satisfactory as far as UIC offic-  Woman in Unemployment Office  The June unemployment figures for  B.C. are out:  for men, 6.7% and  for women, 9.7%.  ials are concerned, you can lose  up to six weeks of benefits. That  is, they will disqualify you from  money for six weeks if they think  you quit qithout "just cause".  "For example," says MacLean, "if  your doctor told you that you would  definitely have a nervous breakdown  if you stayed on at a certain job,  that's probably just cause.  If  you quit because you don't like  the colour of your office, that  probably is not."  According to the law, your former  employer has five days from your  last day of work to provide you  with your Record of Employment  Certificate, your "separation slip".  This certificate tells the Commission how much money you were making  and how long you worked.  Since  you will get about 66% of your weekly earnings in benefits, the Commission needs to know how much you  earned in a typical week.  If, for some reason, you don't have  the certificate when you are ready  to file your claim, file anyway.  Since there is a two-week waiting  period for every claimant, the important thing is for you to establish your claim first; worry about  the details during the waiting  period.  But keep after your ex-  boss to give you your Record of  Employment.  Next Month: Regular, Sickness and  Maternity Benefits.

(Handicapped Persons  Income Assistance). Those recipients who live in subsidized or  institutionalized housing now receiving a mere $265 a month have  had no increase since January 1976  although cost of living index has  increased since that time.  2. The Income Assistance $40 shelter overage recently announced by  the Minister, brings non-subsidized housing recipients "up to the  'potential' monthly income of $305;  those who are between ages 60 to  64 must pay 25% of this '$40 shelter overage' themselves I"  3. Of the $40 shelter overage promised by the Minister on July 1,  1977, 25% of it must be paid out of  the recipient's $175 monthly income.  4. Recipients of Income Assistance  must endure a 4 month waiting period  before qualifying for $40 rental overage. This applies across the board:  singles, couples, and families.  5. The October 1, 1976 substantial  cutbacks to the hanicapped were not  restored until July 1, 1977 (nothing  retroactive), despite Minister's  assurances to the contrary.  6. The GAIN (formerly Mincome)  Legislation Section 8 which allows  cost of living indexing in the Act  has NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.  Minister  states matter "has been under study"  since September 1976!  C.O.L. increase since mid-1975 has risen 27%.  7. Promise of "Universal Pharmacare"  has not been fulfilled.  Benefits  do not accrue until first $100 per  year are paid. What about working  poor who make $3.00 an hour? Also o  it does not cover needles for dia-a-  betics, asprins for arthritics,etc;c.  8. Despite urgent pleading, residential hotels and boarding houses  in metropolitan core areas of B.C.  cities are not covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act. Tenants have  NO RENT CONTROL PROTECTION. Some  pay $115 out of $175 income for rent!  9. Vancouver City Council's recommended basic social welfare income  is $230 (single), $340 (couples) -  compared to present Human Resources  $175 (single), $300 (couples).  10. "Welfare Fraud", "Freeloaders"  ...No objective studies reveal more  than 3% of social welfare recipients  "ripping off the system". The Minister of Human Resources admits to  no knowledgeable study, either.  11. Contradiction:  The Premier  publicly champions the guaranteed  adequate income for all Canadians;  the Minister of Human Resources  publicly disagrees and continues  "piecemeal", "means test", "investigative", "guilty until proven  innocent" policies toward public  recipients of the province.  12. The Minister of Human Resources  repetitively boasts about the  $100,000,000 "surplus" his policies,  through underspending, have "saved"  the taxpayers of B.C.  In truth,  it has been at the expense of hungry people. From a brief by the First  United  Church. FAPG Newsletter 6/77 'ĢraoRe LetteRs  Dear Ms. Allen:  Thank you very much for your letter  of June 27, 1977 with regard to Mr.  McGeer's inadequate answer to my  question in the Legislature the  other day, regarding his Department's ignoring of sexism in the  Department of Education.  It was  particularly galling to me to be  told that in the course of the  past year, he has not received a  single letter of complaint on this  subject. As you mention, you yourself have written letters to Mr.  McGeer and one of the ladies who  was in attendance in the Gallery of  the Legislature that day, also  showed me copies of two letters  which had been sent to the Minister.  I would very much appreciate being  kept informed of all the information  you have on this subject. As you  may be aware, we have not yet debated1 the financial estimates of  the Department of Education and  since that debate presents me with  a much better opportunity to question the Minister in depth, than  does the daily Question Period, I  would be most appreciative if you  could provide me with any specific  examples which would- clearly prove  the Minister's indifference to what  is a very important issue.  Thank you again for taking the  trouble to write and, as I repeat  I would be most grateful for any  further specific examples on which  I could base questions and criticisms for the important debate which  will take place on Education within  the next two or three weeks.  Yours sincerely,  G. Scott Wallace, MLA  Leader, Progressive  Conservative Party of  British Columbia  Editor's note: Scott Wallace will  be resigning soon.  Write to him now  and thank him for his consistent  support in the Legislature.  KINESIS:  This is the best feminist publication I know. Due to lack of time,  I've had to narrow the scope of my  reading and I count on Kinesis to  keep me informed of developments.  Keep up the excellent work!  Andrea Davis  North Vancouver  1  KINESIS:  We want to express our appreciation  for Kinesis - an extremely important  feminist newsletter and one that  must be among the most useful and  informative of the many feminist publications . We also want to support  your current drive to make Kinesis  more widely available in the community through community centres,  laundromats, etc.  It is because Kinesis is so important that we want to raise a problem  that seems to us signficant both  for the newsletter and for the women  and women's groups who contribute  to Kinesis and who read it.  We have noticed that there frequently is nc acknowledgement of the sources of information or the authorship  of articles that appear in Kinesis.  In two cases recently, this related  to us directly. In one issue, information that appeared on a pamphlet  prepared and distributed by the Council on Household Employment and the  Women's Research Centre was reprinted  word for word, although neither group  was acknowledged. In another issue,  an article on child care appeared that  was based almost entirely on information supplied by Cath Alperovitz  of our staff, although she was not  credited.  We feel it is important that women's  work be recognized and credited, most  particularly in a feminist publication.  In so many other areas it is not. It  is taken for granted, or it is subsumed by or credited to others. Or,  it is simply anonymous.  It is important too that women who  read Kinesis begin to get a sense  of the extent of women's work, that  they see that many women are doing  many things - that groups like  the Council on Household Employment  are beginning to break new ground.  Your newsletter reflects the situation of women in many countries and  many situations; it should reflect  as well and women and groups who are  doing something about it.  Sincerely,  B.Gene Errington  Co-ordinator  Women's Research Centre  45 Kingsway, Vancouver.  Editor's note: This is a just criticism. In the future,  every attempt will  be made to acknowledge information  sources more rigorously.  Articles referred, to appeared on p. 1  of Vol6,#6 and p.23 of Vol 6,U,  KINESIS:  My subscription plus a bit!!  Sounds  like you need all the help you can  get so I'm canvassing the women at  work for you.  Good luck and please  don't fold.  I can distribute in my  apartment building and a few at work  if that helps.  Susan P. King-Wilson  Vancouver  I strongly disagree with remarks  made by L. Zeldowicz in her/his  letter to Kinesis. We live in such  an incredibly sexist society, and  are just beginning to realize and  examine the sexist value systems  and vocabulary around us. We cannot have enough material via all  vehicles, like Kinesis, to help us  notice and respond to the sex-role  stereotyping around us. After  reading articles and books on the  subject, and with seven years of  experiencing sexism in our educational system, as a teacher, I myself am only now beginning to feel  that I can see exactly how broad  any definition of sexism must be,  and indeed how wide its societal  ripples are. ' I feel that such intensive and continual examination  of sexism is necessary before and  certainly during the period where  we try to smash sexist social and  economic hierarchies.  Ideally,  'exploitation of sexism for business promotion should obviously be  condemned and opposed' but it takes  oodles of consciousness-raising to  have us realize and recognize this  mind warp through advertising, and  again further reflection and thought-  change to organize to fight this  sexism.  I really am not sure that  I could have come to the above realizations had it not been for excellent, thought-provoking articles  such as are found in Kinesis.  In further disagreement, perhaps  as Zeldowicz suggests, I am being  naive and simplistic; but I breathed a giant sigh of relief after  reading in Kinesis and in the Hite  report, that other women, indeed  many other women use masturbation  as one form of sexual satisfaction  and a means of relieving inner tension. We are so uptight about our  sexuality; we have had such few  chances to explore our feelings and  our bodies; and many of the limited  'facts' given to us are now being  shown as untrue; that we desperately need more chances to explore the  many ways we express our human sexuality.  Feminist publications, such  as Kinesis, provide one such chance,  especially to persons living in remoter areas lacking opportunities  for discussion.  I strongly urge the editorial board  of Kinesis to keep up the unbelievably excellent job they have been  doing.  I welcome each issue of Kinesis and read the many articles with  great interest; and do consider this  reading part of my developing-as-a-  feminist-person process. Thank you  for allowing me to ramble on. This  letter of support for the content of  Kinesis is very long overdue.  As for Zeldowicz's definition of  lesbianism as "an infrequent variant of sexual behavior" with no  special needs, that remark must be  treated with the contempt that it  deserves...
