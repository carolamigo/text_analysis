Report from Kuala Lumpur 5  Female gazes  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999 As Kinesis goes to press, the United  Nations has reprimanded Canada on its  "poor" record in reducing poverty. The  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights released its concluding observations on Canada's Third Report.  The National Association of Women  and the Law says the Committee draws attention to the failure of Canadian governments to ensure pay equity, to provide adequate legal aid coverage for women's legal issues, and to remove obstacles to support women escaping domestic violence.  The Committee also chastized Canada  for continuing the discrimination against  Aboriginal women regarding the division  of matrimonial property upon divorce. And  it noted the impact of the Canada Health  and Social Transfer was particularly harsh  on women, especially single mothers.  On the subject of pay equity: a federal  court of appeal has ruled in favour of employees at Bell Canada. Essentially, the appeal court stated it was appropriate for the  Canadian Human Rights Commission to  have handled the case. Despite the ruling,  the federal government appears to have no  intention of dropping its appeal of the  CHRC tribunal ruling in the Public Service  Alliance Canada's pay equity complaint.  More on poverty in Canada... the five  big banks certainly don't have to worry  about that. All of them—Royal Bank, Scotia  Bank, Bank of Montreal, Toronto Dominion and CIBC—tallied profits of more than  $1 billion this past year. Topping the money  scales was the Royal, which again broke its  own record profit level, this time bringing  home $1.82 billion. Poor, poor CIBC  though. It dropped from second place to  fifth, scoring only $1.06 billion.  The much awaited internal RCMP inquiry into the murders of Rajwar Ghakal  and eight members of her family by her estranged husband in April 1996 has been  completed. Last month, the RCMP released  the inquiry report, written by Josiah Wood,  and announced some policy and protocol  changes. Kinesis will have an analysis of the  outcome in our February issue.  Speaking of inquiries, the RCMP/  APEC public inquiry may be back up and  running soon, following the resignation of  Solicitor General Andy Scott. Scott stepped  down after he was caught being too forthcoming about the case in mid-air. (He  should have watched the in-flight movie  instead.) Readers who want to make financial contributions in support of the APEC  protesters can send donations c/o the BC  Federation of Labour, 4279 Canada Way,  Burnaby, BC, V5G 1H1.  Hey, hey. Gloria Steinem is once again  at the helm of Ms. Magazine. Steinem, the  founder and first editor of the 27-year old  magazine, is among a group of investors  (collectively called Liberty Media for  Women) that recently bought Ms. back from  MacDonald Communications. The selling  price: oh, a mere US$3 to $4 million.  One last thing: in the story on exposing the tactics of "fathers' rights" groups  [page 10] in our November issue, we said  Kinesis would follow up on a comment  made by Senator Anne Cools that Erin  Pizzey was doing research on domestic violence for the Canadian Senate. We found  out that Pizzey didn't do any research work  for the Joint House/Senate Committee on  Child Custody and Access or the Canadian  Senate directly; rather, Cools had hired  Pizzey on a short-term contract to do some  research for her. The contract is over now.  That's all for this month. Hope you  enjoy the first of our 25th anniversary issues. Take care.  Corrections  In the special supplement on violence against women in our November issue, the  photo credit for the shot of Take Back the Night in Calgary [page 15] appears to have  fallen off the edge of the flats. The credit should have been given to Julie Black. Also, in  that issue, we incorrectly described the contents of Mary Billy's Femicide List on page 16.  We noted that the entire list is in alphabetical order when, in fact, it is only the master list  of names that is in alphabetical order. Apologies all around.

The financial situation of  NAC is extremely precarious, thanks in  large part to stalling by the minister responsible for advancing the status of women.  Already running a $100,000 deficit,  creditors are knocking at NAC's doors. Essentially, the organization is functioning  without funds. The reason? NAC has yet  to receive approval of its funding request  from Status of Women Canada (SWC).  NAC's president Joan Grant-  Cummings says that, since February, the  organization has put in three applications  to SWC. Two have been rejected, and the  third is still in limbo. Although NAC raises  70 percent of its annual budget through its  own fundraising, Grant-Cummings says  the monies NAC receives from Status—  around $250,000 a year—covers about four  months worth of work.  SWC rejected NAC's first application  because NAC refused to comply with the  new Women's Program funding guidelines,  introduced for this current fiscal year. Under the new funding arrangement, there is  no more "program" (core) funding, only  "project" funding.  NAC maintains the new criteria are  detrimental to women's groups and an attempt to control the agenda and work of  the women's movement. The minister responsible for the status of women, Hedy  Fry, counters that the new criteria is more  flexible than it used to be.  NAC is not the only women's organization that has been adversely affected by  the change in Women's Program funding.  Several women's groups in Newfoundland  and Quebec, for example, had difficulty  getting their applications approved until  several months into the fiscal year.  In August, NAC applied for a project  grant to examine the "impact of SWC's  funding policies on women's organizations." Fry says SWC turned down the application because it would be a "conflict of  interest" for Status to fund a recipient organization to evaluate the "funder." NAC  was also told it was too early in the game  to evaluate the new funding criteria, even  though many women's groups across the  country have told SWC that the new guidelines create major problems for them.  NAC then sent in a revised application  in late September, this time with a broader  scope: to look at the "impact of the Liberal  government's economic policies on women's organizations and on women in general, in the context of equality rights." SWC  staff promised NAC a one-week turnaround response. Two months later, SWC  is still reviewing NAC's application.  NAC is calling on women to press Prime  Minister Jean Chretien, Finance Minister Paul  Martin, Treasury Board president Marcel  Masse, and Status of Women Canada minister  Hedy Fry to approve NAC's funding proposal,  and to rescind the current SWC funding criteria and provide core funding to women's groups  in Canada. NAC welcomes all donations, which  can be sent to NAC, 203-234 Eglinton Avenue  East, Toronto, Ontario, M4P 1K5.

It our December/January issue feels a bit thicker than usual, that's because it is. We couldn't help it. Our special  supplement on 25 years of the women's  movement in Canada [starting on page 9]  just kept growing. As a consequence, we  went to press a bit later than planned.  You many also have noticed that some  of the pages are shinier. Okay, we confess:  we went with a "higher" quality newsprint  for our centrespread poster and cover  pages, so they would stand out more.  Another thing to report... We are finally  launching our very own website. Initially,  we were aiming for a January 1st "live date"  (see, we're learning the lingo), but now it  looks more like mid-January Check it out  then—http://www.web.net/kinesis.  We would like to welcome the new  voices to the pages of Kinesis: Louise  Shaughnessy, Audrey Huntley, Nisibilada  Mercy Thomas, Amal Rana, Bernadette  Phan and Tanis Phillips. We also welcome  Joanna Frayne, Audrey Huntley and  Bernadette Phan, who joined us in the production room for the first time this month.  And, we send a warm goodbye to  Claudia Deutschland, who just completed  her six-week internship at Kinesis. Claudia  got her hands "dirty" in all kinds of work:  photocopying, creating mailing labels, testing out different fonts for our poster, calling different women's groups, and cleaning up graphics with Tipix (or Liquid Paper, as we know it here.) After a short trip  to the US, Claudia will be heading home to  Germany. We wish Claudia well in her law  studies back in Hamburg.  In this issue, we also debuted (or rather  reclaimed) a new feature, which we call,  "Bad Ads" [see page 29.] We plan to keep  this as an ongoing item to expose sexist,  racist and otherwise oppressive advertising, until no more exists. We invited readers to submit ads and your analysis of them.  That's all for now this month inside  Kinesis. Don't forget, we're off until January Have a happy read. (PS: Put the poster  up in a prominent place, please. Thanks.)  ktoS  is  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999 News  Custody, access and the Divorce Act in Canada:  Media mouthpiece for men  by Louise Shaughnessy   The recent spate of editorials, op-ed  pieces, articles and newsclips in the major  mainstream media pushing the "fathers'  rights" point of view on custody and access has strengthened women's resolve to  set the record straight. Women from coast  to coast to coast have mobilized to break  the apparent media block on balanced coverage of this issue, and to let members of  parliament, ministers and senators know  that the Joint House/Senate Committee on  Child Custody and Access is headed in the  wrong direction [see box.]  It's bad enough the Committee's  "cross-Canada" (rather, cross to major cities-only) hearings were like kangaroo  court—"father's rights" groups and individual fathers dominated the witness list  with their personal stories of "parental alienation" and personal loss. Committee  members listened to them with respect and  compassion. On the other hand, women's  groups and individual women were jeered,  mocked and their well-researched presentations were derided. Some women said  they were laughed at when they testified  about wife battering and child abuse.  Knowing a bit of the history of the  Committee puts into perspective its process and anticipated recommendations. The  Committee was set up after some llth-hour  concessions were made to Liberal Senator  Anne Cools by the Liberal government, so  that they could get their child support  guidelines bill passed through the Senate.  Cools, a vocal advocate for "fathers'  rights," made her support of the bill contingent on the Liberals opening up the Divorce Act for review.  To make matters worse, the mainstream media is ensuring that the misinformation perpetrated at the very flawed and  one-sided Committee hearings, is being  passed on as "truths" to be used in shaping the public's perception of custody and  access issues.  Recent articles in the Ottawa Citizen  and pieces on CBC's national news are  cases in point. In the November 21st edition of the Citizen, Chris Cobb reports on a  newspaper article written by Secretary of  State for the Status of Women Hedy Fry  criticizing the Committee. Instead of addressing the issues raised by Fry, Cobb's  article is devoted to allowing space for  Cools and Committee Co-chair Roger  Gallaway to chastise Fry for  "unparliamentary behaviour." They called  for her resignation.  A few days later, the Citizen ran an article on a "public opinion" poll, commissioned by the Citizen and conducted by  Compass Research, which found that the  public supports "fathers' rights." If we accepted the "accuracy" of the poll, then it  would appear most Canadians believe that  fathers are not treated fairly in court when  it comes to custody and access matters. As  the Ottawa Citizen is part of the Conrad  Black chain, the article appeared in a  number of other Southam newspapers, including on the front page of the Vancouver  Sun.  As for CBC's national news, two recent  pieces on the Committee gave a great deal  Women's Justice Network  The Women's Justice Network (wjn) is a national coalition of women's organizations and individual women  which came together online in late October to mobilize responses to the biased process of the joint House/  Senate committee on child Custody and Access.  WJN facilitates its activities through an activist listserve  and website. The impetus for setting WJN up came out  of meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Custody and  Access in Vancouver. The goal is to raise awareness  about issues related to custody and access as they  impact on women and children, and to counter the  backlash against women coming from "fathers' rights"  advocates and their allies.  The first action initiated by WJN was a national fax/  letter campaign during the week of November 16th.  The campaign was intended to discredit the joint Committee's process and nullify any recommendations that  come from the Committee, and to encourage politicians to take a stand against the inappropriate behaviour of Committee members.  check out WJN at http://www.web.net/wjn. The website contains critical information on the coalition and  its campaigns, articles from various newspapers related  to the Committee and the issues, resource and background materials, and links to other related websites.  more air time to images and interviews  with "fathers' rights" advocates than to  advocates working in support of women  and their children.  The Committee hearings and mainstream media coverage are painting a  frightening picture of the state of custody  and access in this country. They would have  us believe that most divorced and separated families are tangled in a web of endless wrangling over the kids, with visions  of distraught fathers weeping on their ex's  doorsteps, and that the Divorce Act is causing chaos throughout the nation!  In fact, most divorcing couples work  out their custody and access issues without going to court. Most, after the first year  or so of sorting out the details, settle into a  workable arrangement. According to Department of Justice statistics, only 3.8 percent of all custody and access cases are resolved through the courts.  There is also little support for "fathers'  rights" advocates' contention that custodial  parents regularly deny access to the noncustodial parent. Overwhelmingly, family  law lawyers say that a much more pervasive problem is the access parent failing to  show up for a visit, leaving the custodial  parent with the task of consoling the child  with assurances that "daddy still cares."  Leaks of interim reports from the Committee reveal some frightening implications  for women and their children. It seems the  favourite principle guiding the Commit  tee's report is a presumption of "shared  parenting." Women and women's groups  have been saying all along that regular contact is desirable where the relationships  between both parents and children are positive. However, women's and children's  safety and well-being cannot be compromised in the name of "fathers' rights."  Contrary to Cools' recent statements,  fathers, not mothers, are responsible for  most of the physical and sexual assaults  against children. In 1996, fathers were  found responsible for 73 percent of all  physical assaults and 98 percent of all  sexual assaults against children. And that's  according to Statistics Canada.  The National Association and the Law  believes that the "best interests of the children" must be paramount and that custody  issues should be governed by a presumption in favour of the primary caregiver. That  is, courts should look to who has done (and  is doing) the caregiving, rather than who is  promising to do caregiving. Additionally,  there should be a presumption that abuse—  whether it is physical, emotional or  sexual—of one parent by the other parent  is not in the "best interests" of the child.  Another core principle that appears to  be governing the Committee's recommendations is that "children's interests upon  family dissolution should be determined  jointly by their parents." This may sound  desirable but, in reality, it would require a  high level of contact which may not be fea  sible or safe. Generally, the decision-making  ability should fall to the parent who assumes the bulk of the caregiving role.  Another of the Committee's bedrock  principles is that "children and parents  need and have a right to swift and decisive  protection from violence and from false  accusations of violence." The inclusion of  "false accusations of violence" gives the  misleading impression that such accusations constitute a serious problem, on the  same scale as the violence itself. The reality is that accusations of sexual abuse of  children are made in just two percent of  contested divorces, and only eight percent  of those are proven to be false.  "Children, grandparents and other extended family members need and have a  right to a continuing relationship with one  another," reads another one of the Committee's principles. While positive relationships with extended family members are  desirable and beneficial, why should  grandparents be given more rights to access their grandchildren after the divorce  than they had before the divorce?  Finally, the principle that points to increased use of mediation is problematic:  "Children have a need to have their future  and their families' future determined in the  least adversarial manner possible." Protracted, acrimonious disputes are things  everyone wants to avoid. However, the requirement for mediation gives rise to a  number of concerns. Mediation is only  likely to work when the parties have equal  bargaining power. This is rare in most cases,  and is particularly rare in family law disputes. Mediation is also never appropriate  where there has been abuse or violence.  Almost one year and more than $1  million later, the Joint Senate/House Committee on Child Custody and Access will  release its report. It's final deadline is December 11, when Parliament recesses for the  holidays.  Once the report is on the table, it will  be up to the Minister of Justice Anne  McLellan and the Department of Justice to  decide whether or not to entertain amendments to the Divorce Act. Certainly, it is  critical that feminists press McLellan with  their own recommendations.  NAWL encourages women to contact  Anne McLellan and express their point of view  about the recommendations from the joint Committee.

She thanks  the many women inside and outside of NAWL  who have worked on the organization's analysis and position on custody and access issues.  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999 News  Women in the arts:  Out of view  by leanne Johnson  This is the issue where Kinesis normally  announces the upcoming Women in View  Festival in Vancouver, billed as Canada's  only multi-disciplinary women's performing arts festival.  Last year, I personally wrote an inspiring piece on Women in View's 10th anniversary. In that article, I mentioned how anniversaries should function as an opportunity for the festival and its audience members to reflect on and review what they have  done and where they are headed.  Some of the questions I asked were:  "Has the Women in View Festival improved  the lot for women in theatre?" According  to their statistics, they had indeed had an  impact. In 1991-1992, only nine percent of  all plays produced in Vancouver were written by women and 20 percent were directed  by them. In 1996-1997, 20 percent of Vancouver plays were written by women and  37 percent directed by them.  I also asked whether the View had  maintained its promise to help promote  emerging women artists. Over the last 10  years, more than 1,500 women playwrights,  poets, performers and dancers have been  showcased by Women in View. Impressive  statistics by far, but certainly not a fait accompli.  So what happened this year? Why am  I taking so long to announce the upcoming  Festival festivities? Well, those of you that  read Conrad Black's local rag would know  that the Women in View Festival is kaput.  Gone. Is it my fault... asking all those hard  questions about direction? Nope, because,  I am a little ashamed to say, the View hasn't  been paying much attention to us in the  feminist media over the past few years,  preferring rather to announce things to people like Black and his ilk.  The demise of the decade old Women  in View festival was the result of several  factors. For one: Financial. Financial. Financial. Those of you unfamiliar with arts funding in this province may well ask, "Did last  year's festival not do well? Was it under-  attended? Did they have a large deficit?"  These are good questions, but you would  be off-track. According to Dawn Brennan,  former executive director of the Women in  View Festival, the View's 10th Anniversary  was an artistic and financial success. They  not only broke even; they even enjoyed a  small surplus.  So why did this apparently successful  festival fail? Location. Location. Location.  You see, Women in View has the misfortune of being located in British Columbia,  whose only arts funding claim to fame is  that we rank last in per capita funding of  the performing and visual arts. (That's according to Statistics Canada's Government  Expenditures on Culture, 1995-1996.) Proving that they could still kill more of the arts  in BC, the provincial government further  cut funding to festival organizations in  1998.  Also this year, the View and several  other arts organizations were put in jeopardy as a result of the restructuring of casino revenues. (The restructuring was long  overdue, but many an arts budget was  stretched to breaking while waiting for cash  to come in.)  the back hills guest house for women  Explore rural Metchosin.

(The View did eventually get  confirmation of funding from du Maurier,  but it was too late. Is this another case of  the tobacco giants outliving their clients?)  The final blow came to the View with  the resignation of two key individuals, Executive Director Dawn Brennan and Artistic Director Kate Weiss. Both women and  the Board of Directors became tired of never  seeing any financial light at the end of the  tunnel. Even after the View changed its direction to become more mainstream, acquired snazzy media sponsors, and sold  their soul to the tobacco industry, there was  never enough money to secure the festival.  Women in View was indeed in a sad  position. They couldn't get corporate sponsorship because they were "ghettoized as  a women's festival." (Although providing  a tasty target audience for the tobacco industry.) Tired of building the festival on the  backs of women, the Board decided in the  Spring of 1998 to announce its demise.  I asked Brennan what she thought the  future held for Vancouver women in theatre with the demise of the Women in View  Festival? She sadly declared that the festival would definitely be a loss for all women.  She thought that women would continue  to increase their presence in theatre, but it  would be in slow increments.  Will the View just pass out of existence  without any further adieu? Or will some  feisty young women try to start another  grassroots festival for women in the performing arts? Well, I promised not to say  but there are some rumours adrift... So I am  just gonna say "Goodbye for now."  leanne Johnson is a Vancouver writer who  thinks you can't keep a good festival down.

Organized by the Pesticide Action Network  (PAN) and Tenaganita, more than 180  women from 22 countries came together to  organize against the trade and investment  liberalization policies of APEC.  The conference opened with a beautiful lamp lighting ceremony to remember  all the women who have lost their lives resisting globalization, as well as the women  who continue the struggle today. The deepening economic crises in Asia lent a political urgency to the Women's Conference.  At the plenary session, Ita Nadia spoke  of the increasing violence against women  in Indonesia, and the lack of attention being paid to women's experiences by the  leaders of the pro-democracy movements.  She pointed out that, although General  Suharto has been deposed as president, the  reality is that the ruling elite's close partnership with the military is still very much  intact.  The assaults and murders of women  are widespread. Nadia said that hundreds  of women were raped and killed in the May  riots in Jakarta, and mass rape is being used  in an organized manner to repress communities [see Kinesis September 1998.] The systematic raping of women—the majority of  whom are of Chinese origin—reveals that  the attacks were part of a coordinated strategy, and not "spontaneous," as has been  presented in the media.  Nadia pointed to further evidence that  speaks to the organized nature of this violence: identity cards of many of the women  raped were taken from them, making it  more difficult for them to report the crimes.  And while the state is targeting and harassing women activists who are working  with these women, the pro-democracy  movements are not seriously addressing  women's issues, or the horrendous violence  against women.  Tati Krishnawathy of Solidaritas  Perempuan, a women's solidarity group in  Indonesia, said that the economic crises  have resulted in a dramatic increase in unemployment throughout  the region. In Indonesia  alone, 15 million workers have lost their paid  jobs, and a large number  of them are women.  Even when men become  unemployed, women  are still the ones left  holding families and  communities together.  Governments in the  region are responding to  the increased unemployment with mass  deportations of migrant  workers, Krishnawathy  said. The Malaysian  government, for example, is forcefully deporting migrant workers from Indonesia  and Bangladesh.  Song Thon, an activist from Thailand,  talked about the resistance organized by  women against the Thai government's  project to build the world's biggest dam.  The dam would displace many communities. Women from several villages have  been at the forefront of mobilizing their  communities' resistance. The women's actions have raised awareness about the  project, as well as garnered public support.  A number of other groups subsequently  came together to form the Forum of the  Poor.  Peasant women were the first in the  Philippines to campaign against Structural  Adjustment Programs (SAPs) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), Tita from GABRIELA, a national  coalition of women's groups in the Philippines, pointed out. The women's movement has become increasingly militant, and  strongly rejects the current strategy adopted  by the Philippine government of trying to  "mainstream" women into "sharing" the  supposed benefits of globalization.  GABRIELA says globalization is just a furthering of American imperialism in the region; it is only working to expand and protect the rights of US corporations.  Speaker after speaker reiterated the  strength of women's movements and discussed the tremendous obstacles to women's liberation which are becoming more  deeply entrenched through trade liberalization policies. Vandana Shiva from India  defined globalization as "the ultimate expression of patriarchal power." She argued  that while globalization is giving corporations incredible rights and powers, it is simultaneously destroying the lives and livelihoods of women.  The diversity by which women live  and their creative labour are what give rise  to possibilities for resistance. Freedom in  the future, Shiva said, remains rooted in this  diversity and creativity.  In addition to the plenary sessions,  there were workshops on health, privatization and reproductive rights; land, food  security and sustainable agriculture; labour  and migration; trafficking and violence  against women; indigenous women;  United Nations instruments; and strategies,  gains and challenges for women at the conference.  Briefly, the recommendations from  these workshops reflected two different  strategies among activists: those who argue  for reform of existing global structures and  the formation of new international regulatory bodies, and those who argue for a radical transformation of existing economic and  political structures through women's—and  peoples'—movements.  After some discussion, the Women's  Conference adopted a statement which resoundingly rejected the World Trade Organization (WTO) and any moves to legitimize it through social or environmental  clauses. The Conference also agreed to  prioritize a campaign for the immediate  removal of agriculture from the GATT/  WTO.  Following the Women's Conference  was the Asia Pacific People's Assembly  (APPA). Although peoples' assemblies had  been organized in Vancouver in 1997 and  in Manila in 1996, the APPA was different  from previous years in a very significant  way.  In the past, the peoples' assemblies  have been non-partisan—not endorsing  any political party or politician—no matter what the political affiliations of the various participants and their organizations  might have been. This non-partisan position changed at the APPA in Kuala Lumpur,  as organizers endorsed and strongly supported Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's  ex-deputy prime minister. [Pro-democracy  activists and many women's groups in Malaysia have been rallying behind Anwar after he  was dumped from government and arrested on  charges of sodomy by Prime Minister Mahatir.]  What the consequences of this partisanship will be for future anti-APEC organizing remains to be seen.  The 1999 APEC Leaders' Summit is  scheduled to take place in Aotearoa/New  Zealand, and the APPA ended with a presentation by delegates from Aotearoa/New  Zealand on their plans. Their focus will be  on opposing APEC throughout the year by  targeting all APEC ministerial meetings and  forums, not just the Leaders' Summit, as  has been the case until now. Public education campaigns will be used to raise awareness about APEC and the policies being  developed and "voluntarily" implemented.  The anti-APEC groups in Aotearoa/  New Zealand will hold a two-day conference at the same time as the Leader's Summit, but the aim will be to bring together a  small number of activists to focus specifically on developing new strategies. The  New Zealand government has adopted a  "constructive engagement" approach towards working with non-governmental organizations in an attempt to look as if it is  consulting with them. The plans presented  for the Aotearoa/New Zealand assembly  will certainly foil the government's agenda  to co-opt NGOs.  A demonstration organized by APPA  ended the anti-APEC activities in Kuala  Lumpur.  While the economic crises are clearly  devastating communities, and in particular women, those attending the Leaders'  Summit paid very little attention to this  reality. Instead of the crises forcing the  heads of state to re-examine and reject the  trade and investment liberalization policies  which have led to the current economic  chaos, they seem even more determined to  push ahead with their "free trade" policies.  Indeed, they are now consciously seeking  to integrate women into the APEC process  even more fully, as was outlined at the  APEC ministerial meeting on women in  Manila last September.  It is clear that women's movements  around the world need to become more  radical and challenge the notion that a fundamental transformation of the global  economy is not possible. Today, it is the  grassroots organizing of women that is rejecting the replacement of one form of tyranny with another, and that is building alternate visions to APEC and globalization.

The gathering  was the second phase in AWAN's research  project investigating and analyzing the  impact of Bill C-31 on the lives of Aboriginal women and their children [see Kinesis  October 1998.]  Bill C-31, introduced in 1985, replaced  Section 12(l)(b) of the Indian Act, which  caused Aboriginal women to lose their "Indian status" when they married non-Aboriginal men. Aboriginal men did not lose  status when they married non-Aboriginal  women.  Although the bill was designed to  clean the Indian Act of its gender-based  discriminatory elements and thereby improve the situation of Aboriginal women,  it has become apparent that, in fact, little  has changed. Or as one speaker at the gathering put it: "sexist discrimination has simply been knocked down to the next generation."  Many women who regained status  were reinstated into categories that do not  allow them to pass their status on to their  children or to their children's children. As  well, many women have not gone through  the complex process to become reinstated,  because there has been little support provided to them by either the federal government or local band councils.  AWAN hopes to change that situation.  Its research project, set for completion in  late Spring, consists of four phases: generating a literature review that brings together  and analyzes the findings of academic,  community and government studies; interviewing women affected by Bill C-31 across  the province; compiling their stories; and  producing a final report to be used in lobbying for changes to the legislation as well  as for educational purposes.  In preparation for Phase 2, about 40  delegates from different Nations all over the  province came together for the weekend  workshop on participatory research. Sixteen of the women in attendance had  agreed to conduct the interviews in their  home communities. They received background information on Bill C-31 and training through a popular education workshop  on interviewing. Over the course of the  weekend, a set of questions to be used in  gathering stories from other women across  the province was generated.  The participants spent a considerable  part of the weekend talking about their  own, often painful, experiences resulting  from loss of status, and about the difficulties they've faced in trying to go through  the reinstatement process and return to  their homes.  Little or no advocacy is out there to  help women with this process, and in many  cases, band councils who are not supportive of women being reinstated have tried  to deter women from returning home or  have forced them to leave. Many band  councils feel threatened by the presence of  strong vocal women returning from urban  areas, and many do not want to share the  resources and programs with them. [Under Bill C-31, band councils have the authority to determine who has "membership" in the  band, and therefore access to education, health,  housing and income support programs are administered by the band.]  The treaty-making process in BC has  also reinforced discrimination against  women because women who do not have  "status" cannot vote on treaty agreements  affecting their home communities. Their  participation is obviously not seen as necessary or important, as no government—  federal, provincial or band—has seen to it  that their voices are included in the process.  Other common themes discussed on  the weekend were the loss of culture and  issues of identity. "Aside from the Indian  Act [definition,] who is 'Indian'?" was a  question which arose. "How restrictive  should band membership codes be?" was  another.  While opinions differed on blood  quantum as a system of measuring identity, a sense of separation from and division of community was shared by many.  How bands are served by discriminating  against women was also a point of discussion.  Theme related questions were formulated which examined the effects of Bill C-  31 on individuals, families and communities. They also addressed the reinstatement  process as well as access to rights under the  bill.  Sharon Mclvor, a member of the Lower  Nicola Band in Merritt, BC, spoke on the  first full day of gathering. As a lawyer and  a woman owned and operated business specializing in defensive driver training  Pitting; Softool  Driver Improvement and Retraining  - Become a confident and safe driver with an experienced instructor -  activist, she has long been fighting for the  rights of Aboriginal women. Drawing from  her experience, she underlined to participants the importance of extensive and complete documentation, so essential in court  challenges. She said a number of the  women she is representing will likely take  their cases to the Supreme Court of Canada,  where the project's final report may make  a difference.  The weekend was a success, not only  because the process of participatory research on Bill C-31 is underway, but also  because Aboriginal women who are isolated in their communities, and in some  cases geographically, had the opportunity  to share their experiences and begin organ  izing against patriarchal discrimination by  both the state and Aboriginal men.  AWAN is still looking for Aboriginal  women from the following regions to conduct  interviews in their communities: Kamloops,  Northern Vancouver Island, the Kootenays,  and Northeastern BC. Volunteers will also be  needed to help with transcribing the interviews. To participate or for more information,  contact AWAN at (604) 879-8094,435-5449,  255-0704.

Recently, Gomez was notified that  her appeal of the deportation order was  denied.  The Filipino community in British  Columbia is rallying behind her attempt  to gain a Minister's Permit (from the Minister of Immigration Lucienne Robillard.)  This permit is now the only hope Gomez  has of being able to stay in Canada with  her four-year old daughter, Amber.  Acier Gomez was ordered deported  from Canada June 10,1997, even though  she had lived, worked and contributed to  Canadian society for the last eight years.  She came to Canada under the Live-in  Caregiver Program in 1990, and lived in  Prince George, BC.  She was ordered to return to the Philippines because she had "misrepresented"  her marital status. She listed herself as single on her entry application as a domestic  worker and on her application for landed  immigrant status. She was, in fact, married in the Philippines.  The Committee for Justice for Acier  Gomez says many domestic workers make  the same mistake Gomez did because they  are advised by recruitment agencies that  it will be easier for them to find work if  they are single. Gomez did not correct the  mistake when she applied for landed status because her employer, who later became her husband, advised her not to. After Gomez left her husband because of his  violence towards her, he told Canada Immigration about the "misrepresentation."  The Committee recently held a press  conference and community forum with  Gomez in Vancouver to draw attention to  her urgent plight and to help others who  might be in similar situations. It is calling  on all supporters to write to the minister of  immigration to ask her to grant Acier  Gomez a Minister's Permit and set aside  the deportation order.

Hurricane Mitch  emergency relief  Women's groups in Central America  have sent out an urgent call for international help and solidarity in the wake of  Hurricane Mitch. In October, the hurricane  ripped through Nicaragua, Honduras and  El Salvador, leaving a high death and injury toll as well as badly damaged infrastructures.  Sandra Ramos of the Maria Elena  Cuadra Movement of Working and Unemployed Women (MEC) in Nicaragua says  that "so many women lost their families,  their homes and their belongings." MEC  organized a caravan to take food to the  norther town of Posoltega, where a giant  mudslide killed at least 2,000 people and  left tens of thousands homeless. Josefa  Rivera, also with MEC, says transportation  is almost impossible: some 1,500 kilometres of roads and 70 bridges have been destroyed or not safe to cross.  In Honduras, the death toll is over  7,000 with at least another 5,000 people reported missing. Members of the Honduran  Women's Collective (CODEMUH) say that  no part of the country has been spared.  Ninety percent of the country has been  flooded and 60 percent of the infrastructure destroyed. The price of food and basic  goods continues to rise due to speculation,  and both water and air-borne diseases have  begun to affect the population.  According to Sandra Ramos and Maria  Luisa Regalado, the director of  CODEMUH, the maquila factories in both  Nicaragua and Honduras have taken a  "business as usual" attitude, despite the  surrounding tragedy and chaos. Some factory owners are refusing to pay compensation for the days the factories were closed  and are requiring women to work overtime  to make up for lost hours.  Financial donations are badly needed, and  can be sent to Co-Development Canada, 101-  2747 E. Hastings St, Vancouver, BC, V5K1Z8.  Cheques should be made payable to Co-Development Canada, which will forward donations  to its partner organizations in Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador, such as MEC and  CODEMUH.

Can a child sue for  prenatal injuries?  by Kate Murphy   Another legal case that could affect  Canadian women's reproductive rights is  headed for the Supreme Court of Canada.  Known as the Dobson case, it involves a  New Brunswick woman who got into a car  accident during the 27th week of her pregnancy. Cynthia Dobson sustained injuries  and underwent a caesarean section that day.  Her son was born with permanent disabilities, including cerebral palsy.  In an attempt to receive insurance  funds for his care, Ryan Dobson, represented by his grandfather as his litigation  guardian, sued his mother for prenatal in  juries suffered as a result of the accident.  The suit claims that Cynthia Dobson was  negligent for failing to avoid the acccident.  Both the New Brunswick Queen's  Bench and the New Brunswick Court of  Appeal held that a child born alive could  sue his/her mother for damages done before birth. The case will go before the Supreme Court of Canada on December 8th.  The Supreme Court has previously  ruled on the issue of fetal rights, and has  upheld that a fetus is not a "person" and  therefore not entitled to rights. Its most recent decision involved a Winnipeg woman  who was ordered into a drug treatment program for the remainder of her pregnancy  The Canadian Abortion Rights Action  League (CARAL) will intervene in the  Dobson case, as will two anti-choice  groups. CARAL will argue that allowing a  child to successfully sue his/her mother for  prenatal injuries is the wrong solution to  the problem.  While recognizing the cost involved in  providing adequate care for children with  disabilities and the lack of assistance in  ensuring such care, the solution being put  forward does not address that situation.  CARAL says that, as a society, we need to  find other ways to make funding available  for all children with special needs.  The danger of this case is that it could  open up the floodgates to all kinds of claims  against pregnant women. If the Supreme  Court rules in favour of Ryan Dobson,  women's reproductive rights, such as the  right to obtain an abortion or refuse a  caesarean section, will be curtailed. And  although this case relates to motor vehicle  accidents, the principle could be applied to  other daily activities women engage in,  such as working, operating equipment,  engaging in sports or recreation activities,  et cetera.  ■s**   Boo hoo milk: Profils over health    ~  by Kelly Haydon  The Canadian government is considering the legalization of Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH), a genetically-engineered drug  that is injected into cows to increase their  milk production, even though it may pose  serious health threats to humans, not to  mention cows.  Government scientists at Health Canada  have written a report contirming that the  chemical company Monsanto, which produces  BGH, did not subject BGH to long-term toxicology experiments and tests for human  safety. They also say that potential harmful  effects from BGH—such as sterility, infertility, birth defects, cancer, and harm to the  immune system—haven't been fully checked  out.  Some cows given BGH gave birth to  calves with holes in their skulls and, in one  case, a calf with seven legs. As well, scientific studies show a by-product in BGH milk  may be linked to incidences of breast cancer  or prostate cancer. According to Senator Mira  Spivak, a member of the Senate Committee  on Agriculture which is holding hearings on  the health effects of BGH: "It is not going  to improve the quality of the milk, and it  makes the cows sick. What problem are we  solving with [allowing BGH on the market]?  Well, we are going to increase the profits of  the company."  In November, the Senate Committee  heard testimony from six researchers who  say they have been ordered by Health Canada  not to speak publicly about the dangers of  BGH. Dr. Margaret Haydon testified how her  files on BGH were stolen from her office in  1994, and Dr. Gerard Lambert said his file  was kept locked up at the Health Protection  Branch (HPB) and made available to only a  few people.  Haydon also suggested that Monsanto  may have attempted to bribe the department in 1990 with at least Si million in research funding to approve BGH. The company  denies the accusation. Proving that Monsanto  tried to bribe the HPB may be difficult, as  Health Canada's approval process for drugs  is seriously flawed with respect to conflict  of interest. Ninety percent of the budget  for the HPB comes from the drug companies.  According to the Council of Canadians  (COO, a national organization fighting the  use of BGH, much of the problem stems with  senior government bureaucrats who are trying to assist Monsanto in getting BGH legalized by pressuring scientists to approve the  drug. At the Senate hearing, Haydon said she  and the other five scientists were pressed  by their superiors to approve drugs, including BGH, even though they had concerns  about their safety. She added that several  bureaucrats refused to release the scientists'  critical report until they deleted controversial parts of it.  Although two "external" reviews on BGH  have been ordered, the organizations conducting these reviews can hardly be called  objective. One review will be done by the  Canadian Veterinary Medical Association,  which is officially on record as supporting  BGH. The second review will be done by the  Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons,  even though one of the panel members had  been a paid consultant for Monsanto and  another member has a very close association with the company.  Allegations of corruption at the HPB are  not news to women who remember the Meme  breast implant fiasco. In the late 1980s,  Linda Wilson brought information to Health  and Welfare Canada about severe negative  health effects of the Meme implant. What  ensued was similar to the BGH circus going  on now. In the case of Meme, business interests took precedence over health. Researchers involved were silenced by gag orders and  suspension; reports were difficult to obtain,  and tissue samples "lost."  Monsanto has been a social pariah for  awhile. In the 1950s and 1960s, Rachel  Carson (environmentalist and author of Silent Spring,) warned the public of the deadly  health effects of the cancer-causing pesticides DDT and organochlorines. Monsanto  joined other chemical companies and governmental officials in denying the dangers  of the pesticides, and attacking Carson's  credibilty.  Monsanto continues its deadly games in  the 90's with the production of pesticides,  as well as new ventures in genetically altered food plants (such as soy beans). These  plants are being mutated to withstand three  times the usual spraying of Monsanto's pesticide, Roundup. So the company is profiting from being able to sell three times the  amount of pesticide than usual, and the public is getting to ingest three times as much  of the deadly chemicals.  Meanwhile, Monsanto has been heavily  lobbying the government, not only to allow  BGH to be brought to the Canadian market,  but also to ensure there would be no indication on packaging that products contain BGH-  affected milk. That would mean Canadians  would have no way of knowing whether they  were consuming tainted milk or not.  Now BGH is being re-evaluated, and according to Allan Rock, federal minister of  health, "we will not give approval [of BGH]  until the safety of that substance is determined to our satisfaction." This is contrary  to what most Canadians want, which is a  permanent ban on BGH.  If you don'I wan! BGH approved, fend a  teller lo Senator Leonard Guslafson, Chairperson, Senate Committee on Agriculture,  the Senate of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, KIA  0A4.

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999  ktaSis Feature  Treaty-making in British Columbia:  Nisga'a process flawed  by Nisibilada (MercyThomas)   As Kinesis goes to press, the Nisga'a  Agreement is before a special Fall session of  the British Columbia legislature. Judging from  the media coverage, it would appear there are  only two perspectives on the issue: the pro-  agreement stance of the Nisga'a Tribal Council and the New Democrat government, and  the anti-agreement stance of the provincial Liberal Party and other right-wing interests.  However, there is another perspective coming from Aboriginal peoples, particularly those  living off-reserve. In an attempt to get their  voices heard, the United Native Nations  (UNN), held its second Trick or Treaty rallyin  Vancouver on October 31st.  The current treaty-making process in BC,  says UNN's president Viola Thomas, is "not  about self-determination, but self-termination."  The UNN, an organization which represents  off-reserve Aboriginal peoples in BC, says the  it is aimed at effectively extinguishing all Aboriginal title, by converting Aboriginal titled  lands to "fee simple" lands [Fee simple means  lands and the resources on them can be bought,  sold or leased, essentially making them market  commodities.]  Almost half of the First Nations bands in  BC—84 of 197 communities—have refused to  participate in the BC Treaty Commission process. If passed, the Nisga'a Agreement will be  the template for all treaties in BC. The Agreement would give the Nisga'a about 2,000  square kilometres of land, cash and new powers of self government. The treaty is "valued"  at $490 million. In return though, the Nisga'a  would release government from future claims,  relinquish their Aboriginal title to other territories, and give up their tax-free status.  One of the speakers at this year's Trick or  Treaty rally was Nisibilada (Mercy Thomas),  a Nisga'a matriarch from the House of  Nee'is'lis'eyan in Kincolith. She is a mother, a  grandmother and a great-grandmother.  Nisibilada has been active in the land claims  struggle of the Nisga'a people for several decades. More recently, she has been working in  the social service area. She currently lives off-  reserve in Surrey, BC. Below, she talks about  why she opposes the Nisga'a Agreement.  I am here today to say that not all of us  from the Nass River are in agreement with  this treaty because the process in which it  was negotiated is flawed.  When my father was a young man, he  was one of the surveyors who went up the  Nass River. They went to Canyon City, to  Aiyansh, then to Greenville. They were sent  away. [The people in those communities]  said they did not want their lands surveyed.  Because of this, my father said, "We are  going to survey only Kincolith lands." As  a result, Kincolith people have certificates  of possession to the land. The people of the  Upper Nass don't have any.  Because none of the other lands had  been surveyed, when the Nisga'a Tribal  Council (NTC) came to negotiating this  land claims agreement with the provincial  government, the 42 Kincolith reserves were  the only lands included.  The NTC used the Kincolith lands as  their bargaining chip in order to gain control over fisheries and forestry. They nego-  Nisibilada (MercyThomas), centre front, speaking at the United Native  Nations'Trick orTreaty rally in Vancouver. She sang the song ,"Ei'yu'wai,"  which she translates as:  What nave tney done to my people; what nave tney done to my community or.  Kincolith. Ei'yu'wai  We are going to lose the ancestral lands or our great-grandfathers and  grandmothers  We are going to lose tne traplines and tne hunting grounds or our uncles  We are going to lose the stories or our mothers and grandmothers that belong  to the land. Ei'yu'wai  Non-Indians in government waved a tew dollars in front of our people and  they sold our land  What will happen to our children; they will scatter; they'll have no place to go  Our grandchildren will he no more. Ei'yu'wai  What have they done to my people; what have they done to my village of  Kincolith  We have lost everything. Ei'yu'wai  tiated to take away 19 reserves from  Kincolith and to increase the Aiyansh reserves by 19. [The president of the Nisga'a  Treaty Council, Chief Joe Gosnell, is from  Aiyansh.] They negotiated to increase  Greenville reserves by two and Canyon  City reserves by two, taking the four reserves from Kincolith lands. The remaining 19 Kincolith reserves are to be converted  into "fee simple" land that can be sold or  leased if the Nisga'a government has financial problems.  The NTC told Kincolith people that  we'd keep our lands, but five years from  now [when the provisions in the Nisga'a  Agreement have all taken effect,] 93 percent of Kincolith lands will have been lost.  We are only receiving seven percent of our  great-great-grandfathers' and our great-  great-grandmothers' lands. The only reserve Kincolith people are going to get to  keep is the one we are living on now.  The majority of us did not know what  was in the Nisga'a Agreement-In-Principle  (ATP). Everything was negotiated in secret.  The 32 people who negotiated this deal did  not take the AIP back to the people on the  Nass River before it was initialed. They told  us after the fact.  A lot of Nisga'a people still have not  read the ALP. Most people don't understand  what they are losing by supporting the ALP.  We did not know about the section on the  release of our Aboriginal Title until [BC Lib  eral Party leader Gordon] Campbell leaked  it to the media.  After the ALP was initialed on February 14,1996, the NTC called a special assembly in Aiyansh. That was on February  22, when the weather is at its worst on the  Nass River, so there were only 1,500 [out  of 6,000] Nisga'as there for the four day  meeting. Copies of the AIP were only  handed out to the Nisga'a people as we  entered the door to the assembly.  On February 24,1 asked the NTC if  there was going to be a vote on the AIP.  They said, "No, this is an information meeting only, an update." They also said they  were going to go around to the villages and  do workshops with the people on the AIP.  By the last day of the assembly, most  people, including myself, had to return  home. There were only 500 people left, and  the majority of them were from Aiyansh.  Someone made a motion to have another  meeting to accept the AIR However, the  NTC interpreted this as support for their  negotiation process. The Nisga'a Tribal  Council then held a stand-up vote for acceptance of the AIP, [which they received.]  I don't believe that any government  should be a government unto itself; they  must have an opposition party to keep  them honest. If they don't, then they're a  dictatorship. We are a matrilineal society  and there was not one woman, not one  matriarch, sitting at the negotiating table.  When I speak out [against the Nisga'a  Agreement,] my people in Kincolith are  chastised, and I feel bad about that. I apologize to them because I do feel it right here  fc in my heart. But I was not the one who ne-  |c£ gotiated the release, the extinguishment, the  | modification of Aboriginal title, and the  ^ majority of our people did not agree to that.  ^ The Nisga'a Tribal Council is registered  ~- as a society under the provincial societies  g> act. They have no right to relinquish, ex-  ^ tinguish, surrender, modify or release any  ^ of our Aboriginal land. We did not give the  | NTC the mandate to sign the Nisga'a  £! Agreement on behalf of Kincolith people.  •« We did not give the NTC the mandate to  o release our Aboriginal title, our Aboriginal  a. rights, and to give up the tax exemption  status of our people. They don't know what  it is like to be taxed. I do; I live in the urban  area. Nothing in the Nisga'a Treaty was  negotiated for people living off-reserve.  I have been one of the staunchest supporters of self-government and self-determination, and of getting away from the  Department of Indian Affairs, but I don't  like the process in which this treaty was  reached. The Nisga'a Tribal Council did not  leave room for my great-grandchildren to  come back and correct their mistakes.  And while the negotiators and their  families are getting richer, the rest of the  Nisga'a are still as poor as they were before this deal was initialed. The negotiators  are paid $525 a day plus expenses. The NTC  promised to pay the Elders $15,000 a piece  if this deal goes through. Fifteen thousand  dollars is what the negotiators make in a  month. How dare they try and pay off the  Elders.  The land will be here forever; the  money will be gone in no time. At the rate  the NTC is spending it now, there won't be  anything left for my great-grandchildren.  When we were negotiating land claims in  1969 and 1971, we paid for it out of our own  pockets; we worked for it. Since the NTC  started negotiating with the government 15  years ago, they've racked up a debt of more  than $50 million. They borrowed that  money from the government, and we will  have to pay it back.  At this time, I have a song to sing. Right  after the ALP was initialed, this song came  to me. Whenever we asked questions about  the treaty process, our leaders told us, "I'm  sorry, this is confidential, we cannot discuss  it with you." They couldn't discuss the  treaty with us, the ones they were negotiating on behalf of. That is unacceptable.  I do not want to see my ancestral lands  given away or used as bargaining chips.  Ninety-three percent of our lands will be  lost. My uncles' traplines will be no more.  And that's what this song is about. It's  called "Ei'yu'wai." "Ei'yu'wai" is a distress  signal. Nisga'as use it only when there is a  death or sudden accident, or when something is wrong or troubling.  I sing this song in the hopes my people will remember my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren when their  lands are chipped away before their eyes.  SIS  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999 Through the lens of Kinesis:  25 years of the women's movement in Canada  Our goal in producing this special supplement was to look at the women's movement in  Canada over the past 25 years through the lens  of Kinesis. Twenty-five years equals 250 plus  issues of Kinesis. (Fortunately, we still have at  least one copy of almost all the back issues in  our archives.) As we read and read and read, we  were stunned and amazed by many of the stories; amused by the cartoons and drawings; and  inspired by the passion that came pouring out  of the pages.  In one of our searches through old Kinesi  (that's the plural, not a typo,) we discovered an  exciting gem, which you will find on page 28. It  seems that in Kinesis exactly 10 years ago, the  women involved published a full page "ad" condemning global patriarchy. They wrote the piece  in response to homophobic "claptrap" run in  Vancouver dailies a few weeks earlier. Most of  what was said by feminists then can certainly  still be said by feminists today. In fact, it would  have been great to have used this ad a few months  ago, when the Globe and Mail accepted  $43,000 to print a full-page rant against lesbians and gays. [This was published shortly after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled positively in favour of a gay man from Alberta with  respect to equality rights.] Some things  change...  As we put together this supplement, we had  the uneasy need to make some choices of what  to include and what not to include. We first decided to limit our selections to the women's  movement in Canada, even though, in recent  years particularly, Kinesis has been covering the  activities of women's groups around the globe.  We also focused on events led by women and  decisions that affected the lives of women and  girls, and less so on the discussions and analyses that were happening along the way.  This is just a sampling. We recognize there  are gaps in our coverage here. Some stem from  our decisions in producing this supplement;  some stem from what made it into the pages of  past Kinesi. We invite readers to share you stories, memories, and analyses with other readers through Kinesis. If appropriate, we will publish your comments in our new feature column,  "Readers' Writes," which will debut in our February 1999 issue.  In upcoming editions of "Inside Kinesis* we  will look at some of what's gone on in the making of this newspaper—the development of policies, the changes in our statement of principles,  the decisions we made to ensure a diversity of  women's voices are reflected. We feel it is important to document our herstory so that other  women, interested in feminist publications, can  draw from our experiences.  Over the course of 1999, Kinesis will continue to include articles that reflect the "movement" of the women's movement in Canada and  around the world. There is much to talk about,  to share, to remember, and to take off from. We  look forward to this process, and we invite you  to join us on this journey.  Thanks and more thanks!  This project would not have been possible without the incredible talent and dedication of the hundreds of women who created Kinesis  month after month over the past 25 years. Although we cannot thank all of them here, we do recognize their contributions in building  Kinesis and the women's movement in Canada. What you hold in your hand is a culmination of their writing, illustrating, researching,  photographing, proofreading, designing and pasting up. We're sure they had fun along the way, too.  Many women, now involved with Kinesis, were critical in digging through boxes and boxes of Kinesis archives and making this special  supplement a reality. We would like to thank: Bernadette Phan, Joanna Frayne, Claudia Deutschland, Corrin Browne, Audrey Huntley,  Amal Rana, Kelly Haydon, Laura Quilici, Leanne Keltie, Janet Mou, Ellen Woodsworth and Agnes Huang. Thanks to Joanna for her  illustrations featured at the top of this page and leading off each decade.  Kinesis also wishes to acknowledge the funding support we received from Status of Women Canada-BC Region to assist in the  production of this special supplement and in the distribution of this issue to women's groups across Canada.  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Dear Santa,  We have worked very hard all year and there are many things that we haven't got that we  feel we deserve to have. Some of our requests may have a familiar ring. This is probably  because we asked for them last year too. But we are filled with the spirit of optimism.  So dear Santa, please:  Give us a new Maternity Protection Act  Find us a word for the plural of Ms.  include housewives in the Canada Pension Plan  Arrange for a heart and brain transplant for (Justice Minister) Otto Lang  Give our children more non-sexist text books  Give us control of our bodies-take abortion out of the Criminal Code  Arrange for a total transplant for Otto Lang  How About a Federal Human Rights Act?  And an amended Federal Labour Code?  Supply a feminist consciousness for Dave Barrett  Set up women's Studies courses in high schools  More Shop Courses for girls  More Home Economics Courses for boys  Compulsory courses for teachers in sex role socialization  Give us more day care facilities (we asked for this last year but you didn't send enough to  go around)  Eliminate sexism in advertising  Develop a male contraceptive pill—share the guinea pig role  Eliminate the courts "double standard" re: rape  Hasten the implementation of all recommendations of the Royal Commission Report on  the status of women.  we remain hopefully,  iwTeRwaTioNak catiPafeN:  In July, 80 women representing Wages for Housework  groups from Toronto, Montreal, the US, Europe, England,  Australia and Mexico gathered in London, England to discuss why women want wages for housework and how to  build an international campaign to win them. A similar conference is going to take place in Toronto this October with  more than 100 women expected to attend.  More and more women are seeing the impact of the struggles women have engaged in for affordable and accessible  daycare, equal pay, and against sexist advertising and children's books. While changing some of the conditions of  women's work, these struggles have not changed the work  itself. Most women working outside the home have been  channelled into "women's jobs"-jobs which are usually  housework in a socialized setting. And still, women bear  the responsibility of child rearing and housework in the  home.  In May, rallies kicking off the Wages for Housework campaign were held in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York, England, Germany and Italy. (September 1975)  Oomfim Z^otwmlwa  (December, 1974)  1975 is International  Women's Year  "If we let her play,  she '11 win all our  marbles. So, let's just  tell her she can 'tplay  because she's a girl. "  Feminists rallied at the Vancouver Courthouse on Mother's Day, May 11, to protest government inaction on women's rights legislation for International Women's Year.  Approximately 150 women, children and men challenged  the government to prove its concern about the oppression  of women by passing laws recommended by the 1970 Royal  Commission on the Status of Women.  One of the participants said that writing letters to MPs  was an activity of "diminishing returns" for women, and  called for collective action to be taken during the rest of  IWY to secure their rights. She suggested using political  lobbying, lawsuits, corporate voting, strikes and civil disobedience, if necessary. (June 1975)  'omen,:  a  On May 25,1974, 300 women came together at Capilano College in North Vancouver for the "Action for  Women Strategy Conference." What clearly emerged  from the gathering was the need to form some sort  of provincial federation to make clear to the government the strength ofthe women's movement  And from there was born the BC Federation  of Women.  Actually, the concept of a coalition of  women's groups had first germinated in August 1973 at a conference at UBC on women and  education. Throughout the  early part of 1974, a spate  of well-attended women's  "/ know all about sex, but I don't want any  part of it... It leads to housework. "  conferences confirmed  the desire to have a unified voice for women in  the province.  Among the groups participating in the founding conference were:  the Women's Health  Collective, Vancouver  Status of Women, the  NDP Women's Rights  Committee, Women in  Teaching, Committee to  Defend Dr. Morgentaler,  the NDP Women's Committee, and the BC Teachers Federation.  The aim of the BCFW is to  demonstrate that through the  power of united numbers,  women can achieve more than as  individuals or individual groups. The  umbrella organization also seeks to coordinate the diversity of organizations into  a mosaic wherein BCFW can represent the needs  of women from every walk of life and from every  part of the world.  This gigantic but challenging task has been entrusted  to the Standing Committee, which is the elected body  of BCFW. (April 1975)  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 What did you learn in  school today, dear?  national lesbian Convention  More than 300 lesbians came from all over Canada to participate in a  National Lesbian    Convention  held at tne University or Ottawa. There were two full days ot workshops and plenary sessions on issues  suck as:   dyke  culture,  lesbians  and small communities,  therapy,  media,  lesbian  mothers,  lesbianism/  feminism, lesbian autonomy/pride,  and wages for housework.  Large tables were set up at the conference site,  where women sold books, t-shirst,  buttons and jewelry.  There was also an assortment or information on most lesbian issues.  One resolution passed unanimously at the conference was that a National Affiliation  of  Lesbians  and  Lesbian  Organizations  be  formed  in order to  communicate  and  formulate lesbian issues and concerns.  (December  1976)  June 1 st is Census Day in Canada and for the first time, married  women, whether employed outside the home or not, may declare  themselves "head of the household" on the form. The change  comes from complaints following the 1971 census, when home-  makers who believed themselves  in charge of the  house had to play  second fiddle (on  paper) to their  husbands. On this year's  form, husbands and wives  can flip for who calls themselves the boss.  (June 1976)  Twenty years later (1996) women's  unpaid work was counted in the  census.  Women's studies  in high schools  March 24th will go down in herstory as  the day the first battle for women's  studies in Vancouver secondary schools  was won. On that day, the Vancouver  School Board approved the course; only  one trustee voted against the proposal.  In Burnaby, the women's centre recently  won a similar victory too. They successfully persuaded the Burnaby School  Board to approve a women's studies  course to be taught at Burnaby North  Senior Secondary. In its approval, the  board also asked how the unit might be  developed to suit Burnaby North's  "multi-cultural character. In addition it  asked that "encouragement be given  to boys to enter the program in  order to better understand  the role of women in society and hence gain a better understanding of their  own role."

(October 1983)  Muckamuck: fi strike for Indian self determination  Employees of the white-owned, Native-staffed Muckamuck Restaurant,  located at 1724 Davie Street in Vancouver, began their strike on June 1,  1978. They went on strike because the restaurant's owners, Jane  Erickson and Doug Chrismas, refused to negotiate fairly with the employees after they were certified with SORWUC (Services, Office and  Retail Workers Union of Canada) in March that year. Instead, the owners harassed and fired employees who were union members.  Among the complaints that led staff to approach SORWUC were: no  job security, no scheduling rights, unpaid staff meetings on days off,  minimum wage, and no grievance procedures.  While on strike, the picketers were  constantly harassed and intimidated by strikebreaking employees  and anti-union people. Several  picketers have been arrested and  some banned from the strike area.  Their strike action has received the  support of various Native groups,  including the Union of BC Indian  Chiefs, United Native Nations and  the Vancouver Indian Centre. Vari-  . ous unions also gave their support.  (August 1980)  After five years, the owners still refused to negotiate with the striking  workers. Instead, they shut down  the Muckamuck Restaurant.  Left: Ethel Gardner started the union drive and was fired the day  Muckamuck received notification of certification to SORWUC. Right: Vikki  Peters was squeezed out of her job after two years of service as a bartender  when the Muckamuck was certified. The owners gave hours to so-called  'professionals' (non-Indian).  Government imposes  limits on childcare  Thousands of students and immigrant families in BC are ineligible for  daycare subsidies. That according to  provincial Human Resources Minister Bill Vander Zaim, means that they  can't use daycare facilities unless  they pay their way. Thus, despite a  growing need for daycare, immigrant  women and students are going  without-unless they have the $150  or more a month needed per child to  pay for daycare. The withdrawal of  subsidies for immigrants and students also means hardships for  childcare centres which must have a  full house in order to receive  enough government money to operate efficiently.

One night, after drinking, she awoke  to her husband beating her. she shot and killed him.  At trial, Linklater testified that she had meant to kill herself  in her husband's presence, not shoot him. Her defence  lawyer argued that her action was a culmination of a marriage filled with drunkenness and violence. Her lawyer argued that, as she was drunk at the time, she should be  charged with manslaughter, not murder.  The all-white jury deliberated only three hours then returned  with a verdict: guilty of second degree murder. The white  Yukon Supreme Court judge sentenced Linklater to life imprisonment She will be sent  to   Kingston   Prison   for  Women in Ontario, leaving  her newborn baby behind.  The system that judged  Linklater,   an  Aboriginal  woman, should be contrasted with the system that  judged Ernest Riggs, a white  man, a year earlier. Riggs  beat his wife to death. The  BC Supreme Court judge  bought his defence: that he  was "drunk beyond  his  control." Riggs was found  guilty of a lesser charge of  manslaughter  and   sentenced to 2 1  months in  prison and two years probation.

DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Tobique Women take the long  walk to Ottawa  Indigenous women and children marched from the Tobique Reserve  in New Brunswick to Parliament Hill in Ottawa to call attention to  poor housing conditions in their community and to provisions in the  Indian Act that allows band councils to discriminate against  women. In Ottawa, the women appealed directly to new Prime  Minister Joe Clark to investigate living conditions on their reserve  for women raising children alone.  Despite a three-month occupation of the band council office in 1977 and  a petition to the UN Human Rights Committee in 1978, the women's names  are still at the bottom of the list for new houses while they remain in  overcrowded buildings in need of repair. They say they had appealed to  the Department of Indian Affairs, the Canadian Human Rights Commission  and the courts, but did not get anywhere with them.  Sandra Lovelace, who signed the petition to the UN, said she hopes  the international body will put pressure on the Canadian government to remove the section from the Indian Act that forces a  woman to give up her "Indian status" and treaty rights on marriage  to a non-Native man.

Marion Barling  Any inequality between the sexes under the Unemployment Insurance regulations are the result of  nature not legislation. That's what the Supreme Court of Canada said when they ruled 7-0 against  Stella Bliss. Bliss, who had been excluded from regular UI benefits under Section 46 of the Unemployment Insurance Act because she just had a child, claimed that Section 46 contravenes the  Canadian Bill of Rights by discriminating against her on that basis that she is a woman.  Essentially, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 46 does not discriminate on the basis of sex; it  only discriminates against pregnant people and therefore pregnancy discrimination does not equal  sex discrimination. The decision is a kick in the stomach to all working women, especially those  30,000 a year who are denied regular benefits because they are pregnant. (November 1978)  z\   Women's building opens in Winnipeg  A beautiful three storey brick building with a stage and hall offices, and social  and recreational space will be the new home for many women's organizations in  Winnipeg. T he building was purchased on October 1978 by the Winnipeg Women's Cultural and Educational Centre Inc. in response to the needs of the women's community.  The Winnipeg Women's Building makes a radical departure from the general  practice of renting old houses, garages or office space for women's groups.  "We wanted a large building that we owned ourselves, where we would have  room to have social functions and businesses and other fundraising activities.. " says Joan Campbell of WWCEC.  Already a second-hand store has opened in the Women's Building, and plans  are afoot for a bookstore, a graphics collective, a women's coffeehouse, and  a women's theatre company. Many women's organizations are also in the  process of moving in—Women in Trades, Wages Due Lesbians, Wages for  Housework, Lesbian Counselling Group, and Winnipeg Women's Liberation.  A single mothers' group, a group producing women's programs on public TV,  and a Native women's organization are among other groups planning to use  the Women's Building. (February 1979)  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Getting lire geers  A number of women's groups are  challenging the rampant sexism in  the engineering department of UBC  by laying a complaint with the BC  Human Rights Branch. The complaint  alleges that the pornographic and  sexist publications and activities of  the Undergraduate Engineering  Society discourages women from  entering the department and creates  a discriminatory climate within the  university. The UBC peers' are also  known for their infamous annual  "Lady Godiva" ride, for which they  hire a woman to ride naked on a  horse through the campus with drunk  students running behind.

Lovelace, who is Maliseet from Tobique Reserve in  New Brunswick has been trying to get re-instated as a "status Indian." She, and several other women, are challenging Section  12(1)(b) of the Indian Act which strips Aboriginal women of their  status if they marry non-Aboriginal men.

The recently formed BC Domestics Association met with Heinrich and pressed  him to extend the laws to apply to domestic workers when his Socred government introduces amendments,  expected later in the year. Heinrich was non-committal, at best. The association is talking to SORWUC about  unionizing domestic workers.

If a woman has diabetes, multiple sclerosis,  cancer of the uterus, she may be eligible for an  abortion.  ... If a woman has three children, a husband out of  work, and is so depressed she can't sleep or look  after her children because of her distress at being  unwillingly pregnant, she would not be able to have  an abortion.  No abortions have been done at Victoria General Hospital for over a month. The hospital's anti-abortion committee  rejected all but a few applications in January and February.

The g-rouP also  prepared a form letter to be sent to frederick baton, president  OF   THE  DEPARTMENT  STORE   EMPIRE.   (APRIL   Ii23)  Umbrella Die-in  On May 24, women in Vancouver marked the International Day for Women and Disarmament with a "die-in." The theme of the anti-nuclear protest was "umbrella of defence," a  direct challenge to the "umbrella agreement" which allows the OS to test war weaponry in  northern Alberta. Demonstrators staged actions at the Canadian Armed Forces recruiting  office and major financial centres, and also marched on the OS Consulate.  (June 1983)  Occupation at iiiA  It started on July 20: 50 Aboriginal women walked info tne  Department 01 Indian Aiiairs regional office in Vancouver and  began tneir occupation, iwo Jays later, tnere were 120 women  inside. For eignt days, tne protesters tried" to talk to DIA officials about tne deplorable living conditions in tneir communities.

And on tne eigntli day, wnen tne protesters relused to abide by a  court injunction ordering tnem to leave the DIA office, police  came in and dragged tnem out. JTilty-tnree women were arrested  and charged with mischief.  (July/August  1981)  Testimonials from Older Women  On August 28, the Vancouver Status of Women sponsored a one-day speak-out by older women. "Women Growing Older:  Testimonials" was part of Palindromes: On Women Aging, a multimedia, multisensory exhibition and series of related events.  The idea behind the speak-out was to create a space where older women could share their perceptions on aging, stereotypes, and the specific concerns they have as older women in this society. (September 1983)  In July, all regular employees at the Vancouver Transition House received termination notices. By  March 31,1984, the provincial government plans to contract the house out to a private organization.  Vancouver Transition House opened its doors in December 1973, becoming the first refuge for  battered women and children. In 1978, it officially joined with the Ministry of Human Resources, and  since that time has been the only government operated resource for battered women and children  in Canada.  Workers at Vancouver Transition House have condemned the Social Credit government's move  to privatize the facility. (November 1983)  Boycotting Collins & CKVU  Despite the rain, more than 200 demonstrators turned up on the steps of CKVU television in Vancouver June 16 to protest Doug  Collins' endorsement of violence against  women. Women's groups demanded CKVU  retract the statement. It refused.  On the May 12th edition of "Vancouver  Show" unleashed a barrage of criticisms  against the newly funded feminist group Media Watch. Said Collins: "If there is ever another conventional war, it is my hope that Media Watch and its army of snoops will be found  in the front lines where they can be raped by  the Russians. "Collins called his remarks "fun."  (July/August 1983)  Women got the last laugh though.  On August 17, the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission censured CKVU.  Ottawa Mothers Refuse the Cruise  A coalition of women's groups from Montreal, Ottawa and Kingston  converged on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Mothers' Day to protest  the proposed testing of cruise missiles in north- J  ern Alberta. Three thousand women, their children and male supporters slipped past an  RCMP barricade and clasped hands to form  a human chain around the Centre Block. The  RCMP had earlier refused the women a permit to protest.

Women occupy transition house  Vancouver Transition House officially closed on June 28th, when the YWCA  pulled out of its contract to provide transition house services at the facility.  Since then, a group of women, many of whom work with battered women,  have been occupying VTH in a bid to ensure that battered women and  children have access to critical services. (The YWCA had been running  VTH since April 1, 7 994 after the provincial government put 22 publicly-run  social services facilities on the privatization market.)  In September, the Salvation Army and Act II picked up the contracts to provide transition house services in Vancouver. The Salvation Army will operate a 12-bed hostel (Kate Booth House) with a maximum stay of two weeks.  Act II, a private company, will operate a series of residences for follow-up  work with women who have left battering situations.  The occupiers of VTH say they will continue their occupation because it is  not clear what services the Salvation Army and Act II will provide. They will  also continue calling for the reinstatement of a government-operated (funded)  feminist transition house. (October 1985)  In January 1986, the women ended their occupation afterthe VancouverCity  Council agreed to seek funding from senior levels of government for a city-  operated transition house. No funding ever materialized and Kate Booth  House remains the only transition house in Vancouver.  CBTC Refuses To ReeUkaTe  Women held rallies across the country on  January 18 to protest recent decisions by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications  Commission that relax the regulations on Pay TV  stations. The CRTC has said it will not regulate  pornographic programming, nor would it prohibit  programs that could be considered sexist, racist  or abusive of any religion or creed. (February  1984)  Local  girls basketball stars  Two Port Coquitlam girls lay a few sport myths to rest wnen tney almost single-handedly  defeated a local toys' basketball team. Jacquie DesLauriers and Sherry Larson, both members  of tne girls' basketball team at Hazel Trembath School, were asked to replace two injured  members of the boys' team in a game against James Park School. James Park usually beats  Jjrernbath, but not this time. DesLauriers and Larson lead their school to a 72-TO victory,  scoring 60 of the 72 points. Both say they like playing on the girls' team better! (March T984)  Activists sentenced  Julie  Belmas,   Ann  Hansen and three others—known as  the \ancouver  Five—were sentenced to lengthy terms  in  jail after pleading guilty to the bombings at the  Litton  Systems plant  in Ontario,  the Cheehye-Dunsmuir nuclear  sub-station in BC,  and three Red Hot Video stores.  Belmas and  Hansen  are well-known feminist  and anti-  nuclear activists.  They are being transferred to Kingston  Prison for Women. (July/August 1984)  Abortions Stopped in Northern BC  The local hospital board in Smithers, BC disbanded its Therapeutic Abortion Committee October 3rd. Two weeks later, it reinstated the TAC, but appointed doctors who are opposed to abortion. The move leaves women in Smithers and surrounding communities without access to safe abortion services. For women in  those areas, their only option now is to go to Vancouver, 20 hours  away.

Participants  shared information and identified concerns. One critical issue raised was  the low priority given by the women's  movement to ensuring its resources,  activities and spaces are accessible  to women with disabilities. Inspired  by the three-day gathering, the women  returned to their communities to work  on starting up provincial  DAWNs.(September 1985)  The Vancouver Lesbian Connection  is opening up Canada's first and only lesbian  centre September 5th at 876 Commercial Drive.  The main goal is to get lesbian groups together in one  space to facilitate information exchange and support  and to create a focal point for the lesbian  community. The Lesbian Information Line has  donated 25 percent of their total budget to pay  for the VLC's phone lines for the  next year.  (September 1985)  Reinstatement bill doesn't go far enough  For more than a decade, Aboriginal women  have been challenging the discrimination in the  Indian Act, even taking their fight as far as the  United Nations. On February 28, when Minister of  Indian Affairs David Crombie introduced Bill C-31,  the women received a partial victory.  Bill C-31 does reinstate Aboriginal women who  lost their status under Section 12(1 )(b) of the Indian Act when they married non-Aboriginal men.  However, the women reinstated will not necessarily be able to transmit status to their children and  grandchildren. Even with status, the women and  their children are not guaranteed membership in  their bands.

In BC, a lesbian employed by the provincial government is  also waging a similar battle. (March 1986)  Motherpeace Eight saved by the tides  Eight women, acquitted of trespassing on Department of National Defense, have the movements  of the sea to thank. The anti-nuclear activists were conducting a Motherpeace Action on the  shores of Winchelsea Island (off Vancouver Island) last August when they were arrested.  Winchelsea Island is the site of the Candian Forces Maritime and Experimental Test Range.  Because the Motherpeace Eight held their symbolic protest picnic below the high watertide mark,  they could not be convicted of trespassing. Only property above that mark belongs to DND.  The women are now ready for another action! (February 1987)  Bankworkers win contract  heered as the Ca-  loard imposed a tirst contract on their em-  mperial  Bank  or  Commerce.

After more  than  20 years  of continuous  struggle,   Canadian women  are  now  tree  to have  an  abortion  anytime  they choose.  In  a  5  to  2   decision,   the   Supreme   Court  of  Canada  ruled  that  Doctors   Henry  Morgentaler,   Leslie   Smoling  and  Robert  Scott  must  he   acquitted  on   charges  of  "procuring  a  miscarriage"--that  is,   performing  ahortions.  The   decision   states   that   Section   251,   the   section   regulating   ahortion   in   the  Criminal Code, violates Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,  which   guarantees   "life,   liberty  and  the   security  of  the  person."  Ontario   Coalition  for  Ahortion   Clinics   spokesperson  Judy  Rehich  described  the  ruling as  a  "total victory for the  pro-choice  movement,   hut warns:   "We  may have  won,   hut people  will  try  and  stop  us."

The oldest and  largest local, Local 1, of the Service Office and Retail Union of Canada (SORWUC)—predominantly a women's union—folded in February. Local 1 held contracts for 14 bargaining units representing workers in daycares, social services, theatres and neighbourhood pubs.  Local 1 was established as the first SORWUC local when  the union started in 1972. During its history, Local 1 led a  number of well-known strikes, including at Bimini's Pub and  the Muckamuck Restaurant in Vancouver.  Local 1 was forced to fold primarily because of the deepening recession in BC and the growing anti-union climate  among employers and the provincial government.  (May 1987)  Federal report dismisses quality childcare  The federal governments recently released special committee report on  childcare has been widely condemned by feminists, labour and childcare  activists, as well as the two non-Tory members of the committee (who  wrote dissenting reports).  Although the vast majority of briefs presented to the committee called  for direct funding to non-profit childcare centres, the Conservative-dominated committee instead focused on a limited system of tax credits to  parents. The committee also recommends federal-provincial cost-sharing of operating grants to licensed centres, but does not limit grants to  non-profit centres, opening the doors for a flurry of daycares-for-profit  (May 1987)  HERdlei*  "This woman is not on trial"  MORE HOMEM DIE  IN CHILD BIRTH  THAN IN LEGAL  ABORriONS  in/i other cowman  MOWERS HAVE A  BETTER CHANCE OF  LIVING THROUGH  CHILDBIRTH  JO% DE INFANTS  THAT DIE DO SO  FROM POVERTf  COAID/riOMS  Those words from BC Ministry of Social Services  and Housing's lawyer Tom Gove elicited peels of  hooting from women attending the final day o  hearings in the Baby B case at the New Westminster courthouse. M  The case itself is no laughing matter; the impli- \lv ^  cations are very serious. It began on May 20, when \Jk |  a woman in labour entered Grace Hospital in Van- s3^  couver. She was told the baby was in a feetling  breech position and would die or be seriously injured  if she didn't have a caesarean section. The woman refused. The attending physician then called MSSH to And a way to force her to have the surgery. A ministry  social worker agreed to apprehend herunborn child. The woman later agreed to  have a caesarean, and gave birth to a healthy baby. But by then it was too late,  MSSH had already made the decision to apprehend.  During the five-day hearing on whether MSSH had the right to apprehend an unborn child, Gove put the woman's lifestyle on trial Unfortunately, the judge bought  his "bad mother line of argument Justice Brian Davis ruled that when a baby is  near term and birth is imminent the superintendent of MSSH can apprehend if  the mother does not agree to "necessary" medical attention. The ruling means  the rights of a woman are secondary to the "rights" of her fetus. (October 1987)  Ironically, MSSH lawyer Tom Gove would later become Justice Thomas Gove, best  known for the "Gove Report "a seaming renew of the child welfare system in BC.  Feminists have criticized his report released in 1996, as focusing only on the  welfare of children wmiliWemenmn of the well-being of their mothers. The NDP  government responded to the Gove Report by creating me Ministry for Children  and Families. Increased apprehensions followed.  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Sensational assault trial leads to lenient sentence  It was an event the media wouldn't have missed for the world. Why would  they, since they had a hand in creating it.  The trial had drawn to a close and Kirby Inwood was found guilty of assaulting his wife and their infant son. The media were all excited. His sentence: a mere 30 days in jail. Women were furious.  The story started out as a "fairytale." Inwood had gone to the Soviet Union  and met and "fell in love" with Tatayana Sidorova. Upon his return to Canada,  he mounted a major publicity campaign to have her be allowed to emigrate  from the USSR.  In September 1987, Sidorova and their son Misha arrived in Canada. Ten  days later, Inwood was arrested for assaulting Sidorova and, among other  things, twice dropping Misha on his head.  During the trial. Judge Gordon Hachborn allowed Inwood's lawyer to viciously interrogate Sidorova, trying everything to destroy her credibility.  Hachborn, however, did not allow five women who had been brutally assaulted  by Inwood to testify, until the sentencing hearing. (October 1988)  As well as being known as a convicted wife beater, Kirby Inwood is also  known as a very vocal father's rights advocate and virulent anti-feminist. Not  surprisingly, he was welcomed with open arms by members of the Joint Committee on Child Custody during its hearing in Toronto in the Spring of 1998.  B@0s 88ff83 a  Outside, volunteer marshals line the wooden barricades, wearing bright orange vests and grim expressions. About 303 protesters parade, with picket  signs and gaudy pictures of aborted fetuses.  The date is November 4, 1988. Abortion is legal.  Eighty-seven percent of Canadians support a woman's right to choose. Everywoman's Health Clinic,  BC's first freestanding abortion clinic, finally opens  its doors.  Three weeks later, Hilda Thomas of the BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics,which established  Everywoman's, says women have been calling from  all over BC and as far away as Edmonton. "Our  phone lines were barely open when women began  booking appointments." (December/January 1989)  It is important that the women's movement be aware of and  responsive to the needs of women who work and live under  conditions which do not necessarily reflect those of the  majority  Murders linked to anti-soliciting law  The killings of Rose Peters and Margaret Bedan in a single week this April have brought the count to 21 sex-trade  workers in BC, known to have been murdered since 1985. The murders began in February that year with the death  of 18-year old Nicky Tatrai.  At a recent demonstration in Vancouver intended to bring public attention to the murders, POWER (Prostitutes and  Other Women for Equal Rights) linked the killings directly to Bill C-49, the anti-soliciting law. POWER says the law  has increased the vulnerability of sex-trade workers. After Bill C-49 was introduced in 1985, many women, including many of those murdered, received court injunctions restricting them from working in areas familiar to them  where they had some methods of safety. As well, police harassment has forced women to work alone rather than  in pairs, and into dark alleys. (May 1988)  Abortion Back on Trial  "Once upon a time, in a province far away, there was a  health clinic called the  Centre de  sante des  femmes de Montreal. The  women at this clinic  went about their work, doing referrals, examinations and,  among other things, arranging for women to have abortions. Business as usual.  Until one day in July 1989,  an injunction was launched  against Chantal Daigle,  prohibiting her from having an abortion."  Daigle's abusive ex-boyfriend was successful in  getting an injunction to  prevent her from having an  abortion, which she had  chosen to do. Across the  country, women responded  with rallies in support of  women's reproductive  rights and choices. And in  the end, the Supreme Court  of Canada dismissed the injunction.  (September 1989)  FaBMWoRfeeRS HiT  ttaRD b$t Ut GUTS  More than 1,200 South Asians  rallied on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery May 6th to  protest the proposed, changes to  the unemployment insurance  legislation. The proposals will  increase the number of weeks of  work required to qualify for X7I;  cut the number of weeks of benefits paid; and reduce the percentage of earnings paid from 60 to  50 percent.  The march and rally -was held  particularly in support of  farmworkers. As their -work is  seasonal, most -will be severely  impacted under the new X7I regime. According to the Canadian  Farmworkers Union, there are  approximately 28,000 farm  workers in BC. Of these, 78 to 82  percent are women; another five  to eight percent are seniors,  "...the season for farm -work is delayed this year on account of the  severe winter... so -we shan't be  going to work until the end of  May or early June," says Amar  Kaur. "How on earth can -we ever  find enough weeks to work on  BC's farms to qualify for X7IC."  (June  1989)  Pregnancy discrimination  =sexdiscrimination  Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy-  is discrimination on the basis of sex,  says the Supreme Court of Canada. The  case involves three women who work as  part-time cashiers for Canada Safeway in  Manitoba.  The women challenged Safeway's policy of  excluding pregnant women from receiving  accident or sickness benefits for a 17-  week period. In siding with the women,  the Supreme Court stated that pregnancy  is a valid, health-related reason for  leaving work and may not be singled out  for disadvantageous treatment.  The court's decision quashes its previous ruling on pregnancy discrimination  in the Bliss case, in which it concluded  the opposite. (June 1989)  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999 Women express  their rage  More than 300 women stood outside  the Vancouver courthouse and let  out a collective wail of rage against  child sexual abuse, demanding that  a judge who called a three-year old  girl "sexually aggressive" be removed from the bench. The women  gathered three days after county  court Judge Peter van der Hoop  gave a suspended sentence to  Delbert Leeson, who admitted to  sexually abusing the girl.  (December/January 1990)  Anger is what is  needed, anger at  the conditions of  an oppressive  society and at the  people who keep  it that way. Without anger there  won't be any  change.  " w  Honk  FOR  CENTRES  rife*  Women's Programs slashed:  No centres, no staff, no service!  Canadian womens centres and publications  have been devastated by budget cuts to the  federal Womens Programs, in BC, Quebec and  Newfoundland, an estimated 100 local centres  have had their operational funding completely  eliminated under the Conservative government's  February budget. This translates into a $1.6  million—or 15 percent—cut to the Womens  Program, a department of the Secretary of State.  Since 1989, the program has been whittled away  by 30 percent, in the name of "deficit reduction."  SecState rationalizes the 100 percent cut to  womens centres by saying that the funding of  "services" is inconsistent with the Women's  Program mandate. Work involving advocacy  and public education to improve the status of  women is considered eligible. (March 1990)  Lfclen to what wo hove lo toy  "It's time for the mainstream feminist  movement to listen to what women of  colour have to say."  That was the call echoing from the New  Ideas for a New Decade gathering sponsored by the Vancouver Status of Women  on March 14. The theme of the evening:  "feminism and political change."  Colours (a collective of women of colour  and Aboriginal women), representatives of  Aquelarre (a Latin American women's  magazine), and the women's caucus of the  South Asia Student Association used plays,  skits and dialogues to analyze racism and  to show how the concerns and voices of  women of colour are excluded by the  agenda of the mainstream feminist movement. (April 1990)  **** (fourteen women gunned down in Vriontteat +++*  December 6th, 1989: At the engineering pavilion of L'Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, 14  women were gunned down and 13 other female and male students were wounded by a man  who hated women. The women who died were: Genevieve Bergeron, Helene Colgan,  Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Barbara  Maria Klutcznik, Maryse Laganiere, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier,  Michele Richard, Annie St-Arneault and Annie Turcotte.  A letter was found on the gunman's body—he committed suicide—in which he claimed  feminists had ruined his life. In spite of this evidence, the view that the massacre was "an  isolated act of a madman" is prevalent in the mainstream media. Events occurring across  the country in the aftermath of the massacre point out this is definitely not the case:  • On December 10 in Orillia, Ontario, a boy walks into his Grade 12 electronics class and points  a water pistol at his only female classmate. "You're a feminist," he says, pulling the trigger.  • In Edmonton, four weeks after the massacre, male engineering students chant, "Shoot the  bitch," when a female student takes the stage in a university skit. (February 1990)  Shelter for Aboriginal Women  In March, the BC provincial government confirmed core and operational funding for a Native  women's transition house to be located in  Vancouver. The Helping Spirit Lodge  Society, the group that will administer the shelter, is investigating either  buying a building or having one built  to their specifications. If all goes well,  they plan to open by September 1990  with an all Aboriginal staff.  (April 1990)  The fight is on  Spring 1990 will be remembered as the season  when feminists raised a huge public cry against  funding cuts to the Secretary of State's Women's  Programs.  Women in St. Johns, Newfoundland were the first to  stage a full-fledged occupation of a SecState office. On March 26, the 60 women announced "the  newest women's centre in Canada," and set about  using SecState's telephones and fax machine to  get what they had come fa: a meeting with the federal minister responsible for Women's Programs,  Gerry Weiner. The goal is full reinstatement of core  funding to women's centres and publications.  Public support was widespread and immediate.  Groups are receiving donations and demonstrations are well-attended. Even the mainstream media can't help but paint a sympathetic portrait of  the local women's centre, struggling to survive.  The feds have responded by trying to lure women's groups with offers of short term project funding. That has been the governments' standard  strategy ever since the cuts were first announced.  However, women are showing no tendency to let  up the pressure. On Equality Day, April 17, numerous "Weiner Roasts" were held across the country.  The same day, women in Vancouver interrupted a  public speech by Justice Minister Kim Campbell,  urging herto support the call for full funding.  (May 1990)  The feminist fightback was successful in restoring some of the funding cut to women's centres,  but not to publications. Since 1990, the budget for  Women's Programs (now under Status of Women  Canada) has continued to decline and earlier this  year, SWC replaced all program funding with  project funding.  KINESIS  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 ^ First project on women and AIDS^  The Women and AIDS project opened its doors in Vancouver in the  same week the BC government began its highly public pursuit of a  young HIV-positive sex trade worker, charged under the provincial  "Quarantine" legislation. That meant, Canada's first federally funded  project on women and HIV/AIDS got little media attention.  The new project was developed by a group of women who met  through AIDS Vancouver. Its focus will be mainly on public education  V and developing resource materials. (June 1990)  (S©©(3 Q©&©  A text book model of top-down, male-  centred, racist and exclusive decisionmaking, the Meech [Lake Constitutional]  Accord was never well-understood, let  alone accepted by the majority of people  in Canada. Perhaps this was because the  1990 Fathers of Confederation were lying.  Meech was intended to recognize  Quebec as a "distinct society," but in  doing so, it shut out the "distinct" voices  and issues of Aboriginal peoples, women,  immigrants, and people living in the North.  As well as its exclusionary process, the  main criticism by feminists of the Meech  Lake Accord is it would lead to the  demise of national standards for existing  (and any new) social programs. (July/  August 1990)  Many feminists in Quebec countered those criticisms, saying that  "distinct society" encompasses Quebec 's tradition of upholding women's  rights and progressive attitudes. Meech  failed to pass.  ...the classic line,  the one all women  of colour [know]:  "so, where are you  from?"  New abortion law  sows death, confusion  Barely a month after passing through Parliament, Canada's new abortion legislation-Bill C-  43-has left one young woman dead, another recovering in hospital, and the women of Canada  in a state of mass confusion. All this, and the bill  has yet to become law.  Bill C-43 recriminalizes abortion, but allows  for it in cases where a doctor believes continuing the pregnancy would damage a woman's  physical, mental or psychological health.  'There is a general sense of panic out there,"  says Kim Zander of the BC Coalition for Abortion  Clinics. "Many believe abortion is now illegal.  Women are calling asking questions about the  law. They think there is now no clinic... they are  fearful that they have no rights."  In June, Yvonne Jurewicz of Toronto died after a self-induced abortion. (July/August 1990)  Pandora pressed by threats  The silencing of Halifax's feminist  newspaper. Pandora, took a turn for the  worse in November when mainstream  media coverage of the human rights complaint against the newspaper resulted in  a death threat to the collective.  Pandora is being charged with "sex  discrimination," after a well-known anti-  feminist, "fathers' rights" advocate filed a  complaint against the newspaper because it would not print his letter to the  editor. In August, the Nova Scotia Human  Rights Commission ruled there were  grounds to pursue the complaint and sent it to a tribunal.  The death threat, left on Pandora's answering machine, came just a  few days after death and rape notes were received by the eight women  editors of Surface, a student newspaper at Queen's University.(December/  January 1992)  Pandora did win its case, but not without great cost to the women  involved. Two years after the tribunal's decision, the collective—still burnt  out and in serious debt—decided to shut the newspaper down. The case  had cost Pandora $40,000 to fight (although much of the legal fees was  waived); Pandora had revenues of $4,000 a year.  ^Juw* fetter wm\ should espouse.

(March J 991)  Defining consent  Proposed amendments to Canada's sexual  assault laws, announced in December by Justice  Minister Kim Campbell, have been received by  women's groups with a mixture of hope and  skepticism. Campbell's Bill C-49 came about after  the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the" rape  shield law," enacted in 1983 to protect a woman  from being cross-examined about her prior sexual  history.  The proposed law provides strict guidelines  on when a rape victim's sexual past is admissible,  and also includes a definition of "consent," which  puts the onus on the accused to ensure consent  existed. Bill C-49 is commonly referred to as the "no  means no" bill.  While women's groups hailed the bill as an  important step, they also expressed concerns that  the government has not addressed the sexism and  racism within the judicial system. Still, the loudest  opposition to the bill comes from powerful patriarchal quarters: the Canadian Bar Association and  the Criminal Lawyers Association, among others.  (February & June 1982)  The bill did become law, but its constitutionality has been challenged ever since. One such challenge, concerning Steven Ewanchuk of Alberta, will  soon be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.  Although Ewanchuk had spent 10 years in prison  for previous convictions of sexual assault, the trial  and appeal judges in his current case ruled that the  17-year old woman involved had "consented."  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Another breast implant scanaal  A year ago, Linda Wilson of Delta, BC was hard-pressed to get  anyone to listen to her concerns about the health hazards of  silicone-gel breast implants. But things have changed.  In February, the US Food and Drug Administration announced  a moratorium on the implants. A month later, the largest  manufacturer of silicone implants, Dow Corning, tried to offer  women free replacement implants and $600, if they agreed  not to sue.  Wilson and other breast implant wearers, including  NDP MP Joy Langan, are taking the challenge back to  federal Health Minister Benoit Bouchard. They say  the feds knew silicone implants had not been fully  checked out for safety before being unleashed on  women in Canada. (April 1992)  Wilson was critical in the successful fight, a year  earlier, to get the Meme breasr implant pulled off the  Canadian and American markets. Like the manufacturer of the Meme, Dow Coming has declared bankruptcy While some compensation settlements have  been reached, many more are still in limbo as implant  manufacturers deny any links between their products  and the health ailments of breast-implanted women.  NAFTA#   NAFTA,   we  don't hafta  MIDWIVES WIN  THEIR DAY IN COURT  When the Supreme Court of  Canada acquitted midwives  Mary Sullivan and Gloria LeMay on  May 21st, the court merely re-affirmed its  position that a fetus is not "a person" under  the Criminal Code.  In 1986, Sullivan and LeMay, lay midwives  from Vancouver, were convicted of criminal  negligence causing death to a baby which  suffocated after becoming stuck in its  mother's body during a home birth. They  were acquitted on a second charge of (  criminal negligence causing harm  to the mother.  (April 1991)  April 18th: "It's on to Ottawa." Taking  off from Courtney, BC in the West and St  John's, Newfoundland in the East, the caravans headed towards Parliament Hill to protest the  North American Free Trade Agreement.  Women were a major part of the success of the cross-  Canada trek. "Everywhere we went, there were large  numbers of women out, playing strong leadership  roles-everything from a singing group in Castlegar,  BC, to key speakers from labour groups, to the  Raging Grannies, theatre groups, women from church  organizations, from every sector you can imagine,"  says Ellen Woodsworth of the BC Action Canada Network and Women to Women Global Strategies.  May 15th: "We've arrived." Action Canada Network's  "vehicle of democracy" leads in more than 900 buses and  no-one-knows-how-many cars for a massive demonstration on  Parliament Hill. By plane, train, bicycle, foot  people  converge on Parliament Hill. The whole square, as far as one can see  in any direction, is filled with thousands and thousands of people,  representing a powerful social movement.  (June 1993)  Miss Saigon: Not a love Story  Members and supporters of Asian Revisions  rallied in front of the Princess of Wales Theatre in  Toronto on May 26, the  opening night of the musical Miss Saigon.  Miss Saigon is the latest in a long string of artistic productions written  by white people about  people of colour that to-  photo by Siew Chin Chio  No voice for Aboriginal women  in Charlottetown  Since June 1991, the Native Women's Association of Canada  has been demanding a voice in the talks on constitutional renewal. Despite an appeal court ruling in their favour, the federal  and provincial governments and national Aboriginal groups  continue to deny Aboriginal women a role in drafting the  Charlottetown Accord. Sharon Mclvor, a member of NWAC's  executive, says the Accord promises nothing new for Aboriginal  peoples. In particular, she says the Charlottetown Accord does  not guarantee Aboriginal self-government; it only puts in place  the process for negotiation that was already there. The Accord  means little more than that Aboriginal peoples can administer  their own poverty. (November 1992)  Making the Links   More than 1,500 women came together in Toronto for a groundbreaking  conference aimed at exploring the connections between anti-racism and  feminism. Put on by the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, Making the Links drew an an unprecedented number of  anti-racist and feminist activists from across the country and around the  world. For the first time at a national meeting of mainstream women's  organizations, more than three-quarters attending were women of  colour and Aboriginal women.  Fifty workshops, roundtables and panels during the three-day conference  enabled participants to explore strategies and initiate political alliances across  recognized differences based in class, race, age, ability, sexual preference  and geographical boundaries. (December/January 1993)  tally distorts reality. It tells the story of Kim, a 17-year old Vietnamese woman bought one  night by Chris, a white American soldier. Years later, when Chris returns to Vietnam looking for Kim, she begs him to take their child to America to "save" him from a life of destitution. She then kills herself. (July/August 1993)  Shrouded in secrecy reminiscent of the release of the  federal budget, the Canadian Panel on Violence Against  Women released its report at the end of July without  notifying or providing copies to women's organizations.  Only a few of the representatives from women's organizations, who happened to be in Ottawa or were able to get  there on very short notice, attended the press conference  and received a copy of the report.  The Panel has been severely criticized in the past for its  lack of accountability to the women's movement and accessibility to women. A year ago, four national women's  groups—the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women, DisAbled Women's Network, the Congress of Black  Women and the Canadian Association of Sexual Assault  Centres—pulled out of the Panel's 23-member advisory  committee, after the minister responsible for the status of  women refused to hold consultations with national women's  groups or appoint women with disabilities and more  women of colour to the Panel. (September 1993)  Just What  Does  "NO  MEANS  NO"  MEAN?  —| consent and Power Don't Mix f-  Seven years of fighting with the justice system has come to a fruitful end for Laura  Norberg of Williams Lake, BC. On June 18, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that she  was sexually exploited by her doctor. Her doctor, on numerous occasions, offered her  prescription drugs, to which she was addicted, in exchange for sex.  The court's ruling qualifies the definition of consent. "The court has recognized that in  analyzing claims of sexual assault, you must appreciate any power relationships between the parties and this is critical in distinguishing between voluntary consent and  forced submission to sexual activity," says Helena Orton of the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund.  "For women with disabilities, the power imbalance with medical professionals is  heightened because the doctor-patient relationship is often a long-standing one," says  Joan Meister of the DisAbled Women's Network Canada. (July/August 1992)  KffiSlS  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 Victory for Del-gam Uukw  It took almost nine years, but the persistence of Del-gam  Uukw, a hereditary Gitxsan chief, and 34 other Gitxsan  and Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs has paid off. In a  unanimous decision, the BC Court of Appeal ruled that  Aboriginal rights in BC exist and were never extinguished  by colonial governments. This ruling overturns the 1991  BC Supreme Court decision from Chief Justice Allan  McEachern, which dismissed most of the Gitxsan-  Wet'suwet'en claim.  The court of appeal, though, is split on the issue of what  rights the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en maintained—three of  the five justices sided with McEachern, narrowly limiting  the unextinguished rights of the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en  to traditional uses of their land. (September 1993)  The Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In December 1997, the Supreme Court  upheld that Aboriginal title had never been extinguished,and that  the use of oral histories in determining rights and territorial claims  was valid.  Boycotting   Sex  Selection  The Coalition of South Asian  Women's Organizations in Vancouver is calling for a boycott of  four South Asian newspapers, after they refused to remove ads run  by an American doctor, John  Stevens. Through the newspapers,  Stevens has been marketing sex  selection services at his clinic in  Blaine, Washington. The Coalition  says targeting the South Asian  community plays into racist stereotypes. (October 1993)  "The old grey mare just ain't what.she used  to be," sings a group of Raging Grannies.  "She's an activist now." More than 150  women, gathered for a weekend of affirmation of aging in a society that favours youth,  hoot and applaud as four Raging Grannies  ready their vocal chords for another tune.  Besides singing, women also reclaimed  words that can be used to make positive  references to post-menopausal women. By  the end of the weekend, several women  insisted on signing up for the next year's  retreat, even though the organizers swore  this was a one-time event.  (December/January 1994)  NO GOING  BACK!  More than 400 people gathered outside the Liberal  Party's headquarters in  Toronto on April 22nd to say  "No to Sergio Marchi's head  tax." The demonstration,  organized by the Toronto  Coalition Against Racism,  targeted the Liberal government's new $975 "head tax,"  charged to every aduit immigrant and refugee applying to  become a Canadian resident.  As Winnie Ng of the National  Action Committee on the  Status of Women notes, "the  racist and sexist nature of  the tax will put women and  children from the South in  the most vulnerable  positions."  (May 1995)  De-Kleining  Alberta  With his radical experiment in reducing the role  of the state, Alberta's  premier Ralph Klein may  be setting a trend for the  governance of Canada.  Making sure cuts are  speedy and deep, a relentless Klein made it hard for  activists to absorb the impact and rally opposition. But  thousands of high school students defied Klein and walked  out of their classes in protest. The premier threatened to  invoke truancy legislation against the parents of the  students, including jail time and $500 fines. (October 1994)  Royal Commission on NRTs:  Less, in 1,200 pages  "Proceed with Care" is the title of the report produced by the Royal Commission  on New Reproductive Technologies. The report was released to the public—or  rather, to a select group of invited mainstream media representatives—on  November 30.  Feminists who have been involved in the NRT debate for years criticize the  report for, among other things, not adequately addressing the causes of  infertility, not examining NRTs within a broader social context, and not  coming out strongly enough against the commercialization of NRTs.  The Commission's history has not been a smooth one, with repeated   TV/akming,: t-  extensions, the firing of four commissioners, accusations of financial    l^J^r^*TM^"^?/  mismanagement, and a boycott of its "consultations" by the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women. Clearly, the report canno'  be called "Proceeded with Consultation." (February 1994)  Marching  against  violence  in the  Downtown  Eastside  Alice Allin after her croning  On Valentine's Day,  February 14th, more than  150 people gathered at  Carnegie Centre in Vancouver's Downtown  Eastside to commemorate the women who  have been murdered in  the community. They  then walked through the  neighbourhood, stopping  at places where women's bodies have been  found. "Fifty women  have been killed in the  Downtown Eastside in  the last 10 years," says  Vivien Sandy, one of the  march's organizers. "The  majority of those murders  have not been solved.  Most of the women killed  were Native. The police  tick these off as  unimportant."  This is the third year the  march has been held.

The Coalition quickly  planned a series of action to counter media accounts that the  murders were "cultural," and challenged mainstream feminists to  speak out against the racist framing of the murders.  The Coalition is demanding a full independent inquiry into the  actions of the Vernon RCMP who were aware Ghakal feared for her  and her family's safety. The Attorney General responded by appointing a  Coroner's inquest into the murders and the stalking and attempted murder  of another Vernon woman, Sharon Velisek. The RCMP is conducting its own  internal inquiry. (May 1996)  The Coroner's inquest concluded in October 1996 and produced 29 recommendation on improving police procedures, firearms regulations, and government  policies on spousal abuse. This November, the RCMP released the report on its internal  inquiry written by Josiah Wood, and announced changes in the way it handles cases of  violence against women in relationships.  The death of Studio D  Studio D, the only government funded feminist film and video producer/distributor in the world became the latest victim of the federal Liberal government's budget cuts. During its 20 year existence, Studio D  produced or co-produced 120 films. Its films have received more than 75  national and international awards, including a Genie and two Academy  awards.  The closure of Studio D also means the New Initiatives in Film program will be shut down. NIF is a professional development program dedicated to supporting the increased participation of Aboriginal women and  women of colour in Canada's cinema.(April 1996)  BCs bubble ^one law  upheld  ProT±oicz adiviste daimed victory last*  mont*h when rhe EC Supreme Court  upheld rhe province's Access to Abortion Services Act as consrirurion-  aily valid.

(November 1996)  Child Benefit Bogus,  not Bonus  Anti-poverty activists expressed their skepticism  at the latest proposal for ending child poverty put  forward by Canada's social services ministers. In  mid-January, the ministers met in Toronto to discuss  establishing a national child benefit program. Anti-  poverty activists say for such a program to make  any real dent in child poverty rates, more than $2  billion would have to be infused into it.  Despite having resolved in 1989 to eliminate child  poverty by the year 2000, Canada has seen the number  of children living in poverty grow steadily. The latest  proposal will likely leave many poor children even  worse off because it will come at the expense of other  critical social programs.

The writ argues that the equality rights of Aboriginal women are being  violated by provisions in the Indian Act, which deny women living on reserves access  to matrimonial properties upon the breakdown of their marriages.(April 1997)  I've got tlw deal for you! Deposit DNA with us,  we'll get you a high interest return and we'll throw in an extra bonus  by helping you get your man!! Waddya say?!  DNA databank a dud  Much to the surprise of the federal government, there is strong feminist opposition to its proposed DNA databank. After succeeding in passing its DNA  warrant legislation, the federal government is now planning to introduce a bill  that would earmark hundreds of millions of dollars to set up a DNA databank.  The databank would store DNA materials of people convicted of violent crimes.  Feminists' main critique of the increased focus on DNA evidence is that  there is no proof that it leads to higher conviction rates or that it deters men from  attacking women. A DNA databank would only truly be effective if violent crimes  were committed by convicted repeat offenders.

Although the CPP already has a $40 billion cushion,  the federal government says it wants to create a huge slush fund that could be invested to cover future pension costs.  While the government has known for many years that there would eventually  be a disproportionate number of seniors to people in the paid labour force, it has  done little to address the real cause of this situation: unemployment. By the way,  Canada spends less on public pensions as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product than many other countries in the world, including the UK, the US, Italy, France  and Germany. (July/August 1996)  Unionizing Starbucks  Workers at nine Starbucks in BC are waging an historic  fight to unionize the multi-national coffeeshop chain. Although it likes to portray itself as a progressive employer,  Starbucks' "partners," as employees are referred to, earn  much less than at comparable firms. A Canadian Starbucks  worker earns $7 an hour to start, while Starbucks CEO  Howard Schultz's annual salary was $493,654 in 1995.(July/  August   1997)  KitSlS  DECEMBER/JANUARY    1999 National Women's March  Against Poverty  June 15th: Thousands of women worked  their way through the streets of Ottawa between  Le Breton Flats and Parliament Hill chanting such  messages as: "Bullshit, get off it. The enemy is  profit." "Sol-sol-sol... solidarite." And "Hey hey,  ho ho, women's poverty has got to go."  The National Women's March Against Poverty had arrived in the nation's capital, and was  sending a clear message to the federal government and to the right-wing that women are strong,  powerful and united and "...will never be defeated."  Starting from St. John's, Newfoundland and  St. John, New Brunswick in the East and Vancouver and Burns Lake, BC in the West, the  March caravans had made their way through  more than 80 communities across Canada. More  than 50,000 women, children and men came out  to rallies, street actions, performances, educational workshops, tent cities, and more.

The  study concluded that Tomoxifen can  be used to prevent breast cancer  among "high risk" women.  Although the researchers involved  in the study have been quick to raise  women's hopes about having found a  cure for breast cancer, criticism has  been widespread. Chief among the  among the questions is why researchers called off the study two years  early. As well, Tamoxifen is known to  have negative side effects and has  even been linked to uterine cancer.

The  reason behind the murder, according to  newspaper accounts, was that she was  "an overweight teen" who didn'tftt in. The  focus of the public was on violence committed by girls, since most of those involved in the assault and murder of Virk  were young women.  But the question remains: How  could Reena Virk have "fit in?" She was  "brown" and "overweight" in a predominantly white society which values thinness to the point of anorexia. In the public presentation of her murder, Virk suffered yet another erasure. While her picture was plastered on daily papers, no  mention was made, save one, that  Reena Virk died because of racism.

Custody and access  hearings a farce  After only a few days of hearings in  Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal, it became clear that the voices of right-wing  men hold a lot of sway with many members of the Joint Senate/Commons  Committee on Child Custody and Access. So-called fathers' rights advocates have received much support for  their claim that the Divorce Act is biased  against men, particularly from Liberal  Senator Anne Cools and Liberal MP  Roger Gallaway, the co-chair of the  committee. Meanwhile, individual  women and women's organizations  have been constantly interrogated  about the truth of their stories and  statistics. (May 1998)  The anti-woman bias of the Committee continued to be evident through-  out the hearings and in the media. The  Committee is required to release its report by December 11.  Wear a red armband on Nov. 24  Pay equity: victory still on hold  July 29 was a day to celebrate for women working in the federal  public service. The Canadian Human Rights Commission Tribunal had  ruled in their favour in a pay equity complaint filed by the Public Service  Alliance of Canada on behalf of more than 190,000 current and former  federal government employees, most of whom are women. For some, the Tribunal's decison could mean  they are owed more than $30,000. Celebrations were short-lived as the federal government made it known  that it would likely appeal the ruling. (September 1998)  The federal government waited until the last moment possible before filing its appeal with the federal court of  Canada. The appeal has yet to te heard. December will mark the stan of the 15th year of PSAC's pay equity dispute.  Women take on APEC  The National Womens Day of Protest Against APEC (the Asia-  Pacific Economic Cooperation) was an incredible show of strength and  creativity of the women's movement. Every Thursday for almost two  months before the APEC Summit, the Lower Mainland Feminist Networking Group met to strategize and organize for the big day.  One of the biggest ideas coming out of the FNG was the production of  stickers that read: "W)men Oppose APEC, wear a red armband on Nov  24." Over a three week period, 15,000 of them were distributed around  \4ncouver. In fact, the stickers are so wildly popular that a third run (of  5,000) had to be ordered just a day after the second run had come back  from the printers.

"I am a  feminist because I feel endangered, psychically and physically, by this society and  because I believe that the women's movement is saying that we have come to an  edge in history when men—insofar as they are the embodiment of the patriarchal  idea—have become dangerous to children and other living things, themselves included." - Adrienne Rich (1979)  FEMINIST VALUES  "Feminism is the political theory and practice to free all women: women of colour,  working-class women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women, as weli  as white economically privileged heterosexual women. Anything less than this is  not feminism, but merely female self-aggrandizement." - Barbara Smith (1979)  THE BIBLICAL FOUNDATION OF PATRIARCHY  "According to the book of Genesis, God first created man. Women was not only  an afterthought, but an amenity. For close to 2,000 years, this holy scripture was  believed to justify her subordination and explain her inferiority; for even as a copy,  she was not a very good copy. She was not one of His best efforts." - Elaine Morgan (1972) We will make no effort whatsoever to refute biblical or any other explanations of male primacy, except to observe: "No one is more arrogant towards  women, more anxious or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility."  - Simone de Beauvoir (1948)  THE PATRIARCHAL FRONT CALLED MARRIAGE  "Marriage laws, the police, armies and navies are the mark of human incompetence." - Dora Russell (1927). We believe that marriage in patriarchal societies  is little more than a relationship in which women give and men get. "Marriage  is primarily an economic arrangement, an insurance pact [whose] returns are insignificantly small...a woman's premium is her husband [and] she pays for it with  her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life." - Emma Goldman (1911).  The accumulated losses women have suffered in marriage have not gone unnoticed: "Women and elephants never forget." - Dorothy Parker (1931)  SEX UNDER PATRIARCHY  "I'm sure it's no coincidence that so many people have bad sex. It goes along  with general disregard for human pleasures in favour of the logic of making profits." - Nancy Mann. We believe that lust is good and need not be associated with  shame, coercion, deceit and fear—the qualities which most distinguish it under  patriarchy. "I have an inalienable constitutional and natural right to love whom I  may, to love as long or as short a period as I can, to change that love every day  if I please." - Victoria Woodhull (1871). We will no longer tolerate myths about  female sexuality: "I used to be Snow White but I drifted." - Mae West (1967)  WHO REALLY LOVES THE FAMILY?  "Being a mother is a noble status, right? Right. So why does it change when  you put "unwed" or "welfare" in front of it?" - Flo Kennedy (1973). We believe  patriarchal societies are, by their very nature, incapable of loving, teaching and  caring—the real role of a family. In fact, the patriarchal family is a danger zone:  "Many women and girls directly experience female sexual slavery without going  out of their homes. For them, home replaces brothel: they are wives or daughters  who are the victims of husbands and fathers instead of pimps." - Kathleen Barry  ALL WORK AND NO PAY  "A woman's two cents worth is worth two cents in the music business." - Loretta  Lyn (1930). We believe patriarchal values are inextricably linked to female poverty:  "The sexual division of labour and society remains intact even with women in the  paid economy. Ideology adjusts to this by defining women as working mothers.  And the two jobs get done for less than the price of one." - Zillah Eisentstein  (1979). We are tired of working too much for too little, just because we are  women: "Very few jobs actually require a penis or a vagina. All other jobs should  be open to everyone." - Flo Kennedy (1974)  THE POWER OF ORGANIZING  We believe that earnest feminist organizing is our most powerful tool against patriarchy. Our many sisters before and around us have taught us the ways: "Feminism is a many-headed monster which cannot be destroyed by a single decapitation. We spread and grow in ways that are incomprehensible to a hierarchical  mentality." - Peggy Kornegger (1979). "A conservative estimate would be that  90 percent of politicians patronize public women. Imagine the wealth of information available for bringing "undercover" pressure to bear regarding passage of certain legislation concerning...politicalfreedoms." - Margo St. James (1972). Well,  that's one idea.  A PUBLIC STATEMENT  WE THEREFORE WITH ALL IRREVERENCE AND SERIOUS INTENTION,  IN OUR OWN NAMES, MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT: THAT BECAUSE  GLOBAL PATRIARCHY BRINGS DESTRUCTION AND MISERY TO ALL IN  THIS CITY AND THIS PLANET—ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN—  WE THEREFORE FORBID IT TO CONTINUE. SO CUT IT OUT, RIGHT NOW.  FEMINIST INSURRECTION  We believe these times give a clear signal for women to shed any inhibitions and  tell the truth of our lives. We therefore urge all feminists to observe every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday as days of unrest and agitation: "There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or  the mirror that receives it." - Edith Wharton. Women: be your own candle and  each other's mirror. "Progress affects few. Only revolution can affect many." -  Alice Walker (1979).  A Girl Whose Spirits Have Not Been Dampened By Inactivity, Or  Innocence Tainted By False Shame, Will Always Be A Romp  Mary Wollstonecraft  (1792)  The above declaration was initialed by feminists in response to the homophobic claptrap published in Vancouver's dailies on November 4,1989.

And Terminal City is the latest local  newspaper to publish these images. The  story is so cliche, it's practically boring.  What I find galling, though, is how both  Vicious Cycle and Terminal City represent  that hip, funky, alternative world which, in  the final analysis, is often just more of the  same ol' sexist nonsense. I find it irksome  that using women's bodies to sell products  and services is as prevalent today as it was,  say 25 years ago.  In its October 30-November 5 issue,  Terminal City published an ad for Vicious  Cycle Laundro and Leisurama (located at  2062 Commercial Drive). The ad depicts a  young woman, squatting in front of a dryer.  One of her breasts is exposed. Her skirt is  hiked up to her waist; she isn't wearing  underwear and she is masturbating (or  rather, she is doing what guys think women  do when we masturbate). The text reads,  "drop off service: in and out inna' snatch."  "Snatch," is a derogatory word to describe  a vagina. It's most often used in male created pornography and, while it is being  used more and more by women in an effort to reappropriate it, the word in this  context really reinforces the misogyny of  the image.  There is a lot that is problematic here.  What I'm most concerned about, though,  is that there are still advertisers who think  it's okay to use sexualized images of  women to sell their products or services.  What does a woman playing with herself  have to do with laundry? What happens  when a child picks up a copy of Terminal  City—which is free and can be found all  over Vancouver—and happens upon this  ad? What does the image say about how  women's bodies are used to buttress the  twin pillars of capitalism and consumption  in this society?  A lot of women I know were incensed  by the ad. A few of us phoned Terminal City  individually to ask why they accepted and  printed the ad. We each got similar responses, namely that the paper saw nothing inherently degrading or misogynist  about the ad. As far as the advertising people at the paper were concerened, they were  just printing what was sent to them. Apparently, Terminal City does not have a  policy on what ads they will run.  I also decided to phone Vicious Cycle  to ask the folks there what possessed them  to use this particular image to attract customers. I spoke to Rebecca Freeland  ("That's Freeland, as in free land," she emphasized to me), who, along with Eileen (no  last name given), own and run Vicious Cycle. Why did they use this image in the ad?  "Because we found it funny," Freeland told  me. "Funny?" I queried. "What did you  find funny about it?" She said they found  it hilarious because, "it's an ad for a  laundromat. It's tongue in cheek. Because  the ad is so serious and a laundromat is so  not serious. We knew people wouldn't find  it appropriate." "Ah," I pressed her, "so  the ad is really about shocking people and  you chose to use a degrading image of a  woman to do that."  The whole issue of shock advertising is interesting. According  to Corin Browne,  a Kinesis volunteer and a Communications student at Simon  Fraser University  the Vicious Cycle  ad fails even if we  judge it according  to shock advertising standards.  "What consumers  have been able to  stomach about  shock advertising  are ads that seek  to raise awareness  or challenge prevailing ideas about something. What is  challenging about this ad?" In fact, nothing is challenging about it at all. And, in  fact, sexist images are nothing new—they  have been used for years because, apparently, sex sells products.  Kinesis readers have spoken out against  sexist advertising for a long time. In 1974,  a group called the Media Action Group was  formed by "members of Vancouver Status  of Women who wanted to do something  about sexist advertising." The group focused attention on one ad in each issue of  Kinesis. Sample letters to the advertisers  k mm  SN0TOI  LICENSE?0'  LWJNDBGWT  2062 COMMERCIAL'  Jn  were included so readers could make their  opposition known.  We hope to bring the spirit of the Media Action Group back toKinesis in our new  section, called "Bad Ads." From time to  time, we will highlight a particularly offensive ad, publish it, and attach a sample letter so that, as readers, we can act on our  convictions. So, if you come across an example of advertising offensive to women,  please send it to us here at Kinesis.

My  talent or lack of it is not my responsibility  What is my responsibility is  to use what I have to the full.  Doris McCarthy (1910-)  Elizabeth Catlett, Sharecropper-1970  by Kelly Haydon  FEMALE GAZES: Seventy-five Women  Artists  by Elizabeth Martin and Vivian Meyer  Second Story Press, Toronto, Ontario,  1998  A few years ago, I went to the main  branch of the Vancouver Public Library in  search of books about women artists—and  not just Emily Carr (I had read lots on her).  I bypassed the line-up at the computer terminals and plunged into the stacks. My  next hour was spent on my quest.  After going through some 800 books, I  was dismayed to have found only eight on  women artists—four of which were anthologies. When I got home, I was further  dismayed to realize two of them were about  a male artist whose first name is usually  that of a woman's. Perusing through bookstores—including those specializing in  art—it would seem there have only ever  been three female artists: Emily Carr; Frida  Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe. Harumph!  Needless to say, I was ecstatic when I  found Female Gazes: Seventy-Five Women  Artists. This incredible book exceeded my  expectations and calmed the trepidations I  have when it comes to books on women  produced in a patriarchal society.  Where to begin?!  Elizabeth Martin and Vivian Meyer are  high school art teachers in Ontario. The  book was born out of their students' curiosity about the role women artists have  played over the years. In the introduction  to Female Gazes, the authors say they  wanted to "draw out for our students and  others beyond the art community examples  of the powerful art women have created,  whatever the obstacles, throughout western art history as well as in our own time.  Female Gazes explores the lives and works  of women artists from many walks of life  and from diverse backgrounds. It celebrates  the wide range of contributions women art  ists have made to illuminate the complexities of the world."  As for layout, this book is gorgeous.  Two full pages (9-1 /2" x 10-1 /2 ") are dedicated to each artist, with a large single high  quality colour reproduction on one of the  pages and information about the artist on  the other. What I particularly like about the  layout is its beautiful simplicity One large  well-reproduced image of art seems easier  to absorb than pages cluttered with various art images.  After spending days drooling over the  art, I began to read. I was delighted with  the text. For each artist, details about their  lives are given, as well as information on  their artmaking methods and processes. We  learn about the whole of these women's  lives as it pertains to their art. We are told  such things as where they grew up; where  they studied, if they did; how they supported themselves; their thoughts on art  and women, et cetera.  The breadth of these women's lives becomes apparent, contradicting the silly  myths we are told about women artists.  Although some of these artists were born  into money, many were not. As well, many  were self taught and went on to become famous artists able to support themselves on  their work. Others supported themselves  as artists' models. Many remained single;  others had female companions; and some  were married with children. Of the latter  group, many started their art careers after  their children had left home, dispelling the  myth that an artist must start young. What  emerges from the profiles in Female Gazes  is a picture of women artists which is wildly  diverse.  The book covers a range of western—  European, Canadian and American—artists (half of whom are Canadian). It begins  with Sofonisba Anguissola, born in 1532,  and ends with Midi Onodera, born in 1961.  Four hundred years of glorious female art!

Elizabeth Catlett (1919- )  Pitseolak, Woman Hiding from Spirit-1968  tures, but as we move to more contemporary artists, we see a wider variety of media, such as photographic, film, mixed-media and stills from performance work. The  artists are revealed to us in the context of  the times in which they were living, and  Martin and Meyer detail the contribution  each artist made to women.  For example, Artemisia Gentileschi  (born in 1593), who was so successful that  she had her own studio and a staff of artists, was the first to paint women as heroes  and agents of their own deeds. Their  strength emanates right off the canvas. In a  self portrait, Gentileschi's woman artist represents herself, not as gentlewoman or  muse, but as the act of painting itself.  Initially, when I perused the book, I  feared I would find the single "token Black  artist." I was pleasantly surprised. There are  profiles of a number of women of colour  and indigenous artists working in various  media, from the paintings of Lois Mailou  Jones, to the printmaking of her student  Elizabeth Catlett, to the performance work  of Anishinabe artist Rebecca Belmore.  In most of the works anthologized in Female Gazes, especially those created this century, the artists deal with issues arising from  their lives and the society they live in. Kathe  Kollwitz's images of poverty in Germany in  the 1930's are unforgettable. The paintings  of Black lesbian artist Grace Charmer often  reflects her "passionate belief in the creative  potential of women and of Black women in  particular." Midi Onodera, a lesbian, deals  with issues surrounding sexuality.  The other thing I love about this book  is what it doesn't do. I was ecstatic to notice  the lack of male referrants—you know, we  can't possibly talk about a woman without  mentioning all the men in her life. I recently  read a large tome on Frida Kahlo which had  more about her spouse Diego Rivera (also  an artist) than on Kahlo herself. I have a  Georgia O'Keeffe book that dedicates an entire chapter to her partner Alfred Stieglitz,  and the rest of the book is overpopulated  with references to him and lots of other male  artists. No thank you, please: "A woman  without a man is like a fish without a bicycle."  Not only does this book discuss these  women in their own creative right, but it  also includes the artists' female colleagues,  which is an aspect traditionally overlooked. One is left with a wondrous sense  of women artists' communities and that  not all of our artistic fore-sisters worked  in isolation. When the men in each women's lives are mentioned in Female Gazes,  it is to show the supportive or collegial role  they played, not as a seal of societal approval. The women's lives are described  realistically and wholly.  I was also delighted to find many artists I did not know. Too often, the same  ones get paraded out over and over again.  The only criticism of the book I have  is one inherent to anthologies. How do you  pick who/what gets included? (I, myself,  had enough difficulty deciding who to  mention, what to show in this review.)  That said, I think the authors did an amazing job presenting a wide spectrum of  women artists.  Then, there is the problem of only seeing one piece of work. For example, we are  presented with an image of Faith  Ringgold's quilt work, but we are deprived  of her soft sculpture figures and her performance work.  Although anthologies are great and  this one is my favorite, I wish for a book on  each of these artists so we can see the full  range of their work and not be forever faced  with tiny glimpses. Every one of these  women is incredibly talented and, at the  very least, deserves a book of her own.  Kelly Haydon (1962- ) is a painter living in  Vancouver. Nature and women inspire her;  noisy car washes cramp her creativity. She applauds Second Story Press for producing such  a beautiful book that is reasonably priced ($34)  and that she will treasure forever.

AaanethaDyck(1937..,  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1999  31 Arts  A film on the life and work of archeologist Marija Gimbutus:  Honouring women  Marija Gimbutas  by Tanis Phillips  Marija, a film on the life story of extraordinary archaeologist Dr. Marija  Gimbutas, is in progress. Created by Belili  Productions, a collaboration between author Starhawk and director Donna Read,  Marija will weave together interviews, archival footage, photographs, narration and  reenactments of key moments in Gimbutas'  remarkable life. [Read is best known as the  director of the award-winning Women and  Spirituality Trilogy: Goddess Remembered,  The Burning Times, and Full Circle. 7  Gimbutas is one of the most extraordinary women of our times, having developed profoundly influential theories on the  origin of western civilization. From her excavations of neolithic European settlements, Gimbutas found evidence of a  peaceable, woman-honouring culture with  gender equality, no slaves and few class  distinctions. Essentially, Gimbutas is regarded as having laid the groundwork for  all others exploring the goddess traditions  in the European regions.  Joan Marler's book, From the Realm of  the Ancestors: Essays in Honor of Marija  Gimbutas, is testimony to Gimbutas' wide  range of influence. The collection of essays  by major scholars in numerous fields  presents a broad sampling of essential ideas  inspired by the work of Gimbutas.  Gimbutas is also extensively cited in Riane  Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade.  Born in 1921 in Lithuania, Gimbutas  was influenced by the myths and symbols  in the rich culture of her country. Being at  the far reaches of the spread of Christianity—officially introduced in 1387, but not  becoming entrenched until the end of the  16th Century—helped Lithuania maintain  its pagan roots.  Gimbutas collected many of the songs,  stories and customs contemporary pagans  in Lithuania continue to draw on. Her commitment to preserving Lithuania's heritage  gave her countrypeople material that sustained them during the years of Soviet occupation and helped spawn the resistance  movement that eventually overthrew Soviet rule. She is revered as an important  cultural "hera" in Lithuania.  Gimbutas' work provides material that  can be used to counter oppressive structures globally. Her findings reveal viable  alternatives to hierarchical structures; she  provides a model of egalitarian society.  "In Old Europe the world of myth was  not polarized into female and male... Both  principles were manifest side-by-side. The  male divinity... appears to affirm and  strengthen the forces of the creative and  active female. Neither is subordinate to the  other; by complementing one another, their  power is doubled," wrote Gimbutas.  Joseph Campbell, in the introduction  to Gimbutas' book The Language of The Goddess, describes her work as a message "of  an actual age of harmony and peace in accord with creative energies of nature which  for a spell of some four thousand prehistoric years anteceded the five thousand of  what James Joyce has termed the "nightmare" (of contending tribal and national  interest) from which it is now certainly time  for this planet to wake."  From the precedence established by  Gimbutas, we can no longer excuse war  and destruction as inherent aspects of human progress. If we have lived in peace  before, then we can live peaceably again.  Her message brings new hope and new  faith in our human capacity to live in harmony with nature.  Despite her credibility and the profound beauty and hope in her vision,  Gimbutas' theories are controversial and  often disregarded by others in her field.  This rejection is mirrored in the difficulties  the producers are experiencing in getting  funding for the film. Donna Read says that  mainstream media are not interested in  funding a film project "directed by an old  woman about a deceased old woman."  [Gimbutas died in 1994. At the time of her  death, she was professor emeritus of European  Archeology at UCLA. She had written more  than 20 books including The Civilization of  the Goddess J  Dedicated to the importance of this  film, Read and Starhawk have been working on Marija at their own expense. Some  monies for the film are coming from private donations and community  fundraising. Cinematography is expected  to be completed next year and the film's  release is scheduled for the year 2000.  The film is imperative not only to honour Marija Gimbutas, but also to continue  the positive influence of her life's work.  Read believes that Gimbutas' work is a gift  to humanity—her rendering of Old Europe  offering a glimpse of Homer's Golden Age  and a vision for the future.  Support in the form of ideas, suggestions,  energy and financial contributions is welcome.  Donations should be made payable to RECLAIMING (the funding agent for the film)  and sent to Belili Productions, PO Box 410187,  San Francisco, CA, 94141-0187, USA.

Tanis Phillips is a mother of two sons and is  currently a student at the University of British Columbia in Women's Studies and Studio  Art.  Starhawk on:  Sacred roots and sacred values  by Tanis Phillips  Author, peace activist and ecofeminist  Starhawk recently gave a public talk in Vancouver entitled, "Sacred Roots and Sacred  Valuei." With gentle humour and quiet assurance, she outlined for the audience ot  200 an effective strategy to counter the  current environmental crisis. Starhawk believes we can become protectors and healers ot the forth through the observation  ot nature and through community-based action.  Observation is a key concept of  permaculture, a system of ecological design based on the functional patterns found  in nature. Researchers in permaculture are  developing earth-friendly systems for waste  management and the creation of sustainable communities, Starhawk says. In this  approach, nature is the teacher and learning begins with long, protracted observation of nature, being in nature.  Observation does not require a special  setting—we need only to look within our  own communities: at gardens, trees, the  weeds in empty lots. Starhawk says that  nature offers the needed answers for developing scientific technology to solve environmental problems and improved sociological structures.  In her talk, Starhawk detailed four  things she has learned from observing  coastal forests:  INTERCONNECTION: microscopic  fungi create an interconnecting network in  the forest floor. Trees nurture their young  through this system and take nutrients from  trees in the sun to those in the shade, even  between different species. Humans are also  part of the whole and can create systems  for nurturing and support.  DECAY IS EOOD: the forest feeds on  the nutrients of decomposing matter. Humans can "recycle" their mistakes, growing and learning from them.  DIVERSITY DEVELOPS RESILIENCE:  diversity of tree and plant life creates resilience to disease and supplies diverse nutrients to the soil. Cacti person brings something to the whole.  THE EDGE IS A CREATIVE PLACE:  deer live at the edge of the forest, using  it for cover and finding food in the  meadow. When the "edges" of differing  personal and cultural identities (individuals and communities) interface with one  another, new connections and knowledge  can develop. Starhawk talked about the  example of the connection between the  Latino community and the pagan community in San francisco in developing new  creative expression in the rituals of their  shared celebrations of Samhain and the Day  of the Dead.  She urged the audience to create community-based rituals and celebrations—to  let ritual and celebration rise out of where  we live and to make meaningful connections in our lives through ritual by bringing real things to it, such as the garden's  harvest of flowers. Ritual can be used to  mark stages of growth and loss, honour  death and the spiral of rebirth, and to  struggle against oppressive social and economic structures, and conditions that want  to limit life.  The tarth is sacred, and that must be  taken seriously. Starhawk challenged the  audience to look at the economic and political powers and to do the work necessary to peacefully change them. People  need to get involved in their communities  to protect and heal the forth in any way  possible. People can use their individual  connections and methods of expression to  develop solutions—question, speak out,  write, paint, dance, recycle, garden, el cetera. There are as many solutions as there  are people.  Before closing the evening with an  empowering spiral dance, Starhawk gave  the audience one plan of action that everyone can participate in: starting November 26, (coinciding with Buy Nothing Day!)  there is a weeklong campaign to boycott  the clothing store, The Gap. The fisher family, which owns The Gap, recently bought  200,000 acres in northern California and  is proceeding to use unethical logging practices, including cutting old-growth forest  and herbicides. Communities can effect  change by joining the boycott and spreading the word.  Starhawk is the author of The Spiral  Dance: A Rebirth of The Ancient Religion  of The Great Goddess and Dreaming The  Dark: fncounters With Power, Authority and  Mystery. She hat also written two novels.  The Fifth Sacred Thing one/Walking to Mercury. Her forthcoming book is Circle Round:  Raising Children in the Goddess Tradition,  which she is writing with Anne Hill and  Diane Baker.
