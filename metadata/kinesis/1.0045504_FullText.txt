Women Rally For Action showed us  that there is a great need for information to be compiled on every  single MLA.  We need solid background information for effective  lobbying, and we need a good monitoring system of an MLA's subsequent actions and words.  As a beginning, VSW has now set up  a file on each MLA.  Included are  copies of the Women Rally For Action  Lobby Report on him/her, a photograph (so at the next Rally we.can  recognize him/her), correspondence  to and from the MLA, press releases,  etc.  Everyone is encouraged to cc ne  in and use these files...and provide  us with additional information.  Secondly, although we have always  monitored Hansard on a day-to-day  basis, we have now made all that  information easily retrievable. A  complete chronological listing of  all speeches, debates and comments  in the spring Hansard that in any  way relate to women's issues, the  status of women, or just women, is  now available at the VSW office.  Amazingly, it came to eleven pages  and over 250 instances of MLA's  standing up to speak on something  to do with women; it is somewhat less  amazing to discover that the vast  majority of these statements, are,  however, not positive!.  All statements have also been cross-  listed by each MLA.  Every MLA's file  now contains a full "record" of all  the times he or she has spoken on a  matter relevant to the status of  women, during the last session of  the House.  It is rather enlightening to compare the commitments made  by an MLA on the day of the Rally  with what actually transpired for  the rest of the session.  Rosemary  Brown's record covers three pages  and 45 instances of raising women's  issues, including the presentation  of three private Member's Bills, and  UNSUITABLE  ROYAL BANK UNSUITABLE  We should feel sorry for W. Earle  McLaughlin, president of the Royal  Bank of Canada. He was forced to  announce to the Royal's board of  directors meeting in September that  despite a "cross-Canada search" it  had been impossible to find a suitable  woman to serve on its board of directors.  Is it possible that the other banks  have snapped them all up? The Bank  of Montreal, the Canadian Imperial  Bank of Commerce, and the Toronto-  Dominion all have women as directors  — a grand total of five women. The  Canadian Federation of University  Women submitted a lengthy list of  qualified women to the Royal Bank.  The list included a senior insurance  executive, an economist, and an investment counsellor with one of  Canada's largest firms.  But Mr. McLaughlin contends that few  women have the qualifications to  handle a large business like a chartered bank and "a simple housewife...  could make no contribution to the  running of a bank."  The truth is that Mr. McLaughlin does  not care about the qualifications of  the women presented to him. The following is quoted from a column by Allan  Fotheringham, Vancouver Sun, Sept.  14, 1976:  "The reason the big five chartered  banks choose their directors has  little to do with their competence.  The directors have practically no  influence on the day-to-day operation  of the professionals who run the  thanks. The reason these worthies are  chosen is to tie up clients through  interlocking directorships.  Interlocking directorships is the  story of Canadian business life. Dr.  John Porter in The Vertical Mosaic  showed 15 years ago how just 907 men  in Canada shared 81 per cent of the  directorships of the dominant corporations as well as 58 per cent of the  bank directorships and 58 per cent  of those of insurance companies.  Today, there are 300 board directors  in Canada who hold more than 3,000  directorships of corporations with  assets of $700 billion. That's why  the Royal really doesn't want women:  Because they don't have the right  corporate connections. It has nothing  to do with their brains, housewife  or not."  When one woman of our acquaintance  learned of Mr. McLaughlin's statements  she withdrew her account and cut her  Chargex card in half and returned it  to the Royal Bank. She finds the Royal  Bank, its president, and its board of  directors unsuitable.  J.L.  many major speeches.  Bill Bennett  spoke only 4 times on anything even  remotely relevant to the status of  women, and each time only in response  to criticisms on government policy.  Any of this material is available in  the VSW office for perusal. Also,  copies will be sent of the Comprehensive List, or any MLA's individual  "record" upon request.  (Cost is  xeroxing and postage.)  VSW intends to continue this system  of monitoring of Hansard with the next  session.  It will hopefully provide  us all with more effective ammunition  as we continue to lobby for legislative change.

Ms. Menzies will  resign her appointment to ACSW in  order to take up her new duties. Temporary office work is one of the  more depressing ways of earning a few  dollars but I have submitted myself  to the torture fairly freauently when  out of work, new in tox-m or unsure of  future directions.  I'd like to share  a recent experience in a downtown  office building here in Vancouver.  Employed through Office Overload, I  was given a three-day assignment with  a Trust Company in one of the posher  highrises.  The first day went as usual.  On arriving the second day, my  disbelieving eyes fell on a curious  piece of sculpture displayed in the  lobby.  It was of a stark naked young  woman, long haired, sitting demurely  behind a typewriter with dictaphone  equipment pegged into each ear.  She  had a bland, conventionally pretty  face, lowered eyelids and provocatively flared buttocks. The piece was in  metal and entitled "Downtown Goddess".  The sculptor's name was Edward Apt.  Now, I am a meek and mild creature to  be sure; very repressed and all that,  but by the time my elevator had  reached the reception area on the  fourteenth floor, I was shaking all  over with rage and my head felt as if  it was going to burst.  I tried  stirring up a little anger among some  of the other young women, including  the front desk receptionist.  I found  no anger, no indignation, nor one  single person who was prepared to take  a stand and protest.  It felt like  shouting "Fire" in a burning building  Ten thirty came round and down I  went, all geared up to confront Mr.  Apt and tell him how un-apt (inept?)  was his artistic vision.  Instead,  I found a rather uneasy looking  fellow who claimed to be Mr. Apt's  representative. He told me that  Edward Apt was from Nanaimo (I  think), that his sculptures were  usually "of the female form", that  he had been in an accident recently  and would not be doing any more  sculpting.  I told him I was delighted to hear the news since all  the women staff in the building  thought it was the most disgusting,  exploitive thing they had ever seen.  I went back up and tried to get on  * with my Vrork1 .  My head was still  thumping and I kept trying to decide what to do. Lunchtime came  around and lo and behold, the  offensive thing was gone; it had  been banished.  I breathed easier  the rest of the day and realized that  I'd had some invisible allies somewhere.  Sometime during the afternoon, one  of the young male executives came  up to me and said, "You.know, the  senior Vice-President happened to  hear you talking to the receptionist  and he's pretty displeased. There  was a very important client sitting  nearby who could hear every word you  were saying.'i. I looked at him  blankly and heard "myself saying,  "Well, I'm glad somebody heard.  terrible temporary office work  and no-one taking any notice.  I wrote out a notice saying, in effect  that this was no work of art but a  poisonous insult and went down to  stick it on the front, of the thing  with Scotch tape.  Unfortunately,  my notice was removed pretty quick  since one of the administrative  staff had overheard my plans to put  it there.  I next called the Administration Office of the building  (after all, this was nothing to do  with the company I was assigned to).  I was told that complaints were  already pouring in (thank God!)  and that various artists had been  given permission to display their work  in the lobby during Habitat but that  the works were not screened by anyone in advance.  The artist himself  usually appeared in the lobby at  about 10:30.  That thing downstairs just had to go.  And it really didn't have anything to  do xvith company business, did it?"  The smart, young executive shook his  head at me disapprovingly and walked  away.  The next few times I called Office  Overload, they hai mysteriously run  out of jobs - just couldn't find me  a thing. That's the one and only joy  of being a "temp" of course - you can  always find work elsewhere.  But what  if that had been my job; my only job  in a tight market? Would I have  stuck my neck out and my vocal cords?  Probably not - or at least I would  have taken my time, thought out a  careful strategy and been intelligent enough not to disturb the public  relations image of the front lobby  reception area!  Jan Shoobridge.  WOMEN  IN  RAPE  RAPE ASSISTER  A National Rape Assister has been  appointed by the national Review  Committee representing the Rape Crisis  Centres across Canada. Ms. Joan Elizabeth Vance will provide a link between  the 20 Rape Crisis Centres across  Canada,  She will establish a National  Clearing House, co-ordinate statistics  and publish a bi-monthly newspaper,  as well as concerning herself with  issues of law reform, funding, etc.  The position was made possible by a  grant from National Health and Welfare.  INEZ GARCIA will be undergoing a  second trial for self-defence against  rape, on October 4, 1976 in Monterey  County, CA.  She is accused of killing her rapist.  She still needs encouragement, assistance and money  to continue her struggle. All donations to the VIVA INEZ fund are tax  deductible.

Presumably to go with the Olympics,  the Telly has been showing a series  called Olympiad, focussing on  various facets of past Games. in  one program the Marathon was the  topic and I watched with fascination  as the last runner (staggerer?) hobbled to the finish line nearly Ik  hours after the winner. He was in  the last stages of exhaustion, both  mental and physical and it was  painful to watch him take a few  steps on his bandaged bloodstained  legs, rest, and then lurch on again.  The narrator with his voice quivering with emotion, informed me that  that's what the Olympic spirit is  all about, pride. A sort of international "a man's gotta do what a  man's gotta do" syndrome.  Women are not allowed to run in the  Olympic marathon although they seem  to do quite well in Boston, but I  wondered watching that poor man  (surrounded by TV cameras) dying on  his feet whether a woman would do  that - surely we have more sense.  I, at any rate, have more sense  since I am the complete non-athlete.  People who climb mountains because  they are there and whizz up and down  those mountains on bits of wood are  an utter mystery to me and long may  they remain so.  In my youth, I was  the despair of all games teachers  because through lack of interest and  inborn uncoordination, my one contribution to athletics was an overrated ability to run.  I was a very  skinny kid (o happy day), and didn't  have much to carry about, and my  teacher, who was very kind pounced  on this meagre talent as if it would  lead to my salvation.  Actually, it  nearly led to my demise since she,  optimistic soul, put me on the right  wing of the hockey team, grass hockey  that is.  It went quite well at first until  some idiot passed me the ball - what  to do.  "Run, Wright, run," shrieked  the teacher from the sidelines.  Wright, which happened to be my name  at the time, obediently took off down  the field, when over the horizon  loomed an enormous figure.  She was  huge, at least 10 feet tall with  shoulders like the defensive unit of  the Green Bay Packers and she was  armed.  Clutched in one massive fist  was a hockey stick but to my terrified eyes she looked like a cross  between Atilla the Hun and Hagar the  Horrible.  So I ran; right off the field, taking  care to take the ball with me and thus  stop the inevitable massacre. That,  thank God, was the end of my sporting  life, for as Miss Whatsername said,  "you don't seem to be cut out for it."  Not, you understand, that I am opposed  to sports of all kinds for women. On  the contrary, I admire the efforts of  sportswomen the world over, even if I  cannot hope to understand what drives  them. I just hope I never see a  woman tearing herself apart like that  marathon runner.  Anyone for Tiddly Winks?  Margaret Nicholls feminist ethics  1. What serves and advances the feminist movement, serves and advances mec  I will not allow myself, therefore,  to become either possessive or envious  of any position, program, or issue and  whether as leader or member, I will  remain open to the suggestions and  innovations of others, welcoming all  the help I can get, and offering all  the help I can give, knowing that  cooperation and collaboration—not  competition or authoritarianism—are  the feminist approach.  2. Where there are differences of  opinion, I shall use persuasion and  never resort to coercion, keeping in  mind always that I have not necessarily converted people because I  have successfully silenced them.  I  am aware that to be in the majority  is not necessarily to be right and  will listen to minority views with  attention and respect, seeking opportunities for reasonable compromise.  Further, I will consider and argue  issues on their merit, never in terms  of personalities.  3. Remembering that everyone has the  right to be well-thought of, unless  they themselves make it impossible  by their own words and actions, I  shall not encourage, listen to, or  make disparaging comments about a  sister.  If a sister's actions or  words puzzle or disturb me, I will  discuss this directly with her as  soon as possible, careful to present  my concern honestly and in a non-  accusatory manner and acting on the  assumption that she is "innocent"  until she proves herself to be  "guilty".  I will harbour no "hidden  agendas" nor attribute concealed  motives or goals to others.  4. I will honour, not envy, those  sisters who may be more effective or  skilled than I, and encourage, support and assist those who are less,  knowing I have a responsibility to  myself and to the movement to both  learn and teach.  I will treat with  special care and forebearance the  gravely wounded women among us who  have been so handicapped, so frustrated, so often humiliated and  oppressed by our sexist society, that  even among us, they are inclined to  be more negative than positive, un-  trusting9 and unwittingly more destructive than constructive.  5. I will respect every feminist's  right to choose a lifestyle that fulfills their individual needs and sexual orientation and will not subvert  or criticize their choice either  overtly or covertly, knowing there is  no single "right" way to live and  that "to hold close with open arms"  is the essence of love and sisterhood.  6. I know that to be genuinely feminist and committed to sisterhood, I  cannot harbour or practice racism,  ageism, or sexism, that sisterhood  permits no exclusions because of race  or ethnic origin, must encompass the  old as well as the young, and that  one can and must be sisterly to a  feminist brother.  7. Because I am aware that ours is a  movement composed almost exclusively  of people who are weary of being led,  subordinate, voiceless and powerless  and of conforming to rules and courses  of action we had no hand in devising,  whether as a member or leader, I will  never sacrifice principles of participatory democracy to the false idol of  organizational efficiency, knowing  that the uninformed, the ignored, the  unconsulted, and the excluded inevitably become pockets of dissent and  resistance.  I will seek to incorporate into the structure of feminist  organizations to which I belong provisions to insure that authority and  power flow from the membership to a  representative leadership, that the  decision-making process provides maximum opportunities for membership  participation and ratification and  respects the right of opposition and  the freedom to dissent.  Further, if  the leadership adulterates, distorts  or perverts the goals and democratic  processes of the organization, I recognize that the membership has a  responsibility to insist they cease  and desist, if necessary by a last  resort to tactics of civil disobedience,  8. I understand that the freedom to  dissent and the right of opposition  are to be exercised with integrity  and for sound and substantial reasons and it is my obligation to  develop and express these reasons on  the basis of perceived flaws in an  idea, not prejudices against the  person or persons presenting it. If  I fail to make my case in fair debate, I may remain a loyal opposition, but will not resort to subversion by word or act, knowing that  my obligation in such circumstances  is to be ready to rescue the wrong,  rather than rejoice at being right.  9. Tactics that men have devised to  "prove" their manhood, or establish  their superiority by confrontations  in which one must win and another  clearly lose, contradict the traditional values of womanhood and it  is these values I am committed to  examine in a constant effort to  develop non-adversarial techniques  and strategies both to achieve the  movement's goals in the outside  world as well as to govern our actions and resolve our differences  within the feminist community.  I  recognize that corrupt means employed  to achieve even the most exalted ends  may warp their realization by corrupting those who use them.  10. I will remember that what I  have done in the movement and at  whatever personal sacrifice, I did  for myself as well as my sisters and  the movement "owes" me nothing but  the same respect I give my sisters  for their work and their sacrifices.  I recognize that my participation has  given me opportunities for personal  growth and development I might never  have known had there been no movement.  My first and foremost obligation to myself as a feminist is  to achieve economic independence  and there is no prohibition against  any occupational success.  However,  while my participation in a feminist  action organization, particularly as  a leader, may provide some financial  rewards, I must be wary of becoming  dependent on the organization and  my position in it as a source of  support or as a platform for professional advancement, knowing I  may run the risk of confusing my  personal needs or ambitions with  the political necessities of our  cause and thereby precipitating a  suspicion of professional opportunism or conflict of interest.  At the same time I am aware that  the feminist movement has no goal  and sisterhood has no concept that  requires martyrdom or forbids  success.  /Proposed revisions and additions  to or commentaries on this draft  of a Feminist Ethic may be directed  to Toni Carabillo, 1126 Hi-Point  Stree_t, Los Angeles, California  90035/  small  changes  Jo Mitchell, Women's Employment  Coordinator at Manpower in Vancouver  advises that:  Can Cel has its first woman forest  technology graduate on staff.

"We know that serious, lasting change  does not come about overnight, or  simply, .or without enormous pain and  diligent examination and'tireless,  undramatic, everyday-a-bit-more-one-  step-at-a-time work. We know that  such change seems to move in cycles  (thesis, antithesis, and sythesis —  which itself in turn becomes a new  thesis...), and we also know that  those cycles are not merely going  around in circles. They are, rather,  an upward spiral, so that each time  we reevaluate a position or place we've  been before we do so from a new perspective. We are in process, continually evolving, and we will no longer  be made to feel inferior or ineffectual for knowing and being what we are  at any given moment."  - Robin Morgan, MS., Sept/75. -NORTHERN NOTES-  September 8  Prince George, B.C.  Dear Sisters:  from     diana  bissell  I have just returned from mid-contract  meetings in Ottawa with the other  'consultants" who were hired across  the country (8). We are all working  in non-urban areas and, except for  B.C., with basically "unorganized"  women - at least unorganized in  terms of feminist issues. The  women's movement in this province  is in a much more organized state  than anywhere else in the country,  and it appears that there have been  more attempts here to ensure that  the voice of the non-urban feminist  is heard. The voice of the movement  in B.Cc also speaks for a wider  range of women - it would appear that  more "classes" are involved.  Prior to the Ottawa meetings I spent  time in Vanderhoof, Fraser Lake and  Burns Lake and visited Mackenzie again.  Vanderhoof is 60 miles west of Prince  George and is a small, conservative,  religious farming community with one  mill nearby.  I met with Bobbie Ford  and Alison Campbell (both were on  the Omineca Lobby Team for Women  Rally For Action) and learned first  hand about the problems and joys of  being a homesteading rural feminist.  Although there is interest in core  women's issues (traditional women's  organizations helped, fund Alison's  travel to the Rally) there aren't  enough people prepared to put time  aside to work only on these issues  so both Bobbie and Alison work as  "independent" feminists - raising  the issues wherever they may be -  school, justice council, single  parent group. And when another  feminist appears on the scene they  talk her head off!  Fraser Lake is a mining community  that was built twelve years ago to  house the Endako mine workers. Emily  Pacholuk and Marguerite Clarkson  have been there 12 and 6 years  respectively and are the unofficial  "ombudswomen" for the town.  They xrork  out of the women's centre, answer  crisis calls, run evening programs,  etc. There are special problems for  people living in single industry  communities - and for xromen, as al-  xvays, there is low employment and  little daycare.  The Burns Lake Women's Awareness Group  put on two successful seminars (Women  and the Law, Women and Consumerism)  in the last year and participated  actively in the Rally also. Joyce  Hamilton and Donnie Patterson are now  in the process of putting together a  LIP proposal for a women's centre.  Their plans sound terrific - employment counselling, career choice xzork-  shops for young women, meeting ground  for native and non-native women,  financial counselling, self-help  groups, etc. As well, they plan to  research and explore ways for all  women's centres to become more independent (financially).  I hope these travelogues don't become  too boring for you all. There's no  way I can go into tremendous detail  about this job and what I/we hope to  accomplish/begin, but I think it's  imperative to at least let you all  know about some of the things that  are. happening up here - hence the  hasty travel notes. There is a small  amoujit of contract money available  to the "consultants" and projects to  use this money are"being "fleshed out"  &  OTTAWA REVISITED  While in Ottawa recently I had the  opportunity to meet with Julie  Laronger, Coordinator of Status of  Women, who reports directly to Marc  Lalonde - Minister Responsible for  the Status of Women.  This is  basically a new position created  out of the IWY Secretariat Office  that was headed by Martha Hynna last  year and reported to Privy Council  Office. The Coordinator's office  will produce four information bulletins per year to be sent to all  people who received the IWY newsletter, will review legislation and  government programs in terms of their  effect on women and as x^ell will maintain contact x^ith all the government  departmental committees trhat have  been directed to look at their department's policy in relation to  women.  Julie is a lawyer by profession and  has had twelve years of experience  in a number of government departments.  When questioned about how it felt to .  be Coordinator of the Status of  Women for all of Canada, she said she  was "excited about the possibility of  creating change for women".  She also  noted that most of the recommendations  of the Royal Commission Report had  been implemented or x^ere in the pro  cess of being implemented and that one  of the major problems remaining was  one of stereotyped attitudes tox^ards  women. Apparently legislation regarding housewives and the Canada Pension  Plan will be introduced shortly and  work is continuing on re-vamping the  Human Rights Bill, divorce reform  and income tax legislation.  Whenever your group or you as an individual send letters to your M.P.  or a Cabinet Minister, I would urge  ycu to send a carbon copy to Julie  also - and if your group has a nex^s-  letter why not add her name to your  mailing list? One of the problems  of working in a government office is  the degree of isolation from grassroots organizations and concepts, so  if you have something to say about  what is really happening to women in  Canada in 1976, be^sure to communicate  it to all of those people who have  the responsibility of instigating  legislative and policy changes - that  includes your M.P., Cabinet Minister  directly involved, Minister Responsible for Status of, Women, Julie  Laronger, Coordinator of Status of  Women, and the Advisory Council on  Status of Women.  (Julie can be  reached at 307 - 63 Sparks Street,  Ottawa, Ontario.)  (that's an Ottawa word folks - learned  it last week and have been dying to  try it out!) at present. The first  project to get going will be the  hiring of an organizer to work xvdth  lobby teams - hopefully developing a  structure that will allow for ongoing  dialogue by women xdLth all levels of  government. And watch this space for  further announcements of the Northern  Women's Task Force on Single Industry  Resource Towns.  September is shaping up to be busy -  trips to Terrace, Prince Rupert,  Kitimat and the Queen Charlotte Islands as well as several conferences  and speaking engagements. Just after  Thanksgiving I go up to Whitehorse  for a week - and will be catching the  mail bus to travel the 150 miles down  to Atlin as well.  I'll be staying  with Mary Dawn Rippell there - remember Mary Dawn standing on the legislature steps making her lobby report  with her son strapped to her back?  Even though this is being written in  early September it is already nippy  here at nights and on the way to work  this morning I noticed several trees  that had already turned to yellow.  Radio said there was supposed to be  frost in the Peace region last night  - something tells me I'd better get  the car winterized soon!  Love to all,  Diana.  bill C-20  Katie Cooke, former chairperson of  the Federal Advisory Council on the  Status of Women, has issued a warning  regarding a clause in the new Citizenship Bill, Bill C-20. Bill C-20 which  has gone to the Senate after third  reading in the House of Commons provides for the granting of Canadian  citizenship to children born outside  Canada before the bill takes effect  to Canadian mothers, irrespective of  the father's nationality.  However, there will be only a two  year period after the bill becomes  law in which applications for citizenship may be made for these children.  Ms. Cooke's concern is that this  clause will not be fully publicized  and many mothers may not be aware  of the retroactive provision and  that they have only two years to  apply if they now have children who  were not able to take their citizenship at time of birth.  WE'RE NEAT AND RELIABLE  Chris Waddell, Director of the Women's  Bureau, B.C. Department of Labour,  reports that a study by Energy, Mines  and Resources Canada says," women  seem to treat equipment better than  most male employees." The study also  notes that lateness and absenteeism  amongst female workers is less.  -WCWN BRAVE—HEARTED  WOMAN  "A nation is not conquered  Until the hearts of its women  Are on the ground.  Then it is done, no matter  How brave its warriors  Nor how strong its weapons."  (From the Cheyenne people)  ANNA MAE PICTOU AQUASH  Anna Mae Pictou Aquash was born on  the Micmac reserve of Shubenacadie  in Nova Scotia. On February 24, 1976  her body was found beside the highway  on the Pine Ridge in South Dakota.  The official verdict was death by exposure and FBI agents severed the  hands from the body and sent them to  Washington for identification. The  body was buried in an unmarked grave.  When the body was exhumed an autopsy  revealed an area on the neck "grossly  compatible with a gunshot entrance  wound...Removed from the brain is a  metallic pellet dark grey in color  grossly consistent with lead.

There  was unanimous agreement to accept a  proposal of a 50/50 split of pension  benefits at the time of legal separations or divorce. However, Ontario  did not give its approval to the proposal of a drop-out provision for the  I  spouse who leaves the labour force  to take care of children. As Ontario  has veto power in joint federal-provincial decisions, this proposal cannot  be acted upon.  ^CSW has learned from Health and Welfare Canada officials that legislation  is being drafted regarding the first  proposal. There will be no other  federal-provincial ministers' conferences on this subject.

DUTCH ABORTIONS  The only clinic in Holland that terminates pregnancy after 12 weeks,  though illegal, is tolerated pending  law reform.  However, two Roman  Catholic members of the centre-left  government coalition are determined  to shut it down, and the dispute  threatens to split the Dutch cabinet.  More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered at the clinic Bloemenhove after  bailiffs sealed the doors of the  operating theatres and wards.  The  women broke the seals and re-opened  the wards.  The governors of the  controversial clinic decided to keep  the clinic open and apply for a court  injunction to suspend the original  order closing it.  ARAB WOMEN'S BANK  A women's hank was opened this May  in Dubai, in the Union of Arab Emirates , by the British Bank of the  Middle East, the oldest banking establishment in the Gulf. The,bank M  was set up to serve women who are  unaccustomed to banking because it  involves mixing with strangers in  public places. The women's bank  has nothing to do with women's  rights.  Rather, it reflects the  strict enforcement of female segregation in Islamic Arabia.  ARCHITECTS AND A.A.  The American Institute -of Architects  has developed an affirmative action  plan initiated by their task force on  women in architecture.  The plan is  similar to those of educational institutions, business and government.  Discrimination in architectural offices has excluded women almost  entirely from heading up design teams  in the past. The pay of women professionals in the field has until now  been very much lower than that of  similarly educated and experienced  males.  FRENCH WOMEN'S CHARTER  In May this year, Mme.

SEXUAL HARRASSMENT ILLEGAL  A U.S. federal court has judged that  a male justice department supervisor  who retaliated against a female  employee who rejected his sexual  advances, was guilty of sex discrimination. This is possibly the first  time that the Civil Rights Act of  1964 and the 1972 Equal Employment  Opportunities Act has been invoked  successfully by an employee charging  sexual harrassment. Men may also  file charges.

Davis-Poynter (London, 1975)  Hardcover $10.00  167 pages  Reviewed by M. Moore  What is life like for most one-parent  families?  According to this book  life is exceedingly grim for both  parent and child.  Published to help  the work of Great Britain's National  Council for One Parent Families, itr  catalogues the difficulties experienced by this most exaggerated version of the nuclear family.  It  also gives a brief history of the  Council x-7hich was founded in 1918  and has provided services for one-  parent families while lobbying for  government action on their behalf.  The book is divided into three sections: the first consists chiefly of  experiential accounts written by  parents, and in some cases, by  people who grew up in a one-parent  family.  These deal with the frightening and painful adjustment to  separation, the problems experienced  by a visiting parent, the misconceptions and prejudices encountered  by all members of the one-parent  family, and many of the quite  ordinary and often difficult circumstances of single parent life.  Work is obviously not the solution  for the poverty which provides a  background for many of these difficulties.  Five out of six one-  parent families are headed by women  and in Britain the average hourly  earnings for women are 36% lower  than those of men.  Therefore it is  no surprise that only 25% of female  BOOK  REVIEW  single parents x^ork compared with  90% for males in a similar position.  The second section of the book summarizes the findings of the Report  of the Committee on One Parent  Families, a document which took 4%  years to prepare and was finally  published in 1974, constituting a  kind of Royal Commission Report.  It includes in its terms of reference a condemnation of inequality  based on gender membership and lists  recommendations x^hich have not been  acted upon by the British Government.  The final and most curious section  in the book deals with the topic of  illegitimacy. This includes an  article by Brigid Brophy which  develops the thesis that Jesus was  illegitimate.  It also contains an  entrancing modern folktale by  writer-poet-feminist Maureen Duffy  entitled "The Happy Bastard".  The book, however, is oddly unsatis- .  fying and unfocused. .Perhaps Barber  might have compensated for this in  the preface but unfortunately the  heavy tone of concern, characteristic  of the worst type of  libSral social  worker, simply reinforces the impression that one-parent families  are the modern equivalent of the  little matchgirl: guaranteed to evoke  the easy Walt Disney-rush of concern  and sorroxtf from the hearts of the  warm and chloresterol-fed middle  class but remaining essentially powerless and not quite real.  Even the  "*language used in the book betrays  this point of view in its use of the  term "complete family".  This definition of the one-parent  family as a crippled and inadequate  social unit is destructive, complacent and, from a social science point  of view, ridiculous.  Someone from a  society in which the extended family  is the dominant form may as well argue  that the two-parent nuclear family is  incomplete.  It is also a point of  view which allows many single parents  to recount miserable histories without  rage or any indication of passion.  Too rarely in the writings in this  book is there a suggestion that one-  parent families experience joy,  boredom, or love. And thus the book  tends to reinforce the stereotype  that is so damaging to the one-parent  group. Those of us who are single  parents, or who know single parents,  are possible most impressed by both  the strength and the ordinariness of  the one-parent family.  ONE-PARENT FAMILIES remains an extremely well-written book which is  best when it deals with the minutae  of one-parent family life.  (Reading  it I found myself admiring the ease  with which the British write expository prosei) Despite its serious and  numerous shortcomings it does acquaint  the reader with some of the problems  associated with being a member of a  one-parent family. And there are  moments of delight in the book, the  most notable being Duffy's story  which comments on the marriage question with intelligence and humour.  BOOK REVIEW  MOMMA: THE SOURCEBOOK FOR SINGLE  MOTHERS, by Karol Hope and Nancy  Young eds. (New York: New American  Library, 1976)  Reviex^ed by Jane Evans  Most of the articles here come from  Momma, a newspaper/magazine for single  mothers published by the organization  of the same name in California.  Started in 1972 by a group of'women  who wanted to share their experiences  with others, the organization has  spread all over the United States and  the magazine is firmly established.  The articles in the book are all  strongly subjective, full of anger  and some bitterness.  There is certainly reason for this; the single  mother everywhere has encountered the  same loneliness, guilt, lack of social  support (financial, emotional, and.  above all, practical) and fear of the  future. The overall effect of the  book is, however, disappointing. Many  of the writers stress their optimism  and hopes for a better life for themselves and their children, but we  remain unconvinced.  Perhaps it is  the effect of all the misery that has  gone before. Many of the heterosexual  women have turned away from men to  form relationships with women, and  no wonder; there is a faintly unpleasant section at the end of the  book in which the men involved with  single mothers discuss their reactions  to their lovers and the children in  the household.  There are suggestions  that the men enjoy the family situation but never lose sight of the fact  that they can split at any time. Two  single fathers discuss their lives;  one in particular has the same problems of any single mother, society  not just discriminating against the  woman in need but grossly undervaluing the whole child care aspect of  life.  This is an American book so the articles dealing with welfare, Court  orders, divorce and so on do not give  us the Canadian picture but they contain lots of useful tips on pitfalls  to avoid and there is an article on  something we should certainly try to  get for ourselves, an apprenticeship  scheme for women in skilled trades.  This is a book, it seems to me, for  the woman who has just struck out on  her own, when the wound-picking  syndrome is at its strongest; once  past that time, something more positive is needed.  BOOK  PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR THE UNMARRIED  COUPLE, by W. Blaine and J. .Bishop,  Sun River Press, 1976, $7.95, is  just that, a layperson's primer on  legal matters affecting common-law  couples.  It is,.however, unique in  that it is aimed not only at young  straights, but also at gays and  senior citizens living outside 'holy  wedlock'.  The book, while American^  will have general relevance to  Canadians.  It presents a simple  overview on a wide variety of legal  hassles unwed couples encounter, with  general non-judgmental, non-moralizing  advice on what to do.  The central advice of the bock is  that unwed couples should write out  little agreements about property, etc.  in order to prevent serious quarrels  should they separate later.  This is  distasteful, but seems the onlv rational way of protecting one's rights  and possessions when living together  unmarried. The contents page lists  among other things, chapters on:  finding a lawyer, small claims court,  buying and owning things like jewel-  !  ry, art, furniture, autos, insurance,  property, a home, as well as investing money, joint banking, credit,  alimony, child support, leasing and  renting, x<relfare, income taxes and  wills.  I recommend it as wise introduction for just about anybody xsTho is  living with their "old man".  K.R. BOOK REVIEW  9  THE FLIGHT OF THE MIND - The Letters  of Virginia Woolf 1882-1912  Editor: Nigel Nicolson  Ass. Editor: Joanne Trautmann  Published by Clarke Irwin and  Co. Ltd., Toronto 1976  Price: $17.50 (hard-cover)  Reviewed by Jan Lancaster  Virginia Woolf wrote many thousands  of letters during her lifetime and  some 3,800 of them survive in public  and private collections. People  kept them because they were fond of  her and because she wrote as she  talked, brilliantly. These letters  preserve her personality and the very  tone of her voice. They explain incidents in her life and how she felt  and reacted to them.  Nigel Nicholson together with Virginia  Woolf's nephextf and niece Quentin Bell  and Angelina Garnett, have commenced  a gigantic task - that of compiling  a six-volume collection of Virginia  Woolf's letters xvritten between 1888  and 1941. She was a profuse letter-  writer even if her spelling and  grammar were somewhat erratic. The  prospective reader will be relieved  to know that suitable and very careful amendments have been made by the  editor in this regard.  Her habit of  not properly dating her letters also  added problems to their tasks and  this book is the first volume of the  collection, and covers the period of  her childhood up to her marriage to  Leonard Woolf.  It was decided by  the editor to omit her replies, of  which she kept a considerable number  as they would have added intolerably  to the size of the already massive  correspondence.  Personally, I think this is a great  pity as many of the people she corresponded with were mighteous in their  own right, i.e. Lytton Strachley,  Vita Sackville-Westo Also, it makes  to a disjointed pattern, one difficult to follow and assess.  Not all periods of her life are covered by the letters. Unfortunately,  many letters were destroyed. For  example, there are no surviving  letters to her sister Vanessa prior  to her marriage to Clive Bell,, and  none to Bruce Richmond, Editor of the  Times Literary Supplement "during the  period when Virginia was beginning  her writing career. When she was  lonely, she wrote letters. They  were the drafting board from which  later emerged her novels. To Virginia, a true letter "should be a  film of xrax pressed close to the  graving in the mind".  There must be  laughter in it, and affection, a hint  of tragedy and the imperfections of  mankind.  When writing to members of her  family or intimate friends, she would  constantly refer to them by a variety  of personal nicknames or alternatively  sign herself "sparroy" or "goat".  Nicolson has compiled a glossary in  the back of the book, so the reader  need not be confused. He footnotes  locations and has added details to  assist the reader in understanding  where she was at the time of writing  or to which incidents she is referring.  There is no doubt that this book is  a work of art and much credit must  be given to Nigel Nicolson for performing such a complex task as this,  in such an ordered and delightful  fashion. The photographs included  in the volume add to a total picture  of Virginia Woolf, her life and her  companions.  For those who want to dive" into the  more intimate details of Virginia  Woolf's life, or are fascinated by  the life she led and the people she  shared her more intimate thoughts  with, then this book will certainly  satisfy them. To an English major'  x^ho wishes to specialize in her works,  then this book is a must for all  serious scholar's.  But unless you  enjoy reading a one-sided correspondence with its gaps and omissions,  I doubt one would find it satisfying  reading. Like many of Virginia  Woolf's novels, it's a complex book  demanding attention and concentration.  BOOK  EVONNE! ON THE MOVE by Evonne Goolagong  with Bud Collins  E.P. Dutton & Co., New York, 1975  190 pages, $10.75.  Reviewed by Heather Kellerhals  Even if you never look at the sports  section of the newspaper, the name  Goolagong is probably familiar. This  is her story, beginning as a youngster  in a back town in Australia where her  interest in tennis almost miraculously  developed, and culminating with her  victory at Wimbledon x^hen only nineteen over fellow countrywoman Margaret  Court.  If you are an avid tennis fan this  book will probably hold you spellbound,  if not, you may find yourself sneaking  a few pages hereand there as I admit  to doing. At one point, the author  herself wonders out loud whether the  book might have waited a few years.  Perhaps so. To me, many sections of  the book seemed little more than padding - discussion of women's fashion  in tennis for instance or Bud Collins'  long, long prologue over the state of  professionalism in tennis.  But when we turn back to Evonne Goolagong, the book comes alive again.  What  a pleasing personality emerges -  humour, a sympathetic understanding  of the foibles of human nature, and  a certain down-to-earthness that  does not disappear after the dizzying win at Wimbledon, the apex of  the tennis xvorld. To prolong the  suspense of this great match  against Margaret Court, the author  uses a clever technique. Flashbacks are interspersed with game  descriptions so what emerges is a  sort of mini-history set against all  the colour and excitement of Wimbledon.  Numerous black and white photographs  of the author provide a welcome break  in the centre of the book. As I  said before, if you are a tennis  "buff", you'll love the book.  BOOK REVIEW  WORDS AND WOMEN by Casey Miller and  Kate Swift  Published by Anchor Press/  Doubleday, New York 1976  Publication Date: June 4, 1976  Price: $8.95 (hard cover)  Reviewed by Jan Lancaster  Are you tired of reading books entitled "Man Around the World1,' watching T.V. programs billed as "Man's  Modern Achievements in Medicine".  Where are the women? Has the English  language always been sexist in its  nake-up or has it developed that way  over time, manipulated by men to  exclude us.  "Words and Women" compiled and edited  by Casey Miller and Kate Swift is an  excellent book in its analysis of  our native tongue.  They contrast such statements as "man  overboard" cried no matter what sex  of person has been swept away, but a  sign marked "men only" omits women.  How can we tolerate a word so commonly used in our language which in one  breath includes females and in another excludes. The insidious thing  is that women can be included in man  or not, at the whim of a writer,  reader, by judgement of a governing  body, its legal counsel or the Courts.  For children learning to cope with  our language, many difficulties and  conflicting concepts emerge - for  their sakes it is essential that  clarity of thought is expressed by  the correct use of all words.  One of the best features of this book,  to my mind, is that they not only  point out the ambiguities and faults  of the English Language but they give  examples, both serious and humorous,  and reasons why and how the language  can be amended to include everyone,  without necessarily making it cumbersome, ridiculous or unworkable. What  is happening now in language seems  simply to reflect the fact that  "women are seeking their own image  of themselves nurtured from within  rather than imposed upon from without".  Names - one of those things a little  girl grows up knowing she will be  expected to lose if she marries. They  have looked back in history (herstory?)  with facts to back up their statements,  and a precedent begins to emerge. Once  a name or a word becomes associated  with women it is rarely again considered suitable for men!  Words such as "herstory" are reality  violators and consciousness-raisers.  Language is the basis of our thought  and as our thought patterns are  steeped in sexism, racism, class  snobbery, chauvinism - this is.extended into our verbal usage too.  Sexist language is not deliberate -  it is either sub-conscious or lazy.  Eliminating sexism need not result in  graceless language. People mold  images - let us use words consciously  and knowledgeably for its OUR world  too. 10  Viva, August 1976 reports that the  risk of cervical cancer is three times  greater for a woman married to a man  whose previous wife had cervical cancer.  Studies show that high-risk  factors are associated with early age  of coitus, multiple sexual partners,  low socio-economic status, multiple  pregnancy at an early age, herpes  simplex virus type 2, sexual intercourse with uncircumcised men...oh  well, maybe we better just give up.  (KR)  Wives' Cervical Cancer  Chatelaine, August 1976 reports that  recent U.S. studies have shown that  cervical cancer risk is three times  higher for the second and subsequent  wives of men whose first wives had it.  Investigators aren't sure whether the  causative factor, which seems to be  transmitted by some males, is from  the penis itself or some type of virus  dormant in the sperm.  In addition, an  unusually high cervical cancer rate is  evident in wives whose husbands have  cancer of the penis. Cancer of the  cervix is apparently increasing among  married women and decreasing among  those never married.

Until the advent of the Pill liver tumors in  young women were extremely rare.  While still rare, their incidence is  increasing. Even benign liver tumors  can rupture and cause serious or  fatal hemorrhaging. Women who have  used the Pill for more than five years  and whose pills contain synthetic  estrogen, mestradonal, appear to be  at the greatest risk of developing  such tumors.  (New York Times,2/26/76. Reprinted  from Health Right, Women's Health  Forum, New York)  Sound Contraception: Chatelaine magazine advises that: "The University of  Missouri Medical Centre in Columbia  says that sperm production is inhibited for up to two years when men's  testicles are submitted to ultrasound.  Treatment apparently increases male  libido.  It is not known if the  treatment is reversible or if it must  be repeated."  MORE PAP SMEARS MAY PREVENT CANCER  Cervical cancer, a major woman killer,  generally could be controlled and prevented, through a national screening  program which concentrates on those  most prone to the disease, says a  study prepared for provincial deputy  health ministers. The study, done by  Dr. R.J. Walton of Winnipeg, and Dr.  G.H. Anderson of Halifax, states that  women over the age of 18, who have had  sexual intercourse should have two pap  smears a year until age 35. After that,  fewer tests are necessary. "Women who  have been sexually active since their  teens, especially those with multiple  partners are a high risk group," the  study states. The doctors claim that  such a program would be more effective and less costly than present methods of detecting cervical cancer.  (Reprinted from Kelowna Status of  Women Newsletter, June 1976)  Pregnancy Tests False: The federal  department of health Ifas informed  physicians, pharmacists, hospitals  and laboratories of possible errors  in pregnancy tests, due to interference of urinary protein, caused by  a condition known as "proteinuria".  Studies by the department showed  tliat some results of pregnancy tests  on non-pregnant women with the condition were found positive. Manufacturers have been asked to label  pregnancy test kits to indicate the  exact extent of protein interference  to be expected. .Kits affected are  Brevindex, Pregna-Chek, Prepuerin,  Pregnosticon, Dri-Dot, Prepurex,  UCG Tube Test, UCG Slide Test, Denco  Pregn Test, Confidelle, Pregnosticon  All-in, Pregnosis.  DIAPHRAGM LESS RISKY TO HEALTH  Despite a recent Planned Parenthood  (U.S.) survey which showed that in  1975, 81% of the women who came to  them "chose" the Pill, contraceptive  counsellors, gynecologists and statisticians actoss the country report  that the Pill's popularity is leveling off. College-educated women in  their twenties and thirties especialiv  are using the Diaphragm which is  least risky to the user's health.  According to Ortho Pharmaceutical  reports, sales of the diaphragm are  rising steadily among all segments of  the population.

All criteria for the definition  of obscenity "What is prurient according to contemporary community standards  have been determined by males. 3. How  do females define 'obscenity' or 'prurience'? 4. Issues which are significant  for females of elementary and secondary  school age to consider, in schools  and libraries, are going to arouse  censorship by parents and school boards  i.e. sexual mores, contraception,  venereal disease, family planning,  pregnancy, rape, abortion, single  parenthood, etc.  What other issues need to be considered?

UBC SALARIES ADJUSTED  Recommendations of the President's  Ad Hoc Committee on Salary Differentials for Faculty Men and Women were  approved Tuesday by the UBC Board of  Governors. The committee of three men  and three women found 29 inequities  in salries among the 281 full-time  xromen members of the UBC faculty.  Women who wished to have their salaries considered were asked to name  male peers and this "matched-pair"  system was used by the committee as  part of its deliberations. The 29  women will receive salary increases  retroactive to July 1,1975, to give  them parity with their male counterparts.  A Canadian female honors graduate  with a university Bachelor of Arts  degree can expect to earn on the average almost as much as a male employee with a grade eight education."  -Hon.George Proud,  Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women, to the P.E.I.Legislature  Assembly, March 1976. 11  EDUCATION  nadine alien & jo lazenby  One September afternoon four women who  have been deeply involved in working  towards non-sexist education in British  Columbia sat down with a tape recorder  and discussed their work. The conversation between Nora Grove (outgoing  B.C. Teachers' Federation Executive  Assistant,,Status of Women Program),  Gale Neuberger (Chairperson of the  BCTF Task Force on Status of Women  in Education), Heather Knapp (member  of the Task Force) and Nadine Allen  (Vancouver Status of Women Education  Person and Chairperson of the Provincial Advisory Committee on Sex Discrimination in the Public Schools  that was disbanded by Education Minister Pat McGeer) ranged over a variety  of topics — from the formation of  the first BCTF Status of Women Task  Force to a discussion of the personal  costs of "no holds barred" involvement  in the women's movement,  Following are some bits and pieces of  that afternoon along with some explanatory information.  THE BCTF TASK FORCE AND PROGRAM ON  THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN EDUCATION  Discussion on a Status of Women Program within the B.C. Teachers' Federation began in 1970 with the release  of the Royal Commission Report on the  Status of Women in Canada. The Executive Committee of the BCTF decided to  .examine the implications of that report  for the B.C. educational system and  in 1971 a Task Force was set up and  directed to investigate the involvement  of females in education in British  Columbia and recommend changes.  The recommendations that this Task  Force presented to the Executive  Committee dealt entirely with female  teachers (there were no recommendations concerning students) and the main  focus was on getting women into administrative positions. The Chairperson  of the Task Force, Linda Shuto, was  so upset with this focus and with the  limitations of the recommendations  heather knapp  that she brought forward a minority  report to the Executive Committee and  as a result the recommendations were  not adopted and the Task Force was  disbanded.  In 1972 a second Task Force was set  up and at the end of a year's work  brought 46 recommendations for change  to the Executive Committee and these  recommendations were presented to the  1973 BCTF Annual General Meeting.  These recommendations dealt with the  whole scope of female involvement in  the education system and included discriminatory clauses in teaching contracts (pensions, maternity leave,  group life insurance, etc.), administrative appointments, distribution  of teachers in schools, the social  and sex stereotyping of female students,  changes in curriculum and text books.  (For a copy of the Report of the Task  Force on the Status of Women in the  Government of the Federation and in  Education in B.Co, January 13, 1973,  write to B.C. Teachers' Federation,  105 - 2235 Burrard Street, Vancouver.)  These recommendations were adopted and  formed the basis of the BCTF Status  of Women Program,  In their Report the Task Force placed  top priority on Recommendation #1:  "that a BCTF member be appointed biennially to work full-time towards an  improvement of the status of women in  the government: of the Federation and  in education in B0C0 Such a person to  be fully committed to resolving all  areas of concern. This appointment to  be effective September 1973."  Linda Shuto who had been a member of  both Task Forces was appointed Executive Assistant, Status of Women Program  and since that time the Executive  Assistant and the Task Force have  worked closely together.  During its first two years the Status  of Women Program focussed on discrimination in four specific areas: text  books, curricula, teachers' attitudes,  and the structure and philosophy of  the schools, and concentrated on raising the awareness of people concerning  sex discrimination within the school  system, and in developing a network  of contacts and local committees in  each school district.in the province.  Linda was succeeded in August 1975 by  Nora Grove. Recently, after her own  resignation, Nora assessed the progress  of the Status of Women in Education  Program: "There has certainly been  progress in terms of awareness-raising.  You can walk into practically any  school in the province and find someone there who has some degree of awareness about sex-role stereotyping. And  practically everywhere you can find  committees working with the Status of  Women contacts* and people who are  willing to work on the Program to  eliminate sexism from the school  system. This is a very positive movement within the education system!"  So the program has been accepted and  has succeeded in making sexism in  schools a "legitimate" area of concern.  But what about the current feeling  that we hear expressed — that the  Program is in a slump...the energies  are down...the thrust is gone...etc.?  nora grove  where  are we  now?  During their afternoon conversation  Nora, Gale, Heather and Nadine discussed the stages the Status of Women  Program has been going through. They  agreed that the initial awareness-  raising stage was an exciting one as  people realized the ways in which the  various aspects of the education system  perpetuated and enforced sexrole stereotyping in our society, shared and discussed this new knowledge, and decided  to join with others to eradicate sexism in education. The awareness-raising  stage was a time of excitment and  discovery and now the Program has  reached a plateau — the awareness is  there and the focus has turned to  politicalization of women within the  Federation and the community. This  new stage has less of the exhilaration  — "Eureka! I see the whole pattern  now! Do you see it too?" — and more  of a dogged determination to work at  what often seems a snail's pace towards  bringing about concrete and lasting 12  changes in the entire system. For many  women this has resulted in a feeling  of anti-climax. But it is a time when  we should examine closely the reactions  to this new stage of progress.  Gale Neuberger: "When we were an awareness-raising group we weren't seen as  a threat by anyone. But now we've become a threat to some people because  of the involvement of women and the  politicization  of women within the  Federation. So the flak that is coming  now is coming from people who really  don't want to change anything. They  were prepared to look at token women  getting into administration but they  are not prepared to look at the underlying problems of sexism and deal with  the women who have become active within  the Federation through the feminist  movement in the Federation."  WHERE  DO WE  GO  FROM  HERE?  An example of the politicization  of  women within the Federation was demonstrated at the last Annual General  Meeting of the BCTF when members of  the Status of Women Program analyzed  recommendations coming forward to the  delegates and related those recommendations to the implications that they  held for the Status of Women Program.  During meetings with the Statusof  Women contacts who were delegates at  the meeting, these recommendations  and their implications were discussed  and the delegates were also urged to  speak to the candidates standing for  election to the BCTF Executive and  ask them specific questions about  the recommendations and about their  support of the Status of Women Program.  The women also indicated the candidates  that they had found to be supportive  in the past. These actions were seen  by some BCTF members as beyond the  legitimate business of the Task Force.  Gale acknowledges that "we are now  receiving a lot of reactionary comments  and feelings from individuals within  the Federation who see that kind of  action as inappropriate — so what  we're fighting right now is the right  to be political within the context of  the Status of Women Program and our  right to discuss openly issues and  candidates and bring about an awareness  of where the support is and to bring  about a hotter understanding of issues  in relation to the Program. All of  these things politicize people and  people who are afraid of the status  of women changing are reacting."  Nora emphasized the seriousness of  the position the Status of Women Program is now in: "We are at a very  crucial point in the that the Program  is being strongly challenged within  the Federation and there is a real  danger that a lot of groundwork that  has been done could go by the boards  — could be lost in a treactionary  movement against the kind of work we  are doing now — in terms of politicizing people, raising awareness with  respect to the whole system."  During a lengthy discussion three main  areas of concern regarding the reactions to the Status of Women emerged:  1) reaction from people who are afraid  of changing the power structure within  the education system. People at the  top have a vested interest in seeing  that the present hierarchical system  is maintained. People at the top are  men and "sexism" is threatening to  them.  2) a move towards including Status  of Women concerns in a broader context of Human Rights. This reaction  is coming from people who are bascially  humanist but who don't see the issue  of feminism as crucial. They tend to  see all areas of human rights and discrimination as being lumped together  and make suggestions such as " we  must broaden our perspectives and look  at other areas and groups" ..."we've  concentrated on this area for three  years and it's time to broaden out."  This approach takes the strength of  the Status of Women Program and waters  it doxm. It is a classic tendency and  can be seen in the history of many  political groups that lost their  impetus.  None of the women argued with the  opinion that support could not be  expected from within the Department  of Education. The fate' of both the  Provincial Advisory Committee on Sex  Discrimination in Public Schools and  the position of Provincial Advisor to  the Minister of Education as well as  recent conversations with Deputy Minister Walter Hardwick strengthen this  opinion. Can this be remedied?  Gale Neuberger: "Our energies are best  spent elsewhere at this time. Focussing on the government's refusal to  deal with the issue of sexism was  important in raising the consciousness  of people. But you can only spend so  much time in trying to influence gov- "  ernment. What are you really doing  xrtien you're devoting your energy to  trying to influence government without  building the base support? Women's  Rally for Action was important in  bringing about an awareness in women  that most people in government don't  give a damn about this issue and so  those women are going back to their  own areas and building their support  groups to put the pressure on government. And those kinds of groups are  really important!-That's where the  work has to be done — at the grassroots."  3) reaction from "liberal thinking  Queen Bees" who see the aim of the  Status of Women Program as getting  women into administrative positions.  There are a large number of people  who base their support of the Program  on that aim and the Task Force feels  that efforts must be made to assure  that this does not become the major  focus of the Program because,as they  point out, getting token women into  administration will not change the  situation for women or for students  within the system. The majority of  women within the system are classroom  teachers and that is what they want  to be — they do not want someone  telling them how to become administrators. What they do want is some  control over their working conditions,  some say in the work they are doing  every day. This is where the Task  Force feels the focus should be — on  the distribution of males and females  within the system and the power relationships within that system. The  Task Force has adopted the Provincial  Advisory Committee's proposal on Equal  Employment Opportunities and developed  an awareness-raising project called  "Equalizing Working and Learning" that  can be used by local teachers' associations to develop a program in conjunction with their school board whereby the school board would develop  policies with regard to equalizing  working and learning opportunities.  The program would open up opportunities  for teachers to experience more variety and flexibility in their working  conditions and would also deal with  opportunities for students by developing a process at the local level to  ensure that no student is denied an  opportunity either through a conscious  streaming of students or through subtle  kinds of persuasion that convince  themselves. Instead of the base of  the group broadening so that the work  is spread out, the members of the  group find themselves working insane  hours ("I'll stay here until its done  even though I haven't seen family or  friends for the last six weeks"),  assuming the total responsibility for  success ("it's all up to us — we're  the only ones who really know how to  go about it"), building resentment  ("nobody out there cares how we are  saving the world for them while they  sit back and refuse to get involved").  The result: exhausted, burned-out  women. And the women "out there"?  For all our feelings of sisterhood  we are not taking the time and care  to build and nurture the base of the  women's movement. By a handful of  women assuming the role of overworked  martyrs we are creating the myth of  the "super-feminist" — that small  group, those few "special women"  become the models, the in-group and  other women hesitate to become involved  ("look at how much they know and everything they've done — how can I speak  at the same meeting, work on the same  committee, write for the same publication, dare to disagree on some-  thingo.c")  Gale pointed out that "we are just  learning how to deal with the positions that our commitment to the Women's  Movement leads us to. When we get  past the awareness-raising, stage and  into decision-making positions it is  especially important that we take time  for ourselves and for each other —  that is part of being a feminist,  always keeping in touch with our own  and other people's needs and recognizing them on an individual level.  Not just becoming locked into 'the  larger thing'. We've all seen men  who deny themselves the knowledge of  being in touch with their feelings.  Our process must be different."  Everyone agreed that it is essential  to develop an analysis of exactly  how women are oppressed in our society  and maintain a perspective on the  goals we are working towards" One  of the reasons that women become depressed or 'burn-out' is that when  they get to a certain level they  suddenly see the magnitude of the  problem,, This can be a very difficult  realization to deal with — that you  can't just throw yourself body and  soul into the work for 2 or 3 years  and everything will be solved.  "Long term changes take time", says  Heather, "it's easy to lose sight of  the crucial issues and perspectives  and priorities when you're having  to deal with the present system.  To  work in this structure we must guarantee that there is a grass roots  basis and that our work remains democratic — we must not sacrifice to  efficiency and expediency. We must  13  EDUCATION  refer back to the basis time after  time after time.* This is slower  but we can't allow the end to justify  the means if we expect to make long  term changes".  Nora agreed:  "In order to make  changes we must get power but this  involves certain processes and we  are constantly faced with 'how much  compromise?"how much to play the  game?'.  If we're not careful the  goals recede and we become more like  the people and forces we started out  to oppose. This is a real dilemma  and the actual work involved is  deadening — the meetings, the  notes, the briefs, the time and  energy consumed in writing up proposals and reports, justifying our  needs, satisfying the bureaucracy.  Our process of coping with this  must be different. We must keep  our perspective and keep our goals  in mind, and we must keep in touch  with our personal needs and be  supportive of each other. The  women who find themselves in  decision-making positions, who become involved politically have a  heavy responsibility placed on  them and other women must be aware  of this and provide a support  group so these women aren't out  there on their own0  We must work  collectively — if we don't our  energies die. This must be considered one of the parts of the  development of our process."  we must work collectively —  if we don't, our energies die  students that there are certain courses  that are inappropriate because they  happen to be a certain sex.  A further advantage of this program  would be that it would also provide  a vechile to bring trustees, teachers,  parents, students, and community groups  together to start analyzing the education system — what is its real structure, where are different people placed  in this structure,etc. — and make  decisions together on how things could  be made more equitable. Involvement  of this type at the local level would  be a totally new way for decision-,  making within the education system  and the "grassroots groups" that are  growing up in the various areas around  B.C. will play a vital role. It is  important that these groups work together with the teachers in their  areas and that they learn the access  to the decision-making process and  how to influence that process. These  are necessary skills and those women  who possess the skills should share  them with others so that the base of  the movement is always being broadened"  BROADENING THE BASE AND SHARING THE  BURDEN  ACTION GROUP  Nora, Nadine, Gail and Heather discussed some of the situations and  problems workers in the women's movement are faced with.  One of the problems is the sharing  of leadership and organizational skills  and knowledge. An all-too-common  phenomenon in the Women's Movement  is a small energetic group initiating  action and taking the full burden of  carrying through the action onto  Fifteen women attended the first  meeting of the Education Action  Group, Sept. 15th, at the VSW Office.  Present as resource people were  Nadine Allen, Heather Knapp and  Nora Groveo The majority of the  women at the meeting xrere teachers  and the group hopes that more parents and students will become involved.  The group agreed that their most immediate priority was the implementation of the Women's Studies Course  in the high schools. The discussion  was divided into txro parts: the  rationale for introducing the course  and the political vechiles for  achieving this.  1) Rationale for introducing the  Women's Studies Course in  High Schools.  It is a common belief — shared by  teachers and parents — that curriculum in the schools is objective  and that the schools and the education system do not impose values  or biases on students. This is NOT  TRUE. Most of the courses in our  schools are 'Men's Studies' courses.  They do not represent the interests  of all people in our society —  they deal with how men run our  society and the role models they  use are xtfhite, middle-class males  who have 'made it'. Yet many of  these courses are called "the Humanities" and this very label makes  objection to them difficult, although they are dealing with the  point of view and accomplishments  of only one half of society. There  are no social histories of women  taught and students do not understand the socialization of women  in our society.  There are studies of texts and curricula that document in great detail  how the literature courses, the  Social Studies courses, etc. use  men as role models and women are  either ignored or stereotyped, degraded and humiliated. There is  no need for further documentation  — it has been done and done exhaustively and well. We know what  is wrong!  It is time for changes  to be made and the Women's Studies  Course is one way to work on these  changes.  Public funds are used for 'equality of educ&tion' but the schools  are only offering" the study of men-  Women's Studies courses are needed  to correct the balance.  2) GETTING THE WOMEN'S STUDIES  COURSE INTO THE SCHOOLS  A) Present Status of Women's  Studies Course:  The course is being printed by the  Department of Education and "should  be out soon". The annotated bibliography that accompanies the  Course is being done by UBC Extension: Women's Resource Centre and  will be printed (not by the Department) and issued separately.  The Department of Education has endorsed the Women's Studies Course  but it must be implemented at the  local level. That means that for  the Course to be in a certain  school the School Board of that  district must approve its inclusion  in the curriculum.  The B. C.  School Trustees Association has endorsed the course and has asked  that it be distributed to them until  submitted to the local level»  The B. C. Teachers' Federation has  stated on record and in policy that  it will support the implementation  of the Women's Studies Course0 14   education  and now:  STRATEGY  B) The Strategy:  This diagram may look like a pinball  machine or one of those maze puzzles  — part of the mysticism of hierarchical structures — but it is  possible to find a path through it.  In every school district there is  a B.C. Teachers' Federation Status  of Women Program contact with a  Status of Women Committee. This  committee has the obligation of  taking the Women's Studies Course  to the Professional Development  Committee within that local BCTF  who then takes it to the local President and Executive. Are you still  with me? OK#so far in the maze the  Program is still being passed  through the various parts of the  BoC. Teachers' Federation. At this  point the President and the Executive of the local BCTF Teachers'  Association has the responsibility  of taking the Course to the community^ and members of the.community and  the Status of Women Committee and  the local President and Executive  now take the Course to the local  School Board. And the local School  Board may refer the whole thing to  a joint committee of School Board  and community. WHEW!  Guess who  thought up this system.  Anyway — the important things to  know are:  1) Who is the President of your  school district's local Teachers'  Association.  2) Name of the Chairperson of your  local School Board (it will be a  School Trustee).  3) How courses are implemented at  the local level - Ask BOTH of the  above people.  4) Be familiar with the Public  Schools Act (available from the  Oueens Printer in Victoria).  Section 168 of this Act gives  School Districts the authority to  implement courses at the local  level (of course some School Boards  don't particularly want to take  this responsibility). The Department of Education has endorsed the  Women's Studies Course for implementation at the local level — the  individual School Boards can accept  or reject it for inclusion in  schools in their district.  It is  up to people in the community and  the schools in each district to see  that their School Board makes the  Course available in the local  schoolso  It would be naive to expect any further assistance from  the Department of Education.  It is  more likely that the Department endorsed the Course because it was  politically expedient — of all the  things that women were demanding  this was the easiest to deliver —  rather than because of any deep  commitment to seeing it offered in  every high school in the Province.  However that is our committment  and it is almost certain that every  School Board will ask for proof of  community support of the Course before they approve it.  So --  5) Call your local school' and see  if there is a consultative group.  6) Get community support organized.  community  support  groups  1) Write letters to Drc Walter  Hardwick, Deputy Minister of Education, Parliament Buildings, Victoria  and ask that the printing of the  Women's Studies Course b'e hurried  up.  It has been promised since last  March. Ask for copies of the Course.  Send copies of your letter to the  School Board, the Status of Women  contact in your area, your local  School Board, your local Women's  Centre, and your MLA. Note all  these copies on the bottom of your  letter to Deputy Minister Hadwick  (eg. cc MLA Rosemary Brown, Vancouver Status of Women,- Vancouver  School Board, etc.)  2)Become familiar with the Course  (start now by sending for the outline — available from the B. C.  Teachers' Federation, 105 - 2235  Burrard Street, Vancouver). When  your copy of the whole course  arrives study it thoroughly.  It is  an open-ended course, set up so that  it can be used in a variety of ways:  as a whole Social Studies course,  as a mini-course, as one semester  of a course, or by taking various  sections and using them to supplement the existing curriculum in  English, Social Studies, Law, Guidance, etc. (In some school districts  this last approach may be more  palatable). The course should be  treated as a Credit Course however  — otherwise the impression is given  to the students that the material is  not very important.  3) Know your opposition. There are  people who are opposed to changes  in the social structure of our  society. Many of these people are  organized into groups such as the  Value Association.  In a written  statement to Education Minister Pat  McGeer, the Value School Association  expressed the concern that "Some who  are influential in education have in  the past used the Department of Education to promote teaching materials and programs which are evidently designed to promote social change  of a controversial nature contrary •  to what has been the traditional  consensus of our society.  Others  have seen the opportunity to promote  such programs at the local level.  We believe that the public schools  should not be used to actively promote such change."  and ".o.the B.Co Teachers* Federation, which developed from  teachers exercising their legitimate  rights of association, has now gained such power that it threatens both  the freedom of teachers as individuals and citizens' control of  education".  At their first annual  convention the BCC. Value School  Association passed this resolution:  "The B.C. Value School Association  urges that the Provincial Government  take steps to ensure that public  school education be effectively in  the control of elected representatives. To this end we urge that  the government preserve the "chain  of authority" from the provincial  government and local boards of  school trustees through district  superintendents of schools and principals to school staffs."  Recognize that this opposition x^ill  be highly organized — they will  make use of the media and other publicity outlets, and will probably  run candidates for the School Boards •>  Be organized, knowledgeable and articulate and run and support supportive School Board candidates  yourself.  4) Get to know your local school —  meet the teachers, are the staff  rooms segregated (guess which staff  room important decisions are dis- 15  education  cussed and made)? Do male students  go to a male counsellor and female  students to a female counsellor?  Are there female students in the  traditionally male courses and vice  versa?  (Watch out for copouts like  Powder Puff Mechanics and Bachelor  Survival Cooking).  Is the athletic  program for boys rich and healthy  and that for girls a poor waif?  5) Get involved in a community  action group (start one if you have  to) and be willing to commit some  time and energy.  If we are going  to flatten out the power structure  -that 'chain of authority' — so  that the people of the community  truly have voice in the decisionmaking process then we must be willing to take the responsibility for  attaining and utilizing this power.

IWY  STILL NO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION!  CANADIAN MAGAZINE  AUGUST 2Ist,I976  betty lee  I take back all those cranky things  I've said about Health and Welfare  Minister Marc Lalonde and the way he  casually tossed International Women's  5fear into the Out Basket on Dec. 31,  1975.  All this time, it seems, IWY has been  lurking in the computers of Decision  Marketing Research in Toronto and all  this time, the computers have been  working on a question that nagged  many of us during The Year: would  $5-million worth of advertising, patronage and programmed ballyhoo alter  attitudes toward the unequal status  of women in this country? The ansx^er,  I think, is worth the mere $110,000  that DMR was paid to dig it out. Yes,  but so what? The survey found, among  other things, that some Canadians  shifted to a more liberal stance on  the entire spectrum of equality be-*  tween men and women.  But almost as  many Canadians felt threatened by  the concept and retreated into  tougher positions. What we bought  with those 5 million IWY smackeroos,  we learn to our interest, was virtual stalemate.  "Changes in society are slower than  one would think and hope for," remarked Lalonde with unexpected candor  when he released the research study  recently. Then he trotted out those  perished old Band-Aids, the Human  Rights Bill (yes, Virginia, it will  see more action in the next session  of Parliament) and fatter handouts  to women's organizations. As far as  the pesky attitude issue is concerned,  it is all a matter of "keeping on the  pressure" and "prodding along" (or  did the minister really say "plodding"  ?) with existing structures. Though  now, of course, he added - tapping  his dossier of information - the  government had something useful on  which to base future policy.  But how useful, exactly? Well,  there's that highly-instructive codicil to IWY, coupled with the comforting fact (for Lalonde and IWY secretariat, anyway) that 86 percent of all  Canadians knew that 1975 was International Women's Year and 74 percent  had heard tell of the Why Not! campaign. The government now officially  knows (even though women's groups have  been saying so for years) that only  half of the population is aware of  agencies with which complaints about  job discrimination can be lodged.. And  just 13 percent have heard of the  various provincial women's bureaus.  Now, the government at last has it  confirmed - the protesters can stop  winging all those briefs to Ottawa -  that almost four in 10 Canadians  agree that women should be paid less  than men because they are potentially  less stable employees. That one-third  of Canadians who have public school  education or less support discrimination on the basis of sex. That 28  percent of the population prefers to  work for a ma,le rather than a female  boss whether he is "competent or not.  That - really and truly, Mr. Lalonde  - 19 percent of Canadians believe  that men should always be given preference over women, whatever the job.  Ottawa now knows for sure that those  Canadians over 15 who believe that  men and women can have equal capabilities and should share responsibilities  in a marriage are a minority group  (18 percent) in this country. That a  whopping 54 percent of the adult population (the percentage remained static  during IWY) still slot women and men  into the roles they have been traditionally been stuck with for centuries.  That 6 percent of Canadians (22 percent of them men) believe that women  outclass men in every kind of professional and domestic job while men  are only good at painting the outside  woodwork and buying the booze. That  15 percent of the population (28 percent of them women) believe women  should be running nothing more complicated than a pop-up toaster and that  the only joint family decisions should  be those involving holidays.  The figures are entertaining to read.  But all that's really new to concerned  Equality Watchers is the Good Housekeeping Seal of market-research approval. Plus a snippet I gleaned from  DMR's figures concerning agreement  among Canadians on the key question of  equal pay. Although 87 percent of  adult Canadians say they support this  issue, there was a 2 percent slip to  an opposite opinion in the Prairies,  Ontario, and Quebec during IWY.  The  Atlantic Provinces registered a 5  percent negative shift and the only  gain was in British Columbia where  7 percent more individuals backed  the concept.  Time to believe the surveys and dust  off Affirmative Action, Lalonde? 16-  WOMEN'S FILMS/SLIDES  CANADIAN FILMMAKERS DISTRIBUTION  CENTRE has a number of films on the  status of women: AFTER THE VOTE,  THE STATUS OF WOMEN: STRATEGY FOR  CHANGE, color/sound, 30 minutes,  $30 rental from CFD at 406 Jarvis  Street, Toronto, Ontario.

HANSARD/LETTER LOBBY  Letter Lobby is concerned with a number of issues that have been raised  in the House of Commons during June  and July.  In most cases, MPs asked  permission to present a motion on a  women's issue but without unanimous  consent were unable to do so. Unless  you write the MP in question, your  own MP, the Prime Minister and/or  the cabinet minister concerned -  these vital questions will not be  discussed in Parliament.  Address -  House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.  Anti-Inflation Program  Mr. Les Benjamin (NDP Regina-Lake  Centre) called on the government to  establish on a mandatory basis the  permissive clause which is supposed  to eliminate sex discrimination in  pay practices during the guideline  period.  Right now it is up to the  employer to recommend x^age increases  above the guidelines when sex discrimination can be proven. You can  rest assured that not one case has  come before the Anti-Inflation Board  via this route.  The government has  done nothing to publicize this clause  - they say it is up to women's groups.  The truth is that if too many female  workers were to be axjarded increases  in excess of the guidelines (even  though warranted), the anti-inflation  program xrould be seriously jeopardized.  Please urge your MPs to persist x^ith  this line of questioning.  (July 7,  1976 Hansard)  No-fault Divorce  Mr. Eldon Woolliams (PC Calgary North)  questioned Justice Minister Ron Basford regarding no-fault divorce and  a uniform maintenance rule as recommended by the Lav; Reform Commision in  17  letter  lobby  their report.  Basford replied that  he would be meeting with the provincial attorneys general later in June.  "Any action to be taken by the  federal government or any measures  to be introduced to the federal parliament will depend on the nature of  those consultations and discussions,"  Basford said.  Write Eldon Woolliams and urge him  to question the Justice Minister  further on the June meeting when  Parliament resumes. Write Basford  and urge him to prod the provinces.  A uniform law will require the full  cooperation of federal and provincial officials - so write to our  provincial attorney general, Hon.  Garde Gardom, with a copy to Mr.  Basford.  (June 14, 1976 Hansard)  Increased Child Care Allowances  Miss Coline Campbell (LIB Nova Scotia  and Parliamentary Secretary to Hugh  Faulkner) congratulated Finance Minister Donald Macdonald on the Dro-  vision in his Budget which increased  the allowances for child care.  I  wrote her a letter stating that  women's groups" welcomed this increase  - but with reservations. There are  limitations.  The provision will benefit only those  persons x*ho can afford, and then find,  adequate day care in licenced day  care centres.  It is of no value  whatsoever to working people who must  rely on friends or relatives to care  for their children.  The catch is  that it is impossible to get receipts  for income tax purposes which are  necessary to make a claim.  It just  wouldn't be worth it for a woman to  babysit for someone, declare the  small income and then lose all or  part of her husband's married status  exemption.  (A married woman is allowed to earn only $334 per year tax-  free) .  The Letter Lobby Committee already  dealt with this in April Kinesis but  please write again to Coline Campbell.  Point out to her the legislation's  shortcomings and urge her to impress  them on the Finance Minister and  Revenue Minister, Bud Cullen.  Send  copies to Hon. Marc Lalonde and/or  the Prime Minister.  The Royal Commission on the Status of Women (1970)  recommended many changes in the Income Tax Act regarding women and the  Advisory Council on the Status of  Women has just released an excellent  study - "Women and the Personal  Income Tax System". Write for it -  A.C.S.W., 63 Sparks Street, Ottawa,  read it and then urge the federal  government to take some action on this  important matter.  They have to date  completely ignored the recommendations  of the A.C.S.W.  (June 10, 1976  Hansard)  After what seemed to be a very long  "non-summer" the Letter Lobby Committee is back in action again.  New  members are welcome - please phone  the office for the date of our October meeting.  We hope to tackle many  old and some new issues this fall -  your ideas are needed and welcomed.  Dorothy Holme  Coordinator  WRITE A LETTER!-  General Interest  Attorney-General Garde Gardom advises  that since the task force on affirmative action made its recommendations  to his department in January this  year, "officials have been asked to  direct their energies toward the upgrading of training programs throughout the justice system.  It is our  hope that by upgrading our training  capacity within the Department, we  might begin to create more opportunity  for all individuals disproportionately  represented in the Department, including handicapped persons, all  minority groups, and women."  We aren't satisfied with this kind of  an answer.  If you aren't either,  write to The Honourable A. G., Garde  Gardom, at Parliament in Victoria,  asking him to do more than upgrade  training programs, to fully enact the  recommendations for affirmative action  as proposed to him by his own task  force.  "By nice women...you probably mean  selfish women who have no more thought  for the underprivileged, overworked  women than a pussycat in a sunny window  for the starving kitten in the street.  Now in that sense I am not a nice  woman, for I do care."  - Nellie McClung, The Stream Runs  Fast, 1945.  Women in Engineering Report Delayed:  Provincial Highways Minister Alex  Fraser advised VSW recently that the  report of the Task Force on Women in  Engineering was submitted three months  ago in rough draft and has yet to be  typed, edited and published by the  government, "because of pressure of  work and shortage of staff." Reports  of this nature are notoriously slow  to be processed by the civil service,  especially in regard to women's  issues. To speed up the process,  write to Mr. Fraser at Parliament in  Victoria, requesting a copy.  Basford Declines Comment on Abortion  Federal Justice Minister Ron Basford  recently declined personal comment  on abortion on the grounds that since  the report of the Committee on the  Operation of the Abortion Law has not  been made, "it would, therefore, be  inappropriate for me to comment at  the present time on any possible  changes in the law." However, he  would be "most happy to receive all  statements of public opinion in this  regard."  Women's Legislation: The new federal  human rights bill C-72 has not yet  gone beyond first reading in the House  of Commons. Justice Minister R.cn  Basford says other priorities have  delayed discussion of the bill and  he hopes it x^ill be dealt with early  in the next session.  In order to  make sure this happens, write to him,  carbon copy to your MP, urging passage  of the bill and stating vour criticisms  of it.  CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT  A sub-committee set up by the National  Advisory Council on the Status of  Women to examine Bill C-72 . the proposed Canadian Human Rights Act, has  issued some strong criticisms of the  Act. Terming the bill "legislative  hocus-pocus" they point out that the  bill, which borrows heavily and almost  directly from the Canada Labour Code,  does not include any improvements in  the equal pay area and does not introduce the equal pay for v/ork of equal  value concept from the International  Labour Organization convention that  was ratified by the Canadian government in 1972. The sub-committee alsc  points out that the new sections or.  pensions and benefits contain far too  many loopholes for employers. 18  YOU & THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT OF FAMILY COURT ORDERS  This is the fourth in a series of  articles about Family Court.  Previous articles discussed the orders  which a Family Court Judge can make.  This article will discuss the  enforcement of support orders. Support orders were discussed in the  first article.  When a husband does not pay support  payments to his wife, the wife should  immediately contact the local Family  Court and ask to speak to the enforcement officer.  The Family Court  enforcement officer will help you to  collect payments due under Family  Court support orders, and under  support orders made by a Supreme  Court Judge, i.e. at the time of a  divorce, if they are registered in  Family Court.  There is also a procedure whereby a  mere agreement in writing to pay  support, (i.e. a separation agreement)  as opposed to an actual court order,  can be registered in Family Court.  The terms as to support and custody  can then be enforced by the Family  Court enforcement officer, in the  same way as a court order.  There are several ways in which the  enforcement officer can attempt to  collect the money owing to you. He  can have your husband's employer  ordered to pay a certain percentage  of your husband's wages to the court.  This is called garnishing wages. If  you know of other people who owe  your husband money, i.e. his bank,  you can ask the officer to have a  garnishing order served on that  person. The person owing the money  pays it to the Court rather than your  husband, and you are given the  amount owing to yout  Another procedure is called execution  against lands or chattels.  The support order can be registered against  the title to property held in your  husband's name.  If the property is  sold, you are paid from the proceeds. You can also take steps to  have the property sold in order to  receive your money. Also, you can  have other goods that your husband  owns seized and sold, i.e. his furniture and car.  The most common procedure followed  has been for the Family Court to  summon your husband before a Judge  to "show cause" why he has not paid.  If he does not have a good reason,  i.e. sickness or unemployment, he is  ordered to pay by a certain time or  he is held to be in contempt of  court.  Your husband can avoid these methods  of enforcement by moving to an unknown location, or to a place xvhich  does not have a reciprocal agreement  with British Columbia for the enforcement of support agreements.  (Check with Family Court as to  which places have such agreements.)  Even where there are arrangements for  reciprocal enforcement, the procedure  is very slow and time consuming.

NO   UIC  i No UIC for Adoptive Mothers: George  I Lambert, Departmental Assistant to  : federal Minister of Manpower Robert  ; Andras,- recently advised VSW that an  adoptive mother cannot be said to be  ; incapable of work and consequently  "it is not possible to consider  granting her maternity benefits."  j He argues that maternity benefits  j are designed to protect a woman  j against loss of earnings due to  pregnancy and a woman's eligibility  for IUC is in recognition that she  is physically incapacitated due to  childbirth. Maternity benefits, he  says, are not paid to a woman because  of the actual presence of a new child  and therefore an adoptive mother,  although required to stay home with  a new child in order to fulfill legal  obligations of adoption, is not  eligible. port alberni  Dear Sisters:  Another Women's Centre has bit the  dust — this time Port Alberni's.

One of Muriel's dreams was for the  Maple Ridge Hospital to have in the  garden " a quiet place" where patients  who needed privacy and solitude could  find it. To make this dream come true,  the members of Muriel's CR Group have  started the Muriel Franklin Memorial  Trust Fund. This fund needs your donations, for example, one family allowance cheque or whatever is possible  for you to give.

WHAT'S  GOING  ON?  kitimat  Kitimat Women's Job Survey: Preliminary data from a survey on employment needs of women undertaken by  Kitimat Women's Organization indicate  that women working at Alcan generally  have school-age children or no children. Many women with small kids  would like part-time 9 to 3 jobs that  would allow more time for the family.  Early planners of Kitimat did not  envisage women in the workforce in  the past-war years but did plan special provisions for women, such as extra indoor space for childcare etc.  They predicted dissatisfaction amongst  women in the area would create unhappy  workers resulting in high turnover and  damage to production-.  ndp  Federal NDP Women's Organizer Needed  The position of federal women's organizer for the NDP party is now  vacant, after the dismissal of Ann  Dewitt.  Ed Broadbent, federal leader of the NDP, says there is no  plan to do away with the position  which was established in 1973 by  convention resolution. However,  the federal executive has decided  not to advertise the vacancy. At  the next meeting- of the federal  executive the chairwoman of the NDP  Women's Committee, Betty McClurg  plans to introduce a motion that the  position be advertised and filled  immediately. All NDP members are  asked to x^rite to their federal executive, and their MPs insisting that  the past of wcmen's organizer be  filled immediately.

Lots of simpering and lines  like "because it makes me feel  pretty," and "lifts and separates".  In the spirit of fair play Nina  Fulford has decided to give men's  underwear equal time.  MEDIA  SURVEY  Media are included in COMMUNITY SURVEY  ON THE STATUS OF WOMENs a how-to kit  for determining the "position of women  in the institutions of your community"  prepared by the Organization Liaison  Division of the Population Institute  and released June 1975.  The booklet covers, in addition to  media, inquiries into the status of  women in these other areas of community life: law, education, government  and politics, health, culture and  recreation, business and finance,  labour and religion. It suggests  questions to ask; tells how to coIt.  lect data, compute statistics, and  compare them to national figures;  and then proposes ways to use the  data (including tips on getting coverage of your findings) and several  follow-up actions.  The suggested questions to survey the  status of women in local media were  the following:  1. Is the publisher(owner) of your  local newspaper a man or a woman?  Editor-in-Chief? (Call and ask or  look at the masthead of the paper).  2. On the T.V. channels you receive,  what percentage of the reporters on  the local news shows are women? (Call  the station and ask and/or watch the  daily broadcast three times for each  time slot and count.)  3. On a given Sunday, xfhat percentage  of T.V. interview hosts (local and  national programs) are women? What  percentage of their guests are women?  4. On any two local radio stations,  what percentage of disc jockeys are  women? (Call the general manager of  the station and ask and/or listen  and count for yourselfe)  THE COMMUNITY SURVEY ON THE STATUS OF  WOMEN costs $2 and is obtainable from  the Organization Liasion Division,  The Population Institute, 110 Maryland  Avenue,NoE., Washington DC 20002."  -reprinted Media Report to Women subscribe!

Angela Page's review of the textbook  Laura Secord included the rhetorical  question, "Is it uniquely Canadian to  turn popular female figures into  brands of Candy?"  To set matters straight, this is not  a uniquely Canadian syndrome (very  little of our culture is!) In the U.S.,  where "heroine candy" likely got its  start, children suck on sweets from  the "Barbara Fritchie" shops. And for  those who have forgotten their Civil  War history, Ms. Fritchie uttered the  immortal line "Shoot if you must this  old gray head, but spare your country's  flag."  So much for Canadiana in the candy  shop.  Heather Dodds  North Vancouver, B.C.  KINESIS:  I read KINESIS through from beginning  to end each month and have kept all  copies as reference material.

Linda Pugh  Vancouver, B.C  KINESIS:  Regarding the recent news story concerning the lack of a woman representative on the Royal Bank's board of  directors, I suggest all women who  are currently using this bank's  services change to another h^nk  (and let the manager know w<\, .  It is obvious that the Royal Bank's  management is not interested in having a significant part of its  clientele represented.  If they are  disinterested, xtfomen would be better  off served elsewhere.
