Vancouver 8, B. C.  3  International Women's Year is like  a pomegranate: promising on the outside but filled with precious little  meat, yet faintly appealing In its  exotic rarity whatever Its deficiencies. The deficiencies are many:  insufficient funds, insufficient  committment on the part of the government to provoking real change, the  preplanning of activities without  considering the real needs of women,  ad nauseum.  I do not choose to ignore these deficiencies silently, but I cannot help  but question the psychology that always chooses to focus on what has not  been accomplished. International  Women's Year is doomed from the start  if we choose to focus only on what  IWY will not be (everything we want)  and therefore refmse to participate  thus fulfilling our own prophesy.  I  cannot see the point of exercises  which are designed to fail because  polarization rather than achievement  is the goal.  I see what others decry  as "tokenism" as at least some reg-  ognition on the part of the government, that we cannot" be entirely ignored. Today's token is tomorrow's  force to be reckoned with.  Any criticism of IWY must take into  account, moreover, that IWY is not  taking place in a vacuum; inflation  not IWY is the issue of the day and  the former has great influence on  funding and on the amount of consideration the government is willing to  give IWY.  I see IWY as a time for celebration  of what we have achieved, not enough  but something. After all women's  liberation is no longer a complete  joke. I see IWY as a time for celebrating all the talents women have,  talents which are too often belittled.  I see IWY as a time of celebration  for all women, a chance for all.  women to come together, feminist and  non-feminist, to share the things we  as women have in common.  We want "bread", the government offers  circuses. My hope for IWY is that  we can press them for more "bread"  and yet enjoy a little of the circus,  too, because a little circus is good  for the soul.  To return to the pomegranate, there  isn't much that's edible in IWY but  why not take what we can get.  "Something is better than nothing," so  the maxim goes.  -Roberta Schlosberg  (President VSW) suggestion    for   iwy  Let's develop a sort of theorem, Not  to worry, Pythagoras. But it might  make a point.  (a) A quotation - "Because the Commission thought it important that the  report receive wide distribution and  that it be financially within the  reach of most Canadians, we decided  to reduce the great wealth of material which we had studied into a single  volume." - from the Foreword to the  Royal Commission Report on the Status  of Women in Canada. (Underlining ours)  (b) There are roughly 8 million Canadian women over the age of 15 and  roughly an equivalent number of men.  (c) As of the end of August of this  year, there had been printed, since  the Royal Commission Report was first-  published in 1970. 19,200 copies in  English, of which 2,824 remained in  stock. Of the 4,100 copies printed  in French, 446 remained in stock.  (Figures obtained from Information  Canada by the office of Dr. Katie  Cookfc)  (d) The Report costs $4.95.  (e) Another quotation - "The government's program (for International  Women's Year) ... includes an information and educational campaign to  bring the issues before the public."  - The Honourable Marc Lalende, Minister Responsible for the Status of  Women in Canada, from an address in  the House of Commons, October 15,1974.  (f) No other account available (and  certainly no series of advertising  blurbs) can, or could, inform and  educate the public about the position of women in Canada and what  should be done to improve it as can  The Royal Commission Report.  (g) It is very often the case that  when a product of high quality is  offered for sale in quantity at a  less costly price than previously,  the increased volume of sales compensates, or more than compensates,  for the cost of increasing production.  Therefore, a meaningful gov-  erment contribution to International Women's Year would  be an appreciable reduction  in the cost of the Royal  Commission Report on the  Status of Women in Canada.  Q.E.D.  A theorem is supposed to speak for  itself, but herewith a few additional words.  We are all aware that some legislative reforms have been made since the  Report was published and that others  are in the process of being made.  The government is to be commended for  the steps it has so far taken. Perhaps it would consider publishing a  revised version of the Report in which  reforms are acknowledged and some  statistics (not always for the better)  are brought up to date. Perhaps a  supplement could be issued.  But whether or not revisions, in any  form are made, the bulk of the material in the Report remains fully relevant. Very much has yet to be achieved, through both legislation and  changes in social attitudes, before  what is said, for example, about the  inequalities, in employment opportunities, sex-role conditioning in  -education and the media, day care  needs, abortion and birth control,  the many women in poverty, and the  few women in public office is no longer applicable. These are only a few  of the areas of concern with which  the Report deals. Concern is here,  in chapter after chapter: concern  that injustice exists and concern  that it can be removed.  Unlike some reports commissioned by  governments, this one is compelling-  ly readable.  It has not received  the "wide distribution" the Commission hoped for and we do not consider  that, at its present price, it is  "financially within the reach of most  Canadians".  We are planning to write to Mr. Lalonde proposing a substantial reduction.  It would be gratifying, if ypu  favour the idea, to hear from you.  -B.P. INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR FOR YOU!.'  International Women's Year activities  that don't necessarily need funding    take it upon yourself to mount a  letter writing campaign on a certain  issue that offends you, or that you  would like to see changed.   research a specific legislative  problem - make yourself the resident  expert on it and communicate with  the government on it.   set yourself the goal of making  more women aware of what the woman's  . movement is all about - in some cases  that means learning more about it  yourself - so do some reading, put  together a few speech ideas and let  other organizations in your area know  that you would be willing to speak  to them on the topic of the women's  movement,etc.  ~—if you work with children, do  as much as you can to introduce non-  sexist texts and books into their  education.   find out who the BCTF status of  women contact person is in your district (call your local superintendent,  or talk to the principal of the high  school - or the guidance counsellor)  and ask her to come and speak to your  wpmen's group. Linda Shuto, Status  of Women Co-ordinator at BCTF sends  each contact person reams of info  re sexism in the schools and how to  combat it - make her share it around,  and help her share it around.   make a conscious effort to treat  every male and female around you in  a totally non-sexist manner - it's  amazing how quickly it becomes unconscious habit!   can you write? Do you have thoughts  about being a woman? Write a specific  article and send it to the local paper -  pointing out tha£ it is International  Women's Year, etc etc and how about  publishing more articles by and about  women.   do something for yourself, do something with your group, do something  for women during International Women's  Year!  deai   suggest to your children's high  school teacher that they have a  "career night" at school and offer  yourself to speak on the changing  role of women in work - or arrange  for women you know who are In traditionally male occupations to speak.   if your local library and bookstores do not have non-sexist kids  books, or a meagre supply of feminist  women's books, get together a booklist (we have one for kids books)  and push them into doing some serious  buying!  —in your women's group,  begin a letter lobby committee.   talk to your mother.   talk to your daughter.  ,-—learn about the suffragettes.  Take a women's studies course at a  nearby college, university. Recognize  your history.   do you feel articulate about the  happenings of the women's movement?  Do you know of people who can speak  on it? Approach your local community  centre or school and arrange to put  on a speaker's night - or- a mini lecture series with topics revolving  around education, employment, etc etc.  Have the group break into discussion  groups later.  The dove of International Women's Year  The International Women's Year Dove  will fly - hopefully! Hopefully  we will see it on TV, in newspapers,  in magazines and books, on government  publications, on jewelery and of  course on T shirts!It's an attractive  design and it stands for a great deal  - the mathematical sign for equality,  the biological symbol for the develop-  Ement of women, and the dove for peace.  These are the three themes of International Women's Year and it is hoped  that 1975 will begin substantial,  continuing programs that will help  women throughout the world.  The UN secretary-general's office  has announced that although the  emphasis of IWY75 will be on the  national level, the UN is organizing  special acts of commemoration, publicity and education campaigns and  international symposiums. The biggest of these events will be a conference in June in Bogata, Columbia.  Remember International Women's Year  is OUR year !! There will be international conferences and there will  be groups with government funding  [working on projects and programs all  over .Canada. But this 1h not enough  Lon its own. Each and every one of  us can be involved in IWY75!  pn this page are some ideas to inspire  you. Remember this is OUR year -  LLet' s make it the" start of something  ■great!   don't put down other women. Try  not to be in the usual kind of feminine  competition - gossip,etc. Read about  why women do this to each other.  —inform as many media outlets as  possible about International Women's  Year, tell them you would like to see  the logo used on T.V. more and more  attention given to women's stories -  GOOD ones!   research our socialization as women - once  you know why its there  then you can do some  changing.   treat yourself to something you've always  wanted—you're wor£h it!  «■—if you haven't already - teach  ,your children and husband how to cook.  —. IdeasrDiana Bissell . •  Graphics-Janet Janovich aooa-Due  acne  J Gene Errington has been appointed  Provincial Co-ordinator of the Status  of Women for International Women's  Year, 1975. Her friends at VSW will  miss her strong gentle voice, her  wise judgment and her excellent leadership. At the same time, we recognize the importance of having someone  3 of Gene's calibre in this new office,  ene t became Ombudswoman in September of  of 1973. Since that time she has  spearheaded briefs on numerous aspects  of legislation and has represented  the VSW on committees and at hearings.  She is:  a member of the Human Rights  Commission of B.C.  a member of the Family Law  Subsection, B.C. Bar Association  a working committee member o*  the Royal Commission on Family  and Children's Law  a Board Member of the B.C.  Civil Liberties Association  a Board member of the Senate  [of the University of B.C.  very woman who has needed Gene's  assistance has been touched by her  compassion, her concern, and her  efforts to solve the problem. We  have all been sustained through our  trials and triumphs by her spirit.  Gene, please know that our thoughts  and our support will be with you  always.  A TALK WITH GENE ERRINGTON  J: When did you first become interested and involved in the women's  movement?  GENE:  It was really about five years  ago. I was taking Sociology at UBC.  I knew about the women's movement of  course.  I even knew some women'in  my classes who were involved in it,  but I didn't pay much attention. Like  a lot of women, I just couldn't see  the problem I felt "I'm independent.  I have my own car,etc"* Then in a  Time Magazine I came across an article  by Gloria Steimem .  She was talking  about Kate Millet and her book Sexual  Politics. What Gloria Steinem said  about the man/women relationships  that are explored in that book really  interested me.  So I got a copy and  read it.  It was like a blinding flash!  Kate Millet articulated so clearly  the things I had experienced myself,  the feelings I had!  J: Did it make you want to get involved in the women's movement?  GENE: «Yes, I joined a consciousness  raisingi groups at UBC. And then  when Anne Pitre organized the first  Women Studies Program at UBC I was  one of the seminar leaders.  J: Do you remember just when that  was?  GENE: Well, I remember it was just  after Prime Minister Trudeau was  married because the slogan for the  program was "There are eight million  other women in the world besides  Margaret Trudeau."  J: Were you involved with Vancouver  Status of Women at this time?  GENE: I was working with Rosemary  Brown on her campaign for'Ombudswoman,  and I <, had "joined: VSR but I wasn't  an active member. Then when Rosemary  won the NDP nomination she asked if  I wanted to run for her Ombudswoman  position and I was elected.. It was  a part time position then and I was  working on my thesis in Sociology as  well. Then when we got some more  money it became a full time position  and I was re-elected. And I've been  here ever since! That's about two  and a half years now.  J: Do you think the ombudservice.  has grown or changed over that time?  GENE: Oh, yes! I think it has grown  in two ways in particular::originally  the service was set up in a way where  women phoned in or wrote in about a  specific problem and the Ombudswoman  and her staff would deal with that  problem.  It provided individual sdr-  vice.  Now the ombudservice still provides  individual service but through doing  this, it is now able to see patterns -  to see beyond each individual problem and fit them into the whole picture. We can work as a lobbying force  and get actively involved and seek  out problem, areas - for example,  our work with immigrant women in the  labour force, with high school women,  women in unions, with family courts.  We're acting now, not just reacting.  J: What do you see in the future for  the ombudservice?  GEHE : I think it is important that  the ombudservice keeps growing and  changing.  I hope it will continue  to provide women with individual service , to seek out problem areas, to  be a watchdog over legislation and  policy.  It is important that we get  into policy making areas too - some of  of us are on vaeious boards and commissions such as the Human Rights Commission , the B.C. Civil Liberties  Association , the Royal Commission  on Family and Children's Law.  We must get all kinds of women involved!  I feel one of the good things  about us at VSW is that we are interested in all women's problems - we  doa't limit our concern to those problems that we experience personally.  We must encourage more and more women  to become involved in dealing with  their problems.  J: How do you feel about leaving the  VSW Ombudswoman position then?  GENE: Terrible! The suppoct and  warmth and sisterhood in this office  is wonderful!  I know I will never  work in another place like this.  J: What about the new job? How do  you feel about that?  GENE:  Well, I feel its going to be  a challenge! I accepted the job because it was presented ao me as a  serious job which offered the oppoet-  unity to work for change. We know  from past experience that some jobs  are gestures. But I feel this one  was sincerely and seriously presented.  I want to point out that women should  not relax now becuase I'm "over there  taking care of business." It is up  to women to let me and the government  know when thinga are not good enough,  to pressure for what they want.  There have been a few fears expressed that women won't be able to deal  directly with government members on  women's issues now that my position  has been created. But this is not  so! I intend to be a channel but not  a barrier to separate women from the  government! Women must continue to  put pressure on the MLA's and the  government ministers and the premier  to get things dona. This is very  important!  J: Do you think this appointment  indicates an improvement in the government 's dealings with women?  GENE: Well, its a step in the right  direction. At least they're taking  us seriously.  It was emphasized to  me that the position was just for one  year - just for International Women's  Year - but that the government intends  ti use this year to make permanent  changes. WS hope so. -?.. A4  worm's  pkw&  cap college  Capilano College has announced their  new schedule of courses.The list is  a lengthy one and space is:limited  so only the ones beginning in January.

LETTER LOBBY  We have had several letters from  Marc Lalonde concerning our comments  on the Omnibus Bill on the Status of  Women, which is now in committee after first reading in the house. He  clarified a number of questions we  had concerning the limitation clause  of the Public Service Commission and  the use of the words "he" and "his"  with neutral words such as spouse.  Apparently the Interpretation Act  of 1967-8 provides with regard to  gender, that the words importing  male persons include female persons.  Ho hum. He also said that the present government recognizes "the  importance of the proposed legislation to establish the Human Rights  Commission and it is proposed to  bring this legislation before the  House during this session of Parliament". He had praise for the activities of the Letter Lobby, and assurances to all members of Status of  Women that he takes very seriously  his responsibilities to improve the  position of women in society. The  Letter Lobby Committee suggests that  you make every effort to keep in  touch with Lalonde if you are truly  concerned about women's issues.  It  is up to all of us to put the pressure on during International Women's  Year. Letter Lobby met December 3  and will meet again Tuesday, January  7 at 8 pm in the office.  WRITER'S WORKSHOP  The Writer'8 Workshop, under  direction of Carmel McDougall  has been meeting bi-weekly at  the Status of women office.  Various types of writing have  been undertaken and examined;  descriptive essays, dialogues and  journal pages to name a few. At  the last session we attempted a  group interview, a novel project  which proved highly informative.  Assignments are read aloud by  the writer, held up to the group's  constructive criticism, then subjected to Carmel's scrutiny and  awesome editor's pencil!! The  workshop is still open to new members,  meetings are stimulating, educational  and have a habit of adjourning to the  nearest pub, where a few devoted members usually close the bar. For details about the date of the next  meeting please contact the office  at 736-3746.  -Anna de Bakker  NEW WOMEN'S GROUPS  Women Together—is the name of a  new group that meets in the Richmond  area, usually at the Crisis Centre  out there.

There are, believe it or not, other  things in this world besides the Arts  and why I never sensed it or realized  it before I don't know. Berating myself and blaming others - why didn't  they ever tell me? - will do no good.  For one thing, even if anyone had  told me back in Grade 10, what would  it have been? - "Don't drop science,  you may need it someday." "Math is  a basic subject everyone should have."  Maybe they did tell me, I don't remember .  I was stubborn, I had my mind set on  other things, yet I was so ignorant:  I had never heard Of forestry, commerce, economics, chemistry, etc. The  ones I did have a vague knowledge of  seemed dull to me.  I could not see  where they led. But walking around  UBC today - through the engineering,  agriculture, forestry and chemisty  buildings - it is very obvious that  something important is going on here,  or something that is,at least, highly  valued by our society.  Nothing is what it all seems to amount  to.  I do not regret learning Spanish,  French, German and English but I do  resent the time. It was too much.  Languages are only tools after all,  and what is a tool without the materials necessary to work with?  Literature is a very interesting and  rewarding area of work and study but  what is literature when one has cut  oneself off from all the other happen-,  ings of one's time? Literature is the  study of all womankind.* What then is  the study of animals? chemicals? space?  ecology? Surely it is a certain  type of literature too. Why was this  never pointed out to me before? Why  are the comments of teachers and high  school guidance counsellors so nebulous?  Someone has just slammed the heel of  her'palm against my forehead and I'm  aghast at what I have missed and why  I missed it.  It is because as a woman  there was no value, in fact it might  even have been dangerous, to train  me in any of these disciplines for  obviously they lead to powerful positions in the structure of our society,  possibly giving me the power, if not  to change the established order, then  at least to disrupt it while it choked  on me and spat me out.  I am a writer, but that doesn't mean  I can't be a chemist, an engineer,  an economist, a forester as well.  Perhaps that is why they are all dead  - Holliday, Joplin, Plath, Sexton.  They struggled all their lives for  power, the ability to demand respect,  to be believed when they spoke. They  never attained that power; there is  no guarantee that any of us alive today ever will ever be women who possess it if we don't demand it and earn  the right to it now.  There are many people I know, women  in particular, both in the movement  and out, who will say, as my roommate  did last night, that I am powertripp-  ing and will ask who needs this power  anyway. Well, if they don't want it  they will probably never have it and  will suffer the consequences as well.  What is life or study or thougnt  worth if no one1 ever believes you for  it? A great deal, I suppose in one  way it is the same kind of unrecognized, anonymous suffering that has led  to the one popular saying that behind  every great man is a woman. That has  been changed in modern times to read  beside every great man is a woman.  It must be changed again. Every great  person is surrounded by masses of  workers,in the same and different  disciplines,and each one of these  people has contributed a finger, a  palm, an arm to the task of supporting that great person.  Perhaps, then, the concept of 'great'  or 'genius' when used in this context  does not exist. These terms are isolates.  They suggest that Suddenly  out of the clouds of the 20th Century  sprung Sir Frederick Banting (for example) on a lab stool, the medical  equivalent of a white charger. He  drew out his litmus paper for all  humankind and proceeded to lay about  him with great and exhausting vigour.  But before him and contemporaneous  with him,,were a myriad of unknown  struggling researchers all striving  for that same fantastic substance  that would cure diabetes. There were  also many papers published, great  and small, established and maverick,  on the subject, whoever credited  (or credits now) the castaway line,  the glint of genius which sparked in  Banting's mind and resulted in the  discovery of insulin? They ride unnamed the anonymous waves of history  of womankind, written from the bias-  of the individual.  These so-called geniuses or great  people are merely the conglomeration  of all those who went before and beside them, and, granted that in all  likelihood they did possess some  individual attribute that may have  acted as a catalyst to the forces of  discovery, nevertheless one fact re  mains. They cannot be viewed alone.  They cannot be seen merely as great  isolated (phallic) pillars of wisdom  rising above the heads of an awe-  stricked human race. They are rather  the cornerstones, if you will, of the  pyramids.  This, believe it or not, brings me  bask; to the concept of powertripping,  for just as genius and great minds  do not live in solitude, nor does any  student, thinker or worker. How can  I, as student, thinker or worker, develop thoughts, theories, philosophies,  perspectives, techniques of expression if on all sides I am surrounded  by a barrier of "I don't believe you  because you're a woman"?  There are many people who would argue  that this barrier does not exist, and  that I am being supersensitive.  They  have not seriously considered the  matter.  Many and varied tests have been conducted, in particular in several American universities for example, with  unvarying results.  Sign a man's name  to a paper (or an article, or a speech,  or a discovery, or a suggestion )  and it will be believed more readily  than if a woman's name is on the same  Paper. This is a horrifying realization if one is a woman and one see-  it enacted frequently in one's everyday life.  What can be done about this or any  of the ancient problems facing womankind today, the female half in particular? The first thing is that we  must claim our power - the power within us and the power that exists , although not necessarily for the taking,  within our society.  We must constantly prove ourselves  stronger more intelligent, more  skilled, and more successful than  men, in order to be their equals.  And we must do more. We must keep  always in our minds and in our eyes,  the memory of how we have been opp**  ressed, the tactics and the symptons  of that oppression and the oppression  of similiar groups.  From these memories we must act, with  courage and determination, in order  that someday we, and all our kind,  are truly free.  - Lynne Batten  * here,and throughout the article,  womankind represents the human race  in its entirety. HIGH SCHOOL WORKSHOPS  Many teenagers have feelings and  questions about what it means to  be a young woman in today's society.  We at the Vancouver Status of Women  feel it is important to provide answers for those questions, and to provide an opportunity for those feelings  to be expressed and discussed further.  We have found during the course of  the numerous speaking engagements we  do at schools that the young women  are just beginning to open up and  investigate thoughts about the women's  movement at the end of our allotted  hour.  It seemed to us highly desirable to continue the conversation  away from the sterility of the classroom. As a result of this need we  planned a series of Workshops for  High School Women.  And they happened!! We have had two  very successful workshops this past  fall and the next one will be held  on Saturday, January 25 from 11am -  4pm.  Here's how they work-—we begin with  an introduction to Vancouver Status  of Women and the principles of the  women's movement (what we do and how  we do it and why). Then one guest  speaker gives her talk and there is  general discussion and questions for  a long time afterwards. Our speaker  at the next workshop will be Liz Whynot  a doctor at the Pine Street Clinic  who will lead a discussion on Health  as well as clueing us in as to what  is demanded of a woman studying to  be an M.D. these days.  After the speaker discussion is over  we try to keep things flexible. Usually there are specific mini-workshop  topics that people can decide to focus  on in small groups, or learning exercises that everyone can do. At the  last session we decided to investigate  sexism in advertising and spent the  afternoon ripping up magazines and  building some fantastic collages.  We also became very aware of the incredible sexist advertising all around  us. We try to leave these discussions and learning exercises as unstructured as possible so that the  students find out information for  themselves rather than listen to  staff members all the time.  If you are. a member who is in high  school, please consider yourself invited to our next workshop on Jan.25.  If you are a mother with teen age  please let her read this page.  If  you are a person who has some young  friends in high school, tell them  about it.  If you are a teacher, talk  to your students about coming to it.  If you have more questions, call  Nadine Allen or Diana Bissell at the  VSW office - 736-3746.  -Diana Bissell "  OUNG  Marlene Cliff - North Van - "The workshop was really fun ...we learned  alot about things I didn't know about  before."

Marial Melby - Surrey - "While we  were all there, and afterwards, I  felt really good about being female  —really strong."  Staff person Judy  Bourne makes a point  while in discussion  with Barbara   ^  MacDonald      * 10  let ten     lobby  Remember the VICTORY article in the  November issue of Kinesis? We were  jubilant because the PWA stewardesses  had been re-instated with back pay.  Well it seems that we were a little  too trusting. The Ministry of Labour,  granted pregnant stewardesses the right  to work as long as they felt physically  capable. PWA is ignoring that ruling  and demanding that they resign. Also,  the Ministry of Transport is considering ammendments to the Aeronautics  Act which will prohibit pregnant stewardesses from flying due to safety  reasons. The M o T regulations in  this area would override the Federal  Labour Code.  The Canadian Airline Flight Attendants Association feels that although  no one should be obliged to fly  while pregnant, any normal, healthy  flight attendant has the right to  decide for herself whether or not  she as an individual can meet the  requirements of her job. Hence the  letter to Jean Marchand of the Ministry of Transport.  If this situation makes you as indignant as it makes us then send off the  following letters right away.  The key point to remember in this  is that PWA is forcing pregnant stewardesses to resign long BEFORE they  are eligible for Unemployment Insurance Maternity Benefits and they are  NOT allowing them to take on any  other ground job, thereby forcing  these women to quit without remuneration solely because they are pregnant. That is a violation of the.  Federal Labour Code.  The letter to  Premier Lougheed of Alberta, (PWA  is owned by Alberta) informs him of  our distaste for his actions.  REMEMBER - letters carry MUCH more  impact if they are personally handwritten or typed and not just a form  letter clipped from the paper.  P.S. And, as you realize, the  ultimate insult in all this business  is the underlying principle that  pregnant women are not sexy, not  glamourous, not fit to look at, and  that they are sick. That attitude  belongs to the 18th century, not 1975.  Hon. Peter Lougheed,  Premier,  Parliament Buildings,  Edmonton, Alberta.  Dear Sir:  Last summer, shortly before the  province of Alberta bought Pacific  Western Airlines, the airline laid  off two stewardesses from the Vancouver base solely because they were  pregnant, a clear violation of the  Federal Labour Code. PWA was found,  after investigation, to be in  • violation of the law and agreed to  reinstate the stewardesses with back  pay from the time of the illegal lay  off. • The airline has since reneged  on that agreement, again violating  the law.  Such flagrant disregard of the law  and of the rights of female employees is most inappropriate for a  provincially owned corporation. We  urge you to make every effort to see  that PWA behaves in a law abiding  and humane manner and pays the women  in question the wages to which they  are entitled without the further  delay of a court action.  Yours sincerely,  Hon. Jean Marchand,  Minister of Transport,  Parliament Buildings,  Ottawa, Ontario  Dear Sir:  We understand that your ministry is  considering implementing regulations  which would prohibit pregnant stewardesses from working before the time  at which they are eligible for maternity leave under the Federal Labour  Code, and for maternity benefits from  the Unemployment Insurance Commission.  We feel that such regulations are  unnecessary and most unfair to stewardesses who wish to work and have  the permission of their doctors to  work well into their pregnancies.  If flying itself is thought to be  inherently unsafe for pregnant women,  then surely you will have to prohibit pregnant passengers from flying.  It seems to us that airline management is more concerned about the  appearance of stewardesses (sexy,  glamourous and shapely) than they  are about safety. Pregnancy is  not a sickness.  We urge you to follow the example of  the Federal Labour Code and continue  to allow any woman who is capable of  doing her job and who wishes to continue working, to work as a stewardess until eligible for maternity  leave under the Labour Code.

Dear People:  When you are writing to a MLA, MP,  company, advertiser, etc to object  to a sexist ad or some other form  of discrimination or to urge that  action be taken on an issue, it is  MUCH more effective if the letter  is your own not just a form letter  clipped from a paper. Use the Media  Action letter or Letter Lobby as a  guide if you wish,but your protest  certainly has more impact if it is  personally handwritten or typed.  More and more weople are no longer  tolerating the chwap, exploitative  tactics, such as yours, of using a  woman's body to sell consumer items.  We would find it equally unacceptable  and unethical to so use male sexuality,  but it is noteworthy that there was not  also a naked male in the picture.  We suggest that you re-examine your  thinking on this matter.  Your truly,  Red Baron Boutique  614 Trounce Alley  Victoria, B.C.  Dear People:  Enclosed is one of your ads appearing  in the UVIC Telephone Directory which  is demeaning to women.

It joins the oentres already  open in Victoria and Kamloops, and  the centre due to open in Prince  George in January.  These Centres are being set up by the  Department of Consumer Services which  is responsible for adminstering the  B.C. Trade Practices Act, the first  of its kind in Canada. The Act applies to any consumer transaction entered into after July 5, 1974, and  to earlier contracts that are "ren  negotiated,revised, extended, renewed, or otherwise modified" after July  5. The Department's aim is to stop  misleading and deceptive business  practices quickly and help consumers  recover their losses If someone has  taken advantage of them.  A Director of Trade Practices has  been appointed to handle consumer  complaints and investigate possible  wrongdoings.  The Consumer Service Centres, or  Store-front Offices, will be staffed  by counsellors,researchers and investigators. Ms. Young states that  her department deliberately sought  women to fill many of the top jobs.  She Vancouver office is headed by Ms.  Gladyes Johnsen and all of the staff  are women with the exception of one  man - a lawyer.  The Vancouver Centre works in conjunction with Debt Counselling although  they are not located in the same office.  important  VSW GENERAL MEETING SCHEDULE  The first three General Meetings of  the Vancouver Status of Women,for  1975 will be held on:  January 21  March 18  June 17  The meetings will be held in the Board  Room of the YWCA,580 Burrard St.  Vancouver, at 7/;30 pm.

One of the best shows I have  seen in this gallery."  "Far out!"  "A lot of fun - intriguing."  "Awful boring."  "Brilliant!"  These are some of the comments made  by people visiting Mary Gillie's  show which ran from September 11 to 29  in the Vancouver Art Gallery under  the title EXPLORATORY SPACE - an informal program of exhibitions by artists whose work is involved with non-  traditional ideas and materials.  Upon entering the two rooms housing  Mary Gillie's sculptures, % was confronted with maehlnes, wires, electric  hums and buzzes, sharp bangs, whining  sounds, a radio giving insignificant  news, and familiar and yet estranged  objects (a stove is not a stove is  not a stove...)  I met Mary Gillies, the electrician-  sculptress-artist to talk about her  work. As do the wires in her work,  so our conversation branched out and  off. Here are some exerpts:  Q; How did you become interested in  the medium "electricity"? Did you  have to 'conquer' electricity before  you were able to use it as an artistic  "medium"? I, myself, am quite scared  of it!  Mary: Electricity to me is something  mysterious. I find something religious  about it in trying to understand it.  It is invisible and yet so many of  our visible actions are caused by it  (switch oh - off...).  I found I could  not express my feelings about modern  life by static objects only.  I then  went to lots of exhibitions of kinetic  art In search for an answer, but I  found this an unsatisfying medium as  well - It all seemed a long way behind  actual life. Actual life to me is  expressed for example in Picadilly  Circus.  So I tried to use dome of  its elements. I have had some scientific education but knew nothing much  about electricity.  Fortunately I  found someone who was interested in my  ideas and who was able to teach me  what I had to know about electricity  in order to express myself.  (Mary wrote in Vanguard: "the inclus*-  ion of lights and sound within my  work is an attempt to come to terms  with electricity as a medium to be  treated as any other material with  definable characteristics and specific  visual-tactile-audio capabilities.  Philosophically^, t is for me a very  satisfying medium as it is in essence  an abstract made to have a viable  reality fy conversion into a sensory  form.  It relates most obviously to  the psychological processes of the  brain which are then transformed  into human action.")  Q: As an artist you want to become  clear about various questions and  express yourself in a very personal  way. At the same time it should be  13  general enough that you can communicate with the public. Your medium7  electricity^ belongs - so the popular  belief - to the male world. You express your feelings as a human being  and woman. Did you find that this  alienated you from the public? That  women could not identify with you  and men looked on you as an intruder?  Mary: This is very hard to answer.  I found that men reacted more directly and personally and this was often  felt as a threat by the young women  accompanying them. One electronic  engineer could not resist mentioning  that my electronics are very basic  - which I question. The most open-  minded people were middle aged women  with their children. They seemed to  *feel' art better.  As a rule women artists tend to be  conservative, less explorative in  materialsf It is not really our  fault but rather the result of conditioning.  I think that my exhibition is a surprise to both men and women because  it is kinetic and noisy,etc and this  is different from some sterotyped  image of a female sculptor.  Q: What was the attitude toward a  woman sculptor at school (in London,  England)?  Mary: There was the usual range of  behaviour, not different from anywhere else: the chauvinists, the understanding people. And when I became  somewhat successful: the envious ones.  To work with the materials I use I  had to Iteam various techniques -  like welding. The machines - designed for men - were hard to handle.  They were heavy and I needed frequent  rests. After a while though, realizing that I was serious, the school  bought new equipment which was easier  ifor me to handle.  5: Do you think there is male/female  art? Do you experience different  degrees of interest in art in the  sexes?  Mary: Art represents the reality of  an individual in a condensed, digested  form. We are trained to see art through  man's eye$ which for women is then  even farther removed frpm reality.  Women have not yet defined their own  reality. Personally though, I find  more similarities than differences  in the sexes. Unfortunately they  are both in very polarized roles.  But in spite of this, I don't feel  threatened. I believe that nowadays  it is within your own power to define  yourself.  In art you should feel the person  who stands behind it. This includes  his/her sex. This sometimes becomes  very difficult in the instances when  a writer, for example, has a deep  general insight into life, its pattern,  its aspects, but is totally hung up  on his own sex (eg. Henry Miller, J.G.  Ballard).  I think women have had to  take substandard descriptions of themselves from, otherwise universal art,  and I hope,howjthat women are beginning to get it together, we won't create  inferior images of men.  Q: What do you believe an artist's  role should be?  Mary: An artist is sort of a counterbalance - he /she can make you see  who you are, can make you aware of  the times you are living in. An artist should distill life, should project the future, should show possibilities... And since life/problems  are distilled they become clearer,  more obvious and give an opportunity  for reaction.  Q: In your exhibition you showed  more intimate relationships - "the  way we were" showing a delicately  balanced relationship (structure)  which exploded with noise when one  pushed a button,* the worry machine"  showing an American breakfast ritual  connected to a stove. The narrow  traditional role of women were opposed to/incorporated into the environmental issues.  It is hard to describe  because it was so incredibily complex.  You showed the powerstrueture of a  nuclear family and its implications.  Where are you going from here? What  are your next projects?  Mary: I am becoming interested in  finding ~« way to  express people in  larger and 4ees; well defined groups  than the family unit. For example:  work situations, travelling on a bus,  voting, belonging to a tennis club.  I will design a computer program to  operate my sculpture (in conjunction  with people). The idea is to create  elements of 'automatic' and 'manuel'  control similar to the ones operative  in forming our group identities. I  am sorry If this is a little vague  but I can hardly verbalize this next  set of sculptures at the moment.  Q: I really enjoyed your exhibition  and thank you for the interview.  -Viviane Hotz 14  north shore  news  PANEL DISCUSSION ON RAPE  On November 25, the North Shore Jay-  cees held a public"meeting on rape  at the North Shore Centennial Theatre.  The first part of the meeting was a  panel discussion on rape. The members of the panel were Staff Sgt.  Fred Bodnaruk, from the North Shore  detachment of the RCMP; Sandi, a  worker from Rape Relief; Dr. David  Hunt, a doctor at Vancouver General  Hospital Emergency Ward; and Wenda  Dean, a lawyer. The moderator was  Brian Keest.  In his talk, Sgt. Bodnaruk said that  rape has increased by ten percent and  that most rapes are accompanied by  violence. He suggested that courts  tighten up on bail for rapists. He  also said that drugs may be the cause  of the increase in violence.  Sandi,from Rape Relief, said that  rape is not just a female problem,  and that it affects all of us.  She  suggested that rape results from society saying that men are strong and  aggressive and women are passive.  She then described the role of Rape  Relief and what they do to help women who have been raped.  Dr. Hunt described the doctor's role  in rape cases. He told how rape is  determined, and talked about the --  harmful effects, both physical and  mental, on the victim.  Ms. Dean told about the court proce—  ure in rape cases. She read the description of rape from the Criminal  Code.  Then came the question period. The  questions asked were very general,  since the members of the panel had  covered everything quite thoroughly.  Sgt. Bodnaruk said there was a booklet available entitled Protection  For Girls And Women which gives some  good tips on self-defense - but, unfortunately, he didn't say where it  could be obtained.*' Some ideas on  self-defense given by the panel members were: walk in the middle of  dark streets but do try to walk on  well-lighted ones; don't walk with  you bag swinging from your shoulder  where it can be grabbed; don't hitch  hike and never alone, and don't get  into a car with more than one man;  have strong chains on your door at  home;  if you think you are in danger of being attacked get to the nearest phone.  The meeting ended with Mr. Keest  saying that a rape occured once  every twelve minutes and that everyone should get involved In fighting  this problem. The meeting was very  well organized, and I think there  should be more meetings like this.  But they would be even better if  there were demonstrations of self-  defense, or something like that.  - Fiona McQuarrie  North Shore High School  Woman  * the booklet is published by the  Vancouver Police Department,in cooperation with B.C. Tel.  REPORT ON THE "HOW TO GET  ELECTED" WORKSHOP  On Saturday, November 23, a  workshop, entitled, "How to  Get  Elected", sponsored by the  North Shore Women's Centre and  Women's Programs, Capilano  College, was held at the college. The purpose of the day  was to examine the current position of women in politics, to  discuss some of the philosophical issues surrounding women's  entry into the political arena,  and to learn something about  the pragmatics of getting  elected at the various levels  of government.  Melody Corrigal started  the day off by presenting some  depressing statistics on the  number of women in politics.  She estimated that if we continue to increase our level of .  representation in government  at the same rate as we have  done for the past six years, it  will take us 120 years to achieve 50% representation.  Rosemary Brown spoke next  on what women have to offer to  politics. Though not monolithic as a group, she felt  women bring compassion and a  different point of view to  politics; the emphasis in a  male parliament is on material and property, not on concerns with people. Among the  obstacles she identified, to  women getting elected, were  getting the nomination in a  winnable riding, lack of money,  insufficient organizational  back-up in a campaign, the lack  of other women in politics, and  the complete lack of daycare  facilities for female politicians.  The rest of the morning  was spent in workshops which examined different concepts of  power, the conflict between loy-  ality to feminism and loyality  to a political party, and the  levels of government where  change may best be achieved for  women.  In the afternoon we had a  varied and stimulating panel  presentation: Josephine Mallek,  Ann Blakey, Joan Wallace, Hilda  Thomas and Verna Barrett all  shared their individual political experiences. Joan Wallace  expressed the view that women  are afraid of politics, adding  that women would never achieve  equality until they overcome  that fear. Although women are  coming forth increasingly as  candidates unless other women  get out and work for them, they  are not going to win, she said.  Hilda Thomas pointed out that  women who come to women's conferences and meetings are not  actively supporting women candidates, as is necessary. Everyone applauded when she emphasized  the importance of women bringing  different values and goals to the .  political proces.  The rest of the afternoon was  spent looking at what is involved in obtaining office at 1) the  federal-provincial level, 2). the  municipal level, and 3) the Community Resource Board level. A  fourth workshop explored how  women can get started in politics.  Most people found these workshops  fairly informative: however,  some resource people expressed  discomfort with sharing campaign  strategies with people from other  parties and with non-feminists.  This definitely was a problem  with a workshop of this kind. Per  haps in this way it was not totally  realistic.  Overall, the day appeared to  be a success for the participants.  Of course, one day was insufficient for examining in depth all  the issues that were raised, but  it was a happy beginning. Hopefully, we will be able to hold  future similar workshops, possibly with a slightly different focus.  For those unable to attend the  workshop, we have a video-tape of  the speeches and the panel discussion.  In addition, a booklet,  summarizing the day, is being  prepared and will be available in  the new year.  -'Cathy Stewart  go in cares  From Seymour  and the Legislature  By Colin Gabelmann  MIA, North Vancouver-Seymour  There has been increasing public discussion of methods for detecting  breast cancer. Medical authorities estimate that one out of 15 women in  -British Columbia will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. This is an alarming situation but it appears methods exist which can detect breast cancer  prior to the need for radical surgery.  Two techniques exist which should be introduced in B.C. The first is  mammography which can detect cancerous tissues. The second is thermography which is a non-harmful procedure which detects increases in temperature that indicate the beginning stages of cancer!  Mammography has certain medical risks and both techniques are not  100 percent accurate. It is clear, however, from studies in New York that a  screening program using both techniques together with manual examination  can drastically reduce the incidence of breast cancer.  The process works well on women over the age of 45 and in my view  should be implemented in B.C. by the Department of Health as soon as  possible. I know the ministeWof health will seriously consider this request,  and will consider a program in the very near future.  Reprinted with permission of The Times  of North and West Vancouver, Nov.27/74 15  mail  Dear Editor,  In the December issue  of Kinesis a review of a recent  film comedy tells how a young male  reporter, still a virgin, was taken  in hand by the City Editor's wife  and improved by being seduced by  her, and states, "As a Canadian  movie, this was one of the best so  far. The comedy was actually funny."  I trust that your reviewer, and indeed your liberated  readers in general, will try to  show patience and tolerance toward elderly folk who, even today unaware of the Seventh Commandment's having been finally  abrogated by permissive enlightenment, can see in virginity, for  male and female alike, nothing  inherently ridiculous or contemptible, and who, in their senility,  can produce lines as pointless as  these:  Woman was wont to say,  you know,  "The Double Standard  has to go."  Now, getting in the  gutter, she  Can wallow to equality.  Very truly yours,  Geoffrey B. Riddehough.  Editor: Thank you for your faithful  correspondence to Kinesis (not to  mention your membership in VSW).  The  newspaper committee delights in your  letters! They, like all correspondence  we receive, are carefully read and  considered for their opinions.  We are pleased to see men in our organization who are truly interested  in our aims, especially when they  have a larger perspective of life  from having lived a bit longer than  most of our staff members.  This brings me to one of my favorite  subjects: what I see the purpose of  Kinesis to be.  It should be a forum  for all opinions which allow persons  (of either sex) to seek their best  role in life. We concentrate on  women since we are a feminist organization, but that doesn't mean we  want to be one-sided in our thinking.  It is members like you who help us  maintain our balance.  Thank you again for writing and reading us so faithfully.  Dear Friends:  I always enjoy receiving Kinesis and  immediately read it. The December  issue was particularly Interesting  to me, especially the story by Linda  Oglov (The Female Construction Worker  Ed.) Her experiences over last summer must have been very thrilling indeed.  I believe even the negative  aspects such as the cat calls and  snide remarks that were made by some  of the men could be used to show how  far off base men are at times. I  think such stories as Linda's should  be told to everyone at every opportunity.  I think those people who read  Kinesis who don't have a chance at  breaking down barriers in such a dramatic way are greatly encouraged by  reading such stories. I hope that  as more women confront the prejudice  that faces them, their stories will  also appear in Kinesis.  Gordon Marx  Dear Committee,  Enclosed my reply to your  questionnaire;  I hope it is not  too late for inclusion in your  poll.  I would be.pleased to see much  more about International Women's  Year in Kinesis. It is a United  Nations project and is intended  to increase general awareness -  by men and women - of the  inequalities existing and to  examine means of ending them.  This programme can do nothing but  assist and encourage those groups  working towards equality of  condition and opportunity for ■■  women.  As you say, there is much material  available from the Secretariat;  could you not promote interest in  your columns?  Yours sincerely,  Moyra A. Roberts  cute  Guess what!
