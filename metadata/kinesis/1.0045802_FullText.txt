  June *86 Kinesis     1  BC and Yukon  women's centres unite  by Noreen Howes  The women's movement moves  ahead in B.C. and the Yukon.  In late May, after four days  of intense deliberation, the  B.C. and Yukon Association of  Women's Centres was born at  Naramata.  The founding 36 centres represent 100,000 women from all  regions of B.C. and the Yukon.  The association will provide  a unified voice to address  the many pressing issues affecting B.C.-Yukon women today  and in the future.  Spokeswoman Jean Kavanagh from  the Victoria Status of Women  says, "While women represent  52 percent of the population,  far-reaching disparities still  exist in all facets of society,  and this is especially true of  conditions in B.C.. We will',  impress upon politicians in  our upcoming provincial election the urgency of these  inequities."  Regional representatives have  been selected to form the Association's first executive.  The 36 women centres represented at this third annual  conference were united in  their fight to remain alive  in the face of funding cuts.  There were general agreements  that this is the primary  battle, and hopes that through  an Association, strengthened  lobbying will result in less  financial insecurity.  Women at the conference were  less in agreement, however  with the fundamental definition and role of a woman's  centre. Should a centre apply  a "feminist" perspective in  its efforts to promote the  status of women? Arguing that  "feminism" is too radical a  label and would deter women  from using a centre, initially  a majority of the delegates  rejected a call to adopt this  term. After intense debate  however, which included  attempts' to define "feminism",  the term was adopted.  Another instance of political  differences among the delegates, most of whom were representing rural communities,  was whether to call the newly formed body of women centres an "association" or a  "coalition". After much argument, "coalition" was rejected as being too radical a  term. It was therefore clear  that although there were some  common ties between centres  there were also significant  political differences about  the Association's potential to  be an effective lobbying tool..  Funding permitting, one objective of the Association is  to hire a woman to maintain  connections between centres,  through continuous "networking" between the nine geographical regions. From this■  it is hoped that a strong  united front will voice common  demands. Another optimistic  sign from this founding conference was that the pressing  issues concerning women,  which demanded immediate consideration from the Association were in fact recognized  and resulted in:  Vancouver Rape Reliefs annual walkathon brought supporters of all ages to Stanley Park.  This year's fundraiser drew 160 walkers and netted $15,000 in pledges.  •a statement to the Parliamentary Task Force on childcare urging the government  to fund a universally accessible, community controlled  system;  •a letter to Secretary of  State demanding that the  Fernie, Cranbrook and Golden  women's centres receive full  funding;  •a letter to Brian Mulroney  demanding full-funding  for the Pictu Women's Centre;  •a statement to the First  Ministers' Conference in  Fairmont, BC;  •an endorsement of NAC recommendations concerning free  trade.  Video control bill tabled  The Socred government's new  Motion Picture Act, Bill 30,  tabled in the provincial legislature early this month has  drawn praise and criticism  from the community.  The new Bill, which is expected to become law by  January of 1987, introduces  a licensing system which will  mean that retailers will pay  $100 annually and submit copies of all tapes they sell or  rent to a film classification  branch of the Attorney General's  ministry. If retailers are a  caught selling illegal tapes  or tapes classified as "adult"  to minors, their licenses  could be lifted.  The Bill also enables the  Attorney General to acquire  funds from general revenues  to sponsor public education  and communication programs  on pornography.  - Local anti-pornography activist Donna Steward called the  Bill "an important first step"  and was encouraged that the  government will provide fund-  Bill 30 continued page 2  Journalists gather to 'talk shop'  Over 70 feminists from across  Canada (and one from Zaire,  Africa) representing some 25  publications were in attendance  at the second annual Canadian  Feminist Periodicals Conference held at the spacious Tai  Chi Centre in Orangeville,  Ontario in early May.  The diversity of publications  in attendance was impressive.  Present were academic journals,  rural newsletters, bilingual  publications, francophone  glossies, lesbian only papers,  literary quarterlies and journalistic newspapers. Some publications are available across  Canada, others only print  enough copies for their local  communities.  The conferences' opening panel,  which examined our role as feminist publishers, initiated  questions that participants discussed throughout the weekend.  Betty Ann Lloyd, from Nova  Scotia's Pandora,   Emma Kivisild,  former Kinesis  editor and  journalist, Celene Messner, a  Quebecois writer involved with  the journal, Canadian Women''s  Studies  and Makeda Silvera, a  collective member of Fireweed  and Sistervision discussed a  number of issues including the  role of feminist periodicals,  self censorship, race and class.  According to Lloyd, "the process  of getting Pandora  out every  three months and onto the  street is a political act."  Lloyd added that "the role of  the feminist press is to carry  the individual voice of women's  experience."  Emma Kivisild told degagates  that feminist periodicals have  to recognize double and triple  oppression (of race and class). .  "An issue", said Kivisild,  does not have to affect exclusively women in order to be a  women's issue."  Makeda Silvera, in addressing  self-censorship, asked participants to examinie how they  make decisions "in what we  publish and what we don't publish."  Celine Messner called on delegates to consider formalizing  into a national association  of feminist periodicals.  Throughout the weekend a variety of workshops were offered  including leadership dilemmas,  working with volunteers, politics of design, race and  class, lesbian visibility,  fundraising—and many more.  Perhaps because of the diversity of publications present  and their respective workloads,  few concrete proposals came out  of the conference. Despite this  most participants thought  the gathering was very successful as it provided feminist  publishers with the rare opportunity to "talk shop" with  women from across the country.  Participants did agree that all  papers that could would publish  a pro-lesbian article in their  October editions. This measure  was seen as an effort to  counter rising attacks on lesbians and lesbian rights. 0ct<-  ober was choosen because the  first Saturday in October is  traditionally lesbian pride >  day in Quebec.  An area which received a lot of  attention was the relationship  of the feminist press to the  feminist movement. While many  at the conference believed a  strong feminist press was  vital to the .movement there was  considerable ambivalence about  just exactly what that relationship consists of. Does the  movement expect unquestioning  loyalty and when its press  is critical, how do feminist  papers deal with reaction from  the movement?  Many papers, as is common with  other women's groups, have  major concerns about government funding—will it last and  how does it affect editorial  freedom? Most participants  agreed that eventually the  government will stop funding  papers and that the fundamental question facing all feminist periodicals is when the  funding is gone, the paid  staffers are gone, the telephone, typewriters and waxer  is gone...where will the  women's movement periodicals  be? \B?

Stewart's support for the Bill is in  keeping with calls from a number of wo-  • men's groups, including the Vancouver  .^Council of WOmen and the North Shore  Women's Centre, who have urged the province to introduce standards for video  UpVBsification (see Kinesis  Dec./Jan.  1985-86).  Other groups and individuals, however,  are strongly critical of the bill and  have organized a coalition, the Coalition for the Right to View (CRTV) to  fight against the Bill.  According to the CRTV the Bill is not  a classification system but rather is  censorship. According to a CRTV press  conference the bill will give "sweeping powers to the Director (of the  classification board) and to the Cabinet  to define sexuality, suggestive or ex-  licit, and to change the criteria for  what is to be classifed and censored."  The CRTV, whose members include many  artists and artist centres, bookstores,  publishers, galleries and the Emily Carr  College faculty among others, also points  out that the Bill provides no exemptions  for artists and complain that artists  could not carry the costs of submitting  tapes to be pre-screened by a classification board.  Kinesis plans retreat  During our summer break Kinesis  will  take some time, away from the stresses  of copy deadlines and production, to  examine the paper's strengths and weaknesses.  We anticipate important changes in  Kinesis  in the forthcoming year. We are  considering changes in the papers design,  its production cycle, its editorial emphasis and direction and its administrative  needs.  We are inviting women who have worked on  Kinesis  in the past, are working presently  or are considering getting involved to come  to a Kinesis  retreat and.take a broad look  at, our future directions and goals.  We have scheduled a weekend (dates below)  where there will be time for both work and  relaxation, as we assess where we will be  going in the future. Transportation and some  food costs will be covered by Kinesis.  If you are interested in being involved in  this process please call us for more details  We believe Kinesis  provides an exciting and  rewarding work for political activists. The  weekend retreat will feature some provocative discussions on the role of the feminist press and our relationship to the feminist movement. Come and join us.

Inside, spectators and supporters awaited our entrance.  When we did appear, they made  lots of noise.  As members of the Vancouver  women's soccer team which  travelled to San Francisco is  1982 to participate in the  first gay Olympics, we helped  to make history.  History will repeat itself  this year when Gay Games II -  Triumph in '86 kicks off August 9. Lotus Kaze will be  there with boots on.  Lotus Kaze, formerly the East  Enders, is the only all-les-i  bian team registered in the  Metro Vancouver Women's Soccer  League. Founded more than six  years ago by current coaches  Luce Roberts and Corrine Hunt,  the team comprises women who  share the pair's concept of  a competitive, non-sexist,  female-run crew.  "We started the team for the  fun of it," Roberts recalled  in an interview, explaining  that the intent was to pro  vide an alternative for wom-  men who wanted to play soccer, but were uncomfortable  with conventional league  teams traditionally coached  by men.  When it appeared last.year  that the team might dissolve  Roberts decided to. head a revival of oldtimers, with a  focus on Gay Games II.  One week of festivities are  slated with competition in  18 sports sandwiched between  opening and closing ceremonies. Having competed in Gay  Games I, Roberts looks forward to the return trip.  Meanwhile, there is the regular season to contend with.  Two games in, the team is  boasting a one-and-one record  in the league's third 'divi*  sion. There also are fundraisers planned to pad the team's  travel account.  To date, their have been music  nights hosted at the Lotus Hotel, which sponsors Lotus Kaze,  as well as a buffet brunch.  The next event on the agenda  is scheduled for June 27; women and guests are invited to  join team members for a night  of dancing, raffles and prize  draws. The $1 cover charge  will go toward our Triumph in  A lesbian in Terrace, BC has  quietly fought since last  autumn to get her employer's  medical plan, which extends  coverage to common-in-law  spouses to include her partner.  Elizabeth Snyder, a college  instructor, decided to seek  the benefits after her BC  Government Employees Union  local was successful last fall  ' in getting a human rights  clause into the local collective agreement. At the same  time Snyder became eligible  for medical benefits, and after reading about a similar  case in Toronto which was successful, decided to include  the name of her partner of  three years, Maureen Bostock,  on the application form.  Early decisions in the case  have gone against her so far  and arbitration is likely the  next step.  Snyder and Bostock live openly in the northwestern BC municipality of Usk (population  <40) outside Terrace. They are  founders of the icoal organization "Northern Lesbians",  and together they edit The  Open Door,   a quarterly publi  cation for rural lesbians. "I  knew when I moved to Terrace  (in 1982) I'd either be very  out or completely closeted,"  Snyder says.  A union representative told  Snyder that he had her in -  mind when sexual orientation  was included in a human-rights  clause in the college instructor's collective agreement.  The clause states there will  be no discrimination, interference, or restriction practiced with respect to any employee in the matter of hiring, discharge or otherwise  on numerous grounds, including sexual orientation.  Snyder said the decision to  seek medical benefits for  Bostock "was easy because  once I saw the clause I knew  the time was right. I'm ready  to do it and it's time to  start fighting."  Snyder would like to hear from  people—particularly thsoe  who have fought similar battles or are considering it—  to share strategies, information and support. Snyder can  be contacted by writing her  c/o Northern Lesbians, RR2,  Box 50, Usk Store, Terrace,  BC, V8G 3Z9-  Trade union backs lesbian  fighting for spousal rights  Paternity Act upheld  by Barbara Findlay  The BC Court of Appeal has  upheld the law giving BC women the right to seek a declaration of paternity, and  maintenance, from the father  of a child born outside marriage .  Jerry Ricard, who was sued  for maintenance as the bio1-)  logical father of such a  child, had argued that the  Child Paternity and Support  Act was now invalid because  it allowed an unmarried mother to bring an action against  the biological father, but |  did not give the same right  to an unmarried father supporting a child born outside  marriage to sue the mother.  Ricard challenged the Act under the year-old Section 15  of the Charter of Rights,  which says "Every individual  is equal before and under the  law and has the right to the  equal protection and equal  benefit of the law without  discrimination, and, in particular, without discrimination based on...sex."  Vancouver Status of Women intervened in the appeal, along  with the BG Association of  Social Workers, BC Civil Liberties Association, Federated  Anti-Poverty Groups of BC, and  West Coast LEAF Association.  The interveners argued that.,  although the Act was discriminatory, because it treated  men and women differently,' it  should not be held invalid,  but instead should be extended .by the clurt to cover an  unwed father seeking child  maintenance from the mother.  The majority of the Court of  Appeal held that the law did  discriminate, because it provided an enforcement machinery to women unvavilable to  men. But the Court held that  the broad public purpose of  the legislation was to establish paternity. Because the  Act was not arbitrary, irrational, or unfair in achieving that purpose-, it was justified even though it was discriminatory. The court therefore upheld the legislation  under Section 1 of the Charter which provides that a  Charter right can be infringed if it is "demonstrably justified in a free and  democatic society".  VLC  Creating community jobs  Vancouver Lesbian Connection  (VLC) is a group of eight lesbians who formed a collective  in April 1984 to provide a  lesbian social and political  organizing space that is supported by the lesbian community and run by the groups  that use it. The VLC wishes  to foster lesbian visibility,  education, support, and political action.  In September 1985, through  their own efforts and with a  lot of help from other members  of the community, the collective opened Canada's only lesbian centre operating on a  daily basis.  As part of VLC's long-range  vision of being self-supporting, the group applied for and  received $45,000 from the Job  Development Program of Canada  Employment and Immigration Commission. They have hired two  women for one year to investigate and develop a business  that would help, -support the  centre.  The format and goals of the  VLC's Community Economic De  velopment project will provide  a framework for forming a socially responsible women's cooperative business.  The VLC hopes that with a  business that provides access  to skill development, economic  support for political activists, provisions for childcare  and worker control; they will  provide a collective solution  to the problems of chronic unemployment, dissatisfaction  with traditional workplaces,  and constant efforts to seek  government funding.  The VLC collective aims to  perfect a business that, ideally, would provide: reliable  employment for women, high  enough wages so that women  could work flexible hours including paid time for political work, reasonable childcare, skill development and  training, and finally be socially responsible and useful.

Kinesis  interviewed her on her recent visit  to Vancouver. p^j&Z  Are there anti-choice demonstrations happening at the clinic now?  Rebick: There are demonstrations pretty  well every day but they've really died down  in the last .six months or so. There's usually three or four people out there all  day and then at lunch time it might go up  to twelve. And they are much less vicious  than they were last summer. They're a lot  more demoralized now because the clinic  has been open so long. They're not as energetic in their attempts to harass the women, but they're still there.  Do you think the anti-choice movement is  actually getting weaker?  Rebick: It definitely is. It's upsetting  that they are there at all but there really  are fewer people. In the summer it was just  incredible; they were playing "Happy Birthday to your dead baby" tapes, and showing  A Silent Scream  continuously in the window  of the cafe they rent next door to the  clinic. They're still showing the movie,  but nobody stops to watch it.  What kind of effect do the anti-choice demonstrators have on the public?  Rebick: I think people are disgusted by  them. The support for pro-choice has never  been stronger and I think there are a number of ways.of seeing that. In Ontario's  most recent fight against extra-billing for  The clinic is still open and women  are getting the services they need  medicare, for example, doctors resigned from  the therapeutic abortion committee in Sarnia  to protest the government's intention to  ban extra-billing. We called a press conference, with the National Action Council on  the Status of Women (NAC) and said, we were  going to organize opposition to the doctors  because of this resignation. We formed an  alliance which is the broadest'' alliance  that's ever been formed in Ontario history.  I'm one of the main spokespeople of the alliance — for O.C.A.C. — and nobody objects to that. Abortion is one of the central issues in the alliance; access to abortion as a rejection of extra-billing. The  popular understanding in Ontario is that  the reasons the group mobilized against  doctors was because they resigned from the  therapeutic abortion committee.  Today the Ontario Medical Association (OMA.)  is saying "if we go on strike, we're going  •to maintain emergency services and abortion  services ." I think that if you sit there and  look outside the clinic it's depressing but  the fact is the clinic is still open and  women are getting the services they need.  Two years ago no one, including us, ever  thought we'd be able to stay open. You have  to get beyond the pickets out there and  look at the longer term. Overall we're doing very well.  What .support is the clinic receiving from  feminists in Toronto, particularly at present,  since the changeover from support demos  in front of the clinic to anti-choice demos?  How are feminists responding?  I think over the last few years there's  been tremendous support from the feminist  community. In 1983 we had support demos but  we were a much smaller movement with much  smaller support. We've changed our tactics  mainly because the doctors at the clinic  didn't want pickets in front of the clinic.  Women who are coming from out of town don't  know whether you're pro-choice or anti-  choice. They just see huge numbers of people that they have to get through. We started to organize demos at Queen's Park instead  where we had as many as ten thousand people  attend. That was much more powerful.  Is it a conscious strategy of OCAC not to  respond to the pickets?  Yes. From the beginning of the struggle we  felt that it would be a mistake to confront  the right-to-life as' the enemy because we  always felt that the enemy was the government. It was the government that was denying women access to abortions, not the  right to life movement.  But was the government being convinced by  the right to life?  I don't think so. I think that they just  used the right to lifers. The government  tried to say that there are two extreme factions in this fight, and that they're the  moderates in the middle. They never say  that anymore because we've presented ourselves as spokespeople for the women. We  felt that confrontations in front of the  clinic would feed into the image the government was trying to create of these two  lunatic factions fighting each other. The  main concern was the women, that it was no  good for the women who are using the clinic,  Our supporters are actually more numerous  than the right to lifers'. Pro-choice women  work as escorts for the women. That was a  much more positive thing to do than picket-  ting outside. There are some escorts now  but since there's less harassment, escorts  aren't as necessary. Escort service was less  visible than pickets but there were more  women involved. That was the way the pro-  choice women showed support which was more  effective emotionally.  Can you comment on the recent precedent-  setting court decision which acquitted of  trespassing charges an anti-choice demonstrator who padlocked himself to the clinic?  We were very angry about that but it wasn't  a shock. I don't expect much from the judicial system. He did it again and we'll see  what happens in the court this time. But  they're flying in the face of the judge,  who warned them not to do it again. It's  only this one guy who does it, and he keeps  . doing it over and over again and getting  busted. We did do a thing where after he  was acquitted he came back to the clinic  and padlocked it and held a press conference. Well we were there; we padlocked open  the gate.  The thing is, you could waste all your energy in little skirmishes and what's the points  It doesn't get us anywhere but it makes us  feel good because you kinda hit at them a  bit. But we're in a difficult position, we  protested that but we prefer not to pay too  much attention to them. This is a fanatical  little group and they've gotten way too much  coverage already. They still get too much  coverage; now they've picked a new gimmick  which is to picket staff people's houses.  This is getting press coverage because it's  What's happening across Canada; will new  clinics be opening up; what other things  is the pro-choice movement doing?  We're hopeful that following the Supreme  Court decision we'll be in a position to  open a couple of clinics at least somewhere  in the country. Not sure where yet. And  hopefully they won't be Morganthaler clinics,  they'll be clinics opened by women's organizations and staffed by doctors. That's what  we're looking for. We've got a few doctors  now who are willing to do it, or at least  appear to be willing.  The thing is, you could waste all  your energy in little skirmishes  and what's the point?  The big things happening across Canada now  are the "Speak Out For Choice" tribunals.  The problem with the clinic strategy was  that it was too provincially oriented and  too localized. We needed to build more of  a cross-country movement. We decided to  start tribunals which we've now had in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto — and  we'll be having them in Halifax, PEI and  Quebec. This is the first time there's been  a successful coordinated across-Canada action. We're also planning some kind of culmination in Ottawa in the fall. We'll make  a final decision in a couple of weeks as to  whether we're going to organize a major  march.  The other important development is the pro-  choice coalition that's formed in Quebec.  Over 100 groups formed in response to the  threats from the government to stop community clinics from doing abortions. It's  a huge coalition; people from groups in'  every part of the province; all three labour federations and every women's group.  It's quite significant that as a result  the Bourassa government has backed down.  •Now-they're interested~in working with  us to repeal the federal laws so that's  really exciting too.  What 's happening at the clinic in  Winnipeg?  That's where there's been a real defeat;  I think we have to admit this without question. The clinic is only open as a referral  centre. There's been no abortions performed  Rebick continued page 23 June '86 Kinesis  ACROSS CANADA  Bashing high school homophobia  by Nancy Pollak  The determination—and  courage—of lesbian and gay  highschool students and an  outstanding school trustee  have resulted in the Toronto  School Board approving measures to help end homophobia  in the school system.  Although the gains of this  decision have yet to be realized, the fact of its  approval represents a major  victory for the students,  parents and activists who  participated in the campaign.  The School Board was responding to recommendations put  forward by the School Programs  Committee which had gained a  forceful.new member in last  November's election. Trustee  Olivia Chow had requested a  report on discrimination  faced by lesbian and gay  students and had discovered  that nothing was being done  in this area. Olivia then  met with Lesbian and Gay  Youth Toronto, and based  on their testimony of abuse and  and harassment, drafted a  series of proposals.  Students, gay and straight  parents, lawyers from Justice  for Children and the Civil  Liberties Section of the  Ontario Bar Association as  well as social workers  appeared before the Committee  with statements in support  of the proposals. Opposition  was surprisingly weak (a  speaker from Catholic Action  For Life confessed that his  group had 8 members). The  school programs committee  approved of the recommendations passed (see box).  When the matter went before  the entire Board, all but  the no-discrimination  clause received approval,  with the proviso that the  materials and programs  developed be circulated to  school communities for consideration.  The failure of the Board to  affirm the no-discrimination  clause was a setback attributable to the right-wing  members of the Board .(the  Toronto School Board has  10 NDP trustees who supported  the motion). Yet the Board's  willingness to acknowledge  and deal with homophobia among  students and staff is a  striking turn-around to events  five years ago when similar  attempts by a Gay Liason Com  mittee were viciously attached  and rejected.  Analysts believe that several  factors contributed to a more  favourable climate. The  murder last summer of gay  teacher Kenneth Zeller by  five male students who admitted they were "queer bashing"  had a profound effect on trustees. As well, the Federal  Justice minister's apparent  intention to include sexual  orientation in the Canadian  Human Rights Code was influential. But most importantly, the insistence of gay and  lesbian students that homophobia is an evil that can  and must be erased, along with  support from sympathetic  trustees and parents, carried  the day.  Recommendations which  •development of curriculum dealing with sexual orientation  •programs to sensitize students  to the human rights of homosexuals  •cooperation with the Teachers'  Federation for in-service  training for teacher's on the  issue  •development of administrative  mechanisms to ensure the above  really happens  Recommendations defeated:  •new policy that would prohibit  discrimination on the basis  of sexual orientation  Harassment case a dangerous first?  A decision by a Manitoba  board of adjudication will  weaken women's defenses  against sexual harassment,  says a Canadian human rights  newsletter.  The Canadian Human Rights  Advocate says two Manitoba  women suffered "deep and  leasting humiliation" at the  hands of their employer yet  were awarded only 300 and  600 dollars respectively by  the Board of Adjudication."  The two women, Corrington and  Ostifichuk, without knowing  each other, filed separate  complaints of sexual harassment for the same job.  According to the Advocate,  Margaret Corrigan was hired  as a receptionist-typist by  C.A.M. Janitorial Ltd., where  she was sexually harassed by  her supervisor Tony Valente.  She refused his advances and  one and a half days after she  was hired she came to work  and found that Valente had  hired someone else for the  job.  Ostifichuk was hired four  months later for the same  job. She says company owner  Celso Figuiredo propositioned  her and harassed her when she ;  refused his advances. Figueir-  do was quoted as saying to  her "I can do anything I want,  I'm the boss."  Chairman of the Board of  Ajudication Steel ruled that  Figueiredo and Valento sexually harassed the two female  employees and that the company was libel for their conduct.  The Contemporary Saga of Little Mellon  fc^MS^  bp^  11  rhJu  (K®F.'"  0*  ^tS5  Steel awarded Ostifuchuk  $600 for loss of self-respect.  Steel noted that Corrington's  feelings of humiliation and  anger were still evident at  the hearing more than a year  after the incident and awarded her $300 for her hurt  feelings.  According to the Advocate,  the decision is a trivial-  ization of current sexual  harassment laws. It notes  that Corrington was compensated for one week of work  lost because her employer  did not give her proper notice  ihnoring the fact that she  was fired on illegal grounds.  Also the women were not compensated for wages lost from  being forced out of full-time  work or days given up to testify in court. The newsletter  also denounces the small  compensations awarded for  damage to the women's self-  respect.  The Advocate alerts Manitoba  feminists to the dangerous  precedent set by the decision  and closed its appeal with  these comments:  "Sexual harassment is a widespread and serious social  problem. Women who are the  poorest and the least privileged are the most are the  most vulnerable—women who  have little financial resources to fall back on if fired  for refusing sexual favours,  women who work at poverty level  wages In non-unionized jobs  at $4 an hour, immigrant women,  minority group women, native  Indian women and women in  their first jobs."  The fitht for equality rights  has always been not only in  the courts, but also in the  public and political spheres.  Women who disagree with the  way protection against sexual  harassment has been trivialized in Manitoba, should raise  their voices and demand that  legislators and judges deal  with sexual harassment as a  serious harm which they will  no longer tolerate in Canadian society." 6     Kinesis June '86  INTERNATIONAL  Nicarguans kindle abortion debate  by Nancy Pollak  "A woman who has an abortion  can be sentenced to one to  four years in prison. But if  a man beats his wife and she  has a miscarriage, he faces  only six months to two years  in prison." The speaker is  Maria Lourdes, a member of  the Nicaraguan women's association, AMNLAE. Hers is one  of the many voices being  raised during a public debating of the abortion issues that  started in Nicaragua last  November. It is a debate that  reveals something of the complexity of Nicaraguan society—  and its revolution.  Abortion is a crime in Nicaragua, a fact which translates  into hundreds of women dying  each year from illegal abortions. The law—left over from  the Somoza era—does provide for "therapeutic" abortions via a complicated process involving the approval  of a doctors' committee and  the women's husband or parents. Wealthy women evade  this route by having illegal  abortions in private clinics;  working-class women take their  chances in the back alley.  Also at issue are laws regulating sterilization. At present,  women require their husband's  permission before being sterilized.  Barricada,  the newspaper of  the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) has run a  series of articles outlining  the problem, many of which supported women's fundamental right  to control their bodies. These  articles provoked a sharp response from the catholic church  hierarchy which, speaking through  the right-wing newspaper La  Prensa,   denounced abortion as  murder.  Even within the progressive circles of the women's and Sandin  ista movements there is a range  of opinion. Some women believe  that, rather than legalizing ■  abortion, social services such  as housing and childcare should  be expanded. Others say that  because so many young people have  died—and continue to die—in  the liberation war, Nicaraguan  women can support the revolution  by having more children. To date,  the national executive committee  of AMNLAE has yet to issue a public statement on abortion. ■  Yet there are strong pro-choice  voices in the FSLN. Doris Tijer-  ino, head of the national police  force, is firmly behind decriminalizing abortion stating that  "the current law restricts the  civil rights of a woman by denying her the right to freely determine maternity." But she  cautions that it would be inappropriate to force a new law  on the people. "There should be  a campaign to get women to reject  the prejudices and accept legalization." Doris Tijerino recognizes that, without a wide-ranging discussion among women, no.  real change will occur. Despite  opposition from some formidable  quarters, that discussion is now  underway.  Information for international  stories for this issue were  taken from Broadsheet, Spare  Rib,   Off Our Backs,  Socialist  Voice and Sojourner.  NZ women policy setters  by Nancy Pollak  Every three years the women of  New Zealand's ruling Labour  Party come together to air  their concerns and write policy  —policy that has a better than  average chance of being accepted by the party as a whole.  This February, 300 women met in  Wellington and, in workshops  and plenaries, delt with issues ranging from domestic violence to the rights of Maori  and Pacific Island women.  Maori women had a powerful presence throughout the conference, and numerous recommendations were issued from their  workshop, including: affirmative action to improve the image of Maori women in the media; a call for more Maori women to be appointed to government boards and bodies; research into the economic and  social status of Maori women;  and police training in Maori  culture.  Women of the Pacific Islands  were also in attendance and  their demands were accepted by  the plenary (Pacific Island women come from the small islands  neighbouring New Zealand; they  suffer discrimination as immi  grants, women of colour and  workers within New Zealand society). Issues that concerned  them included: the teaching of  Pacific Island languages and  culture at all levels of the  education system; more housing  for large families; and the  need for more Pacific Island  women in the police force and  judiciary.  For the first time in conference history pornography received attention. Women Against  Pornography delivered a presentation and the workshop that  followed developed policy including a proposal that any authority assessing material must  be representative of the gender,  race and sexual preference of  characters degraded by the material .  Economic and labour issues were  also addressed with women showing a willingness to go beyond  general concerns. For example,  the Labour Department was  called upon to actually enforce  existing legislation that protects outworkers (the New Zealand term for women who- do  piecework in the home).  Camden lesbians  win right to  open Centre  by Nancy Pollak  Lesbians in the London Borough  of Camden have won planning  permission to open a Lesbian  Centre, but not without fierce  opposition from some of their  neighbours. Members of a local  tenants' association lobbied  hard against the request to  Borough Council to convert a  disused storefront into a gathering spot for Camden lesbians.  Charges of child molestation,  moral dangers and general community disintegration were  tossed about during a tempest  tuous Council session, and some  of the upright citizens promised to greet any such Centre  with gasoline bombs.  The Chair of Camden Council  Women's Committee is facing  police investigation for  criminal libel from having  disclosed the threat of gasoline bombs in a letter to  the London Standard.  The Council did rather grudgingly grant permission for  the Center, but lesbians in  Camden are preparing for a  difficult — and possibly  dangerous — summer ahead.

"I gave the Centre library a  copy of Regumi Tsushin  (a Japanese lesbian publication)  and said please put this where  everyong can see it, and by  the way why don't you pay  3,000 yen and receive it regularly." "I'm going to take  back the image of the blue  handkerchief that came round  the circle to me when I started to cry." "I'm going to tell  all the foreigners out there  who say you can't really be  friends with Japanese people  that the Japanese women here  are truly my friends." "I'm  not going to smile when I  don't want to."  These were just a few replies  to the question "How are you  going to take the energy of  this weekend back into your  life in the straight world to  change it for the better?"  The question was posed in the  closing circle of'the Third  Lesbian Weekend, which was  held outside Tokyo, May 2nd-  5th. Sixty lesbians participated, half Japanese and half  foreigners, the latter being  mainly Americans with a few  Australians and Brits and one  New Zealander.  From Friday evening till Monday lunchtime we laughed,  cried, danced, sang, ate,  drank, studied and played,  but mainly we revelled in our  lesbianism and the wonder of  being together. While those  of us who live in Tokyo are  isolated, the women who live  in the smaller cities and  country areas sometimes don't  see another lesbian during  the three months between weekends. Add to this the near-im-  possibility of Japanese women  being out lesbians and still  keeping their jobs and  friends, and you'll begin to  understand just how precious  our weekends are.  Generally the weekend was  quite unstructured, and  there was plenty of time for  tennis or just lying around -  even the Sunday afternoon  self-defence workshop was  held outside in the sun.  There were also workshops and  discussion groups, and while  these were mainly in Japanese  or  English, a couple were bilingual. •  Topics included: Rewriting  our Lesbian Herstories; the  words we use to express ourselves; Co-counselling, lesbians freeing ourselves from  internalised oppression, what  kind of lesbians do we want  to be; and The Lone Women  Bicyclists and Escape Artists  Network. A workshop on masturbation was based on a ques-  tionaire which was collected  at breakfast on Sunday and  the findings distributed at  lunchtime the same day. Such  efficiencey took our breath  away, not to mention finding  that your own peculiar little  habits were shared by ten other women!  There was also a report from  the Geneva International Lesbian Conference by a woman  who'd just returned and was  dying to share her experiences. Regumi Tsushin,   the  Japanese lesbian newsletter,  distributed its May issue,  which was printed with a  great deal of hassle and exasperation for the collective.  And the first issue of an English language lesbian newsletter was distributed to all  the participants.* We had a  concert by our favourite duo  and their backing group, and  this was followed by an uproarious dance.  As usual we held the weekend  at the National Women's Education Centre in Saitama.**  And as usual we had minor  rule-breaking disagreements  with the "authorities" (rthe  centre staff). This time it  was about women wandering out  of the centre grounds while  workshops were in progress.  We managed to change it from  a definite "no" to "OK if you  sign yourself in and out and  your 'leader' says you may,"  but actually they'd much prefer to keep us caged from arrival to departure.  Although we still have to  call ourselves "Toyko International Women's Group", and  use dyke or women-loving-women on our posters (the word  Lesbian being not nice, in the  estimation of the authorities,  having pornographic connotations! ) we're pretty much an  accepted phenomenon. We're  one of the most regular users,  and they know by now it's not  a case of "ignore them and maybe they'll go away!'. Lesbian  weekends are here to stay,  and the Saitama Centre is the  perfect place to hold them.  Judging from the feedback  sheets nearly every woman had  a really wonderful time.  There's no doubt that we're  learning how to be together,  and so the weekends are getting better and better. As I  heard one woman point out,  !'For the first weekend we  planned a Japanese conference  and a foreigners conference,  and then we put them together.  This time we're all more comfortable with each other, and  we even have just one schedule, written in both Japanese  and English."  The next Lesbian Weekend will  be in the Autumn. As I left  the centre I saw a little knot  of women at the reception desk  making our reservations, and  for me the knowledge that it  will happen again is the most  empowering thing I took away  with me.  *If you'd like to receive a  copy of the English language  Japanese lesbian newsletter,  send $2 to: Amanda Hayman,  Kamirenjaku 2-15-19, Mitaka-  shi, Tokyo 181, Japan.

It is a large sleek m  multi-storied, concrete complex set in enormous, well-  tended grounds, which was  built by the Japanese government at the beginning of the  UN Decade of Women,  in an effort to be seen to be contributing. Being government run  it bears  no resemblance to women's centres in the west.  Apart from its size it is  staffed by both women and men,  there are numerous restrictions about times and places  and cans and can 'ts, and men  who want to stay there are  made most welcome. Anyone who  wants to study anything related to women 's education can  use the centre.  USA  Supreme Court quashes anti-porn bylaw  by Nancy Pollak  The efforts of American feminists Andrea Dworkin and  Catharine MacKinnon to deal  with pornography as a civil  rights issue 'have been dealt  a serious blow by the U.S.  Supreme Court. On February  24-th, the Court ruled unconstitutional an Indianapolis  ordinance based on Dworkin-  MacKinnon's model in which  women were entitled to sue  for damages done to them by  pornography. The judges voted  against hearing any oral arguments on the case and summarily, affirmed a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Court of  Appeals'in Chicago which had_  overturned the ordinance on  the grounds that it violated  the constitutional guarantee  of free speech. The act of  "affirming" this decision  makes the ruling national  in scope (as compared to particular to this ordinance).  Indianapolis city council had  approved the ordinance in 1984. '  (A similar by-law had passed  in Minneapolis but was later  vetoed by the mayor.) The law  defined pornography as "the  graphic depiction of wcmien,  whether in pictures or words,  if such depiction shows women as  as sexual objects who enjoy  pain, humiliation or rape; are  bound, mutilated, dismembered or  ALL GOVERNMENTS  LIE....  I  I'M  SICK OF IT  m  Sick of lies  m  TROUBLE   IS...  •   1  I'M ALSO....  *  Sick of the  TRUTH....  m  ■  tortured; in pictures or  servility, submission or display; or are penetrated by  objects or animals." The use  of men, children or transexuals  in such depictions was also  banned.  American feminists have been  badly divided over the'iuse  of such ordinances as a means  of combatting our oppression,  and reactions to the ruling  reflected these differences.  Supporters of the ordinance  viewed the Court's decision as  proof that the legal system  considers the rights of  pornographers more important  than those of women. MacKinnon  maintained that the ordinance  was constitutional and that  the Court's ruling "cannot be  squared with any good faith  reading of prior law." She  plans to continue to campaign  around the concept of pornography as a civil rights violation.  Feminist opponents of the ordinance were pleased. Nan Hunter  of FACT (feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce) said that the  women's movement now "won't have  to continue a debate on this  particular proposal...it (the  ruling) gives us an opportunity  to unite in opposition to the  ' Meese Commission proposals."  The Meese Commission is a federal study which will report  ■ its .findings on pornography this  summer; FACT is anticipating  that it will make repressive  recommendations. HEALTH  PID Society forms  by Karen Gram  Mari Wright spends 22 hours of every  day in bed. She endures a constant  and sharp pain in her abdomen that  feels like her reproductive organs  are being rubbed with ground glass.  She tires very easily, even just from  talking. Sometimes it hurts too much  to speak. She's been treated by every  anti-biotic on the market. Doctors  have suggested it's all in her head.  Mari has pelvic inflammatory disease  (PID). She is 37  years old and she's  been sick for ten years, ever since  her daughter was four. PID is a disease in which a woman's reproductive  organs become infected and inflamed.  The inflammation can block her tubes,  causing infertility or abscesses,  intense pain and sometimes death.  For Mari, the pain is much worse  than a labour pain.  Although some doctors consider PID  epidemic in Canada, it is not a high  profile disease. Nor is it a high  priority for research. According to  Health and Welfare statistics, 140,000  women were treated in hospitals for it  in 1982. The disease is much more widespread than that however. Only 10-15  percent of all PID victims are hospitalized.  The Centre of Disease Control in the  US estimates one in four women will  have PID by the year 2000. The Canadian  PID Society, of which Mori is a board  member, formed to provide support for  victims and increase awareness. It  states that no major research, on PID  is being conducted in Canada. Few  women have ever -heard of it. A 15  year old Vancouver woman died of PID  last year. Over 900 American women die  of it each year because they have no  medical coverage. Young women between  15 and 19 are most susceptible but all  women are at risk.  Diane Belanger was 19 when she was told  she had gonorrhea—two months after  she had noticed a change in her discharge and had it checked at the hospital. She was treated but a few  months later, she was bothered by what  felt like bubbles in her stomach and  constipation.  "I kind of procrastinated about going  to the doctor. It didn't hurt too much  but then I got really constipated and  I could feel a pain in what I thought  was my ovary," said Diane.  "The doctor said I was just constipated  and that my ovary wasn't where I  thought it was. He gave me pills for  constipation."  What followed was a year of going in  and out of doctors' offices and hospitals with fevers and intense abdominal pain. Not once did any doctor  mention or diagnose PID although it  was clear that was her problem.  At one point during, a summer camping  trip to the States, Diane got really  severe pains and abdominal swellings so  she drove nine hours back to Canada,  but was turned away from a hospital in  Montreal dispite a memo from a doctor  she had seen in the US explaining the  possibile severity of her condition.  The doctor in Montreal told her she  didn't need to be examined because  she had seen the American doctor just  nine hours before.  "I argued with her and she-finally  examined me. She said I had an infection because I didn't wear panties.','  The doctor also told her she.would  have to go to the hospital in her  home town of Hull, Quebec.for treat- foment because her hosptial was full.  Diane made it as far as Ottawa two  hours later where she was admitted to the  hospital.  "I was there for a week on intravenus  and oral antibiotics. When they let me  out they told me to rest but they didn't  really explain how important rest was.  They never told me I couldn't have sex.  Rest to me was not going to work."  Maureen Moore, president of the Canadian  PID Society and herself a PID patient,  says rest is crucial to recovery.  Diane returned to hospital the following  winter with more pain. She had an abscess  on her right ovary drained. A few.months  later the pain and bubbles returned and  she finally had her right ovary and tube  removed. "I still didn't know I had PID,"  she said.  That September she moved to Vancouver.  She was still having pain. It wasn't  too'bad but it could be quite sharp  around her left ovary. Her Vancouver  doctor was the first physician to examine her and recognize PID. She told  Diane.  "In a way I was releived. At least then  I knew I had something."  Before her period Diane still has pain in  her ovary, sometimes extending down her  leg, but she can still lead a normal  life.  "I think I'm lucky when I read about  other women."  "The moral of this stqry is that doctors  are so incompetent. Part of it was me  not doing what I was supposed to do because the doctors hadn't told me how important it was."  Anne Lidstone, the coordinator of the  PID Society, says the biggest problem  with PID is that it is hard to recognize.  "If you cut your finger and it gets  infected., you know because it hurts. But  when you have an infection in your uterus and tubes you don't always know because  our nerves aren't as sensitive there.  If they were, pregnancy would be nine  months of agony. You don't always have  the telltale signs that point to where  the infection is. It could be a dull  ache or a pain in the leg. Sometimes it's  just a difference in your menstrual cycle.  If there are signs however they usually  show up within a week of having your  period.  There are several causes of PID. The most  common is through sexually transmitted  diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.  The VD bacteria creeps up the vagina  past a dilated cervix and into the uterus  where it causes infections.  Another common cause is the use of IUDs  for birth control. The tail of the IUD  acts as a link between the vagina, where  many bacteria congregate, and the sterile uterus. It can also occur because of  the very nature of IUD birth control. The  IUD causes inflammation of the uterus and  tubes to prevent the fertilized egg from  implanting in the uterus. An IUD caused  Mari's illness.  Anne Lidstone says doctors have a hard  time spotting PID because the tests are  not alwasy accurate or because the doctor  tests the cervix and. not the uterus. The  tests might not show the bacteria because  the woman may have bathed or douched before visiting the doctor. That could wipe  the bacteria off the cervix.  Lidstone warns women who suspect PID  not to douche before visiting the  >>*-  doctor and never forcefully douche because  that will push bacteria up to the uterus.  She says the best test for PID is a lapa-  roscopy, a simple surgical examination  of the reproductive organs. Although  formost authorities on PID recommend  this procedure, few North American  doctors do it because of the expense  and the need to hospitalize the patient, says Lidstone.  Women should ask their doctors to  routinely test them for chlamydia as  well. Until six months ago, B.C. laboratories didn't analyze chlamydia  although gonorrhea analysis has been  available for many years. Unfortunately,  few doctors automatically test for  chlamydia yet. Since chlamydia is a  major cause of PID and ten percent of  women tested at Vancouver clinics  have it, women should be checked out  for it regularly.  According to Lidstone, • the best way  for heterosexuals to prevent PID is to  use barrier methods of birth control.  The best is condoms and foam together,  she says. .  The Canadian PID Society was formed j  last summer after a group of women had  cooperated to put out an information  booklet on PID. They wanted to respond  to the lack of awareness about the  disease in an on-going way and provide  support for women who suffer from it.  Many of its board members have PID.  The society shares office space in the  Women's Health Collective building  where they have lots of information  about the. disease. Anne Lidstone coordinates outreach programs and support  services while she staffs the office.  They are open on Monday and Wednesday  from 11-5 every week.  One of the society's goals is to have  the provincial governments declare  chlamydia a notifiable disease like  gonorrhea. That would mean if you are  diagnosed as having chlamydia, health  Officieal must notify and treat everyone you had sex with.  Maureen Moore: "Before a province can  make chlamydia a notifiable disease, it  must spend money on programs providing  free testing and treatment. Most  Canadian provinces (except Ontario  and Saskatchewan) have chosen to save  money at the expense of women's health."  "One can't help wondering if there would  be such a silence about a disease that  affected 140,000 young Canadian.men  and could render them infertile or in  chronic pain."  The society is in need of money. They  depend on memberships, donations and  government grants to survive but  they have just been denied a city grant  because they are supposedly eligible  for federal Health and Welfare money.  But that money is all gone for this  year. J4o-Name Columrr^  by Joan Meister  The thing about these generic products  is that you never know what to expect.  The price is right but the quality  varies. You can't tell from one time  to the next whether they're going to  be the big, juicy, funny ones or the  little, hard serious ones. You just  have to take what you get, I guess.  Your regular columnist, you see, is  somewhat indisposed. She's writing  this play which has just gone into  rehearsals. And thanks to the wonders  of high and low technology, I got to  write the No Name Column this month.  I received a call from this woman who  said that she was writing this play  that has a character in a wheelchair.  She wanted to know if I'd talk to her  about being in a wheelchair.  This is the wonders of low-technology  part—it can be sort of like a coffee  table book at a boring party. "How  much does it cost?" "Guess" "Four hundred dollars?" "Nope" "Five?" "Guess  again". "I can't" "About twelve hundred."  "Wow.' That's amazing!" "It sure is and  they can put seven people into space,  too, briefly."  It was also quite refreshing. Most times,  people just kind of look at you funny or  try to be really, condescendingly  helpful or make assumptions (which are  often incorrect) about what to do.  Rarely do they just come right out and  ask you to tell them how to do it,  what it's like or how it feels. I said  sure and that we could probably cover  everything she needed to know about  whhelchairs by taking a stroll down to  Chinatown for noodle soup (one must  seize these opportunities when they  present themselves!).  When we got back from noodle soup after  a completely regular sort of a trip  (no near misses at the vegetable vendors, no flat tires, no visually impaired drivers speeding around corners),  I looked at a few parts of the play,  the parts about the character in the  wheelchair.  I had a couple of suggestions and that  led us to a discussion about how these  . playwrights actually do it. "Are ryou  going to have to retype this-whole manuscript all the time?" I asked, incredulously. Cultural workers work.  Now here's the high tech part: I have  this computer and I think I'm in love.'

Not  to mention labour saving. How many  relationships can you say that much  about?  But it seems that a lot of women suffer  from the same thing I used to have. Fear  of floppies. Morgan and I were introduced  by a mutual friend so it seemed the  least I could do was share the remedy. I  said, "Come into my bedroom and I'll  show you." She was afraid but I understood. I'd been there. I think it was  when I showed her what the delete button  could do that she got that unmistakeable  gleam in her eye. To make a long story  short, she is now_ involved in a relationship with an IBM clone too.  In the" meantime, I had volunteered to put  the play on Morgan. It's sort of like  owning a car. One has a duty to share  it with those who don't have one. How*  ever, it-was also a somewhat self-  serving gesture. I hadn't been doing anything for Women and Words lately, and  I felt guilty. Also, I love it. I'm  not sure when the thrill will be gone  but I think it's just possible that  it won't be. Ever.

It is time to recognize many political  prisoners in South Africa for what they  are—prisoners of war.  The South African  government is skilled at using terminology that misrepresents their abominable actions. A government that opens  fire on children throwing rocks has  taken a stance of civil war. A national majority that 'finally takes up  arms in response to decades of police  brutality, acts of genocide and denial  of voting rights,  is on the defensive.  To say that thousands of anti-apartheid  protestors incarcerated are criminal  prisoners,  undermines the reality.  They  are prisoners of war.  They are impris- ,  oned to render them politically impotent.  While they are there,   they are  tortured and humiliated with the  intention of breaking their spirit of  rebellion.  Because this is a war and  acts of defiance are not only civil  disobedience,   the use of prisons as a  means of quelling dissent is a failure.  The disenfranchised are on a path toward freedom from white Afrikaner  rule and even gross maltreatment of  individuals in prisons won't stop them.  In South Africa and Namibia (which is  illegally occupied by South Africa) the  prison system cannot be seen as an isolated institution. The concept of incarceration permeates into the daily lives  of most citizens. This is partly due to  the system that forces people to be  Jailed in their own homes (banning) and  also due to the licence that police and  South African Defence Force (SADF) members have to punish without reason, anywhere. This latter policy ensures that  the majority of urban black people live  their already restricted lives in constant fear of harassment, as do those  in prisons.  "Well meaning people have imagined the  young police and army officers as fearful,  confused somewhat deserving of pity  and under standing... this is not so.  The  majority of my peers are not afraid or  confused.  They are in turn bored and  excited,   they want action,   they are  eallous,  and enormously arrogant. " They  carry out their actions in an "atmosphere of sport,   kaffir (derogatory word  for black people) baiting and hunting."  -written by a white army serviceman  Police and army members are free to  kill or maim black citizens, knowing,  as in war situations, that they will  rarely be held accountable for their  actions. It is the police who interrogate  prisoners and jailers are similarly  above the law. Occassionally public  attention has been able to force a severe persecutor to trial but they are  usually aquitted or, if found guilty,  fined a minimal amount (often Rand 50,  $25).  Further evidence of war practise by the  South African government, is the treatment of children. There is a policy to  kill and intimidate children. It is assumed'  that the government hopes that this  treatment will be a lesson to others who  can back away and not protest further.  However, the government's actions are  self-defeating.  "I was 'called by a noise outside my  house—it was the noise of guns...I came  out and saw that the children had been  shot. My youngest, aged five, was wounded  in the back and on her left leg, my  other, aged seven, was wounded on her  back. The Hippo (army vehicle) had already  Urban black children observe this kind of  treatment regularly. Hundreds of children have been shot. They know that there  is no way to escape the arbitrary gun  fire and beatings of servicemen. They  have nothing to lose by using petrol  bombs, stones, boycotts and street patrols to try and change their society.  When children are jailed they are held  in cells with adults. Often war prisoners  are not separated from criminals. One of  the most powerful punishments used against  citizens is withholding information about  detainees. If servicemen are observed  arresting children,their families have  evidence enough to start on an often  futile hunt of police stations and prisons.  Even if a child is traced, there is no  guarantee of lega'l representation, nor  can a family member necessarily visit.  If a child is brought to trial it is  often the first chance a parent has to  see them. There are many accounts of  terrified children on the stand, bearing  wounds and scars froms severe beatings  and other torture.  However, many children disappear and when  enquiries are made, police say they  have no knowledge of them, and suggest  that they have crossed the border to  join freedom fighters in neighbouring June ^ Kinesis    11  INTERNATIONAL  countries. When families hear this,  their understanding is that their children have been picked up and killed.  The psychological damage deliberately  inflicted on children in South Africa  is enormous. It can only be assumed that  this is part of a government plan to  incapacitate the future ruling generatiori.  The government should however learn from  history.  The Minister of Law and Order (sic)  stated that during the period- of state  of emergency from July 7th, 1985 to  January 31st, 1986, 2,016 people under  the age of 16 years were detained. The  Detainees' Parents Support Committee  assesses this figure to be low. Of those  held in Diepkloof prisons during the latter half of 1985, over half of them were  minors and had been in jail more than  six months. The possibility of being in-  ■ carcerated is part of the daily fear of  many South Africans. Here are some of  the reasons for arrest.  •for being on a street after curfew—  many black townships have curfews of  9 pm or 10 pm. Black people have to be  out of "white" areas unless permission  is obtained.  •for being in an area designated for a  "racial" group other than your own.  •a person supplying accomodation to more  than officially allowed can be arrested.  •for threatening "internal state security"—this can really mean anything.  Any opposition to the government such  as being an active member of the  United Democratic Front means exposure to arrest.  •public violence—which includes being  in the presence of someone throwing  stones, etc.  •being at a public gathering which is  banned—such as a funeral.  •supporting the aims of the African  National Congress (ANC) or supporting  ANC views through public action.  •a person can be detained by a police  officer, a prison official or soldier  if they deem it necessary for the  maintenance of the public order. No  offence need by committed.  These many arbitrary forms of detention  directly benefit the state and economy  of South Africa. It is not a coincidence  that the number of "political arrests" *  rises and falls with the white farmers'  need for labourers.  Farmers and other business opportunists may have contracts with prisons  for labourers. Many detainees are  given the "choice" of being held in  priosn or being contracted out. As  there is no minimum wage, the contractor need pay very little. Most prison  labourers are known to work 12 hour  days, be given cheap, starchy food and be  be locked up at night. Women are vulnerable to sexual assault and severe  sexual assault and severe physical  abuse. They have no legal recourse.  Those women who are incarcerated in  prisons also experience severe punishment and humiliation. It is common  for them to be sent to prisons far  from home so that visits will be kept  to a minimum. Their families were  often denied travel documents under  the pass law system. Now they are unlikely to find an approved place to  sleep near the prison. Also most'  relatives cannot afford to travel long  distances.  Isolation from family is only one  form of punishment. Other complaints by  women and children in prisons are:  •having a visiting relative sent away  because they can only communicate in  their home language and not Afrikaans  —the language of the jailers.  •extended periods of sleep deprivation  •sexual abuse  •being forced to stand or exercise for  long periods with their hands above  their heads. During such times women  cannot break to use the toilet. They  are physically abused if they become  exhausted and stop.  •some cells have'ankle-deep water  •lack of physical exercise  •tear gas is sprayed in water then  their heads are submerged in the water.  •women are "hooded" with a sack—often  the material has been permeated with  a noxious substance.  •while "hooded, women are suspended  and turned round and round in a punishment known as the "helicopter".  ' •while "hooded", women are threated  with being thrown off high places  or by making- them jump into what may  be oblivion. (A large number of pris-  tured, they may not receive treatment  for months.

(However in the  same Bill, whipping was retracted as a  form of punishment for people arrested  for being homosexual or practising buggery).  When women enter the prison system they  are stripped and forced to bend over.  They are then internally searched. If  there are several women, the jailer does  not change surgical gloves for each  woman. As women are searched anally  and vaginally, all women have vaginal  and anal infections.  One of the most common complaints in  South African prisons is that there is  a lack of medical care. Women are tor-  Those who are shot by servicemen at funerals, boycotts, at home, etc. are not  in a position tQ, seek medical attention  from hospitals as all those needing such  assistnace must be reported to the state  by physicians. They are then automatically  detained and will not necessarily receive  medical attention once in prison.  This type of state control underlines the  vulnerability of all citizens to being  imprisoned and denied the most basic  rights. Anyone who opposes the state,  black or white, is seen by the ruling  Nationalist Party as a person who threatens the perpetuation of Afrikaaner domination, and should be rendered ineffective.  By using terminology that belies their  action, the government does not fool most  South African citizens. Terms such as  "being returned to the homelands" and  "politically detainee" only satisfies  those who want to believe that all is well  in South Africa. The majority of the  people who are fighting such a stance know  they will not stop fighting because of the  torture they may endure in prisons. For  many opponents of apartheid it is only  a matter of degree between how they are  treated on the street and in prison. Many  people's lives attest to that.

Sandra Butler on incest:  Healing the survivors  by Kim Irving and Vicky Donaldson  Sandra Butler,  author of  Incest, Conspiracy 'of Silence {published in 1978)  is a frequent visitor to Vancouver.  While here she presents workshops for  counsellors working with incest survivors and for incest survivors.  She  is currently working on a new book on  healing for survivors tentatively titled  Once Upon a Time.  In your work with incest survivors you  u%e techniques which rely on writing.  What is involved in your writing workshops?  Every woman has her own neat idiosyncratic language, her metaphor of language that expresses what is us in the  world we can hear it, write, say it  out loud, in our language. We can then  begin to design the ways we need to  heal.  What I do is help them get in touch  with the language, which is anothPi-  way to say the unconscious. This other  language is not the linear cognitive  language because that is not a productive language. That's a language where  all the defensives live. You can get  through major obstacles but it would  take years and years if you did it in  a linear kind of way. I find that  writing exercises can do that.  We talk about the relationship of your  anger of this week to when you were a  little kid; learning that you are in  a relationship.With everything else.  Sometimes in order to really catapult  them into the feelings, what I might  do is suggest we finish these sentences: an angry woman is  ; an  angry man is ; if somebody  important to me is angry at me I feel   ; and bounce, bounce, bounce  so there's no thinking.  In your workshop,   "Healing the Healers",  I bet a lot of healers are survivors.  Absolutely. The reason a lot of healers  are survivors is that when* you are a  child and sexual violence is in your  life, one of the things you learn to be  is hyper-vigilant. What happens when  you are so scrupulously attentive to  your environment is you can run a terrific group. You can see who's tense and  who's anxious, who's shy, who's taking  a lot of space—it's completely automatic.  We, as healers who have not done our  own work, find ourselves as caretakers  without boundaries. The survivor, therapists who never learned to say, "this is  where it begins and ends," may have the  crisis clients at 3 o'clock in the  morning; may have clients with their  home numbers. It really gets in the  way of your being able to heal others.  To be a good healer you need to get out  of your own way.  How do you think feminist therapists  feel about traditional therapists?  It varies. Grassroots, activist women  can often respond in adversarial, polarized ways. They may believe "these  people have no informal ton "that I need,  I don't want to know anything they know."  Professional feminist therapists who  have had good clinical training don't .  really have many positive or negative  feelings about traditional therapists.  They're able to extract the useful  information from traditional therapy,  but this has to do with power and gender.  I think: one of the things that is dangerous and that I see all the time is a  model of feminist therapy that looks .  like this... "you're a woman, and I'm a  woman, we sit down and face each other,  we love each other as women, we understand." It doesn't work like that, particularly since in sexual abuse the most  available rage that they feel is often  at their mothers.  How do you feel about prevention programs  in schools?  They are a wonderful first step. However,  I do have several criticisms. First, most  of the prevention material I see is based  on the need to protect the child, there's  "tell a grownup, tell mom" which lets  the kid understand that grownups are responsible for keeping kids safe, which  makes kids feel even more unsafe considering prevention materials present grownups as abusers. My view of prevention  would be much more empowering to kids,  giving kids resources and information to  act in their own best intersts. Kids can  do that.  Second thing is prevention programs are  extraordinarily classist and racist.  They presume a comfort and familiarity  with language as a way of expressing a  reality that is very white and very middle class.  The third thing is trying to talk about  sexual violence without talking about  sexuality. Very often the only sexual  information children will get from  grownups is from prevention programs in  the classroom—and it's about sexual  violence. So here we come with all of our  good intentions talking about sexual violence and not talkingabout sex.  Another problem that happens in- prevention programs is the use of the term  "your private parts". I hate the idea  of private parts because it's very confusing for kids when we give it to them  in such a simple-minded way. It doesn't  allow the kid to really assess the complexities. The programs also leave out  the primary place that abuse happens  and that's in the mouth. Private parts  are just under your bathing suits.  Also,  oral sex is rareiy mentioned.  I know, and that's the main one.  How do you work with survivors on  sexuality?  When heterosexual women or lesbians  come to me If they are not in a relationship they almost never say, "I  want to pay attention to my sexuality."  Now that suggests to me if everybody  would leave those of us who have •  been abused alone, our sex lives are  the last thing we would be paying  attention to. There are so many other  things that need to be paid attention  to: our ability to feel good about  ourselves, to be able to be intimate,  we could be better parents—there's  a million things that survivors want  to work on and need to work on.  When survivors,are in a couple, both  lesbians and heterosexuals, they will  say "I can't have an orgasm" or "I  have flashbacks" and I think, "why do  they care about it?" It's because  their lover wants them to be sexual  and they feel that they need to be  sexual because it's part of what we  have been taught; that our sexuality  is relational, it's not ours. That's  fundamentally what's wrong. So if I  do sexuality work with survivors I  do it only with them. "You're going  to take your sexuality back inside  your body, it's yours.  How can feminist therapy be more  accessible and affordable for incest  survivors?  The first answer to that, a leader-  less support group is a wonderful  first step. There is enough information from the last ten years to know  how to do a leaderless support group.  Some translations need to be made for  incest survivors so that they'll have  access to-that information.  I think that feminist clinicians and  feminist social workers need to understand their obligation and responsibility to women, (like lawyers who  take a certain percentage of non-  paying or low-paying clients). They're  part of a communtiy and have that  responsibility.  J still see silencing around incest in  the feminist community.  Is this your  experience?  No, that's not my personal experience  but there are lots of silences. That's  not a silence I'm finding but it may  be organizing just isn't happening  in Vancouver. If each one of the women  who came to my workshop organized a  group, it would make an enormous difference.  However, when I went to all the incest ,  workshops at the A.W.P. (Association  of Women in Psychology) conference and  nobody talked about women who have been  sexually abused by their mothers.  Nobody talked about women who had been  abused by their lesbian therapists.  That's a big silence.  If we don't break the silence about our  experiences, about our lives, and wait  for the traditional people, the status  quo people to do it, we are going to get  distorted out of existence. It is in our  best interest to speak first.  What happens when I work with women who  have been abused by their moms is, they  : say to me (and they're right) "What can  I read?" At least with other survivors  I can say read this or read that. There's  no way for them to see their experience  reflected anywhere. I went to a woman at  a feminist publishing house and said  "we must have an anthology of first-hand  accounts of women who have been abused  by their mothers." She looked at me like  I had obviously internalized woman-hating I  If any woman in any city put one ad in  the feminist press, "Wanted: Stories of  assaults by moms" you'd have an anthology  in six months.  You'd have six anthologies. Now, I don't  know how we need to intervene, whether  this is male-identified behavior or  whether this is something different. We're  not going to begin to get to that step  unless we break the silences. Do you know,  not a single feminist in 15 years has done  an analysis on battered kids." Why? Because  we're the ones who batter them.  When doe  : victim become a survivor?  One moment after the assault ends. Literally to survive in an environment that is  hostile, that's alien, that's punitive,  and takes many forms. The survival may be  going out of the world, the survival can  be not to feel anything.  Audre Lorde uses a phrase: "We need to  move from being victims to being survivors. But to be a survivor in a misogyn-  istic woman-hating world is not enough.  ^wwwwwwwa^^ June '86 Kinesis   13  Children  Myths on  sexual  assault  [continuing  by Deirdre Maultsaid  Child sexual assault has received a lot of  attention in the media, the school sys.tem  . and in the Ministry of Human Resources in  the last few years. I'm angry at the myths  about child sexual assault that continue  to be propagated by these groups. I disagree with the treatment of men who sexually assault children.  Consider the case of Robert Olav Noyes.  This teacher and principal pled guilty  in January of this year to 19 counts of  child sexual assault. Noyes assaulted  children over a period of 15 years in  several B.C. school districts. Since he  was convicted, there have been 4-5 long  days of sentence hearing which heard 28  witnesses, many of them psychiatrists.  The Crown prosecutor wants Noyes designated as a 'dangerous offender' which means  he would receive an indefinite prison  term — supposedly to keep society safe  forever from this "monster". Noyes' lawyer  has argued that this is cruel and unusual  punishment: Noyes has a wife and two kids,  so he should be given a short jail sentence and a long probation.  The women's liberation movement has been  working for 15 years to discredit the myth  of the "pervert in the bushes" as the only  rapists and child sexual assaulters. We  have been working to expose the ordinary  men who sexually assault children, rape  and beat women. Sensationalistic media coverage and the practices of medical and legal institutions interfere with our efforts  as feminists.  Psychiatrists have labelled Noyes a "fixated homosexual pedophile" - a medical term  to describe a "perverted sexual interest"  in boys. The label used for Noyes can be  another way to scapegoat homosexuals and  deny the reality of "upstanding family men"-  who get away with sexually assaulting female children every day. We know that most  attacks on children are committed by normal  heterosexual men.  Eight hundred incidents of violence against  women and children were reported to us at  Rape Relief and Women's Shelter in 1985.  continued from previous page  It's not good enough to survive. We need  to go to the next step which is to become  a warrior."  I work with survivors from victimization  (which is the silencing) to survivor  (which is to understand the patterns and  ways we survive) to moving beyond. This  is where feminist analysis comes in.  When you have done your work, your history,  your development, you are, as a feminist,  responsible for not only your own growth,  it is responsibility for the ten year olds  who are still trapped. In order to take  responsibility for those who come after  us, we need to become warriors.  Of sexual assaults on those under 19 years  old, 52% of the attackers were actually  men in the child's family. The targets of  male attacks are usually female: child or  adult. In 1985, of the attacks reported to  us on children under 1-4 years old, there  were four times as many girls as boys.  Naming Noyes a "fixated pedophile" also  helps him pretend he sexually assaulted  children because he Is "psychologically  ill". The medical profession believes there  is a cure for this illness. Noyes has received electroshock therapy and been given  an antiandrogen (hormonal) drug. Similar  treatments have been used on men who have  been convicted of rape.  Drugs and shock therapy are intended to  stop men's "deviant" sexual fantasies.  These treatments are often used in conjunction with pornography in order to train men  to not respond to certain "deviant" sexual  images. The argument goes: if these men  are chemically castrated or reconditioned  in their sexual response they will no longer sexually assault or rape.  The overwhelming evidence from thousands  of women and children, as reported to rape  crisis centres, convinces us this isn't  true. Some researchers support this feminist analysis. According to Dr. R. Freeman  Longo, at a conference on the sex offender  this February in Vancouver, the treatment  does not even prevent men from having an  erection and there is no proof that it  changes either mens': fantasies or their  behaviour. The medical.practice of altering mens' sexual conditioning sickens and  frustrates me. It doesn't take an erection  to sexually assault a child or rape a woman. It's not mens' sexual fantasies that  worry me necessarily; it's their acts of  contempt and violence against women and  children.  This medical model used for dealing with  rapists and child sexual assaulters does  not tell- the truth about male attacks.  Child sexual assault and rape are conscious  acts of power, acts any man could choose  to do. From our experience as rape crisis  and transition house workers, we know there  is no particular psychological type, no  mental state, no sexual preference, no class  or race or age of men that makes them more  likely to terrorize and attack women and  children. The only thing the men have in  common is their gender and their chosen  acts against us. One "pedophile" cannot be  blamed while all the other men are excused  for their sexism.  Noyes held a position of authority, as a  teacher and a principle. He chose to misuse  his authority over children. He was neither  sick nor out of control. Noyes has to be  held responsible: he asserted his adult  male power over children in his care.  Noyes, however, is not the only man responsible. He couldn't get away with 15 years  of child sexual assault without the help  of other men. According to news reports  there were many men, in positions of authority, who knew of Noyes' assaults.  In 1978, two mothers were ready to report  Noyes to the police. One of them sought  the cooperation of Jack Thomas, then principal of Roy Stibbs Elementary School in  Coquitlam, where Noyes taught. Thomas dissuaded the woman because "it would harm  the reputation of the school."! In 1978,  Berglojot Bright, a female psychiatrist  at UBC Day House was convinced Noyes would  not stop sexually assaulting children. Her  superiors allowed Noyes to go back to  teaching. The opinions of these women were  not acted on.  Bruce Avis, a superintendent in the  Ashcroft school district also knew of  Noyes' actions and did not prevent them.  He has since moved to Australia where he  can't be called to account for his silence.  John Blatherwick, who in 1978, was health  officer for the Coquitlam area also knew  of Noyes' actions and did not act to prevent them.  Many of the psychiatrists who saw Noyes  over the last 15 years knew he was sexually  assaulting children. They tried to encourage him to stop. But, ultimately, their  inaction protected their client rather  than the children at risk.  The inaction of Noyes colleagues and psychiatrists has been exposed in the media.  Several school boards have asked Attorney  General Brian Smith to make an inquiry.  They are searching for the fault in their  system that allowed this "sicko" to continue teaching and sexually assaulting for  so long. But the point that is not being  made is: Noyes colleagues did hide his behaviour. The result was they protected  ,Noyes and the status of their profession  while children were sexually assaulted by  Noyes in the meantime. The psychiatrists  were committed to their treatment program  for Noyes and committed to their client  confidentiality. But their committment  did not "cure" Noyes and he went on sexually assaulting.  Now Noyes is caught. He will be sentenced  June 9th. At this point I don't know what  BC Supreme Court Justice Raymond Paris will  decide. Clearly in the past there hasn't  been consistent sentencing of child sexual assaulters. According to the Vancouver  Sun  and provincial court records, in BC,  in 1985, Terrence Turrell, a foster father  was convicted of 15 counts of sexual assault against one 15 year old girl. He  was given a seven year prison term, and  the girl was awarded $30,000 in compensation. Walter Nugent, a girls' softball  coach, was convicted of two counts of sexual assault. He was ordered to psychiatric  The judge isn't taking my advice  as a feminist, a rape crisis and  transition house worker about  what should be done with Noyes.  I'm not given the power to make  the decision.  treatment, four months jail and two and  a half years probation. Paddy Graber, a  folk dance teacher, was convicted of one  count and given a one year jail sentence.  Obviously with sentencing, a lot rests on  the judge's attitude.  There are only approximately 4-0 designated  dangerous offenders in Canada. But perhaps  Justice Paris will decide to make an example of Noyes by sentencing him harshly.  The judge isn't asking my advice as a feminist, a rape crisis and transition house  worker about what should be done with  Noyes. I'm not given the power to make the  decision. But it is my opinion that the  current legal system offers no real rehabilitation for men — rehabilitation that  would work in the interests of women and  children as well as the men. Imprisonment  does not usually change mens' attitudes  nor their actions against women and children. And of course only a small percentage  of men are convicted. Medical treatment  will not stop Robert Noyes. Fifteen years  of psychiatric coddling did not compell  Noyes to change.  Exposing Noyes in public and denying him  .any position of authority over children  are more likely to change his behavior.  Noyes should be prevented from all contact with children, including his own, if  their mother wishes it.  The best of the worst choices may be imprisonment and psychiatric treatment for  Robert Noyes. But I say: no more excuses  of "pedophile" or "fixated homosexual".  Whatever the judge decides, Noyes should  be dealt with as one ordinary man amongst  the many who assert their power over us.  If so many men hadn't protected or excused  Noyes he could have been stopped 15 years  ago.

What kind of directions  has it taken or have there been different directions because women have become  involved in a very important and prom-  inant way?  Joan:  You've asked so many questions,  let's deal with the first part of your  question about how women have affected  the movement. Our organization, which  is called the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is one which has been in  existence for a very long time. It was  very active^in the late fifties at a  time when t||ere>*was atmospheric testing,  and then following the partial test ban  '','£i?e&i*!f it went rather quiet'ja^-riad'a'-''''  resurgence again in the late^Os. CND  was organized on very standaTai labour  movement lines. It was dominated by  men and men from the establishment in  particular—albeit the progressive establishment*  When the peace movement became very  active again it did change in character.  And one of the fundamental reasons was  the involvement of women. We have restructured our organization because of  the need to ensure equal opportunities  ■for women in the movement. We've actually decided, for example, that we want  the public to see that women are more  involved, so we've taken very sim-  .ple, very basic decisions—such as every  j&ublic platform must be half women.

I would say that  women are the backbone of many of our  groups in terms of commitment and time.  Their commitment impresses me because  many do this work with very strong opposi-  uununx u uiienx impresses me because many  do this work with very strong opposition from their husbands. And their  committment is so deep that even though  it is veryi-trying and causes them  grief, they are so involved that they  hang in there and keep working.  We do have exactly  the same problem  that Joan referred to. I've just been  to a big conference in Montreal,  where women's participation was a  tremendous issue. The planning commi- 1  ttee had been all men, a big broad  sheet with all the high profile  speakers and there wasn't a single  woma&'sjlface on that front page,  v, ^nuriS^&r of us were sort of lumped  m&%££ ±gt a g£eelal "woman' s persj>ectivjs||||l||  sessioW'  Libby t  In some ways, for 1|pFwomgk^v  who are involved, it becomes quitST; ?  stressful.

Libby:  I think one thing that's very  notable in i|je. peace movement today is  that women have their own independent  actions, and I guess Greenham Common  is probably the classic example—where  women have stood united. I think,it  might be interesting to talk a little  bit about why that happened; how Green-  ham Qbmmon came about and why it was  : womefi\who were exclusively involved..  -I  think we .have to ask.* .why hasn't it  ,happened elsewhere?  Joan:  I'm in a privileged position. I  live in an ordinary house, not in a tent  or anything of -that nature, but' I do live  very close to Greenham so 1'was involved  right in the beginning. It's a fascinating story because originally Greenham  was not a women's action. The march that  led to the establishing of the women's  camps at Greenham was actulally a mixed  march. Although, it had been initiated  by women, it had men on it., and when the  marchers decided that they would actually  stay and not go back* it started as a  » mixed camp. So it didn't begin in any  sense as a women's camp.  It was only after about three months that  the difficulties of actually living main-  June 1*6 Kinesis   15  ly in the open or just in tents and eventually in- caravans, in a mixed  community  became apparent. As public and media  attention grew, classic situations arose.  For instance a group of people would be  sitting around the campfire and a famous  journalist or T.V. crew would approach;  the men would stand up and make themselves  ready for the interview and the women  would be asked to put the kettle on.  It was through the experience that women  finally asserted themselves and said,  "we are going to have this space for ourselves." Greenham and the women's camp  has- feee4;jn enormous struggle, one which  v\#«8al4-t^^^S^^%-the peace movement apart.  But it didn't. Instead, it became a solely  Women'S action of the CND in particulars^  - *£»& CHDj'-'a huge organization, decide<M|Q£'  take up th^»;i»omeh^% 9&use and f ight[>as -'  women* within our own movement, to prevent our men from trampling on that space.  5{y personal .view -was very much, "women have  decided to take this particular initiative  and historically men have alway# had that  opportunity. -And so we ought* to allow  women to have this particular place for  themselves."  Joanna:  When you say by consensus, you mean  tfc&t the men did agree finally that this was  a legitimate wew* to go? It wasn't the case  that you-ii8few the men ot&? v  Joant  I wouldn't say, by any means, that  they all agreed that this was the right  strategy. For,a couple of years there was  a lot of bitterness and hard feeling among  mejtji ,andVamong,some women..'-.Some were very  much opposed to Greenha^V^'exelusiveness".

It has gone  - -off the screens for a number of reasons.  ^^^Pe:is quite a feeling in the British  '-onto something else. I think that's a  Hjroblem that needs a lot of debate.  onto something else. I think that's a  I problem for peace "movements everywhere.  ■ A problem that needs a lot of debate.  Today at Greenham there are not large  numbers on a permanent basis. We don't  think that's a problem, as long as the  women there feel that they can be sustained in the face of things like violence, and they can be sustained with  warm clothing and more firewood—-and  the practical things. There are networks throughout Britain that support  Greenham women in this way. The authorities have brought in new by-laws under  some very ancient legislation from the  last century so that now, on a daily  basis, they're able to constantly remove  the women. And they do this on a daily  basis. So staying there is a matter of  enormous hardship.  Libby:  So they get removed and then  they go back and there's a continual  flux of women coming in and out, being  picked up, coming back in...?  Joan:  Yes, and because of this there are  virtually no static camps any longer.  They felt&er live in plastic tents or in  vans.^||||!p5sast time I was there, about  two wel|||^&go>-;there were twelve*«K£nen.  Women come aiod go-,all the time. What* is  vital t'o^fei' and, indeed to the "movement  worldv/wide. Is that there are always  some women ^ESfeerev We are' determined to  sustain that presence. One of the most  important functions that they now have  which does get on the television—but  is perhaps not being broadcast overseas— "  is that the cruise mislfees^ as, you !3ok>w>  are on these huge launch, vehicles. They  have exercises of these3Kghiep.es. We  pledged when we first came toljreenham,  that these vehicles would never go out  in secret, which was the desire'of the  military, bee ausja^||^y-%£C su^posedj *to * *'  be mobileweapons*  Whenever the convoy leaves the base,  and it's usually in the dead of night,  Greerfpria women go to telephones and  the word goes out over a huge telephone  network." No convoy has left that base \\  in the past two years but that has been  tracked by the peace movement. %'i£tr is"a~'-c  fantastic organization.  Libby:  Do either of you have a^f<.opin-<i  ions or views on why this type -o-f^a&iQ'n-*'^ '--  sustained over such a long perio'd'to^Hir  time, hasn't really taken placejelse* ' s  where.  Joanna:  I think one obvious re^enTf^-?'^  the lack of that type of organising, ITSpimply size. This is such an enomous^'couhtry  that just getting people togetfp&^B#y/  being supportive of each other poses f "  a problem. Also, we don't have the'very-,.,-,  dramatic evidence that you have in5-'"  Britain of the actual cruise missiles",  right there and going out. Look at |  Nanoose Bay—how many people even knew' -  about that until this little group-put  ofl on the agenda?  I think one of the problems we have to' f$  face in Canada is that we are coris'^&iy \  being surprised. We have no idea, aff^a  Canadian public, what our relationship5—' -  our real deep gut relationship—is, "to- "  the nuclear strategy of the United States.  Canada should question American nuclear  strategy. What is it about? Is it about "*'  defense or is it about superiority and intervention? We need to question these things-  why the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star  Wars) are going into these new things^ And  we must question our arms control activity^  is there no commitment to arms contro^^H  It certainly looks as though there isnlt*  Yesterday we talked about how we're  locked into systems that even the Gan^^^  dian government doesn't know about. Thai?"^'  there's sort of a general master agroel||Bl  ment around NORAD but that all of the  ^ '  sub-agreements are secret. For me the  major issue that the peace movement has  got to face is how to get this relationship out into the open and understood.  How can we deal with it if we don't even  know what it is?  Libby:  Something I wanted to pick up on  that you said yesterday at the press  conference—you said that the peace movement had to observe the three "Ds" which  are: "disbelief, demonstration and disobedience". In Canada I suppose we may  have partially obtained disbelief.  We are now critically questioning information that comes from our government on  our involvement with the Americans. As  well, we've certainly been involved in  demonstrations, but as far as disobedience, I think generally in Canadian  soeiety there are a minority of people  j Who' are willing to take a stand in terms  of - dlsobedience.  Joanna: Our disbelief has got to become  much more pervasive. So it's not only a  few who are sceptical. There is evidence  which looks at President Reagan's  behavior over Nicaragua where it's  Cfuite clear he doesn't observe the UN  -Cbftfctfgc. in spite of the fact that  the whole western hemisphere is opposed  '; ,1»:[mi^itaS7',-,^etion, hejgpess it as his^  right to do .that. And then we see^what's  just happened in Libya, These events,  ftGm3i|j| §0 olos^s together are going to  give a tremendous impetus to that  scepticism* We have to work extra hard  right now to make sure that the message of these events is not lost and  we don't all go back to "oh well, I  guess"itfs'-ajrjlglxt really, if I don't  think about It,"  IJibby:  Maybe we coul^just spend-a couple  of minutes talking a£$|it future development and the kinds- of things we think  need>^> h8$pexE£ als&hkw; these things  particularly.- affeeAf-women in the move- •  ment,^ ^K'r^L'.^  Joan:  An issue "that has become an $§  important one in Britain, which we  haven't touched upon, is that of  ethnic minorities. We obviously have  a great many people who originally  come from the Afro-Carribean or from  Asians living J.n Britain, Arid jUis&s  become quite obvious that tfteiasgBr-......-  ticipation in most political movej&fents  is much much less and-for obvious  reasons because they tend to have a  greater struggle economically to actually survive in Britain, particularly  .now there's such*a depression*- -  So one of our current goals in CND is  to increase the involvement of women  and men,-but women in particular, from .  the ethnic minorities. We have an anti-  raeist group operating within our movement, both to ensure that we are in no  sense a racist organization, which as  you know, you have to wofk very hard  at because it's so endemic in us,-and''  secondly to actually bring people from  ethnic minorities into the movement  .in -a positive way.  As to what we've got to do overall,  our position Is that it is the growing  need for political organisation that  will take most of our time. We have  tried very hard to influence the  British Government. We've had no sue-  .cess whatsoever. As you all know, ■  Margaret Thatcher is completely besotted  by Ronald Reagan, and I use that term in  its sexist sense. We have no hopes  whatever of change in that government.  We therefore are committed to changing the  government. C-^jfl  Our work is increasingly within the  opposition parties and our goal is to  see that there is an alternative government in Britain by 1988, that it's a  government that has real disarmament on  its timetable. We have just committed  ourselves to a new and very thorough  going public information campaign. It's  a movement—not away from demonstration  because we will still continue to demonstrate and we will still continue to  disobey—but it's actually to put as  the absolute top priority public information campaigning. And we've actually  set out a program that will last for  18 months and will involve very very  hard work, at the grass roots level.  Libby:  Are we headed in the same direction, Joanna? Are we going to dump the  government? We've got the Liberals and  the Conservatives both doing the same  old thing. And we've got a third party.  Are we going to dump the two old ones?  Joanna:    I don't see any particular  strategies across Canad%^J**-^ue^j}na^v-^  ^5HS]^fe^1®|^:^l*3t-'sections of thejtseommi-  . ni^have^'their own idea but I don't  see apisy working in that direction  through the peace alliance or anything  like that. I certainly think women are  going to continue to be a tremendously  important force in the work. And I see  them across the country setting up support groups which help each other through—  meet regularly, reinforce and nourish  each other and so on.  As to what we've got to do, I've been  going through quite a trauma in my own  thinking during the last four months,  partly as a result of what I saw when I  was at the U.N. for five weeks with the  Canadian delegation last fall. I lived  in the United States all through the ^;  period whenjieagan came to New Yorkjpnd  said, "Oh, J||p summit isn't really-about  arms control, it's about linkage to the  Sbviet^ltoioiiis behavior in Aff|hanistan,  human righ^^nd so on."  I've come to the conclusion that the  reason the peace movement is not having  a lot of successes is that we are concentrating far too much on the symptom.  That there's this weapons system here  or this evidence of our being tied into  the nuclear system there at Nanoose .  Bay and so on. Until we ask ourselves  what this arms race is about: why are we  dividing the world into east and west? Is  there really no way that the Soviet  Union and their friends, and also the  West and their friends can live together?  I think this sort of enemy image and confrontation has been very carefully put  upon the western public and I expect the  same in the Soviet Union, to keep the  whole thing going *jg||  The other thing that I think we have to  face is" the'dl^isioia between" North *an& .;.-  South.

Over the past year my  involvement has lessened considerably.  In the last few months I have begun  a process of analysis that includes  looking at what the peace movement is,  what feminist involvement means, and  how we put (or don't) put our  theories into action.  I began as a white middle class woman  anti-nuker, very much afraid that I  might die in a nuclear war. Incredible  as it seems to me now, I really believed that if enough of us demanded  it, the governments would get rid of  nuclear weapons and everything would  be all right. The work that needed  doing all seemed valid and very obvious. I didn't hesitate. I plunged  right in and began to organize, to  write letters, to carry picket signs,  and to talk, and to talk, and to  talk...  Soon I began to realize that there was  a whole lot more happening in the  world than nuclear weapons. People were  dying in wars all over the world. And  then I began to see the undeclared  wars that were being waged.  Again I started with what was affecting me personally. I began to see  the sexism and the hierarchies in the  "peace" groups I worked with. So, I  began working predominantly with  women's groups. Here at least, sexism  was not a problem and the way we  worked together was said to be important. There was agreement that all  the issues were*I9fihected and, at  least on a theoretical level, that we  needed to challenge each other when  we were oppressive or using our privilege to another's detriment.  But since all the issues were connected to peace, and because most of us  had enough privilege that no issue was  directly and immediately affecting us,  the "out there" work that needed to  be done no longer seemed pressingly  obvious. A lot of time was spent  talking theroetically about our group  process, about oppression and about  what to work on. Everything needed to  be worked on; there was no one key  issue, no best way of doing anything.  Reaching a real goal seemed far  away. And we always seemed too few.  Frustrated, I gave up on the movement  and on groups.  Now, as I look back I can see some of  the problems more clearly; some of the  contradictions, and I have many questions. We all know that the women's  peace movement is/was predominantly  white and middle class. It is that  which gives us the time to talk so  abundantly. And yet, the assumption  .that we are ail  from that same background creates problems.  I know of a working class woman who  left a women's peace group because  another woman had referred to their  group as "obviously white, middle-class.'  Thereby making the life, experiences,  and attitudes of the other woman invisible. Unless classism in a group is  openly addressed and worked on, a  hierarchy can be set up that is the  same as the one in the world we are  trying to change: the more visible,  articulate and therefore more powerful  (sorry, but it's true) women in peace  groups will tend to be middle class,  while working class and poor women will  tend to be less visible, do the less  "fun" jobs, and have their daily life  MOVEMENT  experiences invalidated. We need to not  only identify various oppressions (e.g.  racism, classism, etc.) but also challenge ourselves about the ways in which  we maintain our privilege.  It is also true that the ability to be  predominantly concerned with global  survival is a privilege and a luxury  afforded primarily to those of white,  middle class background. To most others  daily survival takes precedence.  "Peace" as it is defined by the mainstream and even when it is broadened by  feminists, is often something far  away and distinct from the issues and  concerns of the majority of women. And  yet we white, middle class women often  try to. tell other women what their concerns should be and become frustrated  when they don't join us in our issues.  Although we may deny that they exist,  there are many hierarchies within the  feminist peace movement. Who's an activist? Who's political? Who is politically correct? "So what do you  do  politically?" Seldom are questions like  these voiced, but they do exist and  they are all filled with judgements.  It has, been said that "politics are  not a single issue but everything that  we do in our lives." Peabe and politics  are more than bombs, governments and  conflicts between nations.  US imperialism, but few protested  Bill C-4-9—the recent anti-street  soliciting law. All of these are  survival issues but privilege determines which affects your life  more directly. For middle class,  white women, it is safe and acceptable to be a peacenik; to protest  US imperialism means critically  questioning our privileged position in  in the world; to protest Bill C-<49  means taking a long hard look at  our classism.  It seems too, that often we get overly  stuck in the idea that the only really  valid political action is protesting  things as they are. To emphasize protest  too much invalidates the work that the  majority of women do who do not have the  time or other resources necessary to or-  'ganize or participate in mass protest  actions. Looking next door to create some  peace, create some changes is something  that we can all do and is very basic  peace work. Learning to act powerfully and  take■control of our lives and helping  others to do the same is resistance. Finding ways to share all our resources so  that the basic needs of everyone in our  community is met is a living resistance  and peace work at the most fundamental level.  When I look at the changes that need  to be made, I often feel overwhelmed  and frustrated. It is relatively  easy to say what is wrong and what  the women's "peace" movement should  be doing. It is infinitely more difficult to put those shoulds  into practice. We need to creat alternatives  as well as protest. We need to stop  lithe feminist peace movement is a movement for  fundamental social change, then it ought to  recognize as political activists all those women  who work: for change, however invisibly.  If the feminist peace movement is a  movement for fundamental social change,  then it ought to recognize as political activists all those women who work  for change, however invisibly.  The woman who does childcare for a single  mother, the woman who works voluntarily  at the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre,  the woman who does rape crisis work,  the woman who has a daily struggle for  survival but manages to take her children on the Walk for Peace, are all  equally political. According to their  means, all these women are just as involved with peace work as the woman who  has the time and privilege to go to  Central America.  The scope of social change/peace is relative. To one woman, it may mean dealing  with daily survival issues. To another,  it may mean helping another woman sur- •  vive. The scope of peace broadens with  privilege. Those of us with more privileges can support the woman whose time  and energy must all go towards her dally  survival. We need to make more skills,  resources, and time available to all  women. We need to turn theory into practice and not just recognize the validity  and importance of all issues and campaigns but use our skills and resources  to aid in others * struggles—not to lead  or direct but to carry picket signs, to  write letters, to do childcare, to support.  Hundreds of feminists from the peace  movement march for peace, many protest  judging another woman's participation  or seeming lack of participation. If  we are privileged we need to use that  privilege but not abuse it. We need to  share all  our resources. We need to  build alliances among women of different backgrounds, recognizing that  those alliances will be hollow unless  the differences are faced and worked  through. And especially, we all need  to be better allies.  Peace from previous page  do to people in the Phillipines, do  to people in Southern Africa... Any of  these countries where we have very  very great interests and the people  who suffer, often incredibly in every  form of poverty try to take back the  right to determine their own futures  and develop their lives as they wish.  What do we do? We use our power to protect our privilege.  Until we face that and until we face  what we are doing to them, not only in  this treatment and the use of military  repression and so on, but the fact that  we are taking the world's precious  resourses that they need—and that we  need for our own problems, like acid  rain— and diverting them to the arms  •race while the planet goes down the  tube. I think we've got to face those  basic problems or I think we will just  be playing with the symptoms and we  won't make it.

"  +>,£. +>,-i-f.H rfo-no-ra+.-irm r,-c +.iw TMiaipst aop.^  by Marrianne van Loon  Rosalie Bertell recalls the end of  World War II with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although her family  was happy that the war was over, there  was no celebration in her house. She  remembers her mother saying "they  shouldn't have done it, they shouldn't  have done it."  But Bertell did not become active in  the peace movement until she had a  heart attack in 1972. She stopped  teaching and devoted more time to researching the environmental and hereditary factors influencing leukemia.  "As I learned more I became more and  more involved." When she was invited  to testify on the effects of low-level  radiation at a nuclear plant licencing  hearing and she started asking "Where  did they get permission to give everyone radiation exposure? And who said  it was ok?"  Still, she left the peace aspect to  others until two events forced it into  her consciousness. Eight years ago she  was invited to speak in commemoration  of Hiroshim and Nagasaki in Japan. She  spoke with survivors, living examples  of what she had been researching. Then  she went to a Strategic Arms Limitation  Treaty II (SALT II) briefing—a whole  day describing the weapons of war.  During the quesion period she asked  "How many people die every year in the  production of these bombs?" Finally  Paul Wainke, a key American SALT II negotiator, said quietly into the microphone, "That's not our department."  Said Bertell "that really hit me because I knew the military didn't count  the cost in money but it was so obvious  that they didn't count the cost in lives  either."  For Bertell, there has been no turning  back. She has recently written a book  No Immediate Danger:  Prognosis for a  Radioactive Earth  (The Women's Press:  Toronto,   1985),   about the effects of  low-level radiation, she is the editor  in chief of "International Perspectives  In Public Health," Director of Research  for the International Institute of Concern for Public Health in Toronto, and  a member of the Gray Nuns. She works on  behalf of indigenous peoples and citizen  groups affected by militarism; in particular she is helping the Marshall  Islanders to develop their Medical  Assistance Program.  Kinesis spoke with Bertell in February  as she passed through Vancouver on her  way home from the Marshall Islands.  Kinesis:  Does your perspective have  anything to do with being a woman?  Bertell: Oh yes, it certainly does.  This is a caricature but I think its  fairly accurate. Men somehow or other  consider that their part of life is  economics, how much it costs, what's  the political clout, who's in charge,  who has the most power. They judge activities on maximizing the economics  and the political clout. This is behind  their planning.  Strategic planners have economists and  political scientists, physicists and  engineers. They don't hire biologists,  or medical doctors, geneticists or  pediatricians. They consider the other  part of life—human life—not their  business.  I think it stems from the fact that  somebody has fed them and clothed them  and nourished them and they've never  worried about that part of life. It's  rather astonishing to hear strategic  planners talk about the possibility of  nuclear war out in the Pacific Ocean  without anyone saying "what about our  food?" That's the fish supply for the  people of the world. That doesn't enter  into the equation.  There's very little feeling for the fact  that the earth is alive, the earth recycles everything in the water and the  food, and the air. We need the trees and  the insects and the animals and the birds  in order to live ourselves. There's also  no feeling for the longterm effects on  the human race. If you damage the gene  pool (the effect of low-level radiation)  you produce children who are damanged.  Those children who are physically less  able to cope, and then you give them a  more hazardous world to cope with. You  can't keep doing it. It's a snowballing  disaster undermining survivability of  the human race. And the strategic planners don't think about that, it's not  in the equation.  Kinesis: What do women have to offer?  Bertell: I think women are going to have  to do something about this one. The  women are the ones who have been cleaning  up for years, and this one they can't  actually clean up, so they'd better stop  the whole thing.  It's going to have to come from someone  outside  this system because this system  the third generation of the nuclear age.  I suspect that by the fifth generation  everyone will know what's happened, but  by then it becomes more difficult to  stop it because you've got genetically  damaged people and a genetically damaged earth. We're damaging people.  Quality of life is going to have to be  the value we choose. If we don't have  life, and strength and health, it's  going to become harder and harder to  get anything else. Civilization is a  sham, it's getting rotten from the  inside out.  Kinesis: How do you say stop?  Bertell: Non-cooperation is the basis.  We have to find more ways in which  we cooperate to stop the escalation.  I don't think you can do it alone, you  need to belong to a community where  you keep questioning "how am I helping, how am I cooperating, how can I  withdraw my money and my labour from  this insanity and how can I make my  non-cooperation visible?"  I would expect the peace movement to  eventually say "on Friday between one  and three o'clock nobody is going to  work. We're giving you a message that  we don't approve." If this doesn't work  we do it on Wednesday and Friday and so  on until the message gets across  that we're serious, we're not just  out here parading once a" year saying  we want peace, and meanwhile the rest  of the time helping you prepare for  f would expect the peace movement to  eventually say "on Friday between one and  three o'clock nobody is going to work.     We're  giving you a message that we don't approve."  can't solve its own problems. There's  no economic and political solution. It's  not going to come from the people in  political power because their basis  of power is war. As the threat of war  increases, so does the power of the  leaders, so they're not likely to do  away with the spiral.  Militarism is like a societal addiction.  Once you start seeing it in these terms  you can also understand the abuse people  have been putting up with for years, in  terms of the victim almost co-operating  with the abuse and not complaining about  what's happening.  Funding is going into the wrong things.  The money is going into the addiction,  like what happens whith alcohol and  drugs, and is being withdrawn from  health, welfare, the arts, all the nice  things in life. We don't have enough  money for anything but we have lots of  money for missiles and playing war.  You also begin to realize that you cooperate with the addiction by your passive-  ness and silence. At some point the  victim has to realize that this is a  deteriorating situation and has to say  no, I'm not going to go along with this  stupidity and I'm not going to commit  suicide.  Kinesis:  What is the prognosis for life  on this planet,  even if there is no  nuclear war?  Bertell: We're already into a slow death  syndrome, but it's going to soon become  •very obvious. We're probably now seeing  war. The message has got to get across  loud and clear that business is just  not going to be done.  I would expect women will take the  lead. Women have always been the  change agents in society, while men's  traditional role has been maintaining  the status quo. Major change movements  have been initiated by women.  Kinesis: Is there hope?  Bertell: People give up, but I guess  because of my medical background—  I don't. If somebody has had polio  or a disastrous automobile accident,  you don't say "oh well, this person  is going to be harmed for life so to  heck with it." You don't give up. I  feel that way about the earth. We've  hurt ourselves as a people, the earth,  but you don't just give up and say  '"what the heck, we might as well just  blow the whole thing up." You try to  say "ok, yes, we did do that, let's  stop doing it in the future and let's  maximize what health is left on the  earth and have a decent existence."  I can't understand giving up. Every  individual has to die at some point,  and that doesn't mean you don't ever  live. You don't say "well, I'm doomed  to die therefore I never will live."  I don't understand that attitude at  all. There is hope, there's hope that  we can live and there's no reason to  roll up in the corner and die just  because we've done what we've done  to ourselves. Life belongs to the survivors. 1&   Kinesis June TO  MIDWIFERY  by Maura Volante  "Legislation is coming" said Filippa  Lugtenburg in a luncheon speech on the  final day of "Midwifery in the Americas", a conference put on in late May  by the Midwifery Association of B.C.  (MABC). "The question", she said, "is  not if, but when. And the next question  is how."  Lugtenburg, president of the International Confederation of Midwives, went  on to caution conference delegates  about the dangers of working under the  medical profession, encouraging them to  hold out a little longer, if necessary,  for a certification program-on their own  terms.  Her other message to the midwives  assembled from across Canada and many  other countries was to be loyal to each  other. Alluding to the differences in  practice and philosophy within midwifery communities, she was like an older  sister coming from a more advanced situation (The Netherlands) and passing on  her wisdom from experience.  MABC grew out of a midwive's conference  a few years ago. This year's conference  represents another level of organization, as MABC is now a member group of  the International Confederation of  Midwives. The main theme of this year's  conference reflected an expansion in  the midwifery network, with input from  many areas of the world and a focus on  sharing information about current situations in each country, state or  province.  There were many interesting topics covered with respect to the global connections. Sheila Kitzinger impressed everybody with a lecture on "The Politics of  the Womb". Kitzinger, a British author,  is an international authority on midwifery, and has also published a book  dealing with women's experiences of  sex.  Participants heard about midwifery in  rural Nicaragua from Cheryl Anderson,  a Canadian doctor who spent time there.  Veronica Baez Pollier spoke of the situation in Chile, where despite an oppressive government, midwifery is an established part of the health care system.  Pollier said that the midwives work in  hospitals primarily because the poverty  of people's homes make homebirth more  problematic.  There was also a panel on international  issues with representatives from Australia, Canada, Norway, Jamaica, West  Germany, Japan, the United States and  England.  Dorothea Lang, from New York, wrapped up  the conference on Sunday afternoon with  an analysis of the degeneration and subsequent regeneration of midwifery of midwifery in the modern world.  Global  Connections  for Midwives  On the level of international information-  sharing the conference was a big success,  with a generally optimistic tone and  appreciation for the work of bringing the  conference together.  There were, however, some disturbing aspects to the event. Local issues in the  midwifery community were not on the agenda.  A stranger could have concluded that all  is well in Vancouver and that midwives all  agree on midwifery practice. Meanwhile,  there has been for some time a very heated  debate going on within the birthing community in B.C.. This debate has been  more forcefully raised around the death of  baby Voth last May and the current trial of  the Voth midwives Gloria Lemay and Mary  Sullivan, on charges of criminal negligence.  The debates are complex but the basic  division is based on attitudes towards  the establishment of standards of midwifery practice. Some midwives want certain  guidelines to be followed by all midwives  both for safety reasons and to establish  credibility with-the medical profession.  Such guidelines are seen as a step towards  legalization. These guidelines consider  some pregnant women to be "high risk", and  thus unsuitable candidates for homebirths.  High risk women include those wanting to  have a vaginal birth after a caesarian  delivery (VBAC),' women who are overweight,  and a number of other indicators of possible complications.  Other midwives would like to assess each  case individually and whenever possible  follow the wishes of the birthing women.  They don't see much likelihood of such  guidelines encouraging doctors to hand  over the control of the birthing business,  so they refuse to change their practice  for the sake of the "reputation" of mid-  wives in general.        fc^^M^  I spoke with one woman, who would not be  identified, because her views have been  severely criticized by some members of '  MABC. She would have liked an open discussion of such issues, and regretted that  they weren't oh the conference agenda.  While it is clear that there are major -  benefits to integration of midwifery, within  the health care system, there needs to be  continuing dialogue on the question raised  by Filippa Luxemburg, i.e.—how? It was  disappointing to find this question ignored  in the planning of the conference.  Another difficulty with the conference  was that the registration fees were very  high ($200). This prevented the attendance of many women who could have greatly  benefited from the information and networking opportunities. While operating  expenses must have been high, with such  broad international participation, a sliding scale could have made each participant's  input more equitable. As it was the perspective of low income women was noticeably lacking.  Except for a handful of international  delegates, there was also a noticeable  lack of women of Colour. Along with its  outreach to women of different nations,  MABC would do well to encourage participation by women of different cultures  here in B.C..  With the recent commitment by the Ontario  government to the legalization of midwifery in that province, midwives all  over Canada are hopeful of some movement  in the long climb to regaining lost status.  Washington State  Support Within the System  by Maura Volante  For* a look at a more established midwifery system just across the border,  I spoke with Johanna Myers-Cieko of the  Seattle Midwifery School.  "We don't have a laundry list approach,"  said Johanne Myers-Cieko, representative  of the Seattle Midwifery School, in  speaking of standards in the midwifery  community of Washington State.  I had asked her whether the certification  program that allows midwives to work  legally spelled out conditions such as  no VBACs (vaginal birth after caesarian)  at home. Joanne told me that the law  doesn't define such details, leaving it  up to the midwifery community to work  out acceptable practices.  I asked her about the position of mid-  wives who have trained themselves or have  been trained by other midwives.  She said, "Obviously there are midwives  practising in Washington State who have  not graduated from a formal school. They  are not recognized by the State, and their  legal status is open to question. The way  that the law is written, and we have  fought to keep it that way at this point,  is that, as long as a midwife does not  collect a fee for her services, she cannot  be charged with practising midwifery,  illegally. That's the loophole that lay  midwives use to Continue their practices."  She gave some background to the growth of  the midwifery community that led to the  establishment of the school in 1978.  "In the mid-70's, there was a public  demand for alternatives in childbirth, and  for people to attend births at home. That  demand created the need for midwdves.  There was a women's clinic in Seattle that  started training women who had been providing general women's health care, with a  couple of physicians. These women started  doing births on their own. At that time,  no one knew there was a midwifery law on  the books. No one had been licensed under  the law since 1930. A foreign-trained  midwife from Denmark came to Seattle,  wanted to start a practice, and hired a  lawyer who figured out that there was an  old law on the books."  "She challenged the state to provide an  exam, which they did. Then, the Department  of Licensing suggested to those midwives  that were practising in the Seattle area,  that if they started a school, the school  could be approved by the State and they  could also be licensed midwives."  The school now offers a three-year course,  with the first 12 months in Seattle, and  the last part of the course working in  the field, all over the country and beyond.  The school also offers continuing education  for midwives and other health care workers.  Seattle Midwifery School,  2524 16th  Ave. South, Room 300,  Seattle,  WA 98144  (206)  322-8834. June TO Kinesis   19  ARTS  A feminist revisits Orwell's Wigan Pier  by Janie Newton-Moss  Wigan Pier Revisited  by Beatrix Campbell  Poverty and Politics in the 80s  Published by Virago  Urban Britain fifty years after George  Orwell's famous trek which resulted in  his book The Road To Wigan Pier  is documented by journalist activist Beatrix  Campbell in this 198<4 publication from  the feminist Virago Press. While Campbell  acknowledges the importance of the earlier  work, she also notes Orwell's absence of  understanding how poverty affects women.  This she sets out to rectify, hence the  book's title.  Campbell is well qualified to undertake  such an enormous task. A socialist-  feminist of long standing, she was one  of the contributors to Beyond the Fragments  as well as working as an investigative  journalist during the last two decades.  She spent six months in 1982 following  the same route as Orwell and adding  two more cities for contrast. In the  opening pages Campbell outlines one of  her reasons for starting the journey:  The last great depression took Orwell  out on the road,  on a quest for the meanings of mass poverty.  He also used his  chronicle for an assault on both the  Right and the Left:  Wigan Pier was as  much a political tract as a travelogue,  it was an indictment of the Right and  an ultimatum to the Left.  Then as now,  the paralysis of progressive institutional politics found its echo in the  threat of world war - this time would  be the last time.  The crisis of the  eighties occasions a return visit.  A return visit is long overdue. Over  the past fifty years womens' relationship to work and wages has changed  while mens' has remained constant. It  is now commonplace to find women as  the only wage earners in households  where the rest of the family is on the  dole. As Campbell points out the pattern  of unemployment is unevenly distributed.  "Sex segregation in the labour market  puts men and women in different jobs,  often in different workplaces, susceptible to different impact as the recession bites."  In one of the most interesting chapters,  "The Landscape," Campbell outlines the  relationship between housing and poverty.  Next to unemployment housing is the most  pressing concern for the majority of  people she visited. A recent social policy report suggested that 20 percent of  Britain's housing stock is unfit for human habitation, a fact born out by  Campbell's documentation. Universal housing provision was one of the tenets of  the welfare state created by the postwar government in Britain. Orwell's  voice was only one in a clamouring outcry against Victorian slums that housed  the urban poor in the thirties. Ironically Campbell fifty years on is witness to the decay of the "new" public  housing that was the result of Orwell's ,  protests.  Campbell contends that one reason for  political apathy by the poor is the lack  of control over their environment including the space called home. "There are  no safe spaces around the. flats, no  fences or shrubs, sheds or seats, to  shelter bikes, prams, washing, last  year's bulbs, or children. No places  to sit in the sun. Just nude space.  Kids rush out, only to be followed by  shouts of Wayne...Lee...Karen...come  in here..."  She argues that political activity takes  time, money and energy, all in short supply for women who are struggling below the  poverty line to survive on a daily basis.  "The poor have access to neither personal  nor political resources. Subsistence incomes leave no surplus for self-help. How  can a twenty-two-year-old mother with three  small children, whose stock of crockery con+  sists of three cups and four plates, find  the economic or emotional hardware to plug  up the six inch hole around the pipe running from her sink to an outside drain, or  similar holes round all the pipes in her  kitchen?"  Unlike other social historians, Campbell's  questions are not rhetorical. She does not  begin her search with the premise that the  poor will always be with us. As a committed  activist she poses the questions that have  largely been ignored by trade unions and  other male dominated political organisa-  - tions.  In a chapter entitled "Baths and Bosses:  the Miners" who looks over the shoulder of  the most noble of all working class heroes; "  the miners, to their community which of  course consists of women. Their community  support has enabled them to tackle their  bosses both in the pits and in parliament  which has earned them a place in socialist  folklore unparalleled by any other group  of workers. Campbell argues that the limelight should be shared by their womenfolk  who are prepared to cut the bread even  thinner when times are tough. Much of what  she-writes about miners' wives we are. somewhat familiar with as the last miners'  strike was characterised by the overwhelming amount of work undertaken by womens'  support groups who organised everything  from soup kitchens to fundraising campaigns. It is interesting to note that the  structure set up by the support groups remains intact in some areas fifteen months  after the battle was lost.  In the course of her travels Campbell met  hundreds of people who through their insights and experiences were able to help  her write this book. They are not forgot-  . ten. Her acknowledgements run to three  pages! She states in the book that the experience re-defined her alliances and particularly it confirmed her belief in women as purveyors of change. In her conclusion she states: "Most importantly, the  radicals within the working class I met  were mostly women; they were the most.reflective and imaginative, it was they who  affirmed democratic ways of working, it  ' was they who affirmed egalitarianism, it  is they who are on the move, and it is  they who are being transformed by their  own experience of change."  The Lost and Found: Vancouver  women telling their own stories  by Barbara Herringer  You are about to enter The Lost and Found.  It is no ordinary space. It holds a thousand voices, cultures and colours. It is  about our grandmothers and daughters, our  sisters, mothers and lovers. It is a land  of history and vision. It is us — the  culture of women in the city of Vancouver  for the last 100 years.  The evolution of The Lost and Found  from  isolated story to theatre presentation  has been a witch's brew of brainstorming,  fundraising, researching and imagining .-  After the astounding success of the Women and Words conference in 1983, the  launching of a bilingual anthology in 1984-,  and the founding of West Word, a summer  school for women writers, the time was  ripe to design a project that would include Vancouver women in their city's centennial. In the fall of 198/4 a small group  emerged from the Vancouver branch of Women and Words to make plans for the project and named itself "Women's Voices: A  Vancouver Mosaic".  Mosaic: Form or work of art in which pictures are produced by joining together  minute pieces of glass,  stone,   etc. of  different colours.  From the beginning, the Women's Voices mosaic was a textured and layered creation.  The experience of Vancouver women' through  the telling of their own stories, the fab- '  ric of lives and cultures during 100 years,  would be woven into a tapestry for the theatre. Not hidden in a library to be- dusted  off from time to time, it would be alive,  visible and joyous. Hardly a small task,  but the project was determined to break,  out of the perception that ignores most  of the women who made Vancouver.  Researchers papered the city with flyers ■  and gathered the stories of eighty women  who contacted them. These women and the  lives of many others through books or remembrances, became the foundation of The  Lost and Found.  The call went out for a wordsmith who  could weave these stories into a dramatic  form. Two directors came forward with an  intuitive sense of how the words would  come to life and actors from every community appeared to translate the words into  gestures and to breathe their own lives  into the characters.  The a different phase of the work began  with intense workshop sessions where actors, playwright and directors camped  around the fire of the play and like ancient crones and conjurers, transformed  the piece into new shapes, new voices.  Our piece of theatre is merely a glimpse  into the creation of The Lost and Found.  "Women's Voices: A Vancouver Mosaic" is  also presenting a series of events concurrent with the play: a lobby display in  the theatre, a herstory workshop, theatre  workshop, local history workshop and walking tour.  The Lost and Found  opens June 5 at the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre, and runs  through June 14-. For more information call  254-9578.

The large solid people in her  paintings firmly occupy their space  on the canvas, yet at the same time  have a charm and an appeal which does  .not diminish their power. We can find  these people in her current exhibit,  "Family Series: A Jewish Childhood in  Chicago" Showing throughout May at  the Art Gallery of greater Victoria  and opening June 24 at the Shalom  Gallery in Vancouver.  As we walk among the paintings we  are surrounded by members of Phyllis's  family. Some, caught up in their own  concerns, are oblivious to us as  viewers. Others calmly assess us from  the 4-4 by 60 inch canvas.  Who are they? Her grandfather, in his  long brown coat, white bearded, sits  formally in his old fashioned chair,  the blind drawn behind him. Portraitlike, he appears to be from another  generation and another world.  Some of the people are shown at mo->  ments of worship. Her father, his  back to us, recites his daily prayers  in the privacy of his bedroom. His  prayer shawl and tefillin (ritual  boxes tied to the arm for prayer) are  thrown over his undershirt. The morning light flowing in through the window illuminates him but the corners  of the room are in shadow.  Her Uncle Morris is also dressed for  prayer, but in a more public place.  He chants and sings, swaying slightly  back and forth. In his hand is an Open  prayer book at which he does not bother to glance.  Phyllis's mother lights the Sabbath  candles as her husband watches from  the doorway. Her face is hidden, but  the candle light shines on her arms  and neck as she performs this traditional woman's ritual.  Other relatives Phyllis has chosen to  depict at more social moments. Her  Aunt Jenny, flamboyant, dressed in  her best, presides over a lively card  playing table. Seated at the table  are a man who could be her husband,  and a woman in black, perhaps recently arrived from Europe.  In his fish store her Uncle Jake conducts his business. Warm, friendly,  he accepts from a young braided Phyllis  |$het package^ of cigarettes he has sent  her out to buy. lo.^#  But life also has its moments of pain.  In angry mourning, Phyllis's grandmother, who came to live with the  family when Phyllis was in her teens,  sits, cigarette in hand, almost audibly swearing and cursing at the image  of Hitler on the black and white television screen. Like a crazy old lady,  she is a bit humourous as she sits  yelling "hoodlums!" at the television  Worksite  vibrant,  exciting  by Allisa McDonald and Marlyn MacDonald  Worksite is a feminist artists collective committed to facilitating the  viewing of women artists '• work in diverse media. They have been producing  small scale multi-media events on a  volunteer basis since May 1985. On  May 15 and 16, 1986 they presented  Two Nights Working,   a cabaret of  women artists at Heritage Hall.  Two Nights Working  as a performance  piece in itself was thoughtfully  conceived, energetically staged  and enthusiastically received. Heritage Hall, with its old-fashioned  high ceilings, natural dark wood,  and stalwart pillars, provided an  appropriately solid yet funky space,  consistent with Worksite's policy  of presenting art in non-gallery  places.  The "cabaret acts" included dance,  poetry, comedy, and film which  the audience responded to with varying degrees of delight, excitement,  boredom, embarassment, disgust and  happiness, as would any cabaret audience. The audience for both evenings,  by the way, was an interesting non-mix  in her safe Chicago livingroom. But  the humour is grim for she has left  behind in Warsaw 13 sisters and brothers, all killed by the Nazis.  The colour in the paintings, the use  of light, the fact that the images  are slightly tilted, and the stories  they tell all add to the intensity of  the paintings. They are Phyllis's personal memories, and perhaps the perspective is the slightly askew intense  viewpoint of the child. But they are  by no means'bizarre. The men are presented with gentleness, the women  with a strength and a passion which  would be called feminism in later gen-  • erations. And above all they are representations of very real people, of  their thoughts, their emotions, and  their lives.  "Family Series: A Jewish Childhood in  Chicago" opens June  24 at 7:30 at the  Shalom Gallery,   950 West 41st,  and will  be showing until July 3rd. Phyllis Serota  will be speaking on her work at 8:15pm on  June 24.  of types: attractive, creatively-  dressed 25-35 year old women with a  sprinkling of men of about the same  description and a few dignified parental types in pairs. Several semi-punk  women rounded out the demographics of  this piece which was attempting to explore and present the creativity of  contemporary women artists.  A vibrant and exciting component of  this event was provided by the women  in the "background" taking tickets,  handing out programs, selling homemade  cheesecake and other exotic pastries.  These activities, strongly evocative  of women's traditional roles, provided  a positive note of continuity with  our foremothers. Representing today's  woman, and her newly discovered technical abilities, were the capable  women running the sound and light  boards and the film and slide projectors .  The overall effect was one of rich  stimulation: the independent artists  performing at the front of the room,,  the Worksite organizers with their  smiles and muscles at the back, and  all around, the participant/spectators  in their teal blues and shimmering  purples. Two Nights Working  as a multi-  textured performance event designed to  display and stimulate women's creativity was an unqualified success.

Obviously  a nerve has been touched and the knee-jerk  responses probably won't stop for a while.  We've been raised in such an adversarial  system that we have all been deeply conditioned to see things in "us/them" terms.  Women/Men. Woman vulnerable/Men the aggressive. Much of our gender bonding has  been done around efforts to combat violence  against women and children, to turn ourselves from "victim" to "survivor". Man  abuses woman, woman turns to other women,  women heal woman, ain't Sisterhood great.  Maybe we have to really examine the fact  that the subject of violence between women, violence by woman against woman,  caused such a deep split in the community,  brought forth such emotional responses.  For a start, I really question some of the  statistics; it is suggested that 97$ of  sexual abusers are men "leaving three percent as women". My. understanding of the  abuse statistics is that 97 percent of sexual abusers are heterosexual males, more  than 2 percent are homosexual males, leaving less than one percent women. For me,  the article didn't work simply because the  first paragraph got itself into deep statistical trouble.  Even so, we are afraid to look at this,  afraid to examine our own potential for  violence. Kate Millett has written and  spoken of her own horror, on investigating  a case of imprisonment-torture-and-death,  and finding the whole grisly thing organized by and around a woman. Even Kate  Millett couldn't handle what exploded in  her mind when she"was faced with the undeniable truth that we have not escaped  having our souls brutalized by the patriarchy.  A few years ago a.woman with whom I was  very marginally acquainted attacked her  lover and hurt her quite badly. The abusive  woman is very tall, stocky, and very physically strong. The woman assaulted is not  tall, and so slender she could hide behind  a fence picket. The survivor of this assault was treated to several maternalizing  lectures by other members of the women's  community because she flatly refused to  I KIDS play space  I NEW convenient location  1 HOUSEHOLD and gift ideas;  I FRESH produce-incl. organic!  *$&K    NEW'hOURS"'"^P^  ..:•   10:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.       |  ^ Open 7 days a week..

For her everything had  been said when the fist hit the flesh.  Women who would have quite willingly  marched, demonstrated, or confronted any  man who had done such a thing were more  than willing to forgive and forget it all  when the abuser was a woman. I found the  size-strength imbalance very interesting.  The abuser does not have a history of becoming pugnacious when confronted with  anyone her own size or larger! And isn't  that typical of the average male bully?  Maybe it is just typical of bullies?  I was told I was "judgemental" because  since the assault I have refused to have  .anything to do with the woman who did the  assaulting. And I will continue to ignore  her until she shows herself willing to be  publicly accountable for what happened.  Saying you didn't know how deeply you had  been affected by the patriarchy is hardly  sufficient after you have inflicted bruises  and cracked bones.  And so what is "judgemental", and why is  it presupposed that it is bad. If I hadn't  been capable of and willing to form opinions and make judgements I might still be -  singing in the Anglican choir, dedicated  to the perpetuation of the system, convinced God and all that is good is male  .and woman is cursed forever with the guilt  of the sin of Eve. If women weren't capable of being judgemental we might all still  be stuck in the fifties, living life as  pale copies of Betty Boop.  But the women's community did not want to  deal with that incidence of violence by  woman against woman, either. It terrifies  us! As long as it is just men who bash,  batter and rape, we are safe with women;  if we admit women are also capable of bashing, battering, and raping, we feel ourselves the vulnerable victim all over again,  and our doubts about our few workshops on  self defense tactics rise to the surface.  Small wonder the women who survived violence and sexual abuse at the hands of other women requested anonymity. Violence does  not have to be physical to be destructive,  and what happened when the women's community allowed an.incident of known abuse to  pass without a ripple was another assault  on the woman who was battered; emotional  assault by women who loudly proclaim their  own spirituality but who quiver at the .  thought of making a judgement, and are too  timid to leave the group long enough to  take any kind of individual personal stand.  When right wing women refuse to look at reality and continue to blather on about the  sanctity of the nuclear family, the heavenly blessing of compulsory heterosexuality,  and the general wonderfulness of this the  best of all possible systems we mourn their  Ariel  Books  Open 10-6 pm Monday  to Saturday  Sunday 1-5 pm  %,  2766 W. 4th Ave.  733-3511  fear and try to continue to work toward,  making the world a better place for all women, even the fearful and co-opted.  When women who pretend to be feminist because they perceive themselves as being  part of an advance wave do not support a  woman who has been beaten because it was  a woman who beat her, something else is  happening, and I'm still judgemental, and  I'm not bothering with them, either. They  can't be counted on when push comes to  shove and if you can't be counted on, you  aren't contributing.  It isn't enough to recoil and then pretend  it doesn't happen. It does. Not often, but  even one incedent is too many, and public  disapproval, community disapproval has  shown itself to be very effective when  dealing with men who think might makes  right.  I know I need more examination of my own  responses to violence against women by women. When I know of a man who has battered  a woman, I experience rage and have twice  in my life, on actually witnessing an assault, moved, in physically to stop him from  hitting her. It is very interesting that  both times, when faced by a tall woman  flipped half out of her (weak) mind by rage,  the man backed off and instead of bashing,  began to bluster. And when I saw a woman  sitting in my kitchen still shaking, bruised,  limping painfully, that same rage started  and had the abuser walked into the house at  that time the statistics would have taken  an upward turn. I know  I am capable of violence . The last time I took a poke at a woman I was eleven and she was thirteen, but  the fact I have chosen not to be violent  doesn't mean I'm not capable of violence.  And I don't think I am very different from  anyone else. I chose, not to beat up women.  There are some women who have chosen to  beat up women; just as some men have chosen  to do the same thing.  When women choose not to take a stand against  violence against women by women, those women  choose to be cowards; and how can anyone  make any kind of a stand if she won't examine the possibility something exists? Not  long ago it was considered quite tacky to  discuss pornography-as-evil, we were all  supposed to be liberal, and it was improper  not to parrot the line about the privacy of  the home and free choice, and the evils of  censorship.  I applaud Kinesis  for having had the courage to print an article taking the lid off  yet another Pandora's box. If we are afraid  .to speak out about violence done to us by  other women, statistics will continue to be  incomplete and to tell lies. Five years ago  virtually no  statistics were available  about sexual abuse against children. And  now...the women's movement is airing that  mess and there is help for survivors. Maybe we have to have the guts to air this  mess, too, and be publicly accountable to  ourselves. We know from our experience with  incest survivors that not  talking about it  doesn't make it go away!  Thank you for the article, I would appreciate more on the subject.  gMACPHEHgON ^MOTORS  885B.8thAve.,Van.  876-6038  BYAFPOINTMENT  CsAlicecJMaCpherSOIl licensed mechanic ARTS  Worksite from page 20  Within Two Nights Working  eleven presentations were made by eight different artists or groups of artists. Unfortunately, space does not allow for  eleven separate reviews, but each piece  deserves mention. Interesting dance  selections included: A Delicate Lust,  performed by "Comedy of Eros", who are  Trish Halsey, Janet Brook, and Debbie  Boyko; Baris,   a traditional male dance  from Bali was performed by Lorraine  Thompson; and Angela Brown did excerpts  from her solo To A Modern Venus.  Comedic  interludes were provided by Janice  Ungaro and powerful installed visual  work by Margot Butler gave us something  to contemplate during intermissions.  Angela Hryniuk read prose and a few  poems. The most impressive of which  was her most recent poem, as yet untitled, containing the lines: "This  is the kind of poem mothers hate."  Hopefully she will write more of this  "kind of poem."  The three films shown: Ten Cents A Dance  by Midi Onodera; One Woman Waiting  by  Josephine Massarella; and The Wake  by  Carolyn McLuskie, provided the highlights  of Two Nights.  Ten Cents A Dance  visually demonstrated  the inability of three modern couples—  lesbian, male homosexual, and straight—  to genuinely connect. Each partner in  each twosome is shown in her/his own  separate frame, a brilliant visual  metaphor for the self-protective and  ultimately self-defeating sexual connections between these people. Ten Cents  A Dance  is a compelling film, well worth  seeing.  One Woman Waiting  was the most cryptic  of the three films shown and the most  open to varied interpretations. A woman  enters a sandy, windy landscape and after walking around she sits and waits,  while wind blows sand on the dunes  stretched out for miles behind her.  Another similar woman eventually  appears in the far background, walks  along and through the dunes until she  is face to face with the first woman.  A token is given to the first woman.  They hug and separate. The first woman  walks off into the background dunes  and the second woman walks toward the  camera and out of the picture, leaving  the windswept dunes. The landscape is  very sensual and choreography and sound  track heighten the ritualistic nature of  the meeting. However, though the filmmaker was clearly striving for an archetypal effect, the symbolism was not very  revealing, and, in the end, the many  possible interpretations worked against  the impact of this film.  In contrast, The Wake,  by Carolyn  McLuskie had a clear theme—the grieving  process. Whereas Ten Cents A Dance  was about the sterility, separateness,  and non-involvement of modern relationships, ana One Woman Waiting  is perhaps  about connections that must be made  before one can continue life's journey,  The Wake  is about the deep and almost  intolerable pain of loss when we are  separated from another human being with  whom a true connection has been made  and sustained.  • RESIDENTIAL  • INTERIOR  • DRYWALL REPAIR  LEIGH THOMSON  251-6516  The images of The Wake  vividly portray  the emotions of grief: anger and despair,  lethargy and depression, numbness, and  finally, release and acceptance. The  viewer is drawn in by images which arouse  the emotions: A boat's bow smashing on  waves, faster and faster; blue bubbles  ascending; an ice-woman melting on the  beach. Sustained images intercut with  abrupt blackouts work like pressure-  point massage—the viewer can't help  but eventually succumb to the image and  its corresponding emotion. In The Wake  the filmmaker is stretching herself  artistically, as well as courageously  sharing emotional experiences. In every  sense of the word, The Wake  is a very  moving film. It was an appropriate finale  'to Two Nights Working.  The worksite collective and the many  volunteers who enabled Two Nights Working  are to be congratulated on their  multi-disciplinary cabaret.

Basically things are at a pretty  low level and I think that not much is  going to happen in Winnipeg until it happens elsewhere in the country.  What cities do you think will next open  up clinics?  I'm hoping that Vancouver is one city  where a clinic will open up very soon. I  think the conditions are most ripe here:  there's a strong pro-choice movement, a  strong women's movement and a pro-choice  labour movement. It's especially hopeful  if the NDP is elected as the party already  has a position in favour of clinics. So  the possibility of pressuring the NDP to  either approve or establish clinics is  much greater. I think that-BC is the most  optimistic place.  I don't think success necessarily hinges  on government. We had, in Ontario, a Conservative government which was bound and  determined to shut dpwn the clinic but  they couldn't do it once we got a jury  acquittal. That's the reality.  B.C. is the most pro-choice of all the  provinces. You've got a labour movement  June U6 Kinesis   23  which has had good positions on pro-choice  longer than any labour group in the country. You have a strong local group—   v^ ffij  stronger than we were when we started in  Ontario — you have a fairly broad women's  movement, and the left here is strong.  You don't need the government to be sympathetic to win in a clinic. We didn't have  a sympathetic government, we had a totally  hostile government.  The fact is I don't think you will find  a jury anywhere in Canada that will convict a doctor for performing abortions at  a clinic. And that's why you can win with  a clinic. Certainly it would be better  conditions if it was another government  so if there's an election expected in the  next six months then you wouldn't open a  clinic tomorrow. But I think it can be  done anyway, even with the Socreds. I al-j  so think it would be a point of mobilization. There's been so much demoralization  in the province over the defeat of Solidarity, if there could be a struggle that  there was a possibility of winning against  the Socreds I think you'd spark pretty big  mobilization here and get people much more  politicized.

Simone de Beauvoir died a number of weeks  ago at the age of seventy-eight — the  exact age at which her mother died. Originally published in the mid-sixties, A  Very Easy Death  chronicles the four weeks  during which her elder daughter's life  came to a virtual halt in order to help  care for her.  A Very Easy Death  is not a theoretical  treatise but an autobiographical coming  to terms with mortality. But de-Beauvoir  does not resign herself to the finality  of it all. She asserts instead that "there  is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for  every man his death is an accident and,  even if he knows it and consents to it,  an unjustifiable violation."  When I first read this book about ten  years ago, I allowed myself to imagine  my own mother's death. Is there anything  more traumatic for a daughter than the  loss of her mother (at whatever age)?  Mothers are the source of our lives as  well as the focus for our struggles around  the need for both autonomy and nurturance,  and as a friend of mine put it (whose  mother died fifteen years ago when my  friend was in her early twenties) the  relationship never ends. Motherless  daughters experience a void that few of  us even want to think about. The irony  of de Beauvior's title is underscored  with her every word and the work, infused with a sadness never directly addressed, is evocative and poetic.  The sight of my mother 's nakedness had  jarred me. No body existed less for me:  none existed more. As a child I had loved  it dearly; as an adolescent it had filled  me with an uneasy repulsion: all this was  perfectly in the ordinary course of things  and it seemed reasonable to me that her  body should retain its dual nature,   that  it should be both repugnant and holy -  a taboo.

She was much closer to her  father, at least intellectually. But  in a short, incisive image she manages  to crystallize not only the sexual shame  which many of us inherit from our mothers  (and the ambivalence that it fosters)  but also the essential, problematic primacy of the mother:  Now as I re-read A Very Easy Death,  I wonder at Simone de Beauvoir's  own death just a short while ago  and wonder if she cursed our temporal existence or resigned quietly, perhaps thinking of her mother.

Onlywomen Press Ltd.  38 Mount Pleasant,  London WCL  Order from Inland Book Company  22 Hemingway Avenue    East Haven,  East Haven,   CT 06512  There are at least three good reasons  to subscribe to this new journal.  The first is its origin in women's  discussion groups in London during  the winter of 8-4/85 in which lesbians  discussed various aspects of lesbian  ethics. {The Radical Reviewer  was  born because a group of Vancouver  lesbians sat around talking literature and politics. I love the way  women's need for serious discussions  gets translated into print.) Anna  Livia tells me that these discussions  were so popular that each session  was repeated and a conference on  lesbian/feminist ethics organized  in March of this year saw, "all  the rooms packed to over-capacity."  Another reason is spelt Julia Penelope  who in Gossip's  first issue reprints  part one of her three-part essay,  "The Mystery of Lesbians", which  originally appeared in a new American  journal Lesbian Ethics  (P.O. Box 94-3  Venice CA 90294- Vol. 1, numbers 1,  2, & 3). The essay surveys the trends  within the women's movement toward  humanism and coalition politics  which Penelope argues is to the  detriment of and in open hostility  towards lesbians. The essay is hardhitting and articulates the lesbian  separatist position with clarity  and honesty. It's been awhile since  I read an essay which had me mentally  scanning the past fifteen years for  clues as to how I have changed politically, making me both uneasy and excited.  The third reason is an essay on motherhood, or more accurately non-motherhood,  by Sheila Shulman. The title will have  many readers who are concerned about  the baby boom In the lesbian community  flipping pages with enthusiasm.

Transition House  worker disappointed  Kinesis:  I am writing to address several issues  related to the closure of Vancouver  Transition House. I want to express my  disappointment with the Kinesis  coverage.  'The defeat of the BCGEU'application before  the Labour Relations Board (LRB) effectively closing the only full government-funded  transition house in the province, represents an important event for women in B.C.  Reviewing the history and placing this decision in a historical context is critical  for helping readers understand the insidious nature of the LRB ruling'.  As a Transition House worker who selected  to pursue the fight to maintain the service  through the union and the LRB, I would have  liked your coverage to have reflected a more  collaborative view. Instead I'm left with a  sense that there were those who fought for  the House and those who did not. This denies  my reality and that of my co-workers.  Finally, I was startled by the letter from,  the Rape Relief worker which appeared in  last month's Kinesis.  Her presentation of  the manner in which per diem funded transition houses and transition house workers  function in relation to "the system" is totally erroneous. This lack of understanding,  and the methods and techniques employed by  Rape Relief in their work with women, has  long been of concern to Vancouver Transtion  House workers.  While some individual Rape Relief workers  may have been involved in the occupation,  I take comfort in the idea that their col-  .lective ideology would not have permitted  a committed participation.  Donna Clay  Transition House  letter disturbing  Kinesis:  I am responding to a letter in the May '86  issue of Kinesis  written by Bonnie Agnew of  Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter  Collective.  I was very disturbed and disheartened to  read what amounted to a trashing in the  feminist press of the many, many women  working in transition houses in B.C. and  an aggrandizing account of how wonderful  Rape Relief is.  In stating "Many shelters choose to take the  per diem rather than close their doors," Ms.  Agnew gives the impression that shelters not  only in the Lower Mainland but throughout  B.C. who accept per diem funding are selling  out. The Society of Transition Houses (BC/  Yukon) recognizes that in accepting per diem  funding one accepts some conditions upon  that acceptance. We further recognize that  in some transition houses the woman's length  of stay can be shorter than in others. There  are also discrepancies in the amount of money a woman receives from the Ministry of Human Resources comforts allowance in some  transition houses.  The Society of Transition Houses has recently met with the Minister of Human Resources,  Jim Neilsen, to discuss those and other concerns we have and hope to, through dialogue  and a willingness to be accountable, further  increase better services to battered women  in this province. For Rape Relief to suggest  that in every transition house who accepts  per diem funding the woman must pay for  everything else besides rent, food and utility costs is false. In many houses clothing,  transportation, baby food and diapers are  included at no cost to the woman.  Ms. Agnew fruther states that "women who are  ineligible for welfare are welcome at our  shelter." This statement gives the impression that women who aren't eligible for welfare are unwelcome and unable to stay in  transition houses who have per diem contracts with M.H.R. This is blatantly untrue and I question the reasoning and the  motive behind such a statement.  Elsewhere in their letter Rape Relief  states their belief in volunteer labour.  The Society of Transition Houses believes  that empowering women is one of the most  important aspects of transition houses  apart from offering safety and shelter away  from violence. One avenue of accomplishing  this is by example. To show women that women's labour is important and viable and  thus worthy of a pay cheque by working for  wages is to empower them by example. To  suggest that working for free is the only  viable alternative is grossly insulting,  not only to the many paid transition house  workers but to all  women who work for  wages.

In further conversations with Laurel at  the Womens Centre there, she has come' to  agree with me that hotels just may be-one  of the answers for women in the area. That  is, hotels owned and operated by women,  for women. Such residential hotels would  meet the basic requirements for safety and  community, and could offer a lot more. I  like to hear from women interested in  investing in such a vital project.

No charges were laid,- and Jessie was released to return to FEDTRAW, her home and  family. I thought you may appreciate knowing the outcome of Jessie's visit, since  we were quite concerned about repercussions of the tour.  The Federation of Transvaal Women also  sent word that it was happy with the contacts made with women's groups during the  tour. Jessie sends her regards.  For follow-up to work on South African women's issues generated during the spring,  women involved in the tour hope to organize a premiere of the new Winnie Mandela  film in September. We'll inform you of  progress of the event, and of course, welcome any participation.  Thank you again for your support for the  women of South Africa.
