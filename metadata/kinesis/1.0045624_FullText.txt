The most incredible thing about the  anti-APEC organizing was that it kept  growing and growing and the base of opposition just kept getting broader and  broader.  In this issue oiKinesis, we highlight some  oftheactrvismtlrathappenedinVancouverduring  the APEC Summit mainly because the build-up  of momentum as the November days progressed  was so tremendous.  Certainly in Vancouver, the National Women's Day of Protest Against APEC piqued the  interest of more women than any other campaign women here have seen in a while.  Part of the success of the campaign was  connected to fhegovemmenfs—atalllevels—deliberate silencing of what was being discussed  behind the closed-door meetings of bureacrats,  heads of state and big business interests. This  caused women to welcome and even seek out  any information that answered or validated their  questions about what APEC was really about  The mobilization of women in Vancouver,  which rippled into other communities, came to  life as women began to pull together all the  threads of their lives and find their links back to  Legal aid cuts-APEC, national debt-APEC,  increased part-time work for women-APEC, vio-  lerKeagainstwcmen-APECitdidn'tmatterwhat  the issue was, the Lower Mainland Feminist Net-  workingGroup whichinitiated the Women's Day  of Protest campaign, continued to send home  the message that the slide further to the Right  in terms of the social, political and economic  vision in this country had to do with profiteering  and misplaced priorities.  The well-being of women, indigenous peoples, immigrants, young people, older people..are  notthepriority of our governments. No, they are  much more concerned with the best interests of  corporations and wealthy elites.  Throughout its organizing, women involved in the FNG kept talking to each  other and to women they'd meet on the bus,  or on the street, or at a friend's  place...wherever. The challenge was in trying out different ways to communicate  clearly how APEC impacts on women's  lives. With nurses, feminists talked about  cuts to healthcare and privatization; with  Aboriginal women, feminists talked about  the BC treaty process and the pitting of off-  reserve and on-reserve Aboriginal peoples  against each other; with artists, feminists  talked about the commodification of culture and art; and so on.  As more and more women saw the relevance of APEC to their lives, it became  easier to find common bases for discussing issues that, in fact, affect us all.  It also became easier to shift the discussion away from a solely "human rights"  focus to the broader issues of social, political and economic justice, and alternatives  to the current tide of global economic restructuring. Rather than allow APEC to be  framed as an Asian-thing, feminists  reframed the debate so that the involvement and complicity of countries like  Canada and the US were made clear.  One FNG spokesperson approached a  journalist with the Washington Post and  handed him materials on the National  Women's Day of Protest. In the interview  that ensued, he seemed genuinely surprised  that she was talking about how the slashing of social programs in Canada and the  proposed dumping of nuclear waste on  Western Shoshone territory (in Nevada)  were all a result of the APEC agenda.  One thing feminists must be more  aware of is the connection between the  APEC agenda are the recent currency and  financial crises that hit a number of Asian  nations, including Thailand, South Korea  and Japan.  While right-wing commentators have  remarked that economic difficulties in these  countries happened despite APEC, we need  to point out these very difficulties happened because o/APEC  The pro-pro-business climate being  created by trade liberalization agreements  only further opens up the possibilities that  large investors can bring down a nation's  economy by pulling out when they see fit.  Essentially, investors are being told that: "If  you want to make a buck, there's a buck to  be made."  In a way, no one should be surprised  by these recent events. Remember what  happened after NAFTA was signed? The  Mexican peso and economy went crashing  down. This allowed multinational corporations and imperialist governments like  the US to step into a stronger position from  which to dictate Mexico's social and economic policies and its people.  Women active in anti-APEC organizing say they are determined to ensure that  those links are not lost, now that theAPEC  Summit is over. The fight against corporate  globalization is nowhere near an end as  both the Multilateral Agreement on Investments and the Free Trade Agreement of the  Americas are still very much on the table.  The MAI is being called a "Corporate  Charter of Rights," which should strike fear  into the hearts of all of us. The implications  of the MAI for women in Canada are even  worse than APEC, namely because the MAI  is an actual formal agreement.  The MAI intends to do away with all  tariff and trade barriers and disallow subsidy, grant and aid programs national governments provide to support the activities  of their citizens. Corporations, in turn, will  have the right to sue national governments  if they believe they've been discriminated  against.  One of the scariest components of the  MAI is the proposed liberalizing of financial markets. This will give investors (of the  wealthier sort) and financial institutions  even more leeway to jump from country to  country in search of greater profits.  Given the recently announced profit  levels of the five major banks in Canada,  one wouldn't think they needed any extra  help in increasing their cash flow.  Yes, another year, another record broken for the Royal Bank, Band of Montreal,  Toronto Dominion, Scotia Bank and CIBC  What is their new collective mark: $7 billion, with each of them beating their own  individual records of last year.  Before we sign off, back to APEC for  one final comment: the Canadian public  should demand that our governments account for the gross amount of money spent  on hosting the one-week affair. Interestingly—but not surprisingly—the Reform  Party remained very quiet as millions and  millions flew out of the federal coffers. (This  is the same party that usually screams if  even $5 is spent on social programs.) Obviously, Reform is trying to give us a clear  sign of whose side of the bed it sleeps on.  That's all for this month as Kinesis (finally) goes to press. Have a great rest of  the year and an even better start to 1998.  And now for our monthly weather report inside Kinesis: In November, we weathered heavy APEC storms, marked by extremely sunny periods of organizing and  unprecedented activism on the streets of  Vancouver. Nationally, APEC also cost us  recurring earthquakes, totalling $60 billion  on the Richter scale, annoying Canadian  taxpayers everywhere.  Another effect of APEC and the enormous amount of energy and resources that  women put into educating each other about  its nasty effects was to it tie up the energy  of Kinesis volunteers and staff (APEC took  place during our regular December/Jan  uary 1998 production week). Due to anti-  APEC organizing, we put off production  by one week.  This issue of Kinesis was then further  delayed by illness (editor Agnes Huang had  the flu and desktop publisher Swee Sim Tan  was hospitalized with pneumonia.)  More setbacks came in the form of vicious virus attacks on our computers, resulting in the loss of our ability to access e-  mail (where some articles still languish)  and the loss of several edited articles awaiting lay-out, which then had to be re-typed  and re-edited.  This combination in factors is what led  to our unprecedented lateness in getting  this issue to you. Our apologies!  Stepping in to take over desktop publishing from a still recovering Swee Sim was  Sur Mehat, Kinesis' typesetter and advertising coordinator. Also putting enormous  energy into filling the gaps were the editorial board and Kelly Haydon, who has been  a very active volunteer with Kinesis for the  past several months. A big thank you to all!  We'd like to welcome new voices in this  month's issue, a couple of whom are international activists who were in town for the  2ndInternational Women's Conference  Against APEC: Sarojeni Rengam, Yayori  Matsui, Russel Baskin, Sharon Bray and  Janet Ilin Mou.  And finally, the Kinesis and Vancouver  Status of Women offices will be closed for  the month of December. We will re-open  again on January 5th.  We'd like to wish our readers the an  energetic, inspiring..in fact, tremendous  new year! Thank you for the support in  1997 and enjoy this issue of Kinesis. We'll  be back, refreshed and energized with our  February issue next year, and hope you'll  be there too!

In the centrespread interview with  Cenen Bagon on the 2nd International  Women's Conference Against APEC, we  incorrectly stated that the Manila Peo  ple's Summit was part of the official  APEC Summit, when instead it was parallel to it. Also in that same article, Bagon  is quoted saying, "We are putting a lot  of effort and resources into supporting  Aboriginal women and their organizing." In fact, she did not mean to imply  that support is already being done but  rather that that support is in preliminary  stages. Hence, the sentence should read:  "We are going to put...."  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 News  The murder of Reena Virk:  The erasure of race  by Yasmin Jiwani  November 14th marks the day when  14-year old Reena Virk was severely beaten,  brutalized, and drowned in Saanich, British Columbia just outside of Victoria. The  cause, according to newspaper accounts,  was that she was "an overweight teen" who didn't fit in.  In the initial reports, seven  girls and one boy were allegedly responsible for her death.  The unfolding coverage of the  event initiated a moral panic,  with public calls for a more  stringent approach by the  criminal justice system to dealing with youth violence. Since  then, six girls and one boy have  been charged with the murder  of Reena Virk.  As the events leading to  Virk's murder unfolded in the  daily papers and television  newscasts, the horror of what  "girls do to other girls" was  highlighted. It quickly overshadowed coverage of male violence. In  contrast to the numerous deaths of women  by their spouses and ex-spouses, Reena's  death was held up as symbol of how girls  are not immune to being violent.  Story after story in the daily media covered the issue of teen-girl violence, quoting research to support the main contention that girls are just as dangerous as boys.  Even though existing research clearly links  teen-girl violence to the internalization of  a dominant, patriarchal culture which values sex and power, this connection was  trivialized, if not side-stepped altogether.  But "bad girls" have never fitted in.  Unlike stories of male violence against  women which tend to be address this violence as aberrant and singular, news stories focusing on Reena Virk quickly mentioned other related cases of girl violence  across the country. Statistics confirming the  rising incidence of girl violence were repeatedly stressed to emphasize in effect that  girls are no different from boys. The overall message was that this is an epidemic and  something needs to be done about it.  And, the implicit yet compelling message was that gender-based violence no  longer exists within the younger generation.  Headlines from The Vancouver Sun  screamed: "Teenage girls and violence: The  BC Reality," "Girls fighting marked by insults, rumours, gangs," "Bullies: Dealing  with threats in a child's life," "Girls killing  girls a sign of angry, empty lives," the last  headline suggesting that had girls followed  a traditional (gender-based) lifestyle, their  lives would not be so empty and frustrating.  Throughout, the media dwelled with  puzzlement on the increasing violence of  teenage girls at a time when girls are supposedly enjoying greater access to education. Statistics indicating the growing  number of girls graduating with honours  (compared to boys) were used to demonstrate this perplexing contradiction.  Reena Virk was  killed by those  who considered  her difference  an affront to  their sense of  uniformity.  Implicit throughout was the sense that  girls can't possibly to be violent because of  the privileges they are now enjoying. But  at the same time, an explanation advanced  suggests that girls are not used to the demands inherent  in these privileges,     can't  cope and hence  become violent.  At no time  has the media  provided any  in-depth analysis of  t h  e  violent  nature  of our  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   domi-  nant  culture,  or examined ways in which violent behaviour is internalized as a function of coping within a violent society.  Feminists have long argued  that violence is about power and  dominance. Understood this  way, male violence against  women is viewed as a direct outcome of the unequal power and  control that males exercise in society. In Reena Virk's case, these  same notions of power and  dominance are rendered invisible by the media. Instead, any  reference to unequal power relations is subsumed within the  frame of "the girl who tried desperately to fit in but couldn't."  Reena Virk couldn't "fit in"  because she couldn't possibly  have. She was brown in a pre-~  dominantly white society. She  was supposedly "overweight"  in a society which values slim-  ness to the point of anorexia.  And she was different in a society which values 'sameness'  and uniformity.  She was killed by those  who considered her difference  an affront to their sense of uniformity. Their power and dominance, legitimized by and  rooted in the sexism and racism of the dominant white culture and its attendant sense of  superiority, was used to force  her into submission—a submission that amounted to her  death and erasure from society.  In the public presentation  of her murder, Reena suffered  yet another erasure. While the daily papers  plastered her picture on the front and back  pages, no mention, save one, was made that  Reena Virk died because of racism. Instead,  stories repeatedly stress her lack of fit and  her overweight appearance. The implicit  message is that had she been white and  thin, she would have fitted in and there  would have been no reason for her to be  killed. This combination of race and gender factors is a toxic mix and a warning to  all who don't "fit" that you get what you  deserve.  But the erasure of race/culture is all  the more interesting in light of the media's  obsession with culture in the mass killing  of the Gakhal and Saran families in Vernon  in 1996. There, despite repeated statements  to the contrary by the Coalition of South  Asian Women Against Violence, the media  continued to emphasize the cultural background of the murdered victims. In  Reena    Virk's  ^"''MB.C.MU^;  In contrast to the members of the  Gakhal and Saran families, Reena's family  is identified as being Jehovah's Witnesses.  Interestingly, the eulogy delivered by one  of the Church elders was used to emphasize Virk's supposedly deviant character.  Reena Virk didn't fit in. She had "alleged" incidents of sexual abuse from her  father. The Jehovah Witness elder who delivered the eulogy carefully recounted how  Reena had recanted these allegations, and  had in fact made up the allegations in order to obtain personal freedom. She had  subsequently been moved to a foster home.  Not once did the papers mention the  pressures she faced, nor did the papers consider the research on child sexual  abuse and  SOUNDS  to>  7/^/:  ,U0:A  '■/S  Slain  ofab\  story however, the coverage makes no mention of her cultural background even though she is clearly South  Asian. Could this absence be due to the fact  that she was not killed by one of her own?  the   reasons why  children  recant "allegations"  of sexual  abuse.  In  Reena Virk,  the sexism  and racism  of the dominant society  found a victim that fit  all its stereotypes.   Yet  her erasure in  the    public  world marks  Virk as a double symbol of  jeopardy   to  young South  . Asian girls —  that they had  better fit in or  find other ways  of survival, if  they are to continue to live in  •    the white, patriarchal culture of  contemporary  Canadian society.  Ultimately,  what happened  to  Reena   Virk  could have happened   to   any  number of us who  are visibly different and doubly or  triply marked in  this society by virtue of race, gender,  sexual orientation  and disability.  Yasmin Jiwani is the  coordinator of  FREDA, the Feminist  Education, Develop  ment and Action Centre on violence against  women and children in Vancouver.  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 News  Violence against women in Canada:  Photos tell the true story  by Russel Baskin  "I never used to be scared to go out on  the street. I never used to be like this. It's  got much worse. I usually just stay in at  night. Guys get desperate for money for  drugs so they rob you. If I do go out I have  someone with me and I don't take my  purse." Beverley Nelson, volunteer at the  Downtown Eastside Women's Centre  December 6th is Canada's National  Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. In June 1991, in  memory of the 14 women murdered at  Montreal's L'Ecole Polytechnique, Bill C-  202-declaring the National Day-was  passed unanimously in the House of Commons.  This "official" recognition was supposed to help further the work of ending  violence against women, but still, even today, most of the public seems unaware of  this day or the critical situation of violence  against women. And it appears that the federal government believes that by making  one day of the year "significant," they've  done enough towards ending violence  against women.  Three years ago, Vancouver art activist Rita Beiks went into action, taking on  the mainstream medias in an attempt to get  them to acknowledge December 6th. What  she found in the process was a conscious  decision by those with editorial control not  to give it much mention. Each year, fewer  acknowledgements of December 6th are  made by the corporate media.  This discovery did not deter her efforts.  On the contrary, she became more determined to continue. Beik's drive comes from  being a witness herself to domestic violence  in her family and later becoming a victim  of sexual harassment. This, combined with  her desire to challenge violence against  women, culminated in a variety of art actions.  For one of her December 6th art actions, Beiks and several friends inserted  four additional pages into Globe and Mail  newspapers throughout the downtown  Vancouver area. Beiks wrote and produced  the insert, with her own funds, to look like  it was part of the newspaper's business  section. But on closer inspection, the pages  where filled with facts and stories about  violence against women.  Encouraged by the response she received from women who contacted her to  show their support, Beiks began planning  her 1997 project, a series of photo workshops with women to highlight the issue  of violence against women. Beiks applied  for government funding, and after considering her proposal for a community public  art project, the City of Vancouver gave Beiks  a $5000 grant.  Beiks then contacted the Downtown  Eastside Women's Centre because, she says,  "I wanted to work with a group of women  directly affected by violence and whose  voices are often hidden, ignored and forgotten."  Christine Hutchinson, who works at  the centre and also participated in the  project, says, "The women here are often  trapped, victimized first by their partners  or strangers and then re-victimized by the  police and services which are meant to help  them." She added/'This happens in a way  which never happens to middle class  women. The women here are supposed to  tolerate the abuse, expect it because of who  they are or what they do or how they cope.  It is really sad to see."  So Beiks, with the help of her sister  Alona who is a publicist, began to collaborate with the women in the Downtown  Eastside community. The project was  started in August with three workshops  held at the Women's Centre, in which the  women from the community talked about  their interest in the project and exchanged  stories about their lives.  Nine women took part in the art  project. Through workshops, discussions  and photo shoots, the project came to life.  By the end of three weeks, hundreds of  photos had been taken-there were pictures  of friends and of strangers.  The week after the women had completed their photo shoots, the group came  together and looked through all the photographs. From that, one photo was selected  and enlarged into a bus shelter poster. In  addition, 30 photos were chosen and arranged as a slide show with accompanying text telling the story of the project, the  women's own processes, and how the photos represent their main concerns and issues.  The slide show is being shown  throughout December in Vancouver at the  Fifth Avenue Cinemas. Later, it will be  moved to a Vancouver Art Gallery before  going on tour across Canada.  The bus shelter poster displays the  words "She Counts" printed on the top and  a reference to December 6th on the bottom.  It will appear on 25 bus shelters in Vancouver and at the Vancouver Public Library  during the month of December.  Beiks says she asked for bus shelter  space located all around Vancouver, and  not just those concentrated in the Downtown Eastside, so that the message would  reach people from other communities. The  women involved in the project say they  wanted to get across to more people what  was happening in the Downtown Eastside.  Kinesis had the opportunity to speak  to three of them-Hutchinson, Nelson and  Julie Cyr-about their involvement with the  project.  Cyr began by saying, "When I went to  the first meeting I wondered how we were  going to achieve this. Rita explained we  would be given cameras to take pictures  out in the community. It was scary but exciting. I love taking pictures."  Hutchinson echoed those sentiments.  "I was excited to have a camera in my hand,  so I could take pictures of some of the people I know around here and show them as  people I really respect and value and some  who I have come to love."  Each woman was given a disposable  camera and asked to photograph what they  saw in their community. Nelson said she  was fascinated to see something else other  than drugs and drunk people on the streets.  She began to see some beauty in her surroundings.  Hutchinson talked about taking pictures in the Portland hotel (a rooming  house), on the streets, and at Oppenheimer  Park. What she saw was a community that  is hurting because of businesses and  gentrification moving in. "Our community  needs help, consideration and compassion," says Hutchinson.  When Hutchinson saw her pictures,  she said she felt empowered. She experienced magic in her artistry which she didn't  know she had. At the same time,  Hutchinson said she felt something really  constructive was happening, something  which might reach out to other people.  For Cyr, taking photos and seeing the  results made her feel more confident in  approaching strangers and asking to take  their pictures. She says that a picture that  stands out in her mind is of a woman she  didn't even know. The woman told Cyr she  was a survivor of a vicious attack which  almost killed her. She showed Cyr the scars  and asked her to take a picture.  "I thought, this is something I've captured that's good because maybe there are  other people who will come out and say,  'I'm a survivor too' and not be ashamed  and not be afraid," Cyr said.  When Nelson thinks about the project,  she says she hopes it will begin a lot of  changes. "I know it won't just happen overnight but I would like us to be able to walk  on the street and not be afraid. I know that  sounds like an impossible thing," she says.  Hutchinson thinks her own vision of  humanity may be idealistic, but believes  this is the way it is supposed to be and people have just gotten lost. She hopes the  project will result in more people from  outside of the Downtown Eastside community discovering things they have to offer  this area. "Perhaps it will lead to one counsellor, one lawyer or one supermarket cashier coming down and devoting their time  and reaching out to the people here,"  Hutchinson says.  The poster for the bus shelters was  launched on December 4 at the Downtown  Eastside Women's Centre. As well as the  women who participated in the project and  others from the community, guests at the  launch included former MP Dawn Black,  who was the instigator of Bill C-202.  Cyr says she hopes the exhibition and  poster will make people in all walks of life  think. "It doesn't matter where women are.  The violence is everywhere. It could happen to the elite or where we are situated  down here. Unfortunately that's the scary  part." Like so many other women Cyr finds  it unbelievable that the violence is still going on. "This is the 90s and women are sick  of it."  Russel Baskin is an artist and teacher. She met  and got to know Rita Beiks while they were  both at Emily Can Institute of Art and Design. Baskin has joined Beiks in her early hour  actions on December 6th for the past two years.  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Public pension system in Canada:  Going...  News  by Kathleen Jamieson  going...  Canada's public pension system now  appears to be in the process of reverting to  the situation of almost half a century ago  when a public pension was based on a  means test and a woman was considered a  dependent of her husband. This meant she  was not entitled to an old age pension that  recognized her as an individual in her own  right.  Currently, the two pillars of the Canada's public pension system, the Old Age  Security (OAS) and the Canada Pension  Plan (CPP), are undergoing fundamental  changes. The Liberal government's amendments to the CPP are before the Senate, after having been pushed through the House  of Commons with little debate.  These amendments are seen by many  progressive analysts as having substantial  and adverse impacts on women, people  with disabilities, and low income earners  [see Kinesis July/  August 1997.]  The  Vancouer-based  Public Pension Information Network (PPIN) has  been involved at  several levels in  trying to influence  the federal government to elimi-'  nate or at least  moderate the  changes to the  CPP that will be  most harmful to  women and those  with low incomes.

In Under the existing system, women  fact, Canada had made some progress (al-     have separate entitlement to the OAS and  have come to see this as a recognition of  though slow) toward a pension system  which was somewhat fairer to those most  in need.  One important indicator of that  seemed to be that the percentage of elderly  women living on their own with incomes  below the Statistics Canada poverty line  had declined to 53 percent. This was down  substantially from the early 1980s when  pensions had come under a good deal of  public scrutiny and the "feminization of  poverty" had become the catch phrase.  their contribution to society through their  years of unpaid work as mothers,  caregivers and volunteers.  The federal government is proposing  to bring in a bill in the new year that will  change the old age pension into a new package called the Seniors Benefit. The current  low income supplement to the OAS called  the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)  will be merged with the OAS under the new  scheme.  The Seniors Benefit will incorporate the  means-tested GIS for people with low incomes and a lower threshold for taxing  back the pension benefit from others. Under this complicated regime, entitlement to  old age pension benefits currently paid to  all individuals over 65 and taxed back only  from those in the upper income brackets  will be based on "family" income and taxed  back from both those in the middle and upper income levels.  A major step backward for women's  rights is that the incomes of a senior man  and woman assumed to be living together  will be assessed together. One outcome will  be that if a man has a high income, his senior spouse's (or cohabiting woman's)  right to old age pension benefits will no  longer exist.  Although the federal government has  said that both spouses  may still receive pension cheques in their  own names, a woman's individual entitlement will disappear if she is living  with a man. And if he  has a high income,  neither will receive a  seniors benefit  cheque. Women will  be left even more dependent on their male  partners.  In October, members of the federal finance committee held  photo by Jehn Starr an invitation-only  "consultation" in Vancouver on the Seniors  Benefit. There, they were asked how it  would be determined that a senior man and  woman in the same household were cohabiting, and therefore should be assessed together. Would it be like the infamous "man-  in-the-house rule" where women on social  assistance have to prove they are not intimate with a man living under the same  roof, who would therefore (according to the  government's reasoning) be considered financially responsible for the woman? They  did not answer the question.  This past summer, some members of  the PPIN met with British Columbia's minister of women's equality, Sue Hammell, to  ask for her assistance in conducting public  education on the Liberal government's  changes to the public pension system and  their adverse effects on women. PPIN also  asked Hammell to conduct a provincial  gender c-;nalysis (as had also been requested  in Saskatchewan), and to obtain a copy of  the federal government's gender analysis  of its CPP changes.  This analysis had been promised to  PPIN by the Hedy Fry, secretary of state  responsible for the status of women, at a  meeting in March. However, no document  was forthcoming.  Indeed, despite Fry's insistence that it  existed, no one working on the pension issue, outside of government, had ever seen  such a document...until two months ago.  Sue Hammell finally did receive a copy  of the document from Hedy Fry, which she  then passed on to members of PPIN along  with a copy of her letter to Fry criticizing  the analysis. PPIN then distributed the  document to people back in Ottawa, including opposition members of parliament  who themselves had never seen it.  It is clear why this document was suppressed by the federal government. As status of women minister, Fry must have been  embarassed by it. The federal government's  CPP gender analysis is superficial in its  content and based on a number of false  premises and platitudes about women's  lives. Its whole purpose seems to be to justify the changes to the CPP that adversely  impact on women. Not surprisingly, the  document has no name attached to it identifying who conducted the research.  Perhaps the people most excited by the  changes to the CPP and OAS/GIS are those  with a vested interest in the stock market,  which is going to receive a massive infusion of capital. The changes the Liberals  want to bring in are moves toward privatizing the public pension system, forcing  more reliance on RRSPs (which few women  can buy) and private pensions, and imposing income tests.  What can women do? The proposed  changes to the CPP may contravene the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and we  might want to challenge it on those  grounds. In the meanwhile, we also need  to continue refuting the Reform Party's  position that the CPP as a public, shared-  risk program should be abolished.  In two years, the CPP will be up for  review again. (The new legislation includes  a provision that the CPP will be reviewed  every three years instead of every five  years). It is critical that women keep ourselves informed about its impact and be  better prepared to argue more effectively  for a public pension system based on equity and fairness.  Ed. note: As Kinesis goes to press, Conservative members of the Senate agreed to allow the CPP legislation to pass, but under one  condition. The Liberal government had to withdraw from the bill the portion relating to the  establishment of a government-appointed investment board. The board would have the authority to invest a percentage of monies coming into the CPP fund from employer/employee  contributions on the stock market.

CRIAW honours  feminist researchers  At its recent conference in Fredericton,  New Brunswick in November, the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women (CRIAW) presented its annual awards honouring women for their  contributions to feminist research in  Canada.  Among the recipients was Lorraine  Greaves who was given the "The Laura  Jamieson Prize" for her book Smoke Screen:  Women's Smoking and Social Control, published by Halifax's Fernwood Publishing  in 1996. Greaves is the former director of  the Centre for Research on Violence Against  Women and Children in London, Ontario.  She recently moved to Vancouver to become the director of the BC Centre for Excellence in Women's Health.  Smoke Screen provides an important  analysis of the impact of the tobacco industry on women's lives, and first-hand accounts of what smoking means to women.  The prize is awarded for the best non-fiction book by a feminist author which advances knowledge and/or understanding  of women's experience.  Cheryl Aucoin, chair of Nova Scotia's  Women Unlimited, was awarded the "The  Muriel Duckworth Award" for her contributions over many years in the areas of:  women and the economy; women organizing for change; child care; violence against  women; fairness in funding and community outreach. And Penni Mitchell of  Herizons, a woman's quarterly published  out of Winnipeg, was acknowledged for her  regular column in the Winnipeg Free Press.  Founded in 1976, CRIAW is a national  non-governmental organization whose  purpose is to encourage, coordinate and  diffuse research into women's experience.

[information from EGALE e-listj  Global action plan on  breast cancer  At the World Conference on Breast  Cancer, held July 13-17,1997 in Kingston,  Ontario, more than 1,000 people from 54  countries began work on a Global Action  Plan to Eradicate Breast Cancer. The organizers are calling for volunteers to get involved in the Action Plan, as well as in the  planning of the next conference to be held  in Ottawa in July 1999.  Almost half of the delegates to the  Kingston conference were women living  with breast cancer. The main goal of the  conference was to emphasize an activist  agenda for change and organizers say that  the conference was unique in its grassroots  organization. This was the first time that  the voices of those most affected by cancer  took centre stage.  Many of those voices pointed to an  environmental explanation for the 70 percent of breast cancers which are not associated with known risk factors. The environmental connection, highlighting the role of  pesticides, organochlorines, estrogen-mimicking chemicals and other pollutants in the  global breast cancer epidemic, was made  by many speakers, including Women's  Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) president Bella Abzug: "Our  bodies, our breasts should not be toxic  waste dumps".

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 What's News  compiled by Kelly Haydon  Women's reproductive  rights upheld  On October 31, the Supreme Court of  Canada ruled that courts don't have the  power to force a pregnant woman to undergo treatment to prevent "harm" to her  fetus.  The SCC decision, upholding women's  reproductive rights, referred to a Winnipeg  judge's ruling that ordered a 22-year old  Aboriginal woman, known as Ms. G, into  treatment for drug addiction [see Kinesis  October 1996.] The Manitoba Court of Appeal subsequently overturned the order.  Not satisfied, the Winnipeg Child and  Family Services appealed the case further  to the highest court.  The Supreme Court's ruling reaffirms  a woman's right to fundamental liberties,  saying in effect, that a woman has the right  to control her own body at all times, including when she is pregnant.  Jo Dufay of CARAL (Canadian Abortion Rights Action League) says, "This ruling sends a clear message. Pregnant women  are free to seek medical care without fear  of incarceration." She notes that the threat  of incarceration would drive women-at-  risk away from seeking pre-natal care, with  potentially serious consequences.  Annette Garm of Sheway, a health  clinic for high-risk pregnant women living  in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver,  says it is ridiculous to believe "that forcing  a woman into legislated treatment will effect positive changes. It assumes drug treatments centres and prisons are safe, free  from drugs being readily available. They  are not." (Ms. G had sought treatment at  one point, but was turned away because of  lack of space.)  Most importantly, Garm notes, legislated treatment fails to aknowledge the historical context for substance abuse." She  questions: "why are poor, single mothers  continuing to be held responsible for all the  sins of the deteriorating social fabric."  At the Supreme Court, a number of  groups made presentations on behalf of  women's rights, including: the Women's  Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF),  CARAL, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Women's Health Clinic, Inc. in  Winnipeg, the Native Women's Transition  Centre in Winnipeg, and the Metis Women  of Manitoba, Inc. (Several anti-choice  groups also had intervenor status.) in the  case.)  The Canadian Society of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists made a public policy  statement saying that forcing women to  receive medical treatment is ethically and  medically wrong, and represents a violation of their autonomy.  Legal experts say that provinces, which  have jurisdiction over health, could still  bring in legislation allowing the forced intervention into pregnant women's lives and  decisions. However, such legislation could  be challenged on grounds of unconstitutionally, and this most recent SCC ruling  gives that argument even more weight.  In the same week the SCC decision  came down, South Carolina's highest court  upheld the criminal prosecution of pregnant women who used drugs. Cornelia  Whitner was sentenced to eight years in  prison after her baby was born with traces  of cocaine in the baby's system.  [Information from Pro-choice Press Autumn 1997 and other press releases and news  clippings]  Breast implant class  action derailed  Only eight of 1800 breast implanted  women in Louisiana who are suing Dow  Chemical Co. for damages in a class action  suit will be allowed to continue their case.  Although a jury previously agreed  with the women that Dow Chemical had  plotted to hide the health dangers of silicone from women, a state court judge ruled  that the women's cases were "too dissimilar to group them all in one lawsuit."  The women had received various types  of implants—although they were all silicone—at different times and were suffering from different ailments and diseases.  With the ruling, only the women who  originally filed a claim against Dow will  be allowed to participate in the class action  Rape law victory in  Mexico  Women in Mexico have reason to celebrate in their fight against male violence  against women. After heated debate, the  lower house of Congress approved an  amendment setting prison sentences from  eight to 14 years for husbands who rape  their wives.  Women who campaigned for the  amendment held a banner in the parliamentary chamber that read: "Rape in marriage is not the incorrect exercising of a  right. It is an attack on the individual guarantees of Mexican women."  Members of the ultra-conservative  National Action Party (PAN) voiced the  most mysoginist opposition. PAN's deputy,  Jorge Humberto Zamarripa, commented:  "What happens if a man ends up with a  prostitute because he doesn't want to rape  his wife, and catches a disease?"  Independent ecologist and deputy for  the ruling government, Carolina O'Farrill,  spoke out in support of the amendment:  "There is not a single party which is in favour of violence in the family. The initiative is a conquest that women have sought  for many years."  The measure still has to make its way  through the Senate.  Blow to affirmative action in the US  In response to a decision by the US  Supreme Court not to review Proposition  209, California's year-old ban on affirmative action programs for jobs, education  and contracts [see Kinesis November 1996,]  26 states have said they too will outlaw "racial quotas."  Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union said that all 26 states are now  planning to end or reduce their support for  affirmative action programs. A number of  states are already prepared to bring in anti-  affirmative action initiatives—Texas, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Washington, Arizona,  Georgia, Missouri and Michigan.  Martha Davis of the National Organization for Women states: "It would be disastrous if Proposition 209 were exported to  other states."  Affirmative action programs were  originally designed to help reduce the  number of Blacks and other marginalized  individuals—such as, women who were  excluded from schools, jobs and contracts.  Critics of affirmative action claim it has  turned into a system which allows unqualified people to entitlement corrupting the  country's "colour-blind Constitution."  By refusing the hear an appeal of  Proposition 209, the US Supreme Court signalled that voters are free to scrap the system. However, the legal battles are not entirely over as exisiting affirmative action  programs still have to be challenged, and  the ACLU and others promise to fight any  challenge all the way.  In January, the US government filed a  legal brief supporting affirmative action,  saying that Proposition 209 was a ruse to  lock in white male power at the expense of  Blacks, Hispanics and women.  BC introduces cell  phone initiative  A number of women in Vancouver at  high-risk for male violence will be given  cellular phones pre-programmed to dial  911 as part of a pilot project supported by  the provincial Attorney General. Under the  program, women using cell phones are to  be given priority over other calls to the  police.  The cell phones will be provided only  to women already enrolled in Vancouver's  Domestic Violence Emergency Response  System (DVERS) program, a community  partnership between ADT Security Systems, Battered Women Support Services  (BWSS) and the Vancouver Police Department. [The initial reporting of the program in  the mainstream media gave women the misleading impression that the cell phones are  available to any woman who requests one. The  provincial AG did nothing to correct this  wrong information.]  Under the DVERS program, women  who have left abusive domestic situations  and who are considered to be at high-risk  have alarm systems installed in their  homes, which automatically connect them  to police. However, the protection alarms  may offer only exists when the women are  at home.  Laraine Stuart of BWSS explains that  the DVERS program is directed at addressing a very small part of the male violence  against women problem: those women  who are threatened by ex-partners where  there is evidence of stalking and harassment. She adds that it should only be seen  as one of a number of strategies to combat  male violence.  As to the potential success of the cell  phone initiative, Stuart says they won't  know until the evaluation stage is completed. If the evaluation of the pilot project,  is positive the initiative will be extended to  parts of the province that have victim services and can support the technology.  Stuart notes that the program may not  work for rurfJ women as the response time  of police, due to distance, is lengthened. She  also holds that it is important that there is  an infrastructure in place to respond to  women's reports of violence. "The technology alone is not enough."  Bonnie Agnew of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter points out that the  program ignores the main problem, which  is the slow response and sloppy investigations of police to 911 calls made by woman  reporting male violence. What is needed,  she says, is a "swift, thorough and effective response from police."  Agnew says she is concerned that only  a handful of women will benefit from the  cell phone initiative, and that women using 911 from other phones will not get the  same treatment as those in the program la-  belledPriority One.  Women's groups have repeatedly  called for two things, saysAgnew: a re-deployment of police personnel from crimes  against property to violent crimes, in which  the vast majority of victims are women and  children; and second, that senior officials  in the police force put pressure on those  under their command to respond to 911  calls from women immediately and to conduct thorough investigations.  Agnew says that if these two initiatives  were carried out, women would be safer,  trust in police would be" raised, and men  would get the message loud and clear to  think twice before harming a women.  Woman claims police  officer raped her  Late one night in January 1997, Vancouver police responded to a domestic violence call from a women. Her husband was  taken away.  The woman says that one of the officers present told her he would have to come  back later to stay over as he lived in  Coquitlam.  The woman, a recent immigrant to  Canada who speaks little English, maintains she was afraid to say "no" to a police  officer~a figure of authority. However, she  was worried enough and called a friend  after the police left to tell her about it.  The woman says the police officer returned to her home in the morning and then  raped her.  After overcoming her initial fear of retaliation against her, she filed a sexual assault complaint. On July 30, the Crown decided, based only on the Vancouver Police  Department's internal investigation, that no  criminal charge should be laid against the  officer. The "alleged" rapist has since only  received a verbal reprimand from the VPD.  The woman was told she had 30 days  to file an appeal of the Crown's decision.  She says she didn't because she had lost all  confidence in the police.  Lilian To of SUCCESS, the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society, says the woman recently met with the  Attorney General's staff to present her evidence in the case. The Crown still stands  by its decision not to proceed.  Meanwhile, the woman has filed an  appeal to the Vancouver Police Board,  which deals with issues of ethical behaviour and protection of public trust.  SUCCESS' chair Mason Loh has expressed serious concerns about the police  officer's upholding of the professional code  of ethics and with the inability of the police system to take appropriate disciplinary  action other than providing "verbal reprimands."  The outcome of the appeal should be  forthcoming in January.  The woman is also talking to the Police Complaint Commission to see if the  provisions in the Police Act adequately deal  with the issue of ethical behaviour, and to  determine if new additions to the Act are  required.  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  The teachers'strike in Ontario:  Bill 160 not about education  by Sharon Bray  Wednesday, December 3 was a sad day in  Ontario. It was the day on which Bill 160, a  new Education Act for the province, became  law. On that day, the Conservative government  of Mike Harris took control of education out of  the hands of locally elected school boards, teachers and parents and placed it squarely into the  hands of an elected few in government.  Decisions concerning education will now  be made by cabinet—not even by the full legislature. School boards, teachers and parents do  not have to be included in any discussions. As  well, all new teachers will have to forfeit their  access to the Freedom of Information Act, which  means they will have no right to see their work  files unless they are willingly shown them by  their employer. These are just some of the problems with Bill 160.  Below, Sharon Bray provides her comments and analysis on Bill 160 and the two-  week long teachers strike in Ontario.  Bill 160 has very little to do with education, but much to do with taking money  from education in the short term and long  term. It will allow, almost immediately,  nearly $700 million to be removed from the  education system in Ontario. That's the  short term.  In the long term, the cuts will be even  worse. Bill 160 will allow non-qualified  people to be hired to teach at lower wages,  and it will eventually destroy the federations [unions] that protect teachers' working conditions—and hence, students' learning conditions—their professionalism, and,  of course, their salary levels. [In Ontario,  five federations represent the various constituencies of teachers: the Federation of Women  Teachers' Associations of Ontario, the Ontario  Public School Teachers' Federation, the Ontario  Secondary School Teachers' Federation, the  Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association, and l'Association des Enseignantes et des  Enseignants Franco-Ontariens. The Ontario  Teachers' Federation acts as the umbrella group  for all five teachers' unions.]  Bill 160 can, and probably will, put an  end to collective bargaining for teachers.  Schools will be run as businesses—schools  will have managers, not principals; students may get vouchers and be encouraged  to shop around for the school of their choice  (and those with money will undoubtedly  supplement their vouchers). This would  copy the American model, where the 'bottom line' is used to evaluate a school's success and determine the renewal or not of a  principal's or teacher's contract.  In return for allowing his government  to take control over the education system,  what has Mike Harris promised Ontarians?  A tax break, yet to be determined (although  those in higher income brackets will invariably be getting the better deal.)  Last month, when Ontario teachers  protested the Harris government by walking out of their classrooms for two weeks,  they did so not as a spontaneous reaction  to Bill 160. Their response was the culmination of protests against a right-wing government and its destruction of education  and other social programs—protests that  have been angry, strong and consistent  since they began.  Many teachers got their first big taste  of hitting the pavement, carrying placards,  chanting anti-government slogans, wearing  union buttons, and feeling the power that  surfaces when a cause unites us, in Hamilton, during the Days of Action in February  1996. More than 100,000 people marched  together—many of them teachers—to protest, among other things, the "Tool Kit" the  Harris government was threatening to impose on schools and teachers. (The kit was  intended to be a government package tell-  stopped traffic; we delivered information  pamphlets; we wrote letters and signed  petitions; we smiled and waved at motorists; we informed the public and many of  their support; and we welcomed steelwork-  ers, autoworkers, public sector workers and  parents onto our picket lines.  We were empowered despite an unresponsive government. We were united despite a media that endeavoured to divide  us. We were validated by a justice system  that would not issue a back-to-work-order.  There were the usual  garbage can fires to keep us warm;  there was trust and unity  among us; and...  there were plenty of doughnuts.  ing schools and teachers how to downsize  in a climate of a budget cuts to education.  It was never released, although many believe it to be a precurser to Bill 160.)  Similar demonstrations were held in  London, Peterborough, North Bay, Toronto  and Windsor, and each time, teachers were  there.  Teachers didn't only demonstrate in  the streets, but also in the schools. Work-  to-rule mandates were implemented  throughout the province, especially at the  secondary level. This meant absolutely no  services by teachers other than classroom  instruction; that is, no teacher involvement  in sports teams, student newspapers or  school bands, no marking or lesson plans  in the evening, all of which were not part  of teachers' contract and done on a volunteer basis.  No response came from the Harris government. Strike votes were taken. We knew  we'd be hitting the bricks in the next school  year.  What we didn't know at the secondary level was that the elementary school  teachers would be with us on the street.  Historically in Ontario, elementary teachers have not been militant. While they have  also seen their working conditions eroded,  they have spent their time surviving, not  fighting back.  When the Harris government tried to  play on this history as a tool to divide and  conquer the five teachers' unions, the elementary teachers said they would take no  gains on the backs of secondary school  teachers, and that if we walked out, they'd  be with us.  At 6:00am on Monday, October 27,  126,000 Ontario teachers did not go to  school. Instead, we walked a picket line for  10 hours; we rallied at Queen's Park [the  site of the provincial legislature] and at the  offices of members of the provincial parliament; we held candlelight vigils; we  We were uplifted by a Catholic Bishop who  said we may. be illegal but certainly not  immoral. We were praised by Labour leaders for our incredible organization. We were  thanked by a public who was too weary to  read Bill 160. We were joined by our principals and vice-principals (who will pay  unduly for giving that support). We were  conveniently ignored by our school boards  and trustees who had every the power and  the right to charge us and demand we return to work.  For two weeks on the picket line, not  all of us had a full sense of what we were  accomplishing. And surely not everyone  would agree that we have accomplished  anything at all. We started strong: 10 hours  on the line the first day, in rain storms and  in snow, then anywhere from three to six  hour shifts for the days that followed. There  were the usual garbage can fires to keep us  warm; there was trust and unity among  us...and there were plenty of donuts.  Picketing was most intense early in the  morning when members of other unions—  caretaking and secretarial staff—showed  up at school. Ours was an information  picket. We were not to physically prevent  anyone from crossing, but we were permitted to present an argument that might encourage others to honour our picket.  It's not easy to face a secretary, a friend  you've worked with for ten years, a woman  who makes half your salary, and ask her to  stay home from work, to forfeit her pay, to  ignore her employer. But this is exactly  what happened around the province. Some  secretaries stayed home; others did not.  Some went so far as to walk the picket line.  Others reported to different schools where  they were unknown.  No matter who crossed the line (and  crossers were few), no matter what the antiunion media of Ontario reported, and no  matter how arrogant the government became, teachers were together on that line.  One young teacher said she'd be walking  the pavement if it meant not losing her  house. Some of the more radical teachers  (and I'd never deny that most teachers are  small 'c' conservatives) used the 10 days to  address every picketer they met as "sister"  or "brother." While that's not the language  most of us use, no one complained because  that's what we were, and for some, what  we still are.  One teacher made her own sign: "Let  King Mike collect your taxes" (under Bill  160 he can, even without approval by the  legislature). A supportive motorist, and  there were many, painted on her car, "The  only good Tory is a suppository."  Not every person who drove by was  on our side though. We got the finger a few  times, mostly from 'grandpa-looking' guys  who usually accompanied their hand gestures with directives for us to return to  work, directives that were loaded with adjectives that they wouldn't use (I hope) in  front of their grandchildren.  One woman in York Region picketed  at a school in a remote area where only a  dozen teachers are employed. For nine  days, she was cursed at by the same man,  who drove by in a truck. When he saw her,  he slowed down, opened the window and  yelled, "Shove it up your fucking knickers."  The woman simply took this in stride.  She said nothing. She never complained.  But on the 10th day, which she knew would  be her final day on the line, she was ready  for him. When he stopped and yelled out  his usual invective, she waited for him to  finish and then responded with dignity,  "I'm not wearing any knickers." Later, she  admitted that it was her first time talking  back like that.  At the close of two weeks, the strike  ended, but badly. The leaders of the five  federations did not, but should have, made  their announcement together. The rank and  file was confused. No one was ready to give  up. (It is rumoured that the split came from  Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation's overly-close relationship with the  Ontario Federation of Labour and the Canadian Autoworkers, which are considered  more militant unions. Rumours of a general strike across the province also hovered  over the whole situation.)  On the morning after the leader of the  Ontario Public School Teachers' Federation  announced that its membership would be  returning to the classroom, many elementary school teachers were angry. They considered organizing their own protest to stay  out longer, but finally gave in and did as  their union advised. Ironically, the Harris  government has blamed "big union bosses"  for leading its membership into an illegal  strike; for many of us though, the reality is  that the union led us back in.  Teachers been back to work for several  weeks now. What has changed? A few  things. At first there was an eerie quiet.  Many students could not say the word  "strike." Many were eager to work—it  seemed they'd gained an understanding of  the privilege of education. There's been a  mad rush of mid-term exams and report  See TEACHERS page 15  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  2nd International Women's Conference Against APEC:  Momentum  carries on  by Janet llin Mou  On November 17 and 18, about 400  women gathered in Vancouver for the 2nd  International Women's Conference Against  APEC. Throughout the two days, during  which participants explored issues and developed plans of action, women from  around the world agreed that APEC (Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation) must be  stopped.  After opening prayers by Fay Edgar of  the Coast Salish Nation, Joan Grant-  Cummings, president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women,  gave a brief address in which she talked  about the "anti-woman global apartheid"  that is endemic not simply to APEC, but  also to the larger agenda of neo-liberalism  of which APEC and the MAI (the Multilateral Agreement on Investments) are a part.  Following Grant-Cummings was a  videotaped message of solidarity from Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu  Kyi.  The keynote speech was delivered by  Jeanette Armstrong, a writer and indigenous rights activist from the Okanagan  Nation. Enthusiasm for her words was established early when participants responded with enthusiastic cries to her comment that we are not living in a democracy  when multinationals based in the US and  Japan have more of a right to determine our  rights than we do.  Both days featured a plenary in which  women from the South and North spoke  on four issue areas: labour, human rights,  environment, and economic and social development. On Day One, the speakers included Alicia Sepulveda of the Telecommunication Workers Union in Mexico, Yayori  Matsui of the Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center, Sarojeni Rengam of the Pesticide Action Network in Malaysia, and  Sunera Thobani of the Women's Studies Department at Simon Fraser University.  Day Two featured presentations by  Cheung Lai-Ha of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, Bella Galhos, an  East Timorese women living in exile in  Canada, Kushi Kabir, an environmental activist from Bangladesh, and Tania Suarez  of the Zapatista National Liberation Front.  Women also got to attend a range of  workshops, including: the rise of the Right/  the disappeared, heterosexism /homophobia, Indigenous issues, poverty, health,  mega-development projects/aquaculture,  violence against women and globalization,  consumer campaigns, social clauses, advocacy for children, and the redirection and  regulation of capital.  In the last afternoon of the Conference,  participants reported back recommendations and resolutions from each workshop  area. Among them were calls from the Indigenous rights workshop that Indigenous  rights be recognized as human rights; that  corporations and governments be held accountable for the health and social problems of and violence against Indigenous  people; that an Indigenous Bill of Rights  which includes self-determination be created; and that the use of Indigenous women's bodies for scientific experiments comes  to an end.  Participants in the workshop on organized labour talked about increasing  outreach to youth, and the developing  greater ties with non-traditional sectors, especially migrant and low-income workers.  The workshop addressing advocacy  for children made recommendations related to government funding for children's  centres, the development of alternative  models for survival other than prostitution,  and the prosecution of sex traffickers in  their home countries.  Food and agriculture was also a major  issue discussed over the course of the Women's Conference. Among the recommendations were the need to identify food security as a human right so it cannot be included in trade agreements; and a call for  a moratorium on genetically engineered  food products. Out of the workshop, new  slogans were developed and shared, including: "Feed families first; trade the leftovers" and "Stop treating our soil like dirt."  From the Redirecting Capital workshop came the suggestion for increased  development of alternative economic models such as bartering, co-ops and credit  unions. The women presenting the recommendations received lots of support when  they said that nothing short of a feminist  revolution will bring about the full redirection and regulation of capital women demand.  Central to much of the anti-APEC organizing in Vancouver was a focus on the  human rights debate. While many women  attending the Women's Conference condemned leaders such as China's premier  Jiang Zemin and Indonesian president General Suharto, Sunera Thobani, in her speech,  challenged participants to also condemn  Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien and  US president Bill Clinton for their country's  own human rights violations.  Thobani pointed out that the way the  debate was being framed—solely targeting  particular Asian countries—has been very  racist. "Human rights violations are not  happening just in Asia, but also in Canada,  the US, Australia, and New Zealand."  Thobani said.  Although this elicited much cheering  and support, there was little ensuing action  proposed to ensure that human rights and  anti-racism activism go hand-in-hand.  Also central to a lot of debates at the  Conference was the role of social clauses.  Some women argued that social clauses are  an effective tool to hold multinationals accountable to women, while others argued  that they are a betrayal of women, particularly those in the South.  While many women debated these issues, other women formed a disability caucus to bring attention to the inaccessibility  INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S SOLIDARITY DINNER  One of the highlights of the Women's Conference was an international  dinner hosted by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women on  closing day (November 18). About 50 international guests attended the  Women's Conference, many of them sponsored by the People's Summit or  by InterPares, a Canadian-based international NGO.  After a fabulous dinner, women at each of the eight tables took turns singing solidarity and liberation songs in various languages, teaching each  other lyrics and tunes, and sharing stories of different liberation struggles.  One song, written in celebration of Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi,and brought  to us by Debbie Stothard of ALTSEAN (Alternative ASEAN Network on  Burma), went: "Freedom from fear; Freedom from fear; can't have revolution  without women's liberation; and a vision...a vision that's clear."  - Fatima Jaffer -  Iter national "V  lainst APj£C  PASSING ON THE TORCH TO MALAYSIA  The 2nd International Women's Conference Against APEC closed with  performances and messages by the youth caucus.To laughter, tears and  standing ovations, a series of younger women reassured the "old" women  that it was okay to "pass us the torch, because we have the fire!"  Women at the conference then formed a circle and passed around the  banner of the 2nd International Women's Conference from woman to woman.  Sarojeni Rengam and Irene Fernandez from Malaysia ended up with the  banner.  The Malayasian women were in the spotlight because the next APEC Summit will be held in Malaysia. Organizers of the 2nd Women's Conference  repeatedly expressed hopes that Malaysian women will take on the work of  hosting the 3rd International Women's Conference Against APEC. Some  women also expressed hopes that next year's conference will continue to  push a strong anti-APEC agenda, as set by the 1st Women's Conference  held in the Philippines in November 1996.  - Fatima Jaffer -  of the sites and lack of sensitivity-training  among the volunteers. These women issued  a challenge that women become proactive  in anticipating the potential needs of  women with disabilities by providing ASL  (American Sign Language) translation, asking participants not to wear perfume, having a quiet space, and ensuring the venues  are wheelchair and scooter accessible.  Overall, the action planning was quite  successful, and many women said they  were inspired to continue the struggle  against APEC, the MAI, and the larger  agenda of corporate globalization. Women  acted to maintain their momentum by establishing an international solidarity network, which was initiated by the participants of the workshop on research.

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  The impact of APEC on indigenous peoples:  New world order offers  nothing new  by Jeanette Armstrong   Jeanette Armstrong is from the Okanagan  Nation, residing in Penticton, British Columbia. She is a well-regarded visual, musical and  literary artist and is the Director of the  En'owkin Centre.  Armstrong is a strong advocate of indigenous rights, and was recently appointed to the  Council of Listeners in the International Testimonials on Violations to Indigenous Sovereignty. She was also invited to attend the recent peace talks in Mexico as an international  advisor by the Continental Coordinating Commission of Indigenous Peoples. Armstrong says  she is an advocate of a healthy environment  and social change in which peace between all  people is central.  Armstrong was the keynote speaker at the  2nd International Women's Conference  Against APEC recently held in Vancouver.  Below is a transcription of her speech.  I want to talk about the new world order and some of my thinking on it as an  indigenous person. I have had the opportunity to travel to and work in areas that  are critical in relation to indigenous people and their lives and rights. I've been able  to witness some of the suffering that takes  place as the shifting world order encompasses lands and peoples. This new world  order creates conditions where those who  are at the bottom of the rung in terms of  the economy are usually the indigenous  peoples.  I'd like to talk about globalization and  its effects on indigenous people, specifically  indigenous women, and on all women. I  want to begin by talking about the apparatus [used] to globalize the economy. Inherent to this apparatus are some economic  "truths" which allow the power-wielding  and wealthy countries to thrust their development models onto poverty stricken  countries. [These models are particularly  being imposed] on areas where there are  indigenous peoples caretaking the land and  the people, and where sustainable local  economies have been operating and developing for centuries.  [This "development"] is always carried  out in the form of investments and in the  form of aid and loans. These mechanisms  are used to extract resources cheaply and  to take advantage of lower costs, without  any regard for labour and human rights or  environmental protection. In most cases,  this is done to provide lower cost goods for  competitive trade in countries referred to  as "developed."  It's not coincidental that indigenous  peoples', women, labourers, minorities are  found in the lowest income sectors of all  such colonized countries. It's no coincidence that they're found living in the poorest conditions and suffering the lowest life  expectancies.  In such liberalization of "developing"  countries, these destitute [people] are usually used as the fodder to fuel the corporate labour machine, allowing it to grow,  extract, produce and manufacture goods  from the resources of lands that are seized  and held through military aggression  against those same peoples. Systemic violence, which results in genocide, is made  possible through such policies and is condoned by the political realm of pseudo-democracy I use the word, pseudo-democracy, because I don't believe there are true  democracies in situations where voters and  the consumers demand cheaper and  cheaper products.  It's not coincidental  that the human, political  and social rights of colonized people are totally ignored in large world trade  agreements, such as APEC,  and at nation state political  forums by the powers  heading the global economic reorganization.  In developed countries, there is a growing  awareness that the living  standards and the privileges of the middle class are  being eroded. Beyond that,  there are deeper implications for everyone in terms  of the new forms of oppression towards endangered  indigenous peoples and  endangered species of the  world emerging through  the increased globalization  of economies.  There are a number of  issues I want to refer to that  arise out of the demand by  globalization of increased  privatization and  commodification of all goods and services.  Particularly, in the areas of science and  health, service has becomes provisional to  the profit motive.  Indigenous peoples and local communities are saying, no, we're not going to allow this kind of privatization of our lands.  Chiapas [in Mexico] is a good example of  that. Where there are commonly held lands  or reservations or treaties that have been  enacted, we're seeing that those treaties,  agreements, whatever they might be called,  are right now the greatest threat to the  multinational corporations. So, of course,  there's an increased determination by those  domestic governments that are playing  handmaiden to the multinational corporations to make those lands and resources  accessible.  Where indigenous peoples oppose [the  increased control ;of their land and resources by corporations,] domestic governments are responding with force or coercion to secure access for multinational corporations. Increased militarization and increased violence in terms of human rights  violations committed against indigenous  peoples are a reality. We're looking at genocide in cases where indigenous peoples are  refusing to make way for and to give access to the privatization of lands.  In terms of our own economies, our  own countries, we can see the disparity that  is emerging between the various sectors. In  terms of North America—and I'm talking  about both Canada and the US and Mexico  to some degree—we're seeing a wider gap  between those that have and those that  haven't. And we're at a time when homelessness, poverty and disease are being  commodi-fied and services privatized.  Take, for example, education: education is  being privatized,  and it is not  [in the best  interests of]  human  need or human caring.  In  Canada, we  are seeing  the services  we have  taken for  granted for  the last 15-  20 years  dissolving  right out  from under  us. Our domestic gov-  ernments  are creating  policies  which  would put  our [pub-  licly-sup-  ported]  services in  the hands of [the for-profit] sector. Our domestic governments are creating policies  which will make it more feasible [for public services to be put out into the competitive market,] which only furthers the  commodification of those services.  We see the effect of this on indigenous  communities; we see the effect of this on  minorities; we see the effect of this on people who are living close to the poverty line  or in poverty. We see the immense suffering that's taking place in most countries.  I visited several countries this year,  which are newly liberalized in terms of  trade. ... I felt extreme fear for what may  happen there in the future, and extreme  grief for what I have seen taking place over  the past 10 years, going back to those countries. Some of the fear is from seeing a continuance of dispassion, dehumanization  and lack of caring by governments. One of  the things we need to think about is the inability of governments to extricate themselves from this kind of globalization; the  inability of governments themselves to find  ways in which local economies, national  economies can be supported adequately.  I can see a number of ways it can be  avoided, but increasingly governments are  at the mercy of these large agreements that  are not made democratically, that are not  supported democratically, and that are not  thought of democratically. I am very much  concerned that we are not living in a democracy; we are not practising democracy—that is a myth.  It's a myth when you know that multinational corporations situated in the US  or Japan or somewhere else have more of a  right to decide what happens to your world  and your environment and your life and  your security than you do. When we're in  a state where that situation exists, then  we're not living in a democracy.  I look around us at some of the real  issues... I know that every one of us sitting  here has someone in our family who has  cancer, who has a disease that's been created from this kind of technological world,  from the misuse of privatization and  commodification and from consumerism.  What I'm concerned about is our human  rights in a real sense—our everyday right  to have good food and clean water and to  live healthy for seventy-some years. But  this is not the case anymore. No one can  guarantee us any of those things under this  new world order.  The thinking behind this global economic system is that cheaper you can produce something, the more competitive it's  going to be, and that's supposed to be good.  But in doing so, you are also ensuring the  cheapest possible goods, the poorest quality services and the poorest quality foods.   k  That's what is being supported in this be- ^  cause that's what "competitiveness" ere- *■  ates. i  There's something wrong with that «  thinking. There's something wrong with -  world leaders who think that [corporate c  globalization] is for the human good. It's j  not about humans; it's not about health; it's £  not about life. It's against life; it's against  health.  I think we're in a crisis in terms of finding alliances and finding appropriate ways  to deal with this new world order. I really  believe that it must be people—and it's going to be the women of the world—who  will make the changes that need to happen.  I really rely on this kind of dialogue; I  really rely on this kind of alliance-making.  It needs to happen at this level. I implore  everyone to work hard and think about this  because I don't know if there's any going  back.  Sometimes I lose hope for the future; I  lose my optimism that there will be a future that's worth going to for my children  and my grandchildren. I hate to think about  what my grandson, who was just born three  months ago, is going to have when he  grows up; what my granddaughter is going to have when she grows up, she's two  years old. When she's my age, when she's  fifty, what is it going to be like? What are  we going to be facing? Some of my thoughts  are extreme when I see the things that are  happening in many countries as a result of  this kind of large agreement.  I just want to leave it at that and thank  everyone for listening to me and for the  work you're going to be doing, and tell you  that I love you and would like to support  you in every way possible if I can.  10  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  taVcWQ        c  on  Aeadina ufi to <ud tkiouyAout t&e ovee& t&e/tPS& Summit emu ittl/cuic&uv&i (Ttovettdw 19-25), a,  namSen o£ fcmtett action*, wene held t&iouakout t£e city. 7&e maiH4tneatft media—totatfy, aatiotuiMu and  intennatfonaMu—aauc oatu minimal mention to t&e tnemendout, ofafiotition to /t*PS& and t&e confconate  Cflo&aUfztion aacnda t&at jutt continued to bald ufi.

The  People's  Summit  March  Anywhere from 6,000 to I0,000 people came out on a wet Sunday to protest the anti-people values imbedded in the APBC agenda. The protest was organized by  the People's Summit at the close of their conference. While many anti-APEC protestors in Vancouver had not seen eye-to-eye with the watered-down politics of the People's  Summit, many sectors of Vancouver's progressive community put differences aside to show up. The result was what some call one of the largest demonstrations  Vancouver's city streets have seen, outside of annual Peace marches.  There was discrepancy in estimations of the size of the crowd-the police said 12,000, possibly overestimating size to justify the massive RCMP force that met the  demonstration at various points. The media reported only about 4,000.  Whatever the size, the energy was incredible and the range of political issues, views and direction represented was unprecedented, according to some. The march  was led by the Aboriginal Women's Action Network, and other members of the Aboriginal community. Thousands of students, feminists and anti-poverty activists chanted  and sang. Many protestors carried "HO! to APBC" flags, the name of the coalition opposing the People's Summit's "reformist" anti-APEC stance. The International  Socialists brought along placards that condemned human rights violations in China and Indonesia. There was enormous international presence, from Tibetan monks to  women from Sri Lanka protesting human rights abuses to protestors condemning the abuses of Burma's military government.  The long trek through downtown streets spanned several blocks at a time. We were encouraged throughout by car honks and cheers from passers-by, as well as the  occasional blank looks and sometimes irritation.  The march wrapped up at the RCMP road block cutting off the Canada Trade and Convention Centre from public access. Several speakers addressed the enormous  crowd, jammed under the Cordova Street tunnel, including Nitanis Desjarlais of the Native Youth Movement frfo/a afore r/fAf.J  photos by Fatima Jaffer  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 ^fie  oflatitmal  Q{J?o>  ¬∞ti  (^Protest  &fyainst  &%¬£>&*&:  The National Women's Day of Protest Against APEC was an incredible  show of the strength and creativity of the women's movement. Every Thursday for almost two months before the APEC Summit, the Feminist Networking Group met at the Vancouver Status of Women to strategize and organize  for the big day. (The FNG is a coalition of women's groups in the Lower  Mainland of BC that meets regularly to network, discuss issues and plan  actions.)  The FNG took action when it became clearer that very little was being  done to mobilize women in Canada against APEC. The FNG wanted to ensure that the adverse affect on women of trade liberalization agreements,  such as APEC, were brought to the forefront.  As the main campaign action, the FNG called on women to wear red  armbands on November 24 in solidarity with women across the country and  around the globe who oppose the global corporate agenda. Red armbands  were chosen as a symbol of resistance and of women's blood that will be  shed as a result of APEC-influenced policies in countries of the Asia-Pacific.  To accompany the red armbands, the FNG produced brochures which  spelled out the agenda behind APEC and made clear how it relates to what is  happening in the lives of women in Canada today. The brochure also gave  examples of how women could get involved in the campaign wherever they  might be.  The campaign took off as more and more women got interested in the  analysis and actions of the FNG. By the time November 24 rolled around,  more than 10,000 brochures, 8,000 red armbands, and 500 copies of VSW's  56-page anti-corporate globalization document had been distributed through  VSW alone.  One of the best ideas coming out the FNG was producing stickers that  read: "Women Oppose APEC; wear a red armband on Nov 24." Over a three-  week period, 15,000 of them were distributed around Vancouver. In fact, the  stickers were so wildly popular that a third run (of 500) had to be ordered  just a day after the second run had come back from the printers.  The stickers were a great way of getting a whole range of women involved in the campaign. Women who normally wouldn't "think of doing  anything political" took a stack of stickers, and eagerly came back for more.  And "regular" activists around town spent hours and hours plastering their  neighbourhoods and the downtown core with stickers.  Women spotted wearing stickers were often approached on the street by  others wanting one for themselves. And if they didn't have any more, the  women would just tear the sticker off their jacket or bag and hand it over.  The ripple effect of the National Women's Day of Protest Against APEC  campaign will continue for a long time. Stickers are still up on various light  poles, bus shelters and newspaper boxes. And women are still asking for the  FNG's and VSW's materials on APEC and other forms of corporate globalization.  They're also asking: "What s next?" Our challenge to the MAI. Stay tuned.

More than 30 women  showed up at 7:00am at 16 stations to hand out red armbands and information sheets on why APEC is dangerous to women in Canada.  Most women were happy to take the red armbands and information.  Some women asked for more to give to friends and co-workers, and some  women were even already wearing their red armbands. In all, more than  3,200 red armbands were handed out during this one action alone.  The launch  At 8:00am, the Lower Mainland Feminist Networking Group held a press  conference outside City Hall to launch the National Women's Day of Protest  Against APEC. Media spokespeople included Yayori Matsui of the Asia-Japan Resource Centre in Tokyo, Irene Fernandez of Tenaganita, a migrant  workers' group in Malaysia, and Fay Blaney and Rain Daniels of the Aboriginal Women's Action Network in Vancouver.  The FNG's Ellen Woodsworth also spoke about why the coaltion would  be the presenting bread and roses at different stages of their life throughout  the day~from flour and seeds, to dough and rosebuds, to "Bread and Roses."  She said that the FNG wanted to show symbolically that the women's  movement worldwide is not just reacting to the impact of the global corporate agenda on our lives, it is also working to build alternatives to the current  system of economic restructuring that benefit broader populations, and not  just wealthy people.  Demo at the VSE  By noontime, about 20 women gathered in front of the Vancouver Stock  Exchange downtown, the seat of investors whose interests seem to be central  in the APEC's agenda. The FNG handed out red armbands and brochures to  women walking by and to those coming out of the VSE. Not surprisingly,  there were very few women who exited (or entered) the doors of the Stock  Exchange.  Joan Grant-Cummings, president of the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women, Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians, and members of the FNG all challenged about the profit-making (at any cost) motive  that lies behind the APEC agenda.  "82,000 corporations paid no taxes in '97," was the chant that rang out at  the demonstration, referring to the number of corporations operating in  Canada which got out of paying any tax on their profits. (Between 1980 to  1996, Canadian corporations made more than $167 billion in profits without  paying a cent in income taxes, according to the BC Federation of Labour.)  As well, women called out the names of corporations, and the amount of  deferred taxes they owed to the federal coffers. Then, Ellen Woodsworth pulled  out some bread dough and explained the vision behind "Bread and Roses,"  as other women chanted, "Share the dough, don't horde the dough" and  handed out pieces of the bread dough to women and media present. (Just a  small amount of dough can be used as a starter to bake a loaf of bread.)  Taking back the VAG  At 4:00pm, women gathered on the Georgia Street side of the Vancouver  Art Gallery to continue the public protest. The VAG is a traditional public  protest area, but during the APEC Summit became the site for a giant globe,  bearing the official APEC insignia and philosophy. (The other public protest  area downtown-the Vancouver Public Library-had also been taken over by  pro-APEC forces, namely General Motors.)  At the beginning, the action was dampened by the appearance of members of the Indonesian secret security force (Intel). They harassed and threatened the East Timorese activists who had been invited to perform their songs  of liberation.  The energy among the women present picked up as a group led a tour  around the VAG, chanting and handing out red armbands and brochures  along the way. After several rounds, women returned to the APEC-propa-  ganda structure, where the FNG invited them to write their thoughts on a  banner simply titled: "Our Vision."  More and more women gathered as the evening progressed, anxious to  begin weaving the Ribbon of Hope II...  - Fatima Jaffer and Agnes Huang -  Later in the evening of the National Women's Day of Protest Against APEC, several  Vancouver women's organizations came together to hold a Ribbon of Hope Against APEC  around the Vancouver Art Gallery.  The idea of the Ribbon-a stringing together of banners, cloth and t-shirts held up by  hundreds of women-originates in the Ribbon of Hope that was taken to the 4th World  Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995. The project, initiated by rural Cambodian  women, inspired women around the world to contribute to what became a 10-mile long  "ribbon" intended to link the governmental world conference in Beijing with the nongovernmental women's forum in Huairou.  Vancouver's Ribbon of Hope II did not stretch as long, but certainly made a statement along Hornby Street, where a long line of stretch limousines awaited APEC guests  at the Hotel Vancouver on their way to the cultural dinner hosted by Canadian Prime  Minister Jean Chretien at BC Place.  The ribbon of banners and women, about 250-strong, ended the protest with a march  down to BC Place, chanting "People's needs, not corporate greed" and "Women United,  Never Get Invited," as many women told curious passers-by why we wouldn't want to  be invited anyway.  Ellen Woodsward of the Lower Mainland Feminist Networking Group and Fay Blaney  of the Aboriginal Women's Action Network addressed the crowd as about 50 RCMP officers gathered to protect the heads of state from the random protestor who might choose  to scale the 12-foot steel fence, brave the dobermans, and dash the 300-plus metres past  countless security guards, into BC Place where the dinner was being held.  - Fatima Jaffer -  Women in Nelson mobilize  Within a week of hearing about the National Women's Day of Protest Against APEC,  women from Nelson, BC had planned a protest march, put stickers up around town, and  organized a follow-up discussion event. They had also written (and gotten published) a  letter to the editor in the local newspaper on why people in their community should be  concerned about APEC.  Several women from Nelson came down to Vancouver for the 2nd International  Women's Conference Against APEC. There, they met and talked with members of the  FNG who were busily flogging their "Women Oppose APEC" materials.  Back in Nelson, more than 50 women and children marched through the downtown  business core of town on November 24. Street theatre, chanting, singing...all highlighted  the action. Women small business owners came out of their shops to ask how APEC  affected them.  Hannah Hadiken, the regional co-representative for NAC in BC, says, "Overall, the  response was positive. During the march, a number of women even came up to us and  requested red armbands, saying, 'Of course, I will support'."  - Kelly Haydon and Agnes Huang - Features  NO! to APEC: Continuing the resistance  ft was a fitting finale to all the anti-APEC actions in Vancouver. On November 25, the last day of the APEC Summit in Vancouver, more than 3,000 anti-  APEC activists came together for the NO! to APEC march and rally.  Throughout the past year, NO! to APEC (the Network Opposed to Anti-People Economic Control) has taken the lead in organizing and mobilizing the  opposition to APEC in Canada. Vancouver's NO! to APEC coalition is made up of some 30 women's, students' and people's groups.  The march and rally started at Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Demonstration assembled were joined by a boisterous contingent  of women, called together by the Vancouver Status of Women. The women marched behind bright and colourful banners declaring: "lesbians Resist APEC"  and "Women Unite Globally."  The march moved down Hastings Street towards the downtown core of the city. Along the way, it stopped at various sites to hear the words of various  activists, including the Raging Crannies and Christine Wood from the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre.  It was a raucous affair-the chanting kept growing louder and louder and new chants were made up. There was a marching band, a devil on stilts, and  a huge structure symbolizing corporate greed and exploitation created members of Art Against APEC.  The march wound up at the Robson Street-side of the Vancouver Art Gallery, where protesters were cordoned off by police to prevent them from  encroaching too close to the Hotel Vancouver, where a number of APEC delegates were staying.  At the rally, community activists and international guests spoke about their opposition and resistance to the  APEC agenda. Among them were Ring Alcuitas-Imperial from the Philippine Women Centre, one of the key organizing 'iSjt  groups of the NO! to APEC coalition, and Nadine Chambers of the Vancouver Lesbian Connection.  The march and rally was also the closing event to NO! to APEC's People's Conference Against Imperialist   jg |  Globalization. Bringing together more than TOO women and men, the four-day conference was a furthering of the mm  work started the year before at the People's Conference in Manila. • Agnes Huang •  ||N0! to APEC organizers  ' Monica Urrutia and Janis  Kaleto emcee the march am  rally.  As the world turns: the media centre at the APBC Summit  Kinesis' Fatima Jaffer plays mini  golf at the official 1997 APEC Summit in Vancouver. Yes...Kinesis was  spunky enough to apply for media  accreditation to the official APEC Summit, if only to take advantage of the  opportunity to access a site under  heavy guard and pepper the media  centre with women's anti-APEC materials.  Agnes Huang and Fatima Jaffer  applied for media accreditation late  one night in between anti-APEC demonstrations, a mere two days before  heads of state from the APEC-mem-  ber countries were set to descend on  Vancouver. Twenty-four hours later,  our by lined articles checked and copies of Kinesis-replete with anti-APEC  coverage-perused, we were treated  to a lengthy wait while an RCMP officer called Ottawa for security  checks.  A painful hour later, we were told  we had (miraculously) passed the  security check. A half-an-hour later,  we had our official APEC Summit media accreditation passes. We were  handed our official bright red APEC  umbrellas and "Suniife Insurance"  media bags, with tons of reading  material on how great APEC is and  how rainy Vancouver can get.  And so late on Sunday night, we  began our lengthy journey to the  media centre, which was housed at  APEC's downtown headquarters-the  Canada Trade and Convention Centre.  After a long walk through  streets, alleys, underground  maltways and past several  security checks, where RCMP  officers scrutinized our media badges with flashlights  and electronic gadgets, we  reached the final security  point-a magnificent marquee tent with airport-like  security, only more thorough.  We had to empty every metal  object from our pockets and  bodies, including our metal-  framed spectacles, while our  Suniife bags (containing tons  of Women Oppose APEC press  materials) were hand-  checked. Both of us were asked why  we had red armbands on (a symbol  of women's opposition to APEC) and  whether we had "covered" the massive anti-APEC demonstration earlier  that day. Both officers tried to di  minish the size of the demo with  comments like, "There were only  about 700 people, not 12,000, as  the media says!"  In the media centre, row upon  row of trestle tables housed members of the media from across  Asia....or, at least male journalists.  Women made up less than ten percent of those present. The larger OS  news networks, the Canadian media  and the Japanese media crews-all  male-dominated-were housed in  separate tent-like structures. Television screens everywhere pumped images and newsfeed of major APEC  activities, including speeches at the  City of Vancouver's $1,000-a-plate  dinner.  A cafe made of aluminium pipes  and stairways towered above us,  doling out free coffee and pastries. A beer garden served free  "samples" of Pacific Brewing  Company's beer. We paused a  while in the mini-golf course,  which was surprisingly unpopular.  After surreptitiously dropping off dozens of media packages on the National Women's  Day Against APEC, we left the  media fortress, where the real  world felt like a million mites  away. Nobody checked our  bags. Strangely,  the RCMP  seemed to fear more far the  safety of the APEC leaders and  bureaucrats, not the general populace of the APEC nations, who stand  to lose the most.  • Fatima Jaffer -  photo by Agnes Huang  14  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Commentary  Anti-APEC organizing in Vancouver:  Canada's own history denied  by N. Gitanjali Lena and  Brenna Bandar  The only thing wrong with APEC (the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) is that certain countries with atrocious human rights  records—namely, China and Indonesia—are  allowed to have a seat at the table. That seemed  to be the sentiment most often conveyed during a lot of the anti-APEC organizing in Vancouver.  Despite efforts by women's groups, people of colour and Aboriginal people to broaden  the understanding of why APEC is so dangerous, the mainstream media and much of the  public were all too happy to jump onto the human rights bandwagon.  Below, N. Gitanjali Lena and Brenna  Bandar provide some critical comments on the  racism that belies the narrow focusing on the  poor human rights records of a few countries  and the setting up of an "us-versus-lhem"  mentality. Lena is with the South Asian  Women Centre's Revival Group in Vancouver  and Bandar is a law student at the University  of British Columbia  "Close your eyes and let's play a game;  we'll describe a country and you guess the  name."  Here are some clues: attempted genocide of indigenous people, colonization and  continued theft of land (reflected in the British Columbia Treaty Commission process),  torture, murder (Dudley George killed by  RCMP at Stony Point, Ontario), relocation  (Innu people moved out of their traditional  homeland), environmental disasters (WAC  Bennett dam in Northern BC)...  Did you guess right? We are describing Canada, from its colonial past to its not-  so-post-colonial present.  Yet, during the challenge to the APEC  Summit in Vancouver, there was an almost  complete silencing of Canada's continued  colonization of indigenous land and people by many of the anti-APEC protestors.  Or were they anti-Asian protestors?  In mid-November, Vancouver was  ablaze with anti-APEC fervour. The only  problem was that the majority of protestors  themselves were unwilling to point that  critical gaze at themselves.  A number of conscious organizers involved in anti-APEC organizing at UBC  tried to ensure there were panels discussions,  teach-ins and other events where the colonial poverty-making occupation of our own  Vancouver was openly discussed. However,  despite the "protest within a protest" that  many women of colour waged against the  racist agenda of the Right and within the Left,  some protestors chanted on and on "APEC  that APEC represents an imperialist  agenda. APEC's agenda is Canada's  agenda, like it or not—a marriage of free  trade, violations of human rights, of the  human spirit, of our environment and all  the life it contains.  It is from the white-settler colonies  of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and  First Nations people point out the connection between the BC Treaty  Process and APEC at the People's Summit March.  go home," (sounding uneasily like, "Go back     the United States that the idea for Asia-  First Nations people point out the connection between the BC Treaty  Process and APEC at the People's Summit March.  na's premier Jiang Zemin and Indonesian  president General Suharto—and human  rights atrocities in "far away" places.  Meanwhile, some people of colour and  First Nations protestors reminded them  about the events of the past 500 years in  Canada. Biological warfare in the form of  settler-borne diseases such as smallpox and  measles eradicated whole communities of  indigenous peoples. This is just one of many  examples.  We should not ignore that leaders of certain Asian nations are responsible for great  atrocities, but neither should we ignore that  our own governments are complicit in these  atrocities and commit their own atrocities.  Canada is inextricably bound to APEC.  There is no "APEC-free zone," if we agree  "despots" were invited by our lily-white  but misguided leaders. The APEC Summit in Vancouver and the military/police  goon squad that guarded it were no mistake.  The fact that Canadian imperialists  play a large role in the violations of human rights domestically and internationally by profiting from trade policies that  exploit workers, indigenous communities  and people surviving poverty seems to  have gotten lost in the slogan-production  of the anti-APEC movement.  UBC student protestors shouldn't  have been shocked by the police action  they witnessed. The police have been  menacing indigenous peoples, people of  colour and poor people in Vancouver for  eons. Rather than become aware of the  prevalence of the ongoing state-sponsored  violence in Canada—which tarnished  UBC's hallowed gates for a short while—  student activists are launching a civil suit  against RCMP officers who violated their  "individual" rights under the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms.  Some people who were pepper-  sprayed and roughed up by the police garnered nationwide outrage, got front page  media coverage, got letters to the editor  printed in defense of them, and got support to file complaints about the violations  of their individual human rights. Whose  plight generated sympathy? Middle class  white student protestors, for the most part.  We find it necessary to consider the optics of the protest. The nearsighted focus  on individual rights and "democracy" does  not allow for a critique of how global capitalism is impacting on the lives of poor people of the South and the North. In addition,  the mainstream media plays into the hands  of those activists who are more interested  in becoming martyrs for their own status,  than in actually building a radical alternative social movement.  What happened as a result of the nar-  individual men. Why is it necessary to elevate individuals who openly admit they  orchestrated their own arrests? How does  this strengthen our resistance to globaliza-  opposition to APEC. Namely, in order to  be able to raise their specific concerns with  the APEC and the broader agenda of corporate globalization, they had to first clarify  that this did not mean they supported or  belittled the human right abuses by the  Chinese and Indonesian governments.  An example of that tension, which  heightened during the week Vancouver  seiged the Summit, was expressed on one  sign held by a woman at UBC that read,  "I'm Asian and I'm against human rights  violations."  TEACHERS from page 8  cards, and the school calendar has been  adjusted slightly to address some of the  time lost.  As time passes, Bill 160 is mentioned  less and less, but it is not forgotten. Teachers still wear their green ribbons. (Parents  in Ontario organized the green ribbon campaign to make a statement about the future  of education in this province.) Some school  boards have directed teachers not to wear  them. One teacher was suspended for wearing a "blatantly anti-government" t-shirt in  the classroom.  During the recent debate at Queen's  Park over Bill 160, no green ribbons were  permitted—they were too political according to the Tories. Still, every NDP and Liberal MPP wore one. After much hoopla, all  but two NDPers removed their ribbons. The  two NDPers were expelled from the house  for the day, in spite of arguments reminding  the government that white ribbons, red ribbons and poppies were also political statements that were allowed and even encouraged in the House.  But the government didn't listen to such  reasoning. However, Mike Harris couldn't  help but hear the woman who sat next to me  in the legislature gallery, a young teacher  from my school who found herself almost  rubbing elbows with the premier. She approached him directly and inquired, "What  private institution will you be sending your  children to once you've destroyed the education system in Ontario?" He became testy  and announced, "I'll be sending them to the  same school as usual," as he stomped off.  We all stomped out of the legislature  shortly after as a woman from the gallery,  who could abide no more, stood up and  called all Tories a bunch of "fascist pigs."  The speaker cleared the gallery. When I  saw that woman in the hall a moment  later, she said, "it was the most therapeutic thing I've done in my life."  So Bill 160 is now law. The general  sentiment among teachers is one of doom,  of overwhelming sadness. Some teachers  continue to picket, before and after  school, but we all know that if the Tory  plan comes true, education will suffer,  we'll all suffer, in spite of having an alleged few bucks of tax breaks in our pockets.  Our only hope is at the ballot box.  Both NDP and Liberal leaders have promised, if they are elected, to repeal 160, or  at least the most undemocratic elements  of it. And so, despite our sadness, we are  solid. Teachers, and all unionized work  ers, parents, students, and other community-minded residents in Ontario should,  and I hope, will continue working actively,  with energy and money, to erase the Tories  and the damage they've done.

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  Women's human rights and APEC:  Reframing the debate  by Yayori Matsui  Yayori Matsui was featured as a plenary  speaker at the 2nd International Women's Conference Against APEC in Vancouver last November. In her talk, presented below, she addressed the framing of the human rights issues  by Asian and Western leaders, and how women  are reframing the debate.  Matsui is a founding member and the current director of the Asia-Japan Women's Resource Centre in Tokyo. She is a renowned journalist who wrote on issues of social welfare,  the environment, development and human  rights during many of her thirty-three years  at Asahi Shimbun, until her retirement in  1993. Matsui is the author of 12 books including Women's Asia, which examines the situation of women in different Asian countries.  As a woman from Japan, a country  which is part of the North as one of the  most industrialized economic powers but  not in the West as an Asian country, I want  to share my experiences and views on  APEC and human rights. As you may  know, some Asian countries are now challenging the concept of human rights itself  as a product of the West and even demanding the revision of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the occasion of  its 50th anniversary next year. Such debate  on human rights inAsia has deep implications because it questions modern industrial civilization and its economic and technological development model.  Before elaborating on the human rights  debate in Asia, I want to describe to you  the reality of people, especially of women,  in Asia, which I have seen with my own  eyes.  Last August, I visited Thailand as a  member of a Women's Study Tour group  organized by our Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center, and last September I visited  Burma as a resource person for a human  rights training course. What I saw in these  two neighbouring countries gave us a clear  idea of the impact of the economic development promoted by APEC on women,  children, indigenous people and other  marginalized people.  Our group travelled to northern Thailand to see the background to the growing  sex trafficking of Thai women to Japan and  other countries. We were shocked to see the  sheer poverty in the rural villages, especially in hilltribe areas. This is in dramatic  contrast to the accumulation of wealth and  prosperity in the capital, Bangkok, where  there are traffic jams due to too many cars  and more than one thousand high rise  buildings.  The economic growth of Thailand on  a macro level had been remarkable with a  greater than 10 percent annual GNP growth  since the late 1980s. Until the sudden currency crisis which started last summer.  However, once you step in the rural areas  in the north and the northeast, you see a  totally different world where people suffer  from economic deprivation and environmental destruction—in other words, human rights violations.  Thailand is seen as a model economy  among APEC countries for following quite  liberal trade and investment policies. As a  matter of fact, we hardly saw any social  policies implemented [for the benefit of]  rural and hilltribe people. This type of economic development in Thailand has widened the gap between rich people and poor  people, and urban people and rural people. The economic gap between the capital  and Isaan in the northeastern region has  been reported as 10 to one, and between  Bangkok and the north, eight to one. Japan,  among other foreign countries, has been  deeply involved in such unjust economic  development in Thailand, as investors and  as an economic development aid donor  country.  As a result, poor farmers and hilltribe  people have to sell their young daughters  to the sex industry. These girls are getting  younger and younger because the fear of  AIDS has increased the demand for  younger "safer" girls—those not yet infected with HIV. However, it is reported  some 70 percent of these "clean" girls get  HIV within one year after they are put into  brothels. The total number of people infected with HIV has reached more that one  million in Thailand; in many villages we  visited, we saw girls dying from AIDS  every day.  More and more Thai women are sent  abroad by trafficking organizations I feel  ashamed to say Japan is the country receiving the largest number of trafficked women  from neighbouring Asian countries because  the expanding sex industry in Japan demands Thai girls. It is ironic to notice the  sex industry is the most deregulated industry, with no rules, much less a code of conduct. This allows the sex industry to use  anyone as commodities, especially women,  just as British merchants used African people in the 18th century. It can be said that  sex trafficking of women is one of the worst  cases of human rights violations in the 20th  century, in the sense that these women are  not treated as human beings but as commodities. Thai women are traded at a price  of four million yen in Japan.  At the same time, Burmese girls are  also trafficked into Thailand. According to  a Thai NGO working on children's rights,  some 40 to 50,000 Burmese girls have been  sent to Thailand, where they are even more  brutally abused than Thai girls. They are  at the bottom of the prostitution industry  and 80 to 90 percent of them become infected with HIV, due to their extremely low  status and lack of knowledge about self  protection in brothels.  When I visited Burma, I heard from a  researcher that many Burmese girls who get  AIDS, and therefore become "useless" to  brothel owners, are sent back to Thai-Burmese and Thai-Chinese border towns in  garbage trucks and just dumped there to  die. Even if they manage to reach their families, they are often left outside and fed like  dogs until they die, because of ignorance  and fear of AIDS.  rice to the government, and  even forced conversion to Buddhism (because  many anti-government ethnic minorities  are Christian.) Universities are closed for  many months. Workers are poorly paid  (only four US dollars a month). Burmese  people are deprived of almost all human  rights.  Despite this and worldwide opposition  and protest ASEAN (the Association of  South East Asian Nations) agreed to accept Burma as a member country. Now the  Burmese military regime is mounting a  propaganda campaign around its success  in joining ASEAN, claiming its policies are  approved by other Southeast Asian countries.  As a matter of fact, the Burmese military regime is now entering a new stage of  economic development with much foreign  investment from ASEAN countries. In Rangoon, you see foreign businessmen and  many new high rise buildings and luxury  hotels whose room charge is US $200 in contrast to a monthly wage of US $4 for female  factory workers and 10 cents a day for brick  carrying day labourers. This is the type of  developmentASEAN is supporting. In line  with the APEC policy of liberalization this  type of economic system intensifies the  structural violence and social injustice  against people.  Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir, a  leader of ASEAN who endorsed Burma's  membership, has been challenging Western  domination and advocating an "anti-Western" position. At the extended Asia-Pacific  Foreign Ministers' Conference in Kuala  Lumpur last July, he even demanded the  revision of the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights, and the Indonesian and  Chinese foreign ministers agreed to his proposal. He did not elaborate how the Declaration should be changed, but what  Mahatir and other Asian leaders are questioning is the universality and indivisibility of human rights.  Mahatir's views are in common with  those expressed by other Asian govern  ments at the World  / Human Rights  Conference in Vienna in 1993. Since  then, they have  been advocating  so-called "Asian  values" against  universal application of human  rights which they  consider products  of the West. They  refuse the West's  imposition on non-  western countries.  Their arguments on human  rights can be put  into the following  three main points:  Firstly, state  sovereignty should  be respected and  human rights issues should be  treated within a country as domestic issues.  The foreign or international community  should not interfere on human rights issues.  China has always emphasized this view  very strongly.  Secondly, cultural relativism is advocated especially by Islamic countries which  insist that the cultural traditions and customs of each country should be given priority and human rights should not be applied to deny such cultural practices.  Thirdly, under the "development first"  theory, economic development is vitally important for developing countries to overcome poverty, and so human rights and democracy are luxuries for hungry people.  This position criticizes the West as interested in only civil and political rights, and  emphasizes that economic, social and cultural rights should be more respected. Malaysia, Indonesia and Burma have been  advocating this view.  Let's look at these arguments from  Asian people's perspective. Regarding the  state sovereignty theory, we should totally  agree to it, in the sense that super powers  do use human rights for their nationalistic  interests. For example, the US imposes human rights principles on certain countries  which aren't friendly to it, but condones  gross human rights violations by dictatorial governments which it supports, like  some Latin American dictators and the  former brutal dictatorships in Korea and  Taiwan.  We cannot accept the double standard  of Western powers in the application of  human rights principles. However, I believe  human rights violations should not be allowed by any country anywhere. Human  rights should be protected across national  borders and any violation should be solved  by international actions. How can we stop  acting for the freedom of [Burmese pro-  democracy leader] Aung Sang Suu Kyi?  Regarding the argument on culture  and human rights, we should fully respect Feature  Violence Against Women in War and Armed Conflict Situations:  cultural diversity and make more efforts to  preserve it. We are concerned that local  cultures are being destroyed and a global  homogenized consumer culture is invading the world. It is the economic globalization by TNCs (transnational corporations)—in other words, the APEC development model—which has promoted such a  [monolithic] cultural phenomenon.  The human right to preserve one's own  culture should be respected. However, culture is not static and unchangeable. Some  cultural practices are harmful and oppressive to women. The problem is that, in most  countries, it is men who decide what culture should be preserved and what culture  should be abandoned. The point is that  dominant culture is male culture so women  should radically change such culture and  create new, more feminized cultures.  In Japan, when men claim that Japanese women don't respect traditional culture, we argue that women want to change  oppressive cultural traditions. The right-  wing is attacking the war compensation  issue claiming that Asian "comfort  women"—survivors of military sexual  slavery by Japanese army—volunteered to  be prostitutes and were not forcibly taken.  They also slander any feminist proposals  including changing of the family name system to allow women to retain their maiden  names.  I know many Muslim women all over  the world are campaigning against discriminatory cultural practices and advocating that violence against women should not  be allowed in the name of culture and tradition. At the International Conference on  Violence against Women in War and Armed  Conflict Situations recently held in Tokyo  from October 31 to November 3 [see  sidebar], an Algerian woman from an organization called "Women under Muslim  Law" reported on the frightening violence  against Afghani women by the extremist  Taliban group. Women are not allowed  even to go out on the street and if they do,  they are cruelly beaten.  The global women's movement vigorously campaigns against all forms of violence against women—in the family, in the  community and by the state—as violations  of human rights. As a result, the concept of  women's human rights was accepted at the  Vienna Conference by the international  community. The Declaration on the Elimination of all forms of Violence Against  Women was adopted in 1993 by the United  Nations General Assembly which obliges  signatory governments to take effective  measures for prevention of such violence.  The Platform for Action adopted at the  4th World Conference on Women held in  Beijing in 1995 also included strategies to  be taken by governments towards ending  violence against women. We should expand the understanding of violence against  women to include structural violence  caused by development projects, such as  ecological destruction, forced eviction,  mass scale overseas migration and so on.  They can be considered as economic social  rights.  The third point of the human rights  debate in Asia is related to development,  which is most relevant to APEC Women  aren't against development itself but we do  have to question "development for  whom?" I have been to Malaysia many  times because it is most closely.connected  with Japan economically. There are hundreds of Japanese multinational factories in  peninsular Malaysia where young women  workers are not allowed to organize labour  unions. In East Malaysia on Borneo Island,  which is covered by thick tropical rainforest, I was shocked to see so many precious  tropical trees being logged for export to Japan. Japan is the largest importer of tropical timber in the world. In the state of  Sarawak, where logging is at its height,  more than twenty indigenous tribal people  are suffering due to the loss of their livelihood. They resist by barricading logging  roads but then they are arrested and treated  cruelly.  It is Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir,  the staunchest anti-West advocate, who is  aggressively followingAPEC globalization  policy by inviting so many TNCs in, and  by exporting precious natural resource for  the globalized world market. Therefore,  while he is attacking the West and propagandizing Asian values, he is practising the  very western model of development [he despises].  His position reminds me of the principle of "Japanese Spirit and Western technology" advocated by Japanese leaders of  the Meiji modernization period [in the 20th  century]. Afraid that Japanese people might  be influenced by western democracy, they  promoted industrialization initiated by the  state and not by the people. It can be said  now that the slogan of Asian leaders for  economic development is "Asian Values  and Western Technology" which deprives  people of human and democratic rights.  Malaysia has been enjoying economic  growth, but numerous people have been  jailed, including indigenous people in  Sarawak, human rights activists like Irene  Fernandez who exposed the cruel treatment  of detained migrant workers, and intellectuals who were just recently detained under the Internal Security Act. This type of  economic development which sacrifices the  human rights of women, children and indigenous people is common to most Asian  countries.  It is important to confront global economic dominance of the powerful countries  in the North, but it is also necessary to criticize the countries in the South which follow the North, and to hold their governments accountable to the people. The international economic structure promoted  by APEC causes gross human rights violations and so much pain and agony unequal  and unjust. Moreover, it should be pointed  out that the wasteful consumption pattern  of people in the North is a part of development model that APEC promotes. Therefore, if we reject APEC, we should plan our  lifestyle around more sustainable models.  It is vital that women reject and resist  the APEC system, but it is also important  that women start working together to create an alternative development system  based on gender justice, ecological  sustainability and local-global democracy.  Already some women begun to take action  in many Asian countries, even if they are  still at the small-scale grassroots level. We  can learn from them and step forward to  envision an alternative future for the 21st  century where women's human rights are  guaranteed. For that purpose, human rights  should be strengthened through women's  day to day struggle.  Voices must be heard  We welcomed more than forty overseas participants from three continents and  twenty countries to the four-day International Conference on Violence Against  Women in War and Armed Conflict situations held in Tokyo. We have shared the stories of women from each of these countries  who have suffered sexual violence in war  and conflict situations which have taken  place in the past and continue until the  present time. We have shared their pain and  sorrow.  We have heard the reports of Japanese  military sexual slavery ("comfort women  systems"), the rape of Nanking, the sexual  brutality against tens of thousands of  women at the hand of Pakistani military  forces during the Bangladesh war for independence, the victimization of women  through the spraying of toxic chemicals by  US military forces during the Vietnam War,  and more recently, the mass rape of women  in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda,  the sexual violence against women under  the Indonesian military occupation of East  Timor, the military administration of  Burma, the Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan and Algeria, rape occurring  around US military bases, forced eviction  during situations of armed conflict.  Through these reports we have learned of  the various forms of violence suffered by  women during wars and regional conflicts  regardless of time and place.  In addition, these criminal acts against  women are not branded as war crimes,  have not been tried in war tribunals, and  the perpetrators have not been prosecuted,  enjoying impunity. Meanwhile, the women  victims have kept silent in fear of being  humiliated; with families and communities  concealing the abuse as their shame.  This "shame" extends to cases where  fathers killed their own daughters who had  been raped. It has been made clear that violence occurring during war and armed conflict situations represents the extension of  violence against women, which occurs on  a daily basis even in so-called "times of  peace" in male dominated societies, in the  form of domestic violence, sexual harassment and trafficking in women.  Recently with the growth of the women's movement, women survivors throughout the world have begun to raise their  voices. In particular, women survivors in  Korea and other countries of Asia who were  forced to become sex slaves ("Comfort  women") have come forward to break the  silence after fifty years.  In response, women in Japan have  launched a campaign to demand that the  Japanese government issue an official apology and pay compensation to the survivors.  We have learned how much the courage of  these women has served to empower  women victims during war times and  armed conflict in areas throughout the  world such as the former Yugoslavia.  The global women's movement clearly  established the human rights of women on  the occasion of the World Conference on  Human Rights held in 1993 in Vienna, and  at the end of the same year the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration of Elimination of All Forms of Violence Against Women, calling on states to  assume responsibility for eliminating all  forms of violence against women.  The 1995 Fourth World Conference on  Women in Beijing made clear in the platform of action that violence against women  during war and armed conflict constitutes  a war crime. In this situation, women have  organized to provide healing and support  for women survivors, have begun to address the issue of sexual violence in war  tribunals, and have begun to challenge war  tribunals in various parts of Asia including the Tokyo War Tribunal, from a  gendered perspective. .  This conference was held to ensure that  the voices of women victims are reflected  in the report to be submitted by the UN  Special Reporter on Violence Against  Women, Rhadika Coomaraswamy to the  UN Human Rights Commission in 1998.  There is a growing trend which seeks  to reverse the work leading up to the Beijing  Conference. [This backlash is] symbolized  by the attack discrediting the "comfort  women" as voluntary prostitutes by the  "Group to Study Liberal View of History"  in Japan, and emerging fundamentalist  forces which overlook violence against  women. However, women will no longer  be silenced.  In order to eliminate violence against  women during war and armed conflicts,  women at the global and national levels are  seeking to build a non-militarized world  by bearing the responsibility of creating a  peace based on women's human rights.  Furthermore, in their daily lives at home,  at their work sites, and in their communities, women are seeking to make changes  which combat discrimination and violence.  To achieve these long-term goals, we  seek to join with women addressing the issue of violence against women in war and  armed conflict throughout the world,  through achieving reform in international  legal systems such as international law and  the United Nations, and the establishment  of the International Criminal Court.  We also seek to strengthen the movement within Japan to address the "comfort  women" issue and force the Japanese government to accept legal responsibility, compensate, and support the survivors. We feel  that this will serve as a precedent to restore  honour and justice to women survivors of  wartime sexual violence.  Moreover, we join with women seeking to achieve the elimination of sexual violence resulting from the presence of foreign  military bases in their communities.  Next year is the 50th anniversary of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At  this conference, the proposal was made to  create a women's global network to protect women's human rights and to achieve  a society free of all forms of violence. Let  each of us take the first step as we join together in action with women.

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  Women and environmental destruction:  APEC greys the skies  by Sarojeni Rengam  Sarojeni Rengam is an environmentalist  working with the Pesticide Action Network-  Asia Pacific (PAN) in Malaysia. Her specific  areas of interests are the effects of industrial  agriculture and environmental devastation on  women and their communities.  In the 1980's, PAN started documenting  the impact of pesticides on women. Rengam  says this work necessarily includes rural women's issues, women in agriculture, women and  health, and trade liberalization and development issues.  Rengam was recently in Vancouver for the  2nd International Conference Against APEC.  Below is her plenary presentation.  I come from Malaysia which is known  to have a tropical climate, clear blue skies  and air that is relatively clean. But over the  past few months we have been facing a  problem—our skies are dull and grey. We  have to breathe in air that is filled with sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and some  particulate matters because of forest fires  in Indonesia.  In the beginning, the slash-and-burn  shifting cultivators were blamed for this  situation. People in Malaysia were saying:  "these are the culprits." But as it kept on  going for months the government finally  had to admit the real causes of the problem were transnational corporations and  other companies.  I am ashamed to say that a number of  Malaysian companies were very much involved in burning down thousands of hectares of tropical rainforests in Indonesia.  They cleared land to plant cash crops and  plantation crops.  Indonesia's "cheaper" labour force, so-  called cheap land (because it belongs to the  government), and a government that supports trade liberalization at any cost has  allowed this to happen. Because of the  greed of local and foreign companies, hectares of land are being burned and citizens  of many countries, not just Indonesia, but  Malaysia, Singapore and even the Philippines, are suffering.  This may have happened regardless,  but I think it is this current climate of trade  liberalization which gives massive power  to companies willing to invest. It also creates so-called comparative advantages  which pushes this kind of development on  countries particularly in the South.  Under this new wave of globalization  and liberalization, land is increasingly being converted from food crops to non-food  commercial crops, industrial zones, urban  centres, prawn farms and fancy projects  such as golf resorts. (Malaysia has more  than 300 golf courses for a population of  18 million, almost all of whom do not play  golf.) These conversions often result in  small farmers being forcibly thrown off  their land, violating their very basic human  rights.  Forest lands and the biodiversity that  supports the indigenous population are  being taken over by mining and logging  operations. The Philippines is a classic case  where huge tracts of indigenous peoples'  lands are being used up thrown mining and  logging. Imagine the entire population of  Australia turned out of their homes—18  million people losing their land, evicted  from their homes, deprived of their livelihood and income.  As families split up and spread out, the  community bonds crumble. Cut off from  their most vital resources, indigenous peoples are then robbed of their history, their  culture and their traditions. They may be  forced to adopt an alien diet, an alien culture and alien traditions. They have higher  rates of diseases and mortality, lower earning  capacity  and education,  and face more  joblessness,  discrimination  and an inferior  social status.  Oddly,  this happens in  the name of development and  the victims are  described as  "beneficiaries." It happened in India  during the period of 1951 to 1990, when more than 21.6  million people suffered precisely this fate.  They were displaced by just dams and canals alone. If you add mining to that, another 2.1 million people were displaced—  all totalled, that's almost the entire population of Canada being displaced.  What I would like to focus on today is  the emphasis that many of these so-called  "new tigers"—the countries inAsia which  have recently experienced high economic  growth rates—have been placing on the export of what they call 'high value crops'.  This high value cropping is being introduced on a massive scale in many countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia.  In the Philippines, the medium term  development plan is to accelerate the  growth and development of this horticulture industry. Good agricultural land is  being replaced—from food crops to horticulture products which are basically for  export.  In Malaysia, farming vegetables is being replaced by growing cut flowers. This  is done so consumers in the North can have  cut flowers all year round. [But for them to  have "choices"] means displacing the food  choices of people in the countries producing the goods.  Much of the horticulture industry is  dominated by transnational corporations.  Although women have traditionally been  actively involved in food production, the  agro-export industry is increasingly forcing women into rate-based work. The trend  of increasing the feminization of the rural  wage labour force has accompanied the globalization of food systems. If you look at  some of the figures, such as in Ecuador in  1991, 69 percent of workers in high value  crop production were women.  The production of these high value  crops are also characterized by the heavy  use of pesticides, fungicides, herbicides  and insecticides. The amount of chemicals applied is particularly high because  the crops are perishables: fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers.  A woman plantation worker in Malaysia said: "I use my bare hands to mix  pesticides; I don't know if doing it is  harmful to me in the long run, but I know  it burns my skin." And a woman in Central America said that when you work in  a planta-  worker is  identified  if their  nails drop  off because of  the use of  Paraquodine  in a lot of  the plantations."  The  victims  photo by Fatima Jaffer and survivors of such development and trade liberalization strategies are invariably small  farmers, landless workers, ethnic groups  and indigenous peoples. As always,  women are the worst affected. It is very  rare for a woman, especially in the South,  to own their own land. Women have very  few rights over land that is being taken  away from food production.  If you look at some of the figures on  poverty and rural women, you find that  rural women in the South are among the  poorest and most vulnerable people in the  world. The incidence of poverty among  them, in general, shows an upward trend.  In Asia alone, the number of poor rural  women living below nationally defined  poverty lines is estimated at 374 million.  So what are women doing about this?  They are not lying down; there is so much  resistance. In India, for example, women  take over some land—this was not actually very good agricultural land—but the  women's group worked on it, introduced  sustainable agriculture, regenerated the  soil, and was able to grow food for their  families. They call it Food From Stones.  There are also women actively trying to  save traditional seeds and to say 'no' to  transnational companies who want to  control their seeds.  Then there's mobilization taking  place against trade liberalization and the  "development" resulting from these new  trade regimes. In 1996 in Thailand, leading up to the Forum of the Poor, farmers  began assembling in front of the government house. There were more than 2,000  farmers who demanded the return of their  land which was confiscated for state development purposes 10 years earlier.  This protest was followed by one led  by people affected by the dam projects,  deforestation, eucalyptus plantations and  state development projects, and by labourers and slum people. The number that protested under the Forum of the Poor rose to  12,000 by the beginning of the April. At that  time, the Forum's petition to the government listed their concerns in four categories: the impact of dam projects, land and  forest management, state development  projects affecting residents, and health security for labourers.  The Assembly of the Poor, as it became  more popularly known, gathered in Bangkok again in October 1996 to hit home their  concerns. Thai peasant women have been  at the forefront of the activities of the Forum. Once somebody described the scene  to me. "Thai people are very sensitive to  tradition and culture and so they didn't go  shouting slogans, they didn't go drumming  their drums, they just sat there. They just  sat there in front of the parliament house  for days and days."  People from the rural areas would  come replace those who were already there.  Food was provided by grassroots organizations in Bangkok, by ordinary people. By  just sitting there, they embarrassed the government. The government had to come out  and talk to them. They started a dialogue  with the government. Not all the issues that  were presented by the people were met in  any significant way, but one of the things  the government has promised is support  for sustainable agriculture. They are  putting out big financial support to NGOs  [non-governmental organizations,] to get  more people, more farmers involved in sustainable agriculture.  These are some of the ways that farmers, women, people are organizing against  trade liberalization. Another has been the  alternative trading and alternative markets  that have been set up in many countries.  These are community supported agriculture. These are like the old system in Japan, the tokay system, where consumers  and farmers come together in an alternative market system; where farmers are committed to providing organic products or  products that do not have pesticides, and  where the community supports the livelihood of farmers. This has been a very good  way of exchange. There have been other  movements of fair trade that have taken  place elsewhere in Asia and other regions  that actually bypass all these new trade regimes.  We really need to counteract some of  the trade liberalization developments taking place. And so, the call is for a lot of  women to resist, then mobilize, then create  alternatives. And I think for us in particular, those from Malaysia, 1999 will be a critical year when the APEC leaders summit  comes to Malaysia. It will be a challenge  for NGOs and peoples' organizations based  in Malaysia to try and organize in a situation where there are so many difficulties for  NGOs even to sustain themselves. So, we'll  try to face the challenge next year, but in  the meantime we will continue resisting  these developments.  18  DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Feature  Indigenous women and the environment:  Nuclear waste targeted for  Western Shosone territory  by Winona LaDuke  The 1997 Honor the Earth Tour is over.  My suitcase is finally unpacked and I sit in  piles of paper, unopened mail and huge  lists of things to do. Life may have returned  to some normal level of hecticness, but  something inside me is more inspired, has  seen more terrible and more beautiful images than I have ever seen before, and in  my heart, I believe and know that courageous people make a difference.  This fall's concert was the third Honor  the Earth Tour headlined by the Indigo  Girls and featuring Native performers such  as Ulali, Keith Secola and his Wild Band of  Indians, John Trudell and Bad Dog, Jim  Boyd and the band Indigenous. The tour  began amidst blessing and traditional  Mohawk dancing on the Akwesasne  Mohawk Nation in upstate New York September 7. Twenty-one shows and twenty  five days later on October 2, the tour ended  in Missoula, Montana.  Sponsored by the Seventh Generation  Fund, the Indigenous Women's Network  and the Indigenous Environmental Network, Honor the Earth is an ongoing effort  to raise public awareness and financial support for grassroots Native environmental  initiatives. This year's tour did that and  more. "Honor the Earth was the most rigorous and demanding tour of our career,"  said Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls, recalling the high-paced schedule participants kept to insure broad media coverage  and public education. "It was also the most  inspiring."  Two tour buses and two vans drove  through the night from town to town along  the East coast for close to a month. Sometimes sleepy, yet determined musicians and  Native activists showed up each day after  a performance for editorial meetings at  daily papers, press conferences and special  events. Then there was the concert itself  which highlighted local and national Native speakers and included a 'call to action'  by the Indigo Girls, who assisted with the  distribution and collection of postcards to  key decision makers on specific Native environmental issues. Much of this was  broadcast on Honor the Earth's website,  which received more than one million  "hits" during the tour.  The primary focus of the tour was the  issue of nuclear waste storage on Native  lands. Every single proposal to build a radioactive waste dump in North America  right now targets Native territories, from  the remote Grassy Narrows and Meadow  Lake Reserves in Canada to the desert lands  of the Goshutes and Shoshones in the  American southwest.  Because of the big push by the nuclear  industry, Honor the Earth decided to centre its efforts around the critical issue of a  little known piece of legislation under consideration by Congress called the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act. This bill authoriszes the  mass transportation of high level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, primarily  located in the east, to Yucca Mountain, Nevada—a sacred place on Western Shoshone  territory. If this bill passes and is not vetoed by President Bill Clinton, casks of  waste, each carrying the radiological  equivalent of 200 Hiroshima bombs, will  be travelling by highway and railroad  within a half mile of the front lawns of 50  million Americans. And the nuclear industry will turn a sacred site into a radioactive  parking lot.  The Western Shoshone Nation is the  most bombed nation on earth because of  nuclear explosions conducted within the  Nevada Test Site, on their territory. Yucca  Mountain sits within the Test Site and is  part of the land base guaranteed the Nation in the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley The  community is united in its opposition to  any nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain.  Dumping nuclear waste in Indian  country, letting giant utilities eliminate their  liability for the waste and transporting it  through America's cities and towns is a bad  idea. That was the message of the Honor  the Earth tour. The musicians and activists  took that message to 20 communities and  to Washington, DC. More than 15,000 postcards to the president were collected requesting he uphold his promise to veto the  Nuclear Waste Policy Act when it comes to  his desk. The political impact of the cards  was buttressed by a national press conference in Washington, DC, a meeting with  White House staff on the issue, a show and  press conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, and  a visit to Western Shoshone land.  "For the first time, we got to speak to  people high up in Washington," said Virginia (Dedee) Sanchez, Director of the Citizen Alert Native American Program and a  Western Shoshone representative who  spoke at six concerts on the route. Sanchez  felt the tour gave her community a chance  to focus discussion on their issues and have  it make a difference. "At first I was really  nervous and didn't know what to expect.  And then I figured out this would really  help our community raise our issues.  Sanchez said, "It encouraged and enhanced  not only me personally, but our whole community: Western Shoshone Paiutes,  Margene Bullcreek from Goshute—we felt  inspired knowing we had backing on our  issues."  Sanchez wasn't the only Native  woman to have her voice heard. "We've  been trying to talk to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for at least ten years.  Letter after letter to EPA administrator  Carol Browner with the message sent in  many forms...this was the first time we ever  went to her office," Mohawk midwife Katsi  Cook explained.  Cook and the rest of the Mohawk community at Akwesasne want General Motors  to clean up their mess. For 15 years, GM  has tried to get out of cleaning up a  Superfund Site—one with 823,000 cubic  yards of highly toxic PCBs in it—adjacent  to their reservation. Those PCBs are in the  soil, the fish and the people.  At the meeting with Browner, Cook  forwarded a request that she come to  Akwesasne. Hopefully, 3,500 postcards urging the EPA to mandate the permanent  clean up of the GM dump will help get  Browner to make the visit and take some  steps to remedy the site.  Like the Mohawks, the Penobscots of  Maine have been asking the EPA for years  to stop the Lincoln Pulp and Paper Mill  from spewing dioxin into their waters. As  in the case of Akwesasne, Browner has ignored the issue.  Dioxin, a byproduct of bleaching paper white with chlorine, is the "most potent toxin" regulated by the EPA.  Penobscots and environmentalists have repeatedly asked the EPA to stop the estimated 40 million gallons of dioxin laden  water dumped into Maine rivers by paper  companies annually. Instead, the agency  has allowed the discharge of this poison to  This is about access. Although the Indigo Girls would prefer fans or decision  makers act from their hearts and not because a famous artist asked them to, celebrity pull does make a difference. Companies like General Motors and the pulp and  paper industry seem to have way more influence in Washington than Native Nations.  For instance, while the Mohawks participated earnestly in a process of clean up  negotiations between the state, federal government and GM, it was only GM's voice  that was heard. John Banks of the Penobscot  Nation has gone through the same grinding bureaucratic process with little result.  Action by celebrities like the Indigo Girls  may be a way to balance the scale.  Further down the tour route, Honor  the Earth stopped for a free concert on the  lands of the Eastern Band of Cherokee in  North Carolina, held three shows in Florida  to support the Independent Traditional  Seminole Nation's right to preserve their  way of life, and spent a day in a traditional  Seminole village. We visited the lands of  the Western Shoshone in Nevada, and  ended the tour in Montana by standing  with Native peoples as they strive to protect the Yellowstone buffalo herd from  slaughter.  The visits to Native communities were  the most moving aspect of tour, a respite  from the hectic schedule of concerts and  media interviews as well as a way to remember the purpose of our work. The Indigo Girls'Amy Ray reflects that "the time  spent in Indian communities was exciting  and humbling and gave us strength to carry  through the whole tour."  Honor the Earth was mutually rejuvenating for Native activists. "I think the  struggle that we work with here on a daily  basis in the community can be very grinding," says Katsi Cook. She laughs, "I can  get myself into a hole. This whole thing  picked our energy up and made us act very  quickly so that our best came out. The energy brought to us was very revitalizing."

DECEMBER/JANUARY 1998 Arts  Women and the Internet:  Useful guide to getting online  WORKING TOGETHER ONLINE  By Maureen James and Liz Rykert  Web Networks, Toronto, Ontario, 1997  by Penny Goldsmith   Last October I attended the Women's  Internet Conference in Ottawa and among  the many and varied workshops on networking online, my interest was piqued by  one offered by the Wild Web Women  (WWW) of Toronto entitled "Citizens for  Local Democracy." At that workshop, Liz  Rykert, Sherrie Tingley, Robyn Kalda, Sally  Gibson and Sonja Greckol told us the story  of how they are using the Internet to organize and mobilize people in Ontario  around the cuts the Conservative government of Mike Harris is inflicting on all levels of community.  I was struck in particular by the fact  that these women were not computer experts; they were community organizers  who were telling us how to use the technology to further the work we were already  doing. Online discussions were only one  forum for organizing around the megacity  bill in Toronoto, for example. Weekly meetings and newspaper broadsides were also  a regular part of the process.  Inspired by the workshop, I turned  again to the book I had bought and read  with enthusiasm only a week or so before  the confernece began: Working Together  Online. The book doesn't need a subtitle;  its title says it all. In plain language and  with clear and readble design by Anne  Jacobs and illustrations by Carolyn Gavin,  this working manual explains how to use  the technology practically. The authors,  both of whom have extensive experience  facilitating online discussion groups and  training community organizations on the  Internet, have structured the book to take  the reader from why go online, right  through to how to do it.  Because Rykert and James are community organizers not computer techies, they  know the barriers and conflicts community  organizations face when making the decision to go online. This is a c"computer  manual" that talks about who will be working in your online space and the politics of  government funding versus government  involvement in the space. The authors  stress the importance of analyzing how  your group works now, and how the technology can help that process by making  communicaiton cheaper, for example, or  letting people be involved in a discussion  when they have time, rather than at a specific meeting.  The book then goes into a detail about  what to do next. Again, the authors tell us  the options available, but spend most of  their time talking about the politics of communication: how to make people feel comfortable if they are not used to the medium,  whether or not to have someone facilitating or moderating discussions. They warn  the reader that there can be problems dealing with "techies" whose goal is to have  the system running smoothly. This isn't a  bad goal, but one that sometimes doesn't  take into account the various issues around  access. For example, you may need an older  version of an internet browser because not  all the participants in your group will have  spiffy computers with Windows 95 installed.  The chapter called "Strategies for  Working Together" will not be unfamiliar  to experienced commmunity workers. The  same issues are there: listening to each  other, creating a safe environment, developing ground rules, sharing resources and  being inclusive. Examples of online activities will give th reader ideas about how to  use online space. Appendices detail the specifics of how to use Web networks' system  to set up accounts.  This manual is expensive ($29.95) but  its worth the cost. It is a thorough,  unintimidating reflection of how we can  use the tools of technology without beibng  overwhelmed by them.  Web Networks is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing high quality  cost effective electronic communications  tools to social change communities and  non-profit organizations across Canada. It  has provided services to non-profit groups  and individuals involved in women's issues, environment, labour, human rights,  peace, social justice and international development since 1987.
