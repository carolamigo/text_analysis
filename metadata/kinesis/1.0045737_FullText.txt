IWD usually features a  march, rally, information day and fundraising dances. Additionally, many women's organizations plan individual IWD celebrations like a film festival, open house, conference, etc.  Organizing and publicizing these events  takes considerable work, but is very worthwhile, especially for women new to the city  or new to feminism. It is also an excellent  opportunity for women's groups to work together on a short-term project.  To our knowledge, there have not yet  been any organizing meetings for IWD '89  in Vancouver. We urge women who are interested to get together as soon as possible.  VSW will be a contact number for women  who want to work on IWD. Leave your  name and number with us and we will put  you in touch with each other. Call 255-5511  from Monday to Thursday 1-5 pm.  Funding for  lesbian projects  The Kimeta Society, a non-profit corporation founded in 1987, is committed  to funding projects advancing the hberation of lesbians and gay men. (Kimeta is  a Swahili word meaning "spark.") The Society is particularly interested in supporting Third World projects, and those which  have progressive political significance and  lack access to other funding sources.  In its first year of operation, Kimeta  helped fund the first conference of Latin  American Lesbian Feminists in Mexico, the  Simon Nkoli Anti-Apartheid Committee,  the Vancouver Lesbian Connection, and the  Canadian Women's Movement Archives,  among others.  For funding guidelines, applications or  simply more information, write Kimeta Society, Apt. 5. 291 Ontario St., Toronto ONT  M5A 2V8.  For a good  time, call VSW  Vancouver Status of Women is looking  for more women to join our organizing committees. If you want to work for women's  rights, but are not sure where to begin and  what issues to tackle, or if you're interested  in a whole range of issues—a VSW committee could be the best place for you.  Right now our committees include fund-  raising, programming, pohtical outreach  and finance. They meet individually about  once or twice a month (usually evenings) to  plan and follow through on a variety of activities. The focus of the committees for the  next year will be on women's poverty, family pohtics and immigrant women. And of  course we will be looking for ways to make  money to do our work.  We encourage all women to job us  and welcome immigrant women, disabled  women and women of colour. Our office and  washroom are wheelchair accessible, and we  pay for childcare. If you are interested or  want more information about VSW and its  committees, call Lea or Trisha at 255-5511  from Monday to Thursday 1 to 5 pm.  Attn: women in  performing arts  The Alhance for the Production of  Women's Performing Arts is planning a  weekend conference for Canadian women in  the industry. Scheduled for March 17-19,  1989 in Winnipeg, the conference will include a choice of workshops for artists, technicians and producers.  The workshops will provide hands-on instruction as well as opportunities for practical and creative exchanges of ideas. The  conference hopes to build awareness of the  roles which support the performing arts,  those of bookers, managers, producers, media workers, technicians, distributors, club  and theatre owners—as well as the performers themselves. Evening concerts will showcase women performers and be open to the  public.  If you are interested in attending, participating, performing or volunteering, call the  organizers at 204-453-6479.

V6R 4G5  Seeking women—  inventive women  The Woman Inventor's Project is planning a travelling exhibit on Canadian  women inventors. Called "Women Invent,"  the exhibit will show some of the most interesting inventions by women, especially  Canadian women, both historical and contemporary.  The exhibit will include three sections:  important technological inventions and discoveries by women; inventions related to  women's traditional work, such as childcare,  teaching, nursing and housework; and the  process of inventing, to illustrate the steps  involved in getting a product to market.  The main goals of the exhibit are to highlight the achievements of Canadian women  in the non-traditional fields of invention,  technology and science, and to convey a better understanding and appreciation of inventors and the process of invention generaUy.  The organizers are seeking names of individuals who have been involved in an invention or discovery, as weU as input into the  overall planning of the exhibit.

Goings and  comings  With this end-of-the-year issue of Kinesis, we find ourselves going through transitions, too. Pat Feindel, wonderful writer  and energetic Editorial Board member, has  decided to shed her Ed Board role. We're  sorry to see her go but, happUy, she won't be  gone: Pat intends to continue as a writer.  Nora D. Randall is laying her Beans column to rest. As usual, Nora tells this story  better than anyone (see page 12) although  she leaves out the part about how much  she'U be missed. Nora's column has been  a bright, thoughtful spot in the paper for  three years, and her loss wUl be felt. Not to  worry. We're not about to let Nora become  a Has-Bean: she too has promised to write  some more.  And finally, Nancy PoUak's seven-month  stint as editor is now over and she's going home. (That's about 14 blocks south-  by- south-east of the Kinesis office, she  thinks.) Esther Shannon is returning and if  she's added any new energy to her old, hold  onto your hats.  So long, Nancy. Welcome back, Esther.  P.S. We're having a party. See Bulletin Board for details.  ...*>   WOMEN'S    *. .

Just as free trade  wUl be anything but, the election  result was clearly less than a mandate to Brian Mulroney from the  Canadian people.  WhUe holding onto 169 parliamentary seats to the combined op  position's 126, the Conservatives  poUed only 43 percent of the popular vote. The anti-free trade New  Democrats and Liberals captured  20.4 and 31.9 percent respectively.  Only free trade math would  mistake these figures for a blessing  of Tory pohtics.  Yet blessed the Tories have  been, by a parliamentary redistribution that greased their ma  jority standing and by bludgeon-  style support from Canada's mainstream media.  Business interests granted Mulroney a very clear mandate. Commenting on the results, Margaret  BirreU said the new feature of  this election was "the overt, massive injection of corporate funds.  The role of corporations in pohtics is now clear." BirreU was cam-  Indeedy-do. On Sunday, November 6, over a hundred spirited lesbians (with their kids and supporters in tow) seriously disrupted the calm of Vancouver's Commercial Drive in a visibility parade  that was anything but serious. The occasion marked the end of International Lesbian Week, and  the mood was infectious: neighbours, passers-by and Sunday shoppers waved and honked right  back at the paraders, many of whom live in Vancouver's east end.  Everywoman's  Clinic doors finally open  by Joni Miller  Inside, the exits are secured  with heavy metal doors. A volunteer security guard stands  beside each one. There are no  windows—just a set of double  glass doors, reinforced with a  metal grill.  Outside, volunteer marshalls  line the wooden barricades,  wearing bright orange vests and  grim expressions. About 300  protesters parade, with picket  signs and gaudy pictures of  aborted fetuses.  Two men lean against the  outside wall, heads bowed,  mumbling prayers. "Dear Jesus let no blood be shed on this  ground today lord help the little babies."  A man spots me taking pictures and tells me there will  be politicians speaking at 2:30.  Paul Nielsen, the Tory hopeful for Vancouver East will be  there, and someone from the  Christian Heritage Party.  A row of motorcycle police  line the road. Two security police in plainclothes are wandering through the crowd. They  have been working with clinic  staff for several weeks. The  bomb squad has been through  the building.  The date is November 4>  1988. Abortion is legal. Eighty-  seven percent of Canadians  support a woman's right to  choose. Everywoman's Health  Clinic, B. C. 's first freestanding  abortion clinic, is finally opening its doors.  And it feels like we 're at war.  "Welcome to the majority,"  B.C. Coalition for Abortion Chnics (BCAC) spokeswoman Joy  Thompson said as the opening ceremony began. The clinic smeUed  of fresh paint—testimony to the  women who stayed up ■ most of  the night putting on the finishing  touches. The last of the ceiling tUes  were in place only shortly before  the doors opened.  As guests, media and recording equipment jockied for posi  tion, Thompson joked, "We should  have bought a bigger buUding."  She said Premier Vander Zalm and  Health Minister Peter Dueck had  declined to attend the event, then  read telegrams of support from  pro-choice groups. A series of short  speeches foUowed.  Darlene Marzari, NDP MLA for  Point Grey praised the coalition's  accomplishments. "Thank you on  behalf of our mothers' generation,  and ah the women who were rendered sterUe and sick for hfe because of botched abortions."  Margaret MitcheU, NDP MLA  for Vancouver East was also in  attendance. "I'm dehghted—very  pleased the chnic is finally open,"  she said.  Alderwoman Libby Davies and  Astrid Davidson, Director of Programs for the B.C. Federation of  Labour also spoke.  "If you knew the calls I've received over the years from desperate women ..." said Davidson,  reiterating that services should be  government-funded.

In the last weeks of the election,  business invested millions in pro-  free trade messages "in the media,  by direct maU, on the shop floor,"  said BirreU. "It was the pohtics  of fear ... Big business delivered  for Mulroney, now he'U deUver for  them."  Canadian women can also expect a number of Mulroney deliveries: already, he has promised  speedy re-introduction of his  much-maligned chUd care legislation.  |        A move to re-criminalize abor-  •§.   tion is also on the Tory agenda  According to a Globe and Mail  report, 74 members of the new  parliament are rigidly anti-choice  and likely to support legislation  to 'protect' the fetus from conception. (Of the 20 new anti-choice  members, 18 are Liberals.)  Anti-choice groups worked to  defeat several pro-choice candidates and may have influenced  the losses of Liberal Lucie Pepin  and the NDP's Lynn McDonald  and Marion Dewar. Pepin and Dewar were the spokespersons on  women's issues for their parties.  Pro-choice groups aren't particularly concerned about the extremists in parliament. Robin  Rowe of the Canadian Abortion  Rights League noted that, because  of their limited numbers, "on airee  vote, they're going to have trouble getting anything passed." The  concern, however, is with any legislation limiting women's access to  safe abortion.  The Tories plainly have no mandate to introduce criminal legislation around abortion, said BirreU, because during the campaign,  "that issue was never discussed.  The heat now has to come on aU  parties, saying no abortion law."  The heat must also come on  around the Meech Lake accord.  Barely mentioned by politicians  outside Quebec's borders, the accord is finally in the news with a  vengeance, as Mulroney calls for  its speedy passage, and the provincial NDP and Liberals in Manitoba and New Brunswick demand  amendments.  see Federal page 4  Charter, court  fails young woman  by Anna Blume  A young woman in Kamloops  has learned, the hard way, how  Canada's Charter of Rights and  Freedoms can shield a sexual  abuser.  Starting when she was 14-years  old, Karen (not her real name)  was coerced into sexual activities by her foster father of four  years. When the situation became  known to authorities, the man was  charged under section 153 of the  Criminal Code.  Section 153 dealt with "male  persons" who had "Ulicit sexual intercourse" with their foster daughters, step-daughters and female  wards."  On October 11 of this year, the  B.C. Supreme Court in Kamloops  struck down section 153 after the  man's defence lawyer argued the  section violated the Charter by  discriminating between male and  female accused and complainants.  Lawyer David Paul claimed  that, if the sexes of the people  in this case were reversed, there  would have been no charge.  Crown prosecutor Katherine  Le Reverend unsuccessfuUy countered that whUe the section  did indeed create gender distinctions, those distinctions were  neither unjust, unreasonable or  unjustifiable—an argument the  Charter permits.  Section 153 was replaced by a  "gender neutral" amendment in  1988 but was applied to this case  due to when the offences occured.  The man was also charged with  gross indecency and  sexual as  sault. The gross indecency charge  was dismissed at a preliminary  hearing for "lack of evidence,"and  in the subsequent sexual assault  trial by jury, the man was acquitted on grounds that no force or coercion had been used.  Due in part to the fact the sexual assault trial was stiU pending,  the Crown decided not to appeal  this ruhng on Section 153.  In an interview with Kinesis,  Karen, now 17, said she felt "angry, hurt and scared" by her court  experience. Karen testified for a  gruelling five hours at the trial and  described the man's defence trial  lawyer Peter Jensen as "the toughest guy around."  Karen's present foster mom  supported her throughout the ordeal. Said Dorothy (not her real  name), "Jensen was very subtle,  never argumentative. Karen just  sort of withdrew ... she got to a  point where she would answer 'yes'  or 'no' to anything."  Karen had to endure alot of  nastiness at school, as weU. "I'd  walk down the halls and people would always be saying mean  things. I couldn't handle it. I'm a  kind-hearted person and if someone pressures me, I shut up real  quick."  Karen switched schools because  she "didn't want to go through the  year feehng it was my fault." Her  new friends "know, but they treat  me half-decent. I'm at ease there."  As for her ex-foster parent,  Karen said, "He should have gone  to jaU to think about what he did.  He was bad."  KINESIS Across B.C.  Vancouver  Back to right at City Hall  by Vera Ritt  In an election that saw fewer  than 50 percent of possible voters actually voting, mayor Gordon CampbeU and a Non-Partisan  Association-dominated municipal  council were returned to Vancouver city haU on November 19.  CampbeU's weU-monied campaign against COPE/Civic NDP  candidate Jean Swanson was boosted by the low voter turn-out, particularly in Vancouver's east side.  The new maU-in voter registration  system had been highly criticized  by representatives from the city's  poorer, more transient neighbourhoods.  According to Donna Morgan  of the Grandview/Woodland Area  CouncU, "People were disenfranchised by the registration process  ... part of the election results  were due to that."  Morgan also lamented the defeat of the ward system proposal  (56.5 percent voted yes; a 60 percent vote was required), but observed "it wasn't a very good proposal, anyway." The Downtown  Eastside, Strathcona and Grand-  view/Woodlands would have been  lumped into a single ward, rather  than separate ones for each distinct neighbourhood.  CampbeU's cheery bUlboards  sported the message, "The Nonpartisan Approach is Working," a  slogan considered by many to be  dishonest on more than one level.  (The NPA has a warm association  with the Socreds).  Said Pat Davitt, active in the  Vancouver and Region Municipal  Employees Union, "What that slogan really says is there was httle controversy at city hall because  the opposition on council was so  smaU ... It worked very weU for  developers.  "A dictatorship, quite frankly,  works even better."  The opposition on council wiU  be stronger this term. The Committee of Progressive Electors  (COPE) gained a third alderman  (sic) with Harry Rankin rejoining  Libby Davies and Bruce Eriksen.  The NPA's Sandra WUking, active  in the Chinese-Canadian community, is council's only newcomer.  The NPA wUl continue with  majorities on school and parks  boards, albeit smaUer ones—  COPE's Pauline Weinstein and  the Civic NDP's Anne Beer won  school trustee seats; Pat Wilson  is the lone COPE parks commissioner.  CampbeU's first term of office  was marked by million-doUar budget cuts affecting health and social  services, the planning department  and garbage/recycling services, to  mention a few.  Says Davitt about this next  term: "The city has already made  its ideological point about cutbacks. At this time, social ser  vices are in a shambles [thanks to  the provincial government] and the  city is absolutely refusing to pick  up any of the services.  "It's not so much a matter of  [more] cutbacks, as no attempt to  improve services."  The question of equal pay for  work of equal value—pay equity—  is hkely to land in council's lap this  term. Says Davitt, "Pay equity is  an issue that demands a pohtical  decision, not simply a negotiated  [union] one."  In December, if COPE has its  way, city hall wUl be dealing with  the hot-lunch program for hungry school chUdren which was narrowly rejected by the previous  council. Aid. Davies is expecting  that, with the new support of  Rankin and WUking, the program  wiU finaUy pass.  The issue of affordable and  available housing wiU continue to  dominate the agenda of women of  the Downtown Eastside Women's  Place, a concern the pro-development CampbeU councU is unlikely to share. During the election, a leaked city report revealed a massive—and growing—  shortage of housing for low and  moderate income households.  Asked by Kinesis what they  hoped for from city hall, the  women responded, "We hope they  hear us, that they put avenues into  place to hear us ... and increase  grants to our community."  Promoting the healthy,  modern office  by Susan Fell  A casual look at a modern office would give the impression it is  a clean and safe place in which to  work.  Not so, according to Lynn  Bueckert and Lois Weninger, coordinators of the Clerical Workers'  Health and Safety Project. In fact,  a clerical worker can be seriously  disabled by her job and her working environment.  The Project has developed a series of workshops for office workers  who are concerned about their environment. I attended the first of  these workshops, held in November. An enthusiastic group of  downtown office workers also attended.  "Through the workshops, we  hope to promote and buUd a network of support for and with clerical workers," said the organizers. "Through the network, clerical workers wiU encourage and  assist each other in dealing with  workplace health issues."  The sessions were keyed to  a three-part strategy: recognizing  a problem exists, analyzing the  workplace, and developing strategies for change. Included in a substantial package of handouts were  materials verifying the specific  hazards in office work, and listing resources avaUable to women  who want to improve conditions in  their own offices.  Participants were encouraged to  share their experiences with the  group. Ultimately, said Bueckert  and Weninger, it is the workers' perception that their office is  unhealthy—and not any so-called  objective measure that determines  the need for change.  The first of the four sessions  gave us an overview of the problems in office work. Many clerical  workers, trapped in the myth that  office work is "clean and safe," beheve that if they are sick, it is because they themselves are somehow flawed and defective.  In this session, we were encouraged to express our concerns and  ideas about offices, and were given  exercises to take home, which allowed us to evaluate our workplace  and identify its hazards.  The second session focussed on  ventUation problems. Many of us  identified the air in our workplaces  as an important issue. We learned  that the objective standards which  determine if office air is clean and  safe actuaUy changed when her-  meticaUy sealed office buUdings  were buUt. The ventUation systems serving these offices are often  badly designed and inadequate. In  addition, many of the substances  women work with in these airless  offices are themselves dangerous.  The third session covered the  offices' physical surroundings: fur-  J-[EALTH ami SAFETY  niture, computers, hghting and  noise. Poorly designed furniture,  we learned, can cause some of the  most immediately obvious and disabling of work injuries: damage to  the hands, wrists, shoulders and  back.  The fourth session covered the  insidious and widespread health  problems caused by stress, and  ended the series with the sharing of visions and proposals for  change.  Throughout the series, we were  encouraged to share our experiences with the group. Concerns  ranged from the large number  of aUergies that develop in office workers with no previous history of aUergies, to an uneasy feeling that there was something "unhealthy" about the office.  One woman told about a group  of clerical workers who were  trapped in an airless basement  when a power faUure shut down  the ventUation system on which  they depended for air.  More workshops are scheduled for the new year at  Kwantlen College. For information, contact Lynn Bueckert  or Lois Weninger at 430-0458.  Clinic from page 3  Thompson outUned some of the  coalition's ideals and plans. The  clinic wUl offer pre- and postabortion counselling, translation,  safe houses for women travelling  from out of town, escort services,  lab, ultrasound, the safest and  least intrusive methods, and nursing care.  Because the province has refused core funding for the clinic,  women wUl be charged for services  on a sliding scale.  The regular fee for women  without B.C. Medical coverage  is $250, women with coverage  $150. Women who cannot afford  to pay the Ml fee wUl not be  turned away—hence the ongoing  fundraising.  Currently, 34 percent of chents  at Washington state clinics are  Canadian. An abortion in a U.S.  clinic costs around U.S. $300, plus  travel. The advantage in the past  has been quick service, local anaesthetics, and no questions asked.  With the opening of Everywoman's Health Chnic, B.C. women now have the option of being;  cared for inside the province.  Three Weeks Later  They called from aU over B.C.  and as far away as Edmonton.  "Our phone hnes were barely open  when women began booking appointments," said Hilda Thomas  of the BCAC.  Coalition members have been  busy since Nov. 4. Equipment has  been installed, and staff hiring fi  nalized. Dr. Lorena Kanke is the  medical director; an administrator, counseUor, staff doctor, two  nurses and relief staff have also  been hired.  The chnic enjoys a good response from neighbours, but anti-  choice protestors are a worry.  As Kinesis goes to press, rumour has it "Operation Rescue"—  a Washington-based group—may  be planning protests.  The organization uses what  it calls "passive obstruction"—  groups of people who sit in front  of doorways and block access.  "We wUl not be interfering with  peaceful protests," said Thomas,  "but if anyone attempts to prevent  women from entering the chnic,  we'll be looking for help from pohce."  A core of volunteer escorts and  marshalls is being organized. The  chnic is also looking for safe  houses—rooms where out-of-town  women can spend a night or two,  preferably within a 20-block radius  of the chnic.

Federal from page 3  In its present form, the constitutional accord is considered seriously flawed by women's and Native groups, the two territories—  and advocates of strong, federal  social programs. Its passage requires the unanimous approval of  the ten provinces; only Manitoba  and New Brunswick have yet to  sign.  Women's groups have been ap-  paUed by the federal NDP's unqualified support for Meech Lake,  support which seemed largely  based on luring the Quebec voter.  (The accord would bring Quebec  "into the constitutional fold" under terms the province finds ac  ceptable.) "We have to try to get  the NDP to reverse their stand on  Meech Lake," said BirreU.  As for free trade, opponents are  dismayed by what appears to be  near-total acquiesence by the NDP  and Liberals to the Tory plan to  ram the deal, unaltered, through  parliament by January 1, 1989.  "We should be pushing for a referendum [on free trade] now," said  BirreU who beUeves a truly grass  roots referendum campaign could  be won by the anti-free trade side.  "We couldn't really have expected  to change people's voting patterns  [in the election], so two votes are  needed."  4 KINESIS ACROSS  B.C.  Welfare  Fighting the cuts  by Jennifer Bradley  On the first night of every  month, poverty advocates wiU  gather on the steps of the Vancouver Art GaUery in a candlelight vigU to protest the reduction  in welfare to families whose parents the Ministry of Social Services  and Housing has deemed "employable."  An across-the-board cut of $50  took effect October 26 and spares  only families with two chUdren under the age of six years or a baby  under 6 months.  A parent with one six-month  old baby would have received a  $370 support aUowance for October, but only $320 for November. Hardest hit are single parents,  most of whom are women.  The cuts, according to Patricia Chauncey of the ChUd Poverty  Action Committee, "represent the  vUest form of sexism."  Ministry officials stated the cuts  were not appealable but that recipients could ask their workers to  re-evaluate their classification and  cuts would not occur without individual review.  Many women hit by the cuts  have not, asserts Chauncey, seen  their financial or social worker for  months.  Furthermore, women are reluctant to chaUenge decisions made  by the same official on whom they  depend for future help.  Their fear is not only financial.  As Chauncey says, "The biggest  risk facing women on welfare is the  apprehension of their chUdren."  Ministry officials explain the  cuts as a mechanism to motivate welfare recipients to take advantage of ministry-sponsored employment and training programs.  Chauncey states the cuts are a  "form of economic violence against  poor women and a punitive move  to force them into poorly paid,  dead-end jobs."  Two Vancouver women have  chosen to take the provincial government to court. Anita Archam-  bault, mother of two, is protesting to the Supreme Court of Brit  ish Columbia that she has been denied her right to use the ministry's  own appeal process. Her case wUl  be heard January 9.  Her lawyer, Carolyn McCool of  the Legal Services Society, points  out that because the cuts affect  primarUy single mothers whose  chUdren are of a certain age, they  "ultimately represent sexual and  age discrimination." She expects a  decision on the matter to establish  a precedent.  Deborah PeUetier wiU contend  that, as a result of the cuts, her  chUdren, ages 15, 10, 7 and 5 are  being "denied equal benefit and  protection," contrary to Section 7  of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Her lawyer, David Mossop  of the Community Legal Assistance Society, wUl argue that cuts  based on the designation employable/unemployable and are unconstitutional.

Family court counsellors  face privatization  by Noreen Shanahan  Socred plans to privatize FamUy Court CounseUors (FCC), ori-  ginaUy slated for early in 1989,  have evoked strong criticisms from  both the legal and women's community.  "There has been no advanced  planning regarding the type of  privatization, user-fee structure,  non-sexist counselling, and ah the  other ramifications that are inherent when moving without forethought," said Dorothy Gardiner  of the Tamitik Status of Women in  Kitimat in a letter to MLA Dave  Parker last July.  If privatization goes ahead,  para-legal Pearl McKenzie of the  North Shore Information and Volunteer Centre doubts women wUl  receive sympathetic and realistic  counselling essential during the  emotionaUy vulnerable period after a marriage breaks up.  FamUy Court CounseUors, employed under the Corrections  Branch of the B.C. Solicitor General, presently serve a dual purpose: they mediate (for both  spouses) on a number of family  (will) safeguards  be in place  after  privatization?  matters such as custody and access, and if mediation faUs and  the parties go to court, they'U  hkely prepare a court report on the  client's history.  "At least now there are some  standards applicable across the  province," she says, "with FCC's  trained in the same place, with the  same pohcy manual. Can we be assured these safeguards wUl be in  place after privatization?"  According to one source working in the field (who, for job  security reasons, requested total  anonymity), although privatization hasn't yet occurred, certain  other legislative changes over the  past year have significantly increased the hardships faced by her  chents.  "For example, there are now  three different services. There's  the FamUy Maintenance Enforcement Unit (a recently privatized sub-section of the Ministry  of Social Services and Housing),  the GAIN Amendment workers  (MSSH workers responsible for obtaining maintenance from a recipient's spouse—a mandatory program for women on assistance),  and the FamUy Court Counsellors."  This creates nothing short of  utter chaos, she says, where an  emotionaUy distraught woman is  treated as simply another administrative duty on someone's already  overfuU workload.  "If a woman registers her court  order with the FamUy Maintenance worker (not a mandatory  program) she first needs to fiU in  a 9-page application, and is given  no assistance in doing this. Then  FamUy Maintenance gets her a  lawyer and sends her into court.  IS. her husband contests the settlement they won't deal with him,  but send him over to the FamUy  CounseUors."  FCC's are not permitted to deal  with the woman if she's in the  FamUy Maintenance program, but  instead must work with her husband.  "What you have is two people  with aU sorts of problems dealing  with two agencies—the end result  is utter confusion."  Although the enforcement program has only recently been implemented she's heard 'lots of complaints' from women about it's ineffectiveness.  The GAIN Amendment Act not  only deprives a woman of independence, she says, but further com-  pUcates her hfe in terms of maintenance decisions.  "Previously she'd apply for welfare and they'd send her to FCC  where together we'd negotiate  maintenance. It's now Ulegal for  a woman on welfare to decide on  amount of maintenance, variation  of amount, or it's enforcement."  Rumours are flying as to when  the privatization of FamUy Court  CounseUors wUl occur. Tenders  were originally set to go out in  September with a projected 'date  of sale' in January. This didn't  happen.  Wendy GaUaway of the Solicitor-General's office "wouldn't  want to predict [the date of sale]."  Having recently presented a study  of privatization to cabinet, her department is now awaiting their decision.  Employment Equity a bust?  by Donna Butorac  The first batch of annual reports from companies affected  by the Employment Equity Act  (EEA, 1985), released in October, show that many of Canada's  largest employers appear to be doing httle to offset employment discrimination against women, people  of colour, Native people and the  disabled.  The Act requires that all feder-  aUy regulated industries with 100  or more employees submit details  of the representation of the four  target groups in occupational categories, salary levels, hirings, promotions and terminations.  The reports show that most employers affected by the act have  continued to hire and promote  white, able-bodied men for more  desirable or better paying jobs.  Major banks, such as the Toronto Dominion, The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the  Royal Bank show salary rates and  hiring patterns where women continually lag behind men.  This pattern is repeated at BeU  Canada and B.C. Tel, where more  than 75 percent of women earn less  than $30,000, whUe more than 85  percent of men make more than  this.  Nine of Canada's largest companies hired 13,000 fuh-time employees in 1987, only 94 of whom were  disabled. This represents a hiring  rate of less than one percent, yet  close to eight percent of the avaUable work force is disabled.  The reports also show continued under-employment of people  of colour and Native people.  The question now is, wUl the  Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) be taking any action  against these companies to ensure  that discriminatory practices are  reversed?  Answers are predictably vague,  and indeed bear out many of the  earlier criticisms of the EEA made  by women's groups and affected  minorities, that it provides no  sanctions against companies that  are found to be discriminating.  Please see EEA page 6  KINESIS , Across Canada  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Donna Butorac  Women, young  people at bottom  Women and young people are taking the  biggest share of the rapidly increasing number of jobs at the bottom end of the wage  scale.  According to a new Statistics Canada  itudy, one third of all new jobs created between 1981 and 1986 paid $5.24 an hour or  less, and whUe the male shift was mainly towards the top of the wage distribution scale,  the female shift was towards the bottom.  The reason for this becomes readUy apparent when the statistics are considered in  relation to a study published by the Canadian Labour Market and Productivity Centre in its latest quarterly review. The report  states that since 1981, virtuaUy aU of the 1.2  million new jobs created in the Canadian  economy have been in the service sector.  Women have traditionaUy been and continue to be over-represented in service sector employment, currently comprising more  than half of aU the workers. This sector consistently records the lowest wages of any employment sector—average hourly earnings  are less than three-quarters of the average  across the economy, and less than two-thirds  of the average in the goods-producing sector.  Furthermore, the study showed the service sector continues to be characterized by  a high degree of part-time, and fewer unionized jobs, both of which greatly disadvantages workers.  Bad law has  bad consequences  BUl C-49, the anti-prostitution legislation, is not working, says a recent Justice  Department report.  The number of prostitutes working in  Calgary, Regina and Winnipeg haven't diminished nor have types of services, prices  and locations where prostitutes work. It  also suggests in Regina and Winnipeg the  numbers of prostitutes have probably risen  slightly since the law came into force.  BiU C-49 is a controversial attempt to  crack down on street prostitution by making it Ulegal to communicate for the purpose of prostitution. Both prostitutes and  their customers can be charged.  The report finds that BUl C-49 is unfairly applied. Although both prostitutes  and their chents can be charged, arrests  have typicaUy been directed against hookers. This inequality could lead to another  constitutional challenge, the authors say,  because the Charter of Rights and Freedoms  requires equal treatment under the law.  The report recommends anti-soliciting  laws be revised to let municipalities regulate prostitute's work areas, to avoid clashes  between hookers and residents. It also suggests prostitutes work through escort services rather than street-walking. Certain  forms of off-street prostitution should be li-  censed, the report adds, which would provide for better health controls.  Protesting  NATO terror  For the last three years, the Innu people  of Labrador and Quebec have been waging  a campaign of civU disobedience against the  increased militarization of their homelands  by NATO fighter planes.  The military base at Goose Bay in  Labrador has been in operation since World  War II; however, the 1980's has seen a rapid  increase in its use for low-level flights by  NATO airforces.  According to Daniel Ashini, chief of  about 800 Labrador Innu from Sheshatshit,  this has had a dramatic impact on the Innu  way of hfe. "We are close to social collapse,"  he told delegates to a convention in Kamloops early October. "The experiences over  the last 7 years have left our people fragUe  and damaged."  In recent weeks more than 200 Innu  women and men have been arrested in nonviolent protests at Goose Bay. Ashini says  that most Canadians are unaware of the  militarization of the region and its effects  on the wUdlife that has sustained the Innu  for thousands of years. The NATO training exercises can involve hundreds of tree-  top level flights over Innu land daily. The  ear- shattering sound emitted by the planes  comes without warning, and is terrifying to  both humans and animals.  Charter of Rights  helps privileged  The majority of successful anti-discrimination court challenges are not of value to  minorities and disadvantaged groups, according to Kathleen Ruff, director of a federal program to finance constitutional litigation by such groups.  The sections of the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms that guarantee equahty rights  came into effect in 1985. Yet of the 54 successful cases brought before the Supreme  Court last year, according to Ruff, only 18  were of value in setting precedents for minorities or disadvantaged groups.  Examples of cases which did nothing to  help such groups were: those where the litigants were large companies; cases in which  men chaUenged "discriminatory" Criminal  Code of Canada provisions that afforded  special protection for women, such as a  law shielding the identities of aUeged rape  victims; and a case in which non-Native  fishers in B.C. argues that special fishing  rights granted to Native fishers discriminated against them.  None of these litigants could be considered to represent societaUy disadvantaged  groups, yet these, and many other such  cases are dominating anti-discrimination  court hearings. The costly nature of constitutional challenges has also hindered disadvantaged groups, according to Ruff.  No province has set up an equivalent to  the federal Court Challenges Program, the  program Ruff heads. She finds this shocking. "A great many important cases involve  provincial legislation, but we are not allowed to fund them. There has to be a  real effort made to make sure disadvantaged  groups get to use the Charter."  m    caros*  IVRECORBS  Rural Dignity  fights back  Moves to privatize Canadian postal services have had a disastrous impact on  women, according to Lynn Kaye, president  of the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC).  In hght of the federal election and the  Tory government's assumption of a clear  mandate to proceed in its free trade deal  with the U.S., further privatization is hkely  in this area. Postal services were part of the  free trade deal untU last July and Kaye says  there is every reason to beheve they wUl  emerge quickly in further negotiations, once  the deal is in place.  253-0913  Canada Post has already contracted out  aU cleaning work, which is mostly done by  immigrant women. While workers have been  hired back on by the private contractors,  they have lost their union status and been  forced to renegotiate contracts. This has resulted in wage cuts, from $10 to $4 or $5  per hour, for the same work.  The closing of rural post offices under  the privatization scheme has also deeply  affected women, since 83 percent of rural  postmasters are women. Where this has occurred, the contract is offered to a local  business for as httle as a quarter of what  the postmaster was paid. An organization  call Rural Dignity has formed to fight this  privatization.  As a move against further privatization  of postal services, NAC wants a moratorium on the closing of rural post offices,  the restoration of services to communities  already affected, and the reinstatement of  those who have lost their jobs.  EEA from page 5  The Chief Commissioner of the CHRC,  Max Yalden, said the commission has informed 11 employees it wants to do joint  reviews of anomalies in their records, thus  choosing to work with companies breading  the law, rather than file complaints against  them.  "I have nothing against confrontation,"  Yalden said. "But we think we are going  to make more headway if we have their cooperation."  This is a somewhat different stance to  that taken by Yalden upon bis appointment  earlier this year, when he said he would hke  to see the commission take a more active  and activist role against systemic discrimination.  At that time he said, "the Canadian Human Rights Act does after aU empower  the commission to launch complaints on its  own initiative. H we can detect reasonable  grounds to think that there is a systematic  type of discrimination, we should go on the  offensive and try to do something about it."  In hght of the published employer reports, the CHRC doesn't seem to be getting  very "offensive."  Instead, it wUl stiU be up to individuals to file complaints with the commission  about discriminatory employment practices  of Canadian companies, and voluntary—not  mandatory—affirmative action remains the  order of the day.  KINESIS Across Canada  A place for safe and natural births  by Leslie Kenny  In Ontario, yet another free-standing  'clinic is waiting to come on the scene.  A group calling itself the Toronto Birth  Centre is seeking facilities from which to operate specialized services for women in pregnancy and chUdbirth. One of the primary  goals of the Birth Centre, says group president Karen Walker, is to "reclaim normal  births."  Walker describes the group's concept as  "basicaUy similar to the midwifery concept,  that is, offering fuU continuity of care to the  mother."  "Continuity of care" is a basic theme  of midwifery which describes the midwife's  commitment and avaUabUity to a pregnant  woman for aU aspects of pre-natal care,  labour and birth, and ongoing post-natal  support.  Under the present hospital system, Walker explains, "a woman may see one doctor  for her pre-natal care, but wiU be assisted  during labour and birth by a hospital staff  unfamiliar to her."  Reduced medical intervention is another  goal of the centre. It would not be equipped  to give either caesarean sections or epidurals (a commonly administered spinal injection which freezes a woman's body to reduce the pain of chUdbirth). The centre wUl  be a place for healthy women to have safe,  natural birth.  Finally, as a concept with wide consumer  support, Walker says the centre has a mandate to maintain consumer control through  responsiveness to individual women and to  the community. With a board of directors  as weU as a midwife and physician staff in  place, there are certain legal and financial  obstacles which need to be cleared before  the centre can open its doors.  Legalizing Midwives  Midwifery advocates in Ontario are hold  ing their breath over pending legislation  from the Ministry of Health. Nearly three  years have passed since the ministry gave  approval in principle to recommendations  from the Chief Coroner and the Ontario  Midwifery Task Force calling for the fuU implementation of midwifery services into the  province's health care system.  With no legislation to date, the government recently appointed nurse-midwife  Karyn Kaufman to act as a Director of Implementation for the midwifery profession.  Commenting on the delay, Kaufman explains that the midwifery legislation now  faUs in with the Health Professions Legislation Review underway in the ministry. "It's  part of a large package that wUl overhaul  the regulation of 25 different health professions in the province."  Part of the review package includes the  Independent Health Facilities Act which  wUl govern the hcensing of out-of-hospital  health services such as those offered by  abortion and other free-standing chnics.  How far we've come: caricature of an 18th century "man-midwife"  who attended deliveries wearing women's clothing under which he  concealed his instruments, so as not to frighten the patients.  "Abortion pill" now on the scene  by Terrie Hamazaki  The uteruses of women worldwide are  once again under the microscopic scrutiny  of the anti-choice movement. This time,  their attention has been drawn to a so-  caUed abortion pUl known as RU-486, manufactured by the Paris-based pharmaceutical company, Roussel-Uclaf.  Roussel-Uclaf is part of the giant West  German chemical group Hoescht, which  holds the majority share. The French government has a 36 percent share.  On October 26, a month after receiving authorization to market the pUl under  the name Mifepristone in France, the com  pany abruptly withdrew the drug because of  threats from anti-abortion groups to launch  a world-wide boycott of the firm's products.  The next day, Roussel-Uclaf was ordered  to resume production of RU-486 by French  government officials who called the pUl the  moral property of the women of France.  The Chinese government approved the  drug for use at the same time.  The pUl works by blocking the action  of progesterone, a hormone essential to the  maintenance of pregnancy. Researchers say  it is effective in the first seven weeks of  pregnancy, particularly when used in conjunction with a second product called Sul-  protone, or prostaglandin E. One of the  major effects of progesterone is to mature  the lining of the uterus so the egg can be  implanted. When progesterone's action is  blocked, the uterus sheds its lining. Any  egg that might have been fertUized and implanted in that lining is shed along with that  lining.  The drug's reported side effects include  strong uterine contractions when the abortion occurs, slight nausea and fatigue.  According to officials at Health and Welfare Canada, Roussel Canada Inc. has not  yet sought federal approval to market the  drug in Canada. But once application is  made, it would have to undergo vigorous  and extensive testing. No studies to determine long-term risk have been done on the  drug, said Leah Taylor of the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective.  RU-486 wiU become another option for  women who have made a decision to terminate a pregnancy, said Marcine Levine of  Planned Parenthood, B.C. But it would not  be used as a form of birth control due to its  effects on a woman's menstrual cycle if used  on a regular basis. Rather, it would be used  as a one-time emergency treatment, under  strict medical supervision.  The Geneva-based World Health Organization noted that about 500,000 women die  each year from pregnancy-related causes.  And as many as 200,000 of those deaths are  due to botched abortions. MeanwhUe, anti-  choice groups condemn the pUl as a 'death  drug.' The RU-486 may be a good thing for  women if it's safe, said Taylor.  A strong enough counter-lobby from the  medical establishment opposed to midwifery could influence the scope of the legislation and possibly block the self-regulating  status sought by the centre.  Also of concern is the issue of funding.  Karen Walker says the centre has so far "resisted opening because we don't want people to have to pay. We beheve that midwifery services should be fuUy covered by  provincial health insurance."  While there is no definite timetable for  action, Kaufman adds that a Midwifery  Act, the first phase in specifying the scope  of the practice, wUl appear soon, "probably  in the spring."  Speaking for the B.C. Midwifery Task  Force (a multi-discipUnary consumer lobby  group), Vancouver nurse-midwife Carol  Hird states, "We are at a stalemate with  the present government. The report is sitting on the health minister's desk. I don't  even know if he's read it."  Asked to comment on the idea of birthing  chnics, Hird said, "We support alternative  birth centres as one of our positions, although they would have to be close to hospitals. Right now we just want to get the  legislation."  Co-op Radio  disputes  ruling  by Noreen Shanahan  Women's programming at Vancouver Cooperative Radio (CFRO-FM) is threatened  by a recent ruhng by the Canadian Radio-  Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)  requiring "balanced" broadcasting.  "Our fear is we'd be expected to provide balance in aU shows," said Meredith  Woods of 'Women Do This Everyday' and  'The Lesbian Show'.  "And what this might mean is anti-  abortion voices wUl be heard, including  those of R.E.A.L. Women. Furthermore,  some people might complain that lesbianism  isn't a healthy sexuahty and so we might be  required to give homophobic programmers  air time."  Women's programming has already received a scathing letter from an anti-  abortion group, she said.  The 'balance' requirements are based on  a clause in the Broadcasting Act which  states "the programming provided by the  Canadian broadcasting system should provide reasonable, balanced opportunity for  the expression of differing views on matters  of public concern."  Co-op Radio, a volunteer-operated community FM station since 1984, broadcasts  a wide variety of public affairs, music, arts  and ethnic language programs.  "We don't want to teU people what to say,  as the CRTC seems to require," says station spokesperson Peter Royce. "As long as  programmers avoid racist, sexist, or other  abusive comment, and maintain reasonable  standards of quality we don't beheve we  should interfere in the community's use of  this medium.  "The station provides a democratic forum for concerned members of the community to present their own views and perspectives on topics the mainstream media  ignore. This is what the CRTC has licensed  community radio to do."  Co-op Radio has lodged a motion in the  Federal Court of Appeals seeking to overturn the CRTC decision.  KINESIS Across Canada  JoAnn Loulan  Lesbian dolphins and sex and laughter  during which "you'U suck anything." She  captures perfectly the flavour of those first  magic weeks and months when the jaws of  hfe couldn't pry your smoking bodies apart.  Eventually we do come up for air and the  LIP gives way to the MIP, the Moving In  Phenomenon.  Loulan's survey found that frequency of  sexual activity dwindles dramatically by the  third year of lesbian relationships. She believes we've made an unconscious contract  with straight society—with the church, our  parents, the feminist movement—that we  wUl stop doing what is uniquely lesbian. We  wUl stop having lesbian sex, which is the  very source of our power.  "We've made a deal that we won't really  be lesbians. We won't do the goosh qf it.  The lesbian, archetypal goosh."  While the schrapnel of exploding sexual  myths whizzed overhead (lesbians don't get  AIDS, we oidy have "angel sex"), Loulan  delved into the roles we assume in our relationships. The Trans-Am and the Virgin  Mary—a yes/no dynamic that suffocates  our sexual fire. Or Butch and Femme, a  powerful lesbian sexual archetype which she  beheves we closeted too willingly in trade  for acceptance in the feminist movement.  by Lorraine Chisholm  JoAnn Loulan claims to have talked to  over 50,000 lesbians about lesbianism and  sex. She has a therapy practice in Palo Alto,  California and gives workshops on lesbian  sex and self-esteem aU over the continent.  Loulan is the author of Lesbian Sex and  Lesbian Passion: Loving Ourselves and  Each Other, which includes results of a  survey of the sexual practices of 1566 lesbians from questionnaires distributed at her  lectures and workshops.  On November 19th, Loulan entertained a  packed auditorium in Vancouver. She captured her audience with an hUarious, informative and provocative stand-up therapy  routine.  "We leave our hearts in the drawer, on the  counter ... We go through the day being  loveless freaks whUe Ethel at the office relates the juicy details of her romance with  some new guy."  In her next scene Loulan, the famous lesbian sex therapist, has just been invited to  appear on the Oprah Winfrey show. She arrives at the bus stop where several mothers  of her six-year old son's classmates are discussing their hves. "Oh JoAnn, what's new  with you?" She tells them about the show.  "Oh! fabulous, you're kidding ... What are  you going to talk about?"  "WeU I don't know if I've told you but  I'm a lesbian and it's going to be about lesbians."  Those first magic.months when the jaws  of life couldn't pry your smoking bodies apart  Loulan plunged directly into one of her  main themes of the evening—homophobia.  Not the external variety (a kind every les- ■  bian knows about), but the insidious effects  of years of:  Your parents forgetting the name of your  lover of five years ("Laura ... Lisa ... no  wait, let me get it ... Le-Lo-oooLucy!"),  or "Your friend's nice dear ... but does  she have to come to your sister's wedding?"  ("No, she can stay in the car.")  On stage, Loulan mimes a knife carving  her heart out. "Every morning we get out of  bed and perform a httle psychic surgery..."  She tosses the extricated organ into mid-air.  She turns to the audience. "I don't know  if I've told you. Who are we kidding? In  every lesbian's head is this big Rollodex:  They know, they don't know, I've told her,  they know my lover, I haven't told him, they  invited my lover over for dinner ..."

She  moves deftly between humour and seriousness: from acknowledging our sisters in the  animal world (life-long lesbian dolphins) to  acknowledging the pain of incest survivors  amongst us (38 percent of the women she  surveyed were sexuaUy abused under the  age of 18); from the evolution of the Lesbian  Archetypal Hand (... and they told us the  thumb rotated so we could grab food) to the  body-hatred we inherit in this culture.  What I really loved about this evening  was that it was about breaking down barriers: the barriers of sUence around sex,  of judgment, of self-judgment. Amidst my  heartfelt and cathartic laughter I was moved  by the things Loulan had to say, by her original insights and perceptions.  She ended with a challenge. As lesbians  we need to claim our able-bodyism, our  racism and classism, and to claim our homophobia, that httle voice deep inside that  says, "I'm a lesbian, what a bummer!" By  looking fearlessly at them, we diminish their  power and clear the debris to aUow new pos-  sibUities in our sexual relations.  She urges us to commit "premeditated  sex," to unleash our erotic imaginations on  our sex hves and to be lesbians with passion.  Trades and technology:  a school of our own  by Jacqueline Frewin  The Canadian Conference of Women in  Trades and Technology held in October at  Naramata was exceUent. [See facing page.]  Women's energy was clear and strong. My  overaU sense was that we have 'come of age'  and are moving quickly and strongly into  change ... that the foundation has been  buUt underground, almost sUently and now  it is time to step into site and begin the  framing.  One of the very important specifics that  came out of the workshop on "Women and  Vision and Power" was the desire to form  a national Women's School of Trades and  Technology. It excites me simply to write  the name.  We want a school that is administered  by women, taught by women, for women.  This wUl provide support and exceUence to  aUow us to do our work productively and  creatively. It was obvious from this confer  ence we have a broad base of highly skiUed  women. We must pass that strength and  knowledge on to our sisters without having  to deal with the obstructionist pohcies we  have so often been subject to in the past,  Many of us have worked in isolation, with  no support and no female role models.

The Mowing is an outline of some of the  things we wish to provide in the school:  • opportunity for trades and technology  women to teach and share the wealth of  their acquired knowledge  • facilitate the removal of sexism and oppression toward women in trades and  technology  • provide a creative environment in which  the learning/working needs of instructors, students and administrators are  complementary, and pohcies are oriented  Please see School page 9  KINESIS  Lori Longstaff—Tilesetter, and  Heather Watt—Boilermaker  Dec/Jan. 89 Across Canada  Women in trades  Who we are, how far we've come  by Marcia Braundy  Kate Braid—journeywoman union carpenter, contractor, writer, buUder of high-  rises and bridges, founding member of  Vancouver Women in Trades—was the  opening keynote speaker at "Surviving  and Thriving"—a Canadian Conference on  Women in Trades and Technology in Naramata, B.C., October 1-4,1988.  The first two days of this national conference included women from every province  territory excepting Prince Edward Island. These women were an appreciative audience for Braid who began by describing  her findings from a cross-country survey of  tradeswomen and technologists about their  working hves. Braid gave us a sense of ourselves.  "Most of us have been secretaries, waitresses, dental assistants, clerks and certainly mothers, before we got fed up with  the work or the poor wages," Braid said.  Then she reminded us of our strengths.  The women I met are also remarkable  for tremendous perseverance. CaU it endurance, call it stubbornness, call it hard  to handle, (sometimes I used to wonder if I  should call it just plain stupid).  "But we don't give up ... with no encouragement and often outright discouragement, we have managed to find out the secrets of when trades training courses are  happening, how to get ourselves into those  classes, and then how to get hired.  "We persevered. In spite of being the only  woman and intensely conspicuous on the  job, in spite of getting less training than the  men on the job, in spite of employers who  said, "women aren't motivated," "women  won't last" (and who then did their best to  make sure their own predictions came true),  in spite of fellow workers who said, "women  aren't strong enough," and "this is man's  work," and "women are only here for sexual partners" and then harassed us after we  said no ...  "In spite of aU this we kept going ... We  reUsh a good challenge."  Braid told us we had courage. "Remember your first job ... do you appreciate how  much courage it took to walk onto that site,  to approach the foreman, to start work with  your very first partner?  "Not only did we show courage then, but  we kept going when nobody had been there  ahead of us or could tell us the rules or how  to handle new situations. We made up the  rules. We kept going."  She confirmed what we had learned.  "About sexual harassment, we learned the  hard way that it's no good to be a nice girl  and cast our eyes down, that we have to look  the creeps and the jerks in the eye and talk  back. We have learned that it doesn't matter if you talk softly or you talk loud. But  you talk..  'We learned to laugh. To get used to the  way the guys got along, joking, everything  hght and easy.  "But also when things were tense ... to  make a joke, to keep going. You can say anything you want to them, as long as you have  a smUe on your face."  The Workplace Culture  "We learned that when we worked with  other women, it was different." We could  'be a carpenter,' and stiU, in the evenings,  work out our emotional difficulties and "feel  the satisfaction of that accomplishment as  weU."  Braid reminded us that "some of us also  learned it wasn't worth it. The personal  cost was too high or there was not enough  support, and they stopped. Those women  are our foremothers too. Every one of them  helped break ground, and we thank them."  Do you  appreciate how  much courage  it took...?  As weU, she said, "We learned that making good money makes you feel good."  And ultimately, " ... of course, we  learned our trade. Most of us learned skiUs  at which we eventually became very good,  often from the same men who were also our  greatest obstacle. Men were a contradiction  for us."  Kate Braid told us wonderful stories of  the experiences of the women she had spoken to, and then began to explore what  it aU means. She noted that, although we  were experiencing a bond with many other  women in Uke careers at the conference, it  is clear our absolute numbers remain smaU  across the country.  Many of the reasons for this are already  obvious. Less obvious but equally telUng  are the results, discussed by Braid, of a research study by Elizabeth Ross Kanter with  women in the corporate world who work  with large numbers of men in situations  where men control the culture of the workplace.  Kanter found that as long as women are  in the token position, in a ratio of say 85:15,  then at least three things happen:  • the women are highly conspicuous at  work  • their presence exaggerates men's awareness of what they have in common (with  each other) and  • the women wUl be treated as symbols of  womanhood rather than as individuals.  Drawing clearly the similarities of these  corporate women with the experience of  tradeswomen and technologists, Braid reaffirmed the court judgment in the CN Rail  decision. This decision noted that untU a  School from page 8  towards change and greater economic potential for women  • provide a place for women to network, support and change social views of  women working  • provide role models for other women  • provide the economy with our skUled excellence  • enable women to fiU the skiUed trades  and technologies gap occurring in the job  market  • provide a central bank of trades and technical knowledge as it develops and progresses so it can be made easily accessi  ble to aU women who are teaching, learning and working—often in isolation  • provide an aU-encompassing curriculum  to prepare women for aU aspects of the  workplace environment.  As you can see, we are on our way. We  wUl keep you informed about our progress.  We also need money to cover current expenses. A bank account has been opened  with the money coUected at the conference.

Kate Braid  critical mass of women existed in aU segments of the work force, women would continue to be viewed and treated as other.  Braid noted that, rather than taking the  discrimination personaUy, "it is a structural  problem brought about by our token numbers."  Women in these fields face a number  of double binds, especially women ...  in trades and technologies [who] become  physically strong, competent, mechanically  skiUed and confident. These are not considered feminine qualities in this culture and  yet they are the qualities that make us successful in our chosen work.  "As long as this society defines women  as feminine and feminine as soft and passive and physicaUy weak, we wUl be 'non-  traditional,' unacceptable and often uncomfortable on the construction site and in the  shop."  Serious Lobbying Issues  Throughout her presentation, Braid showed  us who we are and how far we have come—  and how successfuUy. We saw that not only  are we machinists, mechanics, ironworkers, electronics technicians and marine engineers, but we are smaU businesswomen  as weU, and foremen (sic), safety inspectors, apprenticeship counsellors and industrial arts and vocational instructors.  When Braid asked women across the  country "to name their chief sources of support, most of them named two groups: one  was each other—individuaUy and in women  in trades organizations; the other was their  union.  "Although women had mixed experiences  with union support, in general trade unions  have been one of the few organizations  [with] the power and the principles to consistently lobby for women's right to do what  we choose, and do it with fair pay and good  working conditions."  As aU is not rosy in this arena, Braid also  laid down a chaUenge: "Women have become presidents of their locals, shop stewards, safety officers and elected officials.  It is a structural  problem brought  on by our  token numbers  "It is now time to raise our concerns  with the union bureaucrats—not just the  working members—and make the concerns  of women in trades and technologies serious lobbying issues for the Canadian trade  union movement."  The most significant aspect of Braid's  keynote address was the sense of accomplishment she gave us. She set the tone for  our work in the rest of the conference.  "Women are stUl, although in smaU numbers, becoming integrated in the trade and  technology workforce," said Braid.  "We are, hke the men before us, getting  skiUs and tickets and being promoted, becoming in our turn, teachers of those sHUs.  "We have met the challenge."

The second year I called the column  Beans, and explained that beans were a  cheap source of nutrition accessible to everyone and besides, when I was growing up,  my family said I was "fuU of beans."  This column marks the end of my third  year and I have to tell you, it's time for me  to caU it quits 'cause I am no longer fuU of  beans.

I met a fiery pensioner who  came storming out of a polling place and  put the whole election in perspective.  "Phooey," she said. I love meeting and  talking to women.  The problem is, it takes time. You have  to get out there and meet people and talk to  them. You have to think about what they're  telling you, how it's sirmlar, how it's different to other things you've heard or read. In  the faU I began to feel I was having to reach  to find topics to write about each month—  not necessarUy a bad thing. But I began to  feel that, whUe the stories may be different,  my perspective was the same.  I felt it was time for me to shift my perspective and deepen it. This takes time.  So I started thinking. This not only cuts  down on the amount of time you have to go  out and meet and talk to people, it increases  the amount of time it takes you to make  a story out of what they tell you because  you're not sure of what you think about it  any more.  This is aU very interesting, but the Kinesis deadline rolls around regularly ten  months out of every year. What it aU bods  down to is, I can't do it right now.

It's also kept me prodi  ing writing regularly for three years. I don't  write tons and it's a worry to me, so having  the column was reassuring.  But the fact is, I have stopped writing for  this column, so I bloody weU better say so  and get on with it.  Thanks to Kinesis for asking me to do  this.

The Broadcast Media Ban, announced  October 19th, prohibits TV and radio interviews with so-caUed militant groups in  the six counties of Northern Ireland. This  across-Britain ban covers members and supporters of Sinn Fein—the pohtical party of  the Republican Movement—the Irish Republican Army, and nine other groups active in the six counties.  Some of these groups are Loyalist paramilitaries but, as Thatcher herself stated,  the ban is aimed directly at the Republican  Movement and their supporters in Ireland  and Britain.  By imposing the ban, the British government is directly censoring a legal pohtical party. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams,  an elected member of the British Parliament, said the ban is "an obvious attempt  to censor the right of Sinn Fein, which  has an electoral mandate, and the rights  of tens of thousands of Sinn Fein voters to  hold and express a pohtical opinion. Sinn  Fein's views are unacceptable to the British government, and because we reject British claims of sovereignty over the six counties and articulate the demand for national  self-determination, we are being censored."  Sinn Fein member Dodie McGuiness, an  elected municipal counciUor in Derry, expressed fears of the effects of this ban. Many  of her concerns were in the areas of social housing, welfare and community needs.  McGuiness wUl now be censored from the  local media when she raises these issues in  councU meetings.  British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd  justified the ban by stating that TV appearances by certain pohtical activists "have  caused widespread offence to viewers and  listeners throughout the United Kingdom."  The new legislation has not escaped the  notice of South Africa's P.W. Botha, who  warned media in his country to "smother  the propaganda of those who commit violence" or else he would impose measures  simUar to Britain's.  Shortly after the media ban was announced, the Tories introduced more repressive legislation, this time abolishing the  rights of suspects in the six counties to remain sUent under pohce interrogation.  This measure is expected to become law  by January, ending a centuries-old pUlar of  the British justice system. The British government plans to introduce simUar restrictions in England and Wales.  Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King  stated that, under the new law, a judge  wUl be able to draw from a suspect's silence "whatever inferences appear proper."  In other words, silence can now be interpreted as guilt.  The British Labour Party has attacked  the legislation saying the right to sUence  is an "essential element of a free society." In Canada, the right to remain sUent  when questioned by pohce is constitution-  aUy guaranteed.  As one Sinn Fein counciUor remarked,  "One day they ban us from speaking, and  the next day they remove our right to silence. There certainly is a sick irony there."  Finally, another extraordinary power was  put on the Statute Book in the six counties in October. Under general criminal law,  pohce officers now have the power to take  mouth swabs for DNA profiling (genetic fingerprinting) from suspects by force. This  power, hke many of the "special powers" in  the six counties, does not apply anywhere  else in Britain.  The only reason given to Parhament to  justify the departure for Northern Ireland  was by John Stanley MP, who said "in  Northern Ireland ... increasingly among  ... serious non-terrorist criminals, there is  The Malaysian consulate in Vancouver felt some heat on October 31 when concerned Canadians and Americans protested the rapid destruction of the Borneo  rainforest by logging interests.

The validity of this statement is questionable in hght of the Chief Constable's  1987 report which showed a decrease in serious crimes of six percent.  The British military occupation of the six  county statelet of Northern Ireland is now  in its 20th year. The Thatcher government  is further away from a peaceful solution  than ever. The British public is becoming  increasingly aware the only solution to Ireland's "Britain Problem" is a complete pohtical and military withdrawal.

V5K 4W6  African women reach  out to one another  by Hannah Edemikpong  In the agrarian economy of Africa,  polygamy ensures the accumulation of great  wealth because husbands are assured of free  labour which neither complains nor rebels  against exploitation. In this way, the woman  offers her owner benefits beyond those of  slave. She is a source of pleasure and above  aU, she produces other workers and thus  new sources of wealth.  The products of these workers (young  girls) are sold into permanent servitude under the guise of customary marriage. The  girl's consent is never sought, nor does their  father appreciate the consequences of such  transaction.  Hauwa Abubakar, an 8-year old viUage  girl from predominantly Mushm northern  Nigeria, was forced in 1983 to marry a cattleman old enough to be her grandfather. In  June 1987, when Hauwa turned 12 and began menstruating, her father forced her to  move in with her husband.  She refused to have sex with him and ran  home twice. Both times, her father (who  owed dowry to the cattleman) forced hey  back. When she tried to run away again, the  cattleman chopped off her legs and genitals  with an axe and Hauwa Abubakar died.  One African proverb says, "The hen has  the vagina and the head which the cock  grasp whUe sexing it." Women's only legitimate purpose in hfe as designated by  African men is to bear chUdren. They bear  the Ml weight of a man during intercourse,  yet their life-giving canals and central organ  of sensory pleasure are mutilated by circumcision, excision and infibulation.  Child-bearing thus becomes a harrowing  ordeal of suffering which often costs them  their hves.  Many rural African women have abnormalities hke ragged scars, keloid formation,  cysts, pelvic inflammation, uterine prolapse  and chronic cervicitis, as a result of these  practices. Indeed, the practice is aimed at  making men maintain their superiority over  women. Said Inyang Edward, a traditional  ruler of Ugep in Nigeria, "Since the clitoris  is an aggressive sexual organ of a woman, a  non-excision of it wUl make a woman stubborn and hard to control. The operation is  necessary for each male to control the sexuality of each female."  In parts of Mali and Mauritania in west  Africa, a man's importance is measured by  the waistline of his wife, so he tries to increase it by literahy force-feeding or fattening her.  A few years ago, a man appeared in  court in Goa, Mali accused of having kUled  his wife by suffocation whUe force-feeding  her. Undoubtedly grieved by the loss of his  wife, the man denied the charge, claiming  Please see Nigeria page 12  KINESIS S»8®S§\  INTERNATIONAL  by Maureen Eason  Palestinians  Calling the American bluff  Since the uprising began in Gaza and the  West Bank on December 9,1987, more than  314 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been  kUled. Thousands of Palestinian women,  men and chUdren remain injured from bullet wounds, beatings or both, and many  thousands are imprisoned without trial. Deportations and house demolitions (coUective  punishment) continue.  According to Monthly Review, in the  first nine months of the uprising alone when  221 people were kUled, "relative to the  size of the population, this is equivalent to  38,800 hi the United States, or 82 percent  of the number of Americans kUled in battle during the almost nine years of the Viet  Nam war ... As of the end of June, it is  estimated that there were more than 6,000  West Bank and Gaza Palestinians held in  detention. Proportionately this is as if a  million protesters had been placed in U.S.  prison camps."  Out of recognition to the people of the  intifada (uprising) and their demands,  the Palestine National CouncU (PNC) announced in Algiers on November 15, 1988  the declaration of an independent Palestinian state. Together with the declaration,  the PNC accepted UN Resolutions 242 and  and renounced the use of terrorism,  thereby fulfilling U.S. conditions for the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to  enter Middle East peace talks.  Acceptance of UN Resolution 242 is a  major step for the PNC as it does not mention the Palestinians by name, but only as  Nigeria from page 11  he had sacrificed her to a tradition going  back to the mists of time, only in order to  increase her beauty. Besides death, force-  feeding contributes to high blood pressure  and diabetes.  The hst of these practices and oppression of African women would be endless if  time and space permitted. Even now, as we  approach the 21st century when enormous  progress made in aU fields of human activity has debunked many former beliefs, the  African woman is stiU the victim of undesirable practices.  This is why we have launched a campaign  against female genital mutilation and other  acts. It is a sustained campaign to show traditionalists the undesirable consequences of  the practices they foUow.  We are unanimous in recognizing the  fight is ours, and do not accept campaigning methods imposed upon us from outside:  this is why most campaigns conducted from  abroad have been counterproductive.  Our methods include house-to-house  campaigning in which every home in the  community is visited and the residents are  addressed on the evils of these practices.  Also, we conduct countryside "enlightenment tours" where our field workers speak  to rural women in markets, roadsides and  anywhere they are seen. Campaigning is  also done by radio, television and newspaper advertisements, and distribution of  print materials.  As a self-supporting women's voluntary  organization, lack of funds for our rural  women's program is our greatest problem. We earnestly appeal to our womenfolk, and feminists and feminist groups to  help extend this campaign so that millions  of our rural women can benefit. We wUl  accept and acknowledge aU donations no  matter how smaU.

Africa  refugees. It guarantees "the ... pohtical independence of every state in the area ..."  Since Israel is one of those states, recognition is implicit.  But whUe 54 countries have already recognized the new state of Palestine, the  U.S. response to the initiative has thus far  ranged from negative to lukewarm. Even  though the Palestinians must accept resolutions 242 and 338 before the U.S. wUl accept the PLO into Middle East peace talks,  the U.S. still does not accept the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-  determination, which was granted them in  the 1947 UN Resolution to divide Palestine  into a Jewish state and an Arab state.  As George Bush said in a September  speech, "I have made very clear that I am  opposed to an independent Palestinian state  for a simple reason. Such a state would be a  threat to the security of Israel and of Jordan  ... And ... it would also be contrary to  America's interests. The creation of a Palestinian state would not lead to peace."  MeanwhUe, the U.S. charade goes on. Acceptance of 242 and 338 is "encouraging"  but "ambiguous;" implicit recognition of Israel is not enough; explicit is the only thing  that counts.  What the Palestinians have reaUy done  by meeting U.S. criteria for entering peace  talks is caU the U.S. bluff. If the U.S. is  serious about peace in the Middle East,;  pressure must be placed on Israel. Why is  Israel never asked to recognize the Palestinian right to self-determination? What  happened to a phrase caUed "mutual recognition?" Why is Israel never expected to  renounce terrorism? Or isn't 22 bombing  raids on Lebanon this year alone considered  terrorism—not to mention the atrocities in  the West Bank and Gaza  Honduran babies at risk  by Donna Butorac  A magistrate at the appeal court in San  Pedro Sula, Honduras, Daysi Rodriguez,  has called for a detaUed investigation into  aUegations that Honduran babies are being  sold for their organs to be used in transplant surgery.  In August of this year the newspaper El  Pais published details of a simUar traffic  in chUdren in BrazU, whereby babies are  sold on the international market by organizations set up specificaUy for this purpose.  According to El Pais, in state-run maternity hospitals, babies are kidnapped at  birth—presumably with the collusion of  hospital staff—and their mothers subsequently informed that their chUd has died.  A substitute body is buried and the real  chUd sold to foreign families, at prices ranging from $5,000 (US) to $20,000.  The main importers of BrazUian chUdren  are said to be from the United States, Israel, Western Europe and Canada.  The caU for an investigation into such  practices in Honduras apparently foUows  recent aUegations in the European Parliament.  A previous investigation was carried out  in 1987, but its findings were never published, according to Rodriguez.  At that time, the then-general secretary  of the Honduran national Social Welfare  Board, Leonardo VUleda Bermiidez, testified that chUdren who had been adopted by  foreign families had subsequently had their  organs sold for transplants. "Many couples  came to adopt chUdren with physical handicaps ... we found out that they could seU  pieces of them," said ViUeda Bermiidez.  The European Parhament has recently  asked its member countries to investigate  the possibility of European connections  with the so-called Honduran "fattening-up  houses," where babies are kept before being sold abroad. It aUeges that corpses of  babies which were missing some of their organs have been found in these houses.  After the coastal city of Bluefields, Nicaragua was destroyed by a hurricane in  October, Canadian relief agencies sprang into action. The same, unfortunately,  could not be said of the Canadian government. Despite the heavy loss of lives  and serious damage to homes and crops, Ottawa has had a remarkably sluggish  response to the Nicaraguan people. Non-government aid workers believe this lack  of generosity is based, at least partly, on Ottawa's relations with the U.S., which  has a trade embargo on Nicaragua.  Canadians are being asked to pressure their government to increase its aid to  Nicaragua. And, again this year, Tools For Peace is busy collecting notebooks,  rubber boots, farm tools, safety gear and roofing materials to send directly to the  Nicaraguans.

After all, everybody loves the environment.  And every politician appears keen to study the mess, and regulate the mess,  and dispose of the mess, and clean up the mess—and maybe even preserve little bits  so they don't get too messy.  The environment is, after all, a mess.  Not everybody sees it that way. There is a real mess, true. But in this other view,  the mess is the economic system that creates poisonous, unsustainable products  and processes. And it is also, inextricably, the political structures that vest  power in the poisoners, and stifle the sensible—and intuitive—voices of people.  Feminists have long been involved in movements to push government to at least  clean up and preserve. We have also thought hard about what causes the waste and  damage and loss. Not merely in technical terms, but in terms of the dominant culture's  assumptions about power, wealth and ownership—and what it is to be human.  On the following pages, Kinesis presents some of that thinking, and some hard facts  about what's going on and what's being done.  Ecofeminism:  Embracing the earth  by Shelley Anderson  Patriarchal oppression of women is integral to the oppression of the earth, and the  earth is dying at the hands of this patriarchal society.  These two premises form the basis of  ecofeminism.  The term, coined by French scholar Fran-  coise d'Eaubonne in 1974 in her book, La  Feminisme ou la Mori, is used to describe  a movement that is both radical and compassionate. Radical, in that society must be  restructured in a non-patriarchal way, not  just in the sense of human relations, but also  in the sense of human relations with aU the  earth and its diverse species.  Compassionate, in the sense that the saving of the earth must free aU species from  patriarchal oppression.  As the term suggests, ecofeminism has  evolved from the common roots and aspirations of both the feminist and ecology movements. Like both these movements, ecofeminism encompasses diverse groups with diverse approaches.  Because there is no official dogma,  ecofeminism is difficult to define. The meaning of the movement is constantly shifting,  changing, and growing as its adherents learn  and develop.   Ecofeminism is an organic movement.  Common threads include the ideas and  practices of holism, interdependence, non-  hierarchical systems and the consensus  decision-making process.  Holistic ways of thinking and hving are  vitaUy important to ecofeminism. Seeing  the planet as a hving entity, whom some  have renamed Gaia, where each region or  eco-subsystem is mutuaUy dependant on  aU the others, is part of this holism. The  destructive tendency of patriarchal society to divide the earth into resource areas, waiting to be mined, logged, poUuted  or utilized, ignores the facts that toxic  residues from "man-made" chemical poUu-  tants travel throughout the biosphere, that  the destruction of forests seriously threatens the global atmospheric oxygen supply,  and other dangers to hfe on earth.  Ecofeminism teaches that we must break  the patriarchal grasp on the earth and  heal her wounds by recreating our hfestyles  and technologies into ones non-toxic to the  earth. Ecofeminists advocate such alternatives as recycling, selective logging, organic  farming, and bioregionalism.  Neither Above Nor Below  Ecofeminism recognizes the basic interdependence of aU hfe on earth. Western  thought, with its dualism, has long set humans above the rest of the species in the  biosphere.  Deep ecologists, hke David Foreman of  Earth First!, perpetuate this dualistic mode  of thinking when they identify humanity as  the enemy of nature, advocating human extinction.  It is this dualism which has separated  men from women, spirit from flesh, mind  from body, culture from nature—and has  also set one over the other in the western  value system.  ^J Ecofeminists oppose this dualistic mode  "of thought, insisting "that the domination  of women in society precedes the domination of non-human nature and that we must  chaUenge domination within society in order not only to free ourselves but to achieve  our ecological objectives," (Ynestra King,  The Nation).  Humanity is seen as an integral and interdependent part of the earth ecosystem,  neither above nor below other species in importance, merely more able to influence its  environment.  One of the most basic principles of  ecofeminism is the importance of non-  hierarchical systems. From the belief in the  interdependence of aU beings stems the idea  of equal importance of each part of the system.  The use of consensus decision-making ensures that each voice has equal value and  creates an atmosphere of non-competitive  idea buUding. In this way, ecofeminism incorporates the ideals of holism and equahty  into its very structure.  Ecofeminism is a spontaneous grass-roots  movement. It has evolved both from women  seeking to expand their feminism to the hberation of the planet, and from people in  the environmental movements finding themselves frustrated by sexist or racist thinking.  The inclusive nature of ecofeminism allows it to be embraced by animal libera-  tionists, anti-nuclear activists, bioregional-  ists, people involved in goddess spirituality,  etc.  From groups of people taking nonviolent direct action to prevent logging road  construction—some of whom may never  have heard the term 'ecofeminism'—to people hke Ynestra King and Chariene Spret-  nak who are working to create an inteUec-  tual framework for ecofeminist process and  experience, to the Ecofeminist Caucus of  the Green Party of BC, [see pg. 18]—all  are part of the broad ecofeminist movement.  Filling Critical Voids  Ecofeminism fiUs critical voids in both  feminist and ecological thinking. Feminism  tends to neglect environmental issues. And  much feminist thought has de-emphasized  women's biological and historical connections with the earth and life-giving values  in order to promote more sexual equahty in  the workplace.  In the words of B.C. ecofeminist Judith  Plant, "women's values, centered around  hfe giving, must be revalued, elevated from  their once subordinated role" ("Searching for Common Ground: Ecofeminism and  Bioregionalism," The New Catalyst).  Some feminist critics of ecofeminism fear  this may be setting feminism back, seeing  it as a reversion to "maternal feminism" or  "biology as destiny." A closer look shows  that ecofeminists argue that women have  no biological monopoly on natural affinities with the earth, but that these affinities,  whether they are found in women or men,  instead of being reviled as in patriarchy,  ought to be embraced as a means of personalizing our attempt to save the planet.  It is not, perhaps, women's biology that  gives her a deeper insight into the earth or  human social systems, but her disempow-  ered position in this society.  Ecologists often faU to address the issue  of gender. Ecofeminists, however, have discovered the roots of misogyny and the roots  of the hatred of nature are inseparable.  Rightists and fundamentalists have always seen the oppression of women as key  to their ability to exploit the earth: in Nazi  Germany, Khomeini's Iran, Jerry FalweU's  America, etc. The left, environmental movements and ecologists generaUy faU to make  this connection.  Sharon Doubiago says "because of sexism, because of the psychotic avoidance of  the issue at aU costs, ecologists have failed  to grasp the fact that at the core of our  suicidal mission is the psychological issue  of gender, the oldest war, the war of the  sexes." ("Deeper than Deep Ecology: Men  Must Become Feminists," The New Catalyst).  WhUe feminism is often exclusive or  alienating to men, perhaps ecofeminism has  opened a window to understanding and participation for them. Ecologists must expand  their beliefs to include feminism.  We, as women, must expand our feminism to embrace the earth.  KINESIS  Dec/Jan. 89 Forests Forsaken  Instilled from the cradle  by Judith Quinlan  Every day I drive 30 mUes to work, over  a small mountain and through some of the  most beautiful old growth forest on Vancouver Island. This stand is a tiny park  maintained by MacMUlan Bloedel. It is full  of giant cedars, scraggly with moss, that  loom on either side of the road hke the pU-  lars of an ancient temple.  AU around this grove the forest is being clearcut. As I drive down the eastern  side of "the hump" my eyes are assaulted  by the mutilated face of another mountain,  its banks scored by erosion and mudshdes,  its once majestic forests now a scattering of  dead trunks hke a game of pick-up sticks being played by a giant.  The forest companies would have us beheve they are managing these clearcuts, replanting them for future harvesting.  But we know that less than 20 percent of  the Island's clearcuts have been replanted.  We know that only 40-50 percent of the  seedlings they plant ever hve to maturity.  And we know, now, that areas that were replanted 15 years ago are dying back from  lack of nutrients.  Selective logging provides the answers to  these problems. Of course it wouldn't provide the forest companies with the miUion-  doUars-a-day profit they now enjoy.  But selective logging is labour-intensive  forestry, and would provide more jobs than  clear cutting. And it would mean that our  forests are preserved for jobs in future generations. And for habitat for the animals  that depend on them. And for human beings  who hke to visit the forests because here we  can enjoy a peaceful reminder of how we  were meant to be.  The great forests of the earth are being  destroyed, and with them the source of oxygen that aU hfe depends on. We know that  selective logging is a simple and immediate  solution and that clearcut logging must be  stopped.  But is this a feminist issue?  As women, are we to confine our struggles to the issues that pohticians define as  women's issues? To issues that improve our  immediate hves marginally, whUe maintaining the status quo? I beheve that environmental issues, hke clearcut logging, are very  The countryside is no longer a place  to escape the political struggles of the city.  H the forest companies are really managing this natural resource so weU, then why  are they always needing to move into new  areas? Like the Carmanah grove, where the  largest Sitka spruce in Canada grow. Like  the Stein Valley, the last unlogged watershed in B.C., and spiritual home to the Lytton and Mt. Currie Indian Bands. Like the  last remaining virgin forests of Clayoquot  Sound.  Like the Seven Sisters area, a proposed  provincial park and part of the Gitksan  and Wet'suwet'en Tribes' hind claim. Like  the watersheds of the Slocan Valley, where  aU the surrounding countryside has already been logged. Like the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Nass VaUey, the ChUcotin  Plateau, the Stikine River.  The list goes on and on.  Clearcut logging is not a sustainable  method of sUviculture. After clearing and  burning an area, it is susceptible to erosion; valuable land is washed away to  clog streams that once spawned salmon.  The land is depleted, and newly planted  seedlings have httle chance of survival.  For a forest to be healthy, it must evolve  through several stages. After a natural forest fire, scrub bushes and grasses take over,  binding the earth and preventing erosion.  This bushland provides a habitat for animals and birds that bring new seeds to the  area and fertilize it with their droppings.  In time the poplar trees take over. These  are useless weeds to the forest industry,  but essential to the forest because they  are nitrogen-fixers, preparing the land for  nitrogen-hungry evergreens and shading the  forest floor so young spruce and fir trees can  flourish. Eventually the evergreens dominate, and a mature forest develops.  New Forests Need Old Forests  The forest is an ecosystem of plant and animal life, interdependent, each essential to  the health of the other. The new forest requires the existence of old-growth forests  nearby to provide seeds and animal hfe for  its development. And we require the old-  growth forests, because they are a hving  laboratory and a source of genotypes just in  case we need them after our simplistic silviculture fads.  much feminist issues. We are, after aU, the  mothers of the world. And the earth is our  grandmother.  The Rape Of Us All  What is being done to the earth by the  power-brokers of patriarchy is being done to  every individual woman on it.  The rape of our grandmother is the rape  of us aU. The mentality that aUows a few  companies to exploit the earth for profit  is the same mentality that gave us the  pornography industry, the cosmetics industry, the advertising industry. The mentality  that sees the wUderness as a place without  worth—or worse—a dangerous place, is the  same mentality that sees women as worthless or threatening.  Nature is, after all, female. The mentality that views wUd creatures as "game"  and makes sport of their murder, is the  same mentality that aUows urban hunters  to prowl the streets in search of "taU." The  mentality that tries to take shortcuts with  nature and her cycles, is the same mentality  that denies women's wisdom, that meddles  with our reproductive processes, that tries  to tame and control us. L-^s^ft  The boys try to "manage" the forests the  same way they would manage their women.  As feminists we can no more afford to allow this desecration of nature than we can  aUow the desecration of our own natures.  Environmental issues are, at the core, feminist issues. Not aU male environmentalists  realize this yet. That doesn't matter, because the women know.  Women in the environmental movement  are already making these links. Witness the  New Catalyst issue on ecofeminism (Issue  #10), which is possibly one of the most powerful feminist documents to emerge from  this province in recent years. The time has  come for feminists to move beyond our isolation and make personal and organizational  links with environmental groups.  The countryside is no longer a place to escape the pohtical struggles of the city, but is  increasingly becoming a place where women  are engaged in far-reaching feminist struggles, making connections between our exploitation as women and the exploitation of  the earth that sustains us aU.  Is this a feminist issue?  by Ivy Scott  An old forest at risk  by Shelley Anderson  During the week of Nov. 14-18 hi Nanaimo, eight people were tried and found guUty of  criminal contempt of court. They had disobeyed a court order demanding they desist obstructing road buUding at Sulphur Passage in Clayoquot Sound.  The summer of '88 at Sulphur Passage was the scene of much tension as environmental 'protectors' carried on non-violent actions to prevent the construction of a road which  would open the way to clearcutting of the last pristine inlet/watershed containing old  growth forest on Vancouver Island.  The Friends of Clayoquot Sound, a non-profit, community-organized public interest  group, with fuU support of the Tofino Chamber of Commerce, had requested a moratorium  on road budding in the area untU B.C. Forest Products (now Fletcher ChaUenge) came  up with a sustainable development plan. In a June meeting with the community, BCFP  refused the moratorium.  The Friends had based their request on the aUegation that the forest company's logging  plans for the area had been inadequately publicized to aUow the people of Tofino to respond. Plans were advertised in the local newspaper of Port Alberni, a town some two hours  drive from Tofino, the region most affected by the proposed logging of Sulphur Passage.  The environmental interests of the Tofino area were strengthened in the recent municipal election where Friends director Maureen Frazer and two other Friends were elected to  council. Also, the Tofino Chamber of Commerce recently completed a sustainable development plan for tourism, the first of its kind.  As of the beginning of September, Fletcher ChaUenge has stopped road construction at  Sulphur Passage, due to the contentious nature of the issue. It is, however, not the only region of Clayoquot Sound where environmentaUy unsafe logging practices are being carried  out. For the Friends of Clayoquot Sound, and many other citizens of Tofino, the struggle  continues.  You can support them by calling or writing the ministers responsible for Tourism, Environment, Forests, etc., and expressing your concern over the need for changed logging  practices and sustainable development plans, or send donations to Friends of Clayoquot  Sound, Box 489, Tofino, B.C. VOR 2Z0.  Lavina Lightbown has been part of the  Indian struggle her entire hfe. She is on the  CouncU of the Haida Nation, and is its past  president.  Ivy: White culture often talks about  environmental issues as though they're  separate from other political and economic questions. How does B. C. Native  culture differ in its perception of peoples' relationship to the natural world?  Lavina: Perhaps that's the thing that re-  aUy struck me when I first went off into  society, was the separations. In Indian culture it's a whole, there's no separations. You  know, between men or women or chUdren,  or anything else.  In regards to the land and the environment we have a different concept altogether. We don't become environmentally  conscious after we're grown up, that's something that's instiUed in us from the cradle.  It's part of your hfe, we're made to know  that aU things of nature have their purpose  no matter how minute it is.  So they have this legend: the frog as  minute as it is has its purpose so they  weren't to destroy it. One of the ways of  teaching chUdren was through legend. It was  said that when the hunters used to go out,  the first thing that was taught to them was  to keep the fires going, as we had no matches  and things. ■... .^^^x v'"  And on the first day these two Uttle boys  went out, that was their job and the hunters  went out and of course the boys ... threw  frogs in the fire, and that's against everything we're taught as chUdren. And it says  that there was a volcanic eruption and the  boys were lost in that volcano.  And that was the way they used to teach  the young that we're not supposed to destroy anything of nature.  I think the environmental question in  Canada is one that should have been a real  issue before this election, and yet it wasn't.  It was shoved aside by the free trade issue.  But if free trade does go through, we reaUy  have some concerns here in Canada.  A few months ago when I was in Ottawa at an environmental meeting, I got  ahold of a document that was signed by the  Bureau of Indian Affairs in the States and  the Department of Indian Affairs of Canada  stating that they're going to bring ah the  garbage and waste from the States and from  Canada on to Indian land in Canada. That's  because they stUl don't regard our homelands as ours, they regard it as federal land  so they think they can do whatever they hke  on these lands.  I asked the Minister [of the Environment]  then at that meeting what was the purpose  of that decision. Was it to get rid of two  problems?  There were a couple of people at that  meeting who made statements that said,  how do we know that when the Indians have  control of the land, they won't log it. I think  aU you have to do is look at the history of  the people in the system and our people,  that should teU for itself that we're conservationists.  We had to be conservationists because we  don't intend to move from country to country. This is our homelands and we have to  conserve in order for it to sustain us. As it's  sustained us, we must sustain it. Like the  salmon has sustained us. I think we have an  obligation and a responsibility to clean up  the habitat of the salmon. In some areas it's  almost completely wiped out.  Ivy: In the Stein Declaration, the Mt.  Currie and Lytton bands restated the  responsibility they feel as caretakers of  the land around the Stein. I wanted to  compare that to the push by some people in the environmental movement to  have land where there is Native claim  turned into park land, which would pre  sumably stay under federal jurisdiction.  Those environmentalists see this as the  solution to logging.  Lavina: That was one of the reasons that  I went to the environmental meeting in Ottawa. I wanted to make them understand  the reasons why, in South Moresby, our people don't want to ? ^ree to a national park. I  think the reason that wasn't said out clearly  was because there was so much support  from all over the world [against logging].  But the ones supporting from aU over the  world were talking national park. That was  the thrust of the environmental group and  of government, not the thrust of the Haida  people. We want to protect that area. A protected wUderness area under the jurisdiction of the Haida Nation was what I heard  our people saying. And I understand the  language completely.  The other [reason for going to the meeting] was to make environmental people  within your society understand our reasons  for it. It was difficult for most of them because a lot of environmentalists push for it  because they see themselves in an ideal job  aU their hves managing a park.  And I don't blame them for thinking that  but I think they must realize that because  government is locked in to an elective system, you never know what government is  going to be in and you never know what  kind of people are going to be within the  government.  Only if it's in our jurisdiction under the  land claims area wUl it be protected.  The people who came here weren't the indigenous people and they don't give a darn  what they do to the land because they can  go back to their roots, and we'd be left with  the devastation. Same as the Indians in 1860  were saying to them when they found there  was gold in the Black hills.  The government wanted the* Indians off  that land because they wanted it. And the  Indians said we don't understand you. You  said you want our lands and once you get it  you desecrate the whole area, then we have  to hve with it. WeU, it's stiU going on today.  The desecration of our land is something  that's really hard on our people. I just met  one woman the other day, and every tune I  meet one of the elders from home, especially  the women, they talk about the logging  that's going on up there. They've just got  barren bills all over the place, just stumps.  And it reaUy hurts them, that's the first  thing I always hear from them when I see  them. They're stiU taking aU our logs out  by the barge load, so many loads a week.  How long can that go on? They've been doing that for years now. They intend to give  us empty lands, and then they'd say we're  welfare people.  The salmon habitat is being graduaUy destroyed, same as they destroyed the buffalo  on the plains, and they think that the Indian problem wUl be finished if they destroy  the salmon because its been the backbone  of our culture. But we're survivors. Even if  they destroy the salmon, we'd stUl survive.  In Indian culture, man and nature are  one. One doesn't try to overcome the other,  and that's a real important difference. Land  is very sacred to Indian people. The Haidas  have a responsibility toward the sea because  that's our hfehne out there on that island.  So we need to protect the sea; we have a lot  of sea foods that come out of there.  I think our phUosophy of sharing, which  lost us the control of our lands, our resources, and our hves, and which stiU remains our strongest phUosophy in spite of  everything that's been done to us, stiU exists.  What we've said is that we want to keep  our seas healthy so that we can share with  the rest of the world aU the food that comes  out of that area. A lot of food comes out of  that area.  AINESIS  KINESIS by Paula Rubinson  WMMGIrT  Zero waste is the ideal  The toxic waste story in B.C. began with  the colonialists, but 1982 is a significant  date in recent history. That year, two recommendations were made to the provincial  government by its Hazardous Waste Management Advisory Committee. The committee proposed that adequate public consultation and participation processes be initiated in order to make an acceptable decision about waste management, and that a  crown corporation be set up to implement  this decision.  Needless to say, the provincial government did neither.  In 1982, the Ministry of Environment  turned the problem over to the private sector, announcing that Genstar/IT would operate a toxic waste dump at McLean Lake  on the traditional territory of the Bonaparte  people.  By 1984, Genstar/IT withdrew their  proposal, pleading economic unfeasibihty.  Their retreat was reaUy due to public outcry  over the company and the lack of provincial  toxics regulations—and outcry over possible  health and environmental effects.  The Special Waste Advisory Committee  (SWAC) was the provincial government's  most recent attempt to disengage from the  issue. The committee, according to its own  report (May 31, 1988), was "independent of  government and industry." Its members included chairperson Dr. David Boyes, a gynecologist who initiated the use of the Pap  smear, and Edward Jeffries, president of  Cascade Chemical Commodities and a marketer of industrial chemicals for 35 years.  This committee was the government's  idea of a public process. SWAC went to  various communities to hear presentations.  The solutions...  already exist —  reduce, recycle,  redesign...  Then, in the middle of its "mandate,"  SWAC invited proposals for a toxic waste  disposal facility from garbage-for-profit corporations.  The committee chose a company: B.C.  Special Waste Services Inc., 75 percent  owned by ENSCO of El Dorado of Arkansas.  The committee toured again, looking for  communities who would beheve the promise of economic prosperity if they accepted  this proposal. The Business Association and  CouncUs of Ashcroft and Cache Creek invited the chosen company to town for a few  meetings, then organized a poU.  Thirty-five percent of an incomplete voters hst voted "yes" under the impression  they were asking for more information.  On this basis the Minister of Environment  Bruce Strachan put a full-page open letter  in the Ashcroft Journal, thanking the people for their support and for agreeing to "be  the focus of a valuable industry long overdue in British Columbia."  This "valuable industry" includes some of  the worst corporate citizens in North Amer-  i.  Since that poU on May 12, opposition  to siting a toxic waste incinerator, treatment plant and dump near Cache Creek has  steadUy grown. The minister is promising a  committee of review (to review what and by  whom?) Mowed by a referendum (where?).  The majority of local residents want an  immediate referendum and a moratorium  on the incinerator proposal. What we really  need is a province-wide capacity analysis for  waste reduction and recycling so these practices can begin to be implemented.  Why should any community be forced  to accept a toxic waste incinerator before waste reduction and recycling are a  reality ? Once an incinerator is buUt, there  is not much incentive to reduce toxic chemical use, and incinerators work best at fuU  capacity.  Incinerators create toxic waste and are an  unproven technology and a danger to the  ecology. Industry claims of 99.999 percent  destruction of toxic chemicals are based on  a few controUed text burns which are never  repeated. It is not possible to monitor an incinerator continuously for toxic emissions.  When toxic chemicals are burned, diox-  ins, furau and PCB's are formed. Dioxins  cause sterility, birth defects and cancers (see  page 15). They bio-accumulate (concentrate  in successive generations or stages of the  food chain) and have no safe level.  When toxic waste is burned, heavy metals are not destroyed, but are vapourized  out of the stack or remain as ash. The  ash is itself a toxic waste which must be  landfUled, creating additional environmental and health problems.  The solutions to our garbage problems  already exist—reduce, recycle and redesign  industrial processes and products. We must  ban production of toxic chemicals: for  ery barrel of product, several more barrels  of toxic waste are created.  The planet is in crisis. The domination of  nature by this hierarchical industrial mentality must stop. We now fear for hfe on  earth in terms of sudden nuclear disaster.  Toxic substances are working on us far more  insidiously, but with the same result. We  may end, truly, not with a bang, but a  whimper.

Seedlings, seniority—and sickness  by Lorraine Passchier  In one government tree farm nursery in  B.C., three women out of a skeleton crew  of 14 are presently being treated for cancer.  Another woman has already died.  These women routinely handled seedhngs  treated with pesticides.  While the acute effects of pesticides can  be manifested within minutes after contact, low-level or chronic exposure is entirely different—effects can take years. And  determining the cancer risk of pesticides is  difficult since no adverse effect may be apparent untU a large number of people actu-  aUy develop cancer.  Significantly, the women at the sUvicul-  ture nursery had between 13 and 20 years  experience as nursery workers and in terms  of seniority held the top four spots in their  workplace. WhUe no one has been able to  establish a direct hnk between these cancer  cases and the use of pesticides, the possibU-  ity does exist.  According to Dr. Bruce Dunn, a staff scientist at the Cancer Control Agency, "the  latency for cancer is 10 to 30 years." Dunn  also presented an argument which many  nursery workers are beginning to question.  He said, "The evidence is Uttle if any that  pesticides cause cancer ... A third to a  quarter of all people are going to die of cancer on the average and a 'cancer cluster' can  happen out of sheer chance."  On the other hand, Dunn said, "The lack  of studies does not prove pesticides safe."  WhUe most government agencies remain  neutral on the subject, there is a growing  concern among workers who are exposed  to pesticides. Nursery workers, for example, must extract seedhngs from the containers in which they've been cultivated and  sprayed. The workers then sort and bundle  the seedhngs before wrapping each bundle  individuaUy and placing them into a box.  At this point, they are sprayed with  the fungicide captan—although many other  chemicals may have been used. Captan was  commerciaUy introduced in 1951 and became a focus for public concern when The  Grapes of Wrath was published. In the  early 80's captan came under serious review  when it was discovered a major researcher  had faked the data for several pesticides.  As a result, ah of their studies had to be  retested.  "At that stage, captan became recognized as a potential carcinogen and the government made noises about banning it all  together," said a contractor at Surrey Nurs  ery. "But the farmers wanted it because it's  one of the cheapest and best pesticides."  But Carole Rubin, director of the B.C.  Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, said  the real heat was applied by the manufacturer of captan, who threatened to take the  government to court. Considering the enormous financial reserves of the manufacturer,  the threat did carry some weight. In any  case, captan was kept on the market.  Information officer for Agriculture Canada Roch Parisien, said, "In the early 80's  a fuU scientific review of captan indicated  long-term effects. There were some concerns  but it was kept on with some restrictive  measures. One was to reduce the concentration."  Perhaps a better indication of captan's  potency is the fact that since the review, the  government has not aUowed any new uses  for the fungicide.  WhUe working as a cook for tree planters,  Rubin received a first-hand account of captan's strength. She said captan is a heavy  duty fungicide and "the boxes of seedhngs  are permeated with the stuff." The boxes  came with warnings that no one should eat,  drink or smoke untU they had washed their  hands. Rubin said some tree planters disregarded the warnings and became UI with  vomiting or diarrhoea whUe others developed rashes.  The carcinogenicity of captan is more difficult to assess. Although there isn't epidemiologic information avaUable, there is  limited evidence of captan as an animal carcinogen. Since animal and human studies  are costly, the experimental data avaUable  on any pesticide is often limited.  On November 4th, at a benefit for  the Canadian Farmworkers, nursery worker  Chaouac Ferron reflected the concerns of  many when she said, "We know the toxicity  of pesticides. What we now need to know  is their carcinogenic potency. For instance,  captan is not a very toxic pesticide but its  carcinogenic potency may be high.  "We are waiting for the government to  provide us with a carcinogenic potency index so we can teU our employer: 'Look, captan and round-up are carcinogenics. They  rate poorly on the carcinogenic potency index chart.'  "At this point, without such a chart, I  don't think we can make any significant improvements in the workplace to protect ourselves against cancer."  Going a step further, Rubin asks the pertinent questions: "Why do we need fungicides? What creates the need for fungicides? How is that changeable?" Instead of  searching for 'safer' fungicides and conducting tests to evaluate their use, Rubin says  it's time we learned how to grow seedhngs  without the use of any fungicides.  In the meantime, workers are concerned  about their health and safety. And privatization brings additional worries: Who is going to be checking to see that safety regulations are enforced?  Many workers remain sUent about their  working conditions simply because they  have no choice—hke many others, they need  ■ the work. Certainly, no one wants to work  with pesticides. It's a question of having to.  .KINESIS  Dec/Jan. 89 EA/Wffl/MEfi/T  Dioxins:  The tip of a toxic iceberg  by Gwen Bird  You drip coffee through a white filter,  add milk from a white cardboard carton.  You use white tampons, white sanitary napkins, white toUet paper. White paper towels, white diapers.  You ingest and absorb dioxins.  You don't have much choice in Canada.  Alternative paper products—made without the chlorine bleaching process that  produces these highly toxic compounds—  simply aren't avaUable here.  Dioxins, in the news since the October  disclosure of their presence in carton milk,  belong to a larger group of synthetic toxins caUed organochlorines. Long known to  be hazardous, they are generated as byproducts of industrial processes such as pesticide, plastic and pharmaceutical manufacture, and forms of waste disposal hke industrial and municipal incineration.  Environmental activists are lobbying industry and government to regulate the production of dioxins and other organochlorines, and to make unbleached paper products avaUable in Canada.  Renate Kroesa, an industrial chemist,  is the international co-ordinator of Greenpeace's campaign for a dioxin-free pulp and  paper industry. She calls dioxins the tip of  the iceberg.  "Dioxins never come alone," Kroesa  points out, "but are always accompanied by  other chlorinated poisons."  Recently however, the focus for action  has been on the dioxin-producing pulp and  paper industry, of particular concern in  B.C. where 18 of the 21 pulp miUs use chlorine bleaching.  A coalition of B.C. consumer, labour  and environmental groups with a combined  membership of 100,000 recently called on  the pulp industry to do away with chlorine bleaching. The West Coast Environmental Law Association, the Steelhead Society of B.C., and the Consumers Association  of Canada (B.C.) were among the groups  involved.  Mellon, Crofton, Harmac, CampbeU River  and PoweU River.  Kroesa points out that organochlorines  are normally regarded as hazardous waste.  While B.C. searches for disposal options for  the 70,000 tonnes of hazardous waste "acknowledged to be generated" here each year  [see pg. 16], "the pulp industry is discharging three times this amount annually into  our waterways."  One wonders why environmental legislation—so talked of during the federal election campaign—does not prohibit  this dumping activity. In Canada, regulations for effluent from mills only measure two factors: Biological Oxygen De-  effluent, organochlorines occur as extremely  stable molecules and treatment processes  eliminate only about 30 percent of the compound.  The toxicity of the effluent is regulated  through fish testing, but only the short-term  effects are considered. Long term and accumulative effects are not addressed by current legislation.  The Most Toxic Substance  MeanwhUe, researchers working with a  dioxin caUed 2,3,7,8-TCDD have caUed it  the most toxic substance made by humans.

Of these, the most hazardous, and therefore  the most studied, are the chlorinated dioxins. They are described chemically by the positions on the benzene rings that are occupied by chlorine atoms, hence 2,3,7,8-TCDD has  four chlorines—a "tetrachloride."  Dioxins do not occur spontaneously in nature—only by human synthesis—and take a  long time to break down in the environment. In fact, since they have not existed for very  long, we have no way of knowing exactly how long they wUl last, and exactly how they wUl  mutate and modify as they do break down.  Tests done on rats and rhesus monkeys have yet to establish a "no effect level" of toxicity for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. That is, at the lowest tested dosages—amounts hke one triUionth  of the animal's body weight—both acute and chronic effects are observed.

Fish near pulp miUs in Sweden show  symptoms similar to PCB damage—impaired Uver function and poor reproductivity.  Crabs, oyster and shellfish near the Crofton,  B.C. miU are highly contaminated. And,  as the toxins move up the food chain, the  Crofton colony of great blue herons has  faUed to reproduce for the past two seasons  due to dioxin levels in their eggs.  As early as 1985, data presented to the  World Health Organization showed high  levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in human milk, an  especially alarming fact since nursing infants often depend on this sole source of  food, and since the immune system is particularly susceptible then.  The federal government claims the level  of dioxins discovered in the carton milk faU  within "acceptable levels." But at the same  time, there is evidence coming from scientific and environmental communities that  indicates, not surprisingly, that there is no  such thing as an "acceptable level" of dioxins. [See Box].  Health and Welfare Canada did not teU  the public what was going on when the  dioxin was discovered in mUk during routine testing. Instead, it was announced at an  international conference on dioxins in Sweden. Kroesa, a conference participant, says  it was "the bombsheU of the meeting."  Subsequently, the Ottawa Bureau of  Chemical Safety announced a one-and-a-  half miUion doUar project to investigate the  carton mUk, to establish how the dioxins get  into the cardboard, and from there, into the  milk. The study's goal is to " ... look at  the source (of dioxin in milk) and find out  what has to be done to minimize it at the  lowest reasonable level."  'The white inside  milk cartons is  purely cosmetic."  The national dairy council wants non-  chlorine bleached cartons. But according to  Kroesa, whatever alternative bleaching process they use, there wUl stiU be toxic residue  in the cardboard and it wUl leach into the  milk too. "The white inside milk cartons,  hke in aU packaging materials, is purely cosmetic."  The B.C. coalition has urged the provincial government to take leadership in promoting the avaUability of unbleached paper products. Bruce Strachan, B.C. Minister of the Environment, rephed it was not  within his mandate "to promote one particular product over another," and said it  was "nonsense" to accuse B.C. pulp miUs  of dumping organochlorines into our waterways.  There are other obvious solutions to the  problem. Since the chlorine bleaching process generates dioxins, they could be reduced or ehminated in pulp manufacture by  reducing the bleaching process.  As Kroesa puts it, "We need to ask ourselves whether aU those paper products we  use on a day-to-day basis, such as toilet paper, milk cartons and coffee filters really  need to be whiter than white. AU these  products can fulfill their purpose perfectly  weU even if brown.  "White ... must be associated with  dioxin. And dioxin and aU those other chlorinated poisons leach from the filter into our  coffee or from the carton into our glass of  milk."  Furthermore, for writing paper and other  products that need to be white, alternative bleaching technologies exist and are being used successfuUy in countries hke Sweden, Japan and West Germany where legislation has been introduced to regulate chlorine bleaching.

Some months later,  the Green Party of Canada was formed.  Members of the provincial party do not  necessarily become members of the federal party, and the two organizations  have separate constitutions.  In the wake of two decisions reached  at the summer Annual General Meeting  (AGM) of the Green Party of B.C., feminists in the party have formed an Ecofeminist Caucus.  At the AGM, the party moved to discontinue the use of consensus decision-making  (which had been used since 1984) in favour  of a traditional Robert's Rules/voting system; and secondly, to reject the addition  of "feminism" to the party's constitutional  values.  At present, the party's values embrace a  more socialist analysis of the causes of the  earth's destruction, whereas the Ecofeminist Caucus has as its Working Basis of  Unity the belief that "the forces which are  responsible for the competitive and patriarchal domination of women and oppressed  minorities are the same forces which are destroying the earth."  Earher, in April, the B.C. Greens held  a Feminism Conference where feminist concerns were aired openly. Presentations included "Feminism for Survival" and "A Single Mother's Perspective," and workshops  addressed the incorporation of feminist values at both the federal and provincial levels.  Although the workshop entitled "Are We  a Feminist Party?" did not emerge with a  positive answer, Laura Porcher, writing in  the Green Party News, felt the conference  was worthwhUe because a greater level of  trust was developed.  Unfortunately, the summer AGM at  which questions of feminism and consensus  arose was poorly attended. The group defeating consensus—largely represented by a  group of male, founding members of the  party—appeared to have done some back  room lobbying to counter the force of the  Feminism Conference.  The formation of the Ecofeminist Caucus marks a split in the B.C. Greens  which caucus members Bonnie Anderson  and Laura Porcher describe as a split between non-hierarchical, feminist values and  ...the real issues are  power...vision...  practice  the traditional patriarchal values enshrined  in the electoral system. Consensus decisionmaking is the crux of the matter.  Those who moved to replace consensus  with voting reasoned that consensus is valuable but takes too much time, said Anderson. But she feels the real issues are  "power," and the difference between creating a vision and putting it into practice. The  group which opposes consensus wants to get  power through elections, says Porcher.  Anderson says the ecology movement has  been understandably reluctant to join any  pohtical party. Caucus member Glen Makepeace adds that, reaUy, the Green Party's  presence in pohtics is, for the time, educational. Thus the Ecofeminist Caucus refuses  to accept an ideology which might make  it electable, but would undermine sincere  attempts to create an alternative pohtical  framework—and be believable as such.  The fact the caucus has formed signifies  that feminist men and women are not wUl-  ing to Mow the current trend in the party,  nor are they going to give up on the possi  bility of a feminist party. Anderson feels the  formation of the caucus is positive.  Interestingly, the Green Party of Canada  uses consensus and includes an ecofeminist  statement in its values. In the coming year,  one of the efforts of the Ecofeminist Caucus wUl be to bring the constitution, values  and pohcies of the B.C. Greens more in hne  with the federal Greens.  To develop the ecofeminist perspective and generate interest in the caucus, there will be several get-togethers  before the B.C. Greens AGM in March.  To participate, contact Bonnie Anderson at 875-9904 or Kathryn Cholette at  255-7287.  Ecofeminist caucus:  From the basis of unity  1. Advocating and engaging in affirmative action for women, working towards the elimination of the traditional patriarchal order. For example, in practical terms this means having more than fifty percent women as members of aU decision making bodies.  2. Working actively and consistently to achieve gender balance in group processes. This  includes intentionally alternating female and male speakers and eliminating gender biased  roles and language usage.  3. Supporting and strengthening the use of non-hierarchical structures. This means we  oppose traditional leadership models in society. Such leadership brings with it inequitable  distribution of authority, disempowerment and abdication of responsibility.  Dioxin from page 17  What We Consumers Want  What consumers can do is get the message  across to industry that we want unbleached  products. Kroesa points out that manufacturers of products hke Pampers and o.b.  tampons have toU-free telephone numbers  listed on their boxes, inviting consumers to  cad and give feedback.  Her advice: caU and ted them you don't  want them to use chlorine bleaching. "Better yet," she says, "wrap up the product,  used or not used, and sent it back saying  you do not want dioxin contaminated products."  Industry has done studies to establish  "acceptable risk levels" for products and  to investigate absorption by wet and dry  migration through the skin, she explains.  "What I find completely appalling as a  woman is that they found higher levels [of  absorption] for sanitary napkins than for diapers of toUet paper."  In the United Kingdom, an environmental women's network is trying to get  the word out about the hazards of using  chlorine-bleached sanitary products. They  plan to launch a major campaign beginning  in February, 1989, using mass media vehicles hke the BBC and Cosmopolitan mag-  A range of unbleached paper products  is now avaUable some places in Europe.

Her  rapid speech with a heavy Nova Scotian accent and difficulty pronouncing consonants  meant that "no one could understand me  when I spoke in Toronto."  The 31 year-old singer and her brothers and sisters grew up in a combination of  foster homes, hving at different times with  different parents, shifting from the Black  neighbourhood of Hahfax to New Jersey  and finally to Toronto.  This interview was conducted in November whUe Nolan was in Vancouver for a concert at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre.  Sadie: What was growing up Black in  Nova Scotia like?  Faith: In Hahfax, Black people hved in  the north and white people hved in the  south. Things were very clearly segregated.  And today it remains clearly segregated.  Black people were oppressed, were shut  out of professional and semi-professional  jobs, and could not gain the poUtical and  economic power necessary to effect change  in government. The church used to control  the community, but it has lost power.  If you are working class your Ufe isn't  vahdated—therefore your people are in-  vaUd. You don't really miss riches because  you don't have riches—you aspire to what  you know.  What we are taught is that we are poor  because we are lazy, but that is untrue. We  make cars and buUd houses, yet we are not  paid a fair wage—that's what keeps us poor.  Sadie: Are people in Nova Scotia  aware of Black history ?  Faith: Black history is stiU not mandatory in the schools. This Umits how other  people understand the way things are—hke  high unemployment rates.  Few people know there were prosperous  Black communities, hke Shelbourne in the  1850's. But white people were jealous, and  they burned it down, running the Black people out, and buUding their own city on the  site.  Sadie: What is your sense of the  awareness of Black history in the general Canadian public, given that there  were Black settlements across Canada  since the last century?  Faith: When you want to oppress a  people you either delete their history or  negate it. What appears to be an absence  of African history is ready a suppression, ignoring things Uke Timbuktu—the museums  and strong governments there.  People are only as strong as their history  and culture—so to keep people down you  exclude them from the history books. That  is one of the "neat" things about colonialism.  The history of women hke Mary Ann  Shadd or Arlie Robbins of Buxton are unknown, so there is no historical example for  Black women.  The known historical figures are people  hke John A. MacDonald or John Diefen-  baker. The model to aspire to is not a pos-  sibUity for a Black woman. So she gets the  message that she does not fit in, she doesn't  belong, she hasn't contributed anything.  It is a way of keeping people down, keeping them back from achieving full equahty.  And that is a deUberate feature of people  who hold power in this society.  Too Little Direct Action  Sadie: Do you see room in the feminist  movement in Canada for the issues of   £  race and class to be addressed?  Faith: The problem with feminism is  that the people with the resources to put  out what they have to say have been  predominantly white middle class women.  They only talked about issues that were important to them—thinking they were able  to speak knowingly on the issues of aU  women, across race and class Unes.  In terms of direct action, too Uttle is being done. Women are stiU focussed on personal issues and aren't wUUng or able to  look at the larger picture of race and class.  Examples of this include the situation  at Regents Park in Toronto, a large housing project that is about 60 percent Black  women. There are no feminist groups going  there to raUy support around these Black  women being made to suffer class oppression.  The second example is the shooting of a  Black youth, Anthony Griffiths, by a white  poUce officer in Montreal. There was no rallying of the feminist community against this  action.  by Louise Allen  BORN A WOMAN  Seven Canadian Women  Singer-Songwriters  by EUen Schwartz  Winlaw: Polestar PubUshers, 1988  $12.95  Heather Bishop, Ferron, Marie-Lynn  Hammond, Connie Kaldor, Rita MacNeU,  Lucie Blue Tremblay, Sylvia Tyson: Canadian women who "write with conviction  about their own experiences ... who write  from the heart."

How  she does this is one of the strengths of the  book.  Schwartz's writing style is clean, simple and descriptive. Quotes, excerpts from  songs and sUce-of-Ufe descriptions are mixed  together to bring out the special talents of  each woman. Some of these descriptions are  But there is a lot of support for women  who take workshops to rid themselves of  racism, but there is no move to concrete action.  Sadie: When did you have a sense  that you were a lesbian?  Faith: I grew up gay or lesbian. I first  knew when I was 12. I started spending  time at lesbian and gay clubs on the weekends when I was 14. I've been out for about  20 years so I've worked a lot of things  through—the embarrassment, the rage, and  shame. So I can be strong about being a lesbian.  Sadie: Were there many Black women in Halifax who identified as being  lesbian?  Faith: There were three Black women  who identified themselves as lesbians.

One  hand raised, she sings with aU the music  in her voice:  We are children in the rafters,  We are babies in the park,  We are lovers at the movies,  We are candles in the dark ...  Whether you're a struggling performer  or simply a lover of women's music, there  are many interesting and encouraging anecdotes in these stories. Did you know that,  up to the age of 25, Heather Bishop thought  she was tone deaf? Or that Rita MacNeU,  whose last album sold more than 100,000  copies, cannot read music?  The one controversial topic discussed is  feminism, and responses are as varied as  the women themselves. Connie Kaldor sees  feminists as "people who actively work to  change the status of women in society." Apparently, she doesn't count herself as one.  Heather Bishop, on the other hand, is a feminist simply because she is a woman. "It's  from hving my hfe that I became a feminist ... from never receiving equal pay ...  from watching friends get beaten by their  husbands."  With the wealth of good singer-songwriters today, it must have been difficult to  chose which women to profile; I think this  selection works. We're given a variety of  women whose talents span three decades,  creating an appreciation for the historical  growth of women's music. It's easy to forget  that in the late 50's the closest thing Sylvia  Tyson had to a role model, as she says, were  black male artists singing over the Detroit  radio.  My main criticism is that aU the women  come off being a bit too nice. Perhaps the  author deUberately chose to avoid looking  at the not-so-wonderful side of each individual. I respect the decision, but I miss the  warts.  I'm glad this book was written. I have an  emotional connection with each performer  that goes back to the first women's festival I  attended.

V6A 1H2  253-1224  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL WOMEN'S PRESS  KINESIS <as**sss^$ssssss^  ARTS  Lesbian Film Fest  Memory, sexual desire on the screen  by Jeannie Lochrie  With over 17 films to choose from, film-  [ goers to Vancouver's International Lesbian  FUm Festival were served a rich celluloid  smorgasbord: documentary and experimental, shorts and features, including works by  local filmmakers.  Film content was complex and varied,  but two major themes were evident in works  made by and for lesbian audiences: memory  and sexual desire.  Creating a sense of lesbian herstory was  evident in almost aU documentaries. In her  exquisitely filmed A Displaced View, Midi  Onodera journeys via the collective memory of her Japanese-Canadian family "relocated" during the Second World War. The  journey becomes a metaphor for Onodera's  lesbian culture, a sub-culture consistently  relocated outside the memory of the dominant culture.  Filmmakers Greta SchUler and Andrea  Weiss create an amazing piece of herstory in  International Sweethearts of Rhythm—  voted one of the best of the fest. This account of an aU-women interracial jazz band  combines present-day interviews with ex-  band members, stiU photos and film footage  of women, women, women: in factories, in  the band, singing, dancing and having a gay  old time. We're given wonder-fuU, subversive herstorical memories of the women's  culture that developed when the boys were  at war.  Especially riveting was Su Friedrich's  avant-garde Damned If You Don't. Combining both sexual desire and memory,  Friedrich weaves a complex and beautiful  tapestry between the real and the imaginary, giving Ufe to that repressed CathoUc  memory: the Lesbian Nun.  Magic best describes the final hot seduction and love-making scene between a young  nun and her artist neighbour. It is as if the  uun, in her medieval garb, UteraUy transcends time and space to take her rightful  place in our collective lesbian memory. The  reel becomes the real.  Speaking of erotica, local filmmaker  Lorna Boschman's visually pleasing Butch/  Femme in Paradise was wUdly applauded. It was filmed along the beautiful "female" shorehne of the Gulf Islands, with its seductive breast/thigh/beUy-  looking lava rocks. In five minutes of pure  erotic fantasy we find a fun fantasy of seduction and lesbian sex that works.  Unfortunately, not aU was pleasurable  film testing. The three films highlighting the festival—She Must Be Seeing  Things, Seduction: The Cruel Woman,  and Kamikaze Hearts were anything but  a high. Most women I spoke to found them  depressing.  Seeing Things: I asked myself, "Did  filmmaker SheUa McLaughlin dehberately  try to make a B movie?—B for bad acting?"  I found nothing feminist about this film. It's  the story of two lovers: Jo, beautiful femme  filmmaker with a heterosexual past; and  Agatha, her antagonistic agonized lover, obsessed with Jo's sexual herstory. Dressing  up as a butch-gangster-voyeur, Agatha follows Jo and imagines her sleeping with every tom/dick/harry she meets.  McLaughlin repeatedly serves up a disturbingly violent image of Agatha's fantasy  of Jo being shot dead, gangster style, for  her imagined sexual "indiscretions." Excuse  me, but what is the point? Is McLaughlin  being ironic, maybe referring to the shooting of film?  Seduction: A Cruel Woman was no  more woman-positive. For many viewers, it  was an unbearably long 90 minutes. Set in  an s/m brothel-theatre, Seduction sheds  absolutely no feminist hght on s/m.  Example: Wanda, the cruel dominatrix  who looks more hke a drag queen, "directs"  a scene for a rather unemotional-looking  paying audience. "The permanent sign of  slavery is the bleeding rose," she says as the  camera pans to a woman carving out a rose  on another woman's flesh.  Anti-feminist statements abound in Seduction.  Samples:  "Slaves are plentiful.  And they won't become extinct. There wiU  always be an excess of slaves;" "I am a  tyrant;" "My passion is aroused by your  suffering;" "Hate me. Lock me up in your  room," and so on, ad nauseum.  Kamikaze Hearts, the third feature  film, was truly depressing. It is the b/anal  film autobiography of two women lovers  From Because The Daw  who produce and star in porn films for men.  Hearts ends with Tigr and Mitch shooting up junk. "This is my dick," Mitch says,  "and she [Tigr] loves it." In 20 years or so  this film might have some archival interest.  However, most of the women I talked with  were thoroughly confused and depressed by  it. A bleak vision indeed.  No film festival would be complete without a heartthrob and that award certainly  goes to Edwidge Belmore, French recording  star and bohemian cabaret performer, who  starred in the aU-too-short vampire flick  Because the Dawn.  TotaUy seductive in colour, costume and  music, the vampire Marie gives new meaning to vamp. She sings a fabulous solo—and  yes, she does really play that sax!  For aU of tins, filmmaker Amy Goldstein is dealing with serious issues in Dawn.  Underneath Marie's seductive-exterior is a  monster-interior; under the glamour and seduction Ues a subtext of violence. Marie's  character becomes a metaphor for film in  general, especially the mainstream. Lurking  beneath film's "entertainment value" Ues  ideology. Always.  In this hght, Dawn can be viewed as a  cautionary tale warning us to be aware of  who and what we allow to seduce our psyches and our poUtics.  A festival such as this does incredible  things for lesbian visibUity and deserves to  become an annual event. Kudos to the volunteer women who organized such a resoundingly successful event.  Another view  A feast for intensity addicts  by Lorna Boschman  It was hke being at the opening of a  Broadway play. Instead of furs, there were  leather jackets and casual clothes at the  First International Lesbian Film Festival.  But the feeUng wa spectacular—on the  screen were our films, our culture, and in  the audience were our people. (Okay, only  90 percent of the crowd were lesbians. But  you get the picture.)  In total, over 2,000 people attended the  four evenings of the Festival. The October  event was one of the greatest acts of lesbian  visibUity we have seen in Vancouver.  Because it was so thought-provoking,  Kamikaze Hearts was my favourite film.  The story concerns the real-life love between  porn star Sharon 'Mitch' MitcheU and Tigr  Mennett, a member of the porn flick crew.  Tigr worked with director JuUet Bashore to  write the script. Documentary scenes are  combined with re-enacted ones to form a  collage of Ufe behind the sets. The subject is the manufacture of commercial sexual myth: Tigr wonders if her relationship  is just another scenario to Mitch.  The film is about the search for more, the  need to fiU that aching hole caUed a heart.  It was a feast for intensity addicts Uke myself. Mitch was so cool, right from the opening sequence. Arriving in San Francisco, she  rides in the back of a convertible, hair flying  hi the wind, shades down, dreaming aloud  of the surreal film she and Tigr are making  together.  Mitch is always "on:" as a performer in  the commercial sex scenes, as an interviewer  of other porn workers, even when she is  alone with Tigr. They met whUe performing  sex for the camera, and became obsessed.  Tigr realizes that, to keep up with Mitch,  she must join her in mainlining cocaine. In  the closing scenes, the burning passion has  degenerated to a cool stoned state—they  are naked and talking junkie babble.  "Mitch"  It's not what I'd caU glamour.  This was an insider's look at the porn  biz—not the viewpoint of a social worker  or a voyeuristic male. Tigr and Mitch controlled the content of Kamikaze Hearts.  This contrasts sharply with the porn industry, where the producer has control. In this  film, the producer (who plays himself) is  particularly sleazy and obnoxious.  Self-definition is a powerful tool. To allow your Ufe to be scrutinized by strangers,  on a giant screen and in stereo, is simultaneously egotistical and educational. Mitch  and Tigr succeed in making themselves into  mythological beings. By the end, both the  performers and the audience are unable to  distinguish fantasy from documentary.  But ironicaUy, it is aU true: Tigr calls the  film a "docu-dreama."  Documentary is a tradition among groups  excluded from mainstream cinema: we make  ourselves visible by creating self-images. Interestingly, half the films at the festival were  documentaries.  The question of how to be visible is an  important one for lesbians. Questions are  raised hke: how do we reach our audience?  Do we show our work to men? Do we aUow|  the government, via its classification system, to censor lesbian works?  Thanks to the Vancouver East Cinema  and festival organizers for bringing these  controversial works out of smaUer fringe  venues and presenting them to the general public in its large theatre. This festiva  showed the power that wider visibUity can  bring to a community.   AINESIS  Dec/Jan. 89 ARTS  ///////////////////////^^^^  Combining politics and rich imagery  by Cecilia Diocson  A RUSTLING OF LEAVES  Inside the Philippine Revolution  Written, produced and directed  by Nettie WUd  Nettie WUd's A Rustling of Leaves is  a film where poUtics and rich imagery combine to weave a powerful portrait of PhiUp-  pine social reality. Set amidst a complex and  grim poUtical landscape, the film shows a  Third World country caught in the crossfire between a national hberation movement  and a ruhng ehte unwUUng to give up its  privUege.  After viewing the film, one can hardly escape the view that, two years after Marcos, little has changed for the majority of  people. Cory Aquino's presidency has not  slowed the grinding poverty and intensifying mihtarization. The existing democratic  space is slowly being eroded by the activities of death squads and vigUante groups,  miUtary coup attempts, intimidations and  even kUlings of trade unionists and leaders  from the legal left.  One disturbing aspect of the film is  Aquino's open endorsement of the vigilante groups. This clearly identifies her with  Third World right-wing poUtics. Here is a  woman—whose husband died by the hands  of right-wing assassins—now embracing the  pohtics and methods of right-wing death  squads. No wonder the U.S. was almost jubilant in its support for her.  To be left-wing in the PhiUppines is to  risk poUtical assassination. The poUtical  process is being reduced to the right and  center of the poUtical spectrum: any deviation from this becomes fair game to the vigUante groups.  WUd pointed out, in a post-screening discussion, that what happens in the PhiUppines seems to be part of a worldwide pat  tern of U.S. involvement in stamping out  Uberation movements, whether they are legal or not. Low Intensity Conflict, death  squads, religious fanaticism, even "demonstration elections" are standard tools in  parts of the globe where U.S. interests are  at stake. In the Philippines, American interests include the largest military base outside the continental U.S., and economic investments worth over $4 bUUon.  The film addresses the dUemma facing the legal left regarding armed struggle. While former gueriUa leader-turned-  poUtician Dante Buscayno considers armed  struggle to be secondary to parliamentary  struggle, this is one question hotly debated  within the legal left. In a transitional society such as the PhiUppines, the legal left  is caught in an unenviable position of either being pushed underground by the military and death squads—thereby depriving  the people of a legal poUtical alternative—  or staying above ground, risking threats and  A week-long festival of performances, forums and workshops celebrating B.C.  women performing artists is slated for January 17 to 22 in Vancouver (pictured  above is Yellow Wallpaper). Sitar recitals, theatre, dance, performance art, clowning, storytelling—as well as skill exchange workshops (with limited enrollment)  are featured.     For detailed program information and tickets, contact 875-6210.  Today, the left continues to operate  openly. It refuses to be driven underground.  As for the underground left, the film  treats us with some intense images of its  day-to-day activities. The underground is  ordinary people, forced by necessity to take  up arms. ChUdren in school huts singing  "We are part of the revolution" convey the  message of the continuity and protracted-  ness of the struggle for national Uberation.  There is no lack of determination among  these people.  There may be times when "moral is  low"—one gueriUa leader radios his comrades after a failed ambush. But there is no  question of giving up. Another leader says  she wUl now have to change her name once  more in order to elude the miUtary.  There is, however, one conspicuous item  missing in the film—the role and presence  of the women's movement. Whether WUd is  aware of this or not, the women's movement  is a significant player in the national Uberation struggle. Either in the open or in the  underground, PhiUppine women and their  organizations constitute a large portion of  the movement.  In presenting the legal left, the film never  mentioned Gabriela, the largest and most  mihtant women's organization. Hardly anything was said about the senatorial candidate, NeUa Sancho, who is Gabriela's general secretary.  One does not quibble with the film's depiction of Dante Buscayno as symbohc of  the legal left. After aU, he has proven his  mettle as gueriUa fighter, pohtical prisoner  and pohtician. But subsequent events in  the PhiUppines would prove that the legal  left and Buscayno seemed to have distanced  themselves from each other: Buscayno has  gone back to his hometown and not much is  heard from him lately.  NeUa Sancho, meanwhUe, continues to be  involved in the legal left. She leads Gabriela  in fighting for women's rights and national  Uberation, giving it international prominence.  The film did not even say anything  about the underground women's organization know as Makibaka (UteraUy translated  as Free Association of New Women), one of  the earliest members of the National Democratic Front (NDF)—the united front that  is engaged in armed struggle for national  hberation. Makibaka contributes scores of  women fighters to the New People's Army-  the NDF military wing. Also, this is the  group that provides women leaders in the  underground.  The influence and significance of the  women's movement is strong enough that  the NDF decided last year to include  women's issues and concerns as one of its  14 major programs.  Despite this lack, A Rustling of Leaves  deserves to be seen. It tells us much about  present poUtical reality in the PhiUppines.  It shows western audiences that behind the  glitter and avowed democracy that supposedly prevails in the PhiUppines of Cory  Aquino, oppressive structures remain—and  a national democratic revolution continues  to surge forward.

Detective work calls for a problem solver  who can deal with home, chUdren, lover and  the job aU at the same time. In fact, it's  work made for a woman.  Vancouver writer Elisabeth Bowers belongs to the worker's coUective at Uprising  Breads on Venables in East Vancouver. Her  first novel Ladies' Night, revised for pub-  Ucation during time out from the bakery,  introduces Meg Lacey, a middle-aged, divorced mother of two almost-adult chUdren  who has her black belt in Aikido six years  after being raped in a supermarket parking  lot.  Meg is a reluctant investigator who inherits a detective agency from a friend who died  of lung cancer. And she needs the money.  The reader is in famiUar territory: the  multi-racial city. Meg's search for two miss-  women, in and around Vancouver, cov-  the town from the back lanes of East  Hastings to the bar of the Sylvia Hotel, to  the corner of Clark and Venables, surely the  ugliest intersection in the east end.  Thrills and chills from private eyes  by Patricia Maika  The beam from Meg Lacey's private eye  shows real corruption and human decay  beneath the everyday sleaze of the city.  Kinky's, a nightclub on Hastings—no cover  charge, free drinks on ladies' night—turns  loose the paying customers (men armed  with money, drugs and offers of screen tests)  to prey on underage girls. The night club  fronts a chUd pornography operation and a  drug ring, and is the scene of two murders.  Yet, Bowers' writing is complex rather  than sensational: the gripping mystery (you  have to keep reading) is, in part, a vehicle  for the author's exploration of the hfe of a  working woman. The characters are believable (even the cops are human), the style  laconic, funny, economical.  WhUe developing themes of sexual and  racial abuse, the author gets across, with  only a hint of being didactic, perceptive  comments on relationships between lovers  and friends: "Many people insist on trusting their mates in the face of all kinds of  evidence against them;" or "He can't stand  not being able to rescue me. And I don't  want to be rescued."  And, she suggests a teenage fantasy before pulp romances intervene may weU be:  "A boyfriend who was also a comrade,  a fellow-fighter against enemies and injustice."  Bowers is currently at work on a fantasy  novel for chUdren. Fantasy can, of course,  project new possibiUties for reality by exploring what is, in some way, mysterious.  One hopes that Ladies' Night is the first  of a body of such work by this writer.  Far from reaUty and anything but fantastic is Helen Keremos, the peripatetic,  lesbian detective of Toronto writer Eve  Zaremba's Beyond Hope. The third book  in a series featuring the adventurous Helen (others were Work for a Million and  A Reason to Kill) takes us on a wUd  and incomprehensible chase from Los Angeles to Vancouver, Nelson and Castlegar  Elisabeth Bowers  and through the East Kootenay mountains  in search of a mysterious woman involved  (so the blurb tells us) in multinational terrorism.  Unfortunately, Zaremba's characters, a  huge array of them, Doukhobors, Native  people, lesbian separatists, bumbling terrorists with names Uke Sid and Harry, are  so superficially drawn, so seldom show any  emotion, that one finds it difficult to care  what they do. The plot involves several car  chases, abductions, secret agents and murder.  FoUowing an exhausting day looking for  clues, Helen Keremos—whose anxiety never  keeps her awake at night—does Uttle more  than raise a laugh with this kind of narrative: "I slept. When I woke I was looking  into the barrel of a gun ... I groaned and  roUed over."  Or, foUowing an abduction, attempted  murder and an escape on foot through miles  of rugged mountain country, a relaxed Helen  gives out with the foUowing: "I took off my  clothes, cUmbed into bed, set my portable  alarm and was asleep before I touched the  pUlow."  CUches abound. Reading tins book is a  struggle; figuring out the turns of the plot  is Uke talking with a bad conversationalist who changes the subject with every sentence. Beyond Hope has Uttle real sense of  place: the action could, Uke many a movie,  as easUy take place in the United States as  in Nelson. Which is a pity. For there are undeniably interesting possibiUties for fiction,  barely touched on by Zaremba, among the  people and in the setting of the East Koote-  nays. Ruthless editing and work on character development would be a good place to  start.  A full table of tasty words  by Eunice Brooks  GETTING THE HOUSEWORK  DONE FOR THE DANCE  by Libby Oughton  Toronto: WUUams-WaUace PubUshers, 1988  This coUection of ideas, metaphors, plots  and searches is a book for people who  Uke women, and want to know more about  them. I seem not to want to use the term  anthropological (because of the mascuUne  root), but there is more than a passing flirtation with woman-study here.  Openings run rampant throughout the  poems—from the torn hymen (her "white  rose"), to her wedded life (her "merry/  age"), to the holes in her network of women.  In Oughton's juicy prose poem "Shadow  Lovers," the opening is a prelude to copulation. In the prelude she is her own lover,  an amazon no man can relate to.  "and we bleed ... " is the first solved  riddle of blood in which she awakens to  women's reality. Her introduction to motherhood is bloody. Her sisters "scrub teUtale  coins from clothes ..." and there is a vivid  F6^VAL,fDA^A»»L'eMT  .KINESIS   Dec./Jan.89"  image of her sister spht and peeled during a mastectomy. Finally there is the dead  blood of an old woman's body, no family or  friends, frozen in a morgue with the treasures of hfe itemized in a purse, destined to  no claim but the one Oughton feels when she  hears of the sister-friend, name unknown.  For those of us who lose interest in one-  dish meals, Oughton serves up a full table of tasty works: quotes, and dedications  to Gwendolyn MacEwan, free verse, prose,  webbing, essays, and witty word play to  tempt the reader to keep on swaUowing the  offerings. I read the book on the plane trav-  eUing from Charlottetown where Oughton  hves, to Vancouver. But I've kept it close  to me for a month now, because I'm learning more about myself as I reopen her case  for the defence of linguistic twists of mother  tongue.  Brews and bruises, the lot of women in  Oughton's experience, fiU these 38 poems.  In her poem "sweeping up the mess," she  says: "it's time damn it/ get out the broom/  that's me/ Uttering floors and walls ..."  When she cannot find her heart, Oughton  does not give up. She finds a magic marker.  With that outdrawing of magic known to  great women, she puts a new heart on her  sleeve. That's the heart of her lore: the remaking of the lost. She loses nothing as her  words sUde down onto paper. Oughton hits  womanliness with a soft kiss. Her book is  for those of us who have loved and learned. ARTS  //////////////////////^^^^^  Le Guin  From the deepest,  most secret cave  by Nym Hughes  As a science fiction and fantasy addict  since the age of ten, I've read a lot of crap.  I've also read inspiring and empowering visions of possible future societies. Ursula Le  Guin wrote many of them.  I saw Le Guin interviewed twice at the  recent Vancouver Writer's Festival. On October 26, she sat flanked by huge flower arrangements in the GranvUle Island Room  and talked with Rob Jobe, Chair of the  ChUdren's Literature Round Table. Jobe's  questions as weU as those from the audience  focussed mostly on the process of writing.  "I have always written," said Le Guin.  "My older brother taught me when I was  four or five and writing is what I have always done ... I sent my books out for  seven years. I found a door into publication  and that door had a big sign over it caUed  'genre." Professors and critics won't look at  anything coming through that door."  Her eariiest SF books were published in  the 60's, a time when few women were  writing that genre. No one wrote Uke she  wrote—stories of exUe and community, imperialism and resistance, isolation and love.  Stories about people struggling with gender,  with relationships, with poUtics.  The Left Hand of Darkness (1969)  won the two major SF awards that year (the  Hugo and the Nebula) as did The Dispossessed (1974), an exploration of an anarchist society.  Le Guin said about The Dispossessed,  "I had been reading the great pacifist-  anarchist writers and theoreticians and realized that no one had ever written their  utopia. There were no works of fantasy using that social structure."  There haven't been any since, either, except for Le Guin's own "Eye Of the Heron"  (1978) and several of her short stories. She  spoke also of another major influence on her  work: Taoism.  "I read Taoist writings when I was very  young," she said. "It's a general frame of  reference, the way I think ... Taoism is  a counsel of secrecy and sUence. Famous  Taoists are always men and they went off  and hved in caves."  Le Guin's version was "to hve in a perfectly ordinary house and bring up your  perfectly ordinary chUdren and wear perfectly ordinary clothes and that's the deepest most secret cave of aU."  I watched Le Guin answering questions  and ordinary was not the word that came to  my mind. She hstened carefuUy to the questioner, answered thoughtfuUy. She spoke as  if aU of us were writers, as if to coUeagues,  to peers. She was respectful, kind.  "AU professional writers are pretty methodical about their time," she said. "Hit's  what you do, you end up going to your desk  at the same time. Mine is early morning. I  work untU noon or so. That sounds very dis-  cipUned and virtuous ... There's the times  of staring out the window, of thinking 'oh,  I really should clean the kitchen.'  "When I have finished a major work  I have always been convinced 'that's it.'  Waiting for the weU to fiU up again is hard,  but I trunk you should go to your desk and  wait there. Write diaries, write letters, write  exercises, but write."  Go Step-by-Step  Le Guin was also interviewed by Judith  MerrUl, another long-time SF writer and  editor. Same flower arrangements and the  house was packed. MerrUl raised the issue  of white women writers in Canada being  asked by women of colour not to write from  the point of view of a woman of colour.  Said MerrUl, a white woman, "I react very  strongly to this ... I think writers should  try anything."  Le Guin, also a white woman, responded.  "I think we should never ted each other we  should write this or that. We must not censor, but I differ from you. Perhaps as an anthropologist's daughter ... I think of Native American culture as one I know a httle about. I know Native Americans as people who have been spoken for—considered  not able to speak—for a couple of hundred years and who do not want to be spoken for. I would feel not only intensely self-  conscious, but appropriately gmlty ... It's  a very sticky thing. You just go step-by-step  and foot-by-foot. There are no rules ..."  A member of the audience, a white  woman, later said how uncomfortable she  felt hstening to Le Guin and MerrUl talk  about this request from women of colour  without acknowledging that white people  speak and write from inside a system of  white dominance. Le Guin said discomfort  was a highly appropriate emotion.  Le Guin's recent book Always Coming  Home was another focus of questions and  comments. Five years in the writing, it's a  multi-layered complex work. Le Guin describes it as "not about moving from place  to place. It's about being in one place. My  image of this book is a house. The reader  comes in any door they hke ...

Jeanette Armstrong, a writer of the  Okanagan people, spoke of recognizing the  traditional Native American setting and  world view in Always Coming Home.  Le Guin responded, "I felt I was on  thin ice ... Always Coming Home is set  20,000 years in the future but it's set in a  real place, the Napa Valley in California,  one of my homes all of my hfe. I was trying to find a people who were worthy of Uv-  ing there, because we're not. We're using it  for agri-business, milking it for money ...  What tradition did I have to draw on? Nothing European would do.  "The people who hved there and treated  the land weU for many, many years were,  of course, the Native American people. The  people who hved there were completely  wiped out ... I turned to other West Coast  traditions, oral tradition ... I tried not to  copy, not to use, not to expropriate, but to  learn. How do you treat the earth if you reaUy Uve there?"  Armstrong repUed that she appreciated  the book. "I didn't feel you were appropriating but were using it as a learning and  teaching tool," said Armstrong. "But it is  a subtle form of racism when Taoism and  anarchism are seen as plulosophies but Native American thought is not. Why is Native American thought not aUowed to stand  on its own? Why is it always called something else?"  It was very exciting for me to hsten to these  conversations. It seemed a bit amazing-  sitting in a mainstream arts event listening  to women discuss racism and writing and  feminism whUe hundreds listened. Le Guin  and MerrUl talked about gender, about  whether there was any difference between  women's and men's writings, about sexism  in the SF field.  "Given the construction of gender in our  society, writing has belonged to men," said  Le Guin. "Literacy was a jealously guarded  elite privUege ... Poor men and women began to be taught to write in the 17th, 18th,  19th centuries and suddenly we had a new  art form—the novel...  "Now, stiU, most publishers are male,  most editors are male. Literature is stiU a  male preserve ... I started out writing 'like  a man.' I was a writer so aU my main characters were male. That it could be different was brought to me in my Ufe by women  who were thinking harder than me, who said  "We have things to say that haven't been  said before."  "We don't yet know where a women's Ut-  erature wUl take us. It's taking us a lot of  exciting places. When women began writing  science fiction, the field changed. Irrevocably ...  "I can't define feminism, but I know what  I've gotten. I've been given freedom. I've  gone places in my writing that I could never  have gone."  And taken us with you, Ursula. Thanks.  * * *T SOLST/CgQiPTiPgAS...

And  as the saying goes, if you Uked the others,  you'U love this one!  Set far in the future when space travel involves leaps through time, Clayton's books  are always fun to read. She's not a teller of  that grim kind of story that takes contemporary Ufe to its worst conclusions. Sure,  the plots centre around famiUar causes—  rescuing poUtical prisoners, for example—  but the writing is always wry and witty.  Her female characters are particularly  wonderful and rarely daunted. My favourite  scene occurs early in the book. Timka,  Skeen's good friend and a "shape-changer,"  is out to explore a new city, enjoying dinner  at a spectacular restaurant:  ... in a maUeable chair that tucked itself around her, supporting her in unobtrusive comfort at a free-form table that  curved about her so she wouldn't have to  stretch for anything, chair and table on  short, sUky realgrass, a small rose arbour  behind her ... with stars that gUttered  above and below her.  Warmly  replete  and  happy  with  the  world, she is interrupted by an obnoxious and insistent man who demands to  know "her price." At first merely irritated,  Timka becomes infuriated with his arrogant behaviour. The resolution of this familiar scenario of sexual harassment is all the  more sweet because the jerk—not suspecting Timka's power to transform herself into  any shape—never expects to lose.  Skeen's spaceship has a female persona so  it, too, takes an active role in the action—  "beUy down, teeth bared"—as it tracks the  enemy. CaUed Picarefy, the ship has its own  personality, sometimes sarcastic, occasion-  aUy wistful, but always fierce in its protection of Skeen and the others.  This one is a good read. Don't worry  if you haven't seen the first two books in  WOKlttf  the series (Skeen's Leap, and Skeen's Return), because Clayton brings you quickly  up-to-date in her opening pages.  THE POWER OF TIME  by Josephine Saxton  Hogarth Press, 1985  This book is the first coUection of Sax-  ton's short fiction. A weU-established SF  writer, her work verges into the fantasy  stream of the genre. The stories are clever,  imaginative and somewhat macabre: intellectual horror stories.  Take "No Coward Soul" as an example. This ultimate self-help story begins  with Nadine, a woman who is determined  to take matters into her own hands: "She  has spent a, lot of time practising and researching, picking up knowledge from med-  . ical friends, reading ... She knows the process by heart."  Menstrual extraction? Self-hypnosis? No,  neither process is the object of these careful preparations. Long the "victim of her  own violent temper," Nadine's goal is au-  tosurgery of her own brain. She plans to  instaU a mechanism to induce feehngs of  acceptance and peacefulness whenever rage  threatens to engulf her.  As the surgery proceeds to its irreversible  conclusion, Nadine's spirit tries to warn her  about the simplicity of her solution for dealing with the world: could there be a use for  anger, could it be the source of pride, of determination, of strength?  H you have ever wished for an on-off  switch of your own, "No Coward Soul" wiU  change your mind!  While none of the stories in this collections are exactly cheerful reading, "The  Snake who had Read Chomsky" comes closest to being humourous. It's a satirical look  at behavioural science, and, in particular,  at scientists who compete bitterly with each  other for the glory of making an important  discovery.  The story Mows three thoroughly un-  Ukable characters as they attempt to use  their secret discovery to destroy one another. Since the secret is a remote control device that can induce animal-like behaviour in humans, some very strange incidents occur.

The idea  of a collection of stories and poems about  animals, even by Ursula Le Guin, (see pg.  23), didn't appeal to me. But in the end,  I couldn't resist reading something new by  this author, especiaUy when she had just  visited Vancouver.  The title story, "Buffalo Gals, Won't You  Come Out Tonight," was written especially  for this collection. It's a beautiful noveUa  about a chUd who survives a plane crash  and enters a mythic community of animals  where she is nurtured and educated about  the nature of Ufe.  FiUed with rich, colourful detaU, it has  aU the conventions of the "talking animal"  story: Jay yeUs, Horse has a large, cheerful laugh, Doe is deUcate and soft-eyed and  Coyote has a lazy-looking rangy walk that's  so hard to keep up to. But what is extraordinary about Le Guin's telUng of the story  is that she doesn't ask us to "suspend our  disbeUef." Instead, she invites us to examine it through the experience of the chUd.  The chUd, called Gal by Coyote, asks  many questions about the world she has entered:  "I don't understand why you aU look Uke  people," she said.  "We are people."  "I mean, people Uke me, humans."  "Resemblance is in the eye," Coyote said.  Gal keeps asking questions untU she begins to make sense of the answers. Then she  can move from one world to the other without losing her perception of either.  "May's Lion" provides a window into the  author's process when she first worked on  Always Coming Home. Le Guin tells the  story twice, first as it "really" happened and  then as it would happen in the Na VaUey  of the book. Writing "May's Lion" solved a  problem for Le Guin; reading it reinforced  my beUef that her people and places have  Uves of their own!  Buffalo Gals is fiUed with many treasures such as these.

[Note: At press time,  Loulan has come and gone.] And whUe I  am not critical of the upcoming event per se  (although I do question who wUl be there—  mostly white, middle class women?), I do  feel suspicious of therapists in general.  Therapy hooks into the field of psychiatry, a field where widespread beliefs in the  emotional sicknesses of women and lesbians  thrive. The language is rampant with scary  terminology: dependency, hysteria, fusion.  Whether it is our legitimate anger or our  abiUty to create intimate and close loving  bonds, we are judged, labeUed and often  times not heard.  Therapy, however, is different. In part, it  is a process of learning and being understood. But who can we tell when our therapist is getting out of hand? When she is asking for hugs after every session and pouts  when she doesn't get one? When our therapist needs more reassurance than we do?  To be fair, there are some exceUent,  compassionate, spirited and inspiring therapists out there. And to be fair, therapy  can be powerful, insightful and growth-  oriented. After aU, who would not benefit from more deeply knowing themselves,  uncovering truths lodged inside from chUd-  hood?  But by and large, therapy remains a  white middle class phenomenon. At a typical $50 per hour session (with some therapists offering sUding scale to 0 whUe others absolutely refuse), therapy is completely  inaccessible to women on welfare, UI,  mother's aUowance, disabiUty and frankly,  anyone not earning over $20,000 a year.  Most women therapists in the Toronto  community are white, middle class, straight  women, which is not to deny the existence  of women of colour, working class, or lesbian therapists, but only to emphasize the  -prevailing majority.  More importantly however, is the underlying assumption in therapy that we aU have  power and control over our Uves, an individualistic and apoUtical approach that disregards the very real existence of class, race  and sexuahty in women's Uves.  I recently had a chUd taken away from  me. I was a co-mother, an agreement made  with my former lover since before the baby's  birth. My former lover was then and still  is now seeing a therapist who did nothing  to challenge her, perhaps actively supported  her action.  A chUd's growth and development were  at stake. To separate a chUd from any extremely significant person in his or her Ufe is  to inflict emotional scars on the chUd. Why  didn't her therapist try to stop it? Were her  chent's "choices" the more significant thing  than a chUd's hfe? And at the beginning  when she first began to talk about taking  him away, we both went to see another therapist. This therapist, as she put it, was not  being paid to see who was right or wrong,  was only being paid to hsten to us, to help  us talk to each other.  When are the lines between humanitarian obligation and professionalism able to  be crossed? It may be fulfilling for a therapist to watch the metamorphosis of a cUent  from a passive and timid individual to an  assertive and empowered woman. But form  aside, when does a therapist have an obligation to the content, to look not just at the  assertiveness but rather at the object of it?  When wUl therapists begin to look beyond their professionalism and see that  their unyielding support of personal empowerment can sometimes have disastrous results?  Lois Fine  Toronto  cc. Rites, Healthsharing  Ill-founded  and contrary  Kinesis:  To the Hon. Claude Richmond,  Minister of Social Services and Housing  The Status of Women Action Group believes that the recent change to the GAIN  rates is UI-founded and contrary to the best  interests of your cUents, of society and of  your own ministry. We urge you to reconsider your options, and to see if you couldn't  achieve your desired results by different  means.  It is totaUy unrealistic to caU a single  mother of one pre-school age chUd 'employable' when the prospects for employment at  anything other than minimum wage, dead  end jobs are dismal. Nor are there anything  hke the number of supported programmes  for upgrading of educational and skiU levels that would be necessary to aUow welfare  recipients to achieve better employment.  Your government is concerned about preserving and protecting the family, but when  it comes to supporting the family comprised  of a single mother and her chUdren, you reduce support by $50 a month and call that  an 'incentive.' This is cruel to people  ready struggling to maintain a reasonable  existence on an unreasonable budget imposed by inadequate GAIN rates in the first  place.  It is not surprising to read of the high levels of employee dissatisfaction, frustration  and burnout within your ministry: these are  the people who have to deal first-hand with  the results of such short-sighted poUcies.  In our office we also must respond to the  needs of women desperate for decent employment, for financial backing to complete  their education, for suitable housing, and  for the means to look after their chUdren.  We see women taking every step possible  to improve their situation, and meeting bureaucratic hostihty and indifference at every point.  This latest cut in the GAIN rates wUl  cause more pain and social disruption than  the additional revenue could possibly be  worth. We hope you wUl rescind the directive and instead take positive steps to get  people off income assistance.  Thank you for your attention and consideration.
