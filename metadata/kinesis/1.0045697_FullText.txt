Second class mall #6426  KINESIS Movement Matters  Art auction  The British Columbia Coalition of the  Disabled (BCCD) would like to extend a  special invitation to women to join us over  the weekend of June 12 - 14th for a fundraising silent auction. The exhibit is at the Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr College of Art  and Design located on Granville Island.  The opening reception on Friday, June  12, from 8 to 10 pm, features the popular women's band, Key Change. The auction continues Saturday from 9 to 5 pm and  draws to a grand finale on Sunday June 14  from 1 to 5 pm. Viewing hours Saturday and  Sunday are from 9 to 5 pm. The Concourse  Gallery is wheelchair accessible.  Over 100 artists have generously donated artwork including video tapes, artists'  books, drawings, paintings, photography,  assemblage and sculpture. Some of the  participating women artists include: Lorna  Mulligan, Sara Diamond, Claudia Burke,  Margot Butler, Carol Moiseiwitsch, Sharyn  Yuen, Laiwan, Jeannie Kamins and many,  many more.  If you enjoy the work of these artists, this  is your opportunity to purchase some art  as well as support the B.C. Coalition of the  Disabled and affiliates such as The Disabled  Women's Network (DAWN).  DAWN lobbies and educates around specific issues which affect and concern disabled  women such as non-traditional work for  women, parenting and reproductive rights  support for disabled mothers' and physical  access to women's facilities, offices and organizations. Recently DAWN and the BCCD  co-sponsored the Disabled Mothers Picnic  held at Stanley Park in mid May.

The video is divided into five parts, each thirty minute segments focussing on a different aspect of the  Canadian experience: 1) Abortion Caravan:  The Early Movement; 2) Access; 3) Quebec 1971-1980; 4) Restraint/Repression; 5)  Morgentaler.  The video concentrates on the women  who have participated in the movement  since its early days and includes interviews with pioneer activists from the fifties  and sixties. The tapes also examine issues  around the availability of abortion with particular emphasis on the experience of working class women. As well, the series looks  at provincial government's increasing use  of legislative measures to erode social and  health services. In the Morgentaler tape, the  problems inherent in the current abortion  movement's concentration on legal strategy  are examined.

Call for papers  The Canadian Journal of Women and  the Law is interested in receiving papers on  women and custody by July, 1987 for a special issue on custody. The journal is a multi-  disciplinary publication which welcomes papers from disciplines such as philosophy, social science, anthropology and history, as  well as, law.  This special issue is an offshoot of a conference on the politics of custody held in  Windsor, Ontario in the summer of 1986.  The participants at the conference agreed  that the move towards joint custody is an  anti-woman backlash that is a direct attack  on women's hard won right to custody of  their children—a right which is central to  redressing the inequality of women.  Contributors interested in submitting papers should direct papers or inquires to Arlene Mayers, 7601 Bathurst Street, Suite  901, Thornhill, Ontario, L4J 4H5.

When I was dragged to solitary confinement with my face cut from a guard's fist, I  was ready to quit fighting back. I smashed  my head several times against the concrete  walls thinking I could knock myself out,  then I wouldn't ever have to acknowledge  where I'm forced to survive. If the courts  and prison guards want my mind as well as  keeping me in this dark corner just make  sure I'll never be able to talk, walk, smell or  see ... Keep me caged like an animal, take  anything you want, you will anyways, but if  you unlock my cage when I feel like a piece  of dirt to sweep away, I swear I'll act like a  raging animal. I'm sure I must be losing my  mind. I feel like giving up and just go along  with the brutality, I won't say a word. But  then I'm angry. The guards treat me like  an object. I wish there was someone to talk  to or even just to look at, all I can see is a  guard's face peering in through a porthole  on the cold solid steel door. Sometimes the  guards will come by and just stare at me  like I'm something that has never been seen  before. I hate those guards, how can they  look like humans and they lock other humans. Now I want to hurt you for hurting  me I want to see dried blood on your faces  and see you whimper like a hurt child in a  dark corner.

"I don't know any other way  to interpret it except as discrimination,'' said IHA consultant  Kathleen Jamieson of the decision to decentralize consultation  and social service funding to the  band level. "If government can  help other women in the world  through organizations like CIDA  (the Canadian International Development Agency) which assists  women in third world countries  then why can't they recognize  that women's groups here need  help? ...  The balance is against  The IHA is trying to finish a  brief on the amended Act due for  submission to a parliamentary review committee by June 28. But,  says Jamieson, meeting the deadline could be a problem since IHA  has already lost a staff member  working on the project due to the  cutbacks.  According to the IHA President Rose Charlie, Indian Affairs  is "continuing its historic policy  of discriminating against  Indian  Charlie, in a letter to Owen Anderson, Regional Director General  for INAC says: "There is no longer  any funding for Indian women's  groups to work on Bill C-31 and  to help re-instated families or to  battle the continuing impact of  the discrimination created by the  Indian Act, although after 116  years of gender-based discriminatory legislation it should be very  evident that the effects are not going to vanish in a year."  The IHA, which received  $35,000 last year—down from  $45,000 in 1985-86—is a non-profit  society representing the interests  of grassroots Indian women in  B.C. A major focus since its inception in 1969 has been to end  gender-based discrimination in the  Indian Act.  Jamieson says the government  used "sleight of hand" to redefine  money going to IHA, then take it  away. As a result, she says, the  organization has little chance of  getting help from other agencies,  since they normally require core  funding to be in place.  The official explanation from  Indian Affairs is that IHA's funding was axed due to budget restrictions, demands from Chiefs  and Indian leaders to decentralize for greater accountability, and  that consultation and social service funding is for "on reserve initiatives."  Jamieson says the government's  increasing disassociation from  those living off the reserve puts Indian women at a particular disadvantage: "Most recent statistics  show more women than men live  off the reserve, which has traditionally been very inhospitable  to women," she said, adding that  IHA provides valuable support to  those having trouble adjusting to  urban life.  "Given the state of provincial  social services and low welfare  rates, people are falling through  the cracks. We try to help them  but really, we are just picking up  the pieces. They are already in  trouble, or have come to the attention of the law and are sent to  us because we have three counsellors."  Many of the women have lost  their children, have drug'and alcohol problems and have resorted to  prostitution says Jamieson, who is  worried that IHA will no longer be  able to help those in need.  She is also concerned about  IHA's ability to continue its work  on Bill C-31—the amended Indian Act. Jamieson says the Act  is loaded with problems in relation  to the status of future generations  of Indian women and is being implemented in "an extremely sexist  way."  Feminists slam  fetus apprehension  by Nancy Pollak  When the British Columbia  Ministry of Social Services decided  in late May to apprehend the fetus of a woman an hour before  it's birth, the range of reproductive and parenting choices in this  province were again narrowed—  dramatically for the unidentified  woman whose child was taken, potentially for all women.  Feminists have reacted with  outrage to this unprecedented legal invasion of a woman's body, interpreting the government's action  as further evidence of its disdain  for women's reproductive freedom.  "We also know that this decision  will make questionable apprehensions, which occur all too often,  easier in the future," said Maggie Thompson of the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective at a  hastily called news conference.  At press time, the ministry  had released few details about  the circumstances surrounding the  extraordinary proceedings. The  mother has confirmed that her  baby was delivered by caesarean  section and was healthy. "They  gave me no reason, they could  have at least waited until I had  a chance to understand what was  happening," she told a Province  reporter. The custody order—and  its legalities—will be reviewed in  family court on June 9th.  Claude Richmond, the minister  responsible, appears fully aware  of the precedent-setting nature of  the decision and how it may impact on women's access to abortion services. As Adrienne Peacock  of the B.C. Coalition for Abortion  Clinics said, "Today we are witnessing the growing restriction of  abortion: Kamloops, Vernon ...  (if) this apprehension order is upheld, women will be on the slippery slope of having their rights  become secondary to the rights of  the fetus."  She also said, "Children in our  schools are hungry, and the government is unwilling to provide  meals ... or childcare or funding  to social services to enable families to stay together, yet the government is willing to apprehend a  fetus."  Susan O'Donnell of the B.C.  Human Rights Coalition warned  that the government is signalling  that "   you (women) will be  rendered an object, a vehicle to  produce a baby that we can apprehend." She added that even  the former superintendent of Family and Child Services has been  quoted as saying this government  is "apprehension-prone."  "The apprehension jurisdiction  of the ministry has been misused in these circumstances," said  Thompson of the Health Collective. In cases of medical emergencies where a person's consent is  withheld or unavailable, Thompson added, medical staff already  have recourse through the courts.  photo by Jan Skeldon  Kinesis celebrated  our sixteenth birthday this May with  a benefit party at  LaQuena.

Performers at the  Court action against pro-lifers  by Donna Macdonald  A West Kootenay feminist organization has launched a libel suit  against the anti-abortion Nelson  Future Life group.  This action followed three Nelson radio broadcasts in mid  March, in which Future Life member Gwen Cavanaugh allegedly accused the former coordinator of  the Nelson Women's Centre, Carol  Beauchamp, of threatening her.  The transcript of the first  broadcast on the Kootenay Broadcasting System (KBS) used the following phrase: "Cavanaugh claims  her life has been threatened by  ... Carol Beauchamp." In the  second and third broadcasts, this  was changed to the allegation that  Beauchamp had threatened Cavanaugh in an unspecified manner.  According to the transcript, Cavanaugh also said that Future Life  members have been receiving letters containing death threats.  "Cavanaugh says there's no  proof yet, but she believes that the  ... threats originate from lesbian  groups in Nelson," said the broadcast. Later in the item, Cavanaugh  asserted that lesbians control the  Nelson Women's Centre, implying  that the death threats originated  from the centre.  Beauchamp calls these allegations slimy tactics. "There hasn't  ever been any threat of any sort,"  she says. "Cavanagh's actions simply came from a malicious intent  to hurt. And we're tired of being  used by Future Life to get publicity."  Beauchamp and the West  Kootenay Women's Association,  which is the sponsoring body for  the Women's Centre, believed the  charges made by Cavanaugh merited a legal response, so a libel action was launched against her and  Future Life.  Also named in the libel action  are the KBS and the two announcers involved in the news item. According to reporter Kevin Cutler  who prepared the item, it originated when Cavanaugh phoned  the radio station, saying she had  an important news item. She then  proceeded to give information to  Cutler who, thinking he had a hot  story, wrote up the report and  broadcast it fifteen minutes later.  According to Cutler, Cavanaugh  phoned after the first broadcast to  ask for a change from death threat  to unspecified threat. She again  phoned after the second broadcast  and this time, he says, she approved the item.  However, in late April, a paid  ad appeared in the Nelson Daily  News claiming that "the broadcast  statements were completely in error and did not reflect in any way  Mrs. Cavanaugh's own statement  to the KBS."  So where lies the truth? Presumably on the tape recording  that was made of the original conversation between Cavanaugh and  the reporter. Thus far the women's  association lawyer has been unable  to gain access to this tape.  Beauchamp speculates that Cavanaugh's action resulted from an  incident in early March. The Future Life group had set up an anti-  abortion kiosk in downtown Nelson which was postered by unknown persons. The posters were  about concerns such as poverty,  disabled and elderly people, and  peace. One poster accused the Future Life group of only focusing on  abortion and not on genuine pro-  life issues. Future Life members  were outraged by these posters, especially one that mentioned lesbian rights.  Letters have now been sent to  the defendants in the libel suit,  requesting public apologies and,  for Beauchamp, financial compensation for the suffering and damage caused to her.  KINESIS  '87 June Across B.C  X\XXXXXXNV\\XVX\XXN\NXXNXXXXXXXX^^^  Regressive bills  threaten BC labour  by Jane MacEwan and Lisa  Pedrini  Bilk 19 and 20 are regressive  pieces of legislation formulated for  the sole purpose of destroying the  B.C. Teachers Federation (BCTF)  and crippling the labour movement. Women in education have  more to lose than ever. If passed,  these bills will result in unprecedented government control of the  public and private sectors as well  as education. While Bill 19 limits  bargaining rights, Bill 20 destroys  professional autonomy and totally  disrupts the Status of Women program.  The government justifies Bill 19  by arguing that the legislation will  create a model which will "ensure that the public interest is protected at all times in the event  of labour conflict, whether it be a  public or private sector dispute."  With Bill 20, the government implies that it is giving teachers everything they asked for, specifically:  • full bargaining rights  • the primacy of the Local Association in bargaining  • the phase out of the Compensation Stabilization Program  • professional control over members  The government also wants us  to believe that this legislation has  been formulated to protect the  public interest. Nothing could be  further from the truth. This legislation has only one catch word and  that word is control. Government  control of employees' rights and,  even more frightening, government  control of the education system.  Under Bill 20, teachers will now  be able to choose between joining a  union and an association with the  union having full collective bargaining rights. However, under Bill  19, bargaining rights have been  eroded to the point that teachers  have little to gain.  For example, although the Compensation Stabilization Program is  being phased out, "the ability of  the public sector employer to pay  shall be the paramount factor"  (137.96). This section all but destroys the arbitration process and  adds extraordinary support to employer demands.  In addition, all arbitrated settlements are subject to the review  and approval of the Industrial Relations Council under the direction  of the commissioner. The commissioner may direct the arbitration  board to "reconsider and redetermine its award." No appeal lies in  the decision of the commissioner  (137.96).  Supposedly, teachers, under the  proposed Industrial Relations Act,  will have the right to strike. However, should the strike be ruled  not in the public interest, the commissioner may order that "every  employee shall resume the duties  of his employment with his employer" (137.9). This section of the  Act undermines the right to withdraw services.  Bill 20 attempts to separate the  teachers' professional responsibilities from their bargaining responsibilities. The government's fantasy is that teachers will welcome  this separation and will be glad  to have the proposed College of  Teachers assume the professional  responsibilities which have been  carried out by the B.C.T.F.  The establishment of the College of Teachers is an effort to sub  vert the power of the BCTF. In  the government's view, the BCTF  is a dictatorial organization which  operates by keeping its members  in fear. The government wants the  public to believe the College will  provide a balance, giving teachers  the 'democratic' control of their  profession. Recent events, however, have demonstrated clearly  that support for the BCTF has seldom been stronger.  An examination of the College's  structure in comparison to that  of the BCTF is informative. On  the one hand, we have the College of Teachers which will be governed by a council; the council will  have the power to set the fees,  as well as the by-laws and regulations of the College. There will  be twenty members on the council: four appointed by the government, one appointed by the government from the faculties of education, and fifteen elected from  the members of the college. Quorum will be five. Under the guidelines set out for the College, it  must hold an annual general meeting. However, the AGM has no decision making powers and is permitted to provide only advice and  guidance to the council.  On the other hand, we have the  BCTF. The BCTF's most powerful decision making body is its 650  delegate annual general meeting.  Each AGM delegate is elected by  the members of local teacher's associations. The delegates meet to  establish the fees and set the policy of the federation.  An interesting contrast isn't it?  —twenty members of the "democratic" college (five of which are  not elected) with similar powers  to the 650 elected delegates of the  "undemocratic" BCTF.  Stop Bill 19,  Bill 20, and  Bill Vander Zalm.  What the government is really trying to do with the College of Teachers is to destroy the  BCTF's influence over professional  and curriculum development. The  government claims that no other  teaching group in Canada will  have more control over its profession than the teachers of B.C.  with the passing of Bill 20. But  as you can see by the structure of  the College, it guarantees government control of the profession, not  teacher control.  In addition, school boards may  terminate a teacher's contract by  giving thirty days notice and fire  teachers on the grounds of "unprofessional conduct." This section of the act effectively muzzles  teachers as advocates for education. It gives the government and  the school boards the power to  conduct 'witch hunts' within the  profession. A teacher arguing for  smaller class sizes or establishing  innovative programs could be determined "unprofessional."  As well, principals and vice-  principals will become administrative officers with no collective bargaining rights. They are placed  clearly into a management role,  separated from their colleagues in  the local association or union, left  Daycare advocates plan new strategies  by Claire Stannard  Over ninety people from all over  British Columbia participated in  the Child Care Advocacy Training  Institute at the YWCA in early  May. The institute was jointly  sponsored by the B.C. Day Care  Action Coalition (BCDCAC) and  the Canadian Day Care Advocacy  Association (CDCAA).  The program began Friday  evening at the Hotel Vancouver  with a panel discussion between  three members of the Special Committee on Child Care whose report came out in March. Two  of the panel members, Margaret  Mitchell, (NDP) and Lucie Pepin,  (Liberal) issued dissenting minority reports for their parties.  This left Ross Belsher, (PC) to  defend his party's proposals for a  national child care program. The  Tory position's unpopularity was  shown by the 250 member audience when the floor was opened to  questions. A dozen spokespeople,  supported by audience applause,  * KINESIS  expressed their unhappiness with  the Committee Report. Specifically, many objected to recommendations which called for over half  the proposed funding to go towards tax credits to parents instead of directly to the creation  and operation of non-profit child  care.  The rest of the weekend consisted of informative presentations  and a variety of workshops, designed to build skills in the area of  child care advocacy.  There was an overview of how  day care is affected at the local,  provincial and federal levels, reports from different areas of B.C.  on the state of child care services  in their regions, and a response  from representatives of provincial  parties including Darlene Marzari,  NDP MLA for Point Grey, and  Gordon Wilson, Liberal leadership  candidate from Sechelt.  Social Credit MLA Russ Fraser  backed out of his promise to address the conference.  Socred views on day care were  aired through reported statements  made by Vander Zalm and by  Claude Richmond, the minister  who will be negotiating for B.C. in  June when the provinces meet in  Ottawa to draw up an agreement  on child care.  Vander Zalm has said that child  care is not a provincial responsibility, while Richmond promotes  the idea of private centres, accusing non-profit directors of earning up to $60 to $80 thousand  annually. The participants, many  poorly paid day care supervisors,  laughed in amazement at this  point.  Constitution A Concern  Many people over the weekend expressed worries about the  joint federal-provincial constitutional accord negotiated at Meech  Lake in late April. The agreement  allows the provinces to opt-out of  shared cost programs while guaranteeing "reasonable compensation" provided the provinces have  a corresponding program "compatible with national objectives".  Day care advocates are concerned that this provision will  threaten an agreement on a national child care program.  "We don't know what 'national  objectives' means yet," says Bill  Black, a University of British Columbia law professor and constitutional expert. "Could B.C. get  away with a watered-down version  of the federal program while collecting federal funds?"  "Given the B.C. government's  position on day care," says Penny  Coates, B.C. rep for the CDCAA,  "it's a real fear that they could  opt-out altogether and we'd be left  with nothing."  She goes on to say, "If everyone  from the institute rallied support  for day care in their communities  and wrote letters to Claude Richmond and gathered signatures on  the petition we're circulating, then  I think we have a chance."  to negotiate their contracts as individuals, and required to work  in a hierarchical way as managers  rather than within the BCTF col-  legial model of shared educational  leadership. The school system will  become increasingly hierarchical  and less democratic.  The government wants to destroy the BCTF's influence over  professional and curriculum development. Under Bill 20, the College's responsibilities are to "cooperate in and facilitate programs  of professional development whose  objects are to improve the quality of educational services," to design and evaluate teacher education programs, and to provide advice on curricula (26). Presently  the BCTF carries many of these  responsibilities. In future, directions in education will be controlled by the council of the college.  Bill 20 also restricts the scope of  the teacher's contract. Section 72  of Bill 20 states:  "There shall not (emphasis  added) be included in an agreement between a board and an association any provision  (a) regulating the selection  and appointment of teachers, the  courses of study, the program of  studies, or the professional methods and techniques employed by a  teacher ..."  Presently, these clauses include  plans for recruiting, hiring and  promoting staff to redress identified gender inequalities, specific  programs to enable women to pursue administrative positions, and  the establishment of specific goals  and timetables for equalizing distribution of male and female teachers. Under Bill 20, BCTF policy  regarding negotiation of affirmative action programs will remain  just that—BCTF policy.  Women will no longer be so  attracted to teaching. Threats of  transfers and dismissals will make  it increasingly difficult for women  teachers to speak out on issues of  equality, to organize to improve  conditions for their female students, or to be themselves, effective role models for their students.  Taken together, Bills 19 and 20  are an unprecedented assault on  the province's teachers. They must  be defeated.  Jane MacEwan and Lisa  Pedrini are members of the  British Columbia Teacher's  Federation and are active on  the BCTF's Status of Women  committee. ACROSS  B.C.  Council approves major budget cuts  On Tuesday, May 26th, at the one  and only Vancouver City Council hearing on its proposed £5 million in budget cuts, seventy-two delegations of concerned citizens, as well as community,  recreation and labour organizations repeatedly warned council not to make  any budget cuts.  Both the upper and lower council  chambers were crammed so full that an  overflow crowd was seated in a committee room in front of a TV monitor  showing the proceedings. Each speaker  was articulate and well informed. The  overwhelming feeling of "No, to the cut-  backs"and the resentment about the lack  of any real public consultation and input was intense.  ■ The special meeting finally adjourned  at 8:10 a.m. and despite the pleas from  Vancouver citizens, the Non Partisan  Association (NPA) dominated council voted nine to two in favor of the  budget cuts. The Committee of Progressive Electors' (COPE) Aldermen,  Libby Davies and Bruce Erickson voted  against every one of the proposed cuts.  The only place the NPA broke ranks was  on the vote to reduce city fire services  which passed by a seven to four majority, with Aldermen Bellamy and Baker  joining the two COPE aldermen in voting against the cut.

But this expenditure could  be financed without cutting other departments, through more PEF transfers, use of  the contingency fund (Council's rainy day  account) or even a plebiscite.

This budgeting process, as slated in the Council report  (April 3, 1987),  is quite possibly Council's most important decision making process. It determines what services the City will deliver to the citizens of Vancouver during the year.  Each year there has been less money from  revenues than is needed to meet expenses.  This year's shortfall was $18 million. Under  the previous Harcourt administration, income from the Property Endowment Fund  (PEF) was used along with property taxes  to make up the shortfall.  The PEF consists of over $500 million  worth of land and properties owned by the  city. It has been the cushion for budget  shortfalls over the past six years. In past  years, NPA has voted against using PEF income to cover shortfalls.  This year a second budget review process has been occurring but not in concert with the set 1987 operating budget.

The Grim Picture  KINESIS  '87 June SSSSSSS\  Across B.C.  Domestic workers challenge the constitution  by Noreen Howes  The recently formed Domestic Workers  Association (DWA), based in Vancouver,  is challenging the Canadian Constitution,  charging sexual discrimination of British  Columbia's 5,000 domestic workers. The association, together with the Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) is demanding overtime pay for domestic workers.  Domestic workers and farmworkers are  excluded from the hourly minimum and  overtime provisions guaranteed other workers by B.C.'s Employment Standards Act.  Instead, the women earn a $32 daily rate,  regardless of the hours worked. According  to Kyong Ae of DWA an average working  day for a domestic worker in a private residence is twelve to fourteen hours, beginning  early in the morning and often not ending  until well after the children are put to bed.  "No nannies work only eight hours", said  Dominique, who is employed by a Vancouver single father of three. "I work fifty  hours plus I'm expected to do evening  babysitting."  The live-in nature of the domestic work  as well as the general devaluing of women's  work in the home add to this exploitation.  According to LEAF the fact that virtually all domestic workers are women means  the denial of overtime pay to them is discriminatory under the equality provision of  the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Only  recently has a domestic worker been willing to come forward—possibly at a risk to  both her job and her status in Canada—to  be a test case in LEAF's Charter challenge.  If the LEAF challenge succeeds, all domestic workers will have the same right to overtime pay as other B.C. workers.  Organizing domestic workers is a difficult  process, says Kyong Ae. First there's the  woman's isolation in the home, and then  her demanding work schedule. Many women  have only one free afternoon a week and understandably would prefer not to spend it  at a meeting. Also, the young association  (it was formed in April) hasn't yet seriously  sought members; a "big push" is expected  in the months ahead. Presently the twenty  or so domestics in the DWA, mostly European 'nannies', meet monthly to talk about  their jobs, learn their rights and generally  provide support and friendship.  "Most women just want to talk about  work problems", says Kyong Ae. "They're  angry and can't believe what's happening  to them, how unfair it is ... ". She added  that the objective of the Association is to be  "a political lobbying tool and educational  group, not an encounter session."  icy benefits both government and employers  because it provides a steady supply of workers ... who will accept whatever wages and  working conditions they are offered, and  who need not be provided with the benefits  that accompany landed immigrant status.  Every move these workers make must  first be approved through the department  of immigration, and it costs them. For many  women, the financial penalty begins in their  home country, with the nanny agency.  «  0&&>  STITCHCD  fmwcBannehs  MADE   TO ORDER,  ■o-nu sizje-reosortoite, rates-barter  considered- £[.£abeth 73*H3?5  The DWA is preparing a booklet on domestic worker's rights, which they hope to  give every woman entering Canada as a domestic. "We'd like to stock the immigration  offices with these books", she said.  Filipino domestic workers, who form the  majority of domestic workers in B.C., are  hesitant to become involved in DWA because they have more at risk. Unlike the European women—many of whom are younger  and come to Canada primarily to learn English and have an adventure—these women  leave the Philippines to escape poverty.  Their Canadian wages often feed families  back home, and they are less likely to risk either a job or a chance to remain in Canada,  by actively fighting poverty here.  Domestic workers are brought into Canada to do the work Canadians refuse. The  workers are issued a temporary employment  visa which ties them to specific job categories and employers. Over the past five  years the Canadian government has been  substantially increasing the number of people entering the country on temporary visas  and decreasing the numbers of landed immigrants.  "Clearly the government is favouring employment visas over landed immigrant status", writes Rachel Epstein, an advocate for  domestic workers. She argues that the pol-  "I had paid $300 to the agency to get me  a job in Vancouver", explained one woman,  "but when I arrived, the agency told me  that the family ... had cancelled me." She  added that the Swiss agency painted an  idyllic picture of Canada, of the work and  of the employer which left her unprepared  for the six children and two adults she was  soon tending—for what amounted to less  than five dollars per child per day.  Once a woman is placed with a family,  a contract outlining wages, working conditions and deductions, is signed by immigration, her employer and the worker. The contract, however, is not legally binding nor is  it monitored by immigration. Employers are  free to interpret it as they wish, in the privacy of their own homes.  Some add to the woman's job description,  or cut her wages. To others, the room and  board deduction seems a bit low, once she's  actually living in the home. In some cases  the domestic is forced to share a child's  room or she is denied visitor and phone  rights.  Her life is tremendously manipulated by  a virtual stranger, her Canadian employer,  and it is only with great difficulty and expense that she can buy her way out of the  situation. But only until immigration passes  the pen to the next buyer.  Living with her employer also increases  the possibility of sexual harassment. One  woman recalls her employer insisting she  join him in his viewing of pornography; he  was often at home, alone with her, in the  afternoons.  But changing employers is possible, after  all—these women aren't slaves. To change  employers all a worker needs to do is:  • get her employer's permission to quit  • get the immigration officer's permission  to quit  • find a new employer  • go with her new employer to a Canada  Employment Centre to draw up a new  contract  • return to immigration to have the contract approved  • pay $50 for the privilege of quitting (to  have a new work visa issued)  Simple. Straightforward. Maybe only  taking a few days out of her life, four or  five bus tickets, and about a week's pay. But  what happens if she speaks neither English  nor French? Or if she doesn't know about  this process? Or if her employer refuses to  let her leave? Or decides to withhold back  wages? Or lies about her to immigration?  What if immigration arbitrarily decides not  to grant her permission to change jobs?  What if she doesn't have $50?  Even if she is ultimately able to change  employers, the chances of it being a mark  against her—perhaps to haunt her in future  immigration hearings—are great. The hidden moral being: One must not fight; one  must not quit the employ of a respectable  Canadian family ...  There are other less hidden messages on  the part of the Canadian government:  Unemployment insurance and Canada  Pension Plan contributions are deducted  from domestics, although the women are  virtually never able to claim UI or receive pensions. Her work visa depends upon  constant employment, and few domestic  workers are allowed to remain in Canada  long enough to draw their pension. Rachel  Epstein's research estimates that Revenue  Canada takes in almost $2 million each year  from UIC and CPP premiums paid by domestics and their employers.  After extensive lobbying by domestic  workers across the country, landed status  can now be applied for from within Canada,  after a domestic worker has been working  here for two years. But each application  costs her $150 and requires proof of her  "self-sufficiency".  Self-sufficiency, according to immigration, means a liveable income—which as a  domestic worker she is rarely paid. It's also  more difficult to prove self-sufficiency if she  is supporting children back home, which is  often the case.  Beginning with the present fight for overtime pay, there are many battles to be  fought by domestic workers in this province.  The greatest battle, however, is against  Canada's insidious racism, through which  women of colour are 'imported' to Canada  from Third World countries, then stripped  of their rights by government policies which  ensure their exploitation by white employ-  Program y°ur  deliveries and  save a bundle!  683-1610  683-2696  1501 -925 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C.

And will she  get any support from the Canadian courts?  These are just two of the questions raised  by the trial of Ontario lesbian mother Gayle  Bezaire, which got underway at the end of  May.  Bezaire faces a maximum of fifty years in  prison on one count of harboring and four  counts of abduction. All the changes are related to her attempts to protect her two  children from their father George Bezaire.  Gayle says both she and her children were  sexually abused and physically assaulted  while living with George. She herself was  forced to act as a prostitute for his friends  and perform in porn films he produced.  George was twice convicted of aggravated  assault against her.  According to Gayle, the children, a girl  and boy, were also frequently sexually  abused, and on at least one occasion Gayle's  son was beaten with the buckle end of a belt.  In 1980 Gayle finally decided, as she says  "that I wouldn't be an accomplice in the  For these reasons, the trial is a significant and precedent- setting one for Canadian women, regardless of their sexuality.  Apparently a mother's right to protect her  children and herself is less important to the  authorities than her lifestyle.  The trial is important for other reasons  as well. For one thing, the legal history of  the case raises a host of child custody and  battering issues.  Gayle was married at the age of eighteen,  when she was three months pregnant with  her daughter. When her daughter was six  months old, she discovered she was pregnant again. Her husband told her she had  to have an abortion, and when she refused,  he beat her for the first time. She left him  then, but was forced to return because she  had nowhere else to go.  The abuse worsened after her son was  born, and finally Gayle laid a complaint  of aggravated assault against George. Before the case came to trial, he assaulted  her again, resulting in hospitalization, and  again on her return from the hospital. She  charged him. He was convicted on both  charges, and fined $50 for each one.  It appears that the charges, and the fact that the  prosecution is going for a maximum sentence,  are linked to Gayle's lesbianism.  abuse of my children anymore." In November of that year she was charged with abduction. In December of 1985 she surrendered to the police in Windsor, Ontario.  Gayle is the first woman in Canada to  be charged with abduction in a case like  this. And in a recent case involving a father who took his two children away from  their mother to Australia for four and a half  years, the sentence was only four months  probation.  It appears that the charges, and the fact  that the prosecution is going for a maximum  sentence, are linked to Gayle's lesbianism.  Gayle then applied for and won interim  custody of the children, and George was ordered to pay child support. He was given  reasonable access to the children, but rarely  paid the support, and often didn't return  the children on time.  A year after Gayle left George, she came  out of the closet, and eventually her husband found out she was a lesbian and filed  for divorce and custody. Gayle became the  first open Canadian lesbian to fight for custody of her children in court.  She won conditional custody. The conditions were that she not have a lover, and  that anyone who she lived with be approved  by the courts. She was told that the reason  she had been granted custody was the fact  that she had instilled in the children "love  and respect for their father."  Gayle set about appealing the custody  conditions while George appealed the custody award.  At the next court appearance, to settle  property from the marriage, it came out  that Gayle was hving with a woman who  was her lover. She was given one hour to tell  her children that they were to go live with  their father.  "I think that was one of the two most horrible times of my life," she says now. "My  kids literally were torn from me screaming.  They did not want to be with their father."  The appeal of that decision took seventeen months to reach the courts. In  the meantime Gayle applied for an official guardian for the children, which was  granted, and for a psychiatric family evaluation, which was also granted.  The psychiatrist found that George  Bezaire was an extremely violent man who  showed no warmth or tenderness towards  his children or his common law wife. She  said that the children showed not some but  all the symptoms of child abuse, and recommended that the children be returned to  Gayle immediately.  Despite this and other evidence, Gayle  lost the appeal. Of the three judges, one  found that he "could not see how two children raised in a homosexual home could  grow to be healthy normal contributing citizens of our society." Another judge agreed,  and the third, now Supreme Court justice  Bertha Wilson, dissented.  Having little hope of finding justice in the  court system, Gayle contacted Children's  Aid for their help. She found that their  method of investigation was to ask the children in front of their father whether he ever  abused them. When Gayle called the chil-,  dren's schools to ask for their assistance  they told her they never wanted to speak to  a lesbian mother again.  Peltier-Mandela tour links indigenous people  Rigoberta Menchu of Guatamala and Nilak Butler of the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee were two of several speakers at  an evening of solidarity with South African and Native American political prisoners, May 14 in Vancouver. An audience of  300 jammed the Ukranian Hall to hear speakers from South Africa, Central American and Native North Americans demand  justice for Native American political prisoner Leonard Peltier and African national Congress leader Nelson Mandela, The  message of the evening was one of hope and empowerment in the midst of a continuing struggle against injustice.  At this point, says Gayle, "There was  nothing else I could do, there was nowhere  else I could go. My only hope was that  could somehow build a relationship with my  kids. And I felt like an animal sending them  back to their father."  During this time, George effectively refused Gayle access to the children. She says  that when she arrived at the appointed time  to pick them up for their visits, she would  be told they were not at home, though I  sometimes she says she could hear them  calling from the basement. This continued  for two months, September and October of  1980. Finally, she says, she came at an un  appointed time, and managed to see the  children. When they got to her house on  their visit, she discovered that her daugh  ter's vagina was inflamed from penetration.  "I can't even begin to tell you what it was  like," says Gayle, "seeing with my own two  eyes the damage that was done to her body  by her father."  The children talked, and decided tha;  they wouldn't go back to their father, an<  in November, Gayle was charged with chile.  abduction.  In 1985 Gayle's daughter decided to return to her father, precipitating Gayle's sur  render to the Windsor police in December  of that year. Gayle's son refused to surren  der and go live with his father, but bowed to  pressure from the crown attorney, who told  him his mother would remain in jail until he  did so.  Since being released on bail, Gayle says  she has been assaulted by men she is convinced were hired by her husband (police  said her wounds were self-inflicted), and re-f  ceives constant death threats.  The trial itself began on May 28, in Toronto courts. A change of venue from Wind  sor was granted on the basis of extremely  sensationalist media coverage there. George  Bezaire's family is prominent and influential  in Windsor, and he has successfully created  an image for himself of a victimized father.  He is a member of groups called Fathers  For Equal Rights.  Gayle feels she has a good chance of being  acquitted, though she is presently preparing  herself emotionally to go to jail. Under the  Criminal Code, she says, a parent cannot:  be found guilty of child abduction if they  remove children from the custodial parent  if they can prove they removed the children  because they feared they were in imminent  danger or harm. As far as Gayle knows, it  is a defense that has never been used, mak  ing her case the first of its kind in Canadian  courts.  To back up her case, Gayle will be  bringing in expert witnesses from the feminist community: Phyllis Chesler, Catherine  McKinnon, Kathleen Leahy, and Paula Kaplan were all tentatively confirmed at press  time.  If Gayle is found guilty, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) wil  take the appeal to higher court.  .I Support for Gayle is essential.

KINESIS 37 June Across Canada  What is black feminism?'  by Noga Gayle  The Congress of Black Women  of Canada held its fourth biennial conference in mid-May in  Vancouver. The event was hosted  by the Vancouver chapter of the  Congress. The objective of the  Congress is to provide a network  of solidarity for black women in  Canada, and to be a united voice  in the defence and extension of human rights and liberties for black  women. To foster a climate in  which it is acceptable for black  women to examine openly the issues which affect them. To plan  and implement a programme of education for black women.  The aim of the Conference is  in keeping with these objectives  by bringing all the groups together to discuss the major issues  of concern to black women. In between conferences committees are  appointed by the National Council  on a regular basis to examine issues of national importance, make  recommendations and implement  actions. Apart from this all chapters are autonomous in their interaction with their own communities.  The workshops reflected many  of these issues.  • The workshop on employment-  unemployment discussed the  implementation of retraining  for the employment of black  women.  • free trade and its implication for  black women  • employment equity and the  black woman and  • unemployment and the black  woman  The panelists focused on the importance of having updated information on these issues and access  to government services.  The health workshop focused on  the issues that impact on black  women. Ideas from this workshop  focused on the need for black  women to develop an awareness in  terms of coping with mental health  issues, in particular stress. There  needs to be documentation of cultural variables in understanding  the nuances of the various cultures  that sometimes can be misunderstood as mental health problems.  New bill confuses pornography, erotica  The   federal   government   has  ce again raised a hue and cry  with its efforts to create new laws  regulating pornography.  The new pornography bill,  tabled by Justice Minister Ramon  Hnatyshyn in early May, calls for  ten year jail sentences for pornography which visually depicts sexual acts involving children or serious sexual violence against anyone.  However, in a move that has  outraged feminists, civil libertarians and artists the new bill also  would define depictions of intercourse between consenting adults  as pornographic.  According to Hnatyshyn the  new bill will strike a balance between the necessity to protect people and the right to freedom of expression.  The porn bill was re-introduced  after a national controversy was  generated by former Justice Minister's John Crosbie's porn bill  which proposed a definition of pornography that would have made  depictions of virtually any type of  sexual activity illegal.  Hnatyshyn acknowledged that  the intent of his bill is the same as  the Crosbie bill: to protect women  and children from sexual exploitation.  The new bill would define for  the first time what constitutes  erotica, which is essentially defined  as nudity. The proposed definition of pornography includes sexually violent conduct, bestiality,  masturbation, and vaginal, anal or  oral intercourse. It also covers any  "matter or commercial communication that incites, promotes or  advocates" any conduct deemed  to be pornographic. The new bill  would outlaw written advertisements or telephone services that  offer sexual messages to callers.  According to Louise Dulude,  President of the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC), "They (the federal government) consider pornographic what we consider erotic."  Dulude said that NAC will press  for changes so that sexual intercourse be included in the definition  of erotica.  Artists across Canada are universally opposed to the bill. Jane  Buss of the Playwrights Union of  Canada says "The government is  using a hammer for a problem that  requires a scalpel."  Michelle D'Auray, national director of the Canadian Conference  of the Arts, says that while the  bill contains important changes  (from Crosbie's bill) her organization "still has fundamental difficulties" with the legislation particularly the insistence that any depiction of anyone under the age of 18  engaging in sexual activity (even if  played by someone older than 18)  is considered obscene , without the  defense of artistic merit.  Artists are particularly concerned that under the section of  the bill that allows for a defense  of artistic merit against charges of  pornography the onus would be on  the accused to prove that she has  not exploited her subject matter.  The practical concern is that  new artists, particularly those who  explore the nature of sexuality, are  at risk of prosecution.  Many commentators have suggested that the proposed bill is  vulnerable to several arguments  under the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.  Locally the Vancouver Artists  League and the Coalition for  the Right to View, both of  which are strongly opposed to  the proposed porn legislation,  are holding a series of events to  challenge the legislation.  On June 6th a screening of  Double Jeapardy by Carol Allen  and Richard Fung will take  place at 1 pm at the Western Front, SOS East 8th Ave.,  Vancouver. The video deals  with sexual imagery of different races and a discussion period will follow.  On the weekend of June  26 to 28 a workshop series  and video screenings will take  place at Vancouver's Video  Inn, 1160 Hamilton. As part  of the weekend's events the  Canadian premiere of Playing With Fire, will be screened.  Power struggle R.E.AJL. trouble  by Kinesis Staff Writer  According to reports in the  Globe and Mail, Realistic, Equal  and Active for Life (R.E.A.L.)  Women is embroiled in a serious  power struggle.  Past president Gwen Landolt  has apparently tried to manoeuver  herself back onto the national executive, in effect steamrolling over  the elected three member executive. The Globe article quotes an  unidentified R.E.A.L. source who  also said that Lettie Morse, apparently a Landolt supporter, had  made a motion at a recent executive meeting to disband the current executive. The motion was  passed, the source said, but the executive agreed to stay on until a  transition could be made.  The president of R.E.A.L.,  Lynn Scime of Hamilton, confirmed that a motion to disband  the executive was made, but she  said it was later withdrawn. Scime  told the Globe that, "As of this  moment," she was still president.  Landolt told the Globe that  she was serving as executive vice-  president and said that she and  Morse were added to the administrative rooster because the  three member executive was overworked.  Susan Rogerson, another member of the R.E.A.L. Women board,  when told Landolt had identified  herself as executive vice-president,  said that Landolt "Is not authorized to speak on behalf of the executive. She can call herself the  King of Siam if she wants."  Meanwhile a chapter of  R.E.A.L., based in Saskatoon,  has been ejected from the national  association. The Saskatoon chapter, according to president, Gay  Caswell, had not received any indication of what it had done wrong.  Caswell said the situation has  left women in the west concerned  that a central Canadian clique is  trying to control the organization.  "The leaders should speak for  the majority, she said. If the majority elect an executive, they  should respect that." Caswell also  said she was concerned about how  events would reflect on R.E.A.L.'s  efforts to gain funds through the  Secretary of State.  Caswell said she and other  Saskatoon women intend to set up  their own organization called Victorious Women of Canada.  It was recommended that women  should demand two to three medical opinions when diagnosed just  to ensure that health issues peculiar to blacks may be recognized.  On the issue of violence the  matter was dealt with in the  general terms of violence against  women. This included mental and  physical violence. It was felt that  women should not be silent on  this matter and it is necessary  to be conscious of the fact that  no woman has to accept violence  against her. It was emphasized  that black women should support  each other socially and psychologically.  The panel discussion focused on  "Racism, Sexism and Black Feminism." It was strongly felt that  black women should make feminism a part of their lives. It must  be rooted in their history as black  women and how they are situated  within the North American political economy.  On the issue of black feminism  the question was asked, "What is  black feminism?" Many answers  were discussed but there was no  definitive answer. It was emphasized that black women needed to  go beyond mainstream perceptions  and examine their lives, past and  present, and their contributions to  society. It was concluded that this  dialogue needed to be continued.  There was a request that the various chapters should get together  and return to a forum.  A highlight of the conference was the luncheon speaker:  Thato Bereng who discussed black  women under apartheid. Her talk  was in keeping with the objective of the Congress in the sense  that we were asked to support  black women globally. She also offered us an alternative way in looking at apartheid, not as something  unique to South Africa and alien to  us but that apartheid can be found  everywhere black people exist.  The keynote speaker at dinner was Michele Wallace, author  of "Black Macho and the Myth  of the Super Woman". She emphasized that literature should be  used to illustrate the black perspective since most ideas are generated by reading. In discussing  this she made reference to several  black female writers such as Zora  Neale Hurston, Alice Walker and  Toni Cade- Bambara.  She pointed out that minorities  tended to be invisible and this is  even more so of black female writers. One reason for this invisibility is that the dominant culture incorporates the emergent and suppresses it. She also pointed out  that we live in a patriarchal, white,  racist, capitalist society and by doing our everyday activities without critical thinking of these activities we consent to our own oppression. She stressed the importance of political analysis through  dialogue and discourse.  The Congress' national president responded to the speech by  praising Wallace for the courageous steps she has taken in challenging the black bourgeoisie.  The conference created a sense  of solidarity among the women and  speaker after speaker emphasized  the hope that such solidarity in sisterhood would continue.  «KINESIS S/SS/SS/////S////S/SS/S///S////S///S/S//S///S///S/////S///////////////SS///////S//S//SSS//////////  //////////////////^^^^^^  /////////////////////^^^^^  International  by Maura Volante  Zohl de Ishtar and Bridget Roberts, both  active with the Greenham Common Peace  Camp, got involved with bringing the issues  of nuclear testing and militarization of the  Pacific to Britain in 1983, when de Ishtar,  an Australian, discovered that the plight of  the Pacific Islands people was not known to  the white peace movement of Britain.  "There are two forces rising up on the  planet at the moment. One of these is the  women's movement and the other is indigenous people's movements. These are the two  cultures that come from the land," said de  Ishtar, during a Vancouver speaking tour  last month. She and Roberts were on their  way back to Britain from a tour of the Pacific Islands. De Ishtar went on to assert  that "these two cultures are going to save o  the planet. And the link between these two _£  cultures is formed by indigenous women."     °-  In 1983 de Ishtar told Greenham women  some of the stories of nuclear testing in the  Pacific and its consequences, and found that  "Women were hearing it in their hearts. It  was shocking news for most of them, because they hadn't heard it before. The testing program proves that the nuclear war we  fear as something in the future has been going on for forty years, and people, particularly women, are suffering drastically from  it today."  As a result of de Ishtar's work Greenham  women started an initiative called "Women  Working for a Nuclear-Free and Independent Pacific" and began raising money  to bring indigenous women from the Pacific to tell their stories directly. Titewhai  Harawira, a Maori woman, and Chailang  Palacios, a Chomorro woman from the  Northern Marianas, were the first to come  to Britain, bringing not only their personal  stories but also clear statements on colonialism and racism, which formed the basis of  the network.  One positive outcome of the network's  efforts has been a moratorium on nuclear  waste dumping in the oceans of the world  until it can be proved safe. This was passed  at the London Dumping Convention after presentations by two Chomorro women  brought there by the Greenham group.  "The next action," said de Ishtar, "was  a week-long commemoration of Bikini Atoll  Bridget Roberts and Zohl de Ishtar  Stop nuking the  South Pacific  Day (March 1), in 1986.

"Two women, one from Rongelap and  another from Belau, (both Pacific Islands)  spoke in Britain and that built up a lot of  interest, because we were hearing the story  from indigenous women themselves. Today  we've got hundreds of women in Britain  working on the issues of the Pacific. We have  started to change the attitude of the peace  movement in Britain, getting it away from  being so Eurocentric.  CC\J_             <^ZS       »MTM             5©K.K.6AT.

Charlie said  IHA's work should stand on its own merits.  Alan Jay, Regional Director of Communications for INAC, told Kinesis that if the  IHA is concerned about discrimination on  the part of band leaders they should work  to change the system.  "They (the band leaders) are the ones  committed enough to work for what they  want. If women want to change (the system)  they can do the same," said Jay. He also said  not all Indian men discriminate and that in  fact, there is a "long history" of Indian men  providing assistance to Indian women.  Jay also dismissed the accusation that  INAC is discriminating against Indian  women, saying that IHA's funding was  ended because of the need to set priorities  in leaner times, not because it is a women's  group.  "Discrimination does not exist and has  nothing to do with who gets money," said  Jay, whose department has been under tight  scrutiny from an expenditure review committee for months. "The IHA happens to be  an organization for people. It ranks with a  "The whole East-West discussion going  on about the U.S. and the Soviet Union is  focussed on Europe, whereas in actual fact  the closest place where the United States  and the Soviet Union meet each other is  in the Pacific. The U.S. has actually been  building up in the Northwest Pacific and  what that does to the people there is take  away their land, resources, and their human  rights."  Bridget Roberts talked about some of  the places she and de Ishtar toured in the  past year. "We went to Hawaii and then  through Micronesia, which for us included  the Marshall Islands, Belau and the Northern Marianas, then south to Fiji, Australia,  Aotearoa (the Maori name for New Zealand,  which the Maori people would prefer it to  be called), and back north through Tahiti  to Los Angeles. From there we've been doing a speaking tour from L.A. northwards  to Vancouver."  "In Hawaii we were lucky enough to go to  Kaho'olawe, an island sacred to the Hawaiian people, which has been used as a bombing and shelling range since 1941."  Due to longstanding pressure from local people to not bomb on the island during the RimPac exercises (war games which  happen every two years with the U.S. and  other Pacific Rim nations), all the participants except Canada and the U.S. have  stopped bombing Kaho'olawe. The current  campaign is aimed at stopping Canada and  the U.S.  The next leg of the women's journey took  them to the heart of one of the most devastated areas of the Pacific Islands. "In 1946,"  said de Ishtar, "the U.S. came into the Marshall Islands to carry out the nuclear test-  ing program. Sixty-six nuclear tests were ex-  hundred others ... We allocate funding on  the priority of function."  Jay says priorities are established partly  as a result of dialogue between Indian Affairs and the Indian community. At present,  the transfer of self government is the number one concern for both sides, he said, and  that is why organizations like the Pacific  Planning Symposium, for example, are being alloted consultation funding while the  IHA is not. "They are at the top of the priority list."  "The IHA is not at the top of the list,"  said Jay, adding that it is likely that many  other groups will not receive funding this  year.  ploded on Bikini Atoll and Enewetak. One  of the largest detonations was on Bikini  Atoll on March 1, 1954. This was a test  1,000 times stronger than the explosion over  Hiroshima."  "The fallout went over the inhabited islands, and was particularly severe on the island of Rongelap. The people hadn't been  warned about the test so they didn't take  any precautions. Within hours everyone was  suffering from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,  burnt skin, itching eyes. Prior to the test,  people were evacuated from other nearby islands, and brought back later. The military  could have evacuated the people of Rongelap but they didn't."  "U.S. servicemen on nearby Rongerik  told the authorities, 'Don't detonate. The  wind is blowing towards us.' They were told  to go in and shut the door. So they knew the  wind was blowing towards the inhabited islands."  "Seventy-two hours later the Rongelap  people were evacuated to a naval base on  Kwajalein Atoll, to a refugee camp. There,  their hair started to fall out, their fingernails started to fall off, and they were  still going through nausea, diarrhea and  trauma."  "They lived in this camp for three  months, then they were shifted to another  island where they lived for three years, and  then they were moved back onto Rongelap  without any attempt being made to clean  Rongelap. From 1957 to 1985 they lived on  Rongelap Atoll. It's there that we see a drastic increase in miscarriages, in stillbirths.  and a long list of birth defects including babies born with inturned feet, six fingers, and  mental retardation."  "The ultimate of what the Rongelap  women experienced was giving birth to babies that had no human shape whatsoever.  They looked like blobs of meat, like lumps  of jelly, and they have been called jellyfish  babies. They're born, they breathe for a few  hours and then they die. They are still being born today. Initially information about  the birth defects was kept quiet because the  women felt that it was their fault. They were  ashamed and embarrassed and would hide  these births."  "Other radiation-related problems have  included growth retardation, premature aging and various forms of cancer. Ninety percent of people who were on Rongelap at  the time of the explosion have been affected. Sixty-seven percent of the children  under the age of ten, at that time, have had  their thyroids removed, and there has also  been a marked increase in the incidence of  leukemia. And we have only seen a small  part of the effects, many of which are long  term."  "Since 1985, the Rongelap people have  been living on Mejato Island, which is, by  comparison to their home, a coral rock. On  Rongelap they had copper, plantations and  an abundance of food. On Mejato they have  very little in the way of food sources, very  rough waters for fishing, and no source of  cash income. Consequently they are dependent on U.S. food aid, which is very irregular and inadequate. Also they have no  money to buy clothes or gas for their boats,  or to educate their children. This is happening on an Atoll where the U.S. military has  some of the most sophisticated equipment  in the world."  Said Roberts, "The story of Rongelap is  just one story of the Marshall Islanders.  This group of islands is full of nations  with people affected by the testing program. The aboriginal people of Australia  are also suffering in a similar way. And the  Maohi of French-occupied Polynesia are going through the same problems, and we're  only just starting to hear about it."  The two women are planning to write a  book on the subject when they return to  Britain, to begin to fill a big gap in availability of information on the situation in the Pacific.

KINESIS INTERNATIONAL  Women, children and AIDS  Risk group: entire African population  by Nancy Pollak  For a reader, AIDS is about sex and  AIDS is about immensities: an almost daily  eruption of news stories and 'issues', endless doses of scientific and statistical data  (more or less disputable), political and ethical footballs tumbling across page and  screen, and—in our responses—the open-  ended emotions of fear and anger, sadness  and bewilderment. For the North American  reader, the media has made detachment  about AIDS, and the detaching of AIDS  from sex, virtually impossible.  Yet the press has itself displayed a singular detachment towards one of the syndrome's most glaring immensities: AIDS in  Africa. For the 100 million people of central Africa, the health and geopolitical crises  posed by AIDS cannot be neatly packaged  into morality tales or slightly rancorous  debates about chastity versus tell-it-like-  it-is. AIDS is literally devastating African  women, men and children, and the failure  of the media to 'cover the story' reflects a  racism towards Third World people and a  reluctance to treat AIDS as the complex  global health matter it is.  Grim Predictions  The concept of 'risk groups' like drug  takers is absurd: the 'risk group' in  sub-Saharan Africa is the entire population— The New Internationalist,  people have died—or are to die—due to infection by HIV, the Human Inmmunodefi-  ciency Virus which causes AIDS. Statistical  evidence has not been compiled, nor have  methods of reporting—or even diagnosing  ADDS—been standardized.  Based on existing data, however, the predictions are grim: up to ten percent of  the population of central Africa, the area  presently most hard hit, may be carriers of  HIV. Ten percent is ten million people.  The virus is infecting females and males  almost equally, with African babies and children forming a larger percentage of the infected population than anywhere else in the  world. The literal reason for the virus' indiscriminate spread lies in its means of transmission: through unprotected sexual contact, contaminated blood supplies and needles, and transmission via the womb or  breast milk.  Poverty, and the inadequacy of health  care systems in Africa have given the virus  every other reason to flourish.  Africans are already wrestling with  poverty-induced health problems of massive proportions. Five million children die  of malnutrition annually; half a million  more succumb to tetanus, measles, whooping cough and diptheria in Nigeria, Kenya  and Zaire alone. A terrible dimension of the  situation is that some methods currently  employed to curb traditional diseases are  probably contributing to the spread of HIV.  Vaccinations against common diseases  are thought to be saving 800,000 lives each  year. However, underfunded public health  programs—particularly in rural areas—  have meant medical practitioners are forced  to re-use needles, a prime route of transmission. Further, the vaccination itself can  cause a person previously infected with HIV  to develop AIDS because its 'nudging' of  the immune system may waken the inactive  virus.  Unrewarding Health Problems  Contaminated blood-bank supplies are a  major concern for health officials, especially  since blood transfusions are common in  Africa as a means of combatting malaria.  Blood supplies have already been seriously compromised: by the time the Rwandan and Norwegian Red Crosses set up a  comprehensive screening program in 1985,  one out of five Rwandan children had  been transfusion-infected. It is unlikely that  Rwanda's program will be speedily copied  by other nations: as Deborah Scroggins of  the Inter Dependent notes, "... the approximately $60 million spent on U.S. blood  bank screening in 1985 is more than thirty  times the entire health budget of many  African countries."  The challenge of developing an inexpensive test for infection has yet to  lure transnational pharmaceutical companies whose preference is to serve wealthier  nations with their more rewarding health  problems.  1146Commercial* 253-0913  Since breast milk is suspected as a  means of IHV transmission, major campaigns by African governments and development agencies to encourage African mothers  to breast feed their children may be yielding disastrous results. Breast feeding education programs arose as a response to a major  health issue: African women had been 'sold'  on powdered formula by food giants such as  Nestle's who were unconcerned that the water required to prepare the formula was frequently impure. In rural Africa, those water supplies are still often unhygienic or, in  the case of drought-stricken zones, scant.  Malnutrition and a generally weakened immune system—health problems  that afflict numerous African women and  children—constitute an unknown but worrisome factor in the virus' potential for developing into AIDS.  African women have drawn attention to  the role female genital mutilation may play  a choice that governments discourage and  some African states are reluctant to admit  to—and hence act on—the widespread presence of HIV in their cities, fearing a loss of  tourist revenues.  Not that acting on the AIDS threat  would be a simple matter for African countries. The HTV virus has characteristics that  make the chances of developing an effective  vaccine exceedingly difficult. At this time,  Zairians are working with French scientists  in testing a possible vaccine.  African health delivery systems are already severely overtaxed and underfunded;  as one doctor said, "How can you divert money from the immunization program  which is actually working and preventing  deathr?"  Furthermore, launching public education  campaigns to persuade people to alter their  sexual habits will come no easier to African  One out of  five Rwandan  children had been  transfusion-infected.  in HIV transmission. In certain African societies, young women are subjected to a ritual mutilation of their external genitals—  labia and clitoria—by their female elders.  The reasons for this practice are complex;  according to Hannah Edenikpong of Eket,  Nigeria, "... many of our rural women are  suffering under dangerous ... age-old traditions because of a lack of practical information that could change their lives." Another practice involves partly sewing up a  woman's vaginal opening in order to 'please'  her husband. Researchers have noted that  these mutilations may cause tearing and  bleeding to occur during sexual intercourse,  rendering women especially vulnerable to  infection.  Extreme Vulnerability  Another area of extreme vulnerability for  African women is in their role as sex workers. Prostitutes surveyed in urban centres  in Rwanda and Kenya exhibited high—and  increasingly higher—rates of infectiousness:  sixty-five percent in Nairobi in 1986. Among  prostitutes in Butare, Rwanda, HIV infection seems to correlate to treatment for  other sexually transmitted diseases, in other  words, women are believed to have been infected by dirty needles during their trips to  health clinics.  Most information about HTV frequency  comes from urban studies; it is believed, but  not yet documented, that African men who  become infected while working in cities are  carrying the virus home to their rural wives.  As in much of the Third World, economic options for young, single women are  few, and prostitution—serving local men as  well as tourists, business men and military  personnel—is one enduring 'choice'. It's not  officials than it has to their resource-and-  media-rich Western counterparts.  What marks AIDS as an extraordinary  health hazard to Africans is that it has the  potential of cheating the continent of its  young adults—those who, having survived  childhood diseases, are to form the productive backbone of civilization still tangled in  the economic and political trappings of neocolonialism.  As Graham Hancock, author of AIDS:  The Deadly Epidemic, writes, "Here in  the Third World there is virtually no automation or mechanization ... it is the  muscle power of people alone that grows the  food and creates the limited wealth upon  which the nations depend."  Canada is slowly and, in keeping with its  domestic policies on AIDS, inadequately responding to the crisis. In April, $5 million  was committed to a World Health Organization campaign directed towards educating  Third World medical personnel in the use of  hypodermics.  Nigeria's Hannah Edenikpong writes, "  ... over 80,000 people have died of AIDS  in Africa since 1984, and three-quarters of  those are women." In New York City, it is  estimated that 50,000 women of childbear-  ing age are infected with HTV; eighty percent are black and Latina women.  A spokesperson for Vancouver People  with Aids recently suggested that, "...  in New York City, people with AIDS are  being written off." There is a real danger  that, like their Third World counterparts in  the West, infected people in Africa are being written off—by overwhelming circumstances, by overwhelming neglect.  io KINESIS The judicial/prison system most often  comes up in feminist discussion in deciding  how to deal with men who commit crimes  against women. The urgency of ending  violence against us has compelled women  to implicitly support this system.  However, in doing this, we cut ourselves  off from the struggles of women who are  imprisoned. We also lose sight of our  long-term goal of a society not based  in coercion; a goal that requires the  dismantling of the prison system. We need  to remember how women's issues and  prison issues are part of the same struggle.  Prison issues are important for feminists  both because individual women are being  oppressed by prison and, in a wider  context, because the judicial/prison  system exists to support the larger power  structure that oppresses us all.  Women in prison are fighting to  maintain a sense of self within a system  that isolates and degrades; one which  attempts to teach submission to authority  through the constant exercising of power,  in both serious and petty ways, over  prisoners. What is generated is not  obedience but anger. And since a prisoner  risks punishment such as being sent to  segregation if she directs her anger at the  system that's hurting her, that anger often  gets directed inward or at other prisoners.  Because the most brutal methods of  social control are directed at a society's  most oppressed groups, the women most  likely to be sent to jail are poor and/or  women of colour. In North America, a  very high proportion are Native. That  the great majority of prisoners are in  for crimes against property shows the  system's role in maintaining the economic  order.  Prison is a type of violence which  enforces a state's power over its citizens,  in the same way that rape and battering  ■ill  enforce the power of men over women.  Since this kind of power by coercion  is antithetical to feminism, we need to  make prison abolition part of our feminist  analysis.  One implication of this is that we have  to reevaluate the strategy of trying to  have abusive men put in prison. For now,  it's one of the only strategies available  to protect women and children from  particularly violent men. What other  approach could be used remains a difficult  question. However, this doesn't have to  stop us from opposing the prison system  as a whole; we can recognize that if we use  the system to convict violent men, it is an  unsatisfactory and short term solution.  What we have to abandon is trying to  inject feminist values into an essentially  patriarchal system. We've seen how our  demands, even when clearly articulated,  are twisted and used in the state's  interests in our recent anti-pornography  work.  We've implicitly supported the system  by trying to change it using its own  terms. Since the severity of the penalty  for an action is supposed to express  society's amount of disapproval for that  action, feminists have pushed for stronger  penalties for crimes against women  as a way of increasing the expressed  disapproval for these crimes. This doesn't  work, for several reasons.  First, the justice system is controlled  through government by the economic elite.  It therefore supports that elite's interests  (retaining power) and will continue to  reflect their values and not those of  feminists.  An example of these values is a recent  sentencing by Supreme Court Judge  Samuel Toy. Finding a B.C. man guilty of  the rape and murder of a teenage woman,  he sentenced him to fifteen years to be  served concurrently with the sentence  he had already received for the rape  and murder of a second teenager. This  same judge three years ago imposed a life  sentence on political activist Ann Hansen  Salvadorean prisoners organize  In Uopango prison, El Salvador,  banners of the nation's liberation struggle  proclaim the resistance and organization  of the more than seventy women held  there.  In a communique written last summer  from Uopango prison, the women there  described their situation:  "In Dopango Women's Prison, we find  detained to this date seventy-four women  and twenty-five children. The majority of  us have been arrested, tortured and jailed  solely for having been 'pointed out' or  denounced as suspected of sympathizing  with popular organizations. Others  are held solely because they live in the  zones of conflict, or are members of  humanitarian organizations ...  "Thirty four percent of us have been  here more than one year, not knowing our  sentence and without the prospect that  any lawyer is going to concern himself  with our case. In some cases, after almost  two years of imprisonment, we are told  that our case records have disappeared,  and because of this, steps necessary to  obtain our freedom cannot be taken ...  "The presence of children here is  explained by the fact that eighteen percent  of us were pregnant when arrested and  the children were born in prison. Other  children are here because at the time of  arrest they took our children from us  and sent them to the penal centre, on the  order of a military judge. The children  came, in the majority of cases suffering  from malnutrition, fungi on their skin,  diarrhea, etc.  "Four of us have given birth to children  as a consequence of rapes to which we  were subject during our stay with the  'security' corps officers who arrested us.  "Owing to the application of the  unconstitutional decree #50 which  grants legal validity to testimony (or a  declaration) against us, that signs us over  into the power of the 'security' bodies, we  find ourselves here not knowing when we  will be leaving this jail, with our children  abandoned, our homes destroyed, and the  persecution that continues to terrorize our  families."  These women, together with hundreds  of male political prisoners held in  Mariona, the largest men's prison in El  Salvador, have formed the Committee of  Political Prisoners of El Salvador, and  are struggling to improve the existence  in prison for COPPES's members  which number over 1300. From inside  prison, COPPES members denounce the  brutal character of the regime that has  imprisoned them, and fight as they can  for human rights in El Salvador and for  freedom of all political prisoners.  Through a protracted struggle with  officials, the prisoners have won victories  to the extent that they administer many  aspects of daily life inside the prison.  Prisoner-organized crews cook and  distribute food, and maintain buildings,  etc. At Mariona, COPPES helps to  provide tools for political development  through a literacy campaign; families  and visitors supply writing utensils and  notebooks.  Imprisoned physicians staff the medical  clinic and train other prisoners as  paramedics; families of prisoners bring in  supplies. Before the clinic began, health  care in the prison was virtually nonexistent. More recently, the politicals have  fought to get prison authorities to provide  medical services to the other prisoners,  and the prison has established a clinic for  them. Many, however, chose to take their  health problems to the COPPES clinic.  This arrangement offers a degree of  convenience for prison administrators, who  do not appear eager to work any harder  than they have to. But it also reflects a  degree of autonomy which has been won,  not through the laziness or benevolence  of the administrators, but through a  protracted fight—by the prisoners. Since  its formation in 1980, COPPES prisoners  have struggled through six hunger strikes  to press their demands. One of the most  striking results of the efforts of Mariona  prisoners is that the guards remain outside  the compound, rather than inside with the  prisoners.

This raises another point. When we  support the state's imprisonment of a  rapist, we support the state's right to  imprison, period. And this is used against  us when we challenge the system.  In the last decade or so, women in  prison have also faced the backlash against  feminism. Previously, the court held  women less responsible for our actions  than men, and thus women received  shorter sentences. But this is one of the  few places where disparity between women  and men decreased quickly. One of the  state's first responses to our demands for  equal legal rights has been to hand out  longer sentences to women.  Another problem is the whole approach  of responding to someone's violent or  irresponsible behaviour with various  degrees of punishment. It implies that  revenge is the most important response to  a wrong-doing, rather than supporting the  victim or trying to prevent the behaviour  from happening again. It also suggests  that people have to be coerced to behave  responsibly.  Feminists must participate in the search  for alternate ways of dealing with those  who oppress. With the awareness that the  judicial/prison system is not our ally in  the long run, we'll be more reluctant to  ask one part of the patriarchy to protect  us from other parts.  Our other task is to learn about and  support the struggles of prisoners. Women  inside fight back and resist all the time.  And although there are few methods of  resistance open to prisoners, some of them  are: talking back to guards, breaking rules,  destroying prison property, participating  in sit-ins, occupations, work or hunger  strikes, and exposing brutality through the  media and through lawsuits.  Support from the outside is a crucial  factor in the success of prisoners'  campaigns. The knowledge that people  outside care about what's happening  contributes to prisoners' strength and  makes prison administrators respond much  more quickly to demands.  We can express our support for  particular campaigns against unfair  court decisions or treatment of prisoners  through letter writing, protest phone calls,  demonstrations and education campaigns  in our communities. We can also work  for reforms of the prison system, keeping  in mind that this is an interim measure  to abolishing prisons. This includes  lobbying governments to fund more prison  programs, with as many options available  to female as male prisoners and training in  a variety of jobs.  On an ongoing basis, we need to  strengthen connections with our sisters  inside. We must recognize women  prisoners' struggles as an essential part of  our movement. We can do this by:  • visiting women in prison, when possible;  meeting with individual women who  want visits, organizing informational or  skill-sharing workshops, musicians can  play gigs at prisons and so on.  • writing to women prisoners who request  letters of support or correspondence.  • sharing our resources; sending money to  defense funds and prisoner support or  action groups, donating books, musical  instruments, art supplies to prisoners.  • sharing information; sending periodicals  free to prisoners, soliciting articles  from prisoners, and providing material  support to prisoner publications.  KINESIS      87 June LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY:  LAKESIDE:  A woman in British Columbia who  receives a prison sentence of less than two  years will probably be sent to Lakeside  Correctional Centre, a provincial jail in  Burnaby. If her sentence is longer, she  becomes a federal prisoner and usually  goes to Canada's only federal women's  Kingston, Ontario.  The several acres of land which  Lakeside shares with Oakalla, a men's  provincial jail, actually are situated beside  a lake. A decade ago, women prisoners  were allowed to swim there. But for some  years, tighter security regulations have  confined outside recreation to two small  fenced yards beside the prison building.  About seventy women are housed there,  many of them street women who have  done several bits in Lakeside. Because  there are no remand facilities in B.C.,  women from throughout the province  who are being held until their trials are  also sent to Lakeside. There are a few  federal prisoners there as well. To ease  overcrowding at Kingston, the federal and  provincial governments have reached an  to go more places, got to do more things.  We got day passes, group passes, shopping  passes, a group outing to go to a concert.  It may only have been once a month but it  was something to look forward to. They  had less problems with us too because  the girls had things to work on and look  forward to, to build their privileges up to  get out on these passes.  What other programs have been cut?  We used to go out to Woodlands (with)  the mentally and physically handicapped  kids. The girls used to have a ball with  the kids and vice versa. That was an  excellent program. It made a lot of people  who never had to deal with retarded kids  realize that they're people too. It made  a lot of good come out of the people at  Lakeside too. When they got back from a  day with working with those kids, it was  like two different people, you wouldn't  know it was the same person. It really  helps when you've got something to do  that's helping other people.  Is there anything for people who go  in there sick (from drug withdrawal)?  There's no program for sick people. We  used to have a methadone program and  Sure, that's what unit rep meetings  are all about, so that they can sit around  and pretend that they're keeping us  informed about things or they're asking  our opinions about things, and ninety  percent of the time after they have an  inmate-staff meeting, they go and have a  staff meeting on their own, and ninety-  nine percent of our stuff is shot down  anyway.  These people can't even give us an  extra ten minutes for a late night to finish  a movie, these people can't even get it  together enough to give a group of girls  ten extra minutes to watch a whole movie  rather than lock them up at ten to eleven.  It's a real drag, you watch a movie for  two hours and they're hustling you off like  children. We're murderers, robbers and  stuff and they're telling us to go to bed  ten minutes before the show's over.  That irritating petty garbage is what's  the hardest to deal with; you're here, you  got to do your time, you can accept that,  and here you've got a dozen rules that  have to be followed or you go to the hole.  It's the little rules inside the rules  inside the rules ...

How*ver,  these women lose their federal privileges,  including access to some programs.  We spoke to Teri Brewer about  conditions at Lakeside, shortly after her  recent release on parole:  I'd like to ask you about your day to  day reality at Lakeside, what's it like  being in there?  Boring. The worst disease in there is  boredom. There's nothing happening,  there's nothing to do. Our school system  is very small, for the chosen few. That's it,  there's nothing else to do in there.  You must feel like you're wasting  your time there.  I've wasted over ten years of my life  there, in that jail in particular, it's been a  total waste of ten years of my life.  Have you seen a lot of change?  Yeah, for the worse, for the worse.  _ When I first went there, we had a male  warden, deputy, male guards, and it was  fine ... security wise it was fine. We got  stuff for drug withdrawal. Now everything  is just cold turkey, everything. At most  you can get a sleeping pill for one or two  nights.  So that must be fairly disturbing both  for the people who are going through  the cold turkey and for the rest of the  women.  Yeah. H you've been in there for a long  time, and you see someone you know  from the street and there ain't nothing  you can do to help them, you can't give  them aspirins for their joints. Sometimes  they're so sick they don't want a rubdown  or anything.  The methadone program was good. I  don't know why they slashed it. It was a  stupid thing to do because dope fiends in  general need the crutch to survive, it's a  crutch, it's a weakness and to put them  in there and just cold turkey them is just  not always the answer. They're just going  to get out and do it again, as they say.  Because in the meantime from the time  they're sick, and then they're not sick,  they do their she months and then they hit  the street again, they've had no training,  they've had no program, they've had  nothing to help them with changing their  lives. And there's only one halfway house  that holds twelve girls in the whole Lower  Mainland.  If anyone did want to take advantage of  the rehabilitation programs, the only thing  they can do within those walls is to go to  school. There's nothing much. There's AA  and Narcanon and stuff but AA's the only  group that's got any backbone or support  that I can see.  Is there any kind of organization  between the prisoners?  Yeah, unit reps get together, but that's,  you know, what can you do there? It's just  to discuss the administration bullshit and  straighten out the messes they get us in  and other problems within the jail.  Do you think the administration is  receptive to suggestions from inside  about things that need to be changed?  says 'No', another staff says'Yes', and it's  like that every day of your life in there.  I would rather it go back twenty years  in time, where it was; 'Here's your rules,  you break them, you're in the digger for  a year.' I can deal with that. I can't deal  with all these ten days here, fifteen days  here, five days there for (saying) 'Fuck you'.  It's stupid.  What would you consider to be  something better to have been done for  you right at the beginning?  Well, when they gave me eight years  and I was sixteen years old? That's a  bit harsh. I don't know, I don't have the  answers. I'm no better than the next guy,  I don't have the answers either, but I just  know it was wrong to put a sixteen year  old girl in jail for eight years, that was  definitely wrong. And maybe I wouldn't  have gone back if they didn't do that, but  then again maybe I would have. I don't  know. But I think that eight years was a  bit much, you know, I turned seventeen in  Oakalla, that's a bit harsh.  Are you afraid of being  institutionalized?  Fll never be institutionalized. They'll  never institutionalize me. If I spent three  years in a cell all by myself, Fd come out  of there just as same as when I went in.  Fm not going to be someone that gets out  on the street and the first thing that goes  wrong, I go 'Wah, I need a screw to tell  me what to do'. No. Never. I never needed  a screw to tell me what to do.  And now I'm working with my animals,  and even though I'm in a halfway house I  feel strong. I just hope the damage the jail  system has done to my mind isn't so great  that I can't cope. I hope I make it this  time, to prove there are survivors. Hang in  girls!  The   B.C.

After years of experimenting  with behaviour modification units and  special handling units, the U.S. Federal  Bureau of Prisoners (BOP) most recent  development is the new 'control unit' for  women at Lexington Federal Penitentiary  in Kentucky.

The intent  is to destroy the political identities of  prisoners and to neutralize the influence of  that person and her or his politics.  Politicals and POWs have long been  used in experimental operations by the  BOP. Marion Federal Penitentiary in  Illinois is the prototype for the Lexington  control unit and also for the notorious  political prisons in West Germany. Marion  prison has been used as an experiment in  the control of prisoners, predominantly  Third World prisoners and those who are  either politicals or outspoken resisters  within the prison system.  desired in order to win favour and a  reprieve from pressure  Shein also recommended:  physical removal of prisoners  from those they respect (to) break or  seriously weaken close emotional ties  and using techniques of character  invalidation, ie. humiliations,  revilement, and shoutings to induce  feelings of guilt, fear and suggestibility,  coupled with sleeplessness and  exacting prison regimen and periodic  interrogational interviews.  While prison and government  authorities do their best to deny the  Women's control unit designed to isolate  (imprisoned for conspiracy and sedition),  and North American anti-imperialist  political prisoner Susan Rosenburg were  the first to be transferred to the $735,000  unit, which is designed to hold sixteen  women. Silvia Baraldini, another North  American anti-imperialist, was moved to  Lexington in January 1987.  The conditions they face there include:  • 23 hour/day lockdown in complete  isolation from all other prisoners in the  institution  • no social visits with anyone other than  their immediate families  • strip searches every time they leave  their cells for recreation in the yard  • denial of access to any of the  educational and recreational programs  available to other prisoners  • photographing of both family visitors  and attorneys before they are allowed to  visit  • correspondents limited to fifteen people  who must be investigated and approved  before they can send or receive any mail  • constant video surveillance and  surveillance by the guards, who have  been instructed not to converse with the  • constant changes in the rules which do  not appear in print anywhere  This kind of control unit is specifically  designed to isolate political prisoners and  POWs from the general prison population  and to isolate them from their political  E  The women in Lexington have been  told that the control unit was designed  for women prisoners where there is a  threat that 'external forces' might aid  in an escape, and that they have been  placed there because of their pohtical  associations.  The conditions at Lexington are  designed so that prisoners have absolutely  no power over their lives. Their  movements, what they read, what they  wear, and who can they talk to are all  regulated. And for women prisoners, the  amount of repression they face inside  prison is intensified by sexual harassment  and assaults against them. Before  Alejandrina and Susan were transferred to  the unit from prison in Tucson, Arizona,  they were subjected to forcible rectal  and vaginal searches by a male medical  technician while being held down by  guards, and now in Lexington they are  forced to undergo regular strip searches.  None of this is brought about  haphazardly. Federal and prison  authorities introduce new programs and  techniques as a result of much research.  At a 1982 meeting in Washington, D.C,  between social scientists and prison  wardens, Dr. Edward Schein presented  an address called "Man Against Man:  Brainwashing." He advised placing  individuals  into new and ambiguous situations  for which the standards are kept  deliberately unclear, and then  pressuring to conform to what is  existence of prisoners of war and political  prisoners in their jails, new methods of  control are regularly aimed specifically at  this part of the prison population. When  Alejandrina and Susan asked about the  new control unit before their transfer,  they were told, "it is for the women  terrorists". Still, the conditions faced by  those prisoners are kept quiet in order  to downplay resistance to the actions of  government and to promote the image of a  'humanitarian' justice system.  Alejandrina Torres states, "The purpose  of the government's counter-insurgency  strategy is to destroy the growth and  support of our national liberation and  social justice and to deter dissent and civil  disobedience ... We will continue because  in order to achieve justice and peace for  our people and other oppressed peoples,  we must dare to struggle, dare to win."  The women in the Lexington  control unit have been told that they  can be transferred out of the unit if  the conditions that resulted in their  designation no longer exist—in other  words, if they renounce their politics.  In the face of such grim prospects  for the women in Lexington (and in  many other prisons), it's important  that the long term fight against such  measures be continued. The National  Committee to Free Puerto Rican POWs,  the Committee to Fight Repression, and  other organizations are participating in a  campaign to shut down Lexington, Marion  and all control units.  Concentrated appeals and campaigns  can have an effect on the hves of women  inside. In 1984, the B.O.P. tried to set up  a control unit like Lexington's at Davis  Hall in Alderson prison for women, West  Virginia.  Puerto Rican POWs Hay dee Torres and  Lucy Rodriguez were held in the unit for  nine months in complete isolation, even  from each other. A massive protest led by  the Puerto Rican independence movement  first resulted in somewhat improved  conditions and treatment, and eventually  succeeded in getting the two women  transferred into the general population at  Pleasonton Prison in California.

Havdee Torres  xistence of political prisoners denied  by Susan Rosenburg  In the United States today there  are over one hundred prisoners of war  and political prisoners. We all have in  common our active resistance to the  U.S. government in its war crimes and  war machine, in the colonization and  attacks against nations struggling for  self-determination and independence,  in its racist and unjust system based on  white supremacy and bourgeois rule, in its  violence and domination of women. Some  are prisoners of war captured in the course  of struggling for the liberation of their  nations: Puerto Rico, New Africa and  Native American nations. We are classified  as 'violent, extremist and terrorist' by the  federal and state prison systems to justify  all treatment at the hands of the prison  authorities.  The purpose of this classification is to  cement the process of criminalization.  The prisons need to deny our existence,  to mask the reality that there is  revolutionary resistance from within.  The prisons as part of the Justice  Department beheve that by destroying  POWs and political prisoners they will  destroy and demoralize the movements  and social forces that we represent. The  patterns of violent counterinsurgency  used by imperialism around the world are  institutionalized in the prisons today.  The physical and psychological attacks  on women POWs and pohtical prisoners  have grown more violent and systematic  as the Federal Bureau of Prisons and  the U.S. Marshall Service have become  less and less concerned with maintaining  the appearance of due process. The anti-  terrorist conference in Puerto Rico in 1978  laid out guidelines for repression against  revolutionary movements, particularly the  Puerto Rican Independence movement.  They state that because revolutionary  individuals cannot be rehabilitated, they  must be sentenced to lengthy prison  terms, they must be isolated, they cannot  be allowed to become martyrs. In other  words, revolutionaries must be neutralized.  In the field this means death; in the  prisons this means political and physical  destruction.  The intent is to drive political  prisoners crazy, to alienate prisoners,  to set up prisoners, to kill prisoners.  The justification is 'maximum security  status' and the classification is 'terrorist'.  The prisons, while publicly denying  our existence, understand full well that  political prisoners represent a special  threat to the system and are not the  same as other prisoners. Within these  walls everything is done to intensify that  difference.  The use of sexual violence is part of the  program. It has always been a particular  weapon used against women, but in  the prisons, it is policy against women  political prisoners and POWs. Isolation,  physical brutality, psychological torture,  sexual threats and intimidation are used  to destroy our spirit of resistance. The  hole, the box, segregation, mental wards,  prison hospitals, holding women prisoners  in men's prisons, and control units—the  names of these conditions change, but  the repressive measures serve the same  function ...  Sexual threats and sexism as a weapon  are rampant in the prisons as a whole.  It is an underpinning of the institutional  policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons  (BOP). It is encouraged and applauded by  the administration and by the guards. One  regulation says that male guards can pat  search a woman prisoner at any time. In  an 'emergency' situation, a male guard can  strip search a woman prisoner. Defining  an emergency situation is left up to the  individual discretion of the guard. In  every case where sexually abusive contact  on the part of guards against us has  happened, it is the prisoner's word against  the guard's. Strip searches are conducted  regularly after any contact with non-BOP  personnel.  The Lexington unit is the first complete  control unit for women. The BOP has  taken twenty five years of experimentation  in 'behaviour', in control, in their  counterinsurgency studies and practices,  and from that, created Lexington. It is  designed to prevent 'external terrorist  attacks' which is reflected in its design,  its location in the basement of the larger  Lexington Federal Correctional Institute  (FCI). All women POWs and pohtical  prisoners will go to Lexington at some  time or another. If they are not designated  there, then it will be used as a threat, or  resulting from set-ups, women will be sent  there.

Attention Move!  This is America! By Margot  Harry,    Chicago, 1987.  Pamuk Yildiz was seventeen  years old when she was arrested  in October 1980. She was detained along with the other members of the Akdere group of the  Dev Yol (Revolutionary Path) organization.  Pamuk Yildiz was one of the  innumerable members or supporters of left wing groups thrown  into prison and ill-treated or tortured following the Turkish army's  seizure of power on 12th September 1980. She is still there.  At the time of her detention according to her mother and friends  she was 'a very healthy young girl'.  However during her custody in notorious prisons and interrogation  centres her health rapidly deteriorated. Eventually, in 1983, the authorities took her to the Ankara  Mevki hospital, where Dr. Deniz  Demirkan diagnosed heart disease.  When she was returned to prison  Dr. Demirkan requested that she  must be given regular treatment.  This was never done.  In March 1984 Pamuk Yildiz's  mother, Akkiz Yildiz was driven  frantic by the news that her  daughter was dying. She heard  from released prisoners that her  daughter was not getting any hospital treatment. She had still not  even been brought to trial. When  Mrs. Yildiz tried to complain to  the authorities they increased the  maltreatment of Pamuk and her  condition deteriorated further.  In 1985 Pamuk Yildiz was finally sentenced by a military court  to "fifteen years heavy imprisonment". She was twenty-two years  old. In 1986, in accordance with  laws passed by the civilian regime  which had replaced the ruling  Junta, Pamuk Yildiz's lawyer applied to the No 1 Martial Law  Court for her release. This was  done on the basis that Pamuk had  served six years and one day in  prison. Under the law she should  therefore have been released on the  3rd November 1986.  Instead, the regime's state prosecutor    carried    out    a    sick  manoeuver—he appealed against  the original sentence. The state is  now asking a higher court to sentence Pamuk Yildiz to hang.  On the 1st December in the  No 4 Martial Law Court Pamuk's  lawyer said "It is unthinkable to  give her more than fifteen years  imprisonment even more so when  you consider that her health is broken, her file is under review by the  military authorities and the prosecutor did not file his appeal until long after the original sentence"  ... during the appeal period "her  sickness will become incurable."  The court refused to release Pamuk.  As her lawyer pointed out, this  decision is against human rights  and every normal understanding  of law.  Pamuk Yildiz is alone and seriously ill in Mamak Military  Prison.

Amnesty Campaigns  U.S. activists behind bars  Anti-imperialist activists, Laura  Whitehorn, Marilyn Buck and  Linda Evans were all arrested in  May of 1985; Laura in Baltimore  and Marilyn and Linda in Dobbs  Ferry, N.Y.  Laura Whitehorn has been  struggling in the anti-imperialist  clandestine movement for over  twenty years, and was convicted  earlier this year of passport fraud  and faces a possible five year sentence. She had been held in five  different institutions since her arrest.  Laura, who was charged with  assault and possession of weapons  and false I.D.s, was granted a mistrial in January of 1986 after it  was revealed that the evidence had  been illegally obtained by the FBI.  No ruling has yet been made on  the government's appeal of that  decision.  During the government's appeal, Laura was held in total  isolation for four months, from  April to August 1986, at Alderson  Prison's Davis Hall. She was kept  in twenty-three hour-a-day lock-up  with no contact with other prisoners and allowed only two phone  calls a week (one to her lawyer),  and no visitors other than her immediate family, even though she  had not yet been convicted of any  crime.  On August 13, 1986 she was  transferred to the Metropolitan  Correctional Centre (MCC) in  New York City, probably in response to a national post card  campaign   protesting  her   condi  tions and treatment at Davis Hall.  At MCC New York, Laura has  been subjected to almost constant  harassment by guards and prison  personnel.  Linda Evans was convicted and  sentenced last spring in New York  on charges that she harbored Marilyn Buck in the hours immediately preceding the arrest of both  women. Linda, who represented  herself, says, "My defense there  was ... that although Marilyn and  I are comrades, both part of the  anti-imperialist movement, my intent  in any  of my  actions  was  return to prison after a furlough in  1977. During this time she was the  subject of intense FBI searches, yet  continued in the struggle to build  an anti-imperialist resistance, in  particular to build an alliance of  white people with the black liberation struggle.  She was re-arrested in May,  1985 on charges which include  helping to liberate New Afrikan  Freedom Fighter Assata Shakur  from prison in 1979, a series  of conspiracy indictments related  to fighting in solidarity with the  | Marilyn Buck  never to 'harbour' her.

Peru  Alejandra and Ubaldina Huaman  Ccahua were arrested between  November 4 and 6, 1986 in Cuzco  following guerilla attacks on two  Civil Guard posts during which  several Civil Guards were killed.  They are accused, along with six  men, of being part of a "death  commando" of the Shining Path  guerilla movement. While in custody of the Civil Guard they were  severely tortured and subjected to  mock hangings. They were sexually abused (including having electric shocks applied to their genitals) and had large instruments inserted into their rectums, and as a  result are now suffering serious infections. Released on November 12  by the Civil Guard into the hands  of the Peruvian Investigative Police, all eight people remain imprisoned, even though a special commission (set up by the Peruvian  Minister of the Interior) concluded  that they were innocent.  Gloria Marta Tineo Garcia, of  Accoro, Huamanga province, was  taken away from her home in the  presence of her family by an army  officer and three soldiers on January 3, 1987. Her family has been  unable to obtain any information  about her whereabouts from the  army.  Amnesty International contin  ues to receive numerous reports of  torture, "disappearance" and extrajudicial executions in Peru. Frequent targets of such human rights  violations are peasants, community leaders, teachers, students  and trade union leaders.  South Africa  Vangiwe Matyunjwa was arrested  by South African security police  on December 1, 1986 at her place  of work, The People's Advice Office in East London. Arrested with  her was her four year old son,  Phila, who was later brought back  to the office and is now being cared  for by a family friend. Her three  older children are being cared for  by relatives.  Vangiwe Matyunjwa, who is in  her mid-thirties, has been working for some time at the People's  Advice Office.

Randall  By the time you read this, the day the  teacher's didn't teach so they could study  Bill 19 will be history, but Fd like to tell you  the story from my little corner of the world  because it was so B.C. Also, every time we  have a pohtical incident (you've heard of  nuclear incidents, haven't you? Well I think  B.C. has pohtical incidents.) I keep thinking that if I just pay attention to what happened I'll know what to do, so that at least  if there's going to be a power struggle we  can be part of it. (By "we" I mean the politically disappeared in the province of B.C.)  The first thing that happened is that the  Socred government tabled Bills 19 and 20.  The second thing that happened is that the  labour movement responded with outrage  in the press, probably other places too but  through the press is how the general public found out that battle had been joined.  Frankly, I was appalled by what I heard  about the legislation but I did not immediately don my battle gear and head for the  trenches.  The past few years in B.C. have given me  a thirst for effectiveness. When I do act I  want it to effect something. It is this thirst  that has probably caused my political activity to retreat from action to contemplation.  It is hard to know how to be effective.  For the last few years, it has been turning out that mostly when I feel ineffective,  it's because I am. Along with thousands of  others. What's changed? The course of history? Them? Us?  These are some of the questions that occurred to me when I heard about the one  day study session. I think they occurred to  other people too because when one of the  drivers hanging around the time clock asked  out loud what we were going to do to support the teachers, there was a general shuffling of feet and a vocal non-response from  the other drivers.  We were going to have a union meeting  the week before the teachers' study session  so I figured we'd talk about it there. As it  turned out I couldn't go, but the CBRT &  GW (Canadian Brotherhood (sic) of Railway, Transport and General Workers) sent  out a memo from the B.C. Federation of  Labour which I read that explained what  the bills meant to collective bargaining. It  was worse than I had imagined.  The union also sent out ballots from the  B.C. Fed asking union members to vote.  The question was: "Do you support our  unions' opposition to Bill 19 including a  boycott of the legislation?"  Now I noticed that that's actually two  questions but there was only one yes box  and one no box on the ballot. I thought  this was quite strange because my guess was  that most of the people where I work would  vote yes to the first part and no to the second. How can you boycott legislation?  I had a hard time believing that such a  blatant oversight as one vote on two points  could be the result of ignorance. It felt to  me like the B.C. Fed didn't trust its membership to back their strategy but they intended to go ahead with it anyway so they  rigged the question.  I don't know what the B.C. Fed intended  but it felt to me like they were trying an end  run around my intelligence, which among  other things, is insulting because I am more  than ready to oppose the Socred legislation.  But then I'm forced to consider the possibility that the Fed does not share my thirst  for effectiveness. Anyway, all this occurred  to me but I did my part by voting my one  yes. After all, the legislation is much worse  than a manipulated vote.  Later I drove up to a school early and  went over to the other bus driver to see how  things had gone. Well she didn't say anything about the union meeting but she said  plenty about the teachers. I said, "How are  we going to support the teachers," and she  said, "I don't entirely agree with the teachers." This was not good news. This woman  is one of the people who is active in our local, but it turns out that she has a huge load  of resentment to work through before she  can get to union solidarity with the teachers.  She regaled me with several stories in  which individual teachers had undermined  and undervalued her work as a volunteer  teacher's aide, disregarded her expertise as  a parent, and valued their 'professional'  time above her work as a school bus driver  and the safety of her bus.  Now I know that not all teachers are like  that, and so does this woman, it's just that  she's had too many experiences with teachers who treated her like a menial instead  of an ally. Now when the teachers needed  their allies, this woman felt too put down to  stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Unfortunately in the days to come I found that  she was not alone. Is somebody dealing with  this? I didn't know what to do or where to  turn. I just know that the legislation is far,  far more belittling than any teacher.  The Friday before the Tuesday study session, one of the teachers followed her kids  out to my bus for a little chat. "So," she  says, "we go out." "It looks like it," I said.

I sat down first so it wasn't my fault that  I ended up across from the two men board  members.  Over dessert one of them started to go  on about what a big mistake the teachers' action had been. "Why?" I said, "They  were only responding to the government's  legislation." "That's a load of garbage," he  snapped. (My favorite thing about B.C. is  the level of political discourse.) Now what  do I do, I wondered.  Meanwhile, he had gone on to say that  the trouble with the B.C. Teachers' Federation (BCTF) was that they were playing politics. (A Catholic priest would have  asked, "Alone or with others?") I was trying to figure out a pleasant way to say I  thought the government had played a little politics itself when help arrived. Fortunately there was a woman board member sitting next to me who moved into the  breech quite smoothly.  The problem with the teachers, she said,  is that they've allowed the government to  I don't know what the B.C. Fed intended but it  felt to me like they were trying an end run  around my intelligence.  She rolled her eyes and shrugged. "What  else can we do," she said. "I just hope it  helps."  "If everybody all over the province went  out, that would work," she said. (Is there a  term like deja vu for when you hear things  again instead of see them again—deja?) I  said it seemed like the Socreds were counting on the teachers not to be able to pull  out all their membership. She sighed heavily, "Ya," she said, "but I will not be here  on Tuesday. I will not be like those others."  "Good luck," I said. (Now you can see why  I thirst for effectiveness?)  Then came the Monday before. Those of  us who drove for the Vancouver and Delta  school districts got notices in our boxes  telling us not to report for work on Tuesday. Delta had closed down all together and  Vancouver said the schools would be open  but they called and cancelled the bus service. Some people sat in the sun and some  sulked over the loss of pay. Wednesday we  were back at work.  Thursday I went to a volunteers' dinner at the South Vancouver Neighborhood  house. The volunteer dinner looked about  do all their licensing and accrediting. She  said she was a social worker and that she  belonged to two organizations. Her professional organization licensed, accredited and  disciplined members of her profession and  she belonged to the union at her work place.  She said the teachers should have that too.  The man nodded his head.  She then went on to say that the legislation was very bad and that it totally destroyed collective bargaining. He didn't tell  her that was garbage. I was so impressed. I  had no idea whether her thinking was the  same as the BCTF's but at least she was  talking to this man about the importance  of workers being able to bargain collectively  and he was listening. I thanked her afterwards and she told me that she had gone to  a study session sponsored by her union and  that it had been very good. (Aha! I thought.  This is a clue to effectiveness.)  At this point I really don't know what to  make of it all. It does seem to me though  that standing up for a principle will never  be a force unless we make a blood and guts  union with the people in our daily lives.  t<MA0J5  A RELIABLE SOURCE OF ORGANIC FOOD  * Fresh Produce * Soy Products  * Dried Fruit & Nuts • Wholegrain Foods  * Pure Juices * Natural Yogurts  * Cafe Altura  Write or call for Wholesale catalog & buying club information  ~ WE SHIP THROUGHOUT CANADA~  '~Wifrl '~\A)o<ii-^ Canada's Largest Organic Produce  vvua     vveyc^ Wholesaler  UraaniC jiarvcst^ 10 Years of Dependable Service  ^Co-operative Ongoing Certification Program  J Worker-Owned & Managed  2471 Simpson Rd., Richmond, B.C.   V6X2R2/604-276-2411  KINESIS 87 June LESBIANS  and  IA G I N G  by Sally Shamai and  Maureen Ashfield __  Gerontology is the study of aging. As students at Simon Fraser University we have  learned about the physiology of aging. We  have explored what is and is not normal aging, women and aging, abuse of the elderly,  transportation issues, institutionalization of  the elderly, care facilities, care-giving, alcoholism and many other issues. However we  were struck by the glaring omission in the  course work of any discussion of the older  gay popul at ion.  We know that ten percent of the population is gay and therefore we assume the  same percentage of the elderly population  must be gay as well, but where are they  mentioned? We were left with questions  such as where are the elderly gay; how are  they living their lives; how do they deal with  the double oppression of being gay and aged  (not to mention race, class, gender or other  oppressions); who makes up their support  systems; what are their lives like; if in a heterosexual care facility how do they deal with  the isolation of being invisible or closeted;  and what are the issues that older gay people identify for themselves?  The majority of information that exists  on the older gay population looks at older  gay men and very little exists on older  lesbians. Some issues of relevance to gay  men hold for older lesbians, but we were  aware that older lesbians would have different issues and we wanted to find out  what they were. We hoped the information  we obtained would be useful for identifying needed support services, would help in  the education of those who work with the  elderly, would provide direction in the development of advocacy strategies and enhance our own education and understanding about the issues lesbians confront as we  age. Therefore, we undertook a study to address these questions.  Since so little has been written about  lesbians, we assumed very little and our  project was exploratory in nature. Topics we  covered included socio-demographics, sexual history and sexuality, self-acceptanc^  family involvements, social relationships n  and outside the gay community, adaptations  to aging now and in the future, and perceived support for service needs.  We had limited time to complete this  project which served as a drawback to  reaching the diversity of older lesbians that  we know exist. We interviewed sixteen lesbians between the ages of fifty and sixty-  three and found that there are issues identified by these women regarding aging and  lesbianism.  Our results were divided into five general  areas:  • how our study relates to previous literature  • areas of concern identified by participants  • effect of 'coming out' early or late in life  • other significant findings  • suggestions for future study.  One area of the literature suggests that  there are unique medical, legal, institutional  and emotional concerns for aging gay people. This suggestion was also supported by  our study. The women we spoke with expressed concerns about their partners not  being acknowledged or given legitimacy by  health care professionals, about visitation  rights of their partners or close friends and  about guardianship and wills.  While many of the women we interviewed would look to the government for  care should they become physically dependant, most expressed fear of being in institutions where their sexual identity would be  ignored or discriminated against or where  they would be isolated from other lesbians.  Some women suggested that the services  assumed to benefit all older people (community centres, church groups, senior's centres, homemakers, grief support services,  etc.) could not be assumed to help them  as these services are set up with the assumption that all older people are heterosexual. These services are neither sensitive  to nor accepting of the needs and lifestyles  of older gay men and lesbians. The lack of  social supports such as meeting places for  older lesbians, and the difficulty of meeting  other older lesbians was a recurring theme  throughout most of the interviews.  Three general categories of concern were  identified by these women: family, social  supports and societal services.  Many of the women had family (including  biological children) with whom they were  regularly in touch but who they did not  identify as their main source of support as  they aged. Nine respondents did not have  biological children and most identified 'chosen family' (ie. friends and lovers rather  than biological family) as their primary support. The apparent lack of family support  (a source of support largely assumed in the  heterosexual population) was identified as a  concern.  Half of the respondents reported losing  close friends as a result of their homosexuality and some commented that this resulted  in a loss of peers with whom they shared a  common history and age. They realized the  impact of this loss more as they aged.  As mentioned earlier, the lack of a  network of older lesbians was seen as  a problem. Most enjoyed socializing with  both older and younger lesbians however  some expressed the desire for 'older lesbian only' groups to meet needs that inter-  generational groups do not. A related problem was a feeling of isolation as older women  in the lesbian community.  This was expressed in terms of feeling  like a 'curiosity', not feeling included, being  talked down to, being treated like a mother  figure or being ignored. Seven of the sixteen  felt they were invisible as older women in  the lesbian community.  Several findings further emphasize the  lack of older lesbian networks. The mean response to the question 'what proportion of  your friends are lesbians?' was seventy percent. At the same time, thirteen said that  most of their lesbian friends were more than  ten years younger than themselves. Leisure  time predominantly was spent with younger  lesbians. Yet most felt more comfortable  talking about aging with people (whether  homosexual or heterosexual) their own age  or older, then to younger lesbians.  There was a perception of age segregation in the lesbian community. When asked  to comment on what might be the attitudes  of lesbians under thirty towards those over  fifty, the general response was that younger  lesbians saw older lesbians as 'curiosities',  as non-sexual, as the worst part of mother  figures, and one older lesbian wondered if  younger lesbians even thought of them at  all.  When asked to comment on what might  be the attitudes of lesbians over fifty towards lesbians under thirty, they suggested  that older lesbians see younger lesbians  young and immature and feel they are i  sensitive to the older lesbian's lifestyles and  reasons for being closeted. When asked how  they personally felt about younger lesbians,  some found them boring because of differences in life experiences and stages, but  most responded that age was not an issue  and that they had many younger friends and  enjoyed being with them. This perception of  ageism is an issue that the lesbian community needs to address.  Younger lesbians saw older  lesbians as'curiosities',  as non-sexual,  as the worst part of mother  figures, and one  older lesbian wondered  if younger lesbians even  thought of them at all.  The kinds of services that the women in  this study saw as being useful fell into four  main areas. They were:  • recreational: outdoor activity groups, including low cost recreation  • social: restaurants and other meeting  places and social events specifically for  older lesbians  • housing: lesbian only apartment blocks  and senior's homes and communities  • societal supports and services: support  groups, educational events, and workshops designed for older lesbians, lesbian only or lesbian and gay men only  homemaking services, friendly visiting,  legal advocacy, peer counselling, resource  centres, printed information directed towards meeting the needs of older lesbians  and information about gay lifestyles to  professionals who work with seniors.  We asked specifically about the value of  lesbian or lesbian and gay men nursing and  retirement homes, social organizations and  grief support services and their preference  for each. Generally there was s support for  We asked specifically about the value of  lesbian or lesbian and gay men nursing and  retirement homes, social organizations and  grief support services and their preferecne  for each. Generally there was support for  j KINESIS  wm  ft  the value of segregated settings however not  all respondents would choose a lesbian only  or lesbian and gay only setting for themselves. Nine of the respondents indicated a  preference for mixed settings as long as they  felt accepted and could openly be who they  were. Half said that they would prefer not to  be with men at all for a variety of reasons.  Generally, the study revealed interesting  aspects about how the time that one 'comes  out' in life relates to accepting a homosexual identity. For example, there seemed to  be three patterns of 'coming out' which we  named 'early', 'early-late' and 'late'.  The first, group, 'early', realized they  were attracted to other women at a young  age (childhood or early adolescence) and expressed and acknowledged it soon after.  The 'early-late' group realized their attraction at a young age but did not express  or accept it until well into adulthood (30  and older).  The third group, 'late', did not realize until an older age (30's 40's or 50's) that they  were attracted to women. Once they had realized it, they soon accepted and acted on it.  There is much discussion about the first  two groups in terms of adult development  and sexual identity in the literature. The  third group 'late', is not present in any of  the material that we investigated and suggests the possibility that development of  sexual identity in adulthood may be more  diverse than previously thought. Generally  accepted truisms such as 'lesbians are born  that way' and 'once a heterosexual always  a heterosexual' may need further consideration.  These three groups gave very different  responses to a variety of questions about  lifestyle, coming out and other variables  which revealed interesting relationships and  areas to be explored and could be important  in terms of understanding aspects of sexual  identity, development and lifestyle.  Both their age and their sexual orientation had resulted in experiences of discrimination and invisibility for these women.  These experiences had occurred largely in  the area of employment. Discrimination occurred when they had trouble finding work  because of age or sexual orientation. Invisibility occurred when they were ignored, or  when they were unable to talk about their  personal lives in the work setting for fear of  being fired or rejected.  Work also was seen as important to their  answers to questions concerning what holds  them back from 'coming out'. Those who  considered themselves to have 'come out'  were predominantly out of or soon to leave  the work force, or were in non-traditiona.  jobs. Those who did not consider themselves  to have 'come out' were held back primarily by professional, work, or family considerations.  It may be that as aging leads to greater  freedom from work commitments, there is  more freedom to 'come out'. With a larger  sample of older and retired lesbians this  would be an important area to pursue.  We also found it interesting that two respondents felt that their sexuality was the  least important topic discussed in the interview. This feeling may reflect an attitude  among segments of the lesbian population  to which our small sample merely hinted.  The fact that many of our respondents  had family with whom they were regularly  in touch but to whom they would not nec  essarily turn for financial or emotional support, is an important issue to be dealt with  among lesbians. If this attitude is representative of the general lesbian population  there are serious implications regarding who  will be providing the support service and  caretaking of lesbians as we age. Indeed, if  those systems are largely homophobic, the  future doesn't look bright.  Despite the small size and homogeneity  of the sample in this study, it is an important contribution to the relatively small  body of knowledge on older lesbians. It supports previous findings on older homosexu-  in the literature such as the refutation  of stereotypes, the identification of areas of  importance and the contention that coming to terms with a gay identity provides  tools which help older homosexuals come to  terms with aging.  The exploratory nature of the study uncovered three main areas for future study:  comparisons of aging lesbians and heterosexual women, comparisons among lesbians  and the development of the general body of  information on the older lesbian population.  It also pointed to issues that need to be  addressed in the lesbian community and the  larger society such as the lack of social support for older lesbians, the perception of  age segregation in the lesbian community,  and the lack of societal services that are inclusive and accepting of gay lifestyles and  needs. There is also a need for education  among people working with the elderly population about gay lifestyles.  Until the largely heterosexist assumptions in the support services for seniors are  truly accepting of gay lifestyles and choices,  there is much work to be done in these areas, both in terms of educating the existing  service providers and setting up services for  older lesbians where the worry and fear of  discrimination and isolation is not an issue,  and where older lesbians can come together  around issues of importance for older lesbians.  The women we interviewed were from  Vancouver, Salt Spring Island, Hornby Island, Victoria, Port Coquitlam, Mission,  Surrey and Richmond. To our knowledge  there is little in terms of networking for  older lesbians in B.C. The need for it has  been expressed, at least by most of the  women in this study.  We take this opportunity to thank the  women who came forward to participate in  this study and hope that it has served useful as a beginning in addressing the issues  identified.  Resources  These are a few of the things that are  happening in the area of aging and lesbians  which are both inspiring and promising. It  is our hope that similar networking and services will emerge here as needs and services  are identified for older lesbians, by older lesbians, and that the community will take a  serious look at the ageism that exists among  us and attempt to address these issues, both  in our own community and the larger society.

KINESIS  sr j Arts  XXX\XXN\XX\\\\XN\XX\XX\XXX\X\^^^  These words of fire create new archetypes  by Susan Knutson  On the evening of April 22, the West  Coast Women and Words Society and the  National Film Board jobed forces to host  the premiere of Studio D's latest production  in a benefit evening for Women and Words.  "Firewords" or "Les Terribles Vivantes"—  there are versions in both French and  English—is a creative documentary which  explores the world of three of Quebec's most  innovative and well-known feminist writers.  The film is in three thirty minute segments, each focusing on the work of one  writer. The sequence opens with Louky  Bersianik who, from her home in a village  community near Montreal, populates the  imaginary with fantastic creatures of feminine wit and power, the Euguelionne and  her companions. Louky explains that she  writes to "create new archetypes" for whom  she has coined the term "les terribles vivantes ... because when women become  visible, they are like giants." With satire  and song she creates a vibrant alternative  to the sterile vision and destructive practice  of patriarchy.  Jovette Marchessault is filmed in her  beautiful rural home, rich with plant and  animal lives, populated with the shamanic  images of Marchessault's own paintings and  giant sculptures, "women rising from the  earth." Hers is a healing which extends from  her personal struggle to be an artist to her  viewing of the planet earth, imagined as "a  kind of angel flying through space."  Marchessault's affirmation of lesbian  identity is one of the ways in which  she works to "make women's history and  women's culture visible." In what is perhaps the single most powerful sequence of  the film, Marchessault's text "Night Cows"  is dramatized by Montreal actress Pol Pel-  letier, setting mask, dance and incantation  against the harsh backdrop of a stony mountain slope.  The film closes with the extraordinarily sophisticated mental landscape of Montreal's Nicole Brossard. A sudden shift to  city lights effectively gestures towards differences within the context of lesbian and  feminist writing. Brossard speaks candidly  about her life as a writer and her commitment to feminist solidarity and struggle.  There is a delightful scene in which Nicole  shares a table at a sidewalk cafe with Louky  Bersianik and fiction writer, Gail Scott. At  one point Nicole rises to erase the chalkboard menu, using the board to diagram  the evolution of spiralling feminist meaning  they were starting to dialogue with English-  Canadian women and women all over the  world—the international women's movement. I proposed the film to Studio D, the  women's studio at the National Film Board,  where I work. They said, "great, but you  have to prove that there is general interest." I said, let me go to the Women and  Words Conference in Vancouver, and I did  and there were 800 women there, of whom  fifty were Quebecoise, and they had an incredible impact. I thought, this is it, this  proves that my idea for a film is ripe. So it  was programmed by Studio D.  Is "Firewords" your first film since  "Not a Love Story"?  Yes.  Where has it premiered?  In English in Halifax and in Montreal,  and in French in Montreal, Quebec City,  Moncton and Paris—Cr£teil, the women's  film festival in Paris. I just got back from  there.  How was "Les Terrible Vivantes" received in Paris?  After the screening we had a discussion,  and one woman was saying how much the  film touched her and started to cry because  it moved her so much. And some women  said "I feel encouraged to test my own creativity, I remember the creativity I have  inside of me when I see this film." I'm so  thrilled when people have that response, because I guess the writers, themselves, did  that for me—they are so inventive, confident, and also angry. They pushed me,  they challenged my film-making to be as exploratory as their writing. They're so different. One of the things I wanted to do  was to celebrate difference. There are many  paths to being a feminist and a writer and  a woman and it's so important not to try  and impose a single path or a narrow path  on each other. I'm quite maniacal about the  need for diversity. Louky Bersianik says in  the film, "caresses are revolutionary and if  there was a third sex I would be trisexual!"  I just love that; I think that's wonderful.  How has the film been received in English Canada?  I'm quite pleased with the response. It  was a real challenge to make the film in  both English and French. The original is in  French, but I was lucky to have Pol Pel-  letier, the actress, who speaks both languages perfectly. We shot all the dramatic  sequences in both French and English, the  texts are translated and are read in English,  and the interviews are subtitled.  I remember the creativity I have inside of me   when I see this film.   within the restricting circle of patriarchal  sense. Initially entirely contained, feminist  meaning steadily expands until it reaches  the border or outside of patriarchal sense,  non-sense. This is a dangerous zone in which  feminist writers work to enlarge the meaning available to women and to disrupt and \  destroy patriarchal power.  Without pulling punches this film celebrates solidarity between women who have  found the courage to create, to be troubling and to confront patriarchal limitation  in language and in the world. It is also a  scholarly exploration of the work of three  important writers and is available from the  NFB in separate segments appropriate for  teachers of Quebecois and Canadian literature.  "Firewords"   director   Dorothy   Todd  Henaut was in attendance at the April 22  screening and spoke about "Firewords".  SUSAN KNUTSON: Can you tell us  about the origin of "Firewords"?  DOROTHY TODD HENAUT: In about  1982 Quebec women were at a point where  Why has Quebec produced such powerful women artists?  Quebec went through enormous change  starting in the early sixties. Nobody wanted  things to stay the way they had been during the period that was called la grand  noirceur—the great black period, when Du-  plessis was in power. Change was seen as a  good. On top of that the Quebec independence movement had a number of strong  women's voices, especially among the poets, including Nicole, who was always there  to read a poem at the Poemes et Chansons de la Resistance, which used to be  benefit evenings for the independence movement with poets and poems and songs. It  was amazing, the impact of poetry and writing on the political consciousness of Quebec.  And women had a voice and an important  one in the whole ferment in Quebec.  Did Jovette and Louky also participate in the independence movement?  When I asked them about Quebec nationalism they simply said that they felt an international connection to women—although  Firewords director Dorothy To<  certainly they are working on their own  language—they are not becoming language-  less.  But Nicole no longer ...  Oh very early she stopped fighting for  that—she stopped, I am sure, way before  '76.  She spoke about this briefly at the  New Poetics Colloquium organized here  by the Kootenay School of Writing.  She said that she considered herself to  be part of an international nation of  women and she was interested in including English in her texts which of  course she does ...  The titles of her books are very often  English, and were very early. Sold Out,  French Kiss, Picture Theory ...  Do you think there is a new kind  of Canadian coming into being, who  speaks both French and English and who  has roots in both cultures?  Yes, and I think the big difference is the  anglophones who are learning French. When  I arrived in Montreal thirty years ago, I  would go into a downtown department store  and speak French, and I would be told to  speak white, "we don't speak French here."  The anglophones who grew up in Montreal  at that time did not learn French. I don't  know who decided it but they had the worst  French teachers in the world. And not only  that—I mean I had a sister-in-law who said  it quite clearly, "there was no way in which  my parents would allow me to learn that  low-class accent." And the difference between the accent of the Quebecois vis-a-vis  the French is precisely the same as between  the English from England and the North  American accent. So here are all these people with low-class North American English  accents saying they're not going to learn the  same accent in French. Forget it! But there  was a real class thing going on.  So the grande noirceur was followed  by the Quiet Revolution and we almost  had an independent Quebec. It seems  enigmatic to me that one of the results  should be a layer of anglophones who  have fallen in love with Quebec, yet thai,  exists, and there are many artists besides yourself who are working in both  French and English. Can you explain?  I think that when the Quiet Revolution  occurred, there was such pride and dynamism and excitement in Quebec that anglophones noticed and wanted to tap some  of that energy. There may even be a part of  it that feels that French energy is a bulwark  against our becoming totally Americanized,  which is a real danger.  What about the women's movement  in Quebec? I know that Quebec is  ahead of France in terms of taking the  worst sexism out of the language and  implementing occupational titles that  are feminine. That indicates that the  women's movement has had a more  powerful impact in Quebec than it has  in France, as you were saying.  I think the women's movement has had  more impact in Quebec than in English  Canada too. There is a backlash happening now, though. It's partially the boys being threatened and partially a generation  of women growing up feeling the world is  their oyster. I don't call it post-feminist, I  don't like that expression. We do not yet  have an available and developed discourse  of women functioning from a position of  strength. I'm not saying that women are  not still oppressed but we have found an  enormous amount of strength. The feminist  movement is not taking the credit for the  advances of women. I think we have to learn  how to do this.  This new discourse, this strong, positive discourse, in fact is the subject of  "Firewords", isn't it? These three poets  are generating it ...  Well they still have the discourse which I  call the indictment of the patriarchy, which  is the old discourse, and which still needs to  be stated, as far as I'm concerned. They still  have that but they also have the very positive sense of their own strengths and their  own vision, so in that sense you might call  them a bridge between the two. The film  is facing towards that new discourse. But  we haven't yet found it, and I'm really interested in having a dialogue with younger  women and seeing what is growing there.  It seems that Quebec has something  to teach, and particularly Quebecois  feminists.  I think so, I think they are really on the  forefront of creating a new kind of world.  * KINESIS ARTS  /^^^^^^^%^^^%%  Lois Simmie  Writing with compassion and humour  by Patricia Maika  Poet Muriel Ruykeser said women's truth  would split the world open. The new birth  of the world through the crack in the rigid  surface of the old will come as women  artists and writers cast off social determinants in search of what is real. Award winning prairie writer Lois Simmie would likely  find this notion pretentious, yet she is an  original and perceptive writer whose work  brims with life and authenticity in contrast  to much of the cliche ridden junk littering  Canadian libraries and bookshelves.  Simmie's work is distinguished by more  than its unswerving truthfulness. It stands  out, as does its author, because of a quality  of compassion. Lois Simmie loves the people she creates. Down and outs, alcoholics,  the mentally handicapped, even manipulative men are fashioned with love, understanding and humour.  Several years ago I read with delight,  recognition and some pain, Simmie's They  Shouldn't Make You Promise That, a  novel accurately describing the breakup of  a marriage and the start of a woman's difficult journey to a new life, a trip well known  to many of us. Now I am to meet the woman  whose work has spoken so personally to me.  Parkview School, Sicamous is one stop  on Lois Simmie's tour reading to elementary school children from her two books  of poems, Auntie Is Knitting a Baby  (1984) and An Armadillo Is Not A Pillow (1986), both Children's Book Centre  choices. The tour, arranged by the National  Book Centre and sponsored by the local  Teacher-Librarian Professional Association,  is the usual hectic round of readings, questions, book signing and interviews. The little towns—Sicamous, Enderby, Ashcroft—  are sleepy, the facilities limited, the weather  warm, the kids restless. And B.C. teachers  are beginning job action.  It Sure Feels Good To Feel This Mean  A small, fair, curly-haired woman in a blue  denim jumper, pink blouse and flat comfortable shoes lugs a box of books up the stairs,  smiles all round, perches on a table. Her poems and comments immediately catch the  attention of kids and adults. She details children's experience as she does women's: accurately and with humour and compassion.  The kids recognise and understand their  own oppression:  "I got the feeling I'm under arrest,/ I'm  writing another arithmetic test;"  ... their black moods: "... it sure feels  good/ To feel this mean;"  ... their loneliness: "I'm a lonely boa  constrictor,/ I'm as sad as the saddest  sack;/ I keep hugging people all the time,/  But nobody hugs me back;"  ... their lack of power: "How do you  say goodbye to a house/ When you're moving forever on Saturday,/ When you've lived  there always—seven years,/ And no matter  what, they won't let you stay."  Simmie's easy, friendly manner and her  lack of condescension produce responses and  questions like:  "Can you write a poem about anything?"  "Do you have a cat?" (she does)  She gets requests for autographs and she  gets confidences: a boy is inventing a new  way to empty the tooth paste tube; a girl  wears unmatched socks. Simmie smiles, encourages, creates a feeling of warmth, acceptance. This is literature? Wow! Everyone  wants to talk, to read, to write a poem.  Later I talk with Lois Simmie over coffee.  We don't have much time. She looks tired. I  feel guilty. We're around the same age; she  is a little younger than I, but fifty is well  past. I want to talk about myself, my life,  my writing. But I have to interview her. She  gives me her full attention, a direct gaze.  I notice the filigree butterfly pendant on a  neck chain: Psyche, the soul, female creativity.  She began to write, she tells me, at thirty-  nine, after she quit drinking. Her short story  "The Night Watchman" is about a houseful of misfits, all alcoholics, who need love,  freedom to grow and live. This story is  like all Simmie's work, compassionate, realistic, funny, hopeful and intensely moving.  A character in her novel, a talented, liberated woman, is devoted to drink and beyond help. We talk about addictions. Another bond between us. She has belonged to  a women's alcoholic anonymous group for  lively and supportive arts community where  she is to be the Saskatoon public library's  next writer-in-residence, a position that  comes with a salary and time to write. She  has considered moving to Victoria to avoid  the prairie winters, but finds that city curiously artificial, unsure of its identity; perhaps an uncomfortable milieu for a writer.  Simmie has read Tillie Olsen's Silences;  the foreground silence of older women is real  for her. I ask what we can do. "Women must  just get on with their writing, must believe  in themselves. They write much better than  men. They have always talked about their  feelings."  But Simmie writes not to prescribe. That  would be "preachy," presumptuous. She describes the world around her; what she sees,  what she knows. She admits her writing  may have autobiographical influences but  stresses that she tries to put herself in the  place of her invented characters and to understand their lives. They become people  she cares about, laughs at, mourns for. This  gift of understanding is what gives her work  its real power; what makes us see ourselves  in her stories and poems. She is awed to  touch another's life, finds it humbling. But  she insists her main function as a writer is  to tell stories and to entertain. I don't  gue with that.  Two more children's books will be out  in the Fall: Oliver's Chickens and Mr.  Gotta Go, inspired by the resident tabby  cat in Vancouver's Sylvia Hotel. Lois Simmie is working on another volume of short  stories, her preferred form, and thinking  about writing a play, first for radio and then  perhaps the theatre. Meanwhile she is having a good time. She is becoming known,  beginning to make money. "It's fun being a  late starter."  She squeezes my hand and gives me another of those direct looks. I hope I meet  her again, and we have time to talk. I'll  tainly read everything she writes because  she speaks to me and for me. If the world is  to survive, it must change; we need to recognize what is real and what is sham. Lois  Simmie, prairie writer, speaks from a universal women's culture. We can trust her to  tell us the truth.  Lois Simmie  fifteen years. She urges me to find one. It's  hard to be solitary and to stay sober. I agree  and promise to look around.  We discuss kids, marriage, men. Simmie's  four kids are grown. She may soon visit a  son working in China. Her artist daughter  Anne Simmie, illustrates her poems, a nice  collaboration. She, herself, is no longer married and cannot imagine why she should  be again. She's happy with the freedom afforded by living alone: "No one would put  up with me. I write when I feel like it, do  what I want."  Silence In The Foreground  Simmie grew up in small prairie towns but  she now lives in Saskatoon, a city with a  Alice Munro is an important influence;  also Margaret Laurence. Simmie, like Laurence, has been accused of immorality, of the  corruption of teenagers who read "Emily",  a touching story of sexual innocence and the  exploitation of a lonely girl. She is angered  by the bigots, fears the zealots, and admires  the irreverent, the slightly zany. British novelist Beryl Bainbridge and southern writer  Lee Smith are favorites.  She is uncomfortable with questions of  nationalism, feminist controversy, and the  role of the writer. I ask if she considers  herself a feminist writer. Like most serious  women writers she resists labeling, immediately senses barriers closing in. "Women  have had a raw deal from day one."  Books By Lois Simmie  They Shouldn't Make You Promise That.

Guest columnist Faith Jones has  considerable experience as a writer and  on small magazine and newspaper pro-  This column is normally used to take a  look at feminist periodicals. I am both a  writer for the alternative press and a typesetter for the real world. Like most feminists, I have my own version of the Ten  Commandments, and inscribed in my mind  below "The Personal is the Political" is  "Form and Content are Indivisible." In this  column, I hope to assist readers of feminist  periodicals understand the ways in which  magazines' appearances affect how we read  The design and production of newspapers and magazines should help the reader  look at a page long enough to read what is  on it. Good design is suitable to the content, interesting and varied though consistent, and offers elements of visual interest.  In general, too much copy and not enough  pictures is the most common problem found  in low-budget publications. Occasionally, in  an attempt to spice themselves up, magazines will crowd too many disparate elements onto a page, tiring readers' eyes before they even reach the type. Confusing  your audience is as big a sin as boring them.  Poverty is probably the biggest barrier  between small mags and good production  values. But good production keeps readers interested and even lends credibility to  the articles. Having said all this, I will now  break my own rule and discuss only the  appearances of my favorite feminist magazines. Some of these magazines are a joy to  look at as well as a joy to read; some of them  I love in spite of how they look.  teaman  power  Woman of Power, a magazine about  feminism and spirituality, has a glossy cover  in colour. I once heard a politico call  Mother Jones "that glossy rag," but to  me 'glossy' is still nothing but a compli-  (Airheart  Co-operative Travel Centre  Deborah Bradley  Ellen Frank  Frances Wasserlein  James Micklewright  Judy Brooksbank  2149 Commercial Drive  Vancouver, B.C. V5N 4B3  (604)251-2282  CompuServe 71470,3502  ment. Woman of Power is attractive on  the newsstand, and the typeface inside is  equally attractive. What's more, the typeface, garamond, is a classic, which gives  the whole magazine a definitely non-flaky  and rather cultured air. I assume this is intentional, since spirituality can be a tricky  topic to discuss matter-of-factly.  This magazine also has a fair bit of  whitespace, which is used effectively as a  design element. For example, rather than  use standard, justified columns, it has  ragged-right columns. This ensures a certain amount of whitespace on the page, because every line is of a different length. It  also avoids the reader distraction that occurs when the words in a line are greatly  stretched or cramped to achieve justified  type. Some pages are 'grey'—all type and  no pictures—but they look fine because of  the whitespace and because they have a consistent structure. Other pages are far from  grey, using big pictures which are grouped  effectively. These pages introduce novelty  into the structure and avoid repetitiveness.  Spare Rib, a British magazine, makes  women's liberation look like rock 'n roll.  The colour on the cover is used for glaring teasers which run over top of the cover  photo. It really looks like a general-interest  magazine, and this theme is consistent with  the design inside. Departments (letters, reviews, events listings) are in thin columns,  while articles are in wide columns, all of  them ragged-right. Spare Rib makes great  odical, but it bears more than a passing resemblance to The New York Review of  Books (not a bad thing in the credibility  department). But there are drawbacks. The  type is times, not one of your more adventurous typefaces. To be more blunt, every  newspaper in North America uses times. On  most pages, the only visual elements ar^  'drop caps', a large letter at the beginning  UI  </>  Rib  bathroom reading: the thin columns particularly impart a sense of urgency and accomplishment which is perfect for short, quick  reads.  The Women's Review of Books uses  the same format for the cover every issue: a  large photo on the left, the first column of a  major article on the right, and a huge 'flag'  (the magazine name) across the top. There's  no mistaking it for any other feminist peri-  of a paragraph. To be honest, the real visual interest in The Women's Review of  Books are the ads.  Broadside has a nice cover format, like  that of Kinesis . Inside, justified columns  in times are divided by wide 'gutters' (the  white line between columns), which puts  some white on the page. Crowded pages are  broken up by small headlines, which are centred over the article. Most papers try to fill  the entire space for a headline, which can  make them look crowded.  Broadside, however, is not afraid of  whitespace. It makes assiduous use of photographs and drawings, but since it is  printed on newsprint, most of them are  pretty muddy. Ink on newsprint invariably  spreads, making Broadside's crisp design  difficult to pull off completely.  Outwrite is a British newspaper with a  focus on women of colour. Once again, the  body of the paper is times, but occasional  shorter pieces are helvetica. A number of  different column-widths are used, and gutters have a thin line down the middle. There  are plenty of pictures. Some of the headlines are 'reversed', that is, white type on  a black background. This is a problem, because Outwrite is on newsprint, and the  black background comes off all over readers'  hands.  There is no whitespace in Outwrite, but  the total visual effect is quite emphatic, almost tabloid-ish. It is interesting that two of  the three British periodicals discussed here  [Spare Rib and Outwrite) use popular-  appeal visuals. North American feminist papers seem to strive towards a more staid  look.  I've saved my favorite for last. It is Lilith,  the Jewish women's magazine. First of all, it  is the only magazine mentioned here which  has glossy paper inside as well as for the  cover. Secondly, the type is palatino. I have  a hard time describing my deep, abiding respect for palatino. Other people feel this  way about Rosa Luxembourg or Martina  Navratilova.  Palatino is a sort of throwback typeface,  intended to look chiselled out of stone, but  it's updated with a strong art deco influence. It's elegantly proportioned: the lower  case letters are small in comparison to the  caps, and the vertical strokes are extremely  bold while the horizontal and curved strokes  are very light. As a typesetter, I have never  tired of palatino, or seen a situation in  which it was an inappropriate type choice.  In short, everyone should use palatino all  the time!  THE JEWISH WOMEN'S MAGAZINE  DiiUi  But to return to Lilith. The three column format has a built-in symmetry, but  because they manage to unite facing pages,  a number of different sizes and shapes of illustrations are possible. One effect which is  expertly carried out are motifs: a large picture appears with the first page of an article, while successive pages of the same article carry a smaller chunk of the picture.  This helps bind page after page together,  while providing variety—an especially useful technique for longer pieces.  Another surprising feature is the use of  all capital letters for display type. 'All-caps'  is notorious for losing reader interest because of their uniformity, but Lilith uses a  variety of weights and sizes to achieve the  complexity of upper-and-lower case. Lilith  also employs a number of typographical  tricks which are too complicated to explain (but in case you know the terminology  they're drop-outs, stretches and shadows),  as well as original variations on standard effects, such as putting short articles in grey  boxes and bleeding the boxes off the edge of  the page. The covers are glossy, heavy paper  and tend to have one colour, used carefully.  These are just a few women's periodicals  to give you an idea of the differences you  might encounter. Now it's up to you to put  the form and content back together. Next  time you pick up a feminist magazine, you  should be able to look at it a little differently.

Ms Svendsend implies that teenaged mothers who,  knowing they will be unable to support  themselves and their babies and who decline  to choose abortion, are being irresponsible.  What I would like to ask is this: who  should be permitted to have children? Only  married couples? Only single women with  lucrative careers? Only the affluent?  The way that our economy is going (particularly in regard to office jobs which traditionally women have fallen back on, but also  in regard to jobs in general) there may not  be employment for the majority of us in the  future (including, perhaps, Ms Svendsend,  who may find herself as superfluous as Crystal and Ani's babies). Does this mean that  we, the ordinary people, must give up our  right to have children? Should only the rich,  who are responsible for the declining number of jobs, be permitted to have families?  She brings up the population problem.  Over-population is, indeed, a problem, but  it is more complex than most people realize.  Perhaps Crystal and Ani will oidy add one  or two children to the population in their  hves. Another family, though supported by  a breadwinner, may add six. A rich family might have only one child but that child  may use up as many resources as one hundred Third World people!  Single moms on social assistance are relatively easy on resources. They don't have  the extra funds to spend on a lot of throw-  away junk.  Galila Svendsend complains that Crystal  and Ani are stealing tax dollars that she  might spend on material things and leisure  activities for herself. Granted, some of the  activities she mentions—buying books, going to the theatre—are ones I can relate to,  but I seriously doubt that the part of her income tax that goes to Welfare is causing her  to be unable to afford these pleasures. There  are so many more destructive uses of our tax  dollars (the nuclear industry, tax breaks to  the very corporations that keep eliminating  jobs, to name two) that she could pick to  complain about.  It's funny how a person who is employed  at any type of job, even if it is one that destroys the environment or destroys the employee's own mental or physical health, is  seen as productive, but someone who takes  on the task of raising a future citizen is seen  as a burden.  If Galila Svendsend never has children of  her own it will be Crystal and Ani's superfluous babies who will be paying taxes  toward her Old Age Pension. The children  will one day have to be responsible for all  of us. Can we not take tribal responsibility  for them? Can we not speak of them as human beings, not as luxuries their mothers  are burdening us with?  I suspect that it is true that teen mothers  may be getting pregnant in the first place  for questionable reasons—perhaps because  they long for children of their own as something real to relate to in this plastic society  that encourages us to value material possessions more than we do people. Bearing and  keeping their babies can be a cry of protest  against a world that denies all of us spiri-  «■  * * THEATRE .• •  Wmk  For the best in Foreign Films  and Independent Quality Films  Non-Sexist, Coffee Bar, Crying Room for parents  with small children  16th and ARBUTUS STREET  Phone 738-6311  $2.50 on Tuesday, $4 students with  valid student cards.  tual and emotional nourishment. We must  give these young women meaningful alternatives before we condemn them for choosing premature motherhood.  Abortion or giving up a child for adoption should always be a woman's free choice.  That's what the pro-choice movement is  all about. I don't believe a woman should  be pressured into abortion for strictly economic reasons. My concept of "pro-choice''  means choosing an abortion only if you do  not want a child at that time, not because  mainstream society perceives mothers and  children as burdens.  Anne Miles  Abuse from  childhood  Kinesis  The article "Lesbian Abuse" by Jane  Smith was timely and long overdue. The  writer certainly touched on a lot of common problems that do occur with probably too much regularity in lesbian relationships and which will continue unless we start  to look at this issue more seriously. One  of the most important contributing factors  that the writer seems to have glided over is  the whole aspect of our upbringing, childhood, and abuses—emotional, physical and  sexual, that plagues one in two women in  our society according to the Canadian government's Badgely Report.  As a lesbian incest survivor, and as one  who has had many troubles in my past relationships, this history of childhood sexual  abuse has been something that has significantly contributed to the abuse that has  been played out in my relationships. And as  is characteristic for many adults who have  been abused in childhood, is that the abuse  has been buried and is not a conscious memory. Therefore many of us unconsciously  pick abusive partners or develop an abusive relationship where sex is a problem,  where honest intimacy other than physical  is a problem, an unknown concept for us  since our levels of trust have been eroded  since childhood by our fathers, stepfathers,  brothers or relatives.  The whole area of feelings, of having  them, of being able to distinguish them and  then to communicate these to our partners  is a major aspect of our poor functioning in  a relationship. This inability to feel and to  communicate these and to recognize those  of our partner only further paralyses us and  keeps us in unhealthy and dependent relationships. It is expected with a history of  abuse then, that the symptoms of power  and inequity, of dependency and unhappi-  ness are common in lesbian relationships.  It is probably again more common than  one would like to think that both partners  in lesbian relationships could share a childhood of abuse and hence years of behaviours  trying to live with such trauma. The end result of women living together with the same  types of unfulfilled needs, of deep seated  fears and trauma is lesbian abuse in relationships.  There needs to be a lot more attention  paid to the realities of survivors of sexual, emotional and physical abuse and their  ways of coping and living in relationships.  I think it is a challenge to the women's  movement, to both straight and gay women  to not run away when the topic of abuse is  discussed. Perhaps we are somewhat guilty  of believing we as women have all the skills,  the pohtical commitment and knowledge  to develop healthier relationships than the  mainstream. And as Jane Smith has said,  we are all products of the patriarchy. Let's  try harder, though, to open up honest, caring discussion on abuse, not just in the here  and now of relationships, but of past abuses.  Being aware that such trauma is common  to women can help all of us to deal with the  pain and common experience we share and  to heal.  Sue Harris  Committee  appointed  that if she is a lesbian whose lover has not  signed a nomination of Committee naming  her, and the lover's family is not in agreement, then she cannot be named committee  in the Supreme Court of B.C. This is not  true.  In December 1986,1 was appointed Committee in court over the objection of my  lover's family, and with no prior nomination  of committee by my lover. This was accomplished because of good friends, good community support and a good woman lawyer.  It was also easier because of the type of  relationship we have and because we were  fairly open about our relationship. I hope  that other women will persevere and also  succeed.
