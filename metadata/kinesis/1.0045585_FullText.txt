SEPTEMBER 1994 o news would toe  better news  \s  We're back, after one of the warmest  summers ever in Vancouver...looking  healthier and a lot less washed out than a  couple of months ago. August started off  slow...News broke late and we went to press  earlier than usual this month (our production schedule has to do with some Pope who  came up with the Western calendar system.)  We called some contacts in Toronto to find  out if August was a slow month out there  too., it was, we were told. Then we called  Montreal and found out Quebec was having  an election in September.  ...you see, for our daily amusement, we  mostly read The Globe and Mail and The  Vancouver Sun or wqtch the national TV  news shows, and from those sources, we  knew that there was some kind of threat to  Canada brewing in Quebec. Good thing  Kinesis has a few friends in Quebec to set us  straight. So there you have it. It is not Separatism that is brewing, but an Election. Our  s tory on page 3 sketchesout what some women  in Quebec are doing to raise issues of concern to women ...unfortunately, things are so  hectic there, we had difficulty reaching many  women for comments. However, most of  the women we talked to were pleased Kinesis  was writing a story on the Quebec  elections. .."Noone seems to care. No progressive paper has really taken up these  issues yet...," said one woman.  On the topic of elections, we have been  watching the elections in Mexico... [read  story on page 10]. As Kinesis goes to press, the  results of the ballot count in Mexico are  coming in...unconfirmed reports put the  rightwingPRI-which has ruled Mexico since  1929, and brought maquiladoras,  transnational corporations and NAFTA into  the lives of women and campasinos [peasants]-back in power. Protests have sprung  up all over the country, and the Zapatistas in  Chiapas [remember the New Year Revolution in Chiapas in our February issue] continue to fight the state's militia.  Meanwhile in Canada [including Quebec, at this point], the federal government's  Social Policy review is due to be released  mid-September. Originally billed as the Liberal government's Action Plan for "improving" social programs-unemployment insurance, retraining, child benefits, childcare,  and transfer payments to provinces for  healthcare, welfare, etc-and by the way, reducing the $40 billion federal budget for  social spending, it could end up being more  of a discussion paper.  The Women's Social Policy Review  Conference that took place in Vancouver in  July [see page 5] is just one of the many many  conferences and campaigns planned by  women's groups across the country to develop a feminist vision of the Canadian social safety net and devise strategies to ensure  the burden of the "reform" doesn't fall heavily on women and children. By the way,  Seenit Beenthere's story [also page 5] is satiri-  cal-theAxman'sWorkfareandKounselling  Centre doesn't really open until later this  month.  Moving along, another federal body has  been in the news lately. Seems the secretive  Canadian Security and Intelligence Service has been really charitable these days,  donating financial, personnel and technical  assistance to white supremacist groups in  Canada. Bet you didn't know CSIS does  more than bug the telephones of feminists,  anti-free trade and anti-racist activists, and  other lowlife left-wing types. Okay, so some  of you did know they were providing assistance to the white supremacist group, the  Heritage Front and the Reform Party. After  the news broke, someone commented in the  Kinesis production room that it's funny [she  didn't mean ha ha!] how the media is jus' so  appalled that a CSIS guy might have been  working for the Reform Party, while noone's  questioning how come the Reform Party's  security gua rds are members of the Heritage  Front.  Meanwhile, rumour has it that the  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

The ongoing support of  VSW donors, as well as the support of many new donors, is crucial to the expansion of VSW's  vital services and programs in the face of continued government cuts to our funding.

Anyway, there has been no comment  from CSIS yet. We, at Kinesis, however, do  know how to get CSIS to talk. In Vancouver,  CSIS is located across the road from the  Anza Club, and if you walk too close to the  building with shaded windows and mini-  cameras crudely placed along the buildings  walls, an electronic CSIS voice will call out:  "Step away from the building!" Try it. But  not alone.  Also in Vancouver, in the past six weeks,  there has been an increase in the organization and recruitment of people into the neo-  Nazi skinhead movement in the downtown core. Apparently, 30 skinheads have  been recruiting street youth with offers of  food, clothing, shelter and money. Recently,  there has been one reported attempted rape  of a woman, and one woman was doused  with lighter fluid and set on fire. First Nations people, people of colour and immigrants of colour have been assaulted. Lesbians and gay men have been harassed, as  have people with physical or mental disabilities. As we go to press, the BC Organization to Fight Racism is calling a public  community forum to address the issue of  hate group organizing and recruitment, as  well as to address the lack of services for  street youth. Kinesis will report on that meeting in an upcoming issue.  Another story we're working on for an  upcoming issue looks at the recently [but to  close to our press deadlines to cover] released BC Task Force Report on Access to  Contraception and Abortion Services. The  report focuses on how to improve education  about, information on, and access to contraceptives and abortion services in BC.  One more update as Kinesis goes to  press. We carry a story on the violent harassment of abortion clinic workers and patients  at Everywoman's Health Centre in Vancouver by anti-choice activists on page 6. We  just heard that the special prosecutor appointed by the BC government to look into  whether the Attorney Ceneral's Office should  proceed with charges against Gordon  Watson, the anti-choice activist in question,  has decided that charges will indeed be laid  against Watson. Watson will appear before  the BC Supreme Court on September 12th on  contempt proceedings and before the Provincial Court of BC on assault charges.  That's pretty much all we have for this  month's As Kinesis Goes To., well, we have  a few minutes before presstime for one last  little scoop. (At least we thought we had the  scoop on it until today.) Judy Rebick will  be co-hosting a television debate show called  Facing Off on CBC News World, beginning  ' September 19that8pm. Her partner in slime  will be Toronto Sun columnist, Claire Hoy (a  boy) with nasty rightwing politics. On the  good side, Hoy is, at least, honest. So if you  have cable TV, tune in on September 19th--  there's something [Rebick] on the tube worth  watching. Don't miss it.  ^ Â£>^4  Wellhereweare...summer'salmostover  and we're back at work. We had a month off  to prepare for the rest of our 20th year. Did  you miss us? We missed you.  Kinesis has three sad goodbyesâtwo of  our most tireless volunteers and long-time  Ed Board members, Gladys We and Faith  Jones, and our advertising and distribution  coordinator, Cythia Low, have decided  they've had enough!...at least for a while.  (We'll give them three months, then they'll  be back.)  Gladys was our very own computer  expert, fix-it gal, and all-around great volunteer. If Gladys couldn't solve our computer  woes with her own bare hands, she usually  was able to find someone who could. We'll  really miss Gladys especially now, because  we can hardly see anything on our computer  monitor, so you can't blame us for any of the  tyyppos. Gladys was always very  optimistic..she had confidence that we  would get the paper done before the deadline passed. And she was always so cheery  and ready to help out on short notice. How  can we not miss her! Happy trails, Gladys.  As for Faith, what can we say except  she hung in for the long haul and now  understandably needs a rest? Faith wrote for  Kinesis, proofed for Kinesis, helped edit for  Kinesis, pasted up Kinesis, helped out at  benefits for Kinesis.. .you get the picture don't  you? Oh, and she also went to school full-  time, full-year, and had time to can dozens  of jars of pears in her spare(?) time. So, now  she's taking a break for a little while. Rest up  Faith and we'll see you soon...we hope.  Our advertising and distribution coordinator Cynthia Low has decided to hitch up  the team (consisting of one dog) and head  out toward the sunset. Yes, Cynthia is leaving us after doing a bang-up job hustling up  some new advertisers for us and keeping the  old ones on board. She's going forth to sell  her wares, which, for those of you who don't  know, are some of the best functional and  durable ceramics around. Best of luck  Cynthia, and thanks again for a tough job  well done. And we'll miss you too, Lizzie.  So, as you've probably already guessed,  We're needing to hire a new advertising  coordinator and distribution coordinator.  The deadline is Tuesday September 6 at 5pm  sharp. Check Bulletin Board, page 22 for  more information regarding these two positions.  Now it's time to welcome the women  who came in to volunteer at Kinesis for the  first (and certainly not the last) time. Welcome to new writers this issue: Seenit  Beenthere, Maria Julie Amestoy, Pascasia  Kabazaire, and Shree Mulay.  Welcome to new production volunteers  Joelle Paton and Leah Ibbiston. Joelle came .  in during the heat of production and did an  excellent job proofreading. Next time, we'll  let her wield an x-acto knife. And Leah was  amazing on PageMaker, whipping of great  ad designs.  And one final thing., .we'll soon be coming out with 20th anniversary postcards,  designed by six women artists in  Canada...Stay tuned for details. And hey,  you can still get an anniversary t-shirt!  Okay, here's our apology for the issue...  The gals from WomenFutures called us to let us know that we printed the wrong price  for their handbook on community economic development, Counting Ourselves In (in  Movement Matters, May 1994). We listed the price our the book as being $13, but in fact it's  only $12 (plus $3 for postage and handling if you want the handbook mailed to you).  They also told us that Counting Ourselves In is now available in French too. If you want  a copy, call WomenFutures at (604) 737-1338, or write to them at 217-1956 WestBroadway,  Vancouver, BC, V6J1Z2.  i   1 binloaig alboui wjriiieg for lKvinesis?    @  1 lb ere s a cleaclline.      (Â§)  "Bui it is Kiaesis..." Â© â¢255-5499<  SEPTEMBER 1994 News  Women and the Quebec elections:  Coalition gears up  by Miche Hill  The date is set, September 12. The provincial election has been called in Quebec and the  race is on. The politicians scramble. The mainstream media churns out scary separatism  tales. Not a word yet about women in Quebec.  What's going on?  Mary Hannenburg of the  Quebec Native Women' Association points  out that most Aboriginal women are not  really involved in the provincial political  process. "I can't speak for all Aboriginal  women, but for many women, it's a wait  and see attitude. We don't know who we  will be dealing with, who we will be negotiating withâ we just have to wait and see  what happens. The federal government  hasn'tbeen too interested in helping women  in the communities deal with the problems  they are facing. Most women won't be participating in the electionâthey aren't letting  voter registration happen on their territo-  ries-and very few women will actually  vote."  Although the focus is on the two front  running parties, the Quebec Liberals and the  Parti Quebecois, not one of the 24 political  parties registered to run candidates in this  provincial election have made women's issues  a major focus so far.  Women's groups, including La Federation des Femmes du Quebec, the Quebec Native Women's Association, Women's Committees from unions along with over 50 NAC  member organizations are forming a coalition  to raise women's issues in the upcoming  Quebec provincial election. As Kinesis goes to  press, the coalition is organanising a press  conference to ensure women's issues and concerns are raised during the campaign.  "We want to know how the parties are  going to address women's issues" says  Raymonde Leblanc, Quebec regional representative of the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC.)  "All the national [Quebec] women's organizations in Quebec will be joining together  in coalition to raise the profile of women's  issues in this campaign." The coalition will be  building on work done by women's groups  during the federal election.  The coalition will be asking the Parties  questions on women's employment, the  economy and social issues, as well as on immigrant women's rights, childcare, and funding  to women's groups.They will also be releasing  a paper on women's poverty in the next few  days.  The need for the women's movement in  Quebec, as in other provinces to mobilize  around the issue of women's poverty, unemployment and social programs is critical.  "All the  national [Quebec]  women's organizations  in Quebec  will be joining together  in coalition  to raise the profile  of women's issues  in this campaign."  - Raymonde Leblanc -  Unemployment in Quebec is at record  levels, and women tend to be hit hardest.  "The real unemployment rate is 22 percent, and in some areas, it is much worse,"  says Leblanc.  Shree Mulay of Montreal's South Asian  Women's Centre says that the employment  situation for immigrant women, especially  women of colour^ is in fact much worse.  "A lot of jobs have been lost, in the  garment industry for example, has had a direct impact on immigrant women," says  Mulay.  "We are asking for some basic changes,  such as raising the minimum wage." Mulay  says this is the kind of concrete solution they  know the government can introduce without  major legislative changes, to help address the  economic crunch women are facing.  So far most of the converage on the election by the English mainstream media has  focussed on the sovereignly question, even  though both major parties [the Parti Quebecois  and the Liberals] have attempted to shift the  focus of the campaign towards each party's  economic plans for the province.  Leblanc and Mulay agree that focusing  only on the sovereignty issue is simplifiying  matters. "Poverty is the main issue for women  in Quebec. Jobs, the economy and social programs, it's all connected", said Leblanc.  While many of the women's groups in  the Coalition are generally supportive of self-  determination for Quebec, Mulay says  many immigrant groups and individuals are  concerned that the PQ has not demonstrated a  clear commitment to protecting the rights of  immigrants in an independant Quebec.  "ImmigrantwomenseethePQasathreat-  -whether that's true or not-that's the general  attitude," says Mulay "They're worried about  what will happen, concerned about the free  movement of people across the borders [between Quebec and Canada].  "But immigrants in Quebec are also very  disilussioned with the Liberals. They [the Liberals] haven't come through with their election promises and people aren't happy. Where  are the jobs? Immigrant women are unemployed in greater numbers-the job loss in the  garment industry has had a greater impact  on immigrant women."  Since the Free Trade Agreement with  the US came into effect, the garment industry , which has been a major employer of  immigrantwomen, has lost 80,000 jobs"But  , when push comes to shove, [immigrants]  will probably vote Liberal because they are  so afraid of the PQ."  However, Mulay says most immigrant  women's organizations, such as the South  Asian Women's Centre, will be participating in the non-partisan Quebec Women's  Coalition to ensure the concerns of immigrants and of women in general are placed  on the table during the campaign.  "We had some pretty good forums and  debates on women's issues in the federal  election, and this [press conference] will be  our first attempt to spark discussion on  these issues during the provincial election."  says Mulay. "We will, for example, be asking individual candidates to sign a form  supporting a pay equity law."  The Coalition's press conference is the  first step in what they see as long term  organizing. The coalition is also planning a  women's march on Quebec city, whatever  the results of the election, in the Spring.  Miche Hill is a Mi 'kmak volunteer writer  for Kinesis, with roots in Quebec.  SEPTEMBER 1994 News  Feminist institute at SFU:  Coming down the hill  The Feminist Institute for Studies on  Law and Society wa s born on Burnaby mountain, within the remote concrete maze of  Simon Fraser University. Since 1989, the  organization has mainly served its academic  constituency: feminist women and men  working in university criminology and law  faculties.  But this September, the Feminist Institute will travel down the mountain for a free,  day-long public event, the first move in its  goal of linking community and academic  activists.  "The tradition has been that the university comes down the hill and bestows information or 'knowledge' on the community,"  says Institute director, Karlene Faith. "The  new tradition should be that the community  goes up the hill and makes demands of the  university."  The September 17th symposiumâSocial and Legal Issues onFeministHorizonsâ  will highlight lawyer Anita Braha speaking  on lesbians and the law. It also features  presentations on male survivors of childhood sexual abuse (studentKathleen Burke);  policy issues related to pregnant women  and mothers who use illicit drugs and alcohol (student Susan Boyd); First Nations  women and self-determination (Gloria  Nicolson of the Professional Native Women's Association); and women and psychiatry (student Jackie Coates).  Faith, who teaches in SFU's criminology faculty and recently wrote the award-  winning book, Unruly Women: The Politics of  Confinement & Resistance (Press Gang Publishers), is passionate about the need for  students and teachers to engage with community issues-and for grassroots feminists  to exercise "their entitlement" to the university's resources.  "Within the community, there are  antagonisms towards the university that are  deserved," says Faith. "Universities can be  elitist and heavily competitive. Tuition costs  are rising and there is declining support for  mature students, who are primarily single  mothers. And some university people may  be very limited in their life experience or  confined by their discipline. But universities  are a tremendous resource for making all  sorts of connections.  "And while we can't allow the university to detach itself from social reality, we  have to remember that the university is also  reality, a convergence of realities.  "Classisa huge issuein community and  university relations. There are assumptions  made about who is at university, yet the  student population is very heterogenous.  Among the students I work with [in criminology], the majority are young feminists or  people who represent some minority group.  Issues of class and homophobia, for example, are fundamental to what we do."  The Feminist Institute was founded in  1989 by six women at the SFU School of  Criminology. (Criminology is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from sociology, psychology, legal studies and the humanities in  general.) The founders wanted a means to  focus on feminist research on socio-legal  issues: the intersections between women's  experience, and the so-called justice system.  "There isn't very much in women's lives  that isn't bound up with socio-legal processes," says Faith. "So many fundamental  women's issuesâpoverty, discrimination,  single parenthoodâare rampant within  women's prisons, for example. Those issues  are all being litigated, in some way or other.  Women lawyers and others are bringing  them into the courts to try to change laws  and to change social policies.  "The founders of the Feminist Institute  wanted more connections with community  activists and more contact with other university women in North America. We were  doing feminist teaching and researching,  V     /  j_   Introducing Amplesize Park's  A^Â»   1  own line of clothing  \^L /  New hours:  fel  Mon, Tues, Thurs 11 -6  Fri 11-7  Sat 10:30-4:30  /Â»  Closed Wed & Sun  i      Quality consignment  \    clothing  ~  1    Size 14... plus  \S0  1        Amplesize Park has moved to:  \^  |7         1969 Commercial Dr.  \  V           Vancouver, B.C.  \  Sarah-Jane (604) 251-6634  and it was important to build on the strengths  of each other's work."

The September event, says Faith "is a  chance for women in the community to gain  more clarity about issues, or discover new  questions, or find new ways of looking at the  work you're doing. Or it might just be 'a  reprieve' from the hard work"âa chance to  be informed and stimulated. "There won't  be any strings attached to attending."

SEPTEMBER 1994 News  Social policy review conference:  Women  set agenda  by Jackie Brown  About 200 women from throughout  British Columbia turned out for the Women's Social Policy Review Coalition conference on the Liberal government's plans to  overhaul Canada's social programs, and to  defining a feminist agenda for social policy  review.  Held June 22-24 in Vancouver, the conference brought togther a number of women's and anti-poverty groups and activists  who shared ideas and strategies for ensuring  Canada's social safety network remains intact and is beneficial to all women.  The conference featured workshops on  education and youth; Native self government; UIC, training and employment;  women and pensions; the feminization of  migration; women and poverty; and  childcare and domestic workers. Workshops  explored existing social policies and programs and changes needed to make them  more responsive and accessible to women.  Strategy sessions focused on community education, activism and lobbying.  Presenters included: Sunera Thobani,  president of the National Action Committee  on the Status of Women (NAC); Goo H-  zew'h,also known as Gloria M. M. George,  a Wetsuwet-en hereditary member; Rose  Brown, an organizer with End Legislated  Poverty (ELP); Alison Sawyer, a lawyer and  member of the Gender Issues committee of  the Canadian Council of Refugees; Alicia  Mercurio, a 30-year activist in the area of  adult educarionand human rights, and Nora  Lagunzad, a founding member of the Vancouver Committee for Domestic Workers  and Caregivers Rights (VCDWCR).  Cenen Bagon of the VCDWCR (one of  the conference's organizers) said organizers  were pleased with the diversity of women  who attended, especially considering there  was only about a month to organize the  event.  "This conference was designed to organize a response from women about the  social policy review and decide what kind of  vision we want for social programs," said  Bagon. "What I saw was a lot of women who  are not satisfied with the current system.  Instead of cutbacks, there need to be improvements so that the system responds  better to the needs of different women."  The Coalition's next action is a weekend  protest at the end of October. A number of  women's groups will create banners depicting social policy changes and which will be  displayed around thecity. A march and rally  will take place on the Saturday. (Time and  place haven't been finalized). The Coalition  is also tying into a national campaign sponsored by NAC which includes a social policy  conference to be held in Saskatchewan from  September 30 to October 2.  The Women's SocialPolicy Review Coalition is a network of women and women's  groups committed to working for social programs that will benefit women. Member  groups include: Women and Work, Vancouver Status of Women, South Asian Women's  Take Back the Night  Take Back the Night first took place as a coordinated national women-only  demonstration in Canada in 1981 when the Canadian Association of Sexual Assaul  Centres organized to protest male violence, particularly in the street. Thirteen years  later, women's groups have organized Take Back the Night 1994 to be held in many  cities across the country on Thursday, September 22nd. This year a national roar o  women's voices will be heard as we take to the streets simultaneously throughou  Canada to celebrate our victories, to experience the strength of women coming togethe  in conscious action with and for each other and to demand continued changes to the  status of all women. All womenare encouraged to join together on September 22nd anc  Take Back The Night. (Pictured above is a scene from Vancouver's Take Back the Nigh  rally 1993.)

The Axman cometh:  Tears, jears greet Centre  by Seenit Beenthere  Under drizzling skies and the watchful eye of the Privatization Squad, federal  Human Resources Development Minister  Lloyd Axman cut a ribbon and tearfully  declared the opening of the high-tech  Workfare'nKounsellingKommunity Centre in Gritville, British Columbia.  The centre, privately managed by the  WorkingLearningKaringCorp. of Alabama  (WKKC), is a prototype of halls to beestab-  lished nation-wide. The WKKC replaces  unemployment insurance and income assistance programs, whose passive approach was abandoned for the Grit's "get  off your loaf" strategy.  Friday's festivities marked the  culminatiion of efforts to revise, reform  and renew Canada's outmoded and overburdened social safety net.  The Liberals pulled out all the stops,  contracting out hundreds of part-time jobs  as caterers, parade marshals and kazoo  blowers to members of the town's flexible  labour force.  On the podium, Axman wept openly as  he described his ministry's achievements.  "Working, learning and caring are cornerstones of our new vision of social security," sobbed Axman. "We've removed disincentives, empowered individuals through  job training and small business loans, and  targetted the needy.  "We've saved the taxpayers billions by  eliminating wasteful universal programs.  And we've pledged, through our Guaranteed Annual Income, that no one will sink too  too utterly low.  "As a nation, we can now take on the  globalized economy. To each Canadian I say:  make economic restructuring and the jobless  recovery work for you!"  The WKKC, a fluorescent green low-rise  near the GudBuyBuy Mall, will employ up to  15 home-based teleworkers. Clients and  employers will use state-of-the-art interactive computers to access the centre's training,  hiring and life skills services.  The mayor of Gritville, Conrad Paste,  praised Ottawa's move to decentralize government operations and promote community control.  "This beautiful building is just the beginning for Gritville," declared Paste. "Social services used to drag this town down:  high taxes, welfare fraud, stay-at-home  layabouts. The WKKC and the philosophy  it represents are good for business and  what's good for business is good for  Gritville."  The opening was not without controversy. On a level playing field opposite the  WKKC, 3 million demonstators from the  Coalition for Better Not Less waved placards, hurled water balloons and chanted  slogans.  Quickly drying his cheeks, Axman  lashed out at his critics.  "There is a job to be done, a deficit to  tackle,and international capital to appease,"  shouted Axman in a moment of rare candour. "EPF, CAP, NAFTA, TNCâit's just  alphabet soup to the average Canuck. Let's  not bore each other with soup.  "And this incessant whining about  "legislated poverty" or "redistributed aims"  clearly shows who the special interest  groups really are: cheaters and Nervous  Nellies too devious and dependent to stand  on their own two feet."  Axman left the WKKC early after the  crowd surged across the street. The Privatization Squad maintained control during  a performance by the Harmonization  Brothers, who belted out stirring renditions of "You Say Clawback, I Say Tax  Back, Let's Call The Whole Thing Off" and  "I'm a SAP for the IMF and I Love It."  But the Devolution Dance troupe's  ballet "Slaying the Child Poverty Dragon"  was halted when the mob stormed the  stage.  The dragon was hospitalized for minor bruises. An Axman aide was charged  with assault but later released after claiming he had mistaken the dragon for a protester^   Seenit Beenthere is a freelance writer living  in Gritville who refuses to be bored by soup.  SEPTEMBER 1994 What's News  by Shannon e. Ash  and Theresa McCarthy  Employment  equity act in Ontario  Ontario's EmploymentEquity Act will  be proclaimed by Ontario's legislature on  September 1. The Act was the target of a  rightwing backlash in the province and  country-wide when it was first introduced  as a bill last winter. Among groups lobbying against the legislation was the Canadian  Federation of Independent Business [see  Kinesis, Feb. 1994].  The Act designates four groups  (women, "visible minorities," Aboriginal  people, and people with disabilities) for  equity action. At present, the legislation  exempts "small employers" (defined as less  than 10 employees for the private sector and  less than 50 for the public sector) from the  effects of this legislation. Therefore, unfair  hiring practices can continue to occur in  these workplaces.  Another flaw in the legislation is that  there are few mechanisms specified or little  incentive for employers to remove hidden  workplace barriers from employment or  promotion within organizations. It is expected that the onus for challenging employers or fighting for removal of barriers  may fall on employees.  However, the legislation has been described by some community activists as a  starting point for equity in the workplace in  Ontario.  Massive water  diversion in BC  The Kemano Completion Project (or  Kemano 2) is the second stage of a massive  water diversionprojectby Alcan Aluminum  near Kitimat, British Columbia, between  the central interior and the northern coast.  First Nations peoples, fishers' groups, and  environmentalists are among those opposing the project.  In the first phase in 1952, Alcan dammed  the Nechako River at its source and diverted  the water to an electrical generating facility  at Kemano that powered aluminum smelting near Kitimat.  The Cheslatta Carrier nation was forcibly relocated to make way for the project,  and their traditional territories flooded.  "The first time we saw an Indian agent  was in 1952," says current Cheslatta chief  Marvin Charlie. The agent came to tell them  that their land, which had never been ceded,  would be flooded and they must negotiate  a surrender. The people were self-sufficient  but after relocation were dependent on  welfare and faced social decline.  The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council is  opposing Kemano 2, which would include  construction of a mountain tunnel and a  new water release structure to control the  massive reduction of water flows into the  Nechako River. Alcan would sellthehydro-  electricity created to the province and possibly the United States.  Kemano 2 will reduce the flow of the  Nechako by 87 percent of its original flows.  The Nachako's flow has already been reduced by 33 percent by Kemano 1. Among  negative impacts of the reduced flow would  be a major decline in the salmon fishery.  Twenty-three percent of the Fraser River's  sockeye production depends directly on the  Nechako. More than half the BC commercial salmon catch originates in the Fraser  watershed, and 65 percent of BC First Nations bands depend on the Fraser and  Kemano fisheries. There is already a decline  of Pacific salmon stocks originating in the  US.  A closed-door agreement between the  provincial and federal governments and  Alcan in 1987 allowed Alcan to proceed with  Kemano 2. The Department of Fisheries and  Oceans refused to release documents by its  scientists assessing Kemano's impact, and  put a gag order on the scientists, whichâat  least in one caseâhas only recently been  lifted. One scientist, Dr. Mundie, said his  research clearly indicated Kemano 2 carried  a high risk for fish.  In October 1990, the Conservative cabinet, under Brian Mulroney, exempted  Kemano 2 from an environmental review; in  1993, a Commons-Senate committee condemned the exemption as unconstitutional,  and illegal.  In response to the opposition to Kemano  2, the BC Public Utilities Commission is  holding a public review. However, the review cannot look at impacts outside the  Nechako and Kemano watersheds, and no  major changes can be made to the project.  Current federal fisheries minister Brian Tobin  has said the 1987 agreement is binding and  the project cannot be stopped.  The Carrier-Sekani Tribal Council is rejecting the public hearings as a sham, and is  calling for an inquiry into the original 1952  agreement, the 1987agreement, and the 1990  exemption. Protests were held outside the  public hearings in Vancouver this summer.

Attacks escalate  at abortion clinic  The Everywoman's Health Centre Society in Vancouver is calling on the BC government (again) to ensure better enforcement of  the injunction against anti-choice protesters  afteraVancouveranti-choice activist shoved  a camera into the face of a clinic worker who  was filming him.  Last month, George Watson assaulted  one of the abortion clinic's security workers,  Margaret Panton. Vancouver police are recommending Watson be charged with the  assault of Panton. The Ministry of the Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to determine whether charges will be  laid.  Everywoman's Health Centre and the  BC Coalition of Abortion Clinics (BCCAC)  say this incident could mark the beginning  of the kind of violent action being taken  against abortion providers in the US. The  assault on Panton on August 3rd follows  hard on the heels of the July 29 murders of  pro-choice doctors in Florida. Watson has  been compared by US psychologists with  Paul Hill, a prominent anti-abortion activist  in the United States, who has been charged  with the murder of a doctor and his escort  outside a Pensacola, Florida abortion clinic.  Kim Zander, a spokesperson for  Everywoman's Clinic, says, "In Toronto, Dr.  Morgentaler's clinic was bombed and abortion providers throughout the country are  targeted, harassed and threatened. We fear  that this violence will escalate. Knowing all  of this in advance, are we going to let more  violence happen here?"  According to Jennifer Whiteside, spokesperson for the BCCAC, "Violence against  abortion providers and pro-choice activists  has not abated, but press coverage has. The  big blockades, which received more sensational media coverage, have become less  common. However, more subtle and potentially dangerous actions have taken their  place. These activities continue largely without being prosecuted by the police or criticized by the press."  Meanwhile, Vancouver Police's Community liason officer, Anne Drennan, says  the police "do give the clinic special attention. We treat their problems with all due  respect and consider them to be potentially  serious, always," but in order for the police  to lay more charges against protesters, the  clinic must "spell out what their complaints  are."  According to Kim Zander, "the threat of  death now hangs over all abortion providers, including in this city." The centre has  approached the Attorney General's office  and is asking for a meeting with police supervisors to increase protection of the centre, its workers, and clients.  Everywoman's Health Centre and the  BCCAC are also demanding that "the police  and govenment authorities acknowledge [the  US] murders as part of an organized continent-wide attack against abortion providers, clinics, staff and clients and pro-choice  activists."  Prenatal  nutritionprogram  The Fed era 1 Govenment announced last  month the creation of the Canada Prenatal  NutritionProgram (CPNP),directed towards  low-income pregnantwomen. The Program,  which will receive $21.5 million a year over  four years, is intended to provide nutrition  counselling, inter-agency referral, food supplements, education, and support and counselling on smoking, substance abuse, family  violence, and stress. The program targets  pregnant women who are most likely to  have unhealthy babies that would also be at  high risk due to poor health and malnutrition of the mother.  The program is to be implemented and  delivered in partnership with the provinces  and territories through the federal government's Community Action Program for  Children and through the Brighter Futures  First Nations and Inuit component. It will  build on or expand existing prenatal health  programs.  Female circumcision  refugee accepted  A Somali woman was granted refugee  status in the first case in Canada of a woman  being granted refugee status because of fear  of genital mutilation.  Khadra Hassan Farrah did not want to  take her daughter back to Somalia where she  would undergo the ritual: "I was prepared  toleave my daughter here foradoptionif my  case was rejected. I couldn't take her back."  She said many Somali women are forced  to undergo the procedure, which involves  cutting the external female sexual organs  away and sewing the opening shut, except  for a small hole for urination. "They did it to  me and I didn't want my daughter to go  through the same thing."  Following repeated demands from and  concerted lobby campaigns by women's  groups such as the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, Canada  finally began accepting refugee claims in  early 1993 from women who say they are  being persecuted because of their gender.  New housing in BC  A new program to provide affordable  housing in British Columbia was announced  on June 30 by provincial Housing Minister  Joan Smallwood. "Homes BC" will have  four components to provide average and  low-income BC residents with adequate and  affordable housing. Homeless/At Risk  Housing is designed to provide housing for  those who find it most difficult to get safe  and affordable housing: young single mothers, women and children leaving transition  houses, inner-city youth, and people with  alcohol and drug dependencies or mental  illness.  Non-profit housing will assist non-profit  sponsors to build housing for low and moderate-income renters; a minimum of 60 per  cent of the units will be low-income. Priority  will be given to mixed-income projects designed for families with children and people  with disabilities.  These two components are planned to  provide 900 affordable housing rental and  co-op units in 1994/95.  New Options for Home Ownership is  an initiative to create affordable forms of  home ownership such as equity co-ops. Priority will be given to current residents of  social housing.  TheCommunity Housing Initiativewill  provide $1.6 million in grants for projects  providing advocacy, public education, and  new housing-related services by community housing organizations.  The BC government has also recently  amended the Residential Tenancy Act to  provide more protection for the 450,000 tenant households in BC.  UN releases  population report  The United Nations has released a report to thelnternarionalConference onPopu-  lation and Development (ICPD), which will  take place in Cairo September 5 to 13. The  report promotes the education and empowerment of women, and access to voluntary  family planning as methods to limit population growth.

SEPTEMBER 1994 What's News  The report also stresses women's right to  reproductive choice, stating, "Evidence is accumulating that free and equal access to health  care, family planning and education is .not  only desirable in itself but a practical contribution to the success of wider objectives,  including environmental protection and economic development." An earlier report by  Unicef demonstrated that there is a direct  correlation between women attending primary and high school and reduced  childbearing.  The Vatican and some Islamic authorities have criticized the report. The Roman  Catholic hierarchy is vigorously opposing  the positions of some delegate governments,  particularly the United States, which support  access to abortion and rights to "reproductive and sexual health." "Sexual health," argues the Vatican, could include gay and lesbian rights.  Al Azhar University in Cairo, a centre of  Islamic learning, and the government of Iran  have said parts of the preparatory documents  offend Islam.  At the ICPD prepa ra tory meeting in New  York in April [see story page 9], Vatican pressure convinced the delegations of ten countries to oppose language in conference documents referring to reproductive health, reproductive education for adolescents, and  safe motherhood. Although a minority, because the meeting operated by consensus,  this language ended up bracketed in the preparatory documentâmeaning it will have to  be discussed again at the conference itself  and won't be taken as a given starting point.  In the Philippines, the Roman Catholic  Church held a protest of 200,000 people to  oppose the government's birth control programâcounselling and free contraceptionâ  and to demand a boycott of the ICPD. Students from Catholic schools who attended  said they had been ordered to do so.  AIDS in the world  The education of women has been identified by the World Bank as one of the most  important factors in improving health in developing countries. And marginalized groups  need basic human rights before they can  defend themselves against AIDS, according  to the director of the International AIDS Centre at the Harvard School of Public Health,  Jonathan Mann.  People who belong to groups that are  "discriminated against, marginalized..and  excluded from society"âwomen, ethnic minorities, and gay menâare most at risk for  HIV infection. Mann, speaking at the 10th  International Conference on AIDS in Tokyo,  Japan, said drug users and prostitutes in  barbara findlay  B.A. M.A. LIB  is delighted to announce  that she is now practising I  with the law firm of  Smith and Hughes  321-1525 Robson St.  Vancouver  phone 683-4176  Smith and Hughes offer a full range of  le?al services to the lesbian, gay and  bisexual communities of Vancouver.  Initial consultations are without charge.  Western Europe are harassed by police,  interfering with their ability to take part in  AIDS-prevention programs. Lack of access  to health care in the United States means  low income people are vulnerable to infection and receive poor care if ill or infected  with HIV. And in many countries, women  are beaten if they refuse unwanted intercourse with an infected partner, and have  no legal protection.  Garment workers  win fight  Workers in a garment factory in Dhaka,  Bangladesh, succeeded in winning the payment of overdue wages. The workers of  Flint Garments, who are almost all women,  demanded payment of three months overdue wages and five months overtime pay in  December 1993.  In response, men were hired to assault  them, and ten workers were injured. Workers filed a police report and pressured the  police into arresting the thugs. The workers  then began a strike, sit-in and blockade to  demand payment of their overdue wages  and to protest against the violence directed  against them. They also sent written complaints to the Labour Ministry and the Garment Owners' Association.  After two meetings between the owners, workers and government did not resolve the situation, the owners gained a  court order to remove goods for shipping.  Women workers lay in front of the gate to  prevent entry and police were unable to  recover the goods.  At a third meeting, the factory owners  finally agreed to pay the outstanding wages  in installments, and the workers have since  received the first payment. The owners accepted full responsibility for the injured  workers. A victory procession was held on  January 3.  Feminist writer  faces death threat  Taslima Nasreen, a feminist writer in  Bangladesh, hasbeen threatened withdeath  by some Muslim fundamentalists for speaking out against the oppression of women.  Nasreen recently published a book,  Lajia (Shame), about a Hindu family in  Bangladesh being persecuted by fundamentalist Muslims. The government banned the  book, which sold 50,000 copies, for "creating misunderstanding between communities."

On June 4, the government of Bangladesh brought criminal charges against  Nasreen for insulting the Muslim religion,  for which the maximum penalty is two years  in prison. About 10,000 fundamentalists rallied in Dhakar, the capital, demanding the  death penalty for'Nasreen and other "blasphemers." One Muslim cleric offered a  bounty to anyone who kills her. [The bounty  has apparently since been withdrawn.]  Nasreen went into hiding in June, but  has since appeared in Sweden, where she  accepted an award. She has said that her  statements about the Koran had been taken  out of context, but she will continue to speak  out about the condition of women: "Everywhere I look I see women being mistreated  and their oppression being justified in the  name of religion. Is it not my moral responsibility to protest?" She cites religious courts  which pronounce extreme sentences, including death, on women breaking Islamic law,  as interpreted by fundamentalists; these sentences are illegal in Bangladesh but the la w is  not enforced.  Lesbian mom  wins custody  A US woman has won an appeal of a  Virginia court decision which had removed  her three year-old son from her custody.  A state appeals court overruled the 1993  decision by a US Judge, who determined  Sharon Bottoms was an unfit mother because she and her lover, who lived together,  engaged in oral sex, which is a crime under  Virginia law. A number of US states have  " sodomy" laws which prohibit certain sexual  acts, even between consenting adults in private.  The Virginia Courts of Appeals panel,  in a three-to-zero decision, ruled that "private sexual conduct, even if illegal, does not  crea tea presumptionofunfitness."The panel  DR.

Only in custody  disputes involving two parents can the court  decide who is "better;" in disputes between  a parent and a third party (such as a grandmother), it must be proven that continuing  parental custody would be extremely harmful to the child:  Although Bottoms is "really happy"  about the decision, her son may not return to  her home for up to two years, pending her  mother's appeal to the Virginia Supreme  Court to reverse the decision.

Inquiry at  UBC  Women at the University of British Columbia who lay complaints and pursue formal grievances dealing with discriminatory  practices rangingfrom racism to biased evaluations and sexual harassment by faculty in  UBC's Political Science Department are calling for support from the wider community.  UBC's Political Science Department has  apparentlybeguna misinformation campaign  designed to discredit the students who have  complained about inappropriate conduct  among the faculty towards students. Media  reports that cite Don Blake, the head of the  Political Science Department, contain  "sanitized" departmental versions of complaints and erroneously state that these versions are the complaints themselves. The de-  partmenthasalsomisrepresentedthenumber  of students involved in complaints and the  duration of time over which the Faculty of  Graduate Studies has received complaints.  The Graduate Student Society at UBC  will attempt to monitor the proceedings of an  inquiry beginning with the as-yet-ignored  issue of what rights students have to protection in the present situation. Several students  say they have already suffered penalties or  received veiled threats formaking complaints.  The inquiry was called by Dean Marchak  and Dean Grace and announced in the form  of a press release from Media Relations UBC.  The university lawyer Bertie McClaine is  responsible for appointing a  commissioner(s) for the inquiry and drawing up the Terms of Reference.  Support for women students being requested includes that women: request information about the inquiry from the University Media Relations Office and the Faculty of Graduate Studies; request information from the Minister Responsible for Skills  and Training and Higher Education; request an interview with Don Blake, head of  the Department of Political Science about  the misinformation issued by him; publish  excerpts from student complaint letters and  memos which are available upon request.

UN postcard  campaign  The March on the United Nations in  New York on June 26 was the first step in  demanding worldwide human rights for all  gay people.  The UN Postcard Campaign is petitioning theUnited Nations to demand equal  right for all lesbians and gay people. They  want the UN to amend Article 2 of the  Universal dDclaration of Human Rights to  include the words "sexual orientation."  Their goal is to deliver to the UN  1,000,000 postcards during the UN's session this fall.  The UN Postcard Campaign supports  the human rights of all the world's people,  including its gay, lesbian and bisexual citizens. With your help, the UN Postcard  Campaign could get them to do this.

European women  and poverty  The Women's Committee of the European Parliament adopted a report in February showing recent statistics that 50 million  people are living in poverty within the European Union. This is about 15 percent of  Europe's population.  In all member states, single parents and  the elderly are amongst the most vulnerable  groups, of which women are estimated to  make up about 80 percent. The report states  that social exclusion is mainly due to three  factors: development on the labour market  (unemployment, atypical work, part-time  work); changes in family structures (such as  divorce, single parenthood, etc); and absence of adequate policies at national and  European levels to deal with these developments, such as the financial dependency of  women, and the fact that benefits are in  general linked to the previous job held.  The Women's Committee resolutions  makea number of recommendations: a minimum income; a special European Women's  Movement Programme for women in areas  of social tension within the European Union;  an information campaign on the feminization  of poverty; more gender specific statistics on  women; and an annual Poverty report by the  European Commission.  The European Commission is also urged  to take measures in favour of refuge centres  for homeless women and victims of violence  and to hold consultations with non-governmental organizations and grassroots women  in the process of drafting programmes and  projects.  The Groner Report is available from  national European Parliament offices in Europe.  Fighting toxic  chemicals in Mexico  Solidarity workers and Mujer a Mujer  have joined with the Mexican Maquila  Women Workers Network in protesting  health and environmental problems caused  by the harmful use and disposal of toxic  chemicals by multinational corporations in  the Mexican maquiladora region. In response  to corporate and governmental demands  that the multinationals lower their standards to "compete with Mexican workers,"  they are supporting the efforts of Mexican  workers to raise standards.  On June 27, the Mexican Maquila  Women Workers Network organised a Day  of Action Against Toxic Chemicals in a  number of cities along the Mexican/US border. In Canada, Solidarity Works and Mujer  a Mujer (Woman to Woman) called on labour, women's and environmental groups,  to send taxes to the Mexican and Canadian  governments demanding strict enforcement  of healthand safety andenvironemntal standards in the maquila.

The workshops will be held in Vancouver, Kamloops  and Nanaimo.  WBW says sectoral bargaining is one  strategy to improve working conditions,  wages, and benefits for women by making it  easier for women to unionize. Under the  current labour legislation and anti-worker  climate, women in service sector jobs or in  small workplaces find it almost impossible  to organize collectively.  WBW says that if sectoral bargaining  were allowed, women workers could would  be able to bargain collectively by sectorâ  such as banking or retailârather than in a  small group or one-on-one with their employers. Sectoral bargaining could particularly benefit women in non-standard jobsâ  part-time, short-term, contract and temporary workâand those working in isolated  workplaces, such as domestic workers and  home workers.  WBW's hands-on workshops are in-  . tended to provide women with a chance to  evaluate sectoral bargaining as a strategy for  advance women's economic status.  The workshops will be held:  â¢In Vancouver: Thursday, September 8  in Room L3, Brittania Community Centre,  1661 Napier St.  â¢In Kamloops: Monday, September 12  in Room 101N, Cottonwood Centre, 750  Cottonwood Ave.  â¢In Nanaimo: Tuesday, September 20  at the Nanaimo Women's Resource Centre,  #219-285 Prideaux St.  All three workshops are from 7-9:30 pm  and childcare subsidies are available at the  workshops.

The ICPD will have two concurrent forumsâone for government representatives from  UN member countries and another for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Several preparatory committee (PrepCom) meetings were  held leading up to the Cairo conference. Out of  those meetings came a 16-chapter document laying out the framework for debate and discussion  for the ICPD.  Shree Mulay attended an ICPD PrepCom  meeting in April in New York. She will be attending the NGO forum of the Cairo conference as the  representative of the National Action Committee  on the Status of Women (NAC). Mulay is a  member of the New Reproductive Technologies  Committee of NAC and has been involved with  the South Asian Women's Centre in Montreal for  many years.  Agnes Huang: The upcoming conference  in Cairo will be the third such conference, the  first being in Bucharest in 1974, the second in  Mexico City in 1984. What is the purpose of  this year's conference?  Shree Mulay: Actually, the Cairo conference is the first conference on population and  development. The earlier ones were on population alone. This points to thechanging trend  or better appreciation by the world community that you cannot talk about population  and not talk about development.  Huang: What do you expect to come out  of the ICPD?  Mulay: At one level, I'm optimistic there  will be better recognition of women's reproductive rights and reproductive healthâa  broader definition of reproductive health  that's not merely related to contraception but  to motherhood, better family health care, and  other issues.  I'm also pessimistic because reproductive rights and reproductive health do not  seem to be seen with respect to ending all  forms of discrimination against women. You  begin to wonder to what extent women are  going to be able to exercise their reproductive  rights when in fact they are [unable to exercise their basic human rights.] So I'm ambivalent about the outcome of this particular conference.  Huang: One of the things that came out of  the PrepCom in New York was a 16-chapter  document setting out a framework for debate  and discussion at the Cairo ICPD. What is  your impression of that document?  Mulay: [I'm critical of it because] there  was one chapter on reproductive rights and  one on reproductive health, but when you  critically examine the other chapters, you  realize that these concerns have been isolated  in these two chapters and that the document  as a whole does not enshrine those ideas.  These two chapters are also full of brackets, [which is] where the rights of women are  put. [The bracketed parts] are also where  there is no consensus and over which most of  the battle [at the Cairo conference] is going to  take place. At the New York PrepCom, it was  clear from the debate on the floor that there is  going to be tremendous resistance to many of  the notions of reproductive rights and reproductive health. The Vatican, of course, continues to lobby strongly for its position that  the right to abortion be opposed.  Huang: What do you think will be some  of the main issues at Cairo?  Mulay: One is the issue of what precisely  constitutes reproductive rights and reproductive health. There are two lines on this  particular issueâthat reproductive rights  means individuals have an unalienable right  to have children no matter what and no one  can decide for them how many children  they should have.  At the other end is the notion that  reproductive rights means the right of people to decide how many children they should  have within a particular social context. This  argument is played out by both the more  conservative governments as well as the  more liberal ones. Canada sort of falls in-  between.  The debate will definitely focus on abortion; on what exactly is fertility regulation  and to what extent contraceptives can be  promoted among young people; and what  exactly constitutes a family. The latter is an  important debate because the Vatican does  not recognize any kind of family except the  nuclear, heterosexual familyâit does not  even recognize the kinds of families that  have existed in many parts of the world,  such as the extended family or families  are you picking on us when you are doing  almost nothing about reducing your consumption? If consumption was reduced by a  miniscule percentage, we would not have  the kind of problem you are talking about."  Women's rights as human rights was an  issue because the abuses that take place  around the enforcement of population control target women. It can be [in the form of]  political force or economic pressuresâfor  example, if you accept this long-acting contraceptive, you will be given a house, piece  of land, or whatever.  Huang: You also attended the People's  Perspectives on Population conference in  Comilla, Bangladesh last December. This  symposium brought together 61 women  from 23 countries. Out of the symposium  came a declaration on population issues.  Part of the declaration was a statement that  "there cannot be a feminist population  policy"...  "I am inclined to agree  with the women from the South...  a population policy is really  an anti-feminist position."  where women as a group collectively take  care of children. The debate on the family  will reflect on who should have access to  information about contraception or childbirth, for example.  The other area of debate is going to be  on the question of sustainable development.  While the conference is supposed to be  about population and development, one  really does not see that much about development. The NGO groups in the South have  felt that the PrepCom document has been  watered down quite a bit with respect to  sustainable development. Governments of  southern countries want no regulations  about what kind of factories they build and  what kind of development takes place while  northern countries are really not dealing  with the issue of how they can limit their  consumption.It'salreadya cliche thatnorth-  ern countries consume 80 percent of world  resources while having 20 percent of the  world's population, and southern countries have 80 percent of the population but  consume only 20 percent of the  resources...yet there is no mention of this in  the document.  Huang: You mentioned that many countries in the South are pushing for an agenda  of unrestricted development. What is the  agenda of women in the south in framing  the discussion around sustainable development?  Mulay: The women from the southern  NGOs at the New York PrepCom were  saying that sustainable development has to  be environmentally viable and not at the  expense of people, that the population policy  programs which seek to limit the number of  children should not be coercive and their  explicit purpose should not be to create this  cheap labour marketâbecause the fewer  children women have, the easier it is for  them to be moved around and work under  hard conditions. [Thewomenalso] focussed  on regulatory issues, such as when you  construct a factory, what kind of environmental regulations should there be to control pollution, since most poor people live  in highly industrialized areas.  One cannot approach the question of  population growth as the only factor in  balancing world resources and development. I heard southern women say, "why  Mulay: About 75 percent of  the Bangladesh conference were from the  South and there was a strong sense that you  cannot talk about a feminist population  policy. There is a debate out there in the  women's movement as to whether there can  be a feminist population policy. For example, the International Women's Health Collective, which is based in New York, holds  the position that it is possible to talk about a  feminist population policy if one places the  question of reproductive health in the context of family health care. According to them,  the two have to be in place in order for it to  be considered any feminist population policy  because it violates and contradicts the basic  premise of feminism.  But having seen what happens with the  kinds of changes and the actual implementation of these programs in Third World countries, I am inclined to agree with the women  from the South; that support of a population  policy is really an anti-feminist position. If  you talk about population as the problem,  than of course the solution would be that  you have to take any measures necessary [to  control population] such as, for example, in  China, where they have a coercive policy  about how many children a woman or a  couple can have. Since it is necessarily coercive, it is really not a feminist solution. One  cannot talk about population policy from  any other perspective except the real situation on the ground, which is that coersion is  used in these population policies, and therefore women should oppose them.  Huang: How do women's groups and  NGOs in the North place themselves in the  debate about whether there can be population policies that do not target women, particularly poor women?  Mulay: My sense is that the spectrum of  NGOs representing women's groups will be  quite wide at the Cairo ICPD. Many of the  northern women's groups think population  is a problem. But, as in Canada, there are  several women's health organizations that  take a position closer to that of the South  because they see the links between what is  happening in the North and in the South. For  example, the situation for Aboriginal  women, women of colour and rural women  is like that for women in the South. [We have  in Canada] the presence of the South right  here in the middle of the North. The kind of  policies we are talking about in the South are  being implemented in Canada with respect  to Aboriginal women.  Another group of women with strong  views are women with disabilities because  they see the implementation of some of these  population policies as having a eugenic dimension to them. They point to the kind of  things that are happening in China, where  the Chinese government has enacted a law  which forces women who have been diagnosed with carrying a child with disabilities  to have an abortion.  Huang: What is NAC's position on issues around population and development?  Mulay: There hasn't really been an overall enunciation of NAC's position with respect to population and development, but  there have been [a number of] resolutions.  For example, a resolution taken in June on  Norplant [a long-acting contraceptive] recognizes that Norplant is being used to limit  the fertility of women in the South, as well as  looks at why it was brought to Canada. That  isanexampleofaclearrecognition[inNAC]  that population control policies limit the  rights of women and are anti-people in many  ways.  NAC generally takes the position of the  right of women to be able to exercise choice  over their bodies. Therefore, on one hand,  NAC supports [the right of] women all over  the world to have access to, say, legal abortion, but, at the same time, recognizes that  many reproductive technologies are being  used against women, such as sex selection to  abort female fetuses and so on. NAC would  like restrictions and control over these kinds  of technologies.  Huang: In terms of what follows the  Cairo conference, is it likely that women  who attend the Cairo conference and who  participate in the 4th UN Conference on  Women in Beijing next year will keep the  discussion of population and development  high on the agenda there?  Mulay: I hope they will. I'm not sure  what will come out of Cairo, certainly with  respect to reproductive rights, health and so  on. But if the onslaught which has been  launched by the Vatican is successful, and  none of these issues get through, I think we  will have to keep this issue quite central to  the Beijing agenda. And not just Beijing, the  Copenhagen Summit [on the Family in July  1995] is also important. It is crucial that there  be recognition of the diversity of families  which exist, including the rights of gays and  lesbians, in order for complete recognition  of the diversity of peoples and families in the  world. The Cairo conference, the Copenhagen Summit and the Beijing conference are a  culmination towards the recognition of some  of these rights.  On the one hand, as I said in the beginning, I'm pessimistic but, on the other, I see  some perceptable changes being made and,  hopefully, these international conferences  contribute to that. I see these international  conferences creating a positive climate to the  extent that women's groups are able to lobby,  to keep women's rights, including reproductive rights, central. [The conferences] also  have provided women with the tools to  work and lobby. Women at the New York  PrepCom were very effective in the way  they carried on the lobby process. There is a  greater need to be able to do that in Cairo, to  ensure some of the wording is not diluted  further but is kept strong.

SEPTEMBER 1994 Feature  NAFTA and Mexico elections:  Women of the Americas  by Maria Julie Amestory   The following was written shortly before  the elections in Mexico on August 21.  Organizations in Mexico that have been  carrying on the struggle against NAFTA and  for a better trade agreement called an interna tiona 1 conference in July and invited guests  from Mexico, United States, Canada and  other Latin American countries. The theme  of the conference was "Integration, Democracy and Development Toward a Social  Agenda for the Continent."  The conference was a forum to continue  developing responses to the crisis in the lives  of the ordinary people in the Americas, created by the continental integration process  and by the global agenda of world capital.  Delegates a t the conference sought wa ys  to combat the decline in living standards,  common throughout the Americas, and the  enormous transfer of wealth from the poorest people to the richest; to counter the growing attacks on democracy and democratic  institutions; to find ways to halt the attack on  health, education and social welfare in  Canada, the US and Latin America; and  finally, to put forward proposals for sustainable development.  The delegates at the conference agreed  on eight major areas that would constitute a  social agenda, and said that before trade  agreements are made, there has to be agreements on:  â¢A declaration of human rights that  every country would have to subscribe to,  and enforce, especially for entry into any  free trade agreement;  â¢An agreement that there be a basic  living standard that apply to all of the people  of the Americas, including standard  healthcare, education and social welfare;  â¢A guarantee of women's rights  throughout the Americas. The double and  triple exploitation of women, particularly in  Latin America, must end;  â¢Rights of Aboriginal people have to be  respected in international and national  agreements and treaties;  â¢Respect for the right of workers to  organize. Basic trade union rights are essential;  â¢The application of democracy at all  levels of government and in all the institutions of government;  â¢A program of sustainable economic  development for the countries of Latin  America, which remove them from being  producers of raw materials for the North  and pools of cheap labour;  â¢ An agreement for the protection of the  environment.  The problem with the trade agreements  such as the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and  the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) is that basic rights have not been  respected. In fact, the FTA and NAFTA are  not trade agreements, but agreements that  make it easy for capital to access sources of  raw material and cheap labour.  At the conference, delegates were not  opposed to free trade, but to the free trade  agenda set by international capital, which is  simply a licence to exploit the people of the  Americas. One Mexican delegate at the conference said women and campasinos (peasants) should be protected. There is a growing national movement bringing together  the urban poor and campasinos to demand,  basic rightsâthe right to food, clean water  and free speech. Women in Latin America  have suffered more exploitation that anyone, and Aboriginal women the most of all-  -exploitation by capital, the state and the  church.  Delegates from Latin America aree  aware NAFTA is only a platform by which  American capital intends to bring into being  continental integration of Latin American  countries on their terms. The delegates from  Chile, Brazil and Columbia made it clear  that their anti-free trade movements will not  allow their countries to enter NAFTA as it  presently stands.  There was agreement that some forms  of continental integration of the economies  of the Americas could be positive and progressive. These could include assistance for  sustainable development in Latin America,  including economic support from the US  and Canada, and an international agreement of individual sovereign states to develop a social charter and a process of liberalizing trade that is an economic agenda for  people.  The barrier to a continental social charter is international capital, which seeks a  charter to carry on unobstructed investment  where it wants, on its own terms. The state  structures of most American countriesâthe  lack of democracy, the influence of the military, and the increasing degree of centralization of controlâalso needs to be overcome.  People are not going to find democracy  in Latin America, and unless the people of  Canada and the US block it, there is going to  be further erosion of democracy here too.  We know that social institutions in the US  and Canada are under attack, and democratic control over them, which should be  strengthened, is being eroded.  The Mexican economy  If you listen to the propaganda of the  Clinton, Mulroney and now Chretien administrations, they would have you believe  that NAFTA and die decisions around it are  beginning to transform the Mexican  economy. In fact the Mexican economy is in  crisis. For example, the Mexican government claims it created two million jobs between 1983 and 1993, but what they don't tell  you is 1.1 million new workers enter the  workforce each yearâthat means there are  nine million more unemployed people than  there were in 1983.  In 1983, 37 percent of the national income went to wages. By 1993 only 25 percent  of the national income went to wages. There  ha s been a decline in the standard of living of  the majority of Mexicans. Child malnutrition went from 7.5 percent to 15 percent. In  1993, the buying power of the Mexican minimum wage dropped to 60 percent of its 1983  value. Minimum wage is now 81 cents per  hour or $6.50 a day. Manufacturing wages in  Canada are eight times that of wages in  Mexico. Per capita income is one-sixth that  of the US.  In the early 80s, there was a [foreign]  debt strike by several major debtor nations,  including Mexico. Mexico was the first to  break down and accept the demands of the  international financial institutions and of the  US. In the early 80s, Mexico owed $80 billion  US in foreign debt. Over the last 14 years,  they ha ve paid off $100 billion in interest and  principal, but now owe $116 billion, in addition, they owe payments on another $125  billion in personal debt and foreign investment. That means Mexico owes $240 billion  US plus interest.  Meanwhile, the number of billionaires  in Mexico has gone from one to over 20.  Mexico has gone through a process of privatization. Last week, Fortune Magazine listed  as the most profitable service corporatrion  in the world Telephonos de Mexico, which  made $2.9 billion US profit last year. The  Mexican government, responding to pres  sure from the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) and the US, privatized the telephone  company. And in keeping with the NAFTA  process, the government recently announced  there will be 20 new maquiladora "free trade  zones" in the state of Chiapas.  Uprising in Chiapas  The significance of the uprising in  Chiapas in Mexico [see Kinesis, Feb/94] has  been understated in the mainstream media.  Since the coming to power of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)  in the 1930s, there is no single event that has  shaken Mexican society more than the revolution in Chiapas. It is not a revolution restricted to the Zapatistas in Chiapas or the  other Southern states of Mexico but has support throughout Mexico.  Last month, the Zapatista National Liberation Army and the Zapatista Front held a  national democratic conference in Chiapas,  with more than 5,000 Mexican and foreign  delegates attending.  The Zapatista revolution is about ending the control of transnational corporations  and rich Mexicans, about land reform and  opposition to NAFTA-which allows priva-  tizationof communal lands to fransnationals  formonoculture.ThepeopleofChiapashave  no choice. They could die of poverty or fight.  In Aguascalientes, Mexico, the Zapatista  National Liberation Army's chief spokesman, known only as Marcos, told some 5000  delegates to the convention that the  Zapatistas would place their weapons at the  disposal of the civilian movement created by  the recent convention in Chiapas. There is  expected to be "peaceful civilian mobilization" if the PRI wins the Mexican elections.  The convention is demanding the creation of  a transitional government that would dismantle the PRI's hold on power in Mexico.  Elections 1994 in Mexico  Mexico's mainstream press supports the  PRI and opposes the leftwing Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PDR) headed by  Cuauhtemoc Cardenasâthe son of the Mexican president in the 30s who nationalized  the oil industry. Cardenas was truly elected  in 1988, but the election was stolen by fraud.  Half-way through the counting of the votes,  the PDR was in the lead, the computers  "brokedown," and when counting resumed,  instead of having 45 percent of the vote as in  the first count, he got 20 percent of the vote  in the second half of the counting.  In Mexico's election this year, the PRI  government says the new voters list only has  a four-percent error, while the PDR says it is  17-percent fraudulent-some people on the  list are dead, never existed, or have been  registered twice, et cetera. The PDR says one  name in six is fraudulent. In addition, millions are not even on the list, yet the list was  closed by the commission several weeks  before the elections.  There is no doubt that massive electoral  fraud will take place in Mexico's elections.  And while the media is aware that the eyes  of the world are looking, it is a controlled  media that does not give the PDR, Zapatistas,  and the opposi rion the kind of coverage they  deserve. International observers may not be  able to prevent massive fraud but their very  presence tells the world that the Mexican  government is so corrupt, it needs watching.  Looking ahead  The only solution is the election of a  democratic government of national unity,  which will work for a continental agreement  with the other nations of Latin and North  America based on sustainable development.  The popular movement in Mexico is  very sophisticated, well developed and  growing. The Mexican people, in growing  numbers, are not prepared to accept the  corporate agenda. Whatever the consequences, we shall see a continuing struggle  by a broad coalition, including churches,  women's organizations, NGOs, campasinos,  the authentic trade union movement, and  others united in this common agenda. There  is a rising anti-free trade movement in Chile  and other Latin American countries and talk  of a secretariat to coordinate the work of  anti-free trade movements of all the countries of the Americas.  In Canada, if you look at the phrases  "competitive advantage," "globally competitive," "restructuring" and "downsizing,"  you find these are euphemisms for reducing  the living standards of Canadians. The objective of the transnational corporations is to  cut the living standards of all of us, and the  argument is: "how can you compete with  manufacturing wages in Mexico that are an  eighth the level of Canadian ones...we all  have to tighten our belts and do with less".  Mexican people support the Canadian  struggle to defend our living standards because they see the ability of the people of  Latin America to say, "we want an improvement in the living standards of Latin America,  we don't want the gap to be one to eight, we  want the wages of Mexican workers to rise  significantly to a continental level." People  in Latin America support our struggles to  maintain our health care, education, social  welfare and minimum wage structure. But  instead, North American corporations tell  us we need to be able to compete with the  third world. Governments are listening to  the corporations and are obsessed with debt  reduction policies, moving closer towards  cutting out social spending, which will lower  corporate tax levels and allow them to make  greater profits.  In the Americas, there is a greatneed for  peoples to work together for sustainable  economic development and mutual assistance. The agenda of the corporations is that  both the North and the South are areas for  exploitation. Our agenda is to build a relationship of solidarity with all peoples of the  Americas, for the developemnt of a new  social agenda for the Americas.  I hope the Mexican people are given the  chance to decide through the vote on a future  that is more justly based on cultural rights,  and that roots out the ignorance on which is  based the most terrible insults to a life of  dignity and respect. There is a big challenge  for anyone who has a social conscienceâthe  possibility to define, through popular victories, the acceptance of human rights as a way  of life in societies of the Americas.

Ash  The Greening Our Cities Conference on  sustainable urban communities in the Vancouver region was held May 7-8 [see Kinesis  Jul/Aug 94]. The conference focussed on  alternative visions to that of a Vancouver  driven by corporate development, as well as  to propose strategies to deal with some of the  pressing ecological issues facing the Greater  Vancouver region, where it is predicted the  population will almost double in the next 30  years. Some of the presentations made by  women at the conference are excerpted and  summarized here.  The first session examined some of the  Vancouver area's history, current problems,  and some positive actions.  Rose Pointe, Education Coordinator of  the Musqueam First Nation, spoke on the  panel, called "Visions of Living with the  Land in the City." The Musqueam's traditional territory includes the areasnow known  as southern Vancouver and Richmond. There  is a reserve near the University of BC, but a  land claim to a much larger area has yet to be  settled.  "... At one time, Vancouver had 27 creeks  that had natural salmon habitat...and now  the only one that has natural salmon in it is  in Musqueam, called the Musqueam creek.  In 1957, they used to call it Tin Can Creek,  because the stores in the area would dump  their garbage in the creek.  "We are trying to keep that creek  alive...But people in the area when they  clean out their swimming pools, it dumps  into the ditches...and some of it ends up in  Musqueam Creek.  "I know that many of the creeks that  once harbored salmon are gone forever, because they were either covered up, bulldozed away, or culverted.  "...Native people talkabout genocide...I  would support that [this is so] in that [the  dominant societies] try to keep us from surviving economically. At one time at Seabird  Island [where I was born,] there were seven  dairy farms. They were disbanded because  our people could not borrow from the bank  to improve the standards [of the dairy farm].  So what were our people to live on...?  ...Logging was the only thing that was  left, and that paid very well in those days...  "The image in those days was "he's just  a farmer." But the farms are where we get  our food from. And I think we have to  support our farmers and keep them. I remember when all along Marine Drive, south  of Marine Drive, there were farms all along  there. Now you only find one."  Mae Burrows of the United Fisherman  and Allied Workers Union spoke of the  impact of urban life on B.C.'s waterways.  "Urban development is...one of the biggest gobblers-up of fish habitat. What we  need to start doing is seeing fish habitat as a  really important part of our ecosystem. Much  of what goes into the marshes can be reclaimed, and reused."  "...We like to think we have sewage  treatment. We have a primary treatment  plant at Iona. 'Primary' is a real misnomer  because all they really do...is scrape the thick  stuff off the top. They test the water at the  end of Iona and there's 120 toxic chemicals  coming out of there into prime salmon  marshland...We use the Fraser River, which  is probably the most important salmon-bearing river in the world...as a gigantic toilet.  "[Politicians] try to generate a tax revolt: Would you pay a gazillion dollars for  sewage or not?' People have said, "yes, we  would pay more for sewage.' That's because  of the work of the citizens groups and grassroots organizations.  Burrows also spoke on the Kemano II  project [see What's News, page 7].  "It's Alcan Aluminum's right, given to  them by two levels of government (federal  and provincial) to virtually have control  over the entire Nechako River, to divert 87  percent of the water in that river...it's not  about aluminum smelting anymore, it's  about hydro consumption. All of these issues, while they often take place throughout the province, every single one of them  ha s to do with us urbanites, who li ve.. down  here.  "The province is going ahead with the  Kemano Completion project to provide us  with hydroelectricity based on the assumption that we're going to keep growing, that  we can't limit growth...We have enough  energy in this province now; if we moved  into conservation, [we could] save 50 percent of the energy we're consuming. We  don't need Kemano II."  Rachel Rosen of the Environmental  Youth Alliance spoke on her work with the  Youth Stewardship Project:  "We are creating a youth garden at  Cottonwood Community garden in the  Downtown Eastside. This area...is the lowest per-capita income community in  Canada...there's a real lack of park space,  wildspace, compared to the west side of  Vancouver. It's been traditionally neglected.  "There's five acres of community garden there. Strathcona Garden was started  about ten years ago on a dump site. Then  Cottonwood branched out of that three years  ago...I think it's an amazing example of  what people can do with this abandoned  land. We are going in there and dealing  with car parts, other kinds of garbage, sand  from baseball diamonds that the city  dumped on the ground. This is what we're  trying to garden in.  "We're not only growing food but  there's a lot of ecological implications to our  work, such as soil reclamation, and wildlife  habitat. There's a social aspectâa real sharing of knowledge as people of different  ages and backgrounds have so much to  offer.. It's a great way to educate people on  a basic hands-on level. Too often, kids think  that fish grows in styrofoam, and adults  bite into tomatoes and don't realize that  they were picked by indentured labourers  in Mexico who are working for multinational corporations.  "..In planning for a green city, we have  to take into account cultural [and] educational backgrounds, class...we need to start  breaking down some of the oppressions  that exist between all of us...we need to  support people who are working within  those issues."  Concern about access and linking with  diverse communities was stressed a number  of times during the conference (which was  attended by relatively few people of colour.)  The question, "what are our visions of  a green city that is socially just?" was an  important part of the conference. In introducing the session on "Visions of Community Well-being" Marcia Nozick (editor of  City magazine) spoke on the connections  between sustainability and justice:  "It's important to understand that the  same forces that are polluting our air, our  water, our soil, those same economic forces  are undermining and dismanding the structure of community life...Rootlessness and  dispossession are the inevitable byproducts  of an economy that's based on global competition and capital mobility. People have  to move to find jobs; corporations move to  find cheaper labour. I've been told thateven  the average food molecule in Canada travels  2,000 miles before it reaches our dinner table.  "Vancouver sees itself as being a 'world  class city'âthis world-class city vision is  based on ever-expanding growth and consumption, on unfair trade practices, and on  gross inequities in access to land and resources and to the decision-making process.  I think the challenge for the Green City  vision is to create a city that has communities  that are more economically self-sufficient,  where people have their needs met and that  are grounded in the experiences of people  who live in these communities."  Heather Pritchard of the Community  Alternatives Society (CAS) spoke of belonging to an intentional community for  over 15 years. Most members live in a housing co-op in Kitsilano, and the Society also  runs Fraser Farm Co-op in Aldergrove, an  organic farm.  "I am definitely below the poverty line,"  said Pritchard, "but I don't have an experience of poverty, because my housing charges  are based on my income." Affordability is  key: "Right now in Kitsilano [an area of  Vancouver that became genrrified in the  1980's and saw land and housing prices  skyrocket] we'd never be able to do what we  did 15 years ago."  CAS has an "edible landscape:" fruit  trees in the front and back yards, wild garden along the perimeter. The farm co-op  provides some income through sale of seasonal salad and garnish products to restaurants. They share equipment and appliances  and, like in many co-ops, have a free bin to  re-use goods.  The community regularly pledges  money which is then directed toward various social change projects.  For example, composting has been taking place for the last decade, using a huge  "one of a kind" composter which has "engineers from all over the world phoning up to  find out how it works." They now have  some funding to construct prototypes of this  composter, to do composting for apartment  buildings. Another project is "Farm Folk/  City Folk", which focusses on issues of food  and agriculture.  The second day of the conference  focussed on action.  Nancy Skinner, an activist in urban  ecology issues in Berkeley, California for 20  years, talked about her experience in urban  activism. Among the groups she has been  active with is Berkeley Citizens Action  (BCA):  "The most important aspect of BCA is  that it evolved out of progressive social  change movements. It was a coalition made  up of student groups, anti-war groups, senior citizen groups, tenantactivists,civil rights,  the women's movement. The bottom line is  that social justice and social equity were  always the focus of the organization. BCA's  environmental activism grew out of these  concerns. Thus it was primarily centred on  the environmental issueswhich provided an  opportunity for community development  [and] social equity.  "I think [this is] important because, to  be honest, the environmental movement has  still pretty much been a white middle class  movement. If we come a tit from the.tradirion  of the environmental movement, which has  mostly been a conservation movement, we  lose a lot of people. If we come at it from the  community development [and empowerment] point of view, then it's much more  embracing."  One of the first environmental issues  BCA tackled was energy conservation when  US fuel prices rose in the late 70s. Low  income people were harder hit as more of  their income goes toward essential needs.  When the city's budget was reduced by tax  cuts, social programs began to be cut; the  BCA "proposed energy conservation as a  way that the city could save money,  internally,...so we could redirect that money  to social programs.  "The essential component of achieving  a green city is community buy-in, which  requires coalition-building and participatory democracy integrated into every aspect  of your work...It's not enough to have a  vision, and then try to sell it or impose it,  because people have to own it, people have  to feel it's their vision too." Coalition-building requires "recognizing and respecting"  existing organizations in the communities  with which you want to make links.  Marcia Nozick spoke on her work as  the Healthy Communities Coordinator in  Winnipeg:  "Winnipeg is very different from Vancouver. Winnipeg is being marginalized in  the global economy and our inner city is  rapidly declining.  "We're looking at how we can develop  a local economy that can support the inner  city...We're looking at projects that  strengthen the local economy and avoid creating dependency on charity systems and on  other systems which are not designed to  build human self-reliance and self-respect  among participants. We don't support food  banks, we support other kinds of alternatives, [like] community kitchens. We promote the sharing of wealth, power, and decision-making, and cooperative approaches  to community economic development."  Nozick says they are "auditing" organizations, businesses and government institutions for their contribution to community  development. The criteria include: "production of goods and services [locally] for local  use"; "long-term employment of local residents; local skill-development; local decision-making."  Some of the actions coming out of the conference include an Eco-City Network [see Bulletin Board]; a group supporting First Nations  land claims, called Friends of the Treaty Process  [con tact: Marion Halle 876-62 73]; and a Food in  the City group [contact: Susan Petersen 228-  9802].

SEPTEMBER 1994 Interview with Pascasia Kabazaire:  "We want to be called Rwandese."  as told to L Muthoni Wanyeki i__  L. Muthoni Wanyeki: The conflict in Rwanda has resulted  in over 500,000 deaths and an outpouring of refugees, 65  percent of whom are women and children, into neighboring  African countries. Living in Canada, it has been difficult fo\  get an accurate picture of what is going on. Although the  conflict entered the mainstream media here in April, with  the death of Pvandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, it  has been going on for over three years. <~ould you give us a  little history?  Pascasia Kabazaire: In Rwanda, there are three tribes:  Bahutu, a big group; Barutsi, the ones fighting to form a new  government; and batwa, the pygmy people, very small in  number.  These people lived together under a King before 1959.  After that time, the Hutu formed a government. But they  were too strict. Even though they were supposed to share  and give some seatsin government to the Tutsi people, they  refused everything to the Tutsi people. From 1959 on, Tutsi  people ran away from Rwanda.  Pascasia Kabazaire and L. Muthoni Wanyeki  Three years ago, they were fed up with being refugees.  They asked to come home, but the government refused. So  they came by forceâactually if they hadn't been prevented  by the French, they would have managed to go in without  too much bloodshed.  When Habyarimana met with the UN [United Nations]  in Arusha and theOAU[Organizationof African Unity] was  â¢ arranging for everything to be done well. Some extremist  Hutu didn't like it. They arranged the mass killings behind  the back of the UN. The RPF [Rwandese Patriotic Front] went  in quickly to see if they could save some people.  Wanyeki: The agreement that was reached in Arusha  was that Habyarimana was to take leadership for the interim  and to lead the country into multiparty elections where there  was meant to be some power sharing.  'â     Kabazaire: Yes, but extremist Hutu didn't like it, they  wanted to rule forever by themselves.  Wanyeki: The western, mainstream media continue to  explain the situation in Rwanda as being solely based on  tribalismâas they tend to do with almost all political crises  in Africa.  For example, right  now, the labour and student riots in Nigeria  around the military governments refusal to accept the multiparty election results and the conflict that those riots have  sparked arealsobeingex-  plained in solely  tribalisticterms.Whatare  your thoughts on that?  Kabazaire:  Habyarimana and Hutu  extremists were trying to  use tribalism to keep political power to themselves. But now, the RPF  and the Hutu that are in  government are trying to  avoid tribalism. The war,  fighting and bloodshed  will never end if this tribalism goes on. We want  to be called Rwandeseâ  not Hutu, not Tutsi, not  Twa.  Wanyeki: So tribalism is actually a tool that's  used to divide people...  Kabazaire: Yes, it's a way of dividing people to keep  power. There is a saying: "divide and rule."  .Wanyeki: And there are Hutu members of the RPF, isn't  that right?  Kabazaire: Yes, the RPF is said to be Tutsi but actually  they are mixed. They are like me, they don't believe they are  Hutu or Tutsi. Moreover, there are Hutu who have always  been against Habyarimana's government, some of whom  are also now joining the RPF. There are different political  parties, but they want to be called Rwandese, they want to  share power. And they also want all of the refugees to return.  Those who ran away long ago, those who are in Ngoma [in  Zaire] now, should go home.  Wanyeki: Now that the conflict has settled somewhat,  what do you think the priorities are in terms of rebuilding?  What are progressives saying both in Rwanda and abroad?  Kabazaire: We wish the refugees that are suffering the  most in Ngoma would go bac"k home. There are too many,  there are no facilities there. The solution is to go home and to  build a new government and the country. There is totally  zero now, everything is gone.  Wanyeki: One of the questions we hear a lot is what to do  with the extremists that sparked this kind of bloodshed.  What are people saying about justice, about making sure that  tribalistic propaganda and this kind of induced conflict  doesn't happen again?  Kabazaire: We all have to fight it. We should help one  another and share. There is no need to keep power, that is  dangerous. As it is, if the Hutu hadn't refuse power to the  Tutsi before, this wouldn't have happened.  Wanyeki: The conflict has resulted in the outpouring of  refugees, most of whom are women and children, into  neighbouring African countries. We've heard a lot about the  death of the President, but we haven't heard much about the  death of the Prime Minister who was a woman. Women and  children always seem to bear the brunt of this kind of war.  Do you want to talk about that?  Kabazaire: It is a pity that women in Rwanda were not  given opportunities in government. If many women had  been in government, they would have had the heart to  sympathize with everybody. They are not money-minded;  they don't want power for power's sake. The former Prime  Minister, Agathe Unwillingiyimana, was against discrimination. She wanted power to be shared amongst the Hutu,  Twa and Tutsi. She was happy that the Tutsi were coming  back into the country. She was the first to be beheaded.  And many woman were raped before being killed.  There are now many orphans. So, woman and children are  suffering the most in Rwanda.  Wanyeki: What has the response been from Rwandans  living abroad in terms of organizing and support work?  Kabazaire: The world is helping Rwanda, helping the  refugees in Ngoma.  Wanyeki: You mentioned that there were four Rwandese  families living in Vancouver. What have Rwandans here  been doing during this period?  Kabazaire: We feel very concerned, we wonder what to  do. Communications are a problem, we can't even write to  people there. Right now, we are just waiting. After that, we  will itry to make contact and help by all means.  'Wanyeki: And the last question. As a Rwandese woman  living abroad yourself, what do you feel women, and especially women of colour, living in Canada should know?  Kabazaire: Women should be helped, especially those  who come from another country for a better life. We should  be given the opportunity to do the jobs we know we can do  and not be denied that opportunity because we are foreigners. We should be helped, be trained in the fields we want so  that we don't sit without doing anything.  Wanyeki: Is there anything else you would like to add?  Kabazaire: Yes. Many Rwandese women have never had  the opportunity to get an education. But they are talented  musicians, good singers and dancers. If I had money, I  would help them to travel and sing and dance so they could  raisejnoney to help the orphans at home-we have a lot of  orphans in Rwanda, morethananywhere else. These women  could help if they where given the opportunity to do so.  Pascasia Kabazaire is a Rwandan housewife and single mother  currently living in Vancouver. L. Muthoni Wanyeki is a mixed  race, Kenyan lesbian who has worked in community-based  media in Vancouver. Thanks to Amal Hassan for transcribing  this interview, and to Dawit of Immigrant Services for  assistance in arranging this interview. A longer version of this  interview aired in August on Obaa, a show for and by women  of colour on Co-op Radio, Vancouver.  An abbreviated history  compiled by L Muthoni Wanyeki  Pre-colonial times:  1300s: Tutsi migration from the north  into what is now Rwanda following an earlier Hutu migration. The Tutsi are  cattlekeepers. The Hutu are farmers. Exchange of goods occurs. Intermarriage between Tutsi, Hutu and Twa (the pygmy  indigenous people), becomes common. The  kingdom of Gasabo comes into being, with a  common language, common traditions and  common religion. All clans in Gasabo come  to have members from all three nations  [tribes]. The kingdom is feudal, but based on  consensus decision-makingbetween the king  and village chiefs, chiefs and sub-chiefs, and  the elders.  Colonial times:  1899-1916: Gasabo is seen as a German  protectorate after the arbitrary division of  Africa amongst European colonizing states.  1919: Gasabo is ceded to the Belgians as  Ruanda-Urundiâfirst under a League of  Nations mandate, then as a UN trust territory. European missionaries/ethnologists  enter and the people begin to be registered  along national [tribal] lines.  1926: The Belgians pass the Morteham  Law, directing King Musinga to appoint  only Tutsi as chiefs. He refuses to do so.  1931: The King is forcibly exiled to Zaire  by the colonial governor. His brother  Gitarama takes over. The Hutu are forced  into labour by the Tutsi Chiefs who have  been placed in the position of acting as an  enforcers for the Belgians.  1959: Peasant uprisings begin over issues of land and exclusion from political  power. Refugees leave for Tanzania, Uganda  and Zaire.  1961:The Gitarama monarchy ends with  a coup d'etat.  Post-colonial times:  1962: Rwanda and Burundi gain their  independence. Elections are held in Rwanda.  Hutu representatives win most of the seats.  Tutsi representatives who won seats are  killed. A military, one-party state is established under President Kayibanda. The Tutsi  are persecuted for land acquired under colonization. The flow of refugees continues as  the mass killings of Tutsi begin.  1973: President Kayibanda is overthrown by former Minister of Defense,  Juvenal Habyarimana. The French provide  training and financial support to the  Rwandese army and support to the new  government.  1980s: President Obote in Uganda orders the expulsion of all Rwandese refugees.  Some Rwandese join with the Ugandan opposition under Museveni.  1986: President Museveni comes to  power in Uganda.  1987: Museveni's Rwandese supporters  form the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and  with his support, begin negotiating with  President Habyarimana for the unconditional  return of all Rwandese refugees to Rwanda.  October 1990: Negotiations fail. Returning Rwandese are harassed and sometimes  killed. TheRPF enters Rwanda. The civil war  begins. Internal opposition to the authoritarian and discriminatory nature of  Habyarimana's regime steps up. Some members of the opposition join with the RPF as it  advances. The army provides military training and arms to the Interahamwe, the youth  wing of Habyarimana's party, the National  Republican Movement for Democracy and  Development (NRMDD). The Interahamwe  begin mass killings of Tutsi civilians, Tutsi  and Hutu opposition members and intellectuals under official orders. The French interfere, siding with Habyarimana's government.  August 1993: Under internal and western pressures for political pluralism, the  military government signs a peace accord  with the RPF in Arusha, Tanzania, intended  to end the three-year civil war. Fausrin  Twagiramungu, a Hutu opposed to  Habyarimana's regime, is designated Prime  Minister for an 18-month interim period. At  the end of this period, Rwanda is meant to  hold its first multiparty elections to form a  six-party coalition government.  Late 1993: The French leave Rwanda  under pressure from the RPF and the African and Western countries who brokered  the Arusha peace accord.  April 6, 1994: President Juvenal  Habyarimana dies in unexplained plane  crash. Suspected are Hutu extremists op  posed to the Arusha peace accord; and the  RPF.  April 7, 1994: Prime Minister Agathe  Uwillingiyimana,amoderateHutu,opposed  todiscriminationalongnational [tribal] lines  and a supporter of political pluralism, is  executed by the Interahamwe. Radio Mille  Collines and Radio Rwanda begin to broadcast anti-Tutsi propaganda. Mass killings  begin. Civilians begin to stream into Ngoma,  Zaire.  April 8,1994: The RPF begins its offensive from the east. The UN removes almost  all its personnel from Rwanda.  May 23,1994: A 36-hour truce allows  for the entry of a UN special envoy whose  purpose is to attempt negotiations between  the military government and the RPF.  May 25, 1994: The UN sends 5,500  peacekeepers into Rwanda. The Congo [Zaire?], Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe commit troops. The  military government agrees to UN-sponsored peace talks. The RPF refuses to negotiate with the military government, which it  terms criminal for the incitement of genocide. It states its intention to enter a ceasefire  only when the massacre of civilians ends  and when civilians are granted safe passage.  June 23,1994: The French enter Rwanda  with 2,500 troops and begins to establish a  security zone in southwest Rwanda. The UN  Security Council has approved Operation  Turquoise as a two-month long humanitar-  ian mission for the protection of civilians,  butigrants the French pre-emptive military  measures. The RPF terms Operation Turquoise a foreign invasion.  July 4,1994: The RPF gains control of the  capital city, Kigali, and with it, has secured  the eastern half of Rwanda. The French initially try to stop the RPF advance westward,  but later return to their protection of civilians  mandate.  July 9, 1994: The RPF charges Canada  with harbouring a Hutu extremist, former  Presidentia 1 Advisor Leon Mugesera, a landed  immigrant doing post-doctoral work at Laval  University, who was identified by Amnesty  International. The RPF demands his trial by  the international human rights tribunal for  inciting genocide in a 1992 speech.  July 14,1994: The Prime Minister-designate Twagiramungu arrives. The RPF declares a unilateral ceasefire. It also demands  the trial for war crimes of members of the  RNMDD and re-education, rather than punishment for civilians who participated in the  mass killings. Twagiramungu states his intention to abide by the Arusha peace accord,  excluding the RNMDD from the coalition.  August 22,1994: The French are due to  withdraw, to be replaced by UN-sponsored  African assistance mission.  Thanks to Pascasia Kabazaire for all the  background information.  Commentary:  by L Muthoni Wanyeki  As is the case with wars the world over,  the civil war in Rwanda has had devastating  consequences. There have been over 500 000  deaths, 65% of them women and children.  In some cases, entire families have been  wiped out. There has been an outpouring of  almost three million refugees into neighbouring African countries. Humanitarian  aid-food supplies, medical supplies, medical personnel~to the refugee camps is pitifully inadequate. Aid workers estimate that  there have been an additional 25 000 deaths  due to cholera and dysentery. There are at  least 75 000 orphaned children. The cash-  crop based economy of Rwanda is ruined:  unpicked coffee rots on the bushes. Schools  and hospitals have been looted. There is no  electricity, no running water, no sewage  systems. The enormity of the tasks ahead is  staggering. And how to begin to deal with  the trauma of witnessing mass rapes, mass  murders, the displacement of entire peoples?  To aid in the recovery, it is imperative  that we understand exactly what happened -  -and it has been hard indeed to reach that  understanding here in Canada because of  the framing of the situation in Rwanda by  the North American media. A Somali woman  from Africa Watch, a London-based human  rights information group, has called the  mainstream western media's coverage of  Rwanda shameful. And it has been shameful indeed.  The mainstream western media's formulaic response to any political crisis in the  third world-and particularly in Africa-has  been followed to a tee. Observation: Internal  conflict. Reason: Tribalism. Consequences:  "THOSE people are killing themselves!"  Moral Dilemma: "Should WE let them do  that to each other?" New observations: An  outpouring of civilians into neighbouring  countries. An estimated 200-500 000 deaths,  65% of those women and children. A higher  moral purpose emerges: "SAVE THEM!"  And in comes the cavalry...  The problem with this kind of formulaic  response is that the emergence of the dilemma and its resolution by the rise of a  higher moral purpose on the part of the West  tends to obscure the historical facts behind  the initial observation of internal conflict.  The obscuring of history, even very recent  history, means that basic Western assumptions can be called into play. The cavalry can  thus ride in, assured of its messianic role,  and the only debate from that point on will  be debate on the logistics of the cavalry's  deployment.  The mainstream western media would  have us believe that the conflict in Rwanda is  solely tribal in nature. That long-standing  tribalism between the Tutsi of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front and the militia of the Hutu  government flared into civil war with the  murder of Rwandese Hutu president on  April 6. This simple call-and-response approach has utterly failed to account for the  recent history of the African continent, as  well as the particular political context of  Rwanda.  The late 1980s and the early 1990s saw a  continent-wide movement for political pluralism in Africa. Sparked in part by the fall  of single-party states in the so-called Eastern  Bloc, the multiparty movement became a  focus for popular anger and frustration over  economic hardships and human rights violations, specifically around political dissent  and organized protest. Articulated by intellectuals, as well as by the now well-established professional and business classes, the  multiparty movement drew the eager support of Western donor countries and agencies. For the professional and business  classes, for the most part, advocated an end  to corruption by the implementation of free  trade policies. Right-wing economic agendas became synonymous with the term democracy.  With western pressure and rising internal dissatisfaction, multiparty elections were  held in many former one-party states. And  while the elections have meant that many  governments that had grown comfortable  with the power for authoritarian control  have been toppled, they have also meant  that attempts at socialism and state control  of various industries for the purpose of equitable distribution have, in several countries,  been put to rest.  In all of these conflicts, threatened regimes have used any and all tools possible to  retain political and economic power. The  situation in Rwanda is no different. And  tribalism has always been a useful tool to  manipulate power. The Belgians were aware  of that when they implemented the  Morteham Law in colonial times, which  granted political power solely to the Tutsi.  The military government was aware of that  when it attempted to redistribute land upon  independence. The state-run media and the  militia of the Interahamwe has been aware  of that as it strongholds for the fading regime  against internal opposition and the entry of  the RPF. Tribalism in Rwanda is not longstanding-it dates back to the Morteham La w.  There are Hutu opposed to Habyarimana's  regime. TherearebothHutu and Tutsi in the  RPF. And the UNHCR [UN High Commission for Refugees] has no evidence that the  RPF is exacting revenge for the mass murder  of Tutsi upon the return home of Hutu refugees.  The role of the French in supporting the  Habyarimana regime cannot be forgotten.  The support of the west for the power-sharing Arusha peace accord is suspect, given  that political pluralism will achieve no real  economic change for the people of Rwanda-  -although certainly, the gain of a safe homeland for all its peoples cannot, by any means,  be seen as trivial.  My point is that African people mobilizedâand will continue to mobilizeâbecause  they have felt disempowered. That  disempowerment and the struggles it produces are not tribal in nature, although they  may come to be articulated along tribal lines.  Struggle is always both economic and political in nature-tribalism is a convenient tool-  -and a colonial invention in the case of  Rwanda-to divert attention from what is  really at stake.  The western free trade agenda means  that the west has a stake in the outcomes of  those struggles. Tne arrival of the cavalry,  named as peacekeepers, obscures that fact  by implying neutrality.  We know the west is not neutral. We  have a responsibility not to play into the set-  ups placed before us.   An earlier version of this commentary aired in  June on Obaa, a show for and by women of  colour on Co-op Radio in Vancouver. Feature  Interview with Himani Bannerji:  Women against religious  fundamentalism  by Himani Bannerji, as told to  Fatima Jaffer   This article first appeared on the centre  pages in the April 1994 issue of Kinesis. Due  to a printing error, the colour overlay on the  text made it difficult, if not impossible, to  read the article. The Kinesis Editorial Board  decided to reprint the article this month  following numerous verbal and written requests to that effect from Kinesis readers [see  Letters, page 19].  Himani Bannerji is from India. She is a  member of an Indian women s group, Sachetana  (consciousness). She teaches in the Sociology  department at York University in Toronto. She  researches in the area of gender and colonialism,  particularly looking at the women's movement  in India. She is part of an ongoing discussion  about women and fundamentalism in India..  Kinesis spoke with Bannerji, who was in Vancouver last month.  Fatima Jaffer: Could you define fundamentalism and communalism?  Himani Bannerji: In Canada, community and communalism are good words. If  you call somebody a communalist in Vancouver or Toronto, you would not usually be  saying they're politically reactionary. But in  India, communalism is tied up with religious bigotry and right-wing definitions of  communityâstickingupforcommunity,de-  fined on the basis of religion, versus all  people, or community versus class. Class  politics are wider and include Hindus, Muslims, and Christiansâall people or national  politics that have a notion of a liberal democratic state for all are short-circuited by communalism. Communalism leads to the creation of countries on the basis of religion.  Communities in India are indigenous  communities, so there's no question of sticking up for your ownâyour own exists all  over. You don'ttalkabout littleethnic groups  because this isn't about an ethnic group in  India; it's about 13 percent of the indigenous  peopleâthe largest Muslim presence anywhere in the world.  jaffer: You're talking in sheer numbers,  because there's the whole Middle East as  well.  Bannerji: Yes, but no Middle Eastern  country, no country in the world has as  many Muslims as India. You're talking about  12-13 percent in present-day India, minus  Bangladesh, minus the area that is Pakistan,  and it's still the largest Muslim concentration in the world. So if your community is  the whole country, community politics in  that sense does not make sense. The dalit (the  untouchables caste) community politics  might be called community politics, but it  will never be called communalism. Communalism came to be an euphemism for  standing for your own religious grouping,  for a state founded on the basis of religion.  This is why the Muslim League and the  Hindu Mahasabha would be considered  communal politics, because they would  name the political subject as being religious  identity, not a social, national, economic  identity.  This is why "communalism" is a bad  thingâit means somebody who wants no  single state, someone who does not believe  in the rights of all workers, someone who  first defines people in terms of religion, then  defines politics and exclusivity on the basis  of that.  Jaffer: How does caste fit in to this?  Bannerji: Caste is one of the definitions  in what we are talking about, but caste politics didn't arise like that. We'll leave that  aside for now. Let's look at f undamenta lism,  which isagainareworkingof religion. When  a group of people decide that they know  what the true fundamental meaning is, they  become the fundamental spokesperson for  interpreting [that meaning.] A practising  Hindu or Muslim can practise religion in  many different ways. Fundamentalism is  not being religious. You can be a practising  Hindu or Muslim, you don't have to be a  fundamentalist. Whatmakes you fundamentalist is believing that one version is the one  true version and there is no other, excluding  all the competing versions and practices that  exist.  Jaffer: And believing no other version  should exist...  Bannerji: Yes, claiming a monopoly of  definition for one truth of the religion. Fundamentalism is extremely elitist. It comes  from the aristocracy of any group, Hindus  or Muslims and, in the context of India, it's  Reagan gave very solid support to Christian  fundamentalism. When [US president  George) Bush bombed Iraq [during the "Gulf  War" of 1992], he prayed the whole night  with [Christian fundamentalist] Billy  Graham. Why Billy Graham? Yet no-one  made a big issue out of this, or noted that he  supported the American state as a fundamentalist state. But if an Islamic leader had  done that, it would immediately be highlighted in the Western media as fundamentalist and fanaticist.  In the West, Christian fundamentalism,  in direct and indirect ways, has a lot of ties  with state policies, such as the way that  welfare is decided, the way that women are  looked at, the way that abortion rights are  talked about, the way gays and lesbians are  labeled. All this has to do with how these  states relate to moral-majority campaigns  and fundamentalism within their own countries.  Jaffer: And all these things threaten the  economic base, the people who have power,  or people for whom the economy is structured...  Bannerji: Economic issues are more indirectly but very powerfully involved. In  Part of the strength  [of fundamentalism] comes from  how it is presented in  international politics and...media  the (Ulemat's) or the Brahminical castist interpretation of Hinduism parading as the  real Hinduism and the real Islam of the  country.  Jaffer: And it is directed at the non-elite,  the "masses."  Bannerji: Yes, it becomes the representative, the spokesperson for millions of people. It suppresses all the other voices that are  within that religious group and actively  works to put them out of existence.  Jaffer: Where does it get its strength?  H: Well, it doesn't manage to [put other  voices out of existence], fortunately. One of  the problems with Western propaganda  about fundamentalism is that [the propaganda] makes [fundamentalism] into something real. In India, hundreds of thousands  of people disagree with these [fundamentalist] versions of Hinduism and Islam. I have  been in marches where a million people  marched against the destruction of the  Ayodhya mosque [in December, 1992, by  the BJP, Bharatya Janata Party, the Indian  People's Party, one of the Hindu fundamentalist political parties] but no one reported  that here. There's no attempt to highlight the  competing and contesting views inside the  country itself. Part of the strength [of fundamentalism] comes from how it is presented  in international politics and in the international media.  Jaffer: What about Christian fundamentalism?  Bannerji: When you look at the American presidency and its support of fundamentalism in regard to abortion issues, the  "family", or homosexuality, you find that  people like [former US president Ronald]  India, people don't talk much about fundamentalism; they talk about Hindu and Muslim right-wing reaction.  Indian nationalism has many strands.  Some of it is not religious-based, some of it  is. The version of India as Hindu wasn't  invented by the nationalists. It was the work  of almost a hundred years of British  historiography and administration. Having  taken over India from the Muslims, British  historiography talks about India as belonging to Hindus, and of Muslims as foreigners.  Eighteenth century Orientalist writers in the  West,forexample,definedtheoriginalpopu-  larion of India to be Hindu. The new formula  of Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan, that the Sangh  Parivar (coalition of Hindu fundamentalists  associations political parties) is using has its  roots in that.  What is forgotten is that only a very  small number of Muslims came to India  from the Middle East. The millions of Muslims living in India are actually indigenous  to India, people who chose a religious conversion, but culturally, socially, regionally,  linguistically, are Indian. The myth of the  Muslim as "foreigner," came from the crusade literature of Europe, and the perenial  trade competition between the merchantry  of the Red Sea area, and the European  merchantry.  Until the 17th century, the Ottoman  Empire was present all the way to Vienna,  half-way into what is called Europe now. A  whole set of stereotypes in Europe were  invented about the Muslims. It wasn't until  the late 18th century when the English took  hold of Bengal that this became the ruling  discourse: Muslims as the outsider, Muslim  as the invader, Muslim as the fanatic.  The mixture of religions, cultures and  politics in India that go way back are completely ignored. For example, the fact that  Urdu as [an Indian] language is a form of  Farsi [a Middle Eastern language,] the fact  that the clothes you and I are wearing right  now are of both the Middle East and India, is  completely forgotten.Thecolonialdiscourse  of seeing India as Hindu was spread out  very far.  Cultural nationalism from the mid-19th  century picked up this cultural formulation  of India as Hindu. Indian nationalism can be  said to have at least three elements: Hinduism; the liberal democracy of the West, i.e.  the separation between state and religion  and a civil state for all; and a quasi-socialist  component from the anarchism, communism and socialism of Europe collapsed into  something called the Fabian socialism of the  Nehruvian Congress. There were different  periods during which different strands predominated. In the late 19th and early 20th  century, there was a big competition between which strand would get hold of the  politics.  [Mahatma] Ghandi straddled the two.  On one hand, Ghandi did have a religious  kind of understanding and his use of  Ramayana (a classical Hindu ethical text)  was predominant, particularly with regards  to the poor. Ghandi had three or four voices  with which he spoke [to different  peoples]...That is why Ghandi's ability to  bind large numbers of people of disparate  positions could clearly come about.  Jaffer: Which, in some sense, is often the  only option available during an anti-  colonialist war...  Bannerji: To some extent, except that  Ghandi never supported communists, public distribution, public control or public  means of production. Whereas Ghandi supported the poor, he also said, in his kingdom  of Rama, the just kingdom, there'll be kings  and beggars. Beggars will be looked after by  kings, and kings will also be respected by the  lower classes. But he never said why in a  country there should be kings or beggars.  If Ghandi had any enemy bigger than  the British it was the Soviet Union and the  communists. The first act of the Indian state  whenitcameinpowerinl947wastobanthe  Communist Party of India. For three years,  they banned the party, lots of people were  killed, and there was enormous persecution  of Communists. The Ghandi who said not to  give revenue to the British never supported  the peasants in their no-rent struggle against  local landlords. He remained solidly with  the property owner.  The same tool he used to unite people  also divided people. He named the people as  Hindus, and named the people as Muslims,  gave them an ideological space in his kingdom, but never considered them as producing people of the country who should have  the means of social wealth in their control.  After almost 50 years of Indian independence, about 45 percent of people live below  starvation level. People still own hundreds  of thousands of hectares of land, and that is  considered okay by the state even though,  legally, it is forbidden. But the landless Indian poor cannot challenge a landlord for  owning hundreds of thousands of hectares,  14  SEPTEMBER 1994 Feature  given that also part of the landlord's family is  in the government, makes legislation, and  industrializes India. There's no way people  could ever implement these laws and the  government has no real will to do it.    â¢  This is why nationalist slogans on religion talking about economic questions take  hold. This deprivation is volatile and politically actionable. You're not talking about  consciousness and culture, you're talking  about complete and utter deprivation, starvation, the selling of women in markets, the  selling of children in markets, the labour of  five year olds, the dispossession of people to  an extent where cities have grown to the size  of up to 16 million people because the countryside is totally and completely devastated  and controlled.  The left organizing in India has been  internally weakened and externally bashed  in by the state powers, a powerful, Draconian  imperial state which has inherited the colonial machinery. [The government] didn'tdis-  mantle it, but reinforced it. The state has one  of the largest standing armies in the worldâ  an army that does not often go and do things  to other nations, but works on its own people.  India has five kinds of well-trained, and well-  funded police.  Again, their main target is the poor, the  "unruly" and the "ungovernable". The British called Indians ungovernable, the rich now  call the Indian poor ungovernable. The government has also dismantled a lot of people's  organizations and continually threatened  popular, class-based, anti-state organizations  of any kind.  Ideologically, the left has never really  addressed the question of culture, not because it didn't want to, but it put them in a  strange quandary; the quandary of Ghandi.  That is, if you name people on the basis of  religion, you stand the risk of exacerbating  religious differences. If you don't, you stand  the risk of actually ignoring realities within  which people actually live.  Then comes electoral politics, which use  features of religion to get votes. [Mahatma]  Ghandi's great gift to the Muslim community  of Muslim personal lawwasanassaultagainst  women as far as I'm concerned. Upping the  religious definitions of people and saying "I  am the protector of the minorities" has been  a big game of the Congress Party. Today, it's  members of the Sangh Parivar which were  not importantduring independence [in 1947]  but have now become powerful [because]  they are reaping the benefits of games that  Congress has played for over 30 years now.  Places where there had been gains by  Congress have now become major riot belts.  In 1991, the Prime Minister of India released something called the Mandal Commission, [which] said that poor people, on  the grounds of poverty and not just caste,  should have affirmative action or what they  called positive discrimination. Naming people as low caste took the scenario away from  the right-wing to some extent and, in the  name of caste politics, created class politicsâ  in many places lower caste and lower class  are synonymous.  The Mandal Commission actually had a  way of creating solidarity among the people,  which was very inimical to the interest of the  right-  People were then called back into the  [right-wing's] folds in the name of being  Hindu, or Muslim, creating big hegemonic  blocks that can be pitted against one another.  Huge riots followed. The media's rule has  also been lethal in the communilisation of  Indian life and politics. The media got captured by Hinduization, by history programs  that they used to run [on TV] and still do. One  [program] was a complete Hinduisation of  Indian history, done by historians who were  Hindu fundamentalists themselves. The Muslim rulers and any benevolence in their eras  [of rule in India] was completely forgotten as  were many facts of Hindu history, or that  language and cultural things, like dances,  were a combination of Hindu and Muslim  cultures. What was left in place was the image of continual invaders coming to India.  SEPTEMBER 1994  Then came the dramatization of the  Ramayana. They interpreted the textâit's 18  volumes thick, so you can pick out of it  anything you want and what they picked  out was patriotic, militaristic, paternalistic,  patriarchal and casteist. The areas where  the Ramanaya was a well-read text among  the rural peasantry is the area where the  heaviest fundamentalist campaigns happened.  The south has still not been affected by  this Sangh Parivar onslaught because the  south has its own anti-Brahminical politics^âpopular consciousness is more against  the Brahmins than the Muslims.  When you look at all the different  levels, you begin to get the scope, contradictions and complexities of the situation. Modern Indian poverty and the incredible political and economic crisis that India has been  in over the last 10 years, has given a rich  ground for communalism and fundamentalism.  In Bombay, where riots never happened between Hindus and Muslims until  now, the areas targeted were where Muslims live. Lots of Muslims right now are  words, it is the elevation of a killer kind of  masculinity.  Jaffer: So where is the opposition to this  coming from? You say there's a strong opposition; what is it and where are women in  this whole equation?  Bannerji: There is a strong opposition.  This is where I think alternate mediaâbecause the mainstream media of the West will  never do itâhas to highlight the fact that  hundreds of thousands of people have not  agreed to [the fundamentalist agenda.] For  example, there have been all kinds of groups  of Muslims and Hindus together fighting  the aristocracy inside their own communities.  The present riot-mongeringhasalsohad  little appeal. The unsettlement or disarrangement of people's lives hasn't pleased people.  Yes, there are short bursts of violence, but  â¢there's no desire for a long term bloodbath  on the part of either ordinary Hindus or  ordinary Muslims. You can periodically stir  them up but you can't keep it going.  And the fact that [right-wing, fundamentalist parties] failed electorally [in the  last elections] in the places where they gen-  By saying that  [feminism is] not Indian  ignores the hundred years of women's struggle  and male reformers  who were pro-women's rights.  low-income people. The tailors, handicraft  workers, dayworkers, etcetera live in this  slum where Hindus and Muslims have lived  since the partition [of India in 1948]. The riot  didn't happen between the slumdwellers,  the riot happened against the slumdwellers  by upper-income housing estates and the  police. In February, 1993, this riot left quite  a lot of people dead and the area was completely devastated. Basically, they were trying to get rid of people from the slums to  take over the property.  There isagoodbookcalled KTiafa'S/iorfs,  Saffron Flags that talks about the organization of the RRS (Rashtrya Sawyam-Sevak  Sangha, the National Volunteers Association which is a para-military political party)  and BJP. It traces the roots back to the early  19th century, showing their interplay with  Indian politics and economics as the years  go by, culminating in the present state. It's  absolutecomplicity with foreign capital and  absolute anti-protest stand inside the country. They have used this idea of foreigner/  invader against anything that looks barely  progressive, ranging from being anti-trade  union, anti-Communist Party, anti-women's organizations, anti-civil rights, or anything that is even vaguely tolerant of class-  politics. Everything is named as foreignism  and therefore not nationalism.  Feminists, for example, are big enemies  of the Hindu nationalist fundamentalists  because they are foreign in their ideology.  That states obviously Hinduism means the  domination of women and whoever says it  doesn't must have learnt it abroad. By saying that's not Indian ignores the hundred  years of women's struggle and male reformers who were pro-women's rights. The  ideology of Mao and Marx and so on are  foreign too, so whoever's Lenin's son or  Mao's son is basically an enemy of the state  and of society.  Fundamentalism is also masculinity; it  attaches itself securely to the patriarchal  organization of a few thousand years and  valorizes that. A man who is a killer is a  hero. A man who disagrees with killing  Muslims becomes a feminized man. That's  the way men who are anti-communal are  described, as not being men. The heroic  man is this Brahminical casteist, militaristic, patriotic and patriarchal manâin other  erally formerly had strongholds makes me  think that there may not be as solid a ground  as they think.  There has been a lot of civil protest. As  well, there has been a lot of political protest  coming from the Leftist parties, not just  communist, but other progressive and left  parties. Trade unions have also been very  active. Women's groups have played an interesting grassroots role in the opposition.  Some, who aredirectly party-connected have  held their own campaigns. But those who  are not [connected to a political party] have  done campaign work on the ground.  As a whole, it's not game-over by any  means. I don't believe we will see a Sangh  Parivar India in the next 10 years, which is  what I thought was likely two years ago. In  areas that were former BJP strongholds, there  has been a lot written by va rious groups, and  the marches and the demonstrations and so  on that have taken place have lead me to  think this is by no means a settled and concluded story. It's not over yet.  The role the West will play will be very  crucial in that a lot of people are sending  money to India for the Sangh Parivar cause.  The American establishment has given it  some support as well. They were expecting  these [parties] would gain power [in the last  elections]~the parties do support a "free  market," privatization, foreign capital, and  so on and, at the same time, maybe have a  way to crush class and popular protest in  India. The West wanted the BJP to prove  themselves, and the BJP did not prove themselves as effectively as the West wanted  them to, so I'm not sure whether Western  support is as strong as it was in 1990.  However, the project of opening up  India [to the West], which combines privatization, foreign capitals, lack of reserve bank  laws, and so forth, may now have attached  itself to the [leading] Congress Party and  may have found in Congress its true ally. I  believe Congress has jockeyed some of the  forces of Western capital to its side.  The repression that the Congress can do  is sufficient unto itself. The labour movement is being effectively targeted by the state  and by new economic policies, where wages  are down, real wages are falling, trade union  protections are beginning to be eroded away  and breakdowns in the trade unions in different sectors is happening and so on.  There are many ways to skin a cat-there  are more roundabout, circuitous and structural ways of disorganizing a country than  having to have a big ideological, national  agenda. It's perfectly possible in the coming  10 or 15 years that, [while] we may not see a  Sangh Parivar government, we will see periodic upsurges of this kind, and coalitions  forming between Congress and the BJP, for  example. [They had a coalition] before this  riotious time, and they can do it again and  again, pulling in and pulling out. In a way,  that is more effective in terms of socio-eco-  nomicdisarrangementâwhatiscalled structural adjustment in Indiaâthan having a  national, sewn-up ideology against which  people can actually rise up in a concerted  way. Right now, you're fighting 10 battles.  And your energy is being dissipated in all  directions. But if you can make [the battle]  one, we could be more effective because  groups could join together. Instead, what is  going to happen is strategy of confusion, of  assault by erosion, rather than a kind of full  assault.  At the same time, I don't think the women's politic that's rising in India is a negligible politic at all. At present, thirty percent of  political sea ts have to be reserved for women  from the village government level, all the  way to the top. That means the vote of  women and their political participation has  becomeabigcatchment area for every political party. [As a result,] there's a very strong  demand for women's rights, women's necessities, women's basic needs, and so on,  from the ground level and then all the way  up. And this electorate [of women], and  these political officers are not going to be so  easily captured by the BJP-VHP, even if BJP  and VHP did have a women's wing and  tried, in a modifying way, to give certain  kinds of rights to women.  But they fall short when it comes to  issues of property, freedom of womenâ  abortion inlndia hasbeenlegal since the 50s.  There is now abortion on demand by constitution, but there was an attempt to rescind it  on the part of these partiesâthat has not  been taken kindly to by women. So this is a  major political wrench in the works.  Jaffer: Do women actually fill that 30  percent of seats?  Bannerji: Yes, the quota gets filled, less  at the national level, but more and more and  more every year. And in the villages of West  Bengal, for example, the village election is  important. Eighty percent of Indian people  still live in the villages of India, so the village  government is not negligible. It's the conduit  between the state policies and the local people. It has a hand in irrigation planning,  marketing, street distribution, trucking of  things, and the levy policies of grain by the  state. Village government is a powerful instrument and has been captured in most  places in West Bengal by the left. In other  places, it's by mixed groups of people, but  women, somehow, instinctively have drawn  more to the left and to progressive parties  than to the right. It's a life instinct really.  Women don't have to read a book about  what leftist policies are; they live the experience of having seen the Congress before,  having seen the Hindu Sangh Parivar element in their countryside.  We're at an interesting time where the  organized politics of the left may have become weaker in some ways, but the popular  politics from the [grassroots] has become  stronger. Where this formation in the end is  going to go, no-one knowsâit's a complicated and important time in India's history,  probably as important as around the time of  the independence movement and partition.  My hope lies on the ground, really, with the  women, with popular politics as well with  the left parties.

Lane shows with deft elegance how  apparently ordinary moments or scenes are the locus of great significance, both for our individual  lives and in a wider sense.

SEPTEMBER 1994 Letters  Kinesis loves receiving mail.  Please get your letter to us by the 18th  of the month.  If you can, keep the length to  about 500 words. (If you go way over,  we might edit for space.)  Hope to hear from you very soon.  Love,  Kinesis  Another time...  another Kinesis?  Kinesis:  Your monthly summary of twenty years  of Kinesis articles, and Esther's commentary  in the last issue, brought back many memories of working on Kinesis. It also made me  think about how we perceive our herstory  and keep our records. Who were the writers  and why did they do it? you asked.  My first article for Kinesis was in 1981,  I think. VSW was in a little second-floor  office by Chocolate Park when Tatyana  Mamova, the Russian dissident feminist,  came to visit us there. The "Women In Russia" supplement came out of that visit. When  she told us how there were no accessible  photocopiers in the Soviet Union, a lack of  typewriters, not even any carbon paper for  women to get their writing out to other  women, then we partly understood why we  were putting out Kinesis.  When I read your summary for the  month of March, 1982,1 came up blank. I  don't remember any one of those stories,  though I worked on all ten issues that year.  How we view that past has a lot to do with  who we are now. You are looking through  the eyes of 1994 and are moved by different  issues. Probably that's how it should be.  Was it 1982 that we published a supplement on incest? It encompassed all manner  of sexual abuse, and was honestly and vulnerably written by a survivors group. To my  knowledge, nothing like this had been published before in Canada, at that time.  Because this issue had only just started  to crack open, the particular piece about  ritual abuse did not get discussed by the  Kinesis working collective. We would have  been emotionally unprepared to deal with it.  Although I usually typed the final copy of  the paper, I remember the editor typed that  particular piece herself, I think, to divert  reaction and questions. When Kinesis appeared, I vividly remember that a feminist  friend of mine was appalled at the monstrous descriptions, which she did not believe to have geniunely occurred. It was only  by bringing the issue out into the open, that  others could come forward and recognize  the truth.  My most vivid memories are not reflected in your 20-year summary. Looking at  the remnants of the Social Credit Party now,  it's hard to believe the dramatic impact they  had on us, was it in 1983? Not just cuts to  funding, but viscious budget measures that  affected our homes, our wages, our human  rights. We didn't just report it in Kinesis. We  lived it.  In 1984, we produced a special issue on  the federal election. As a foray into electoral  politics, it was an interesting exercise. As a  popular item, it was a failure. Ironically, it  was one of the few issues that I remember as  being really funnyâmost of our humour  was at the expense of the tories! It probably  wasn't popular because a lot of guff is written at election time; everyone gets sick of it.  But also, because Kinesis moved away from  its roots, in movement struggles.  In editing the paper, I remember we  worked very hard to retain the honest voice  of women, as expressed by writers, themselves. Probably it was time to change, to  express all voices, not just the usual voices. I  believe that the incest suppliment was the  start of expressing voices that some were  afraid of, or found challenging.  There were lots of other challenges to  come, but that could be the subject of another article...  In retrospective mood,  Jan DeGrass  Gibsons, BC  The Editorial Board responds:  Thank you for your contribution to our  attempts this year at celebrating Kinesis' 20-  year-old herstory. We agree that contributors to  the 20th Anniversary pages in Kinesis tend to  look back at herstory through the eyes of 1994. In  fact, all contributors to those pages are still, to  varying degrees, part of shaping the Kinesis of  the 90s. While each contributor brings her own  particular interest to her coverage, contributions are also subjected to an edit according to  ourl 994 Editorial Policies and guidelines, which  reflect the priorities and politics of the 1994  Editorial Board. When we began the "20th Anniversary" column in our February issue, the  Editorial Board extended an invitation to  "Kinesisites" past and present to contact us  about contributions to the project. We take this  opportunity to repeat that invitation.  Co-op Radio  CFRO 102.7 FM  Listener Powered!  Community-Based!

Dare to reprint  Kinesis:  I've often wanted to write to the women  who work on this paper but the moment of  inspiration usually passes before I can put  pen to paper. Maybe that's what happens to  a lot of your readersâin that history of Kinesis  by Esther Shannon [see Kinesis, Jun/94J she  says Kinesis has always had that problem:  not getting enough letters. I don't write because I never get around to it, not because  I've nothing to say. However, thatarticle got  me thinking about writing this letter (though  to be honest, I'm writing mainly because it's  summertime, I'm on holiday, and I need to  do something that makes me feel useful.)  To get to the point, a few months back  you ran an interview with an Indian woman  on religious fundamentalism, focussing on  Hindu fundamentalism inlndia [seeKinesis,  Apr/94J. I know very little about what's going on there, even though I have read a lot of  newspaper stories about the riots and so on.  I'm a Black woman living in the States concerned about the rise of Christian fundamentalism here, and was really glad to see  someone progressive paying attention to how  religion is being used by the Right elsewhere  in the world. I'm sure you put the story on  your centre pages because you also realize  how important it was that women read about  what's really happemning. I give you credit  for that.  So why did you spoil it all by trying to  make the page look "pretty" by putting that  heavy colour/graphic all over the text? It  made it almost impossible to read. My eyesight is not the best and I have difficulty with  the size of your print anyway. Trying to read  that article gave me a giant headache. If you  really want to get the news out about this  subject, I suggest you change your  centrespread design. I know a few women  who read Kinesis out of a women's centre we  volunteer at, and they didn't bother to read  that piece because of the obtrusive blot of  colour on it. Do us and yourself a favour.  Dare to reprint it! And don't put colour over  text if you can help it.  My intentions are not merely to criticize. I really think Kinesis is great, and says  what few other publications dare. I send this  criticism and suggestion in the spirit of solidarity.  Diana Barrett  Cleveland, Ohio  The Editorial Board responds:  Since we published the article on religious  fundamentalism in the April issue of Kinesis,  the Editorial Board has received about eight  phonecalls, two letters (marked "notfor publication,") and numerous verbal requests to rerun  the article, for the reasons you mention. The  Kinesis Editorial Board appreciates the feedback  from Kinesis readers. The article appears in its  original form (minus the colour overlay) in this  issue [see page 14]. As to taking time out to  write to us, we thank you. We often receive  phonecalls from readers commenting on something we have or haven't done well-or at all-  and letters marked "not for publication." However, Kinesis works towards being a forum for  public debate among women, and letters to the  editor are usually an indication Kinesis is fulfilling this mandate.  INA DENNEKAMP  Piano Service  KARATE for WOMEN  if  WEEmmsmnn  Mon., Tues., Thurs. 7 pm  Fitness, self confidence,  self defense  ASK ABOUT BEGINNER CROUPS  Not inspired  by Kinesis  I've been a regular reader of Kinesis for  some time, But I have to confess when I've  read it of late I am not inspired, indeed I  sometimes have to stifle a yawn. Kinesis does  provide some information you can't find  elsewhere. But something's lacking. There's  no debate in these pages. We leam about  what nefarious schemes the corporate  agenda is up to, but there's few creative  suggestions and discussions of what action  to take. Kinesis seems to be anti a lot of  things, but what should activist women be  for? To be fair, this isn't a problem that  plagues just Kinesis. It seems on a lot of  issues which are complex and ambiguous,  "progressive" groups are silent, or fall back  on standard line, without thinking.  A case in point might be the local issue  of prostitution here in Vancouver. Some  residents of Mount Pleasant have organized  a campaign to force sex trade workers not to  work in their neighbourhood. A group, organized at least in part by the International  Socia lists, is opposing this "Shame the Johns"  campaign. (By the way, isn't it interesting  how the IS get so involved in leading campaigns on certain issuesâlesbian and gay  rights, prostitutes' rights-just when these  issues are in the media spotlight?)  While I think there definitely are criticisms to be made of the Mt. Pleasant group,  surely it's simplistic to dismiss these people  as "moralists," tell them they've got the  wrong analysis, prostitution doesn't cause  any of the problems they're concerned about,  and the sex trade is caused by poverty. These  things may be true in part, but:  1. the issue of prostitution is more complex than this, and isn't solely caused by  poverty; and  2. it is not productive to attack people's  attempts to deal with neighbourhood problems (even if these attempts are wrong) without trying to dialogue and encourage discussion to figure out better ways to address  these problems (and that means discussion,  not prescribing "correct" programs).

Kinesis could  contribute by covering a 11 sides (there's more  than two!) on this issue.  It's time for Kinesis to take some risks!  Yours in sisterhood,  Kate Austin  Vancouver, BC  The Kinesis Editorial Board responds:  All articles that appear in Kinesis are written by volunteer writers who either mail or bring  in stories unsolicited, attend a Writers' Meeting  (on thefirst Tuesday of every month) and discuss  a story they would like to write, or are solicited  by the Editorial Board to write on specific issues.  The agenda for what is published in KinesisÂ«Â«d  how is partly set by women who volunteer at the  paper, and partly by largely volunteer Editorial  Board. The only criterion is that articles meet  our editiorial policies and guidelines. While we  don't believe in "objective" journalism, we attempt to give all "sides" of an issue a chance to  respond, unless the side has already been more  than adequately covered in the mainstream media already. Kinesis is committed to facilitating  debate among feminists on issues of importance  to women, such as the "Shame the Johns" campaign in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood. We hope to carry an article on the  debate in an upcoming issue of Kinesis. The  Editorial Board would also like to suggest you  volunteer to write the story, time allowing,  because it is through the input of women like  yourself that Kinesis is the newspaper it is.  South Africa  coverage applauded  Thank you one thousand times for your  stories on South Africa [see Kinesis, Jun/94  and Jul/Aug 94.J I am from Africa myself, not  South Africa but Tanzania. I waited my  whole life for apartheid to be over. I don't  say "I am an activist" like the women in  Canada, but we, in African countries, did  many things to help our Black South Africans brothers and sisters.  During the elections in South Africa, I  listened to the news and I read many newspapers, including The New York Times. If it  was not for my friends and family here in  Vancouver, I would have felt very alone  with or far from what was happening there.  Then my friend gave me Kinesis, which had  eight pages on South Africa on women and  what it was like there [during the April  election.]  Maybe because all eight pages carried  African voices, African stories, I could finally rejoice. Some of the TV interviews with  South Africans were like that, but mostly  they didn't ask them what I wanted them to.  But I think because Fatima Jaffer and L.  Muthoni Wanyeki were Africans, they asked  them what I wanted to hear. So I thank you.  At last I could celebrate.  I also want to say that your second  special on South Africa was not as strong,  but it was also very interesting. The article by  Mmatshilo Motsei was so good. She reminds  me of my aunties. And the lesbian stories  were interesting too. I don't know any lesbians here but in Tanzania, they did not call  themselves lesbians. I think [lesbians] are  very brave, maybe the most revolutionary  women in our society today, and lam happy  to see they are so strong in South Africa.  Thank you,  Anastia Kamau  Surrey, BC  The Editorial Board responds:  Thanks for your comments. The members of  the Editorial Board felt we were taking a risk by  running two eight-page supplements on South  Africa, but felt unanimously that the victory of  the an ti-apartheid movements merited the space  in Kinesis. We're glad you agree.  Kinesis  messes me up  Kinesis:  Why does the ink used to print the  paper come off on my hands? Every time  I've picked up a Kinesis this year, my already-not-sparkling-clean hands have been  covered in powdery black ink that comes off  everywhere (but is quite partial to the more  noticable portions of my face).  This brings me to another pressing question which I hope you can answer. Why  doesn't anyone ever tell you when you've  got smudges of inky fingerprints on your  face? Do people assume that because they're  there that you did it on purpose? Do they  think it's a statement of my personal  indentity, that I have painstakingly decorated my face with ink fingerprints? If Icame  to volunteer during production, would someone tell me if I have ink on my face before I  left? Is newspaper ink good for your skin  and if it is, could I come down for some back-  issues?  Before I started writing this, I hesitated  because I thought it might be trivial, or at the  very least, silly. But then I thought, "Hey,  this is not just another paper. My concerns  won't yet again be dismissed by a newspa  per! " So I wrote you this little whining letter  to let you know about my concerns and  because I know you'll print it.  Yours in brazen (though slightly  smeared) outspokenness,  Choot Boli  Burnaby, BC  The Editorial Board responds:  Kinesis changed printers almost one year  agoandhas since receiveda number of comments  about the excessive inkiness of the paper. Our  printers tell us the ink will tend to come off on  yourhands ifwepublish cover photographs that  require large areas of black ink. They suggest  using a better (more expensive) stock of newsprint could help alleviate the problem. While, it  is unlikely Kinesis will be able to afford a better  stock ofnewsprin t, we are attempting to negotiate changes with our printers.  We are unable to tell you whether the ink is  actually good for your complexion (we doubt it,  though it is supposed to be "non-toxic") but the  ink is made from vegetable-based oils and is  unlikely to be any more toxic than some of the  substances we breathe in daily. If you indeed  discover it is good for you r complexion, please let  us know. We would also be more than happy to  supply you with back issues o/Kinesis (at $2.25  a copy, or what you can afford.) And we can  assure you that when you come in to work on  production o/Kinesis, you will not be alone in  your "slightly smeared" splendour. If you wish,  we could make it a point to notice and point out  the smudges on your face but cannot guarantee  we'll do the same for the piece of line-tape stuck  on your fingernail or the bluepencil sticking out  from behind your ear.
