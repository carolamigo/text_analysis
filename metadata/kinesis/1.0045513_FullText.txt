In January 1976, she was  fired due to pregnancy. Bliss complained to the B.C.Human Rights Commission who ordered the car dealership to reinstate her. She returned  to work until March 1976, leaving  a few days before the birth of her  child.  By that time, Bliss had worked far  more than long enough to qualify  for regular UIC payments, had she  not been pregnant. Six days after  childbirth she was able and willing to work, but unable to find  a job. Bliss applied for regular,  not maternity benefits, and was  denied.  UIC stipulates that a woman must  be working at the time of conception in order to qualify for maternity benefits. By chauvinist  reasoning, this is presumably  to stop the "abuse" of UIC by women who become pregnant intentionally so they can collect UIC!  Bliss never claimed maternity benefits, only regular UIC payments.  But if pregnant women are not  eligible for maternity benefits,  which are restrictive to begin  with, they are simply disqualified, period. They may not apply  for regular UIC benefits.  When Bliss was disentitled by UIC,  she appealed the decision and won  her case. The judge ruled that  Section 46 of the UIC Act, which  is the Catch 22 for pregnant  workers, discriminates by sex and  is therefore contrary to the Canadian Bill of Rights.  In making this challenge, Stella  Bliss had the support of her union  the Service, Office and Retail  Workers' Union of Canada (SORWUC).  UIC appealed this decision, presumably hoping to overturn the  judgement against the system.  The UIC appeal took place at the Federal Court of Appeals in Vancouver on  May 18.  The UIC lawyer argued that section 46  is not sexist, that it does not discriminate between'women and men. He  maintained that it discriminates between "classes" of women : pregnant  and non-pregnant women.  Bliss' lawyer arged that section 46  is sexist because it disqualifies  women for a condition to which they  are susceptible by reason of sex.  He noted that men who are subject to  similar disabilities with predictable time limits, like prostatectomies, may apply for regular UIC  benefits, if they do not qualify  under the "sickness" benefits. Thus,  he maintained, pregnant women who  don't qualify for maternity benefits ought to be able to apply  for regular benefits.  Bliss' lawyer said that while it is  not acceptable to discriminate on  the basis of sex, it is also not  acceptable to discrimination between members of the same sex, as  a separate "class" and referred to  The Abbotsford Women's Festival,  organized by the Fraser Valley  Women's Coalition in conjunction  with Fraser Valley College, took  place Friday May 13 and Saturday,  May 14.  About 100 women and men took part  in the Festival on Friday, and  300 people attended during Saturday. The conference's key-note  speaker was Gene Errington, who  spoke about women's place in society, and the ways in which our  continued oppression serves the  economy. Workshops on numerous  topics were a feature of Saturday's events. Some of the areas  covered were: self-defense; lesbian feminism; use of power tools;  car repairs, assertiveness for  women, astrology, journal-writing  and consciousness raising.  "The festival was a real success",  said one of the Fraser Valley women  who worked to organize the event.  "But one problem became clearer  than ever - it is just about impossible to organize a festival which  reaches all women - women who have  been in the movement for ten years  have different expectations from  those who are just becoming involved."  an American precedent in support  of his argument.  Bliss' lawyer noted that women are  arbitrarily forced to leave their  employment for a certain period of  time while pregnant, despite the  fact that most of them are able to  work right up to and immediately  following childbirth. He implied  that pregnant women are penalized  by UIC maternity benefits.  As spectators in the court-room,  Vancouver Status of Women formed  the following impressions of  the proceedings:  The three federal court of appeal  judges, all white males, seemed  to us to have already made up their  minds against Bliss.  The central judge repeatedly said  that her lawyer had not convinced  him that she was entitled to regular  UIC benefits. And by the smile on  his face, he seemed to us to be  proud of that fact.  Bliss' lawyer attempted to make his  point five times, which gave us  the impression that perhaps the  judge did not want to understand  and wanted to make a fool of him.  The panel of three judges made  asides to one another under their  breath, after which they would  laugh at some sort of in-joke.  If the umpire's decision is now  reversed, it will be a blow for  all working women. If/when we  become pregnant, UIC then uses  that fact to deny us benefits to  which we would otherwise be  entitled.  At the time this article goes to  press, the decision has not been  declared. Perhaps Bliss cannot  win her case as the law stands.  In that case, the law must be  changed, and that is not the job  of the judges.  by Karen Richardson.

Right? We have  salaries, albeit thin ones, and  goddess knows salaries are like  gold dust these day. Right?  How do we print Kinesis? Now that's  another story.  Kinesis is printed from membership  donations. We try to print it as  cheaply as possible. And that means  we have to get it printed on a huge  press specifically geared to cheap  tabloid productions.  But this press will print a minimum  of 2,000 copies. By the time they  have the plates set and the buttons  pushed, it costs too much for them  to run any fewer.  This is what the trouble is all  about. We cannot get rid of all  those copies.  We only have about 1,000 going out  each month.  Here's where you come in, if we are  going to survive.  By dint of various stratagems and  elegant costing, we have managed  to pull our expenses down to this:  based on 1,000 copies, Kinesis  costs $9.12 per year per subscription.  One thing is clear: we can't leave  those subs, for individuals at $5.00  if we want to stick around. Which we  do.  We keep going around and around this  issue at Kinesis: WE MUST FIND MORE  SUBSCRIBERS! WE MUST PULL THE COST  OF PRODUCING KINESIS per year per  sub. DOWN by finding more subscribers.  If we sold all 2,000 copies, our  costs would be $4.56 per year per sub.  Magazines have a habit of dying of  exhaustion. THE OTHER WOMAN, the  Toronto feminist newspaper, died  at the age of five.  Please find some more subscribers for  Kinesis. Please.  LETTER  Dear Editors and Staff:  I feel that this is the time to  start a federal lobbying via province wide or even nation-wide women's groups, on one or two specific issues (which everyone agrees  to stick to). There are of course  many issues affecting women which  are federal in nature: abortion,  human rights, (federal) labour  code, funding, general employment,  pensions and so forth.  While abortion and the B C-25,  Human Rights legislation are most  timely, I feel strongly that a  lobbying to improve taxation  regulations that presently discriminate against the working  poor and women requiring childcare  of any kind is needed. Would the  B.C.F.W be interested in endorsing such a concerted effort to  lobby MP's in each provincial  riding of B.C.? Are there any  persons who would like to work  on such an undertaking during the  summer.  Yours Truly,  Nina Westaway  47-4340 Steveston Hwy.  Richmond, B.C. V7E 2K3  271-9186  *&  Education Officer  Vancouver Status of Women  2029 West 4th Ave  Dear Ms.Allen,  Many of us girls in Baker Drive  Elementary School would like  to complain about a book called  ACCENT ON READING. 47 out of  the 51 stories in the book are  about boys. Everything that a  boy has done in all the stories  a girl can do just as well.  So why does the hero always  have to be a boy in all the  stories? We girls feel that there  should be a book put out with  the same amount of stories for  boys and girls because there is  the same number of boys and  girls in the whole world. Is  there such a book that could  be put out as a reader for  Grade 7's? Even if we will not  be at this school next year  or when ever the book does come  out (if there is one) we are  doing this for the other students that become Grade 7's.  If you can take a little of  your time and write us a short  note back we would be very happy  to hear from you.  Yours sincerely,  Wendy Sears and Kim Hampton  885 Baker Drive  Coquitlam B.C.  FILL OUT THE SUB FORM  FOR A FRIEND TODAY CANADA WORKS  Ts'aiku  Women's Centre  BURNS LAKE - Ts'aiku Women's Centre  has received Canada Works funding.  The centre, which began in November  1976 on a LIP grant, is unique in  B.C., having had the involvement  and participation of both native  and white women since its inception. Four of the women are white;  three are native.  The Ts'aiku women have fought hard  for this funding. They were initially  told they had been refused Canada  Works because they had previously  operated on a LIP project. It was  feared that they would become  dependent on grants, the funding  authorities said.  The grant is due to commence on  August 22nd. It will provide six  workers with six months' employment.  The workers will carry on the numerous activities already set up  by their centre. Joyce Hamilton  of the Centre, gives the following  description of what they do:  In the few months that we have been  in operation, we have accomplished  a great deal. We have had several important workshops: Kathleen Ruff, speaking on Human Rights; Marie Mitchell  (of Sec.State) aiding us with organizational skills; Diana Bissell (of  ditto) gearing us up on verbal self-  defense, and Di Russell from Vancouver  Rape Relief informing us on rape  myths, procedures and prevention. On  April 25, Georgia Edworthy will  speak on Learning Barriers for Native Children, and on May 18 and 19  the Vancouver Health Collective  demonstrated how to do breast and  cervical self-examinations.  Our ongoing programs are numerous:  a weekly column in the local newspaper, a weekly 5 minute show on  the local radio station, Keep Fit  classes twice weekly in the women's  gym we've fixed up in the basement of the centre, craft day every  Thursday, CR group and Mothers'  Time Out on Wednesdays, a babysitter  referral service, individual instruction in reading and writing  for illiterate women, a group  for young Carrier women aged 14-  16, and a program of coordinating  volunteers to visit and help out  in the senior citizens' home and  the day care centre. We have just  started our self-help group for  battered wives - the problem which  comes to our attention most often.  The centre has had an incredible response so far. We have 506 adult visitors in the month of March alone,  and our village only has a population  of around 1700! We have received  correspondence and visitors from  Whitehorse to Edmonton to Minneapolis!  Campbell River  Campbell River Women's Centre has  received a summer employment grant  to hire student researchers. The  researchers will investigate the  needs of the area for a Transition  House. For more information about  TRANSITION HOUSE project, you can  contact the Campbell River Women's  Centre at 923 Island Hwy; Campbell  River B.C.  VSW  Vancouver Status of Women is happy  to announce that we have received  a Canada Works Grant from the  Federal Government. This grant will  involve the hiring of six workers  for an eight month period for research into what's been done prov-  incially in terms of legislative  reform concerning women.  The research will be used by VSW  and by other women's groups in B.C.  to put pressure on the provincial  government. For details about the  grant, call us at 736 3746.  Prince George  Prince George Women's Centre has  received a Canada Works grant.  The grant will enable the centre  to hire five workers for eight  months.  Some workers are being  hired to teach silk-screening skills.  Another is to develop an ombuds  counselling service. One worker  will act as coordinator and one  will begin research into the  economic/sociological conditions  of women's employment in Prince  George. For more details about the  grant, you can contact the Prince  George's Women's Collective, at  1306, 7th Ave, Prince George.  Child Stolen  On Wednesday, May 18, David Waddle-  ton was taken from his mother's home.  David is almost three.  Janice Waddleton, David's mother,  has since learned that he was taken  by his father to Paris.  Now Janice Waddleton has to go to  France, to fight the battle in the  courts. She will need about $2,000  for airfare and court costs. The  Full Circle Coffeehouse is organizing a benefit to help cover Janice's  costs. DONATIONS can be sent to  VSW, 2029 W.4th att: David Fund.  Matrimonial Property  Attorney General of B.C., Garde Gardom, announced May 19 that he would  introduce a Matrimonial Property  bill in the legislature, when the  session reopens.  Gardom also said that the thrust  of the legislation would be to  guarantee community of property  distribution after breakup of  marriage.  In addition, the bill would include  tougher laws for making fathers pay  up.  If this bill contains these provisions, then the idea of dependency  will be merely reinforced. No community of property act will be adequate until it operates from the  beliefs, set out in the Berger  Report on Matrimonial Property:  1. All persons should be equal under  the law.  2. Marriage is a partnership of  shared responsibilities.  3. The roles of economic provider  and homemaker are of equal value  to the relationship.  4. Married women are economically  competent.  Sexual Orientation  Bill C25  Justice Minister Ron Basford spoke  in Vancouver during May about the  proposed Human Rights legislation -  Bill C 25.  The lecture was organized by the  Women's Resources Centre of the  UBC Department of Continuing Education.  During the course of the question  period, a representative from  the Gay Alliance Towards Equality  questioned Basford about the non-  inclusion of sexual orientation  along with race, religion, colour,  ancestry or place of origin as  being a category against which  discrimination is forbidden.  It seemed clear to members of the  audience from VSW that Basford  will not include sexual orientation  in Bill C 25 unless pressured immed-  ately by all concerned members of  the community.  Gay Demonstration  In recent weeks, homosexuals in Vancouver have been subject to police  harassment, arrests and official  condemnation. In response to this,  the Gay Alliance Towards Equality  'Ģ (GATE) has called a public rally  to be held at the courthouse, Sat.  June 4, from noon until 2pm.  Vancouver Status of Women supports  this expression of gay anger, and  protests the current police campaign. Attend the rally as an indication that you support equality  of human rights for the whole  community, regardless of sexual  orientation. A VSW member will  be speaking, and lesbian-feminist  music is also scheduled. For info,  call 732 6017 or 876 8384.  Culhane Trial  Claire Culhane, of the Prisoners'  Rights Group, goes to trial June 9  for "Illegal Trespass on Penitentiary Land". Trial begins 10.00 am  at the New Westminster Courthouse,  6th and Royal. Attend the trial to  express solidarity with the work  of the prisoners' rights movement.  The Prisoners' Rights Group have  planned a WEEK OF CONCERN for June  2-9. For information about proposed  activities, call the group at  873 8786 Or 299 7178. Unemployment, childcare, and funding  of women's centres: these were the  issues raised in a brief presented  to a Liberal mini-caucus when it  was in Richmond-Delta recently.  The brief had the support of a wide  coalition of women's groups within  the area and was presented by Joan  Wallace, member of the Advisory  Council on the Status of Women.  Groups involved in the brief were:  Delta Women's Centre; Delta Status  of Women; Richmond Women's Liberal  Commission; Richmond NDP Women's  Committee; Richmond Women's Resource  Centre; University Women's Club  of Delta and University Women's  Club of Richmond.  Those wishing to find out what was  said about unemployment and about  the funding of women's centres  could contact Delta Women's Centre.  Daycare Facilities:  Deficiencies Enormous  The following are excerpts from  the brief concerning childcare.  The newsletter of the National Day  Care Information Centre of Health  and Welfare Canada says in its  summer 1976 issue:  It is estimated that as of March  31, 1975  - 17.2% of the children aged 3 to 5  of working mothers are enrolled in  day care;  - 4.3% of children under age 3 of  working mothers are enrolled in day  care;  - .3% of children 6 and over, but  under 15, of working mothers are  enrolled in daycare.  Another study, "600,000 Children",  prepared by Phillip Hepworth of  the Canadian Council on Social  Development, estimates that in 1973  there were 643,000 working mothers  with children in the 0 to 5 age  group. At the same time there were  only 26,500 children in full daycare in 1973 and approximately 50,  000 more in half-day or part-day  programs.  The report continues:  Clearly, the deficiency of day care  facilities is enormous* A quarter  of the children under six have working mothers so there is an immediate  demand for more than 600,000 full-  time day care over the 26,500 in  1973...  In addition to the problem caused  by the acute shortage of day care  spaces, the subsidy provided to parents under the Canada Assistance  Plan has become inadequate as a  result of the rising costs of running day care centres.  THE HIGH  COSTOF  CHILDCARE  A committee of the B.C.Assoc, of  Social Workers, in a brief to the  B.C. government in November 1976  said:  Day care is becoming an unafford-  able commodity for many low income  families, forcing them to make less  than adequate arrangements for the  care of their children while they  work.  Parents find that current subsidies  per child often do not cover the  actual costs of care and parents  must make up the difference ...  The brief then made the following  recommendations:  1. Day care facilities should be  considered as an educational and  social service to children, not as  a service to parents.  2. To increase the number of day  care centres, the federal government  should cover a far greater share of  the capital costs of setting up new  centres.  3. Day care should be provided on  a 24 hour basis where the need exists  to care for children of parents on  shift work.  i. Day care should be available at  least one day per week to children  Df mothers who have chosen to remain  in the home rather than enter the  work force.  5. The sliding scale of subsidies  to parents should be adjusted to  cover the actual costs of day care.  Because of the increasing costs of  day care, a sole support mother is  often better off financially to  go on welfare than to find a job  and put her children in day care.  6. The federal government should  investigate the possibility of  providing tax incentives to companies which provide day care for  children of employees.  7. Federal and provincial grants to  day care centres should provide for  a decent wage for day care workers.  The low wages they are now receiving  are forcing these workers to subsidize a service that should be  provided by the government.  8. As a long-term proposal, the  federal.government should initiate  a federal-provincial study of the  feasability of transferring day care  from its present position as a part  of the welfare system to the educational system.  The government should recognize  the need to establish day care as  a universal service, freely available to all children, just as  high schools and kindergartens,  once the priviledge of the wealthy,  are now available to all.  Liberals  The B.C.Women's Liberal Commission  Annual General Meeting  By Karen Richardson  The B.C.Women's Liberal Commission  held its annual general meeting  in Vancouver on April 29 and 30,  1977 to elect new executive, formulate policy and discuss feminism  with federal officials. It was  attended by approximately 75 women.  Kilby Day, re-elected as President  for a second term, noted in her annual report that no women had attended  to March 1977 federal policy workshop as representatives of the B.C.  Women's Liberal Commission (BCWLC)  Day stressed the need for BCWLC representatives to attend the Ottawa policy workshop of the Liberal Party this  fall, to make their demands heard.  She also said that the BCWLC is urging  the provincial govt, to adopt the  Berger recommendations on marital  property, and that the BCWLC would  be monitoring the first year of  the federal Human Rights Bill.  A number of officials attended the  BCWLC annual general meeting, including the Hon.Ron Basford, Minister of  Justice, Gordon Gibson (Liberal Party  Leader, B.C.) B.C.Senator Ray Perr-  ault and Paul Plant, the Federal Liberal Party organizer.  Panelists included: Blooma Appel, Liaison Officer, Patrice Merrin, Exec.  Assistant - both work for Marc Lalonde, the Minister reponsible for  the Status of Women  BASFORD  Basford lauded the inclusion of equal  pay for work of equal value (see the  critique of this in February's Kinesis) in the soon-to-be-passed Biil  C 25, the Federal Human Rights Bill.  Basford also claimed that the women's  movement has no cause for pessimism,  reciting numerous changes in the  status of women over recent years,  in the face of a slow political process.  GIBSON  Gordon Gibson, leader of the B.C  Liberals and MLA for Vancouver—Capilano, spoke on the need for Canadian constitutional reform, and presented the BCWLC president Kilby  Day with a Canadian flag at the end  of his speech. He urged the liberal  women to adopt a comprehensive women's platform so the Liberals would  "win the next B.C.election".  BLOOMA APPEL  Blooma Appel spent more time discussing the national unity 'crisis' than  feminism. She asked women to set  aside justified 'gripes' and turn  their attention to Quebec because 'she  rages inside'.  PATRICE MERRIN  Patrice Merrin urged the Liberal women to demand action of the federal  government. Merrin said that is is  important to continue to letter lobby,  although it is hard to determine how  successful it is. She also quipped  that even in her position as special  advisor on women's issues, she still  must make sure that the Minister has  the right cufflinks on for special  speeches. Badgley Comm: BENIGN NEGLECT  The general attitude of the government and the Badgley Commission is  one of "benign neglect" on the issue  of Canadian abortion laws, say representatives of the Ottawa chapter  of the Canadian Association for  the Repeal of the Abortion Law (CARAL).  "The Commission's data is at odds  with its conclusions," charged  Chapter secretary John Baglow in a  recent interview. "The findings of  the Badgley report show overwhelming evidence that the abortion law  is not operating equitably across  Canada, but opinion surveys included in the report do not support  that evidence."  The federal government's fact-finding study, carried out by the Badgley  Commission, was conducted, "to determine whether the procedure provided  in the Criminal Code foroobtaining  therapeutic abortions is operating  equitably across Canada." The Commission's report was released recently and information included is  based on several surveys and site  visits.  Surveys Questioned  Baglow and CARAL chapter president,  Ruth Miller, said opinion surveys  should not have been included in  the report, and seriously question  some of the surveys' results. Not  only are they contradictory to  other opinion polls conducted in  recents years, but they contradict  the Commission's evidence.  A 1974 poll, for example, showed  62% of the Canadian people favouring freedom of choice, while one  Badgley survey shows only 46%.  "Already the right-to-lifers are using  this study's conclusions on public opinion," said Miller.  "Who cares if some people think abortions are too easy to get," she said,  referring to another Badgley survey.  "The evidence shows that they are not  too easy to get. In some provinces,  abortions are almost impossible to  secure, and, where abortions can be  obtained, a woman waits an average of  eight weeks."  CARAL says the Canadian people have the  evidence and that their elected representatives should act on it.  "But they won't", says Miller, "because*  the MPs are chicken-hearted. They don't  want to offend anyone."  Baglow believes the Badgley Commission  should have been allowed to address itself to some of the problems within the  abortion law. "For example, one of the  criteria for obtaining a therapeutic  abortion is based on the woman's health"  he said.  "There is not a standard definition of  a 'woman's health'. Some doctors define it only on a physical plane, others  use the mental and emotional," he said.  If there is not a standard definition  of health, he questions how there  can be a standard of equity in carrying out the abortion law.  CARAL believes that a woman should be  able to have freedom to choose whether  or not to continue an unwanted pregnancy, and that the restrictive abortion  laws, far from solving the problem,  "are merely making it worse."  Everyone's Responsibility  "Not enough has been said about the  whole basis of a law like this," said  Miller. "It is a law that allows other  people to make decisions about women's  lives." She said no other operation  is performed on this basis, and the  decision should only be between the  patient and her doctor.  "I'm in favour of big healthy babies  who have a good start in life. I do  not favour abortion as a means of  contraception. Nobody does. But I  do favour freedom of choice in planning one's family," said Miller.  "You can't be pro-women's liberation  and not allow freedom of choice",  she concluded. "If you do, you are  willing to sacrifice women for an  abstract ideal. But life is real living  people, with real living problems  that need real solutions."  Because quality of life is everyone's  issue, CARAL believes, everyone must  take a responsibility in expressing  their views whether or not they are  in a situation to be affected by the  present abortion law. (excerpted from  an interview by Pat Daley, in UPSTREAM)  la  What if you called a demonstration  and EVERYBODY wanted to come?  This is what happened with plans  made by the Downtown Eastside  Residents' Association (DERA).  They had organized a demonstration  for Dominion Day, July 1st, at  Vander Zalm's home in Surrey.  But they received so many calls  people and groups wishing to take  part that they recognized that  DERA could not be responsible for  a huge crowd. Who knows what might  happen to the tulips in those  Surrey gardens?  The demonstrators planned to make  the following demands, of which  VSW is in full support:  * comfort allowances should be increased for persons in institutions  and extended care facilities who  need it.  * income assistance rates for singles  should be increased to $240; for  couples to rate should be $340;  * all income assistance for singles  and couples should be tied to the  Consumer Price Index;  * all persons in receipt of income  assistance should be eligible for  100% shelter overages (including  utilities);  * the four months' waiting period  for increased basic rates of income  assistance should be eliminated;  On April 21st, Human Resources Minister  Vander Zalm announced that income assistance for single persons would be  increased by $15. This is pitiful, to  put it politely.  The $15 increase is less than 10% over  three years, since the last increase.  In that same period, the cost of  living has gone up 24.7%. Put it together yourself: the standard of living for people on social assistance  has been sinking year by year.  VANDER ZALM'S COMMENT OF THE MONTH,  or, OVERHEARD AT THE TURKEY FARM:  Feminists rose one morning in May  to hear Vander Zalm explaining on  the radio that our unemployment  figures are artificially inflated  by married women.  The implication is that married women should be supported by their  husbands; that they only work for  pin money; that they are taking jobs  away from unemployed men; that they  have no right to work. 6  FEMINIST ISSUES  RAPE  husband as rapist  NEW YORK (LNS)" - A Newark, New Jersey  judge has ruled that a man cannot be  charged with raping his wife.  Essex County Court Judge Nicholas  Scalera dismissed a rape indictment  against a New Jersey man on the  grounds that New Jersey's 1898 rape  law effectively grants a husband absolute right to relations with his  wife. The man, Albert Smith, is also  charged with impairing the morals of  his two young children. Smith was  charged when he broke into his estranged wife's home, raped and beat  her while the children watched.  Upon dismissing the rape indictment,  Judge Scalera said that a husband  cannot be prosecuted for rape when  he is "still legally married to his  wife, unless there is a judicial  order for separation or divorce.  SOUTH AUSTRALIAN legislators are de-'  bating a new law which not only expands the state's definition of rape  and revises other laws on sexual offences, but also makes provisions,  for a husband to be indicted for  raping his wife.  Conservative groups object that the  law would be impossible to enforce,  that it would destroy the institution  of marriage by bringing the law  into the bedroom, and that it would  place a powerful weapon in the hands  of a "vindictive wife."  Two houses for battered wives have  relased case stories: they told of  women being raped in front of their  children, being violated with broken  bottles, being beaten with broomsticks  etc.  In passing the bill, the Upper House  amended it to say a rape-in-marriage  charge will lead to trial if there  is actual force (?) to the victim,  her relatives or children.  NAC CrStoraska's Rim  The film, "How to Say No to a Rapist and Survive", and any federal  agencies purchasing and showing it  have been censured by the National  Action Committee on the Status of  Women. At its annual conference in  Ottawa, March 18-21, NAC said that  "the film is both sexist in its portrayal of males and females and filled with errors in the information it  gives about rape." The film advises  that women offer no physical resistance to the attacker. It is shown  widely throughout Canada.  STERILIZATION  usa  Charging that the method is increasingly forced on unwilling women, particularly third world and poor women,  progressive groups have launched a  campaign against sterilization abuse.  A major focus of this campaign is  currently in New York City, where  a bill has been introduced into the  New York City Council that would limit  forcible sterilization of women and  men, and sterilization without informed consent by the patient. The outcome  of the bill, as well as the sterilization abuse campaign, will have far-  ranging effects in terms of defeating  sterilization attacks on women.  One of the most active opponents of  the New York bill has been Planned  Parenthood, who downplay the legitimate  sterilization concerns of third world  women.  NEW YORK (LNS) - Over a four year  period in the U.S., the Indian Health  Service has sterilized 3,400 American  Indian women without obtaining proper  consent from many of them and without  telling many of the women that the  operations were not necessary.  All of the women were between the  ages of 15 and 44; 36 were under 21,  despite a court-ordered moratorium  on sterilizations of people younger  than 21.  These illustrations are part of a pamphlet produced   by the HEW Dept.  to induce native people  to have less children so that they will become  wealthy.    The net result seems that parents end  up with neither children,  riches, nor future instead.     "Women who are poor don't get rich by  having their tubes tied," says Dr.   Constance Uri,  a Native American physician.        —off our backs  from THE GUARDIAN  ABORTION  SqsK  Saskatoon - Saskatoon Women's Liberation has called for the resignations  of the provincial ministers of health  and social services following their  recent statements against abortion.  The statement followed federal Justice Minister Ron Basford's announcement that he would be meeting with  provincial governments to discuss  more equitable abortion policies  as a response to the Badgely Report  on the operation of the abortion  law.  "If the opportunity isn't there for  abortions to be had, that's fine...  and I would do nothing to make it  more equitable in that sense," the  Sask. minister of health said.  But the women's group commented:  "the callous dismissal of the rights  of women in this province to safe,  legal abortions is truly shocking.  f,As reponsible cabinet ministers,  it is their duty and obligation to  make sure the laws of this country  are carried out fairly and equitably.  Their biased statements have made  it apparent that they have no intention of doing so." (Upstream)  Morgentaler  Dr.Henry Morgentaler has reopened  his abortion clinic in Montreal  with assurances from the Quebec  justice minister that doctors performing legal abortions will not  be prosecuted.  He has begun to bill Quebec medicare for the expenses of his patients. As yet he has received no  indication that the bills will .be  paid.  Morgentaler has stated that he intends to train doctors in his  clinic and has also offered his  facilities as a training centre  to the Minister for social services.  Speaking at the annual meeting of  the Canadian Association for the  Repeal of the Abortion Law (CARAL),  Morgentaler said that the federal  abortion law is dead in Quebec &  the findings of the Badgely Commission suggest that it should be  dead in the rest of the country.  He said that "the federal government has sacrificed the interests  of women on the altar of political  / expediency." (Upstream).  Caught in the Crunch  OTTAWA - May 10. The federal government has finally decided that 18,000  people over age 65 will be awarded  money owed them by the Unemployment  Insurance Commission for more than  a year.  The people involved were cut off UIC  benefits in January of 1976 when the  government brought in amendments to  the UIC act, removing people over  age 65 from the program. United Bank  Workers  -SORWUC  If you have been reading KINESIS  over the past few months, you will  know already that the Service, Office and Retail Workers' Union of  Canada (SORWUC) has been organizing bank workers in B.C. The bank  workers have now formed their own  local of SORWUC, and they are known  as THE UNITED BANK WORKERS, Local  2 of SORWUC.  A crucial issue in the organizing  of banks is to determine which is  the appropriate bargaining unit -  is it a single branch, a nationwide unit, or something in between?  The Canada Labour Relations Board  (the C.L.R.B) is the group which  makes the ruling about this.  The newsletter of the United Bank  Workers, THE MONTHLY STATEMENT, has  a very complete coverage of all these  issues, and others.. Here Kinesia  will report only upon the third  issue, and recommend that interested  readers contact the United Bank  Workers (at #1116 - 207 W. Hastings,  Vancouver,  684 2834)for more info.  THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE UNIT  SORWUC did not call witnesses in  this area, but simply asked -  why isn't the branch the appropriate unit?  The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, represented by the lawyer,  Mr.Hicks, brought forward several  bank professionals, all male, all  from the Toronto area. Two of them  had a combined total of 67 years  with the bank, both starting at  the bottom, and neither being held  back by sexist discrimination.  They were, as the United Bank Workers report states, "apparently  HUtoiy  On Monday, April 18, the United  Bank Workers began their hearings  with the Canada Labour Relations  Board (C.L.R.B). They were putting  the case that the branch should be  the appropriate bargaining unit,  and that banks must be able to organise branch by branch.  On the other side were representatives  of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (C"I.B.C.) who argued that the  national unit is the only appropriate  bargaining unit.  The hearings concerned themselves  with the eight applications for  certification put forward by SORWUC  for the eight branches cf the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The  decision upon these C.I.B.C. branches  will assumedly act as precedents  for other applications on behalf of  workers at other B.C. banks.  The United Bank Workers (SORWUC's  local #2) identify the following as  the major issues:  the major issues  1. How should evidence of employer  involvement in anti-union activities  be presented, if at all?  2. Did we violate our constitution  by applying for branches in the name  of the National Union when a Local  had been chartered?  3. Is the branch an appropriate  bargaining unit? If not, does the  Canada Labour Relations Board have  an obligation to name one?  united  bank  workers  apply for  ertification  chosen to testify because of their  impressive (i.e. Toronto based)  positions and exhibited more loyalty to the Bank than knowledge about  the normal operation of the branch!"  One professional, Duffield, "performed nicely, stressing how terribly national everything in the banking industry is." But he was , explain the Bankworkers, "equally cooperative with our lawyer in establishing the near total autonomy of  the branch." So much for Duffield.  Then the C.I.B.C. called upon a  Fr.Cotton, who was careful to stress  t. at the manager has absolutely no  influence on changing her/his branch  complement, while at the same time  justifying an abrupt increase in  one branch's complement from 6 to  10 by the fact that the manager discovered a heavy workload, and overly  long hours.  It was a contradiction  that did no go unnoted by the SORWUC  lawyers.  The final witness for the Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce was one  Mr.White, a systems specialist who  came equipped with a massive"chart.  He knew all about how items move  through the system. But he did not  know what effect a postal strike  would have on his system, much.less  a bank strike (or a natural disaster) " He didn't know if the bank  had ever had their computer services  or courier services cut off because  of a labour dispute (both are supplied by independent firms), etc.  IN SUMMARY, THIS IS WHAT THE BANK  WAS SAYING:  Allowing one branch to unionize  would result in 'chaos'; it would  disrupt the economic fibre of the  country, and bring about the collapse of the entire Canadian banking  system.  Banks could never unionize because  it would be against the public interest.  According to the C.I.B.C., the only  appropriate unit is the national  one. A national unit effectively  discourages any attempt to unionize.  THIS IS SORWUCS POSITION:  Bankworkers have a basic right to  trade union representation and the  government has been trying to extend  this right to anyone who desires  it. This is evident in the legislation which allows a union to apply  for certification with only 35%  of the members signed up.  Although a large (even national)  unit may be the most effective one,  it is not feasible. Therefore,  the Canada Labour Relations Board  should grant certification to a  unit which, although not the best,  is at least functional and plausible.  SORWUC stressed the Board's obligation to define a unit if the branch  is deemed inappropriate.  Mr.Hicks, representing the C.I.B.C.,  denied that the Board was under  any such obligation and asked that  they merely decide on the appropriateness of the branch as a unit.  The decision about these applications  for certification by the United Bank  Workers will be made by the C.L.R.B.  sometime during May. Kinesis will  be reporting upon that decision in  the next issue.  PROVINCIAL DRIVE  The United Bank Workers is now  concentrating on spreading information about their union throughout  the length and breadth of B.C.  They NEED people all across the  province who are willing to help  leaflet their local banks.  Contact them right away. They will  direct you to a local bank, and send  you the leaflets, and tell you how  to go about distributing them.  Do it!  Contact: UNITED BANK WORKERS, #2 of  SORWUC, #1116, 207 West Hastings,  Vancouver B.C.  681 2811 or 684  2834.  The United Bank Workers conclude:  "Throughout, this hearing was a fascinating experience, and one not  soon to be forgotten. We can't  help but be optimistic, since the  only really terrible decision the  Board could make would be in choosing the national unit. Even if they  refuse the branch as a unit, and 8  Human Rights-  Men Only?  On May 9th, Yvon Beaulne, from UNESCO,  held a small, informal meeting with  women and men from the Vancouver  area about International Human Rights.  The International Human Rights Commission concerns itself with such  basic issues as quality education,  food and health care.  There was much discussion, from  a sexist perspective, of aboriginal rights: men's right to work,  men's right to aboriginal claims,  and so on. The irony is familiar:  discrimination was being discussed in a discriminatory manner,  with women's rights being excluded  all along the line.  When the feminist contingent raised  this issue, they were put down  with the usual sexist response:  'men are discriminated against,  too.' This from the UNESCO representative, Yvon Beaulne, no  less. One member of the group even  tried to*justify the sexist perspective by claiming that it was  'custom' for native Indian men to  exclude native Indian women in this  manner. (Racism and sexism, as  two forms of class oppression,  should be fought by allies, but  Affirmative Action  —Federally  The publication of the office of the  Co-ordinator of the Status of Women  within the Federal Goverment, Information , reports that through Labour  Canada and the Department of Manpower and Immigration, the government has initiated an affirmative action program for the companies with  which it has contracts to purchase  goods and services. The program is  designed to remove any artifical  barriers that block women's full  integration into all levels of the  labour force, says Information.  Guidelines to assist companies in  the implementation of affirmative  action programs have been prepared  through the two departments involved  in the program. Labour Canada will  provide consultants to the participating companies and Manpower and  Immigration will provide support  services, particularly in the area  of statistical analysis of labour  force data.  Copies of the guidelines are available from the Director, Rights in  Employment, Labour Canada, Ottawa,  Ontario, K1A 0J2.  C-24 Sexist  as well as Racist  Last month's Kinesis carrying some  comments upon the racist and discriminatory nature of the new immigration bill, C—24, now passed  its second reading in the House of  Commons.  Sorwuc has since pointed out in  greater detail the sexist as well  as racist nature of the bill. As  they say, it is a bill which discriminates against immigrant women. Where a deportation order  has been issued against a family  member upon whom others are dependent, the stated intent of clause  33 of Bill C-24 is to order the  deportation of women and children  where the husband has abandoned  them and where he is to be deported for 'wilfully'(?) failing to  support himself and his family.  No assistance will be offered to  women while they attempt to become  independent and once again women  are judged and found guilty through  the actions of their husbands. Do  not permit this to go unnoticed.  WRITE to Bud Cullen, Minister of  Manpower and Immigration, House  of Commons, Ottawa (no stamp) and  register your demand for the immediate withdrawal of this Bill.  Sisterhood moKes the newS  to scheme to divide and conquer  serves the status quo very nicely  thankyou).  One point of interest emerging  from this dreary session was that  two covenants have been passed internationally. One concerns civil and  political rights; another economic,  social and cultural rights.  Individuals or groups can take their  case to UNESCO when all other channels have failed.  There are no penalties they can impose, but they claim that public  opinion is a great pressure (e.g.  in the case of British torture of  the Irish).

Her arms were raised in surrender when she was shot; there is  no evidence that she had a gun,  much less that she shot it. The  main witness against her has admitted he had lied under oath and on  directions from a superior officer,  to a grand jury. The all-white  jury found her guilty of two counts  of murder and six counts of assault.  Immediately after the verdict was  read, Shakur was sentenced to  life imprisonment.  Assata came to prominence during  the early seventies as a leader in  the black movement. An advocate of  armed self-defense against police  repression, she quickly became  the target of an elaborate police  effort to put her behind bars.  From the time of her arrest in  1973, Assata was held without bail,  in solitary confinement, in the  basement of an all-male prison.  This was ruled "cruel and un -  natural punishment" and a federal judge ordered that she be removed. She never was. The Assata  Shakur Defense Committee (339 Lafayette, New  York, N.Y.) is working on fund-raising to support an  an appeal.  Defense lawyers feel that the atmosphere of racism pervading the proceedings made the jury's verdict a  foregone conclusion and that, as a  revolutionary black woman, Assata  could not have gotten a fair trial.  (Info from Seven Days and Women's  Press)  Lesbian Fired  OTTAWA (CP) - Pte.Barbara Thornborrow,  a 25 year old Ottawa woman, has been  threatened with dismissal from the  Canadian Armed Forces because she is  a lesbian.  Thornborrow, who works in the photography branch, gave reporters a written statement before sitting in on a  Commons committee on justice and legal  affairs where opposition MPs urged  the government to prohibit discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, such as homosexuality.  The MPs were starting clause-by-clause  debate on proposed Liberal human rights  legislation.  Stuart Leggatt (NDP - New Westminster)  and Gordon Fairweather (PC - Fundy  Royal) said they would introduce amendments to the bill later that would  outlaw discrimination against homosexuals or people with any other sexual  orientation.  Justice Minister Ron Basford said the  government has rejected the idea so  far because it wants to base the bill  on jurisprudence established by human  rights legislation in the provinces  and in the United States.  Basford also referred to problems it  would create because the human rights  law would supercede other laws that  allow discrimination against homosexuals for reasons of national security.(I)  (Sun, May 18 1977)  Write Justice Minister Ron Basford  immediately and demand that he include SEXUAL ORIENTATION in Bill  C-25. His address: Parliament  Buildings, Ottawa, (no stamp)  (also see page 3.) 9  In the US, the major organizing in the  women's movement is being channelled  into the fight for the passage of the  Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).  The ERA affirms that, "Equality of  rights under the law shall not be  denied or abridged by the U.S. or any  state on account of sex." If it is passed, there are thousands of sexist laws  on the books which will have to be changed; the Supreme Court would have to  reverse its recent decision allowing  discrimination against pregnant women;  and women, in particular working women,  would have another weapon in the struggle against insurance companies, banks  and major corporations for an end to  discrimination in hiring, wages and working conditions. In sum, if the ERA passed, the struggle against male supremacy  in all its forms would score a political  victory; sexism would be "unconstitutional".  Yet, as one ERA supporter explained, "We  understand that while the ERA is important, it will not end the struggle against male supremacy any more than the  passage of the 14th Amendment ended the  struggle against white supremacy."  The U.S. House of Representatives approved ERA 354-24 in 1971. The Senate  passed it with 8408 in March 1972. Within a year the amendment swept through 30  of the 38 state legislatures needed for  ratification. By March 1975, with four  years left to go before the 1979 deadline  Congress set for enactment, four more  states had ratified and only four more  were needed.  3 States to Go  But since 1975 only one state has ratified the ERA - Indiana. In April of  this year, Florida Senate voted against  ratifying the ERA, constituting a major  defeat for the movement.  Opponents of the ERA claim that the  ERA would undermine the family, force  women into the Armed Forces, and make  women "lose their right not to work because their husbands would not have to  support them." This last argument exposes  the nature of much ERA opposition -  it is concerned with those women who  do not now work outside the home.  The most vocal opposition - groups like  HOT DOG (Humanitarians Opposed to Degrading Our Girls), WWWW (Women Who  Want to be Women), HOW (Happiness of  Womanhood) - are front groups for the  John Birch Society and other right-  wing organizations. They claim the ERA  would require unisex toilets, the abolition of fraternities and the Boy  Scouts and the encouragement of abortion and homosexual marriages.  The Catholic Church, Right to Lifers &  fundamentalist preachers have also joined  the anti-ERA Campaign. Florida State  Senator Alan Trask, for example, quoted  the Bible during the debate, citing  The ERA  What It Is  WHO'S  FOR IT ;  (j AGAINST  and why  SOME FRENCH OFFICIALS HOPING FOR A  BABY BOOM  New York (LNS) - Some members of the  French government, linking French  grandeur to population size, (and  possibly to unspoken desires for a  large workforce) are considering policies which would encourage women to  have larger families.  These policies include increasing the  monthly aid and tax breaks given to  families for every child after the  first.  The French population has been declining over the past few years, in part  because of the widespread use of contraceptives and the availability of  legal abortions.  verses from Leviticus dealing witff "the  Lord's displeasure towards homosexuals."  "We must never pass a law contrary to  the teachings of God,M he said.  When ERA supporter Betty Friedan told  Sen.Dempsey Barron - one of the three  most powerful men in the Florida -Senate - that such groups as the League  of Women Voters would boycott Florida as  a convention site, Barron replied:"That  doesn't bother me. We got oceans, white  sands,  orange juice and Anita Bryant,  and that's enough for me."  Anti-Lesbian  Bryant, former Miss America and militant  opponent of democratic rights for homosexuals, lobbied heavily against the  ERA in Florida. She stressed that she  was upset "that so many ERA advocates  are lesbians."  tfhile the overt opposition claims the ERA  would create an "unnatural sexless society1  the covert opposition that worked behind  the scenes - featuring large insurance  companies - doesn't stoop to rhetoric.  W.Clement Stone, for example, the founder  head of Combined Insurance Company of America, gave $33,500 to the unsuccessful  1970 congressional campaign of Phyllis  Schafly, national leader of the anti-ERA  campaign. Stone was also Nixon's largest  contributor and an active contributor to  the anti-ERA campaign of Pro-America, a  reactionary women's organization.  A leader of the anti-ERA campaign in  Nebraska is State Senator Richard Proud,  a lawyer employed by Mutual of Omaha, The  insurance lobby defeated the ERA in Illinois and predicts success in its overall campaign to defeat the ERA nationally.  Insurance Lobby  Insurance companies militantly opposed .the  ERA because the industry thrives on sex  discrimination: women pay more for coverage and get less.  Companies refuse to pay disability insurance resulting from problems with  "organs peculiar to women." Women pay up  to 50% more for health premiums than  men, even for policies which do not cover  pregnancy, childbirth or abortion. Discrimination against women is built into  tables currently used to calculate life  insurance premiums and benefits.  In addition, the very rationale for buying life insurance - "to take care of  the wife and kids when the husband is  gone" - is challenged by the prospect  of women's equality and financial independence. In 1972, some 83% of all life  insurance policies were sold to married  men.  Finally, insurance companies are notorious for being among the largest employers of low-paid women workers - particular  ly in menial clerical jobs. The average  salary for women clerical workers is  $5551. For men, it's $8617.  ERA supporters are going to have to  re-think their strategy in the face of  this opposition. It is unlikely that  they can beat the insurance companies,  banks and organized right-wing groups  at their own game - lobbying. If the ERA  is to pass by 1979, the masses of Black,  third world and other working-class women will have to be mobilized.

The coup attempt was quickly crushed  by General Suharto, the leader of  the army. He claimed that the entire  Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and  the rest of the country's left-wing  movement were responsible for the  uprising.  Nearly half a million Indonesians  were killed in the massacres following the attempted coup. An even  larger number were arrested. Many  were imprisoned merely because of a  past membership or association with  left of centre organizations at a time  when such organizations were still  legal and sanctioned by former President Sukarno. Amnesty International  estimates that there are between 55,  000 and 100,000 prisoners who continue to be incarcerated without  being charged or tried.  GERWANI (Indonesian Women's Movement)  was the largest women's organization  in Indonesia with a membership of  more than one million. Due to its  left-wing sympathies, it was banned  for alledged complicity in the abortive coup attempt. GERWANI members  were also accused of being responsible  for atrocities committed during the  attempted coup. Many of the GERWANI  women were subjected to torture and  sexual abuse during their interrogation. Reliable accounts of torture  were contained in the Sunday Times,  London, January 11, 1976. A young  woman, Tjiou, was severly and sexually  tortured. She also observed a woman  who had boiling.water poured over  her head; a woman whose nipples had  been cut off, and a man who died because of electric shock treatment.  Some of the women in prison were  victims of circumstance: people picked up on the streets without i.d. &  unable to defend themselves against  political charges; women whose daughters and sons were being sought by  the army; women who were picked up  together with their husbands or sons  for no reason other than their relationship to them. Other women did have  their own political lives.  After eleven years, only a handful  have been brought to trial and the  charges against them have not been  related to the alleged atrocities  during the attempted coup. The best  estimate is that there are over  2,000 women still in prison with little  hope of release or trial.  (to p. 14)  NOW National  Conference  "We're the largest, strongest feminist organization in the world and we  know we shall overcome."  This was how Eleanor Smeal, the newly  elected president of the National Organization of Women (NOW) ended her  acceptance speech to the 10th national  NOW convention, in Detroit, April 21-  24.  NOW's 55,000 members were represented  by some 675 official delegates from  every state in the U.S. The purpose  of the convention was to elect, new  national officers and formulate strategy for the beginning of NOW's  "second decade".  At the previous convention in Philadelphia in October 1975, Karen De.  Crow was narrowly elected as a "majority caucus" leader who campaigned  under the slogan, "Out of the mainstream into the revolution." More  conservative opponents threatened to  form another organization which would  not speak about "work-site organizing,'  minority women or "recognizing the  bond between oppression based on  sex, race, sexual preference, poverty  or ethnic background."  By the 1977 convention, the "majority  caucus" had disbanded and DeCrow  dropped her references to 'revolution',  At press conferences and in her keynote address, she spoke about the  ERA, about the need for displaced  homemaker legislation, separation of  church and state and lesbian rights.  This year, Smeal won by a margin  of 526-66 : there was no real political contest for offices. There was  only a rare nod by NOW to the needs  of working-class, poor, Black or other  third world women. The constituency  they appealed to was the "suburban  housewife who wants to end her house  arrest."  NOW promoted the image of their  new president as a "typical housewife." All the new officers, as well  as the resolutions committee, gave  second place priority to the rights  of homemakers (behind ERA). No priority was given to welfare reform, the  expansion of social services, or  childcare.  A mild resolution calling upon NOW  to support concerns of minority women was defeated and its sponsors,  members of the Trotskyist SWP, redbaited, (info from the Guardian)  CHILE  Once again, the Committee for the  Defense of Human Rights in Chile  expresses its solidarity with political prisoners in Argentina.

It was  jointly sponsored by the Project on  Women and Mental Health at Washington School of Social Work, the Sexual  Assualt Centre at Harbor View Medical  and the Continuing Education School  of Social Work.  Susan Brownmiller, author of Against  Our Will and Lenore Walker were two  of the speakers. Brownmiller recapitulated some of the information contained in her book, which is basic  reading for all feminists.  In particular, Brownmiller stressed  that media reinforces violence against  women. Men identify with the aggressors; women have no choice but to  identify with the victims.  Violence is not culturally specifc:  suttee, foot-binding, infibulation  and purdah are all examples of violence against women, each practised  in a difference area of the world.  Each culture has myths to reinforce  the notion that these acts are  desirable.  Brownmiller suggests that there is  a correlation between sexual abuse  between pimps and prostitutes in  the following manner: pimps have  externalized their assault; prostitutes have internalized it.  This is a thought-provoking concept  and it would be interesting to  develop it further.  Media violence is simply a natural  extension of the violence we imbibe  as children, from fairy tales.  Little Red Riding Hood is a good  example of victim-training. Blue  Beard is another. These find their  adult expression in , for example,  Lena Wertmuller films and such  movies as Clockwork Orange.  Brownmiller elaborated upon this concept by discussing the glamourization  via cultism, of certain criminals  such as the Boston Strangler and  Charles Manson. None of the violence involving boys and men have  resulted in any comparable cults.  Comic books, confession magazines,  the rape of the heroine in Ayn Rand's  The Fountainhead, Mick Jagger's rock  lyrics all reinforce the victim syndrome .  Pornography, to Brownmiller, is  "undiluted violence" against women.  It suggests that women are simply  bodies to be degraded and humiliated by our society.  Pornography, she feels, is a symptom  of the male backlash against the  women's movement. Brownmiller summed  up by stating that this male fantasy  of violence is connected with a distorted concept of masculinity.  There were two other presentations  following Brownmiller's. One was  by an assistant prof in the social  work dept. at the University of  Washington, Jennifer James. She  indicated strong anger at Brown-  miller's ideas and suggested that  we should strike a balance and be  humanists first. (!)  Lenore Walker, another assistant prof,  presented some excellent information  about battered women. She defined  battery as "physical or psychological  abuse, usually repetitive, serious,  cynical and coercive.  It is used by  men against women, in order to get  women to do what men want." Walker  stressed that the pattern of abuse  was cyclical.  The   Cyclical  Pattern of Abuse  1. As women become assertive they  return to relationships that had  been formed on different patterns  and become battered women.  2. The best alternative is to  leave the situation (if you have  the $$$$ to do so)  3. If unchecked, battery ends in  death.  4..Battery is not constant, it is  not random, it is cyclical and  can be either physical or psychological.  5. The group with the largest  number of batterers is physicians,  (are they used to being omnipotent?)  6. The batterer often seems to have  two different personalities: the  charmer and the batterer.  7. Some statistics: 40% of the women  had told no' one before. 10% reported  to the police.  8. The women have usually become  isolated and have few friends.  9. These statements are common:. "I  love him"; "He'll kill me", "What  about the children?"  10. These are some myths about  battery:  a. masochism  b. growth in violent homes  c. a woman's issue  d. caused by alcohol  e. poorer families.  Battery is cross-class, and there is  no conclusive link between alcohol and  battery. Alcohol is "a good excuse".  11.  are:  The cycle has three phases, which  tension-building  explosive  calm, loving, contrite.  The first phase, tension-building,  can last a long time. It consists of  minor battering incidents, small, unresolved scenes. During this time, the  woman tries to calm the man down; she  learns techniques that work, accepts  his battery as legitimate and denies  her own anger. The man becomes increasingly abusive, intrusive.  The second phase, explosive, is indicated by no one having control.  His object is usually to "teach her  a lesson". Weapons are often used. The  woman usually assumes the guilt.  The third phase : calm, loving, contrite is self-explanatory: he woos  her, sends flowers and enlists  friends and family to call upon her  sympathies. Eventually he wears her  down (guilt from her). And so they  move on to the first stage again.  The Vancouver Rape Relief workers  were pleased with the fact that  feminists were present at this  conference, and that our voices were  being heard.  The problem with all conferences  of this nature is: what happens  next? Most likely what will happen  is that the conference organizers  will issue resolutions directed toward raising the consciousness of  fellow-professionals about the need  for counselling. Counselling is of  importance in the early stages of  marital violence. But it does not  do much good when the violence has  been going on for ten or twenty-five  years. What is really needed are  more TRANSITION HOUSES, where women  can escape from their immediate situation and work out ways to live outside it.  Del Martin's introduction to Wife Battering, a letter from a battered woman  is the kind of material to which we  must return after schematized and objective analyses, like the one above.  In that letter, a woman writes:  "I have had glasses thrown at me. I  have been kicked in the abdomen when  I was visibly pregnant. I have been  kicked off the bed and hit while  lying on the floor, again, while I  was pregnant. I have been whipped,  kicked and thrown, picked up again  and thrown down again. I have been'  punched and kicked in the head, chest,  fact and abdomen more times than I  can count." 12  13  * WHAT IS A TRANSITION HOUSE?  A Transition House is a place where  a woman can go if her husband is  beating her up, beating the kids  up, and generally making life intolerable. Transition Houses are  run by women who will not give  out the woman's name to her  husband. The women who work at the  transition house believe that it  is the woman herself who can make  the decision about what she wants  to do next. They do not thrust  counselling/therapy etc upon her.  For most of our lives, society has  been telling us that we have to  fit in with what the father/boss/  husbands wants. Transition houses  put the needs of the women who  use them first.  * HOW DO TRANSITION HOUSES DIFFER  FROM TRADITIONAL REFUGES?  In this respect they differ radically from traditional refuges.  For hundreds of years, there have  been convents, hospitals, asylums,  charitable institutions and poor  houses. These refuges functioned  to serve the needs of the status  quo, the church, the community,  the family unit and the state.  They served (and still serve) as  a safety valve for the social institutions with which women were  in conflict. The traditional refuge  upheld the tenet that when the interests of men, the family, or community were in conflict with women's  needs, then it was not the society,  but the women, who must change.  * WHEN DID TRANSITION HOUSES  START?  In the seventies, and as a direct  result of the women's movement,  transition houses have sprung up  in many parts of the world: Holland,  France, England, the U.S., Australia, and so on. Feminists recognize  that the battered woman seeking  shelter shares with all her sisters  the battering of sexism, of which  her physical wounds are the extreme,  but logical, expression.  * HOW LONG CAN I STAY?  Most houses limit stays to about  a month, because of the high demand. During that time, women and  their children are given a safe  refuge, given support, and provided information regarding the  options open to them. The staff  listen to what women have to say  in a non-judgemental way. They  don't lay guilt trips on you.  * CAN I TAKE MY KIDS?  Yes, you can take your kids. Transition Houses have more kids in  them than adults, and women with  children are given first consideration.  * WON'T MY HUSBAND FIND OUT?  No he won't. The staff at Transition Houses are aware of the  problem, and will NOT give out  any information.  Much of this info, is taken from  an excellent VRB pamphlet.  * WHAT EXACTLY DOES A TRANSITION  HOUSE DO?  * It allows you to escape from a  dangerous situation;  * It provides an accepting, supportive and safe atmosophere;  * It allows you to share your experiences with women who have been through  the same thing;  * It gives you details about your  legal rights, social assistance regulations, day care and so on;  * It refers to you a counsellor,  if you need and want help about  getting a job;  * It will refer you to a marriage  counsellor, if you want to see one;  * It will provide day care for your  children during your stay;  * It will encourage you to make your  own decisions, and to recognize that  you are NOT the guilty person.  * HOW DO TRANSITION HOUSES OPERATE?  Transition Houses operate collectively,  which means that the residents take  part in the house maintenance and  cooking. Regular residents meetings  are held to assign chores and air  complaints. Because work is shared  by residents and staff, each resident's load is light enough to  let her devote time and energy to  working out her problems.  In a Transition House, you live and  work with other women and children,  * WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE TRANSITION  HOUSES?  Transition Houses in B.C. are all  part of the human resources service  network. This means that staff are  accountable to the representatives''  of this branch of the provincial  government.  But day-to-day control of the  House itself belongs to the staff.  Most decisions are made by the  staff on duty; more complex matters  are referred to regular and frequent  staff meetings.  * ARE TRANSITION HOUSES REALLY  NECESSARY?  Del Martin, author of Battered Wives  says that the only statistic you need  to know about the community demand  for transition houses is that in  every community where one has been  set up, it has had to turn away as  many women as it could accept. In  every area, the demand exceeds the  supply by 100%  * WHY DO WOMEN NEED TRANSITION  HOUSES?  If the police find a stranger beating you up on the street, they will  arrest that stranger. If it's your  husband beating you up at home, they  won't. Because you are your husband's  property and private property is what  police protection is for. You have to  lay an assault charge. After which, if  you don't have a transition house to  go to, you have to return home.  That's why transition houses are vital.  & 5j£r*fct~  &f<ECJG W't-UMb  l| this iS your family  and society treats you likp this  * HOW CAN I CONTACT A TRANSITION  HOUSE IN B.C.?  Safety is an important feature of  a Transition House. For that reason, these houses do not publish  their addresses in public places.  But they can be reached through  your local social service agency.  Call the.Department of Human Resources  or your local women's group. The women's group, in particular, will be  able to give your information.  Here is a list of transition houses  in B.C., and of women's groups who  are in the process of setting up transition houses in their area. They will  be in a position to tell you what's  happening.

But they will all try to  help you, and if they don't have  space, they'll will try to arrange  assistance as soon as possible  through other agencies.  MAPL€ RIDG€  by Anne Wood  THE MAPLE RIDGE STATUS OF WOMEN organised and ran a Transition House in  1974-75 on a LIP grant. This home was  called CHEZ NOUS.  Needless to say, CHEZ NOUS was well  used both as a place for desperate  women to stay and think things  through in a quiet, supportive atmosphere,  CHEZ NOUS was accepted by the community. Our local newspaper was cooperative in letting the community  know about the aims and needs of the  home. The public response was demonstrated in donations of money, canned  goods, baby furniture and support letters when we needed them. The RCMP  stated publicly that CHEZ NOUS was  the one service they felt was vital  and complemented their work in the  area of domestic problems.  Yet despite all this, CHEZ NOUS closed  on May 31, 1976 and despite constant  efforts to receive funding since, we  have not been able to re-open. Quite  frankly, I feel we never will.  CONF€R€NC€  The B.C.Federation of Women (BCFW),  has a transition house sub-committee.  They are currently planning a provincial Transition House conference.  Their idea is to have a working  committee made up of Fraser Valley/  Vancouver women who are geographically able to participate in the  planning meetings.  If you are intested in taking part  in the conference, or sharing in  the conference planning, contact:  Georgina Marshall, Chairperson of  the Transition House (provisional)  Subcommittee of BCFW, Sue Moore,  Action Coorindator of BCFW, or  Tia Strachan of the North Shore  Women's Centre. For addresses and  phone numbers of all three, call  Sue Moore at VSW: 736 3746.  FEMINIST P€RSP€CTIV€  Feminists who organize transition  houses are emphatic that the women  who staff them should share a feminist perspective. Unless they do, the  service they provide can become just  another prop for the status quo, which  is sexist to the core.  The B.C.Federation of Women policy  states this position clearly:"...  we support strongly the involvement  of femininists in all planning and  delivery of Transition House services  with the aim of avoiding the hierarchical structure and power relationships all too evident in most of the  present social services system.  "It is our fundamental belief that  in this sexist society women must be  encouraged to become more self-reliant,  economically and emotionally. We as  women have been conditioned to blame  ourselves for problems in our lives  and our confidence and self-esteem are  often low. Women undergoing life crises  must receive support from other women  to begin to take control of their  lives...We see Transition Houses as  one way of women sharing their strength  their skills and their knowledge in  order that more of us may survive  individually and collectively begin  to regain power over our lives."  The perspective is not one of adjusting to society. It is one of changing  it. 14  THE UNPAIDWORK OF WAITRESSING  In B.C. women and men in the service  industry now have an opportunity to  organize effectively.  Several month's ago, the waitresses  at Bimini's pub on Fourth Avenue  began organizing and are in the  process of applying for certification.  The workers at the Church's Fried  Chicken outlets in Vancouver have  now organized with SORWUC. They have  obtained certification and are  negotiating their first contract.  This victory was won only after  several firings and harrassment  by management. The fired workers  were re-instated after the union  obtained certification and the  Labour Relations Board learned  that the firings had been in connection with union organizing.  This spring, Grace McCarthy, Minister  of Tourism, rises in the House to  lament that the local tourist trade  is in trouble. She urges service  workers to smile and act nice, lest  (horror of horrors) profits fail to  soar.  Meanwhile, back in Toronto, the Ontario Tourism Minister, the Hon.  Claude Bennett, is complaining that  the tourism industry in Ontario is  losing money because of the high  (sic) minimum wage in that province  ($2.65 an hour). Bennett, who earns  $40,500 a year as an MLA, believes  workers are making "huge sums from  tips", and that they should have to  accept a lower basic wage to compensate.  (Toronto Star, November 24,  1976.)  Those who would be most affected by  this attack are:  - most waitresses, including most  older women, who work in family restaurants.  - chambermaids, most of whom are  immigrant and older women.  - coat checkers, who often don't  make even the minimum wage, because  they have to 'rent' the concession  from the hotel or restaurant.  - busboys, bellhops, doormen, barmen,  etc.  THE UNPAID WORK OF THE WAITRESS.  As in all jobs, there is a mass of  hidden work, which never shows up in  the paycheck, but which provides the  boss with free labour.  Some of the  following are common practices in  the industry, not illegal, but highly  exploitative:  - Getting and keeping the job. Because of the nature of the work,  there is a certain amount of sexual  work expected from women. It is  common to have to parade one' s body  in front of the manager in order to  get the job.  - Preparation for work.  In an industry where appearance is paramount  especially for women, it is necessary to spend many hours every week  buying and keeping clothes tidy and  clean. There are usually standards  of hair care, make-up, etc. that  must be met according to each employer's specifications.  - Set-up time. Part of the work of  waitressing is usually setting up  and cleaning up a section of the restaurant.  Frequently, not enough time  is given for the amount of work necessary. The result is that shifts  start earlier and end later, but are  direct free labour to the employer.  Time spent in unpaid 'set-up' work  could be as much as 15 extra hours  per week.  - "Walk-outs". The waitress is usually held responsible for paying the  bills of customers who leave without  paying.  If she refuses to pay and  is fired, she has no recourse.  - Cashiering. Though waitresses are  hired to serve food and beverages,  it is increasingly expected that  they work as cashiers as well, saving the employer another wage.  - Kickbacks.  This is another common  practice.  It involves paying percentages of your tips to other staff  such as the maitre d', the hostess,  the busboy, the cook, the barman, etc.  It often amounts to 10-20% to each  one.  Clearly, this is a subsidy to  the employer, serving to keep those  workers' wages down. Management also  frequently demands a percentage as  a 'guarantee' to keep the job. These  insidious practices are extremely  widespread.  Because it is only illegal for the employer to deduct  from an employee's wages directly,  the employer can fiddle with the  tips any way s/he pleases.  - "Breaks". Often restaurants are  understaffed and therefore there is  no time for the breaks allowed by  law (half an hour for every 5 worked) . Waitresses frequently work  straight through a shift with no  rests.  - Serving minors and 'drunks'.  The  waitress is legally responsible a-  long with management for not serving  alcohol to minors or anyone who appears to be intoxicated.  On the  one hand, we must decide when a customer "appears to be intoxicated" or  is a minor, and refuse to serve  liquor.  On the other, the employer  is "urging" us to sell more - after  all, the name of the game is increasing sales (i.e. profits).  Women in the Service Industry  - Statistics are unavailable on the  number of workers who earn tips in  the industry.  - In the service industry in 1973,  60% of paid workers were women.  - Only 20.9% of these were unionized.  (Much of the information in this  article comes from a brief prepared by the Waitresses' Action  Committee, a Toronto group.)  INDONESIAN WOMEN  Take, for example, Sugiyah. She was  a 13 year old student when she was  detained in 1965. She has now spent  about half of her life in prison.  She was a volunteer member of a  group associated with the PKI youth  organization, Pemuda Rakyat. When  Sugiyah was first arrested, she was  kept isolated from older women who  could have given her sympathy and  support. She was completely inexperienced politically.  Suhasih Suwardi was arrested in  1969 when she and a friend were visiting the Army security authorities  and making enquiries about their  respective husbands who had been arrested some time previously. They were  asked to go somewhere with the authorities. They soon found themselves in  Bukit Duri Women's Prison. They have  been there ever since.  A number of women prisoners were pregnant when they were arrested and  gave birth in detention. Others were  arrested with small children who are  growing up in detention.  There are also serious consequences  for women whose husbands have been  imprisoned for alleged participation  in the coup. The loss of the primary  wage earner is a serious blow. In  addition, the detainees' wives face  suspicion and hostility shown in  many localities to women living without husbands.  The women prisoners themselves are  plagued, perhaps above all else, by  their uncertain future. They do not  enjoy the luxury of a fixed prison  term. The majority cannot be charged or brought to trial because of  insufficient evidence. They cannot  be released because they are "security risks." Therefore, they have  been and continue to be detained  indefinitely without trial. 15  1. What is. the lawyer's reputation? Were you referred to her/him  by someone you trust, by someone  who has had experience with this  lawyer's legal work?  2. Has the lawyer had experience  with the judges and courts of  your city or town? What kind of  legal problems does she/he handle  mostly?  3. What kind of attitudes does  the lawyer have? Does she/he  make stated or unstated assumptions that would prevent her/him  from working in your best interests? Does she/he assume that  mothers should always have primary responsibility for their  children; that a woman who put  her husband through school or a  job training program may be entitled to money from her husband  to put her through school or a  job training program after the  divorce (or even if there isn't  a divorce); that women in general (or you in particular) are  simple-minded and inferior? Does  the lawyer respect you as a  person? Can the lawyer imagine  herself/himself in your situation?  4. What is your lawyer's fee?  This question applies only to  lawyers in private practice. If  your income qualifies you for  legal assistance through Community Legal Services or Legal Aid,  you may pay court costs only;  lawyer's fees are free. If you do  not qualify but there is a substantial discrepancy between your  and your husband's separate income  and assets, you may be entitled to  party and party costs (1) of the  divorce awarded by the court against  your husband.  (Party and party costs: These are  the costs of the action as set out  in the Supreme Court Rules and represent the costs the Judge will  order the husband to pay. They are  less than solicitor-client fees.  A lawyer for a wife will be paid  the party and party costs as awarded by the Judge (usually about $400)  and he will bill the wife for  solicitor-client costs over and  above the $400. E.g. his fees and  disbursements may total $550, so  the wife would have to pay $150  and the husband $400.)  You may have the right to these  costs regardless of whether you  are divorcing your husband (if  you are the plaintiff) or he is  divorcing you (you are the defendant in a contested case.) However,  many lawyers are reluctant to take  your case at all if they are not  sure where the money is coming  from to pay them.  The prices private lawyers charge  for their work vary a lot from  person to person and firm to  firm. The average charge for an  uncomplicated and uncontested  divorce, including lawyer's fees  and disbursements is $550. (Disbursements are about $60 on a  divorce). Anything less is a  bargain (in the eyes of the lawyers)  and anything more is a rip-off.  Average fee for a separation agreement is $200. For a child custody  hearing, it is $350; and for a support  hearing, it is $250 for the plaintiff (person bringing the suit), and  $150 for the defendant (person responding to the charge. However,  some lawyers will perform these  services for less money. The  B.C. branch of the Canadian Bar  Association has a Lawyer Referral Service which will refer  people to lawyers in their area  who practice family law. Those lawyers who have agreed to be on the  referral list will see you for  the first half hour for a fee of  $5.00. If you are getting a divorce and you want to take your  prior name, be sure to state that  out the outset. Other than a minimal filing fee, there should be  is involved because one of you  decides to contest the divorce,  there is a fight over child custody, your husband disappears and  must be located, etc. The important thing to know is what is  happening for what, and how much  you will be charged.  One important point: find out  what your lawyer considers would  justify a higher fee.  5. Does your lawyer have good communication with you? Does she/he let  you know what's happening with your  case? Does your lawyer talk in language that you can understand or  does she/he string together long,  legal terms that mystify and confuse  you? Many professionals have a vested  JUDG€ YOUR LAVY€R  HOW TO PICK SM  TIPS FOR  CUSTODY, DIVORCE, CHANGE OF NAME  PROCEDURES  no separate charge for this service.  Over the phone or at your first appointment with the lawyer, get a  financial estimate of her/his work.  Do you expect your divorce to be  contested by your husband? Do you  want a separation agreement and  if so, do you expect much resistance  from your husband on the terms of  the agreement (on support money,  child custody, division of property?) Is there much or any property to divide? Do you want your lawyer to represent you at Family Court  in obtaining a support-order or in  determining child custody and/or  visitation rights? Lawyers will have  different fees for each of these  tasks, depending on how much work  is involved, how much money you have,  or your husband has, and how much  the lawyer is used to being paid.  We suggest that you and your lawyer  draw up and sign a written agreement  of what services the lawyer will  perform, how much time the work  should reasonably take, and what  the lawyer's approximate or maximum fee will be. You and your  lawyer can negotiate a new agreement if the conditions under which  the first agreement was made, change.  For example, if your own financial  situation changes or if more work  interest in using all the technical  terms they can so that their clients  cannot question them and so that  their work seems more complicated  and difficult (and therefore deserving of dollars) than it really is.  If you do not understand what your  lawyer is doing and why, ASK. AND  KEEP ASKING UNTIL YOU GET A SATISFACTORY ANSWER.  In any given situation, you probably have several options. You lawyer should let you know what they  are and discuss their possible consequences. However, you need to  determine what your own goals and  priorities are. It may be helpful  to bring a friend with you when  you see your lawyer. Remember that  most decisions don't have to be  made on the spot. If you need time  to think something over, take  it. It is your decision and you,  not the lawyer, will have to live  with it.  Few lawyers have all the above  qualities - good reputation, valuable experience, empathetic attitudes, reasonable fees, willingness to communicate. Depending  upon your situation and goals,  some qualities will be more important to you than others. We hope that  as we become asssertive consumers  of legal services, the law will seem  less mysterious, lawyers will become  people just like the rest of us, ^w  16  Our Hon. Members  by KAREN RICHARDSON  Provincially  There is no provincial report on the  debates in the B.C. legislature regarding the status of women this  month as the house will be and has  been closed for some time.  I would like to remind you that  the Social Credit government plans  to introduce the matrimonial property act soon. We don't have a copy  of it, as apparently it has not been  printed yet. But we understand that  it only proposes equality of property division on divorce and not  during marriage! You should be sending off your letters to MLA's now.  In addition, the estimates for the  Education Minister's Dept. are  coming up in the near future, when the  house re-opens. It is our understanding that the Minister has appointed  Diana Cruchley as curriculum development officer to look into sexism in  education. However, we have been unable to determine what her mandate  is. Ask your MLA to press Pat Mc  Geer (Education Minister) to commit  himself on Cruchley's terms of reference, to follow the recommendations  of the Women's Rally for Action.  VSW was in the process of composing a  brief on the new Change of Name act  when it suddenly passed without badly needed amendments. When we wrote  to the Hon. Bob McClelland, Minister  of Health (vital statistics), he  advised us that:  "I recognize that some people would  like to have seen the amendment go  further in the direction of liberalizing the change of names by married  women but consideration had to be  given to the probable effect of extending the use of different surnames  within a family.  "The new provisions included in Bill  3 were designed primarily to meet  those hardships which were most frequently encountered on the part of  married women in recent years.  "I am pleased to have your comments  on this matter and appreciate your  offer to provide us with the feminist  viewpoint on any such bills in the  future."  In the meantime, I would like to refer  you to two good articles on lobbying  methods. One is called Women. Helping  Women in the March 1977 issue of "Upstream", from 227 Laurier Ave, W. #207,  Ottawa, Ontario. It describes briefly  governmental procedures affecting legislation and what to do about them.  Another useful article is Phone Lobbying Prompts Immediate Response from  Calgary Women's Newspaper, 223-12 Ave  South West, Calgary, Alberta, March  1977 issue.  PRESS OFFICER LEAVES  Karen Richardson, Press Officer at  VSW, is leaving June 8 to live in  Toronto.  In this interview, Kinesis asks Karen  about her experiences at VSW and her  plans for the future.  KINESIS: Karen, ,you first came to VSW  to work with the Western Canadaian Women's Newsservice (WCWN). Could you say  something about the work of WCWN? What  were its goals? Did it achieve what it  set out to do?  KAREN: The Western Canadian Women's  Newsservice ran from May of '74 to  May of '76, and was operated out of  VSW, on grants from the Secretary of  State and Gene Errington's office when  she was the Provincial Coordinator for  the Status of Women in B.C. The purpose  of the service was to increase communications between women's groups in the  province, to improve the quality and  quantity of feminist newscoverage in  the media, and to raise the consciousness of politicians. The newsservice  consisted of a number of press releases  on current women's issues. Our concentration was on a hard news format.  KINESIS: Let's take the first goal, of  facilitating communications amongst the  B.C. women's groups. How would you  rate the success of WCWN in doing that?  KAREN: Many of the women's groups emphasised that it was a vital service. It was  of particular importance to the women  outside the lower mainland. "A lifeline"  was a phrase that was often used. One  problem with it was that the newservice  was meant to be a clearinghouse - sending news out to women's groups and receiving their news in return. It never  really worked like that - the flow of  news went out, but we didn't receive  any flow back in.  I think that this happened because the  women's groups were understaffed, providing crisis-oriented service of necessity, with no time left for developing  communications skills.  KINESIS: How about the second goal, that  of providing quality/quantity coverage  of the feminist news in the mainstream  media?  KAREN: At WCWN we employed a newsclip-  ping service, so that we had a very good  idea of which paper was picking up on  what. For the first year, the newspapers  by and large ignored us. But in the  second year (the fact that it was International Women's Year had something to  do with it), community newspapers began  to use our material. We had established  our credibility by that time. The Terrace  Herald, the Kamloops Daily Sentinel,  the Port Alberni Times, for example,  carried WCWN consistently, with full  credits, non-edited.  The Sun and The Province don't do this.  They use only the major newsservices.  So if you send them in a press release,  don't expect them to use it verbatim.  The purpose of a press release to them  is to inform them that something is  happened. They will then chose whether  or not to investigate it.  KINESIS: Did WCWN manage to raise the  consciousness of any of the politians?  KAREN: That's hard to guage. All the  MLAs in BC and the BC MPs received  copies. It's hard to tell what they  read. Their executive assistants draw  their attention to important items and  that's probably the best we can hope  for.  KINESIS: Why did WCWN fold?  KAREN: We had sufficient funding for  only 2 salaries, and we needed funds  for a staff of 4-5. We did not have  sufficient money for printing, and  everything had to be done on mimeo  stencils.  Then Gene Errington's office was  wiped out. If it hadn't been, we would  probably have had our skeleton funding  continued and we would have carried  on.  When we saw the end coming, we put  together the FEMINIST COMMUNICATIONS  KIT. In that, we tried to pass on  what we had learned about basic public relations: how to write a press  release; how to write a letter to  the editor,etc.  KINESIS: As VSW's press officer you  have continued your work in public  relations. What have you learned  doing that?  KAREN: I think I've come to a realization of the absolute importance  of each and every women's group in  u-  REMEMBER: KINESIS IS IN REAL NEED  OF MORE SUBSCRIBERS. PLEASE PASS  THIS COPY ALONG TO SOMEONE YOU  KNOW AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO SEND IN  A SUBSCRIPTION. DO IT WHILE WE ARE  STILL HERE.  We Must Lobby  the Media, Too"  the movement developing an awareness  of public relations. Every group  should be making regular press releases about their work. Press releases are a vital way of educating  the public. Much has been said about  the necessity of lobbying the MLAs  and MPs. Not enough has been said  about the need to pay attention to  the media. Publicity about the women's  movement creates pressure for change.  I feel very strongly that the women's  movement has sadly neglected the opportunity to reach people by dealing with  the regular media.  KINESIS: I think the biggest problem  is our conditioned response of intimidation.  KAREN: Until we can overcome that,  our movement will remain too silent.  The basic thing to remember when approaching the media is that you know  more about your material than the  media person does.  What Did You  Try to Do  as Press Officer?  KINESIS: As the press officer for VSW,  what are some of the specific things  you have tried to do?  KAREN: I have made press releases at  least a couple of times a month, and  I have written letters to the editor,  usually about one a week. 17  The Tyranny of Structurelessness  I see the press officer (and every  women's group should have one woman  who undertakes this responsibility)  as having a responsibility to conscientiously and diligently make statements  to the press on every possible occasion  about women's issues. It is very important to build up a network of contacts of editors and reporters who  have some consciousness about women's  issues. You have to establish credibility: provide reliable information,  get all the facts straight, not bother  with un-newsworthy items. I wish  that women's groups would take the  responsibility of responding to specific issues closest to their work.  Tlje myth exists within the media that  VSW is some kind of 'mother group' in  the movement. This is not true, and  the impression is not created wilfully  by VSW, but by the silence of other  women's groups.  KINESIS: You have also done a lot  of lobbying MLAs and MPs, especially  during our funding-time this year.  Do you have any particular points of  view about what works when lobbying?  KAREN: I think the first barrier is  again the intimidation we were talking  about earlier. The first time you  speak to your MP, it is scary. But  again, you do know more than s/he does.  Basford says he feels intimidated  when asked by women to respond to  questions about the movement, and  about women's issues legislation. He  has reason to - the women asking the  questions know way more than he does!  The importance of personal lobbying  is something we should really think  about and plan to do more of. Start  meeting with your MLA. MP when s/he  is in the riding. Do some C.R. in this  way.  Lobbying Inside  the House  Provincially  Tips for lobbying in person inside  the House. First  , go to Victoria  a day or two before the issue you want  to lobby about is going to come up.  The way you find out when it's going  to come up is to bug your own MLA.  When you go over to Victoria, meet  with the leaders of the opposition  parties in B.C.: Scott Wallace (PC),  Gordon Gibson (Liberal) and David  Barrett (NDP) plus any NDP/MLAs  who are interested. They have been  very useful to VSW in the past.  You'll need a pass to the public  galleries of the legislature in  order to hear the MLAs debate the  issue. You can get one from your  MLA or the opposition leaders.  When you are in the galleries and  you hear a member of the House say  something sexist,_ or against your  group, or something misleading  or erroneous about feminism or  women's issues, go downstairs to  the gates of the legislature.  There is a desk with writing paper  and pencils there that you can  use to write a note to the MLAs  with whom you have been liaising.  Write their name on each slip  and the attendant will deliver  it personally to that MLA in  the House while the debate is  going on.  By the time you get back upstairs  to the gallery, chances are the MLAs  will be standing up in the house  refuting the government's position  on women's issues with the facts  you have given them.  It is really exciting to be able  to influence the debates of the  legislature directly, in this "immediate way.  Your liaison with the MLA should not  just be at the time when you want her  or him to do something. Send them CR  material throughout the year, invite  her/him to your AGM etc, offer to give  them resource information.  Before lobbying in this personal way  in the House, be sure to alert the  Press. They might grab the relevant  Minister as s/he leaves the House  and your issue will reach the public  through media coverage.  The matrimonial property bill will  be coming up soon. Women's groups  could be present during the debate  to influence the direction it takes.  VSW and BCFW reps, will be in the  House during McGeer's estimates on  Education. We'll be there to force  McGeer to address the issue of  sexism in education.  LOBBY   LOBBY  KINESIS: What's your fix on letter-  lobbying?  KAREN: I think letter lobbying is another tactic that has some effect.  Write your MLAs, MPs. Keep a file of  what they say in return, and use it  for ammunition later. If they don't  answer you can always tell the press  they didn't.  Cabinet ministers get  a weekly run-down on the types of issues addressed in their correspondence,  although admittedly they don't read  each and every letter. Hellie Wilson,  Trudeau's assistant correspondence  secretary tells me that women don't  often write Trudeau on women's issues.  When they do it sticks out like a  sore thumb.  KINESIS: As well as serving 2 years  on the VSW executive, Karen, you have  also acted as resource-librarian. How  do you see that work fitting into  the work of a women's centre?  KAREN: The thing that strikes me about  women's centres is the high turn-over.  This makes it essential that a good  resource library is kept at all times.  The alternative is to keep on re-inventing the wheel. In a sense, the women's  movement does suffer from the tyranny  of structurelessness. Too mueh information is kept inside individual heads,  or floats around in desk drawers.  Re-Inventing  the Wheel  I believe that every women's group  should have at least-a rudimentary  resource file, and that it should be  available to the public. This is an  excellent CR raiser, too. I have sat  in the VSW office and watched women  and men high school and college students being bowled over by the information they have read here. It's  great to watch! And it's great to  get letters from people who have been  able to use the information I've sent  out, and I get requests from all over  Canada. Having a resource file to which  the local community has access is a  really important way of relating to the  community. We have about 30-40 people  a month coming in for this kind of  information now, and there are more  coming than ever before. Some men,  too.  How Did You Join  the Movement?  KAREN: Well I used to work as an  exec.sec.for a stockbrokers' assoc.  Then one day I went to a noon talk  at the Y. Gene Errington was speaking  After that I read everything about  feminism I could lay my hands on, and  I began to bug VSW to give me a job.  I bugged them till they did, with  WCWN...  KINESIS: Which is where we started.  The mainstream media's version of the  women's movement today is that it is  dead. What do you think of this?  KAREN: I feel a lack of energy and  direction in the movement right now,  but I'm confident it will return. I  have just finished updating the  Guide to the B.C.Women's Movement  and some groups have dropped away,  but others have sprung up. And I  know we'll keep going.  KINESIS: What are you going to do  next, when you go back east?  KAREN: I hope to get a job in the  women's movement, somehow. I have  learned so many skills from working in  the movement. Before I started at  VSW I knew nothing about dealing  with the media, nothing about lobbying, nor about politics. The growth  that comes from working here is  incredible and far, far outweighs  the lack of pay and long hours. I  don't regret a minute of it!  KINESIS: I gather that you have been  researching the possibility of  spending a summer in Toronto engaged  in some heavy boogie, and that you  have also been doing some personal  lobbying in that area. What are your  views on this?  KAREN: I think that it is an area  of great importance, and I intend to  reasearch it thoroughly! 18  THEWHITE HAIRED GIRL   Chinese Heroic Realism  During the first week of May, the  Shanghai Ballet was in town, making  its North American premiere. Their  major performance was the ballet,  THE WHITE-HAIRED GIRL.  What to make of it, from a western  feminist point of view? The prices  - $12.50 and $15.00 were scarcely  people's prices. And the genre -  that of heroic realism - is foreign  to most of us, who are used to  ballets which take heterosexual  love as their romantic theme, or  which, in a more contemporary manner,  explore states of mind with an open-  ended morality.  The Stotement  Seems Distant  THE WHITE-HAIRED GIRL is a  cultural  statement distant indeed from those  which our own society produces. By  looking more closely at THE WHITE-  HAIRED GIRL we can learn something  about the society which produced  it, whose means of material production and therefore social relations are radically different  from ours.  THE WHITE-HAIRED GIRL originated  as folk opera in 1945. In its  original outline it is the story of  a"crazed woman discovered by the  soldiers of the Liberation Army  during the Civil War, living alone,  "like a wild beast in a cave."  Once the beautiful daughter of a  peasant, she took the landlord's  fancy. On the pretext of collecting  the rent, the landlord drove the woman's father to suicide and raped  the woman. Later, upon finding the  woman to be pregnant, the landlord  decided to murder her. The woman  was helped to escape by a household  servant. She hid in a mountain cave,  and gave birth to her child. In  the years of deprivation and suffering she knew nothing about the changes  in China. Her hair turned white and  she hovered around the village  eating food left for her by superstitious townsfolk who believed her  to be a "white-haired goddess" until  she was discovered by the soldiers  who then heard her story.  Wk  V  The story line of THE WHITE-HAIRED  GIRL has undergone serious political  criticism and subsequent change since  the Cultural Revolution. In the  revised versions, the father does  not commit suicide, but fights back  against the landlord. The man who is  in love with her flees with hatred in  his heart to join the Eighth Route Army,  led by the Communist Party.  The woman, who is taken as a slave  to the landlord's house, is portrayed  as a strong person, who does not accept  her subjection, but who fights strongly  against it. Throughout, she is given  the support she needs by another woman,  also a servant.  When, after many years of living in  a cave, she is discovered by her friend  in the Eighth Army, she goes with the  rest of the village to punish the landlord.  Not only the story-line but the dance  technique itself expresses the political struggle that has swirled about  the arts in modern China. For example,  "the only instance in the ballet when  a partner actually handles a ballerina",  says Helen Atlas, an American dance  authority, is in the climactic scene  when the heroine is discovered by the  hero. "And that", adds Ms.Atlas, "was  done sparingly." The reason for this  lack of partnering was perhaps expressed earlier by another dance and drama  critic, Lois Wheeler Snow, when she  discussed the evolution of THE WHITE-  HAIRED GIRL with members of the Shanghai Ballet in the context of the Cultural Revolution which gripped China  in the late 1960's. They told, her,  "the revisionists wanted to give prominence to love as 'the eternal theme  of ballet.'...Stanislavsky says,'The  theme of struggle between male & female is eternal.' But New China would  not be able to establish itself on  the basis of male and female struggle."  And one of the major figures in  the Cultural Revolution was Chiang  Ching, now accused of purging  "every revolutionary artwork produced before the Cultural Revolution. " Given that the relationship between art and politics in  China is vital, it would not be  suprising if this political reality  has already found expression within  the ballet.  Ballet is a mass, popular at in China.  Typically, the Shanghai Ballet performs  two or three evenings a week at the  Worker's Cultural Palace in East Shanghai. Every Thursday or Saturday all the  dancers in the company visit either a  local commune or factory. For a period  of about one month a year, members of  the company work in factories, on the  farms or in the army. Even when visiting the communes to present performances,  all members are billeted with families  of the village. Back stage, all members  of the troupe, including the "stars"  help move scenery and clean up after,  putting the costumes and properties  away.  All members are paid about the same  as factory workers, and the "stars"  receive no special increments.  The dancers of the Shanghai ballet  believe their close connection with  people gives new depth and range to  their performances. As one dancer explained: "The heroes of the ballet are  peasants, just as the members of the  audience are. Many of the people in  'Ģ  the audience have had experiences similar to those of the characters in the  ballet. They, above all, have the  right to speak as critics.  After most performances, a discussion  is held between the audience and company (when the ballet is at home in  China, that is). According to these  discussions modifications can be made  in the story line. It is a story  that thousands of Chinese have lived,  and they know how they want it told.  ANOTHER VIEW OF THE NIGHTCLEANERS  Sandra Heindsmann's acrimonious review of the British feminist film,  NIGHTCLEANERS, shown in Vancouver  at the Pacific Cinematheque on February 16th, is a good example of  how not to write feminist film  criticism.  Rather than applying expectations  of straight narrative documentary  to NIGHTCLEANERS, Heindsmann would  do well to attempt a criticism  not derived from the dominant  traditions of practical criticism  based on personal, subjective  response typical of most newspaper  and magazine format, and look  instead at NIGHTCLEANERS as counter-  cinema .  Claire Johnston's explication of  NIGHTCLEANERS was reprinted from  SPARE RIB, a feminist magazine  published monthly in London,  England, by the editors of Cinema-  Brig Anderson  theque Pacifique Newsletter. It  deserved more attention than  Sandra Heindsmann gave it, for its  detailed analysis of how politics  and feminism exert an influence  on the work of art and on the  audience reading the filmic text  as a deliberate antithesis to commercial cinema. NIGHTCLEANERS attempts  to undermine bourgeois ideology by  showing the disparity in the lives  and views of the women cleaners and  their employers, the relationship  between labour and capital.  The 'freezing of individual faces'  of women did not make me ask, 'What  is she thinking?'; rather, I felt  the film-makers were counter-stereotyping woman as object by showing  woman as victim of unjust and unfair working conditions, in addition  turn to p. 21 19  SOME BOOKS FROM DIANA PRESS  A PLAIN BROWN RAPPER, by Rita Mae Brown.  Illus. Sue Sellars. Published by Diana  Press, Baltimore, Maryland, 1976. $5.00  Reviewed by Lilija Valis  Rita Mae Brown's book is a collection  of previously published essays dealing with diverse subjects such as  violence, love, mass media, language,  powe ,gossip, leadership, art, change,  heterosexual women, gay men, middle-  class women, poor women, feminists  and lesbians. The theme that links  all these topics is a lesbian-feminist consciousness. To Brown, lesbianism means total commitment to other  women. She feels lesbians represent  the greatest threat to male supremacy.  The stance of the book is polemical.  It contains numerous interesting  personal opinions and observations,  political analyses ( a particularly  good one is on the politics of  body movements to indicate servility and dominance), and recommendations for political action to institutionalize feminism. The writing is  earnest, picturesque, crude, sim—  plistic, funny in a heavy-handed  way, dogmatic and clogged with psychological, sociological and political  jargon.  The book is a fascinating microcosm  of American society: intense, idealistic, unjust, angry, chaotic and  fragmented.  Brown herself was an orphan, poor,  and early in her life attracted to  women. Needless to say, life was  harsh, full of rejections and conflicts. The book itself can be described as one of conflicts: lesbians  against heterosexual women; poor  women versus middle-class women;  black versus white women; and everybody against rich, white, heterosexual men.  The book is filled with contradictions. Brown appears to have no tolerance for difference, although she  stresses its desirability. She dislikes, perhaps even hates, middle-  'class women and is continually belittling them, yet she expresses a  desire for nice clothes, decent  shelter and good food, which are considered middle-class things. If the  middle-class women reject a materialistic life, they are still unacceptable because they are seen as insulting the poor who are trying to improve  their material situation. Brown rejects the male concept of love as  sex, yet she believes only lesbians  can truly love other women. She has  contempt for intellectuals, but  lets us know she is a Ph.D. herself  and accuses women of not pushing  themselves hard enough intellectually.  She obviously identifies with the  poor but her identification is complicated. In New York in 1965, when  she was hungry and poor, she stumbled  one day on to a "well-fed" Candice  Bergen during the filming of "The  Group". She felt painfully the tremendous gap between them. Then her  pain turned to rage. "Goddammit it,  I'm as good as you are. I'm not  just a poor asswipe in clothes. I'm  an artist! I'm an important person!" Implying, of course, that the  other poor people were not.  In the  U.S., particularly, you're worthless if you're poor. Even the poor  believe that.  Like many people who were made to  feel worthless once, Brown tends to  overstress her importance. She makes  herself the star of the book, reporting her speeches to other, less enlightened women, and recording  their 'stunned' reaction.  The book overall is interesting and  provocative. It is an attempt by  one woman to escape the prejudices  of her society and to build a more  just one, and presents, deliberately and inadvertently, many of the  issues we must deal with in order  to build successfully that society  of love and cooperation.  THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, written by Rita Mae Brown and illustrated  by Ginger Legato.  Published by Diana Press, Baltimore,  Maryland, 1974. $3.00  Reviewed by Lilija Valis  Rita Mae Brown's poems are a testament of love to women and a rejection of the destruction she feels is  inherent in male culture. The  sea appears in various poems to symbolize life and female immortality  and the city to represent male values and death.  In her themes of male destruction,  the oppression of women, their love  for each other, the search for a  proud past and the desire- for a just  future, she is attempting to forge  a new poetic consciousness and  deserves credit on that account,  although I found her style generally too heavy and polemic and her  view of love too narrow and traditionally male (romantic and sexual).  Still, her feelings are intense and  genuine, and she has some fine  lines, such as "...her name is  sewn Along the edges of my dreams"  and "...we are cementing our lives  As a coral reef is built Blossoming into iridescence providing  homes for wandering Angel fish  And other bits of beauty."  The black-and-white illustrations,  though somewhat bleak and forlorn, stir the imagination and  reflect some of the feelings in  the poems.  SELENE: THE MOST FAMOUS BULL-LEAPER  ON EARTH. By Z.Budapest, illustrated  by Carol Clement and edited by Helen  Beardwoman.  Diana Press, Baltimore, Maryland.  Reviewed by Lynn Kirk  Good non-sexist book for children,  based on research into matriarchal  societies where women were socialized  to be strong and brave. Imaginative,  well-illustrated.  Good book for  girl children to develop strong  self-images, a sense of adventure  and a glimpse of past cultures  in which sport was less aggressive/  destructive. Sport helped one develop  strength and grace.  The image of bull-leaping has significance for feminists, too.  In bull leaping, the male principle  (the bull) is controlled by the  female principle (the leaper). This  is in opposition to the idea of  bull-fighting: the bull is killed  in the end by the man, as a "defeated male scab who loved the Goddess." 20  Lf_^^  The following materials are available from the Canada Council on  Social Development, 55 Parkdale Ave,  Box 3505, Station C, Ottawa, Ont.

(Spare Rib, April 1976, o.l7)  NIGHTCLEANERS is a complex and moving experience which I cannot possibly do justice to in the space  allotted here; but I want to concentrate on the 'freezing of individual  faces' as a structural element in  the film which also has been given  the value of a sign, a symbol of  the oppressive routinization, isolation and loneliness of the nightcleaners who are shown not- as  cleaned-up 'stars' but as suffering,  aging, tired-out and exhausted  women who go home at 7am every  day to look after their homes and  children during the day, and get  as little as three or four hours'  sleep. The technique of separating  visuals from sound is not unique  to this film, as Heindsmann states,  but underlies the mode of producing  any film: any textbook on filmmaking stresses this process.  Far from being sentimental in  the 'cute native' National Geographic tradition, the film addresses  itself to questioning the economic  basis of our society of which the  nuclear family forms an integral  part. All the women interviewed  are cleaners and mothers: the work  they do in offices is repeated again  during the day, on an unpaid and  voluntary bais. NIGHTCLEANERS is  A Critique of  Patriarchal Culture  a critique of patriarchal culture  that takes this kind of exploitation for granted. Its feminism  lies in the patient way the filmmakers have assimilated their  material, have created or sub-  structed it for a devastating  attack on a dehumanizing capitalist system. Ardele Lister's SO  WHERE'S MY PRINCE ALREADY? gives  the humourous, satirical version  of such an attack.  The voice-over by a middle-class  'movement* woman provides the  theory feminists have constructed  to analyze their own condition,  how their sexuality is embedded  in the family as the basic unit  or mode of production. To disengage ourselves as feminists  from a patriarchal ideology is  important, the film-makers tell  us, and the act of filming and  the act of reading the film are  equally important, neither having  priority over the other. We are no  longer passive consumers being  entertained, but the film becomes  a material object whose meaning  is produced by the spectator in  the moment of watching and reading  the 'text'.  It is time that we created a solid  feminist film theory so that future  film-makers do not feel they are  working in a vacuum, and that their  work has reference to actually working lives of women in ordinary life.  One way to subvert narrative illusionist cinema which is the staple  fare in movie houses and on the  T.V.screen is doing what the Berwick  Collective, who made the film, did.  They actually waited for the nightcleaners outside the Shell Building  when they finished their shift, and  in the course of a long and difficult  two years radicalized themselves and  the workers to political action.  NIGHTCLEANERS is an account of this  process. It is also a work of art;  its off-screen activity is not  clearly articulated, made ambiguous  to force the spectator to become an  active participant in understanding  that the act of viewing a film is  work which involves imaginary activity.  NIGHTCLEANERS is available through  the National Film Board (90 mins.  b/w, 16mm, rental 18 pounds (English  currency) ). I hope you will reorder it, as it represents an important event in the Women's Movement  where subjective response to exploitation becomes a personal 'speaking  plain' and a feminist search for  identity validated by our politics  of collective action.  feopteS  Hl#VM*jF«»» (continued from page 7)  don't define what the appropriate  one is, we will still launch a  campaign for the province. If we  do have to do this, it seems inconceivable that the Board could turn  down such an application. If they  choose a region or even the province, we are confident that we  would succeed. (This would have  the advantage of anonymity - no  one branch would be singled out as  a 'union branch'). As SORWUC's  national president, Jean Rands,  has said, 'Some members do feel a  provincial unit would be stronger,  but the point is that this is just  the beginning, this is when the  bank employees are going to believe  it and when thousands are going to  join. Whatever the Board decides,  bank employees are going to unionize.  The success we have had so far  shows that.'  Whatever the final decision, we are  making history!"

We are looking for  the laywoman's point of view  of whether the book is feminist or  not. We don't want super academic  reviews and the shorter they are,  the better!

The eviction came just after a women-only  social and the beginning of a  lesbian drop-in...  Richmond Grant  The Richmond Women's Resource Centre has been successful in obtaining grants for student and youth  employment this summer.

BCFW  DayOnFeminism  The B.C.Federation of Women is sponsoring a DAY ON FEMINISM, June 11,  1977, Sunrise East Learning Centre,  2543 Renfrew, Vancouver B.C.  The idea for the day grew out of the  Politics and Practice day - held on  January 29 at the New School. It was  clear in that meeting that feminism  meant many different things and that  a follow-up meeting was needed to  clarify feminist theory.  Basically what we want is a definition of feminism. 1. What are the  common assumptions about feminism  in your group? 2. What values do  you consider inherent in feminism??  3. Do you consider feminism to  be linked to other political ideologies. For the Day on Feminism,  two papers will be presented in  the morning, and the afternoon  will be given over to workshops  around particular issues. If copies  of the papers are available as resource for discussion, participation will be easier.

This is a three-day workshop.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, June  10, 11 and 12. Friday June 10 -  7.30 - 10.00pm; Saturday June  11 - 10.00 am to 5.00pm; and  June 12 - 10.00 am to 1.00pm.  Moira Mulholland's theatre background includes training as an  actor in London, England, work  in professional repertory companies,  training in classical No theatre  in Japan, and teaching at U.B.C's  Theatre Department. During the past  four years, she has been developing  ideas about myth, ritual and theatre  and their function in society.  The object of this workshop is to  explore female images in the theatre.  How do we as women feel about ourselves, and how do we see these  feelings reflected in the theatre?  Do we identify with the images presented to us? What does it mean if  we do? If we don't? This workshop will  be experimental in essence. There will  be space for everyone to contribute  and express herself. It is a workshop  for any woman interested in the theatre  as worker or audience. The fee for  the three days is $10.00  BranchingOut  BRANCHING OUT, an Alberta-based feminist journal, has received funds  from the Alberta Law Foundation to  support the law column which appears regularly in the magazine.  The Law Foundation funds will be  allocated to contributors who are  researching and writing on issues  of vital concern to Canadian women. Articles which provide information on existing laws and suggestions for law reforms can be paid  for, and payment can be as high  as $500 bucks. For more information,  contact Linda Duncan, Law Editor,  Branching Out, Box 4098, Edmonton.  BCFW  Lesbianism/  Feminism  B.C.F.W. sponsored a lesbianism/feminism workshop for Vancouver area  women on May 3. This workshop, offered by the Rights of Lesbians subcommittee, has already been held in Prince  George, Campbell River and Nelson.  It was the first time that the workshop was offered to lower mainland  women.  The workshop attracted a small group.  This turned out to be a positive factor, since the talking had the quality, to me, of a consciousness-  raising group which has been together  over a year and a half. Some of the  women who attended have worked alongside one another for months or years,  yet still had a sense of not knowing  one another in a personal and open way.  It was an occasion for airing half-  formed thoughts, previously unspoken  fears and it was a time for some  laughter. A sympathetic space.  Another lesbianism/feminism workshop  will be held in June, again at the  Full Circle Coffeehouse, 152 East  8th Ave, at 7.30 pm. Any woman is  welcome.  Call Val Embree at 228 8143 or  732 3123 for more information  about B.C.F.W. events.  BCFW&Film  At the last regional meeting of reps,  to B.C.F.W. from lower mainland women's  groups, a small committee was struck  to organize a women's film event at  the Pacific Cinematheque. This committee is mulling over ideas. What do  you want - a festival? a series? old  films? new films? politics? art?  foreign? Anywoman with ideas is encouraged to get involved! Actually  you don't even need ideas - enthusiasm will do. Contact Nicola at  WOMEN IN FOCUS, 872 2250.  Meet theMedia  Is anyone interested in a women's movement/Media Introductions Party? How  many of you have yearned to know the  personality behind the newswriter?  the interviewer? Is access to media  'all contacts'? If so, let's make  an occasion to create some! No longer  will we stand on formality, waiting  to be introduced. Maybe we could make  it quite an occasion.

Every eligible voting member will be  receiving this information SOON!  VSW exec, meets  The following is a summary of the  business transacted at the last  meeting of the executive of VSW.  Lee Grills and Arlene Gropper,  executive members who represented  VSW at the National Action Committee Conference in Ottawa, reported  on the conference. The representatives felt that the conference  has been somewhat successful in  raising the consciousness of the  federal politicians, as one whole  day had been devoted to visiting  MPs in their offices. Women's issues were debated in the House of  Commons on that day. Press coverage of NAC was fairly good in  the east, and rather incidental  in B.C. Grills and Gropper recommended that VSW remain a part  of the National Action Committee  (NAC), pointing out that it is  the only national organization of  women, and that as such, VSW must  retain its voice there.  Karen Richardson, staff member of  VSW, reported on her recent visit  to Ottawa, to consult with the  members of the Secretary of State's  department concerning women and  the media.  This was followed by a report from  the Nominating Committee, struck  for elections at the VSW AGM,  coming up June 21st. The Committee  has prepared a series of questions  for each candidate. Those eligible  to vote will be sent mimeographed  copies of the candidates' responses.  Education Officer Nadine Allen suggested that a lobby group from VSW go to  Victoria while Education Minister  Pat McGeer is presenting his budget.  The aim of the lobby team's visit  would be to raise the issue of  sexism in education.  Various staff persons present at  the meeting made reports. Karen  Richardson, outgoing press officer,  outlined ways in which her sundry  duties could be allocated amongst  staff people and new executive  members (77-78)  In particular,  executive members will be responsible  for monitoring the Hansard of the  provincial and federal houses.  Carol Pfeiffer reported upon the  status of the ombudservice, and  Sue Moore made a detailed analysis of VSW's financial condition.  A hiring committee was struck for  replacing the ombuds/researcher.  Any member wishing to avail themselves of more details about this,  and other executive meetings, can  come into the office and read the  reports. Staff minutes are also  available for perusal, and are  taken weekly.  Vernon job  WHICH   ONE   OF   YOU  SUGGESTED  LAY/NG    OFF MANAGEMENT.'  Vernon Women's Centre Transition  House Worker.

The commitment made by its collective, in terms of time, energy and  talent, is incalculable.  The Canadian women's movement will  be the poorer without THE OTHER  WOMAN.  Right now THE OTHER WOMAN has less  than $100 in the bank, and a printing bill for $411.  They are keeping their subscribers'  list on file, should THE OTHER WOMAN  be resurrected in the future in one  form or another. And they have a few  OTHER WOMAN T shirts still for sale,  with their famous emblem of an old  woman.  THE OTHER WOMAN has helped push the  struggle along. It has not been in  vain.
