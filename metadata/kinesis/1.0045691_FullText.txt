 March 1986 Kinrth March iffifi  Was REAL Women  asked to run Vancouver  Transition House?  by Esther Shannon  The Ministry of Human Resour-  ses has some explaining to  do.  Peggy Stacy, president of the  B.C. chapter of Realwomen told  her organization's February  annual meeting in Toronto  that B.C.'s Realwomen women  were "askad to take over the  running of the Vancouver  Transition House." (see full  conference coverage, page 5).  In a subsequent interview with  Kinesis,  Stacy said her  remarks were open to mis-interpretation and what she intended to convey was that Real-  women received a letter from  the B.C. government informing  them of what was required  should they want to bid on  the Transition House tender.  Agatha Ratzlaff, a director  of the B.C. Realwomen said  "We were given the opportunity to take on the service  but as we were a new organisation and didn't have funding we weren't prepared to  take it on."  But the question remains  who in the ministry of human  resources solicited a Real-  women bid?  According to Elaine Murray,  the MHR regional manager who  was responsible for co-ordinating the tender process, no  letters soliciting bids were  sent from her office.  Murray, who said she has  never heard of Realwomen said  "I knew of most of the groups  who were submitting or even  thinking of submitting a  tender because I was organ- •  izaing that and usually I  got at least a phone call if  people were considering  applying."  According to Murray if groups  were being solicited it  wouldn't have been by ministry  bureaucrats.   * >.iJv:>  "I believe, Murray said, that  several groups were sent  letters about the tender by  Mrs. McCarthy but I wouldn't  know what groups they were."  Joan Abrams, MHR information  officer in Victoria told  Kinesis  she didn't have any  knowledge of letters going to  groups regarding the tender,  and thought the Ministry had  only relied on newspaper advertisements .  "If they (Realwomen) have a  letter then it must say who it  came from and that's pretty  clear," she said.  Peggy Stacy told Kinesis  that  the organization did have the  letter but it wasn't accessible  at that moment.  "We have it somewhere in our  files, said Stacy, but I don't  have the files available now."  As Grace McCarthy was not in  Victoria at press time, an  assistant in her office, Anita  Clark, told Kinesis  that the  only person who could confirm  that Realwomen were solicited  to apply would be the Assistant  Deputy "Minister of Human Resources, John Noble. Unfortunately  Kinesis'  repeated calls to  Noble's office were not re-  Megan Ellis, spokesperson for  the group which had occupied  Vancouver Transition House  said she was unaware of any  groups being solicited by  MHR,  "If what Realwomen is saying  is true, and I have no reason  to doubt it, Ellis said, "then  it's further evidence that  the government was more interested in finding a contractor  to run the house whose values  were in line with their values.  It's obvious if they are sending letters to groups that  have never provided services  for battered women then they  weren't interested in finding a group with experience.  There are a number of such  groups in Vancouver and as  far as I know none of them  received a letter."  This entire incident raises  a number of questions. Was  Realwomen solicited to bid on  the Transition House tender,  and if so, why is it that an  organisation which holds that  women whould remain in the  family be solicited to run  services for battered women?  Ban the  Copper 7  The Vancouver Women's Health  Collective wants the Copper 7  intrauterine device (IUD)  banned from the Canadian market. According to the health  collective, women who wear the  Copper 7 face considerable  health risks including pelvic inflammatory disease  (PID), excessive cramping and  bleeding, ectopic pregnancy  that occurs in the fallopian  tubes) and Wilsons disease, a  copper metablic disorder.  The Copper 7's American manufacturer, G.D. Seale and  Company, withdrew the IUD  from the U.S.' market where  over one million women wear  it.  Seale's withdrawal, says the  health collective, calls  into question the safety  and effectiveness of Copper 7.  "Seale's decision to halt  sales in the U.S. while con-  Copper 7 continued page 8  "Amazing Grace" (artist Jeannie Kamins) accepted the anti-poverty coalition's challenge to  live on welfare on behalf of the Sacred Party, after watching MLA Emery Barnes getting all  the publicity for the NDP. She lived for two weeks in the front window of the Pitt International  Gallery, where she invited visitors to come for tea (bring your own cup and tea bag). She  was also seen hobnobbing with Jimmy Pattison at a recent meeting in the Downtown  Eastside to stop residents being evicted in preparation for Expo, and to prevent an Expo  parking lot from being erected next to CRAB beach.  Prostitution law  Challenged under Charter  A Vancouver prostitute who was  arrested for soliciting in  January was in provincial  court last month challenging  the validity of the new anti-  soliciting act.  Michelle Lee McLean, represented by lawyer Tony Serka, is  seeking to have the law struck  down on the basis that it violates the Charter of Rights.  Serka won a landmark decision  in another soliciting case in  1978 which redefined soliciting arid in that ruling said that  soliciting must be pressing  and persistent before it was  an offense. Serka is arguing  that the wording of Canada's  new anti-soliciting law is  so vague and general it would  give police the power to make  arrests in hotels, bars or  even private homes.  Arguing before Judge Kieth  Libby, Serka said the federal  law, proclaimed on December  20th, is vague and uncertain,  unduly limits freedom, reads  differently in French and  English and deals with the  movement of traffic, a provincial matter.  Judge Libby has reserved his  decision until March 17'.  According to Marie Arrington  the new law is already being  used to arrest women in bars  and hotels.  "The police aim," Arrington  said, "is to control women.  Whenever they feel they're  needed they go. Looking at  the statistics across the  country, it's clear that  hookers are being arrested  twice as much as tricks."  "Women are now being arrested  for the second and third time.  When you've been arrested for  the third time the police will  hold you for days, often until your case comes to trial."  Arrington also says the new  law has made prostitution  more dangerous. "When women  have only a split second to  decide whether a potential  trick is a copy, a good  trick or a dangerous trick  there is bound to be mistakes. It's only a matter of  time before one of those  mistakes is fatal. Already  hookers are dealing with  escalating numbers of 'weird  tricks,' men who know the  women are vulnerable."  "Absolutely everything we said  would happen as a result of this  law is happening," said Arringto: .  • The only thing that hasn't happened yet is a dead body and we  are waiting for that."  The Alliance for the Safety of  Prostitutes has set up a  Hookers Defense Fund to pay for  court related costs for prostitutes, particularly in the  appeal process.

Typesetting and camera work by  Canadian groups  plan anti-apartheid actions  In honour of Sharpeville Day, March 21,  many local and national groups and supporters of the struggle against apartheid have  planned activities for March.  (On March 21, 1960, 69 South Africans were  killed by police during a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville against apartheid)  Nationally the South Africa Congress of  Trade Unions (SACTU) support committees  have called for a Week of Action from  March 8th to 15th.  Trade unions are urged to show solidarity  with SACTU with a series of workplace actions. Postal, telecommunications, airline  and maritime workers are being asked to  prevent mail, telecommunications, airline  services and shipping traffic between  South Africa and Canada.  On a community level members of the public  are asked to participate in a 'shop in.'  by demanding that retail store owners and  operators stop selling South African  products.  Canadians are also asked to forward telegrams to the federal government demanding  that sanctions be imposed against South  Africa.  At the recent Commonwealth conference the  Canadian government agreed with other Commonwealth countries to give South Africa  six months to take significant measure to  dismantle apartheid or face sanction-  action.  SACTU supporters are also urging Canadians  to picket and demonstrate at private and  public institutions which have links with  the apartheid regime (eg, Canadian banks  and universities , such as the University  of British Columbia.)

A delegation of women from  the Granville House restaurant  approached management. Which  was holding interviews for  staffing of the three new  restaurants which will be  operational in another 3 to  4 months. "If you've got real  jobs, then we want real jobs"  the women challenged.  Management barred journalists  and union employees from entering the interviewing rooms,  but spoke to the women who  had lost their jobs. Management promised" that they  "would try to find places  for them", possibly in the  new non-union White Spot.  The unionized Oakridge resta-  rant was closed for extensive  renovations in 1984. When  it reopened in 1985, management declared it was nonunion. While some of the  younger employees were hired  back as non-union workers,  those who were in their  mid-thirties and older were  not.  "An older person who's worked  for White Spot for some time  will stand up for their rights,  said union rep Frank Gilbert.  A young person is more easily  pushed around." He noted that  White Spot's ageist policies  affect women the hardest; 95%  of employees over 40 are  women.  The other alternative for the  Granville House workers; that  they will lose all their  seniority and be fitted into  existing unionized White Spots  as new employees, is equally  poor. They don't want to "steal"  hours from their union sisters  but management only creates  hours for new employees by  subtracting them from other  workers' shifts. At presstime,  only 10 Of the 70 employees  have been rehired.  Food and Service Workers of  Canada (FASWOC) members who  were passing out leaflets  on Broadway told the same  story. Employees say White  Spot is copying the fast  food business practices of  creating the cheapest labour  force possible by giving people  only part time hours and by  constantly hiring on new  trainees who work for less.  Managers are encouraged to use  part-timers and trainees  because the company makes  benefit contributions for  them. White Spot has even  built inequality into the pay  system to guarantee ways to  reduce labour costs and undermine union solidarity. In  managements imposed new contract, new employees will earn  up to a dollar an hour less for  the same jobs done by senior employees. Older employees are  also resentful that management  trains new workers at their  expense. "The manager says,  one woman reported, they're  hiring new employees and they  have to be trained, so we have  to give them some of our hours.  They say it'll pick up for .us  during Expo—but that's just  another promise."  FASWOC members point out that  managers tend to schedule  skeleton shifts, and then ask  the cheaper staff to stay if it  gets busy.  Workers get a 15 minute break  in a five hour shift; they can  White Spot employees handing out leaflets... the managers know who they are.  be asked to stay for an extra  90 minutes without another one.  Employees are so desperate for  hours that they usually stay;  others can't adjust their lives  so easily to the employer's whim.  Lori, who has 11 years experience  has found out that this can  jeopardize her job: "Management  takes it as a serious insult if  you can't stay. Subsequently,  they'll cut your hours back  even more, and when you go to  ask for more hours, they say,  'when we ask you to stay, you  don't, so obviously you don't  need them.'  White Spot now has the policy  of no set shifts, which means  an employee will not get the  same two days off each week,  nor the same shift. Women  often work six days without a  holiday because their days  off keep changing. It is impossible for them to plan to  attend an. event next month,  or even next week until the  new shift schedule is posted.  The new contract also contains  a clause that will allow  management to cancel, shorten  or phange someones shift,  provided they reach her before  she leaves for work.  A White Spot worker says  ' management is asking her to  sign a paper indicating what  she's going to do if a strike  is called. "The new employees  are scared. Of course they're  going to say that they'll stay  I even feel like doing it myself, sometimes, I get so  scared. I like my job, I'm  glad to have it..."  Her voice trails off, but  she reaches in her purse for  a handful of FASWOC leaflets.  She excuses herself so she  can join her friends beside  the FASWOC banner. Judy has  already made her decision.  The managers, who are waiting  for applicants, know who she  UBC  Into the sunset with Lady Godiva  The University of British  Columbia engineers have ended  their annual parade of a  naked woman on a horse, formerly known as the Godiva ride.  After years of protest, which  never managed to stop the  ride, this year was finally  different. The Coalition  Against Sexism on Campus  (CASC) began organizing in  the autumn to work out  strategies for permanently  stopping the February ride.  They gathered over 2000 signatures of support and received dozens of letters from  individuals, as well as political and professional associations. They brought the  issue to community and media  attention and pressured all  administrative channels.  In the original Godiva myth,  the townspeople so honoured  Godiva's protest against  unfair taxation that they  did not watch her. Only the  legendary peeping Tom observed  and, legend has it, he was  struck blind or dead for his  action. CASC felt that "The  Peeping Tom Parade" was a  more appropriate name for the  event staged at UBC.  As a result of CASC's efforts  the ride was altered in a way  that suggests its end. Un«  fortunately, it was preceded  by a strip show in a packed  lecture theatre: if one  battle is won, the war goes  on.  HISTORY OF THE PROTEST  Every February, the Engineers'  Undergraduate Society (EUS)  has hired a woman (with student fees) to ride naked on  a horse around campus, accompanied by a rowdy drunken  mob of students.

By reviewing and advising on  Custom's pornography policy  Andrews says, "I can pass  on the wishes of the community to the government."  "I think the government is  showing people it's concerned,"  she says.  At its December meeting, the  committee's first, the 22  members were too busy with  other imports to review the  issue of pornography. Andrews  also discovered, to her dismay, that she is the only  advisor whose interest is in  dealing with pornography. She  is also the only woman on  the committee.  As a result of talking to low  level officials in Toronto  about recent seizures of gay  materials dealing with sodomy,  Andrews says, "customs personnel  are anxious to clean up their  act."  She has also written to Elmer  McKay, Minister of Revenue,  demanding that the sodomy  clause be dropped from customs  pornography guidelines.  Andrews says she has experienced  "conflicts of philosophy" with  people who view violence as an  acceptable part of erotica. "To  me it's still violence, and I  fear violence."  g§pp? to resolve this conflict.  she says, I haven't the faintest idea."  ^Haterials dealing with lesbian  and gay sexuality continue to  be seized at the border.  As recently as December 9  shipments of the book Lesbian  Sex,   as well as other lesbian  materials, have been confiscated at the border.  However, it seems that only  those shipments belonging to  Vancouver's gay/lesbian bookstore Little Sisters have  been affected.  "It's the homophobic attitude of customs" said Jim  Deva, spokesperson for  the store. "Obviously we've  stopped ordering these books."  Deva said the materials were  classified as obscene under  current customs guidelines,  because they depicted anal  stimulation.  Fighting censorship  Activists say valuable  video work in danger  Little Sisters is on their  second appeal against seizures  in Ottawa, "which we fully  expect to be rejected" says  Deva.  In March of 1985 the 1867  customs law forbidding the  importation of anything 'indecent or immoral' was withdrawn because it was too  vague.  Canada Customs has developed  a set of guidelines for its  officers, mostly banning  violent and child pornography.  One guideline, however, includes sodomy, and so has a  direct impact on gay and lesbian sex literature.  The guidelines are due for  review in June of this year,  but according to Deva, there  is concern that the review  couid be held up for another  year.  Ariel Books spokesperson Kate  VanDusen reported no problems  with their shipments of Lesbian  Sex. "I think Little Sisters j  is being set up, she said, and  I think all alternative booksellers should support them."  by Gretchen Lang  In response to government  plans to restrict video distribution, a group of artists,  feminists, and members"of the  gay and lesbian communities  have combined to form a  coalition against censorship.  The Coalition for the Right  To View (CRTV) is now holding meetings to discuss  strategies for fighting  upcoming regulations designed to restrict distribution of certain videos.  Attorney General Brian Smith's  proposed regulations would  ban videos with explicit  scenes of sex with violence,  sex with children or animals,  and scenes of extreme brutality and torture. Video  distributors would need  government approval before  they could sell or rent  certain videos. Guidelines  for which videos would need  to be submitted for inspection have not been established. (See Kinesis Dec./Jan.J  The proposed regulations have  received widespread community  support from church and  women's groups, and will  most likely be adopted by the  government at the March 1st  legislature session.  CRTV opposes the video censorship, and says it will  "make creative and critical  work by artists and educators  difficult orvimpossible and  leave most mainstream anti-  women imagery untouched."  The group also is opposed to  censorship by the Periodical  Review Board, Canada Customs  and the anti-obscenity sections of the Criminal Code.  Sara Diamond, spokesperson for  the coalition, said CRTV believes that "putting resources  into education and teaching consensual sexuality in our  schools is a better approach.  Also finding artists to start  producing images that will be  alternatives to existing porn.  This society's really repressive  We've hardly discussed sex, and  now we're telling each other  what to read? It brings up the  question of why the feminist  community is supporting anything that stifles sexual education."  Coalition members include:  Vancouver Artist's League,  B.C. Civil Liberties Association, Vancouver Lesbian  Connection and Little Sisters  Bookstore.  UBC from previous page  the administration ignored  or disapproved of the ride,  but took no steps to stop it.  Every year the media sensationalized it as rowdy student  fun and the police ignored  it. Also every year, there  have been protests which  the engineers have often  responded to with violence.  • During the 1978 protest,  the campus Women's Centre  was broken into and  vandalized.  • In 1979-80, the engineering  student "NEUSletter" published  the names and telephone numbers of individual women who'd  spoken out against the  event. These women were slandered, intimidated and harassed;  their sense of integrity and  personal safety was violated.  (This "NEUSletter is also known  as "The Red Rag" which printed crude drawings of "twats  and beavers" and male genitalia performing various excretory functions. It also  printed jokes about rape,  incest and similar misogynist "fun".)  • In 1985, peaceful protestors  at the ride were jeered at,  shoved, tripped, and pelted  with ice-balls and eggs. An  engineer leader would call  out "say hello to the women!"  and dozens of male voices  responded "hello assholes!"  After this experience,  people began last spring  to suggest strategies for  stopping the ride and by Nov  ember, CASC had considerable  support from faculty and community members.  The group decided to meet  with the EUS, the student  union representatives and  with various deans and administration members. The EUS  found nothing sexist in the  event (nor in the pin-ups  found on lab walls, for that  matter). They also said that  violence is inherent to the  ride; that "if you step in  front of a moving train,  you're going to get hurt",  and that "if you don't like it,  don't watch." "  The student union representatives responded with staggering,  apathy: half of them abstained  from voting on a motion that  the ride be stopped.  UBC's new president, Dr.  Strangway, said that it was  "inappropriate" and Dr. Meisen  (dean of Applied Science) found  it "offensive to a significant proportion of the university community and to (him)  personally".  However, administration-  officials took no responsibility for doing something concrete  about the event.  On January 16, CASC held a public meeting. They feared disruption of violence, but the  attendance of 300 people, including the media, faculty,  and police prevented that.  Following the meeting community  awareness and support focused  sufficient pressure on the ad  ministration to make UBC promise  sanctions against the engineers if the ride went ahead.  The EUS agreed to make the ride  inoffensive, but refused to  divulge just what changes would  occur.  On February 4, the day of the  event, the engineering students  held a mock memorial service  for the horse that was to have  carried Godiva.  Women engineering students  carried the casket that  revealed horse limbs sticking out from it: apparently  the ride is over. Except,  of course, the engineering  students couldn't end it  quite that simply. To maintain their image of bold  sexism they hired a stripper  for the memorial service,  apparently to assauge their  defeat.

Kinesis March 1  REAL WOMEN  ANNUAL MEETING  Attacks on women dominate convention  by Jane Brown  This article is part of Kinesis'  continuing effort to report on what  the right's organizing priorities  are and. what they believe about  women's rights, feminism and feminists.   (For other stories on Realwomen  see  Kinesis April/84 and May/85)  Formed in February of 1984,. Real-  women's (realistic,  equal and active  for life) aim is to  "promote,  secure  and defend legislation which upholds Judeo-Christian view of the  traditional marriage and- the family. "  Realwomen is opposed to choice on  abortion,  no-fault divorce,  affirmative action,  equal pay for work  of equal value and universal daycare.  They support criminalization of prostitution,  increased family allowance,  a separate mother benefit,   homemakers  pensions and government funded parenting courses.  While the bulk of their platform is anti-  women 's rights on some issues Realwomen  and feminists are in agreement. For  instance feminists have fought for years  for pensions for homemakers and increased  family allowances. Most recently national and provincial women's organizations organized a cross country protest  and petition campaign in a bid to prevent family allowance cutbacks. Real-  women's voice,  however,  was conspicuously absent during this fightback.  The following report was filed from  Toronto by a Kinesis correspondent  who is writing under a pseudonym.  "Realwomen is the new women's movement,"  Realwomen's co-founder and legal  counsel Gwen Landolt proclaimed at the  organization's second annual meeting  in Toronto in February. "Each of you  can be proud that you are part and  parcel of a better world tomorrow."  "You" was an audience of about 225  women, and a handful of men, no more  than attended last year's conference.  Attendance was primarily from southern  Ontario, with a few women from British  Columbia, Alberta and Quebec. A surprisingly large number of women were  in the 20-35 age group. According to  Realwomen president Grace Petrasek the  organization is getting a good response  through media publicity, "particularly  from young women staying at home."  The organization, which was founded in  1983, claims a.membership of 20,000.  However when the membership part of  the meeting was held only 65 of the 225  attenders remained in the Royal York  ballroom, where Treasurer Margaret  Goodier reported a 1985 income from  membership fees and donations (no  breakdowns) of $18,086. The group had  to raise its membership fee from $5  to $10 in the last year in order to  cover costs, Petrasek explained.  Real women have been pressuring the  federal government to grant them  what Landolt calls the "dinky little  sum" of more than $1 million—a catch  amount since "the radical feminists have  had all these years to plant the seeds  of disharmony and despair" . In fact, one  of the group's most persistent demands  has been that they receive equal funding  or there be no funding at all. Since its  founding, the organization's main hobbyhorse has been criticism of government  funding of "radical feminist" organiza-  The refusal of funding for Realwomen  from the Secretary of State Women's  Programme was one of the best things  that happened, Landolt said. It certainly gave the organization the opportunity to smear "the radical feminists  (who) control the money in Secretary of  State," who Landolt named as Maureen  O'Neill and Lise Blanchard.  At the moment the organization is riding  high, having found a friend  at last in federal Health,and Welfare  minister Jake Epp.  "Jake Epp is a man who seems to understand the importance of the family in  Canada," Landolt told the meeting. She  credited Epp with having established "a  task force on child care in the Canadian  family." For Realwomen the icing on the  cake is his appointment of MP Shirley  Martin (PC-Lincoln), who Landolt called  "sympathetic" to Realwomen, as the Chair  of the task force.  Urging Realwomen to make submissions to  the task force, Landolt said this is  the first time the government has acknowledged "it's family care1.1 the children of Canada need. She suggested her  audience recommend the government provide money for in-home care or institute  The radical feminists have had  all these years to plant seeds of  disharmony and despair.  a homemaker's tax credit in order to  allow mothers to stay at home.  Besides Epp, Realwomen seems to have  made friends during their June and  November lobbies of the Conservatives  and Liberal MPs.  Landolt reported MPs as saying 'thank  heavens there/are women in this world  we can feel comfortable with.'  Her sources report that Realwomen's  pressure has paid off in turmoil—  "There's not a (Tory) caucus meeting  without someone getting up asking  about our funding"—and an appointment  with Secretary of State Benoit Bou-  chart in late February.  According to reports from B.C. and  Alberta Realwomen have also been busy  at the regional level.  The liaison person from the Alberta  Federation of WOmen United for Families (AWFUF)—the group that kicked  off anti-feminist women's organizing  in Canada—reported that AFWUF has  spent the last year presenting briefs  on education, child and elderly benefits, equality rights and no-fault  divorce. Underlining Realwomen's connections to Right to Life, she said a  detailed account of AFWUF's annual  meeting could be found in Interim,   the  Right to Life newspaper. .  "People are flocking to us," said Peggy Stacy from British Columbia. With  more than 1,000 people on the B.C.  chapter's mailing list ("three to four  thousand if we count the way the feminists do"), she said groups have  formed in Surrey, White Rock, Burnaby  and on Vancouver Island. A high point  for the B.C. chapter in 1985 was being  asked last spring to take over running  the Vancouver Transition House, she  said.  Besides presenting a brief to the  Common's equality rights committee,  Realwomen in B.C. have been fighting  Kinesis,  which she described as,  "Marxist-lesbian news published with  your tax money." Calling Vancouver  the "lesbian and gay capital of Canada," Stacy said, "we're surrounded!  out there. And it's no wonder they  call it the granola capital. We've  got all the nuts and flakes."  Stacy concluded her report by exhorting her audience to "come out and  see us in the summer for Expo. We need  you."  Along with reports on Realwomen business, the audience heard three guest  speakers and a panel of Realwomen representing different sectors of the  female population. All speakers shared  the assumption that they were speaking  on God's behalf.  The morning opened with an address by  Onalee McGraw, a former education  consultant with the right-wing, Moral  Majority-backed Heritage Foundation  in Washington, D.C. Speaking on "The  Family, Feminism and the State," McGraw  set the tone for the day.  McGraw began with an attack on daycare,  moving from criticism of full-time working mothers ("It really is a matter  not of quality time but time period")  to the bizarre assertion that infants  and toddlers are being exposed to a  growing number of daycare diseases because they were not meant to be in  collective situations.  Moving on to adolescent sexuality,  McGraw criticized sex education and  gave a truly racist impersonation  of a Black single mother refusing  contraceptive counselling ("He ain't  gonna do me like that again. No way.").  This, of course, was to illustrate  her argument that sex education was  useless anyway, because "there is  no way kids are going to contracept  unless they are taken by the hand."  Sexually active teens, she said, are  the children who have been denied a  warm, loving, caring family by working mothers.  McGraw's concluding words urged Real-  women to remain calm: "You will be  used by God as His instrument. Look  at our fellow sisters who don't understand a lot of these things. They suffer  and their children suffer. We have to  love them."  REAL Women continued next page  "Some day all  this will  be yours. Kinesis March 1986  ACROSS CANADA  Ontario to legalize  midwifery  The Ontario government will  soon legalize the practice  of midwifery and is examining,  the possibility of giving  midwives a range of rights  and responsibilities unparalleled in Canada.  Currently, it's not technically illegal to practise midwifery but those who serve  as midwives are not recognized  by provincial law nor are  there facilities to train  them.  ■ Ontario will.establish midwifery as a recognized part  of its healthcare system,  Health Minister Murray  Elston said yesterday.  But Mr. Elston has first set  up a task force to examine  the functions that midwives  will perform and how independently they will operate from  doctors.  The task force, which does not  include any midwives, will  tackle the thorny question  of whether midwives can become  a self-regulating profession,  as they want.  Despite the lack of midwives  on the panel, the announcement  of the task force, was welcomed  by Vicki Van Wagner, a spokeswoman for the Association of  Ontario Midwives.  Mr. Elston said that since  midwives have an uncertain  legal status, established institutions and professions  are often reluctant to deal  with.them.  In B.C., where delivery by mid-  wives' is illegal, two Vancouver  area midwives, Mary Sullivan  and Gloria Lemay, were charged  with criminal negligence causing death after a baby died at  a hospital last May.  The Sullivan/Lemay trial is  slated to begin on May 12 in  Vancouver. A rally has been  called for May 12 outside the  court house before the trial  begins.

V5R 4G8  REAL Women from previous page  Christianity is the underpinning of  Realwomen and their American counterparts. The audience appeared to be  largely Roman Catholic (two speakers contributed anecdotes about Mother Teresa's  spunky remarks to those communists in  Red China). They see their mission as  fighting "secular humanism" which puts  humanity at the centre of the universe  rather than God. At the same time, many  of the audience members appeared to  have a sense of their own worth as  women.  This attitude was most apparent during  the luncheon.address by the truly  offensive Dr. Donald de Marco, a philosophy professor at St. Jerome's college in Waterloo, Ontario, and president  of Birthright. De Marco is also the author of several books on secular  humanism and the 'contraceptive society.'  His address, 'Forty Favourite Femmes,'  was supposed to be humourous but the  anti-woman remarks fell flat in places.  Opening with a quote from Euripides—  "There is no worse evil than a bad  woman, nothing better than a good one"  —he blessed some women with praise:  Mother Teresa, Flannery O'Connor,  Enrico Caruso's mother) and attacked  others—(Judy Erola, Susan Brownmiller  and Sister Jane Boyer), who called  Mother Teresa the "patron saint of the  status quo."  He drew gasps from the audience when  he blasted a spirituality conference  in Montana for including witches who  sold T-shirts saying, "Nothing says  lovin' like something from the coven."  But when he recited other supposedly  shocking T-shirt slogans, the audience  laughed and applauded at "Women who  seek to be equal to men lack ambition."  Several women commented during the  afternoon break that they found his  address too flippant.  De Marco was followed in the afternoon by Dr. Matthew McQueen, a member  of the pathology department at McMaster  University and counsellor in natural  birth control. In an interesting although  somewhat dry discourse on the medical  research into oral contraceptives, he  told opponents of contraception that  they only hurt themselves by distorting the facts about the pill in  order to scare women.  In what could otherwise have been  a progressive talk on informed consent,  he lapsed into a diatribe on the  rights of fathers, and a condemnation of  the "contraceptive mentality (that)  fosters the idea that sexual relations  must be carefree."  The panel presented a cross-section  of Realwomen's views. Marian Snyder,  "almost 25-years-oId," from Whitby,  Ontario, was supposed to represent  the single, career woman, but her  message was really that of the giving-  up-my-career-when-I-get-married-in-  . May woman. Snyder said she became  involved in Realwomen because of its  'pro-life' message.  Target; Kinesis  Throughout th* past year Realwomen's~  most concrete political goal has been,  to either acquire funding from the  Secretary of State's Women's Program ;  or, if they are not funded, to force  the government to cut the Program  entirely, Realwomen applied for Woman's  Program funding in 1985 and were re- -  fused because it did not meet the  Women's Program criteria which calls  for the full equality of women.

J  Snyder is a legal secretary who,  until she got engaged,, had planned to  go to law school. Now, she says, "if  I'm getting married my top priority  and commitment should be the family."  She says that one of-the biggest  struggles for young women is that  "society says we're more valuable if  we're bringing in money. You always  feel on the defensive. Women 'need the  choice to do what they think is im  portant." For her, Realwomen of  Canada is realistic. It says "families  are the cornerstone of society and  women are the backbones of families."  Joey Buwalda, also from Whitby and  representing the full-time mother,  was the first woman to study sign-  writing at a local community college.  She is the mother of three children  and provides daycare in her home.  Buwalda gave the most explicit expression of 'born-again' thought, saying  "Unless the Lord builds the house,  those who build it labour in vain.  That applies to Realwomen. Unless I  let the Lord use me in my speech today, my speech is in vain. He is trusting me with His reputation."  Representing the working mother was  Susan Hedges, from Barrie, Ontario.  She began working part-time when her  husband was laid off from his job.  She now works almost full-time for  MacDonald's, where she has flexible  hours allowing her to be home when her  children get in from school. Hedges  used her own experiences as a young,  married woman to point out that many  women feel taken for granted and isolated as wives and mothers. "It's  Realwomen, she said, that has given  mothers a voice in society."  A Realwomen convention is a perplexing  experience for any feminist.  While it may be tempting to dismiss  the leadership, and their mean spirited  smears on Canadian feminists, it's  clear that Realwomen's most' successful  recruitment is of women who believe  feminists do not care about their  concerns.  Feminists were the first to point  out that women's concerns have never  had any vital importance to society.  Women's values, needs and goals have  never been central; centrality  has always been a male right.  Realwomen, motivated by fundamentalist  religious beliefs and a strong anti-  choice position, clearly hold feminists  responsible for the vulnerability of  Feminists must pander whether there is  any possibility of dialogue with  Realwomen or whether there is an insurmountable gap between 'us' and 'them.

Kinesis March 1986     7  ACROSS CANADA  Lesbian family wins health benefits  by Nancy Pollak  A 25 year old Ontario woman  has fought for—and won—the  right to have her woman lover  and that woman's children  covered by her employee health  insurance plan. Karen Andrews  a worker at a Toronto Public  Libarayi was able to use the  clause in her union contract  prohibiting discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation to persuade Cumba,  a major health insurer, to  extend full benefits to  her lover and the children they  support.'  Andrews' efforts began last  March when she applied to have  her lover Mary Trenholme and  j  her two teenage daughters protected by the plan. They had  been living together for  seven years. Cumba's definition of 'eligible spouse'  mirrored that of the provincial Health Insurance Act  which states that only "legal  spouses" and unmarried, unemployed dependent children  under 21 are eligible. Common-  law spouses may also be  claimed.  When her application was refused, she filed a grievance  against her employer, the  Toronto Library Board. Her  union, the Canadian Union  of Public Employees, argued  that, since the employer had  undertaken to not discriminate  against gay workers and had  also promised family coverage to, employees, it was the  Library Board's responsibility  to either find an insurer  that would agree to full coverage or foot the medical and  dental bills of dependents  of gay workers.  Just before the case went to  arbitration, Cumba did a  turn-around and consented to  carry Trenholme and her children. Andrews and the union  are still proceeding with the  grievance in order to gain  Ontario Health Insurance  benefits (the equivalent of  B.C.'s Medical Services  Plan) for her—and other gay  people's—families.  In British Columbia, a lesbian  employed by the provincial  government" is waging a similar  battle, with the enthusiastic  support of her B.C.G.E.U.  local. She too has the leverage of a union contract clause  disallowing discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation.

Ontario judge gives  blessing to pro-life clerics  First contract imposed  at Commerce VISA Centre  The Canada Labour Relations  Board (CLRB) has ordered an  end to the strike at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Visa centre. The  decision by the federal panel  marks only the fifth time  the CLRB has imposed a first  contract since it was given  the power to do so in 1978.  The Visa centre's 220 employees have been on strike since  June when 160 Visa workers,  represented by the Union of  Bank Employees, walked out to  press demands for a first  contract. The workers were  joined by about 60 mail room  workers in September.  The contract, which union  officials say far surpasses  any other agreement in the  largely unorganized banking  industry, provides increased  recognition of seniority, a  wide scope for grieving the  banks' actions and a five  percent wage increase for  all employees earning the  minimum rate for their job  classification.  In what the union describes  as a disappointing move, however, the CLRB has permitted  the Commerce to retain its'  practise of providing pay  increases based on merit. The  contract also fails to provide any increase in benefit  plans.  The Commerce, which originally  said it would fight the CLRB's  decision to impose a contract,  has now said it is satisfied  with the contract and will  withdraw its court challenge  against the contract.  The Canadian Labour Congress,  which viewed the Visa strike  as a watershed in its efforts  to organize the finance industry, pay $300 dollars weekly  to the striking workers.  "We're looking at a very significant political decision  in this country that says not  only to the banking industry  but to other industries that  when you have an apparent  and obvious inbalance of  power, there is a way for  workers to get justice and  that is the imposition of an  agreement by the labour board"  said Buzz Hargrove, a strike  supporter.  The Board order prohibits reprisals for any strike related  activity. The order will not  affect about 15 criminal charges laid against strikers for  picket line incidents. Some  strikers have also laid counter-charges against workers,  who crossed the picket line.  About 100 anti-union employees  who crossed the picket line  during the strike have, however,  applied for a halt to the  CLRB back-to-work order. The  workers are launching a broad  challenge to the Board's jurisdiction in the case. It is  unclear whether the workers will  go ahead with their court challenge .  by Gretchen Lang  Three clergymen, who padlocked  the gates of the Morgantaler  abortion clinic in Toronto, have  been acquitted of mischief charges, in a precedent-setting  decision that pro-choice activists find disturbing.  The provincial court judge  in the case, Lorenzo Di-Cecco,  also decided not to order  the three clergymen to to  stay away from the Morgentaler clinic. Under common-  law a judge can impose such  a bond iespite an acquittal  if there is fear of a future  breach of the peace.  In February, Di-Cecco acquitted ReverandsTed Colleton,  Alphonse SeValk and Pastor  .Fred Vaughan and said that  citizens have a limited right  to try and stop a criminal  act. He added that though  doctors inside the clinic have  not been arrested for illegal  activities, that did not mean  that offenses were not taking,  place.  At the trial the clerics read  the judge a statement saying  they will not obey any conditions on their acquittal  ■ and also told Toronto reporters they are ready to go  to jail because of this  "serious moral issue."  Di-Cecco admitted in his  decision that it has not  been decided whether or not  crimes are being committed  inside the clinic. The  Ontario government is pre^  sently"appealing the 1984  acquittal of Morgantaler  on illegal abortion charges.  In an interview with the Globe  & Mail,  Crown, attorney Peter  Griffiths was upset by the broad  implications of the judgment,  saying it was a fundamental  error in the law to encourage  citizens to take the law into  their own hands.  Judy Rebick, spokesperson for  the Ontario Coalition for Abortion Rights, said the decision  "is a licence to increase the  harassment and physical intimidation at the clinic." Judge  Marva Blackmore, spokesperson for Vancouver's Concerned Citizens for Choice  on Aboriton, said that Judge  Di-Cecco is known to believe  that abortion is murder.  She said the problem lies  with one man, possibly biased,  making the decision. "If they  went before a jury, she said,  I'm sure.they would not be  acquitted."  Equal pay for government workers  Business reassured in Ontario  by Nancy Pollak  The Ontario government will  soon introduce legislation  to "eliminate the traditional  wage-gap between female and  male civil servants. Stemming  from a promise made by the  governing Liberals to the  N.D.P. this move should  provide for equal pay for work  of equal value.  Under the legislation, pay-  equity adjustments would be  negotiated between the Government and unions representing  the 75,000 public sector  workers. The first step would  involve agreeing upon a job  evaluation method free of  sex bias. This would then be  used to assess the skill,  effort,-responsibility and  working conditions associated  with any given job. When a  traditionally female occupation is found to be paid less  than a male-dominated category  with equivalent requirements,  the pay would be adjusted to  the higher level.  The amount of money needed to  initially close the wage gap  is estimated at close to $80  million. Women employees will  have to wait up to 3% years  for the pay-outs to begin.  The prospects for women working outside government are  far different. The Ontario  Liberals have made no move  to introduce equal-pay legislation for the private  sector, and have assured  business that they have nothing to fear.  These assurances become tangible when the government  named to the province's equal--  pay consultation panel two men  whose firms lack affirmative  action programs and whose  personnel managers belong to  an organization that has  publicly attacked equal pay  laws.

This discussion between two women is the second of a, two part series:  Rosalind: How will free trade affect  Jeanette: There are two distinct aspects  to this question. For women as customers  free trade might be beneficial, as it  could open up a wider range of goods and  services at lower prices. But for women  as producers of goods and services the  situation is somewhat different: it depends on the type of work they do.  More than 80 per cent of women workers  are employed in the service sector. It  is clear that the U.S. wants to include  trade in services on the free trade  agenda. The effect here is hard to predict. We'll talk about it later. Let's  first deal with manufacturing, where we  can predict the results of free trade  with more certainty.  About one out of every eight of all  working women is employed in manufacturing. However, over half of these women are employed in what's called light  secondary manufacturing industries.  Right now most of these industries are  protected by fairly high tariff barriers  - and they're the industries most likely  to be affected by free trade.  R.    In what specific ways will free  trade affect these industries?  J. Let's take some specific examples.  At least six industries are likely to be  quite vulnerable in a free trade market:  textiles, clothing, small electrical  products, sporting goods, toys and  games, and leather products.  Even with protection from tariffs and  non-tariff barriers (like quotas on  imports into Canada), it's hard for most  of these industries to maintain their  domestic market share.  A lot of the competition comes from low  wage developing countries. Many women  working in these industries in Canada  ^j| REMODELLING  wmm Judith A.

Women in manufacturing would  face deteriorating working  conditions and lower  wages  Without protection of tariffs and other  trade barriers, Canadian firms would certainly try to follow the Americans and  lower working conditions here. They would  claim they had to, to survive. Thus many  women employed in manufacturing would  face deteriorating working, conditions  and lower wages just to meet the U.S.  competition, with the alternative being  the closing of that industry.  R.    What about my friend who works in a  plywood plant here in B.C.  The forest  products industry seems very much in favour of free trade.  Will it be good for  my friend?  J.  No, not if she's working in the plywood industry. You see, the plywood industry is not typical of the B.C. forest  industry. Most of the forest industry  makes intermediate products - lumber,  newsprint, and pulp - and these goods are  already mainly exported, mostly to the  U.S.- They are not presently subject to  tariff or non-tariff barriers.  But to try to avoid closing mills and  laying off workers, B.C. companies have  been exporting record high volumes of  lumber to the U.S. at record low prices.  This doesn't produce record profits. What  Copper 7 from page 1  tinuing sales in Canada and over a 100  other countries poses a serious contra  dict ii  aid 1  ; Thompson, health  collective spokeswoman.  According to Thompson the Copper 7 has  a serious design flaw which Seale has  never acted upon.  The string of the Copper 7, which is  folded before being inserted into the  uterus, may return to its original  folded position inside the body instead  of hanging down, Thomson said. When the  strings are not accessible, says  Thompson, the IUD can become lodged in  the uterus and cause infections.  James Rae, general manager for Seale's  Canadian subsidiary, says the decision  to stop selling the Copper 7 in the U.S.  was made for "purely financial reasons."  "The cost of litigation is extremely expensive," he said adding that the company  recently spent $1.5 million (against  annual sales of 11 million).  ^^^TM  in  backdoor  has happened is that the U.S. lumber producers view this flood of Canadian products as a threat and thus are urging  protectionist action by Congress against  Canadian lumber*  A very big reason why the forest industry  in B.C. is so vocal in its support of  free trade is to try to avoid the imposition of tariffs and quotas by the U.S. on  B.C. lumber, as this would have a devastating effect here.  Unlike lumber, plywood is a protected  product in both Canada and the U.S. Producers serve only their respective domestic markets. Over the years the cost of  plywood production in Canada has become  relatively high. In fact some American  plywood costs so much less to produce  that it can be sold in Canada despite the  tariff - it makes it over the tariff bar-.  from substitute producfel*£ike particle-  board. These products are not only less  expensive to produce, they are also more  capital and energy intensive, and less  labour intensive - thus, fewer jobs. In  addition, expansion in production is more  likely in the United States.  R.    So even if my friend gets training  for a job in the particleboard industry  she 'd then have to move! Is free trade  likely to force a lot of workers to  change cities or provinces to get a job?  J. Very probably. It's what economists  call dislocation. It's part of what are  called "adjustment costs". No one really  knows what these will be in Canada. But  one in five workers in Canada would be  facing location changes in their employ-  And it's still a lot harder for women to  relocate and find new employment than for  men. Women also tend to be less readily  accepted in training programs - especially those offering long-term skills training. The way it's put is, "Women are less  willing to undertake adaptive behavior."  It's a vicious spiral. Men make jnore  money than do women for work of equal  value. So families must depend more on  the men's wages. So women can't move. So  they're ruled out of retraining programs  for well-paying new jobs. So men make  more money than women...  ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■....  Free Trade could be one of several factors that lead to a new division  in society- in which people in well paid secure jobs require service  from others whose jobs tend to be poorly paid  transientand 'dead-end'  ■HMHHHNHHHHHHHNHHHI  That gives an indication of how trade r  would flow if the barrier were removed -  U.S. plywood could flood the Canadian  market. Your friend's, job in a B.C. plywood plant could vanish almost overnight.  R. Well, maybe that would be good. The  working conditions in the plywood factory  seem more stressful than my bother's gob  in a sawmill, especially because of the  smell of the adhesives. She also earns a  lot less than my brother. Wouldn't it be  better for her if the plywood plant were  to close, and she were to ge-t a job in  an expanding area of the industry where  free trade was providing more - and better - jobs?  J.  That's the free trade theory exactly!  The inefficient light manufacturing industries, like plywood, will go under.  But the free traders say this will be  more than compensated for by expansion  in areas where Canada has a comparative  advantage.  But what does that really mean? Does it  mean more and better jobs for Canadians?  Will the supposed increase in the economic pie be accessible to everyone, and  shared by everyone? Will jobs lost by  women be replaced by other jobs for women? It's not that simple.  For instance surviving firms would likely be economically efficient - but working conditions could suffer. There could  be even less.consideration for the worker, heaping more demands on her, and at  lower wages.  Because we are now facing a shortage of  trees it will be hard for the lumber,  newsprint and pulp industries, with their  more highly skilled, predominantly male  workforce, to expand. Better economic  conditions would mean more money available to forest management - so there  might be more jobs in silviculture.  And back to plywood. It doesn't just face  competition from U.S. plywood but also  if. What about the service.industry?  Will free trade create jobs there?  J. We're talking about private sector  industries like insurance, banking,  transportation, data processing, and  communications - as well as personal  services like hairdressing and waitressing. And few of these are extensively  unionized industries.  There are several forms of protection  for service industries from foreign competition: commercial regulations and  licensing, Canadian content guidelines,  government restrictions (as of foreign  transportation and communications operations .  It's also true that many services,  especially personal services, must be  local. You're not going to find many  people heading down to Bellingham or  Seattle to get haircuts - a few, but not  many!  However, changes in technology threaten  some service jobs. You may remember the  Insurance Corporation of B.C. sent some  of its clerical work to the Philippines  a couple of years ago. Data processing  formerly had to be done locally; now  technology allows firms to send it anywhere. Government regulations could make  sure these jobs stay in Canada - if the  government wants them to - that would be  a non-tariff barrier.  But over all free trade could be one of  several factors that lead to a new division in society - in which people in  well-paid secure employment require increased personal services from a growing  number of others whose jobs tend to be  poorly-paid, transient, and 'dead-end'.  R.    Isn 't that already happening in the  United States?  J.  It's a clear result of "Reaganomics".  In the States a lot of industries have  been deregulated, such as the transporta  tion sector. We all know about the fierce  competition among U.S. airlines and the  toll it has taken on wages and working  conditions. The current labour unrest in  the Canadian airline industry stems from  deregulation's approach. Most of the  workers in the airline industry are women.  Free trade would put extra pressure on  Canada to follow the U.S. lead. The process begun by the Liberals and continued  by the Tories in Ottawa has taken us some  way along the road to deregulation in  both transportation and communications.  Deregulation puts even more of a burden on  people living outside large cities. Supposedly airline tickets between big cities,  freight along main lines, or long distance  phone calls will get cheaper. But air  services to smaller communities, freight  along branch lines, and local telephone  calls will cost more.  Many businesses want free trade so they  can take advantage of currently lower  costs in transportation services in the  U.S. They also hope free trade will speed  deregulation in Canada. Cheaper transportation and communication costs could mean  lower market prices, and more sales for  Canadian businesses.  R.    If goods are cheaper due to lower  transportation costs,  isn't that a  "good  thing"? ,'  J. Only if you think of yourself simply  as a customer. But suppose you belong to a  transportation union? As labour struggles  in the airline industry show, anticipated  deregulation is making collective bargaining very difficult. Deregulation is supposed to encourage competition, but if, in "  addition to removing regulations, it  erodes the strength of" organized labour to  bargain collectively, what is to prevent  cut throat competition from eroding hard  won standards in health and safety and pay  equity?  Then there's the question of Canadian social services. Is it "fair" to Canadian  companies to shoulder the burden of Medicare, or Unemployment Insurance, or Workers' Compensation, if American corporations donjt have to pay as much for such  social services in the U.S.?  If Canadian corporations don't pay their  present share of these social costs, who  will? We have to think about what kind of  society we want to live in.  On the face of it, free trade appears to  be the lowering of tariff barriers to give  Canadians access to the much larger American market, and the opportunity for increased sales and efficiency. But the  introduction of free trade could be just a  backdoor method to bring Reaganomics to  Canada. That's what we need to worry about.  Even if the total economic impact is positive, many individuals and communities in  Canada will face severe adjustment costs -  the proponents of free trade admit this.  What we could lose are a lot of rights and  powers workers now have earned through  collective action and Canada's superior  social safety nets.  The question isn't simply will Canada as a  whole be richer and better off with free  trade - it's who  in Canada is going to be  richer and better off? The young or the  old? Central Canadians or those in other  regions? The skilled or the unskilled? The  affluent or the poor? Managers or workers?  Women or men? If we have decreased workers rights and social services it's clear  women would be the hardest hit.  All of us, especially women, must be involved in these discussions and be clear  as to what we value in our society. This  is not an easy task, but we must begin by  being informed, asking questions, and  thinking of the long-term consequences of  free trade. 10   Kinesis March 1986  Women Against Violence Against Women / Rape Crisis Centre  ^CELEBRATES     OUR    4TH    YEAR  AND    WISHES    ALL    WOMEN  A     HAPPY  INTERNATIONAL     WOMEN'S     DAY  mm • .* THEATRE *• Hi  For the best in Foreign Films  and Independent Quality Films  Non-Sexist, Coffee Bar, Crying Room for parents  with small children  Happy International Women's Day!  16th and ARBUTUS STREET .

From  the beginning of the 20th century,  many women in industrially developing  countries were entering the paid work  force. Their jobs were sex segregated,  mainly in textiles,  manufacturing and  domestic services where conditions  were horrible and wages worse than  depressed.  Trade unions were also  developing and industrial disputes  broke out,   including some among  sections of non-unionised women workers.  In Europe,   there was revolution  in the air.  The general strike  There had been demonstrations and  strikes by women garment workers  before 1909. But, this strike was  different. Instead of 2,000 workers  on strike, there were 30,000 workers  on strike. This almost shut down  the garment industry. By the time  the strike was over, it had changed  the course of the labour movement  and organized more women than had  ever been unionized before.  In 1909, more than 30,000 shirtwaist makers were employed: 80%  were women and 70% were between the  ages of 16 and 25 years old; 65% of  the women employed in the trade were  Jewish, 26% were Italian and 8% were  native born; the remainder were a  mixture of Polish, German and Irish  women.  The strike began at the Triangle  Shirtwaist Company on September 27,  1909. Later, the workers at the  Leiserson Company joined the strike.  For two months, workers at these two  shops were picketing for the right  to organize and to bargain collectively for improved wages and working  conditions.  The general strike began on November 22,  1909. On that day, the United Hebrew  Trades (a coalition of Jewish socialist unions) and Local 25 of the  International Ladies Garment Workers  Union called a meeting of all shirtwaist makers in New York City.  Thousands of workers came.  Samual Gompers, head of the American  Federation of Labour, spoke; so did  Mary Dreier, head of the Women's  Trade Union League; and, as usual  at such meetings, Jacob Panken and  Meyer London, the big guns of Jewish  socialism. But, no clear strategy  had been worked out by the Local's  leadership, and the speakers, hesitating before the prospect of an  ill-prepared general strike, could  not decide between exhortation and  caution.  As the evening dragged along, and speaker  followed speaker, a frail, teenage girl  named Clara Lemich, who had been picketing at the Leiserson Plant day after day,  raced up to the platform. She burst  into a flow of passionate yiddish which  would remain engraved in thousands of  memories:  "I am a working girl, one of those  striking against intolerable conditions . I am tired of listening to  speakers who talk in generalities.  What we are here for -is to decide  whether or not to strike. I offer a  resolution that a general strike be  decleared—now."  The excitement was contagious. Repeating an old Jewish oath, the workers  voted unanimously to strike.  The Women's Trade Union League sent  help to the picket lines, and wealthy New  York women such as Mrs. Oliver Belmont  and Anne Morgan provided bail money.  -Wellesley students donated $1,000 to  the strike fund.  In the first month alone 723 girls were  arrested and 19 sent to the workhouse;  the average daily bill for bail came  to $2,500. Sentencing a striker, magistrate Olmstead declared, "You are  on strike against God and nature, whose  firm law is that man shall earn his  bread by the sweat of his brow."  The strike dragged on until mid-February 1910, and was finally settled with,  improvements in working conditions but  without the formal recognition for  which the International Ladies Garment  Worker's Union had held out.  In the immigrant world, the shirtwaist  makers had created indescribable excitement : the strike came to be called  the "uprising of the twenty thousand"  and the phrase should be taken as more  than socialist rhetoric, for it was  indeed an uprising of people who discovered on the picket lines their  sense of dignity and self.  International Women'sDay  In 1910, "Women's Day" was taken up by  socialists and feminists throughout  the country. Later that year, delegates  went to the Second International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen. They were planning to propose  that "Women's Day" become an International event. Women from 17 different  countries were at the conference. They  represented unions, socialist parties  and working women's clubs.  Clara Zetkin, a well-known socialist/  feminist leader, presented a motion:  Women throughout the world should focus  on a particular day each year to press  for their demands, to commemorate women  and their struggles. Women at the Conference greeted Clara Zetkin's motion  with,unanimous approval and "International Women's Day" was the result.  MARCH 8  The first International Women's Day was  held on March 19, 1911 in Germany,  Austria, Denmark and other European  countries. This date was chosen by  German women because, on that date in  1848, the Prussian King had promised  reforms, including votes and civil  rights for women. Although his promise  was broken, the date was remembered by  future generations for its symbolism  and historic importance.  Today we celebrate International  Women's Day on March 8. In 1891, the  Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia declared March 8 "International Working Women's Day" to encourage solidarity with working women  and socialist women in other countries.  The Triangle Shirtwaist Company Fire  Garment industry employers continued  to ignore basic health and safety  regulations although the shirtwaist  makers' contract had included some  improvement. Some examples of their  disregard were: inadequate protection in case of fire; dirty floors,  ceilings, walls and water closets;  defective plumbing; lack of adequate  ventilation;, lack of receptacles for  rubbish; overcrowding; pollution of  the air by the use of coal and gas  irons; strain on eyesight due to inadequate lighting; and certain harmful effects of the work itself.  It was conditions like these which  caused the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company on March 25, 193)1. One  hundred and seventy-five men, women  and children died that day. Many of  them jumped to their death to escape  being burned alive. The immigrant community was in a state of shock.  There was an investigation and charges were laid. The triangle shirtwaist  company was found not guilty.  The Petrograd strike  The most memorable International Women's  Day was held in Petrograd (now Leningrad)  on March 8, 1917 (February 23 by the  old Calendar). Women textile workers  had been urged not to strike by communist leaders. But, when workers of  the Putilov Armaments Plant were  locked out on March 7, the women of  Petrograd began to storm the streets.  As these women swept through the city  over the next few days in food riots,  political strikes and demonstrations,  they began the first revolution of  1917.  We take pride that we are continuing  a tradition filled with courage and  determination not to settle for second best. As we learn our herstory,  about struggles and victories of the  past, we continue to honour the heroines (often nameless) who have shown  us that women have not been silent.

"Crippled" is a degrading term that lumps  all disabilities together and reduces  people with disabilities to only their  disability.    Sorry.  *********  I was stopped at a traffic light in Vancouver 's poorest neighbourhood when I  happened to see a little scene of city  life that I can't help feeling is wildly  significant in a most perverse way.  As I waited for the light to turn green,  the doors opened on the fire house a  block away, a siren sounded and a fair  sized fire truck (lights flashing and  siren blaring) sped out of the garage. It  drove the block to our intersection and  . stopped in front of a restaurant. Three  men in their firemen hats and coats with  high rubber boots and one man in his navy  blue uniform with red emblems over the  shoulders got off the truck and walked up  to a man lying on the sidewalk outside  the restaurant. One of the firemen leaned  over and talked to the man while the  other three stood around at the man's  feet. Then the fireman who had leaned  over, grabbed the man under the arms,  pulled him into a sitting position and  leaned him against the restaurant. One of  the other firemen got out a pad and pencil and started taking notes.  Then the light changed and traffic began  to move taking me with it. I drove as  slowly as I could hoping to see the end  of the scene and maybe make some sense  out of what I had seen. But they remained  as I had seen them. The man leaned up  against the restaurant wall with four  firemen standing around, three of them  wearing their firemen hats and coats and  high rubber boots, one of them taking  notes.  Why, I asked myself, would firemen go  .like that to help a man lying on the  street? When I couldn't think of any possible answer I asked a friend of mine who  works in that neighbourhood. She didn't  seem to think the scene was as bizarre as  I had thought it was.  "Maybe they thought he needed the resus-  citator" she said. Fair enough, I thought.  Who knows what they were told on the  phone. If they thought they needed the  resuscitator, that could explain the fire  truck, the siren and the lights, but what  about the firefighting hats and coats and  high rubber boots? For a while I imagined  going up to the firehouse and just asking  them, but I couldn't imagine them telling  me.  I don't know why that man was lying on  the sidewalk in the middle of winter. I  think it's safe to say he needed help,  but I seriously doubt that he had much  use for a firetruck and four firemen with  their fire fighting hats and coats and  their high rubber boots. If those firemen  had been mental patients it would have  gone on their charts that they were behaving inappropriately. I don't think  it's the firemen's fault though; I think  they were set up.  He probably needed those four firemen  about as much as the Downtown Eastside  needs Expo. There's a lesson in there  somewhere. I know it.  On behalf of the 34,000 members of the  B.C. Government Employees' Union, I  extend greetings on the occasion of  International Women's Day 1986 and  take this opportunity to re-affirm our  commitment to equality for the working  women of British Columbia.

Some of the scenarios are true, in  other words they have already happened.  If you think the scenario is true, circle T for true. Others are technologically possible but for ethical or practical reasons "we" have not chosen to  implement them. For the purpose of this  quiz I consider these scenarios to be  false. Finally, some of the scenarios  are not within the realm of technological possibility - not this month anyway.  These are also False. See if you know  just how far we have come, (baby); you  may be surprised.  True    False    1. In California, Shelley, a  black woman, gives birth  to blonde haired, blue-  eyed infant while the  beaming father looks on.  It is the first time Shelley and the father have  met.  True    False     2. A single woman in Vancouver, wishing to be pregnant, applies to an American sperm bank for sperm  with which to inseminate  herself. Upon learning  that the woman is single  the firm denies her request.  True False 3. A single man in Vancouver  wants to have a child. He  applies to an American  company which "supplies"  surrogate mothers. Due to  his marital status his request is turned down.  True    False    4.  True    False    5.  True    False    6.  Mary and John K. Normally  are a happily married couple. Mary is pregnant for  the first time. Both agree  that the child should be  a boy because it is unhealthy for a male child  to be dominated by an  older sister. Two months  into the pregnancy Mary  goes into the hospita'l  for a test which will determine the sex of her  baby, and on finding out  that she carries a girl  she has the fetus aborted.  Jane and Emily are a lesbian couple. Jane is pregnant and for political  reasons would like to have  a girl. Two months into  the pregnancy Jane is given a test to determine the  sex of the child, and  aborts on finding out that  it is a boy. Unfortunately,  tests are not always correct and the fetus turns  out to be female.  Estelle works in a pigment  factory outside of Vancouver. Five years ago the  women working in her area  (one of the more highly  paid jobs in the plant)  almost lost their jobs  when it was discovered  that the chemicals they  worked with damaged the  genetic material in their  eggs.  Fortunately, the company  solved the problem. To  insure that the women  would have enough healthy  True    False    7.  True    False    8.  eggs to produce children  the company set up a frozen "egg bank". Women  wanting to work in this  area of the factory are  now required to "deposit"  eggs in the egg bank before being given a job.  The eggs can then be thawed, fertilized, and implanted in the woman's  womb should she decide to  become pregnant at some  later date.  Betsy makes a living selling her own eggs. She is  able to command a very  high price for them having been judged a genetically superior female  based on the following  characteristics; the  length of her legs in relation to her body size,  a low fat to muscle ratio  and truly outstanding  mammeries. Although she  is a mother 50 times over  she has never once been  pregnant.  Pergonal, the fertility  drug used to hyperstimu-  late egg production for  the process of "egg harvesting" (removing eggs  from a woman's body to  fertilize them outside  the womb) comes from the  i"$* ci' urine of menopausal nuns  living in Italy.  True    False    9. Jim, a millionaire from  Texas, had one of his  cells cloned (induced to  divide and form an embryo)  and inserted into the womb  of an African woman. Nine  months later she produced  the first "cloned" infant,  an exact replica of Jim.  True    False  10. After carefully studying  the Amazon Molly, a small  tropical fish that reproduces without males, Dr.  Sappho Q. Scientist developed a procedure through  which human females can  breed without males. Testing the procedure on herself., she has produced the  first "parthenogenetic"  child, a daughter identical to herself.  True False 11. Janice, after having ul-  S&^.vi'- trasound, finds that the  infant she is carrying  has no left arm from the  elbow down. Feeling that  she can not cope with  !fe;Pl*S having a "deformed"-child  she has the fetus aborted.  True    False  12. Stanley "The Crusher" and  Irma "Maiden of Death"  have retired from their  lucrative careers in the  all-star wrestling circuit  to settle down and have a  family. Together, they  hope to produce the world's  greatest all-star wrestler.  Despite their obviously  superior genetic material  they leave nothing to fate.  When Irma becomes pregnant  they hire an expert in recombinant DNA research to  insert the growth hormone  gene of a gorilla into the  —i      True  False  appropriate chromosome of  their future champion.  This insures an abnormally large, muscular offspring. They name the  child King Kong.  ANSWERS: l.T (Shelley is a surrogate  mother) 2.T 3.F 4.T 5.T 6.F (but  technically possible) 7.T (but Betsy is  a Holstein cow, although there is a firm  in Chicago buying women's eggs) 8.T 9.F  10.F 11.T 12.F (although now possible  between mice and rats)  There is only one scenario above that is  truly outlandish. Dr. Sappho Q. Scientist  does not exist, although the Amazon Molly  does. While parthenogenesis (reproduction  without sperm) occurs as a natural mode  of reproduction in several species of  animals, it has never received the attention—not to mention the funding—of  cloning or "in vitro" (test-tube) studies . Which brings us to the issue of  choice.  The proponents of biotechnology mollify  women by using one of our favorite feminist words: choice. They tell us they  are giving women more reproductive choices. What could be more noble? Isn't  that what we've been fighting for all  these years? But while claiming to provide us with unlimited choice they have  neglected to address some fundamental  contradictions.  Why is a single woman denied access to  sperm when a single man can not only  purchase an egg, but can rent a woman's  body for a period of nine months within  which in incubate that egg? With prenatal sex determination do we really have  free choice in determining the sex of  our children? Don't we live in a world  that values males above all other  things? And what a-bout the choice to  raise a disabled child given the lack  of support systems our communities provide? And finally, will sperm and egg  banks be giving us more workplace choice  or two simple alternatives: that of  working with toxic materials or not  working at all?  Biotechnology does not deal with ethics  nor, like any science, is it concerned  primarily with the needs of its experimental subjects whether they be rats,  cows or women. To control our reproductive destinies we must begin making  informed choices around the development  and use of these techniques. We must  understand how they work, and also decide whether they can serve our needs  and provide us with the choices that we  define as important. Ultimately, we must  create the choices by controlling the  technology of reproduction.  With this idea in mind I will be looking  at the current state of biotechnology in  the next few issues of Kinesis.

But what I do know  is that if we don't start making the  choices soon, the boys in the lab will  have made them for us. . 14   Kinesis March 1986  by Phyllis and Miche  Representatives of the Olympia Washington Big Mountain support group were  in Vancouver for a week in January to  raise awareness about the forced relocation of over 14,000 Hopi and Navajo people from Big Mountain and the  Joint Use Area (JUA). The Hopi and the  Navajo are the two most culturally  intact tribes left in the U.S. They  have shared the land in what is now  called the JUA for hundreds of years  without conflict. The 14,000 people  to be relocated represent a large percentage of the traditional people that  are left. Their legends and prophesies  tell them they are born of that very  place, and they are to protect the  earth as their mother. They maintain  ceremonies which may only be performed in certain locations, at certain  times. The people understand that Big  Mountain is a holy place, and that it  has an essential role in maintaining  the forces and energies in North America. For these reasons the people  are willing to defend the land with  their lives.  In the early 1900's tremendous reserves of untapped oil, natural gas,  ground water resources, and uranium  were discovered in the JUA. That is  where the problems started.  As early as 1921 the Standard Oil  Company proposed an oil leasing deal  which the Navajo elders rejected by a  vote of 75-0.  In 1955, after years of continued  Navajo rejection of mineral exploration  the American government succeeded in  replacing the traditional Navajo leadership with a puppet tribal council  which began granting extensive mineral  rights to multinationals. Among these  corporations the Peabody Coal Company  alone has strip-mined 58,000 acres  of the Black Mesa.  We talked to Marilyn James, a Colville  tribal member from the Okanogan and  Chesaw bands about the history of the  struggle and the resistance.  We have been led to believe that there  is a dispute between the Hopi and the  Navajo people. How true is this?  "The dispute is between the progessives  (the American government appointed  tribal council) and the traditionals.  The progressives and the government  are trying to divide the JUA between  the Hopi and the Navajo so that the  multinationals can come in and extract  the very rich natural resources in the  area. The myth is that there is a dispute between the two tribes when in  fact the American government only  recognizes the progressive factions of  both tribes. Less than 15% of the  people voted for the current tribal  leadership because they don't believe  in that form of government. The people  do not recognize it."  In 1971 there was a renewed push for  50-50 surface partition of the JUA.  Who  was behind this and how did they go  about it?  "The puppet Hopi tribal council hired  a public relations firm from Salt Lake  City, Utah, Evans and Associates, to  stage a 'range war"1 between the Hopi  and the Navajo. This firm brought in  the media and hammed it up about how  the Indidans were 'fighting among themselves.' The. ^council then applied to  the government to provide a 'humanitarian solution' to this conflict.  The American government was happy to  'save the Indians from themselves' and  passed the 1974 Navajo Hopi Land Settlement Act (Ph 93-531). It mandates that  the JUA be partitioned and says that  Indians found on the 'wrong side of the  fence' will be forceably relocated. Under  Ph 93-531 some 2.2 million acres will be  redistributed.  This law was never really brought to the  people. It does not recognize the tra-  ditonal leadership and is based on fraud  and cultural genocide. The traditional  people have repeatedly gone to the American government and tried to have the  law repealed.  What effect has this law had on the  people who are supposed to relocate?  The Navajo people who live a very  isolated existance are almost totally  self-sufficient. They are basically "  shepherds and so need a large land  base for grazing. Much of the land on  . the Navajo reservation is pretty well  taken up so they have to be relocated  to hostile border towns like Flagstaff or into what I call 'reservation  ghettos.1 They are big housing projects which don't have sufficient land  or water supplies for sheep or gar-  The Navajo have never had sewage  bills, tax payments, rent bills etc.,  so when they move they have to use  an economic system that is foreign  to them.        W&mmenttfMi  Out of the 3,300 Navajo people already relocated, 60 % have lost  everything. Although it is illegal  many of these people want to go  back to the reservation. Many return  but go underground to live with their  families, which creates an almost  graphic from Big Mountain News  unbearable burden. Also under the  law they have a life estate program  for the older people. What this  program says is that the elders can  stay on the land until they die.  But, what the government does is  relocate their support system, so  the elders are left to do all the  work themselves. What the government is really saying is, 'we'll  let you stay until you die but  we'll put you into an early grave.  The law attacks from many, many sides.  Why were herd reduction measures included in the law?  The Hopi progressives said the Navajo  were over grazing the land. So they  cut the herds by 90%. Since Mutton  is their main food source it's one  more way of starving them off the  land.  While not one acre has ever been reclaimed from the strip mining in the  area, over-grazing is blamed for he  devastation of the land.  What kind of effect is this all having  on the environment?  While not one acre has ever been  reclaimed from strip mining,  over-grazing is blamed  for the devastation.  The desert plateau area is basically  being destroyed. There is a coal slurry  line which runs from the Black Mesa to  Nevada, a distance of 286 miles. They  are pumping water out of the aquifer (a  water bearing stratum of permeable rock,  sand or gravel) at a rate of three  million gallons a day, which is faster  than it can replenish itself. The high  desert plateau area is a delicate balance  of underground water and precipitation  and if the water level drops too low it  will endanger all life.  There are 49 uranium mines on the Navajo  reservation. Uranium is only found in  water-bearing geological layers and they  are pumping the water out of the mines,  freely into the desert. This water is  radioactive. It doesn't just evaporate,  it seeps back down into the water tables,  so they are contaminating the aquifer,  which is one of the major aquifers on this  continent.  Then there is the pollution from radioactive gases and the tailing dumps.  Many elders are watching the sheep that  are left to them get sick, go blind, and  die. They are afraid to eat the meat because they think it might be contaminated.  It seems crucial that people become.  The Native people are crying out for  support for this problem. Because,  Big Mountain continued page 28 Vf arch 1986  INTERNATIONAL  World Information Order  Western media sets world news agenda  by Emma Kivisild  Homework for the concerned reader.  Take your daily paper, and, over the  period of a week, clip all the articles about the Third World. Now'  look at the bi-lines (where they tell  you who wrote the article)." How  many just read AP, UPI, Reuter? How  many are written by Canadian, American,  British correspondents? How many of  the writers are actually from  the  country they are writing about?  Next, look at the content. Which of  the following accurately describes  the focus of the story? Major natural  disaster; hopelessly complicated and  volatile political situation; overpopulation; Soviet/Marxist threat;  famine (and hence agricultural and  economic incompetence).  Virtually all the information the  mainstream media gives us about the  Third World comes from Western correspondents. Most of it exaggerates  violence and instability in the Third  World, by not mentioning anything else.  At the same time, we get very little  in the way of analysis or historical  perspective, and the very vocabulary  used in international reporting is  distorting and misleading.  As Anthony Smith askes in The Geopolitics of Information,   "When does a  government become merely a 'regime,'  and by what criteria may it earn reclassification by Western journalists?"  It is via these same articles, radio  pieces, and TV spots, that Third World  people learn about themselves and each  other. In 1980, four news agencies—  Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, and Agence France-  presse—supplied ninety percent of all  the news reported in the world.  The  following is extremely common: a reporter is assigned to one region, say,  Africa, s/he travels to a country for  the first time, puts together a story  in a few days, and then sends it back to  Washington, New York, London, or Paris  for editing. The story is then sent back  to that African nation to be broadcast!  At the time of the struggle for the  independence of Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia),  one British reporter covered the situation for three London dailies by simply using different pseudonyms.  Third World media, controlled as it is  from outside, carries very little that  is actually about the Third World. While  citizens may be able to get (biased) news  about their own coutnry, it is almost  certain that they will hear nothing  about other Third World nations. And as  indigenous values and traditions are  trivialized or ignored, the people are  inundated with information from and  about the West. They operate in what  many have called a 'spiritual vacuum,'  and become increasingly dependent on  First World news and entertainment.  Needless to say, coverage of Third  World women suffers as well. They are  confined to a few prescribed roles:  wives of prominent leaders; mothers  (how many pictures of anonymous women  with children!); sources of cheap  labour; and exotic beauties. We do not  hear about feminist organizing in the  Third World, about other political  activities of Third World women, or  about their everyday working lives.  The images Third World women get of  Western women are hardly any better.  As any Canadian feminist is aware,   women are consistently presented in a  sexist fashion in the mainstream media.  Noga Gayle, professor of a Sociology of  Media course at North Vancouver's Capilano College, says it is the advertising images of Western women that are  particularly debilitating for Third  World women. White women are presented  as an ideal of beauty, launching an industry of bleaching creams and hair  straighteners, and devastating self-  esteem. Local products are seen as  inferior, success wears a white skin.  Nestle's, for instance, went into the  Third World with a media campaign that  insisted that all happy, fat, successful, white, Western babies were reared  on their formula. The result was that  millions of Third World women stopped  breast feeding, and millions of Third*  World children died of malnutrition.  The media is a major international  industry as well. News gathering about  Third World nations is generating  skilled jobs and a lot of money, but  not for Third World people.  What to do? In the 1970's, Third  World nations focussed some of their  resistance to imperialism on two documents eventually passed in part by  the United Nations. In 1974, the UN  proclaimed a New International Economic  Order (NIEO), declaring that the Third  World was determined to close the  widening economic gap between the industrialized and non-industrialized sectors of the globe. And they would do so  on their own terms.  The writers of the NIEO outlined the  roots of this economic disparity, and  developed their analysis of Third  World exploitation as structural in  Western culture. "The media have even  conditioned public opinion in the developed countries to such an extent,  wrote Mustapha Masmoudi of Tunisia,  "as to render it allergic to all claims  and demands' emanating from the Third  World."  Another important document, the New  International Information Order  (NIIO) outlined demand to concretize  this cultural confrontation, and in  1976, ministers of information from  the non-aligned nations met in New  Delhi and adopted the NIIO's call for  urgent reforms in the area of information. Some of these demands are:  •training of Third World journalists  and technicians.  •curtailment of transnational monopolies in the Third World which provide for regional and local interchange of information and expertise.  •Third World tax policies which help  creative writers and artists  •verification by journalists of the  reliability and authenticity of all  material, data, or arguments 'which  might intensify the arms race'.  •"journalists respect the laws of the  country and the cultural values of  . different peoples and acknowledge  that the right of peoples to make  known their own concerns and to learn  about those of other peoples is as  important as respect for individuals."  •journalists inform themselves about the  the country they are reporting on, so  as to 'not see merely the sensational or anecdotal aspect of events.'  •international support for research  into transferring technology from  North to South.  •a tax collected by all developed  economies which export cultural works,  the proceeds to go to an international  copyright fund.  •development of new technologies to  stop satellites sending signals beyond  national boundaries.  The order also delineates a more equitable distribution of the electro-magnetic  spectrum (for radio and TV), and the  lowering of telecommunications tariffs ,  that now make it expensive for developing countries to broadcast to developed  ones.  In November 1978, the UNESCO General  Conference adopted the Declaration on  the Mass Media,   the first step towards  actually implementing it.  Not surprisingly, Western media and  governments have been resistant to the  NIIO. One of the key elements of the  debate has been the issue of the 'free'  press. The NIIO is based on the premise  that information is not neutral, and  needs to be regulated. Western society  holds fast to the doctrine of a free  press, no matter how often the existing  one is exposed as an establishment with  definite political alliances. The NIIO,  for instance, calls into question  the right of French, English and  American reporters to say whatever they  want about the Third World. Those who  criticize it on this basis are rarely  as open to acknowledging the enormous  financial, technical, and political  obstacles that prevent Third World  people from reaching the same audience  with whatever they have to say about  France, England, the US or themselves.  There are other criticisms of. the NIIO.  While it is undoubtedly a rallying ■  point for a critique of cultural imperialism, it is also an un-wieldy bureaucratic document. The myth of objective  reporting is outlined as an ideal to be  attained by Third World journalists.  Women's issues are not well addressed.  Implementing the NIIO is a key step in  challenging the power and propoganda of  the mainstream media, but the UN is no  closer to implementing either the Economic or Information orders than it was  in 1978. The withdrawal from UNESCO of  the United States and Britain weakens  that agency's clout. A truer picture of  the Third World is still very far away. 1*6 Kinesis March 1986  CATO MANOR,  DURBAN, JUNE 1959:  Women protesting  against apartheid were  attacked by police with  batons, police often  hit the babies strapped  to women's backs.  ■m  m  n-'V  APARTHEID:Afrikaans word meaning 'separate development'  The Republic of South Africa is situated at the Southern tip of the African  continent and covers approximately  472,359 square miles.  White rule in South Africa began as  early as 1600 when a Dutch East India  Company established a food and fuel  station on the Cape. African people,  known as the Sans (bushmen) and the  Khoi-Khoi (farmers) had inhabited the  land since 8,000 B.C.  The Anglo-Boer War of 1849-1902 firmly established white English-speaking British rule in what is now  South Africa.  As a result of the war the Act  of Union was passed in 1910 and  South Africa was divided into 4  olonies: Cape Brovince, Natal,  Orange Free State and the Transvaal.  In addition, South Africa's government maintains control over Namibia.  From 1910 the white minority governed  by following a policy of racial  segregation.  In 1912 the African National Congress  (ANC) was formed to protest against  passes and land losses, and to press  for better treatment of Africans.  Legislative repression of South  . African blacks truly began with  the 1913 Land Act which banned  blacks from purchasing land in most  of the country. This left thousands  of blacks landless and forced them  to move onto the government controlled  reserves (called bantustans or  "homelands" by the South African  government).  In 1948, with the election of the  white National Party, apartheid—  or separate development—became  the official state policy of South  Africa.  ly Britain and the Netherlands,  b) "coloureds"—people of South  African and white parentage, c) "Asian"  who are descendents of immigrants  from Asia (mostly India, Pakistan,  Sri Lanka and China) and the Bantus,  or "Blacks", who are further divided  into several different African  tribal groups. These groups are not  allowed to interact and their social  rights, privileges and amenities  are disbursed according to the  white authorities.  The system of racial classification  is all-important in South Africa  since the rights and freedoms of all  people are determined according to  the racial group in which they are  segregated.  Under the Population Registration  Act of 1950 every person over 16  years of age must carry a racial  identity ckrd  that must be produced  on request. The Bantu Act of 1952  provides that every African must  carry a reference book. This system—  known as the pass laws—is the key  to the administration of apartheid  and labour control.  Segregation of the races is carried out  by dividing the country into a white  (European) area (comprising 87 percent  of the land surface of South Africa)  and so-called African reserves (comprising the remaining 13 percent of the  land surface).  The original peoples of South Africa  have struggled against apartheid for  decades.  In 1952, the African National Congress  and the Indian Congress launched the  Defiance Campaign and declared June 26  South Africa Freedom Day. More than  9,000 'defiers' were imprisoned for  peaceful opposition to apartheid.  The South African government divided  the population of South Africa into  four racial groups: a) "whites"—  mostly descendents and immigrants  from European countries, particular-  WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST APARTHEID  In 1955 several liberation groups  including the "ANC, Indian Congress  and Congress of Democrats held meetings  throughout the country and developed  the Freedom Charter which was adopted  by the Congress of the People.  In 1955 South African government ruled  that the pass laws be extended to include women.  From October of 1955 to August of 1956  women, organized by the Federation of  South African women, protested against  the extension.  On August 9, 1956 over 20,000 women  gathered in Pretoria, South Africa's  capital, to demand the law be repealdd.  August 9 has since been declared 'Women's  Day'.  In 1960 a state of emergency was declared.  On March 21, 69 peaceful demonstrators  were killed by police in Sharpville,  Transvaal. In protest, a one-day nation  wide strike was organized, during which  thousands of Africans burnt their passes.  The government arrested over 20,000  people and banned the ANC and the Pan  Africanist Congress (PAC). Both organizations went underground and for the  first time, endorsed the use of violent tactics against the white government .  On June 16, 1976, school children in the  Black township of Soweto refused to  attend classes and took to the streets to  protest the decision of the apartheid  regime to introduce the language of  white South Africans—as a medium of  instruction in their schools. About 1,000  children were killed and thousands more  were maimed during the uprising.  The current uprisings in South Africa most  directly stem from the government's  attempt to introduce constitutional amendments that they said were intended to providi  electoral representation for all South  Africans. The vast majority of South  Africans denounced the amendments as a  facade which would keep white power dominant. Led by the banned ANC South Africans  boycotted the elections.  African National Congress - Women's League  (ANC-WL)  The ANC was established in 1912 to protest  against passes and land loss for Africans.  The Women's League was formed in 1919  and is now known as the Women's Section.  In 1950, the ANC was joined by Coloureds,  Indians and Whites.  In 1960 the ANC was banned and the movement moved underground. In 1961 the ANC  announced the formation of Umkhonto We  Sizwe, its military section and declared  they would meet any police violence with  revolutionary action. ,  Federation of South African Women (FSAW)  Formed in 1954 by women in the ANC-WC and  other women's organizations and trade  unions. In 1955 FSAW adopted the Women's  Charter which is now incorporated into  the Freedom Charter. The FSAW has faced  severe restrictions since the banning of  the ANC.  Black Women's Federation (BWF)  Established in 1975, the BWF member  ship consists of over 41 organizations  united in rejection of Bantu Education and in support of the Soweto  student protests. The BWF was banned  in Oct.'77.

We wouldn't  be where we are today—politically—  if it hadn't been for these foreign  companies. The role they are playing  is simply to defuse a militant situation. If you give a man a salary  comparable to that of his white  counterpart, and he goes back to the  ghetto where he has no rights and remains a 'Bantu' and must carry that  document of oppression-, that dompass,  you are only defusing and demoralizing him into believing that his  situation is normal, because you  claim that his work situation is  normal.

She can only r.  person at a time, is banned from public meetings and schools,  not travel without permission and contact with her husband  (Nelson Mandela) is severly limited.  She was banished to the remote conservative town ofBrandfort  in Orange Free State in 1977, but. returned to Soweto after her  Brandfort home was firebombed in December.  Since December she has defied all government imposed restrictions and has refused to return to Brandfort.  Mrs. Mandela's name and stature have forced even some of  the most apathetic to realize what is behind the reality of bannings,  detentions and political imprisonments. Her imposing stature  has served to make visible the statureless nobodies who are victims  of these political evils somewhere in an unknown police cell o r  remote bundu, people who have a story to tell but with nobody  who cares to carry it. Through the story of her own life we are  able to read the story of many others.  She is a window through which even the most uninitiated eye  is introduced to the obscure, twilight existence of the banned  and detained. Through her the invisible were made visible. She  was the type of a personality whom the press and other publicity  media could not afford to forget even in her many years of statutory  silence and non-existence.

Restricted to Johannesburg.  1963 Arrested for attending a gathering; found not guilty and  acquitted.  1965 A more stringent banning order for five years and restriction to Orlando township. As a result she lost her job  with the Child Welfare Society.  1966 Additional restrictions imposed, prohibiting her from  'preparing>compiling, publishing, printing or transmitting  any document, book, pamphlet, record, poster, photograph', etc. etc. Accused of violating regulations for visit  to Robben Island — instead of going by train she had  gone by plane to get there before her permit expired.  1967 Accused of resisting arrest, during a scuffle a policeman  broke his neck (it was not fatal); she was found not guilty  and was acquitted.  Accused of violating her banning order: failed to give  her name and address to the Security Police in Cape  Town. Sentence: twelve months' imprisonment suspended for three years; she spent four days in prison.  1969 Detained (with twenty-one others) under the Suppression  of Communism Act and accused of having promoted the  aims of the banned A N C As a result she lost her job.

I have ceased a long time ago to exist as an individual. The  ideals, the political goals that I stand for, those are the ideals and  goals of the people in this country. They cannot just forget their  own ideals. My private self doesn't exist. Whatever they do to  me, they do to the people in this country. I am and will always be  only a political barometer. From every situation I have found  myself in, you can read the political heat in the country at a  particular time. When they send me into exile, it's not me as an  individual they are sending. They think that with me they can  also ban the political ideas. But that is a historical impossibility.  They will never succeed in doing-that. I am of no importance to  an individual. What I stand for is what they want to  banish. I couldn't think of a greater honour.

ANC Women  One of the clauses of the Freedom  Chafer ±s  that people shall share in  the country's wealth and then -it specifies that banks and monopoly industries  must be nationalised.  It isn't a socialist programme—saying  that the working class will take control of the means of production—but  it envisages a kind of people's democracy in which the state ensures that  the welfare of the people is catered  for in the economic structure of the  country.  Our strategy and tactics document goes  a bit further because it looks at the  experiences of countries that have  attained liberation but where this  hasn't really changed people's conditions of life very much.  We are very much conscious that we want  a much more far-going transformation  of our society. We have said that we  feel the best way to guarantee that  happening is for the working class to  play a leading role in the liberation  alliance. The ANC has of course had a  very long alliance with SACTU (the  South African Congress of Trade Unions)  and the South African Communist Party.  Usually the standard Western propaganda  against the ANC is that we are armed  by the socialist countries and we've  never denied that. We've said we will  take arms, we welcome them.  The ANC has specifically said that at  the moment we see no prospect of any  kind of negotiated settlement because  certain conditions are not there.  We're committed to the Freedom Charter,  and to a single, unitary South Africa  with complete democracy.  Women in the struggle  for freedom  The Women's Section of the ANC has  taken a lot of initiatives to help  the movement. It always responds to  the conditions in which South Africans  find themselves.  For example when thousands of Africans  had to flee the country, we were left  with the problem of homes for them to  belong to, thus being dependent only on  their young mothers, sometimes getting  help from their equally young fathers.  While male chauvinism is universal,  colonialism and the exploitation of  males and females by white settlers  has made sexism worse among African  men in South Africa. One thing that  intensified the inequality was the  employment conditions: men found that  they were better paid than women,  which made them better equipped than  women for living the life of struggle  and survival.  As the suppression intensified women  found that they were being forced to  participate directly in the struggle  whether or not they have the economic  means to do so. In fact only when  women participated was our success  assured.  The oppression has opened the minds  of our men; they have come to realise  that women are doing things, with or  without them. That has helped them  to see how much more powerful women  are. When men took part in defiance  struggles, women gave them material  and moral support.  Our equality with men in inbuilt in  the charter of Freedom and there is  no way we are going back to the kitchens as in cases where women were put  down after independence.  The other additional factor for our  confidence is that the women are  being provoked where it hurts them  most. In the latest uprisings for  example children are the ones bearing  the brunt, and mothers are the closest  to respond to that. The women of South  Africa are becoming more and more militant as a result.  Young women who are married and are  carrying children are not immobilised  by their children. They have worked out  a system of combining the struggle with  their lives. The mothers know that the  milk and the cereals produced in the  country is not for them. That is why *  we send out appeals from time to time  for milk and cereals.  The whole production at the expense of  the African dignity; labour is geared  towards export, and at the most feeding  the white minority in the country. The  women know that, and they fight back  from that knowledge. Their position  within the resistance is based on  that knowledge and bitter experience.  So they are not going to give up their  rights that easily.  The women who resist come from the garment factories which exploit their wage  labour; they come from the grape  growing areas where women are given  grape vines and food instead of wages;  from the wine factories were children  are employed and are paid in wines, so  that they turn alcoholics.  Women also know that they are no longer  a cattle herding people, as the whites  have taken it all, and the South Africans now do not own cattle and do not  drink milk. Nor are they allowed on  their lands where they can grow cereals  to feed themselves.  The whole social fabric has been destroyed, and women know that. They feel  it most and they are the ones who are  in the vanguard of ascertaining the survival of the Africans in the country.  Organizing  The level of organisation and mobilisation in urban areas is much stronger  than in rural areas but because of the  government's policy of forced removals,  influx control and so on, you find  people from the urban areas are dumped  in some of the rural areas.  Often there might be resistance taking  place in the rural areas that never  reaches the light of day. Because it's  isolated, it's more difficult for "those  people to link up with the national  movement.  People in rural areas—and increasingly they are using female labour—are  notoriously difficult to organise. The  difficulty is to get a place where one  can meet them. It is one of our priorities that women in the bantustans and  the white-owned farming areas, are organised into trade unions and so, therefore, into the ANC (not the ANC as such,  but into mobilisation and organised  resistance).  For a lot of women who are dumped in  the bantustans and so on, their  resistance is to leave those areas and  come and squat in the squatter camps  around the cities. They fight and  keep on coming back no matter how many  times they are removed.  We've called on people not just to  destroy the puppet councils in their  communities but to set up people's  committees, street committees etc.,  to start the embryos of people's power.  Our main challenge at the moment is  to strengthen our underground organisation. There is massive popular  support for the ANC but we have to  have those people organised so that  they can act cohesively to start  shifting the balance—where casualties are not so largely on our side  and too few on the side of the enemy.  One also has to remember that even  though Southern African countries are  for us to a large degree, South Africa  has the power, both economically and  militarily, to call the shots in  Southern Africa.  Also, there is the special character  of S.A. You've got almost two  nations—one colonised, the other  colonising—within the boundary of  one country. The colonising nation  has got very strong resources and is  seen by imperialism as its agent in  the region.  If the West cut off financial,  military and economic assistance to  the apartheid regime, they would  never have survived as long as they  have. Their combined forces make an  enemy of unusual strength.  Support for South African Women  We need political support in the  sense that people should understand  (and particularly we would hope  to reach the women's movement here)  the specific kind of oppression  that women in S.A. experience and  the nature of their incredibly  brave struggle under conditions  like the so-called population control  programme.  We would like women in this country  to campaign around and demand the unconditional release of, women political prisoners and detainees, who  are often sexually assaulted. Political prisoners aren't allowed any  study material, regular visits or  letters.  Also, if you are in a women's section of a trade union you can push  through motions that your union  will encourage and support people  who boycott S.A. goods or refuse to  handle them.  You can help..  •Initiate and/or support disinvestment  actions at your municipal council,  school board, university or other  public bodies. Taxpayers' monies should  not be used to indirectly subsidize  apartheid.  •If you are a member of a trade union,  a pensioners' group, community group  or other organization, urge a review  of current investment and banking practices.  •Boycott all South African products.  •Forward resolutions and/or write personal letters to Prime Minister Mulroney or External Affairs Minister  Joe Clark (c/o Parliament Bldgs., Ottawa—postage free) demanding that Canada  impose mandatory economic sanctions  on South Africa.  •Support and join your local Anti-  Apartheid Group, or where none is available, help to start a local one. INTERNATIONAL  INTERNATIONAL  News  International Women's Day March in Kingstown, St. Vincent, March 8,1985.  Caribbean  women  on the  move  Caribbean women are on the  move organizing to fight for  jobs, healthcare, education,  legal protection, freedom  from sexual violence, and  political rights. They see  their problems as linked to  the forces which keep the  majority of people in their  countries poor and powerless,  and women the poorest and  most powerless of all-. Thus  while they fight for changes j  which will specifically  benefit women, they see this  work as part of a larger  struggle which they share  with men for economic, cultural, and political self-  determination for their  nations.  Women's unemployment in the  Caribbean reaches as high as  40%, and higher in the rural  areas. Among employed women  some 70% have low paid service  jobs and many are domestic  servants. Employment options  for women are limited by  generally high levels of joblessness in their countries,  by historical ghettoization  of women in service and  clerical occupations, and by  sex discrimination in hiring  and job training.  Many Caribbean women are  farmers but their opportunities are restricted because  good farm land is scarce and  often monopolized by large  private estates or commercial  plantations. Back-breaking  labour in sugar cane or  banana fields brings women  agricultural labourers as  little as $4.50 (Canadian)  a day. Many women farmers  sell their produce in town  markets, while some market  local food-stuffs between  islands. Women traders con.-  trol approximately 70% of  local food products.  Recently U.S. multinational  "corporations have begun  employing women in electronics , garment, and  sporting goods assembly  plants, and for computer  data entry. With high unem  ployment, they pay the  workers as little as one-  tenth the American wage rate  with few or no benefits.  Increasingly active in trade  unions, women are pressing  for higher minimum wage  rates, for improved benefits  including paid maternity  leave, for access to jobs  previously reserved for men,  and for their right to join  and participate equally  in unions. They and other  women are also pushing for  legislation to end wage  discrimination, for job  training and, most importantly, for economic programs  to create more jobs for women.  Women are also creating their  own employment, starting  small businesses or forming  cooperatives. In Grenada, the  eighteen women of She Grqjjr  fruit co-op dry local fruit  for cakes to replace expensive imports. In Dominica  the "Banana Bunch" make  chips from discarded green  bananas. Another Grenadian  co-op has pioneered non-traditional jobs for women  in woodworking.  Spanish  feminists  break  abortion  law  Was it a stunt or not? That's  the question that men like  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez,  and the Minister of Justice,  Fernando Ledesma are asking  themselves. Nearly 3,000 feminists have confessed to  breaking Spain's new abortion  law by aborting two pregnancies, then displaying the  fetuses in bottles.  The women were protesting  a law that says abortions  will be permitted only in  the case of rape, danger to  the mother's life, or severe  physical disability of the  fetus. They were also protesting that many of Spain's  doctors are refusing to perform abortions due to  threats of murder suits. Already four doctors are being  sued, and there were only  20 abortions performed in  the country in the first three  months under the new legislation. Previously all abor  tions were illegal. The suits  against the doctors were  begun by the Catholic church.  Spain's National Council of  Bishops has declared that  anyone who co-operates physically or morally in an abor- ,  tion is automatically excommunicated from the Roman  Catholic Church.  In Barcelona a convention,  attended by 3,000 women, was  held to strategize on the  repressive abortion law.  Meeting leaders announced  that during the convention  medical technicians had performed abortions on two  women, neither abortion  fitted the law's criteria. The  3,000 women at the meeting  signed confessions to having  assisted in the abortions.  Spain's justice minister says  that only the two women who  had been pregnant, and the  people who performed the  abortions can be charged, but  admits he is uncertain if any"  abortion actually took place.  He cannot believe any woman  would allow an aborted fetus  that was formerly hers to be  flaunted in such a manner,  even for the sake of embaras-  sing the law.  Many Spaniards think the abortions were a hoax, but police  have reported that the fetuses  were real.  The law the women are protesting has only been in effect  for a few months. The 1983  socialist government of Felipe  Gonzales had passed a more liberal abortion law, but in  never went into effect since  in 1985, Spain's Constitutional Court ruled that the reform  violated the constitution  which says: "All have the right  to life."  During the summer of 1985, the  parliament passed a more restrictive law. It was predicted  there would be a rush of women  to the operating tables. Some  said 25,000 women were awaiting  abortions, but the reality was  that the services were not  there. Doctors, hospital staff,  the church, and tradition held  women in positions of helplessness. The Health Ministry  was asking for doctors to  register as conscientious  objectors, but Spain's  National Medical Association  put an end to that, not only  because it particularly  approves of abortion, but  to protect those of its  members who are willing to  do abortions.  Ifrom  the  Japan's  first  Rape  CrisisCentre  Being the first Rape Crisis  Centre in Japan isn't easy.  There's .no-one to turn to  for advice, and no role models for the most effective  way to operate alongside  the Japanese culture.  The originators of the  Tokyo Rape Crisis Centre  ' were two women who comprised  the Lesbian Feminist Centre.  For years they had been concerned about the growing pornography industry in Japan,  and after showing a collection of slides from the US  on the subject, the script  for which they translated  into Japanese, they felt  they could no longer bear  to be inactive.  They started the centre to  provide a much needed service  and raise public consciousness about women's position  in society.  In 1982 they began researching rape statistics,  attending trials, and  considering the problems  that would be inherent in  setting up such a centre.  One of the biggest problems was money. No government grants are available  for feminist groups, and  Japan does not have a history of handouts from charitable foundations, so the  initial financing came  from the women themselves,  who made loans to the  centre.  A centrally situated office  where they could answer calls  was also a high priority  need. In western Rape Crisis  Centres answering machines  are used which give the home  phone number of the Woman  on duty, but in Japan this  system would not work.  Apartments are small, with  doors between rooms made  literally of paper, and few  women have any kind of privacy in their living  arrangements.  And of course there was  the issue of publicity. How  would women know of their  existence, and would they  even understand that the  centre was there to help  around  world  them? The Japanese character  for rape had (and still has)  negative and indecent connotations and had to be  reclaimed to define the experience of women.  On 1 September 1983, the  lines were opened three  nights a week from 7-10  pm. A tiny one room apartment had been found, ironically enough in an area  of central Tokyo infamous  for 'adult entertainment'.  Their number had grown  to five, but for safety  reasons one woman couldn't  be in the centre alone,  which seriously taxed their  limited resources.  As a new venture several  of the national daily newspapers and women's magazines  wanted to interview them,  and stickers were distributed throughout the Tokyo  area, which resulted in  calls coming in almost at  once, from as far apart  as Hokkaido in the North  and Kyushu in the South.  In October of the same  year the first training  course for women interested  in becoming counsellors  started, planned and led  by the same five women who  were answering the calls.  By now they'd built up  a team of advisors, including feminist counsellors,  doctors and lawyers, and  these professional women  contributed to the  training programme..  The relationship between the  Rape Crisis Centre and the  police is non-existent, because of their attitude  regarding violence towards  women. Recently a member  of the centre was passing a  police box outside in which  a woman was being beat up.  A policeman shouted to the  male assailant not to beat  the woman up outside the  police box, but to go and  do it at home.  The Rape Crisis Centre member protested, both at  the police box and the area  police station, where she  was told it was none of  her business, and anyway  the couple were married.  And for a few days she and  another RCC staff member  were followed by plain-  clothed policemen.  Whilst the general atmosphere towards Rape Crisis  Centres is different in  the West and in Japan, the  statistics regarding rape-  place , known or unknown  attacker, frequency, etc.,  seem very similar.  The same myths abound,  whilst the sexual exploitation of women in Japan,  both native and foreign  (particularly those from  South East Asia) is notorious.  At the time of writing,  one year and two months  from the initial opening  of the centre, a total of  352 calls have been received. The third training course is well under  way, and the number of  members has grown to 10.  Despite the hostile  atmoshpere of the surrounding society, the centre  is determined to continue  counselling and campaigning for women's freedom  until no woman has to walk  the streets in fear.

Argentina  Mothers  protest  acquittals  It is dxfficult to put into,  perspective for Canadian readers just why women in Argentina  have to wear the white babushka  that some 30,000 wear in defiance of their government.  Imagine all the youths in a  city the size of New Westminster disappearing. Imagine  that after years of mothers  networking to search for  children government officials  seem to know where and how  the youths have been disposed  of but are absolved of all  guilt. Imagine these youths  were idealists who wanted to  live in a democracy. Imagine  someone took plane loads of  them out over the ocean and  shoved them out without  parachutes.  Recently the trial of nine  members of Argentina's military junta, charged with human  rights abuses during the  'dirty war', ended. Sitting  in the court room were some  mothers of missing children.  Hebe de Bonafini, President  of The Mothers of the Disappeared was there. It was  in large measure because of  the actions of her group  that the men were on trial.  As judgement was being passed  on Galtieri, one of the junta's  chief members, Bonafini donned  the white head scarf which  for eight years has been the  symbol of resistance against  the military authority. Her  reason: Galtieri was found  not guilty.  He was one of four senior  army officers who got off  that day. Bonafini called  the trial a terrible and  tragic fraud perpetrated on  the Argentine people. She  said the evidence presented  by many who. survived torture had been unshakable.  Women in Argentina see the  trial as the outcome of a,  series of compromises the  new civilian government  has made with the military.  Bonafini says: "Before his  election as President, Alfon-  sin promised us everything  but he has done little to  implement those promises.  He has met the mothers only  once in two years. Most of  the judges that were on  the bench during the military regime still remain  on the bench, and have the  power to sit in justice  over their former bosses.  Officers named by torture  survivors as collaborators  are still in power, and some  have even been promoted.  Galtieri was named, as having  been present at torture sessions and approved of them.  President Alfonsin himself  has said: "These mothers  of the missing men are now  outside democracy." Although  Alfonsin would like to present a rosy picture of the  new Argentina to the world  as recently as November there  has been a resumption of the  bombings. And there are  rumours of another coup  plot. The military wants  power again.  "The threat to democracy  comes from the torturers  and murderers who walk the  streets freely," says Bonafini, "and from those in  power who are protecting them.  We won't accept that our  children are dead until  their murderers are brought  to justice. You can't negotiate with the blood of so  many Argentines. The mothers  will never permit that."  This is the battle cry of  women who will not rest  until the last criminal  has been tried and sentenced  appropriately. Who can forget the torture and murder  of 30,000 youths?  Mothers of the Disappeared relate the story of one of the missing people at the end of tl  weekly demonstration.  'Boat brides'  exiled  to live  on water  13,000 women in Hong Kong  are not allowed to set foot  on shore says the British  Government there. A mother  cannot walk her child to  school. A woman cannot go  to the markets. The only  reason they can go ashore  is to visit a clinic if  they are properly ill. These  women, known as the boat  brides, have come from  China, married fishermen,  but are no longer legally  citizens of any country.  It makes them dependent on  their husbands, a position  hazardous to some.  The British want them all  to go back to China, leaving  their homes and families,  and have promised to give  them due consideration if  they apply to return to  Hong Kong legally. A few  women who have risked getting caught ashore have been  deported to China. Groups  campaigning in support of  the boat brides claim the  government is punishing  Boat brides continued next page I  ED-  22   Kinesis March 1986  Boat brides from previous page  the women. Amnesty International is investigating.  For these 13,000 women  paid work ashore is out of  the question. They live  in small boats and although  they are in homes of their  choice, they are still prisoners. If one is due to deliver a baby, an officer of  the law accompanies her to  the clinic, to make certain  she returns to her boat  once the delivery takes  place. Restrictive as that  is, i.t is not the worst  that can happen to boat  wives.  When a family is offered  accomodation on land—the  dream of many boat people—  only the husbands and children can take up abode. The  women must remain on the  boat. In June of 1984, the  government ruled that the  boat brides lose their  right to live in territorial waters the moment'the  husbands choose to live on  land.  The campaign for acceptance  of these women has been  fought for more than ten  years, but the government  is holding firm to its  commitment. In June of 1984  14 women defied the law  and walked ashore. They  were deported to China.

VANCOUVER, BC  V5L2H1 (604)254-5635  Indian  woman  challenges  Muslim law  On June 6, 1985, Sharifabi,  a young divorced woman, went  on a hunger strike at Bindu  Chowk, Kolhapur, to protest  against the Indian Muslim  law which permits verbal  divorce by a man of his  wife.  Sharifabi was married on January 1, 1985, to Harun Rashid,  son of a hardware and cement  merchant of Kolhapur. The  bride's father spent about  Rs 30,000 on the wedding.  Within a month of the wedding,  Rashid asked her to bring a  TV, a fan, an almirah and 25  saris from her natal home.  When she did not fulfil this  demand, Sharifabi was subjected to severe mental harassment by her in-laws.  On March 27, things came to  a head when the in-laws finally divested her of her  jewellery and certain other  personal possessions, and  threw her out of the house.  She had to return to her  father in Bombay. A few  days later, Harun Rashid  divorced her by sending her  a Talaknama  or bill of divorce through the post.  Incensed by this, Sharifabi's  father, Nabisahib Mullah,  took the matter to the  Sunnat Jamat, the local court  of the Muslim community at  Kolhapur. All efforts of the  Jamut to bring about a  .ciliation failed.  Sharifabi next took her case  to the Muslim Satyashodhak  Samaj, a Muslim social reform  body. With the help of this  organisation, Sharifabi  succeeded in obtaining Rs  10,000 in the form of cash  and jewellery as mehr  from  Rashid's family.  But Sharifabi was forced  to sign a statement saying  that she would not press for  maintenance. However,  Sharifabi has now gone to"  court to claim maintenance,  arguing that she signed the  agreement under duress. The  Samaj is supporting her in  this legal action.  As long as Muslim men enjoy  the right unilaterally to  divorce their wives who have  no such corresponding right,  Muslim women will continue  to live in insecurity and  fear. In protest against  this discriminatory law,  Sharifabi went on a day's  hunger strike. Nearly  800 women from nearby Muslim  settlements came to express  solidarity with her.  That evening,. the Muslim  Satyashodhak Samaj took  out a procession through  the streets of Kolhapur,  condemning the practice  CL4RE  SIGNPAINTER  GRAPHIC TECHNICIAN  COMMUNICATING DESIGN  254 • 8892  Attack Alarm'  $10.95 + tax  Keyless Car Alarm  home and apartment  portable remote control units  FOR MORE INFORMATION CALL  ALL-SAFE (255-7233) or  3471 B Kingsway  Vancouver, B.C.

They  also presented a memorandum  to the district level  authorities, outlining their  demands.  On April 23, the supreme  courts delivered a historic  judgment in the case of  Shahbanu versus Mohammed  Ahmed Khan, laying down  that a husband must give  maintenance to his divorced  wife. This judgment has given  Muslim women some confidence.  In order to give concrete  shape to this new feeling,  and to organise Muslim women  around their own issue, the  Samaj is organising a Talak  Muki Morcha which will  tour all the districts of  Maharashtra. The activities  will include public meetings,  discussions with Muslims,  street theatre, poster  displays, slide shows and  representations to every  district magistrate.

The pain goes on and on. Problems include: decreased lactation, increase in menstrual pain  or absence of menses and presumably ovulation, and burning  and itching related to an increase of white discharge in  the vagina and vulva. With infection comes exhaustion and  reduced ability to function.  There is also growing frustration with government.  A team of doctors in the area  have advised women to practise  contraception until the symptoms of the cyanide poisoning  disappear. They say conception  could lead to disabled children.  The Indian government is  reportedly opposed to women  having abortions simply because  they were exposed. Some doctors  say if a mutation appears in  an egg or a sperm cell, this  change can be passed on to future generations. Indian women  are naturally worried and can  obtain few facts about the leak's  impact on fertility and pregnancy.  Indian men want to have sons,  healthy sons. They are not'  willing to take on commitments  with women who cannot produce  sons. Even the men who live in  the exposed area are marrying  women from outside it. Some men  who have marriage commitments are  asking for more money to marry  women from Bhopal.  Last May, after trying many ways  to draw attention to their  problem, hundreds of women marched  in the streets of Bhopal crying:  "Down with police atrocities."  They were protesting the beatings,  by police of women who came to  complain of illness caused by the  Union Carbide leak.  Union Carbide has said it is  investigating any and all claims.  Fifty percent—full equal  representation and not a  seat less—is what New Zealand's feminists want in  their parliament. Members  of the Women's Political  Party met with a member  of the ruling Labour Party  to talk about a private  member's bill to introduce  the legislation. Some of  the women with seats in  government think the idea  has merit, but no one has  jumped at the chance to  draft and present a bill.  Opponents of the idea say  that only the best person  for the job should be  elected. But the Women's  Political Party argues,  if women's right to equal  pay has to be protected  by law, there are precedents  for legislating the representation in parliament  too. New Zealand women have  had the vote for 100 years.  However, there are only 12  women in the parliament, and  only one of those is Maori.  Copies of the Women's Political Party paper outlining  positions can be had from  Box 6606, Wellesley Street,  Aukland, New Zealand.  More  women  'choosing'  sterilization  If the popularity of voluntary  sterilization is any measure  of North American women's faith  in current birth control methods,  than our faith is small indeed.  Recent Canadian and U.S. studies reveal that ever-increasing numbers of women are  choosing tubal ligation over  the pill and other techniques.  In a 1984 Canadian study, 48%  of women surveyed relied on  sterilization—their own or  their partner's—as compared  to 28% who used the pill.  Yet this voluntary termination of fertility (as compared to the involuntary  sterilization of native and  Third World women in North  America) is, for many, merely  the best choice in a field of  poor choices. And the news  from the research front is  not good.  Governments and the pharmaceutical industry are investing less and less in contraceptive research, according to a study published  in International Family  Planning Perspectives. The  same report, which examined  12 countries (including  Canada) and 62 drug companies between 1980-83, also  discovered that Americans  have a high—and misplaced—  expectation that breakthroughs  in birth control are forthcoming. In fact, well over  two-thirds of U.S. manufacturers queried have aban-  donned research and development on such projects. The  major reasons are the prospect of reduced profits from  new or imporved methods,  and the fear of litigation.  Law suits against the makers  of the Dalkon Shield and  the Cu-7, intra-uterine  devices whose use has alled-  edly severely harmed women, have  have scared companies off.  Barrier mdthods of contraception—which pose few health  hazards, are relatively inexpensive and offer protection from sexually transmitted diseases—receive scant  attention from researchers.  Governments share the blame  by failing to provide adequate levels of research  funding. In terms of actual  purchasing power, money  for contraceptive projects  has decreased since the  seventies. The report states  that governments just don't  see the relationship between  increases in abortions and  sterilizations and, overall,  do not regard birth control  as a major health issue.  . Furthermore, feminists'  well-placed distrust of the  industry's record has  translated into little  pressure on governments to  encourage research.  Nuclear  plant  worker  murdered  On September 26, Judith Pen-  ly, a worker at a Tennessee  Valley Authority (TVA)  nuclear plant who had complained about safety violations, was shot to death.  Although Penley was not  killed on the grounds of the  Watts Bar nuclear plant, where  she had been employed, the  local police say Penley's  shooting would fall under  FBI investigation if it- can  be shown to have been an  attempt to tamper with a  federal witness in a safety  case.  The Watts Bar startup date  was postponed by the TVA  Board of Directors when  charges of serious safety  violations proved true. In  August, TVA paid a $100,000  fine for submitting fabricated quality assurance reports to the Nuclear Regu  latory Commission. Startup  date is now set for early  in 1986.  After reports of safety  problems the TVA hired an  outside company, Quality  Technology Company (QTC) to  listen to complaints.  Penley first visited the  QTC on September 1. While  driving home from work on  September 23, she survived  an attack that put 27 bullet  holes in her pick-up truck.  She went again to talk  to the QTC on September 26.  A few hours later she was  dead of two rifle shots to  her head. The county police  believe Penley was slain by  a professional killer.  On that same day, a QTC  employee Mitzie White, was  run off the road as she  drove home. The driver of  the other car was a man in  a ski mask who shouted at  .her: "The- TVA pays you a lot •  of money."  Jerry D. Smith, a senior  nuclear engineer who works  for the TVA, has complained  several times about things  at Watts Bar. Every time he  complains he receives threatening phone calls.  Some say that Penley, who  was only a warehouse worker,  would have .no knowledge  that would make her dangerous enough to be eliminated.  She had worked for TVA's  Sequoyah plant near Chattanooga prior to her employment at Watts Bar. While  she was still at Chattanooga, Penley witnessed the  death of two forklift operators due to what she  told everyone was negligence.  She had developed a reputation for speaking out for  job safety.  TVA is playing down any connection between her testimony  to QTC and her death. QTC  director Scott Schum called  Penley irrational and said  she had no real evidence of  wrong-doing at Watts Bar.  However, there was a rumor  at Watts Bar that Penley  was going to be called before the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission to testify. This  story was broadly circulated just before her death.  Other information points to  an attempt by some other  employees of Watts Bar to  extort money from the TVA  to keep silent about safety  in the plant. Penley could  have known of that attempt.  Allegedly some engineers  have asked for a raise to  $300,000 annually to keep  mum on what they know. There  have been no charges against  the engineers by TVA and  it is not known what salary  the men are now receiving.  There seems to be an implicit message to women  in the nuclear power industry and that message is:  "shut up or die." It  happened to Silkwood and  now it has happened to  Penley. 24   Kinesis March 1986  by Wendy Frost and Michele Valiquette  INTERNATIONAL  International Periodical  The  cornerstone  of  grassroots  feminism  Latin America and the Caribbean  Fern   (Av.

(Carl Sandburg)  Eva Kupczynski took one step to the side  and made a series of tapestries that are,  at first glance, a scaled-down version of  her larger pieces. But upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that what she is  doing is very different indeed from her previous work. She set herself the task of  working on a 'miniature' scale - 6"X6". For  an artist who has made tapestries as large  as 140 sq. feet, this is quite a departure.  It is a credit to her strength as an artist  that the resulting mini-tapestries are rendered so well and communicate as much as  they do. She did not merely reduce a design.  Rather she took the overall size into account  and, indeed, injected a subtle humour into  the work. Instead of depicting an abstracted  design or a small object in a small field,  Kupczynski chose to present an urban panorama  The overall size may be of a small scale  but the content portrays a scenario the size  of the city of Vancouver.  June  is part of a series, now four, soon to  be twelve. (Done initially for an " -,'* 'Ģ--*  exhibition at the Cartwright Gallery,  Vancouver, B.C.), Kupczynski has become  intrigued with the format and decided to  continue with it. June  is not a study for  a larger piece, it is an entity unto itself.  The sense of joy and play that is in evidence through her content (a city panorama)  is also present in her choice of title.  June  speaks not only of the month she is  portraying but also of the artist's  ability to subtly poke fun at herself,  the viewer and art history in general.  The title is seasonal; that is, it talks  about the effect of climate and weather  on any given environment. The irony is  that we tend to think about weather as  it affects a rural, not an urban, setting:  a winter mountainscape, spring flowers,  summer at the lake, etc. Rarely is a city  thought of in terms of how the weather  affects it's structures. More often,  urban areas are discussed in terms of  their event, size of population, political  conflicts, etc.  With June,  Kupczynski has presented a "city-  scape as if it were a natural landscape.  The title then, induces us to make connections between the urban and the rural -  could she be saying that buildings are  the "trees" of cities?  The allusion to natural, evolutionary  geographical forms is furthered by her  division of the piece into three, horizontal sections (strata). Each is different, but share a common image - the building. Yet they are not realistic buildings  with windows and doors, they represent  buildings. Kupczynski has given them shape  and form; even dimension, through use of  perspective. But they are uninhabited. They  stand as structures built by people, without the human presence represented. They  appear untouched, as most landscapes appear  untouched. We are faced with a facade, and  reminded that we are observers.  Each of the three layers relate to the one  before in a 'iftsual way: by the repetition  of rows of buildings. Further, Kupcyzynski  has made connections through her treatment  of the sky in the top layer and the mountains in the bottom layer. Whereas the bases  of the structures share a common plane; the  sky and mountains are molded around the  buildings and the backgrounds appear to be  fluid.  The buildings are vertical, but are laid  out horizontally. This pattern of movement  is practiced in all three parts. As well,  each section gets progressively narrower  as our eyes move upward.  It is interesting to note that the content  follows technique. Kupczynski starts a  tapestry at the bottom and works upwardj  as does June.  As she weaves, the narrative  moves from near water to inner city. The  piece follows a logical sequence in terms  of content and colour just as the overall  series follows a logical sequence from  June  to July  to August,   etc. In other  words, the way in which the artist has  rendered each piece, both individually  and as a series, relates directly to that  about which the pieces communicate.  We are being presented with an emotional,  psychological landscape. The layers within  the tapestry (fibre over fibre) correspond  to the layers of building-above-building;  which in turn,speak of layers of perception. The artist gives us clues to her  intention by using an expressionistic  approach. Buildings are not usually red,  nor blue/green. Neither are they usually  found, side by side, in the same colour  scheme. The nature of cities lies in their  diversity not their homogeneity. That  Kupczynski has chosen to depict buildings  in this manner is an indication of her  perceptions - she has obliterated details  in favour of form. She is showing us her  city. Perhaps somewhat idealistic, it is a  city which works with, not against, the  natural environment. It is a city of grace  and serenity. While not peopled, and  even without doors, it is nonetheless inviting.  The image appears accessible, and it is  in part due to the colour scheme and to  the curved surface of the piece within  it's plexiglas holder. Kupczynski incorporated warm tones and solid areas of red,  blue and blue/green. These evoke feelings  of calm, harmony and fertility. The  colours inject a sense of life into the  otherwise lifeless structures. This is  furthered by a tight weave (a set of 14  threads to the inch) which allows for  uninterrupted colour.  The artist accentuates depth in the tapestry by gently curving it. Striving for  three-dimensionality against a backdrop  of two-dimensionality through her use of  shading, Kupczynski goes one step further.  She physically manipulates the work so  that it is, in actuality, three-dimensional. The curving is not blatant, thus  enhancing the subtleness of the overall  piece.  In June,   Kupczynski has not portrayed the  imposing, as is found in her larger  works. Rather, she has considered the small  size and unleashed its impact. As Louise  Bourgieas has said, "...the relation of  one person to his (sic) surroundings is  a continuing pre-occupation. It can be  casual or close; simple or involved; subtle or blunt. It can be painful or pleas-  and. Most of all it can be real or imaginary."  By juxtaposing a sense of the almost-absurd  with seriousness, of scale with content  and of colour with form, Kupczynski helps  us to question the real and to open up to  the imaginary.

JULIA BRANDRETH (604) 689-8327  PIANO TECHNICIAN  2206 S.W. MARINE DRIVE  VANCOUVER, B.C. V6P 6C2  (604)261-2577 AKIS  Moscow Women: filled with sitences  by Helen Potrebenko  The book Moscow Women  is thirteen interviews by Carola Hansson and Karin Liden  who are Swedish. Threejtranslators are  listed. One hopes something was lost in  the translation.  The main problem with Moscow Women is that  the questions asked are very boring or  just plain stupid, for example: "Do women  and men have the same goal in life?" "What  should the ideal woman be like?" "What is  femininity?" etc. The interviewers criticize the answers, that they are unrealistic or some such thing, ignoring the fact  that if you ask stupid questions, you are  likely to get stupid answers.  Another major problem is that while the  book is called Moscow Women,   in the  author's .chapter introductions and editorial comment, they write as if the  thirteen women living in Moscow are typical of all of Russia or even the Soviet  Union.  For example on page 15 the interviewed  woman is quoted as saying: "Also, because  of the low birthrate, Russia  is wasting  away..." Then on the next page, the inter  -viewer says: "You just said that the  birthrate was low in the Soviet Union."  While there is some information in this  book, it must be kept in mind that it  refers only to Moscow and Moscow has  always had more facilities and more money  than other parts of Russia.  Moscow has about 9-million people. The  population of the Russian Soviet Federal  Socialist Republic is 137,552,000, of  which 21,482,000 are non-Russians in  Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics and  Autonomous Regions, while the population  of the USSR (which is composed of 15 republics including the Russian one) is  262,442,000. So, about Moscow, we learn  the following:  • Day cares are inadequate, understaffed  and poorly run even to the point of  "They yell at the children and use  coarse language." (p. 108)  • Nurseries are said to be even worse  than day cares and only the most desperate mothers put their babies in  nurseries.  • Women get 56 days paid maternity leave  before delivery and 56 days after (4  months). They are allowed another year '  off without pay but few can afford it.  • Some of the women Interviewed complained  of poor maternity care. For just one  example, when the baby starts coming,  the woman walks "to the delivery room.  • Abortion is the only practical method of  birth control. Moscow women have heard  of the pill and IUD but these are considered risky and are not readily avail  -able in any case. Condoms and diaphragms are so poorly made as to be unusable.  • Constant fear of pregnancy was mentioned  as a fact of life. "Abortion is horrible,  and giving birth to any more children is  impossible." (p.105)  • All women work outside the home and do  nearly all the work in the home as well.  This is what is considered to be "emancipation" by the women interviewed (and  by many of us as well). This leads one  woman to say: "But I think when women  were emancipated, it actually amounted  to man's liberation from the family."  (p.25)  • Women are paid less than men but several  of the women remarked on men's low sal  aries as a problem because they are  insufficient to support a wife and child.  • Two salaries are required to get by andy  more than one child is financially im^  possible for most families.  • Drunkenness among men was considered  simply as a fact of life, not something  the women were complaining about in  particular.  • Food lineups are a constant fact of  life. It appears to take as much as  2 hours every day to shop for food.  • Among the most pressing problems is  the acute housing shortage. Most couples live with their parents or in communal apartments. "A happy marriage is  when you love each other and have your  own apartment." (p. 72)  MOSCOW  WOMEN  THIRTEEN      INTERVIEWS      BY  CAROLA  HANSSON  KARIN    LIDEN  WITH        AN        INTRODUCTION BY  GAIL  WARSHOFSKY  LAPIDUS  • The average living space per person is  given by the authors as 12 square meters (that's about 6 feet by 6 feet, I  think). However, one of the women interviewed lives in a house 10 by 12 meters  with her husband and two children. So  if these four people have 30 square  meters each then to make an average of  12, some other four people have to be  in a space a lot less than the average.  • Pensions for women start at 55 (60 for  men) and to be eligible, a woman must  have been in the paid labour force for  20 years (25 for men). The average pension is given as 40 rubles a month  while minimum subsistence income is 50  rubles a month, (p. 136)  • The inadequacy of housing, income and  child care facilities means dependency  on parents and other family members.  The authors think the family ties prevent loneliness and isolation, although  none of the women interviewed said anything like that.  •Among the many quotes about women's  inability to do their two jobs is  "There's a terrible feeling of frustration among women. They're unsatisfactory as mothers and inadequate at  their work." (p. 184) Whereas the  authors say "We ended up admiring the  strong self-assurance of these women."  In spite of this long list, there is  another list necessary, and that is the  one of what was left out.  The book was printed in 1980; the interviews were done in 1978, before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. But what  about the occupation of Czechoslovakia  in 1968? Or Hungary before that? Was  this really not worth of one single mention? Are Moscow women so apolotical  that their country's invasion of neighbouring countries is of no consequence?  Or is it fear that kept both the interviewers and the interviewed silent on  the matter?  Why is there no mention of racism or  anti-semitism?  There is not one mention of violence,  either in the family or on the streets  (except for a passing comment on page  59 that children are beaten for poor  marks in school). Do all these drunk  males who neglect the housework never  hit their wives or children? If so,  how is this miracle achieved? Or is  violence so common it is too ordinary  to mention? Or is it such a hopeless  subject that nobody wants to talk about  it?  What about that enormous army of conscripted men. Is it the army service  where men learned their drinking? Does  the army service affect one way or another men's refusal to do housework? Do  mothers mind raising their boys to be  soldiers? Are women "emancipated" by  being forced to work outside the home  because so many men are in the army?  Is homosexuality non-existent in Moscow? Or was it simply not relevant in  any of the interviews?  Class is mentioned but not discussed  and most of the women interviewed are  middle class. One of them is quoted as  saying about a schoolmate: "Later we  lost contact with each other - we came  from entirely different worlds. She was  from a working-class family, and she  never went beyond the eighth grade. I  wrote a story about her." (p. 11)  One of the interviewees who is working  class says her mother worked in a factory  where she greased motor parts. In addition to looking after her child, she  cared for a sick sister. Because the  factory job didn't pay enough to live  on, mother and child went around cleaning people's floors, (p. 100)  One gathers from this that to be working  class is hard times in a "classless" society.  On page 13, a woman lists as typically  female professions: textile workers,  doctors, physical therapists, teachers,  cleaners, service workers and collective  farm workers. She gives the reason as low  pay.  This seems to be the only even indirect  reference to peasants, who constitute (I  think) approximately 40% of the population of the USSR. In a footnote on page  134 it is mentioned that before 1976,  peasants were not allowed to leave their  home village but that from 1976 peasants  were also issued the internal passports  required for travel. These passports are  similar to the pass books black people  in South Africa are required to carry.  Without the passport, the peasants were  bound in perpetual serfdom to the collective farm they were born into.  It is entirely possible that the problems  of peasants are of no interest whatsoever  to women in Moscow. But omission of any  mention of concentration camps is odd. I  believe the numbers of men in the camps  MOSCOW Women continued page 28 28   Kinesis March 1986  ARTS  Autonomous women and romantic love  by Shelora Fitzgerald  Like-3 million other readers of Homemaker's  magazine, I have followed Bonnie Kreps'  challenging articles for the past nine  years. Jane Gale, editor of Homemaker's,  has written that Kreps is "monumentally  talented—easily one of the finest  writers in this country."  My interest in her work was sharpened  when I acted in her award-winning This  Film is About Rape.  A sensitive subject  was being dealt with gently, and with  great respect.  Kreps is presently writing a book inspired  by her own romantic excesses. Five years  with the great love of her life had'  brought her to the verge of giving up her  work in order to play Ariel to his Pros-  ipero on a remote West Coast Island. She  was saved from that fate by the magic  words "the spark is gone", and woke  to find herself in one week without  home, office or husband.  Most of us have our own version of  this story. We say "I could write a book!"  The difference is, Kreps is doing it.  She intends to take that embarrassed feeling of "Oh God. How could I?", and  transform it into an analysis of love  from the perspective of autonomous women.  The book is tentatively titled Wake Me When  It 's Over: Romantic Myths and the Independent Woman.  She is the first to admit that she is somebody who is well-equipped to do it. "I  mean, trained as a writer, trained as a  filmmaker, theoretical mind, old radical  feminist, (Kreps was a founding member of  The New Feminists, Canada's first radical  feminist group) highly motivated to do  it, and have enough of a name to get  grants and an advance. So I'm going to do  MOSCOW Women from page 27  far outnumbered the women; nevertheless,  there were many women and children in the  camps. Also the existence of slave labour  camps for so many decades is certainly  one of the determining factors in the  development of the USSR, as important as  binding the peasants to serfdom, and as  important as the inclusion of nearly all  women in the paid labour force.  The labour camps were closed in the 1950's  after Stalin's death. I think the present-  day camps are like our jails in that the  purpose is punishment of individuals rather than provision of slave labour for  industrial projects. But I don't know and  this book does not mention the subject.  With so few books about the Soviet Union  or any part of it, it is disappointing  that this one is so inadequate. Reference  is made in the introduction to the difficulty of obtaining and smuggling out the  interview tapes. Given the almost insurmountable difficulty of getting information out of the Soviet Union, perhaps  this book deserves more respect than I  have given it.  Nevertheless, I would recommend that people read instead Evgenia Ginzburg's two  books, Into the Whirlwind  and Within the  Whirlwind.   (Collins and Harvill Press,  London, 1981). There is also a strange  and fascinating book by Solzhenitsyn  called The Oak and the Calf   which has  fascinating information about class and  censorship, although it is of no value in  terms of any other women's issues. There  are no books that I know of about peasants in the USSR.  What about romance? We both agree that jj  the high you get from romance bears an 1  uncanny resemblance to a drug high.     !*  "Although I must say I've had far greater insights on LSD than on romantic  love!", adds Kreps. "Before it happened,  I knew all the stereotypes and could  predict every crazy stupid thing that  happened to me, but that didn't stop  me." In fact, my initial motivation for  writing the book was to see just what  kind of fantasies I had built up when  they all came crashing down."  "You try saying something sane and reasonable about autonomous women and  romantic love in our idiSt culture and  ■£'  see how far you get."  "I had to come to terms with what I  would call both the truth and the  fraudulence of romance. I think the  essence of romantic love is not  the  feeling you have for the person. It's  more to the point, the experience of  being in that state. So you enjoy the  rapture,  and your love object - I use  the word advisedly - is simply the  mechanism whereby you get your own  rapture going."  "I think you play a mutual game of  'trophy-time.' You  get to have it  all, feminism, work, and a man who isn't  scared of your strength, who in fact  claims to find you even more attrac-  "Thank goodness! I was scared to death he'd slay that  dragon, and I'd have to marry him."  tive because of it. "At last, you say,  "My Prince!" And you start acting like  a silly twit. We autonomous women  become reverse Sleeping Beauties; we  don't wake up when Prince Charming  kisses us, we fall asleep. The  problem is that behind the image lurks'  the true character  of the person with whom  you're having the pleasure. And I believe  character, not biology, is destiny.

Big Mountain continued from page 14  the pollution that's happening isn't, just  affecting the red people, it's affecting  all people.  If people want to support nuclear disarmament, or block the transporting of  nuclear waste, they should protest the  mining of uranium on native land. The  native people of the U.S. and Canada  own ninety percent of the uranium left  on this continent. And they own sixty  to ninety percent of all the other  ores and minerals that the multinationals  want. The traditional people don't  want any resource exploration to happen,  they don't want it to be taken out of  the ground at all.  If people around the globe could support  that and place the land in sanctuary and  call for a moratorium on the taking of  natural resources, we would be able to  stop the oppressors in their tracks.  The same multinationals that are oppressing here, are oppressing people in  South Africa, Central America, all over  the globe. We just have to identify  them. Everybody has to get involved to  make greater demands on the manufacturers to start making goods that can be  developed in an environmentally sound  manner.  The government gave the people nine  years to relocate on their own.  What  happens to the people who have refused  to leave?  The deadline for relocation is July 6,  1986. The people have stated that it's  their life, their land and their culture,  and they are refusing to move. The government has stated that if military action  is necessary, it will be utilized in  getting these people off the land.  The U.S. is moving a lot of military  equipment into the area and the national  guard is building water towers in the  desert. I can. guarantee you that it's  not for watering the sheep.  How can people help?  Preparations are being made for the  resistance and we need to make sure that  there is an active support system to  help them while they are resisting. The  Hopi people have gone to the United  Nations three times to ask the nations  of the world to reprimand the U.S. for  their actions against native people.  This coming year they will be going to  the U.N. for their fourth and final  attempt. People can start a letter-writing  campaign to the Canadian government and  ask that Canada recognize the Hopi  People and support them when they  come to the U.N.. Canadians can also  put pressure on the U.S. government  to repeal the law. People can educate  themselves and their communities  about the Big Mountain struggle and  native issues throughout Canada and  the U.S. It's important not only  to stand up for the Human Rights in  the rest of the world, but also  right here in our own back yard.

BARRISTER & SOLICITOR ARTS  Making full with mime  by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  The San Francisco Mime Troupe is no longer  a mime Company. But although they have  switched to spoken theatre, they prefer to  keep their name, and consider themselves to  be miming in the sense of mimicking, or  making fun. And make fun is exactly what  they did in their recent performance at the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre, "Crossing  Borders".  Unaware audiences who arrived at the Cultural Centre expecting to see the subtle elegance of traditional pantomime may have been  disappointed. But for viewers looking for an  entertaining evening of political humour,  the performance was a success.  When Viva (Marga Gomez), an over eager  young lesbian activist agrees to an immigration marriage with Juan (Eduardo Rob-  ledo), a Salvadorian refugee, without  telling her lover Rhodessa (Audrey Smith)  under the misapprehension that Juan is a  revolutionary hero who must be protected  at all costs, the result is a real comedy  of errors.  Viva is caught in the ridiculous position  of simultaneously trying to convince the  immigration officer (Gus Johnson) that hers  is a true marriage based on love at first  sight, trying to convince the confused Juan  that neither is the marriage to be consum-  ated nor is he to move his relatives (all  played by Wilma Bonet) into her and her  "roommate" Rhodessa's home, and trying to  convince the suspicious Rhodessa that  nothing is amiss. Of course she gets her  self embroiled deeper and deeper in her  tangle of deceptions, and it is only the  resources of Rhodessa and Juan's newly  arrived mama which save the day.  This sort of broad comedy is difficult to  . manage without ridiculing the characters  involved. As soon as you set up your audience to laugh at a character's distress,  that person is robbed of dignity and  self respect. If the character in question  is already a member of an oppressed group  (such as political refugees or lesbians)  there is a risk of feeding into negative  stereotypes about members of these groups.  The San Francisco Mime Troupe skillfully  treads on the safe side of this delicate  line in their humour, perhaps because they  are speaking of issues which touch the  lives of members of the company, perhaps  because they are playing to a sympathetic  audience.  Kinesis March 1986   29  And those pf us who make up thStipaudience,  we on the left and in the lesbian and feminist community, are badly in need of a few  laughs. Like Viva, caught up in trying to  make a better world, we often take ourselves  too seriously. Because so much mainstream  humour, like television or the comics, is  based on the very hierarchical and sexist  attitudes which we are trying to change,  we are not left with a great deal to  laugh at.  And of course, despite its cartoon-like  style, the issues dealth with in "Crossing  Borders" are serious ones. The story is  based on a documentary radio series representing the experiences and struggles  of refugees from El Salvador. The program  notes list the increasing U.S. military  aid which is being sent to Central America,  and give us a history of what specific  sorts of people have been excluded from  entering the United States by American  immigration laws. We cannot be reminded too  often of the grim realities of American-  supported repressive regimes, and perhaps  audiences which would close down to political rhetoric will listen while they  laugh.  The San Francisco Mime Troupe has a style  that is loud and fast and lively. At times  they seemed too loud for an intimate  theatre like the Cultural Centre. But they  are very funny and worthwhile. It is unfortunate that the price prohibited more  people from bringing their children to the  performance, for we certainly need more of  this sort of entertainment for our children. I hope they will come back again,  perhaps next time playing not just in the  theatre, but in the park where they would  be accessible to everyone;  With the power of each breath  hv Eunice Brooks - taking 21 days to travel from Canada to       women. S  by Eunice Brooks  With the Power of Each Breath: A Disabled'  Women's Anthology,   ed. by Susan E. Brown,  Debra Connors, and Nanci Stern, Cleis Press.  Pittsburgh & San Francisco, 1985.  If I learned anything while reading With  the Power of Each Breath,   it is that pain  is as individual as a signature or a face.  The faces of the 45 contributors are so  open to the reader that at times I felt  the hairs rising on my arms and goose  flesh forming. This book is no amateurish  collection of how-it-hurts-to-hurt pieces.  It is a well edited, and brilliantly  written collection of poems, essays, journals, parables, plays and other writings.  In the opening poem, "The Wolf", Susan  Hansell writes: "I write down when it  hurts." If anything that is the key to  this book, but the book is not about pain.  Her poem tells about her disease, lupis,  and is rightfully the showpiece. It can  stand with the best modern poetry offered  anywhere. I dare anyone to read it and  not respond. The book's title is taken  from this poem.  With the Power of Each Breath came out of  a workshop on disability and the editors  point out they were swamped with contributions.  In the introduction they tell how many of  the cover letters taught them that writing  was, in itself, therapeutic. They had to  arrange for taped and braille versions, as  well as a paperback one. What they have  produced should be open to criticism, but  I have nothing but praise for it. There is  something in this book for everyone.  One. of the older contributors is Rosina  Davies, 93. She writes as one of the members of a reminiscence group,_in an extended care hospital. She tells of going  through the Panama Canal in a sailing craft  • taking 21 days to travel  Scotland. She says: "When I was 29, I thought  that was old."  A much younger writer, Robyn Miller is 20.  She has cystic fibrosis. She tells of the  last months spent with her friend Lisa Ann  who died in 1982.  Miller says: "Please don't let me make you  angry. Only a few more months together and  we're at it again, spending our time arguing and creating bad memories. It's not that  I don't understand what you're going through.  It's just that I'm sick, but you're sicker."  The editors made a commitment to produce an  anthology representative of■all disabled  women, and in the 350 pages, they come close.  They recognized early that the capabilities  of disabled women are not taken seriously,  in spite of people like Helen Keller.  What is totally lacking in the anthology  is the sense of childishness and helplessness that is the stereotype of disabled  women. What comes through is a sense of  triumph over enormous conflict.  One problem addressed by a number of  writers is the inaccessibility to feminist groups for the disabled. The writer  who makes this most clear is Emily Levy  who suffers from environmental illness.  She becomes ill when exposed to cigarette  smoke, perfume, and a number of other  toxins that can be lethal to her. Yet  at a feminist gathering she had to leave  because her sisters refused to stop  smoking when she asked politely. Levy  is unable to work because the marketplace is full of dangers for her, she  had hoped to find some comfort in feminist groups.  Barbara Airman writes a well researched  essay on the disadvantages disabled  women face. She found that social  status, employment, and income are most  often denied women, who tend to be proportionately poorer than able-bodied  She also points out that women's  access to rehabilitation care is less  then men's.  Airman's findings about marriages show  that women usually stay in a marriage  if the husband becomes disabled, perhaps because we are trained to nurture,  but men tend to disappear when a disability hits the wife.  Such an anthology about pain and separation  and the constant struggle to survive  need not ignore love and sexuality. The  disabled lust just like anyone else. Diane  Hugs tells the story of two lesbians in  wheelchairs on opposite sides of the  bed, for the first time, both terrified.  She writes: "When I was an able-bodied  lesbian, my approach to relating sexually  had been to find out what moves- turned  someone on and go from there. Never before  the onset of multiple sclerosis have I  taken the time or had the opportunity"  to begin a relationship -with such a  beautiful feeling of exploration. Although  few women discussed sexuality explicitly,  it is there, nevertheless, all through  the book.  If what you want to read is "God got me  through this" you won't find it in With  the Power of Each Breath.  The strength  inherent is the strength in the writers.  Many of them will die of their disabilities, and they have learned to live with  that knowledge, and also to gain enjoyment from the "little things" along the  way. Evidently, for disabled women, a  little irony goes all the way.  I recommend this book as a good read one  should put on the bedside table, and take  in one section at a time. Some pieces take  five minutes, some can be read at a glance.  With any others one will will need to go  back over and over and savour, them. What is |  certain is that the anthology cannot be  ignored. It is a valuable tool in one's  self education about humanity. 30   Kinesis March 1986  by Deb Thomas  The .Land of Look Behind: Prose and  Poetry by Michelle Cliff, Firebrand  Books (Ithaca, N.I.: 1985), 119 p.,  $6.95  (U.S.)  In the "personal-is-political" genre,  many woman writers find themselves  needing to choose one oppressed identity on which they must focus. Michelle  Cliff, a woman, a lesbian, and  a woman  of colour, has had this choice made  difficult for her by having three to  choose from.  Cliff is a light-skinned Jamaican with  "light eyes" and "tall" (wavy) hair.  She has been able to "pass" as Caucasian  for most of her life. Her parents were  part of a light-skinned, mixed-race  middle class which has traditionally  embraced anglocization and rejected its  "dark side."  This book is the literary expression of  Cliff's exodus into awareness and  rage into the parodoxes of her mixed  blood status and deeper into her own  dark side. She has then, of necessity,  chosen to focus largely on colour in  her writing.  She doesn't ignore her lesbianism or  her femaleness, however. She credits  feminism with being the catalyst that  led to her politicization about her  colour. She weaves her lesbianism  and her feminism in and out of her  other exploration, showing how she  must sometimes choose the defense of  one over the others. She stresses  that, even among her black brothers,  these other identities can set her  apart and create concentric circles  of oppression.  The collection begins with a preface  called A Journey into Speech which  documents her progression from academic to rebel poet.

V5N 5K5  hind the relationship of her language  to its content.  She discusses the fragmentation, the  need to begin by forming a bond with  her own history, her growing rage at  the oppressors of the world's Black  peoples, and shows how her language  changes, in relation to this progression.  Her writing style throughout is direct  and simple. She says by way of explanation for this lack of poetic adornment:  I wanted that kind of directness in my  writing,  as I came into closer contact  with my rage, and a realization that  rage could fuel and shape my work...  I knew I wanted to tell exactly how  things were,  what had been done,   to  us and by us,  without muddying the  issue with conventional beauty, avoiding  becoming trapped in the grace of language for its sake, which is always  Though I am of the personal belief  that honesty and beauty need not be  mutually exclusive in poetry, I know  the seductiveness of using "language  for its own sake" and I respect her  honesty in this matter.  Early in the historical part of the  book (excerpts from her book Claiming  An Identity They Taught Me To Despise),  she remembers, in this direct way,  how her Jamaican culture divided madness by gender:  It must have meant something that all  those mad were women.  The men were .  called idiots  (an accident of birth)  —or drunks.  The women 's madness was ascribed to  several causes: childlessness,  celibacy,  "change":  such was the nature of their  naive science. Ip^ssti?  In the long poem, Claiming an Identity  They Taught Me To Despise,   she explores  simultaneously the oppression of being  "creole" and being woman, linking the  violence of both oppressions:  ! into service,  moved into the  great house—early on.  Daughters of the masters/whores of the  masters  At one with the great house/at odds  with the great house  Setting fire to the great house/the  masters/sometimes ourselves.  In a later section, If I Could Write  This In Fire, I Would Write This In  Fire,   she recounts an incident which  clearly shows the way in which the opr  pressed can oppress each other.  Cliff has taken her "recognizably  Black" Jamaican cousin, Henry, into a  bar in London. They are refused service because of his colour.  Henry 's eyes fill up,  but he refuses  to believe our informant.   "No, man,  the girl is just busy." (The girl is  a fifty-year-old white woman,  who may  just be following orders. But I do  not mention this. I have chosen sides.)  Cliff takes Henry and some of his white  friends to a restaurant owned by gay  men, instead, in hopes that here they  will not encounter prejudice. But she  watches as:  A turnaround occurs at dinner. Henry  joins the white men in a sustained  mockery of the waiters:  their accent  and the way they walk.  Later, when Cliff has left Henry,  managing to avoid his aggressive  (though largely verbal) sexual advances, she tries to forget the whole  event, but can't:  I remember our different skins and our  different experiences within them. And  I have a hard time realizing that I can  angry with Henry.  That to him—no use  in pretending—a queer is a queer.  And, she might have added, a woman is  just a Woman, no matter who she is.  Toward the end of the collection, in a  section called Love in the Third World,  Cliff challenges the complacency of  . liberal North Americans in a poem called  Constructive Engagement.  Part of the poem is the story of a  'Black girl-child' who must testify at  a murder trial in a white court. Her  seven-year-old Black friend was run  over and killed by a white man. Cliff  praises her for her "courage—for that  is  what it is—in standing up, school  dress, hair braided, in a White court  before a white jury and a white defen-  dent and his white family" and telling  the plain truth about what she saw. She  ends the poem with the provocative:  Tell me if I saw what I thought I saw.  Tell me if you will whether this happened in New York or Pretoria,  L.A.  of Johannesburg. Don't ever tell me  that South Africa makes America  better by comparison.  This is a book in which the reader  (especially if she is herself a writer)  will learn a.great deal about the relationship between language and oppression, as well as about the struggle  toward liberated language. It is a  work which betrays Cliff's academic  origins by its thoroughness and intelligence, and deliberately belies  them as she changes style and technique freely to suit content and feeling. Not always easy reading, particularly for whites, it is worth every  minute you will spend with it.

Look for it in May.  I'm often a little apologetic about my  passion for Science Fiction. I hear myself  explain defensively "I'm not into the  Star Wars  kind of book: I'm angry that  Science Fiction terminology is being used  to mask the threatening nature.of the U.S.  weapons system. Besides I mainly read  science fiction (or speculative fiction  as it's often called these days) by women!  In fact, the first science fiction book I  remember reading was by a man: Fahrenheit  451,  by Ray Bradbury. The title refers to  the temperature at which books burn. I was  chilled by the evilness of the ultimate,  censorious State, and thrilled by the courage of the rebellious community that was  secretly memorizing the classics for future generations. The dual themes—fear  for the direction society is taking and  fierce dedication to change—echoed my  own developing perception of the world  and my place in it, and at 15, I became  an avid fan of the genre.  In the late 60's around the time I started  to hear about women's liberation, the  science fiction's depiction of women as  perennial mothers and wives, tempting sex  objects or malevolent matriarchs began to  really bother me. In the light of my feminist consciousness, it looked as if my  reading habits might have to change!  I began to search out women SF authors;  there were very few, and I found them  mainly in anthologies of short stories,  culled from the many SF pulp magazines.  These women - Ursula K. LeGuin, Vonda  Mclntyre, Anne McCaffrey, JoAnna Russ -  were writing about women from a perspective that really excited me because I  could identify with it. Within the literary conventions of SF, these authors  invented whole new worlds, races, even  languages to explore the experience of  women. They asked the question,"What if...?'  And they provided an infinite number of  answers.  What if women and men shared equal power  in the world? What would a world be like  where women were dominant? Where there  were only women? Where either sex could  bear children? What if the oppression  of women is maintained? Or intensified?  What qualities are innate to women—  mothering, heterosexuality? Is violence"  innate to men?  In the last 15 years, the number of women  SF writers has increased, and they are  asking more questions. Future columns will  look at specific themes as well as new  releases. This month, as an introduction  to women's SF, here are some short story  collections to sample.  Firefollod and Other Stories  by Vonda Mclntyre  Timescape,  1979  Vonda Mclntyre writes about women who  possess enormous personal power, though  they lack status and authority in their  society. This collection contains the marvellous story, Of Mist,  Grass, and Sand,  first published in 1975, and the kernel of  Mclntyre's prizewinning novel, Dreamsnake.  About a remarkable healer and her encounter with a mistrustful family, the power  of the story lies in the healer's comfortable and loving relationship with the  creatures who assist her in her work; the  readdr's fear and distaste dissolve in  admiration for the intuitive and practical  process of healing.  The title story is about another unusual  woman, physically altered for her work as  an explorer of new worlds and now a fugitive from a betraying society. A solitary  and tragic figure, she is still able to  delight in her power:  She...lumbered up the flank of the volcano.  She could feel it beneath her feet...  its long rumbles pulsed through her, at  a far lower frequency than she ever could  have heard as a human.  It promised heat  and danger;  it excited her.  She had experienced no extremes,  of either heat or  cold, pressure or vacuum,  for far too  many months.  The Women Who Loved th(  by Elizabeth A. Lynn  Berkley Books,   1981  One of the things I like best about women's  SF is the attentive depiction of everyday  life: children, cooking, dress. Elizabeth  Lynn is wonderful at combining imaginative  stories about adventurous heroines with  fine, down-to-earth detail. Best known  for The Chronicles of Tornor,  a three-  book saga, her short fiction is also delightful .  One story in this collection, The Gods of  Reorth,   is about enormous, planet-controlling power and it's also a love story between two women, Jael, the Goddess, and  Akys, a mountain-woman of Reorth. Jael  takes human form and begins to share  Akys' simple life:  Akys! she would call from the house,  flinging wide the door. And Akys,   kneeling .  by the 'stream, water bucket in hand,  felt  her heart lift at that clear,   lovely  call.   'yes'. '  'Can I stuff quail with nuts?'  'Have we enough?'  'Tthink so. '  'Slice them thin. '  Quite another mood is described in Jubilee's  Story.   Several women enroute to a women's  colony stop for the night in Upper Misery (!)  where men and women still "follow the old  customs." Jubilee and her friends come upon  a woman in labour and are shocked at her  The women act as midwives and plant seeds  of liberation in the process.  The Wind's Twelve Quarters  by Ursula K. LeQuin  Bantam Books,   1975  Ursula LeGuin is another of. my favourite  writers. Her explorations of new political  possibilities and worlds without sex roles  make fascinating reading. Her novel, The  Left Hand of Darkness,   describes the  androgynous world of Gethen as perceived  by an alien from earth who is continually  confused and threatened by the lack of  gender distinction.  One story in this collection, Winter's King,  takes place on Gethen and was written a  year before the novel. In this anthology's  version, LeGuin uses the feminine pronoun  for all the Gethenians, at the same time  employing masculine titles, such as Lord  and King". In her intro to the story, "the  ambiguity, she says, may drive some non-  feminists mad, but that's only fair." I  loved it!  Another story, The Day Before the Revolution  is about Odo, the woman who created the  anarchist political theory elaborated in  The Dispossessed,   another highly acclaimed  LeGuin novel.  In this story, Odo is now old, the victim  of a stroke, and her portrayal as a crotchety  and even sentimental woman is delightful and  moving. She muses defiantly,  The young people...had grown up in the  principle of freedom of dress and sex  and all the rest, and she hadn't. All she  had done was invent it. It's not the  same. Like speaking of Asieo as   'my husband'.  They winced.  The word she should use as a  good Odonian, of course,  was   'partner.'  But why the hell did she have to be a  good Odonian?  A passage to warn the heart of anyone  who's ever been politically incorrect!  Dispatches from the Frontiers of the Female Mind  edited by Jen Green & Sarah Lefanu  The Women 's Press,  London,  England 1985  "They had her trussed up in the old way,  lying-flat on her bed, with sheet strips  lying limp and ready for her to pull upon.  She was breathing in raggedy chops. When  we came in, she scrambled for a sheet to  cover herself, as if there was something  to be ashamed of in being ready to give  birth!"  This collection of stories by seventeen  different authors looks at contemporary  issues in an SF format: women and work,  birth and reproduction, technology. Well-  known writers are represented as well  as women who are here in print for the  first time. The Awakening,  by Pearlie  McNeill, and Morality Meat,   by Raccoona  Sheldon (who sometimes writes under the  name of James Tiptree Jr.) are two stories  about a terrifying future when reproduction is totally controlled by the State  and the anti-choice elements have won.  On another note entirely, Joanna Russ'  The Cliches From Outer Space  is a hilarious and very satisfying spoof on male-  dominated SF. Beverly Ireland's story,  Long Shift,   is a matter-of-fact description of a worker's ultimately dramatic  day in a women's community of the future.  Technical details are interspersed with  glimpses into life as a worker at the City  Women's Industrial Co-op where the static  electricity in the sealed buildings is  still giving women grief.  The science fiction I like is about women's  lives. It's funny, tragic futuristic,  contemporary, lyrical, exciting and, above  all, absolutely absorbing. Next column I'll  be looking at LeGuin's newest novel,  Always Coming Home  which comes complete  with a cassette of Music of the People of  Kesh.

LETTERS  DAWN conference  booked up  Kinesis:  We have some bad news and some good  news. First, the bad news: the Dis-  Abled Women's Network B.C. (DAWN BC)  provincial conference is booked solid  and has been since early February.  The good news is the same thing. There  are 60 women with a cross-section of  disabilities coming together from every  part of the province for the very  first time to share with each other  our experiences, triumphs and pain.  When the committee began its work,  our first priority was to make this  conference the start of a strong provincial network of women with disabilities. We had no idea that when  we made the long distance calls to  assess the level of interest and  need, we would generate such a large  snowball so quickly. From the response,  it would appear that the first DAWN  BC conference is a good idea whose  time has come.  We would like to let you know that we  have been keeping a cancellation list  and a mailing list and held a general  membership meetings on February 22. We  will be holding another on April 5  (11:00 a.m., G.F. Strong Rehabilitation  Centre, 4255 Laurel St., Vancouver,  Basement Conference Room). We hope  that interested women from the lower  mainland will attend this meeting and  strengthen the network there.

Praise and criticism  for Kinesis  Kinesis:  Congratulations on the commencement of  another year of feminist publishing! Like  cockroaches, we may be small and unappealing to some, but we are many, we are  strong and we endure and evolve. I hope  you don't mind the comparison, but it's  my way of saying we were here before Bill  Bennett and his mega-projects and we will  still be here after his political demise.  Metaphors aside, it's that time of year  again - time to renew my subscription. I  appreciate your special deal to renew at  the old rates, but in the light of your  financial difficulties, I feel inspired  to throw some extra money into the kitty.  I thought about your offer to renew for  several years at the old rate, but I  can't help but wonder if you'll get  caught in a squeeze as production and  postal rates rise. My conclusion is to  spread Kinesis  (and my money) around by  giving some gift subscriptions. That way,  you might have three renewals next year  instead of one.  Although you've already received and published a great deal of criticism on your  Nov. '85 issue, I feel compelled to add  my thoughts and feelings on the topic.  Having been in the graphic arts for many  years, and worked on many a feminist publication (including a few issues of Kinesis) , I realize the power, and subsequent  responsibility, that goes with the layout  of any piece.  I am very dissappointed by what I judge  to be the irresponsible use of colour,  imagery and type on that issue's cover.  In its sensationalism, it did a great  disservice by misrepresenting the purpose  of karate-do. The slashes of red, the  hard edges produced by close-cropping the  photo, the proximity of the words "rape"  and "military" to the photo, all combine  to perpetuate the myth that karate promotes aggression and violence.  To the contrary, however, Master Funako-  shi states "the aim of karate lies .. in  the perfection of the character of its  participants"..This is reinforced by the  example of our sensei (teacher) and the  dojo kun (statement of ethics) that is  recited in every training.  • Seek perfection of character  • Be faithful • Endeavor  • Respect others • Refrain from violent  behavior  I had hoped that the interest Kinesis.  had shown in our club would help dispel  the myth that keeps many women from developing their own strengths through  karate training.  On a more personal note, I am especially  disappointed because when I heard that a  photo of myself and my sensei, Dulce Oika-  was, was appearing on the front cover, I  was, like the song about "The Rolling  Stone", going "to send five copies to my  mother". After more than eleven years in  the women's community in Vancouver, I had  finally made the cover of Kinesis,  and I  couldn't bring myself to send one to my  mom. Shucks...  The above criticism not withstanding,  thanks for all the hard work.  Alleson Kase  Women and Words  saddened  Kinesis:  We were saddened to learn that the Toronto Women & Words Pan Canadian Conference  Organizing Committee have decided that  they will not be holding the June, 1986  conference as planned.  Since Women and Words groups function  autonomously and regionally, we can only  say that here in B.C. we hope to learn  from these Toronto Women & Words experiences and reaffirm our commitment to be  aware of and respect our diversity.  Yours truly,  Helen Williams  for W.C.W.W.S. Board, Vancouver  Mdwives advance  in Ontario  Kinesis:  True to form, the big dailies gave page  99 coverage to a piece of news which is a  big "win" for the women's movement. The  Ontario Liberal Government has shown  leadership and vision by committing themselves to the introduction of midwifery  care for the childbearing women of their  province. It is an acknowledgement of how  far women have come politically that this  should happen despite the resistance of  the medical societies. When history  changes it is impossible to look back and  say exactly what caused it. In this case  it was probably a combination of many  courageous acts by many ordinary folks.  The Task Force that has been put together  in Ontario includes the woman lawyer who  Kinesis March 1986   33  represented two midwives at a Coroner's  inquest last year, a very progressive woman family doctor, Alan Schwartz from the  Government, and a nursing professor. The  midwives who currently practice are reported to be very pleased with the whole  board.  What are the implications of legal midwifery in Ontario?  1. There will finally be a Canadian school  to train midwives that can give a certificate which is recognized.  2. We will see the end of an era of aggressive acts against women's bodies  (excessively high cesarean rates and  forceps use, unnecessary episiotomies,  anaesthetics used to replace supportive  care). The midwife is the guardian of  the normal and takes pride in protecting Nature's process from intervention  as long as the health of a woman and  her baby are not suffering.  3. We will see a healing of the family  which will extend out to the community,  the country and the world. In case you  haven't noticed, there is a great deal  of social breakdown in our communities  at present. The presence of more "wise  women" and healers is badly needed.  4. The medical profession will be enhanced  by the work of midwives attending the  healthy, normal pregnant woman. She  will encourage and nurture breastfeeding which produces lifelong health  benefits and will act as a first resource in minor ailments that do not  require physician treatment - doctors  will be freed up to remedy pathology.  5. The other provinces in Canada will be  pressured now to provide this choice  for their citizens.  6. Canadians will discover to their delight and astonishment that midwives  are not a band of hippy holdovers but  a mature, responsible group of women  heroines who have weathered a period of  near extinction but have never totally  died.  I really want women everywhere to know  that the work we all do that sometimes  feels so useless and unrecognized is all  a part of what produces a result like  this. It's important to just stop and  let in the acknowledgement that things  can be changed and women are very powerful when we network.  I really thank you all at Kinesis  for  your unstinting support of Mary Sullivan  and myself in the past year. Also for  being a voice for action on all the issues that never look very nice in the  fashion pages, I really acknowledge you.  Please let your readers know about the  recognition of midwifery in Ontario,  it's a turning point in Canadian women's  history.
