We  decided to focus this month on some international events that are in the dailies but, as  usual, the stories keep forgetting to tell us  where women are in all that's going on. So  we taped and transcribed NAC president  Sunera Thobani's talk on her recent trip to  South Africa [seepage 9], talked to Palestinian women about the peace negotiations  between the representatives of the Palestinians and the state of Israel [see page 10], and  interviewed South Asian feminist activist  Himani Bannerji on fundamentalism and  communalism in India [see page 12].  By the way, we heard Yasser Arafat  (Palestine) and Yitzhak Rabin (Israel) have  been co-nominated for the 1994 Nobel Peace  Prize! Last year's nobel peace prize went to  de Klerk (Afrikaner) and Nelson Mandela  (ANC)...! What, we wonder, is it with this  trend of erasing history and equating oppressors and oppressed?! This is a rhetorical  question.  Well, we'll be bringing you lots more  from South Africa-as we tell you in Inside  Kinesis below, we have our very own feminist correspondent in the country during the  elections—perhaps we'll even bring you next  month's "As Kinesis goes to press" from the  frontlines of feminist activism in South  Africa...the facts, the figures, the news,  the...yeah, gossip, the latest joke in the office  [of Speak Magazine in Johannesburg, where  our rep will be working] and so on.  Speaking of latest jokes, here'sone that's  getting stale so we'll tell you quickly before  it's not funny any more. ..(actually, this could  only be funny if you've followed the Lorena  Bobbitt story) Question: What's the new  symbol of North American feminism? Answer: Fingers going Snip, snip, snip (this  joke could be funnier if we were visual  media)...  Anyway, back to South Africa, watch  our features pages for more in-depth reports  on women active in the struggle and in  elections work in next month's issue...or in  May, when our rep returns. If she does...she  says that if the Speak's workspace houses a  less temperamental computer than the one  in the Kinesis production room, she may  decide to stay on longer...  Speaking of workplaces, now that  women have finally managed to put sexual  harassment on the agenda at workplaces, in  unions, government, even in the mainstrea m  media, there are a number of resources being produced.. one esteemed establishment-  -theOntario Women's Directorate (Ontario's  equivalent to BC's Ministry of Women's  Equality)~sent us a flyer promoting their  "new products" on sexual harassment in the  workplace in the form of five distinct packages. What struck us was that the guide for  employers called "A Time for Action on  Sexual Harassment in the Workplace" is  available for free, while the training manual  for employees, called "Sexual Harassment:  It's Everyone's Business" costs a whopping  $64.20! Really! We're speechless!  There's a funny story Kinesis came across  in the Globe, that self-described national  newspaper, about there being "Too Many  Immigrants, First Nations say," about First  Nations people being polled on their views  about immigration to Kanada. We looked  closer and realized this is not what the Globe  had written. Someone had liquid-papered  over the original text: so where it once read  "Too many Immigrants, many say," the liquid-paper feminist had substituted "...First  Nations say." Where it said especially "visible minorities" they had changed it to "visibly white minorities from Europe." We've  decided to cheer ourselves up in future by  spoofing everything we read in the dailies at  least once a week!  Kinesis is often accused of not being  humourous enough...guess all feminists/  activists get that at some point. But, yeah, it's  true. We don't laugh enough sometimes. So  to liven things up this month, we've put  together some laughs from the past as part  of our celebration of 20 years of feminist  publishing at Kinesis on page ...  Then there are the really unfunny  things., .we got a fax from Toronto last month  asking us to watch our backs, someone sent  Judy Rebick a bullet in the mail through  NAC...later we found out bullets had been  sent out to 12 prominent, progressive Jewish  activists in Toronto...the police, apparently,  are still trying to narrow down the area it  came from. This, together with the "Too  many immigrants, many say" national story  last month, and the first Liberal federal  government budget (which didn't have  much good news...also saw cuts of about 5  percent to women's centres, among other  things [see story, page 3]), the demise of  Healthsharing and news that Pandora may  be next [see story page 5] made it somewhat  of an "interesting" (read: depressing) month  for us.  Still, there's lots going on locally, pro-  vincially, nationally, internationally, that  gives us heart. Read the listings in "Bulletin  Board" for events and meetings to attend,  who'sdoingwhat, who's writingwhat, who's  reading what...

The "headline" speaker is Judy  Rebick (wasn't she the one with the portable  phone during the the 1992 referendum or  something? Or something?) and rumour has  it, Sandy Schof ield, theFirst Nations woman  singer oft heard in Downtown Eastside Vancouver may be performing. (This is not fact  yet). Tickets are $30 (gosh, guess this really is  a fundraiser...) wait a minute, subsidies will  be available... call Micheat255-5511formore  info.

Oh, one last thing just came in...there's a  new hot book from Kiss and Tell, a lesbian  artists collective, Her Tongue on my Theory,  published by Press Gang Publishers. There's  going to be a book launch in early May, so  watch out for details in our next issue.  That's it, the deadline bell tolls. Till next  month.  THANKS  Thanks to the Vancouver Municipal and  Regional Employees Union for their donation to Kinesis in support of the Aboriginal  Women's Supplement in the December/  January 1994 issue.  It's springtime, and we're inside working hard to bring you all the news about  women that's not in the dailies. Okay...to be  honest, we didn't even remember that it  changed season until we went into VSW's  meeting room with a view and got hit by the  glare of the sunset. '  Fortunately, we, the veteran Kinesis  women, didn't have to do this issue alone.  We were able to entice some new volunteers  out of the sunshine and into the production  room. (Actually, it snowed on the night  before press day.) A big welcome to new  production volunteers Amal Hassan-keyd,  Karen Backman, and Teresa McCarthy. If  you want to help out with the next production, call Agnes at 255-5499.  Also, welcome to new Kinesis writer  Hanan Elmasu, who did an interview with  four Palestinian women on the Palestinian-  Israeli agreement (see pg 10).  And hey...we have a new graphic  artist...Robyn Hall! Robyn's a tireless volunteer who discovered there is more to production than just cutting and pasting, and  thought she'd try something new. Check  out her cartoon for the federal budget story  on page 3. We look forward to what she  comes up with for the next issue.  On to Ed Board business...Sad goodbyes to Sur Mehat and Anne Jew who are  leaving the Ed Board. Anne says she needs  some time off to work on all her various  projects, but also says she might re-join in  the summer. We hope she will...but, we  should warn her that she'll have] to undergo  the Kinesis Ed Board initiation again! Manisha  Singh, who we welcomed to the Ed Board a  few months ago, is taking a le^ve to go to  India. She says she'll be back in three  months...that's a long time. Bye, Manisha.  Don't forget to send us postcards!  There's lots happening around the office. The big news is: Fatima Jaffer, who  works tirelessly editing Kinesis and dealing  with all the day-to day stuff around the  paper, is off for seven weeks. Fatima will be  in South Africa as part of N AC's delegation  to observe the elections in April. Fatima will  be working with Speak, a feminist magazine  published in Johannesberg. Next issue, we'll  be getting reports from Fatima in South  Africa as part of Kinesis' ongoing commitment to building solidarity with women  around the world.  By the way, we are accepting donations  to help cover the costs of this once in a lifetime opportunity. If you're able to contribute to sending Fatima to South Africa, please  send donations to VSW.  Don't worry...with Fatima away, it  doesn't mean that no one will be taking care  of Kinesis. Lynne Wanyeki and Larissa Lai  are going to guest-edit the May issue. Both  Lynne and Larissa have worked on Kinesis  before, and worked a whole lot on writing  and editing this issue. Have fun, you two!  Please note that the office will only be open  part-time for the next month.  Okay, one .last thing...If you haven't  noticed yet, Kinesis is celebrating its twentieth year of continuous publication. As we do  every year, we're going to hold a Kinesis  benefit in June—watch for details next  month—to thank women who support us  year round. Buj this year, we're going to  make T-shirts and postcards to mark our  anniversary. Get them while they're hot!  -^^♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦/^■♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦'O' News  Women and the 1994 federal budget:  What else is new?  by Jackie Brown  Like death and taxes, it's a sure bet that  government budgets rarely live up to campaign promises—especially promises made to  women. And so it was with last month's federal budget, say women's and anti-poverty  groups. .  Despite Liberal commitments to work  towards ending women's social and economic  inequality, the budget offers nothing that will  promote real change, say organizations like  the National Action Committee on the Status  of Women (NAC) and, in fact, is a sign of  worse times to come.  Among the main criticisms: no additional  money for women's groups, most of which are  still reeling from previous Tory cuts; no funding for programs aimed at ending violence  against women; reductions in unemployment  insurance benefits that will especially hurt low  income women workers; a $6 billion job creation program that benefits mostly men; freezes  and /or cuts to federal income assistance transfer payments to the provinces; and a public  sector wage freeze that will have the most  effect on workers at the low end of the pay  scale—many of whom are women.  There is also much concern that the introduction of unemployment insurance (UIC)  and seniors age tax credit eligibility requirements are further indications that the Liberals  plan to end universality of social programs.  And, organizations say, the government's  Overall,  there is nothing  in the budget  that will  significantly benefit  women  promise to consult with Canadians during the  social policy review process amounts to little  more than lip service, since before the review  even starts, cuts are being made.  (The two-year review will examine all  federal social assistance programs, including  transfer payments designed to help provinces  pay for education, health care, childcare, and  social assistance. It is framed as part of the  Liberals' commitment to ensuring the system  is "financially sustainable over the long term  and responsive to the needs of individuals and  businesses.")  Overall, says Jackie Larkin, a NAC-BC  regional representative, there is nothing in the  budget that will significantly benefit women.  Those who have the least will continue to bear  most of the burden of social program cuts and  there is no relief in sight.  "For example, while at this point it looks  like women's groups may not get a funding  cut this year," says Larkin," the government  has made it clear that they will be reviewing  funding to interest groups. They've served  notice." In the meantime, she says, already  poorly-funded organizations will have to rely  on project money. This not only compromises  independence, says Larkin, but makes it difficult for smaller groups, and women of colour,  organizations especially, to do their work and  plan for future stability.  She is also greatly disappointed that the  Liberals failed to live up to promises to do  something about violence against women. "Despite the "blue ribbon' federal panel report on  violence against women and a recent Statistics  Canada telephone survey which revealed what  we already know—that most women experience violence—there is nothing in the budget  that addresses this issue in a serious way," says  Larkin.  Fawzia Ahmad of Women Against Violence Against Women (WAV AW) and Tina Bains  of Vancouver's South Asian Women's Centre  agree. "What's the point of spending millions of  dollars on these task forces if government is not  willing to allocate money to the groups who are  working to end violence against women?" says  Ahmad. "We consider this a slap in the face."  Adds Bains: "This is very unfortunate because violence against women is a real problem  in our society. Women are battered and educa-  (VJelTTheri's your'  (happyIWD card'  .sorrsjfs)  iat'e  Also destined to create considerable  pressure is the government's decision to  cut UIC benefits. Like others, South Asian  Women's Centre coordinator Bains is  highly critical of such a move during a  timeof record unemployment. "I squirmed  when I heard that because it's very hard to  find a job right now and there is little job  stability for those who are working. I think  many people will have to resort to welfare  again," says Bains.  Linda Marcotte of End Legislated  Poverty (ELP) says a good percentage will  be women working in low-paying service  and retail sectors prone to layoffs and  firings. She is equally concerned that UIC  changes have created a two-tiered system  of "deserving and undeserving" recipients.  mT. government  tion alone isn't the answer. Women need concrete support services."  Even worthwhile budget initiatives offer  limited benefits to women, NAC and others say.  Cuts in defence spending, the reinstatement of  the court challenges program (designed to assist  organizations fighting for Charter of Rights protections), and the creation of commissions on  women's health care, prenatal nutrition, law  reform and race-relations, are positive moves,  but do not address the serious economic problems faced by women and children.  Similarly, it remains to be seen how many  parents will benefit from the creation of additional childcare spaces. As Penny Coates, a  childcare activist and member of the BC Daycare  Coalition points out, it depends on how much  money is allotted for operating costs. "This is  critical because while it's important to create  more spaces, most families can't even pay for  services available now," says Coates. "Operating dollars must go directly to the service providers so that user fees to parents are affordable."  The budget freezes and cuts to federal transfer payments, could make it tough for provinces  to meet childcare cost-sharingrequirements. BC,  Alberta and Ontario could experience the most  difficulty thanks to a one-year extension of the  five-percent cap on Canada Assistance Plan  (CAP) payments to these provinces. The cap  means the federal government will cover only  up to a five per cent increase in education, health  care and training expenses, regardless of the  true cost.  "Freezes or reductions put extra pressure  on provinces," says Coates. "In BC, the Canada  Assistance Plan cap means there will be no  additional money for post secondary education,  which means the province is less able to train  adequate numbers of childcare workers."  \lOOM^  The new rules require individuals to  work 12 weeks instead of 10 to collect  benefits, reduce the number of weeks of  benefits, and impose a two percent cut in  benefits for most recipients. A; the same  time, roughly 15 percent of recipients have  been designated "low income" and will  receive a three per cent increase (about  $12.00 per week), provided they have  dependents and earn $390 net or less per  week.  Not only does this 'divide and conquer' attitude set up hatred and division  among poor people, says Marcotte, but  she and Larkin add that, since a large  number of the "low income" group will be  single mothers, eligibility could become a  serious problem. They wonder, for example, if women will have to prove they have  no spousal support and if so, will that  mean a return to the "man under the bed"  scenario (women must lia| if they are living  with a partner who may be, or could be  considered capable of providing income  support).  And, they say, the requirements spell  danger to Canada's system of universal  social programs. "This is j ust the first shake  at it and what it amounts to is a means test.  Never before has UIC b6en connected to  individual status," says jLarkin. Another  danger sign is denying sleniors who earn  more than $25,900 net per- year from claiming the age tax credit. "before all seniors  got the same benefits and then some were  clawed back. Now, we have a means test.  This is what the government wants—to  end universality."  WAVAW'sFawzia Ahmad agrees and  says tampering with universality will be  particularly harmful to women, many of  whom already live at or below the poverty line. "This will be an additional oppression and those who are already  marginalized the most—poor women,  First Nations womens, lesbians, differently abled women, women of color—  will suffer the most."  "Governments  are always  talking about  reducing deficits,  but  they fight deficits  on the backs  of the  most vulnerable."  Adds ELP's Marcotte: "This budget  is a key indicator of where the Liberals are  going in terms of social policy, especially  since before the social program review  even starts [see page 8], they are cutting  UIC and freezing transfer payments. It's a  cynical slap in the face to any kind of  democratic process."  As the federal government continues  to cut back on social spending, thus making it more difficult for provinces to provide adequate funds for job training and  education, the number of people on welfare will go up, says Marcotte. And the  tougher the times, the greater women's  burden. "It's women who are expected to  take up the slack. They look after the kids,.  the older people, and keep communities  going. Governments are always talking  about reducing deficits but they fight deficits on the backs of the most vulnerable.  You never get over a hunger or a health  deficit."  What's also scary, she says, is that  while government hacks away at social  programs, thebudget included an increase  to the charitable tax donation~an indication that the Liberals want charities to do  more of the work government should be  doing. "They tell us to take any job, make  do, be flexible, and then help wealthy  people get rid of some of their guilt by  contributing to charities."  For Marcotte, it is critical that anti-  poverty, women's and labour organizations fight to preserve the country's social  safety network. "We need to be involved  because the gains we've made are being  lost."  Larkin agrees and says NAC's main  focus for the year will be developing a  feminist vision of social programs. To that  end, one day of the April NAC BC regional conference (see announcement in  Bulletin Board this issue) will be devoted to  discussion of a vision and action strategies. Any woman who belongs to a NAC  member group is welcome and encour-  aged to attend the session.   Jackie Brown is a freelance writer living in  Vancouver.  APRIL 1994  KINESIS News  New changes to welfare policy:  Debunking media myths  by Erin Mullan   The BC government's changes to welfare policy are concessions to media myths  about people on welfare, according to End  Legislated Poverty (ELP).  In the wake of extensive media coverage about welfare fraud, the provincial government announced a number of changes to  welfare policy in late January. These included forcing single employables and childless couples to fill out job search reports in  order to get welfare, and to line up to pick up  welfare cheques. Single parents are now  considered employable when their oldest  child is 12 years old, rather than 19.  "I think the changes were made not to  respond to welfare fraud but in response to  Demonstration outside a welfare office in Vancouver  [alleged] charges made in the media and by  the Liberals," says Jean Swanson of ELP.  "The government response was a bad response because it played into myths about  people on welfare, and the myth that there  are oodles of jobs out there."  Swanson says a better response would  have been to raise the minimum wage and  increase welfare rates. "We'd like to see the  government stand up for people on welfare  and expose the myths, instead of caving into  them."  On February 23 people from community organizations joined welfare lines  around the province in a show of solidarity  with people on welfare. They handed out an  ELP newsletter explaining welfare changes.  Swanson says people in the welfare lines  were glad to see the show of support. "It was  really good to get so many community  groups to go out and show solidarity with  people on welfare."  Part of the campaign involved getting  welfare recipients to sign letters to premier  Harcourt sayinghow humiliating it is to line  up for welfare. The letter alsojpoints out the  futility of job search reports-which essentially require welfare recipients to collect the  names of employers who dorf t have jobs to  offer. It calls for the governmtjnt to generate  jobs instead. (According to Statistics Canada,  BC's unemployment rate in January of this  year was 11.2 percent.)  Swanson says people were very willing  to sign the letters, but she adds that there are  not many avenues of protest open to those  on welfare. "It's not as though you can go on  strike."  The letter to the premier also points out  that according to Ministry of Social Service  statistics for 1993, there were 6,879 welfare  fraud investigations which resulted in only  132 people bei ng cha rged .That works out to  about 4 out of every 10,000 people on welfare.  "If we're going to talk about fraud then  let's look at the big boys instead," says  Swanson. She cites two recent cases where  individuals were convicted of $15 million  and $17.5 million in tax fraud. Neither case  received the kind of media attention accorded to stories of welfare fraud.  Swanson says that this kind of media  double standard means many people think  welfare fraud is a serious concern. She adds  that the nature of the coverage is driving the  NDP government's response to the issue.  Everywoman's Heath Centre:  Fighting  harassment  by Erin Mullan  Staff and clients at BC's first free-standing abortion clinic continue to face regular  harassment by a small number of anti-choice  protesters.  In recent weeks the doors of  Everywoman's Health Centre have been  blockaded twice. During one incident the  anti-choicers splashed the entrance of the  clinic with blood.  The handful of blockaders, most of  whom have previous convictions for blocking clinic doors, were later arrested.  Everywoman's Health Centre spokesperson  Kim Zander says the on-going harassment  does not stop the clinic from operating.  There is an injunction against protesters  blocking the doors, but Zander says the  sentences received for blockading don't seem  to be acting as a deterrent.  "The other difficulty is that it is still  taking police a long time to respond to our  calls when the blockades occur," says Zander.  She adds that because the police and the  crown have failed to stop the harassment the  clinic has to try to sort out the situation.  "On the legal front we are looking at  going back into court to strengthen our injunction. Our legal council is looking at our  options," she says. "We are also looking at  alternatives that have been put forward by  the pro-choice movement elsewhere, including a province wide injunction which would  protect clinics as well as staff, including  doctors providing abortions."  Another possible source of relief could  come from the recommendations of the provincial task force on abortion and contraception. Zander says that the provincial government should receive the task force's recommendations at the the end of March, and she  hopes the report will be made public soon.  Many of the submissions received by the  task forces addressed issues of safety and  security.  The recent splashing of clinic walls with  animal blood by protesters was an act of  desperation, and an attempt to create "an  extreme atmosphere to get media attention,"  says Zander. "Most people find these type  of antics pretty repulsive, and I don't think  that they win people over by that type of  dramatics."  She adds that the police had a creative  response to the situation, which was to call  in the fire department to hose down the  outside of the clinic.  On another front, the provincial government is now negotiating funding with  Everywoman's. In late January the clinic's  board put out an appeal for support, saying  proper funding had been repeatedly delayed. Zander says the appeal was successful.  "The public support that the clinic received after our call to our supporters to put  Women's Studies by Distance Education  Athabasca University now offers a Bachelor of Arts major in  Women's Studies that you can take entirely by distance education.

Ash  The Canadian women's magazine,  Healthsharing, has ceased publication, and  Pandora, Halifax's feminist newspaper, may  soon follow suit. Lack of finances and volunteer bum-out are cited as reasons for their  difficult times.  Healthsharing's Amy Gottlieb says the  closing down of the magazine has been a  "difficult process." A letter was sent to subscribers after the last issue came out in November 1993, informing them of the closure.  Without paid staff at the magazine, says  Gottlieb, it was harder send out a press release or set up a news conference to ensure  the wider community knew what was happening.  . "There are different models out there,"  she says, "but it would require a complete  turnaround in Healthsharing's organization;  for example, working out of women's homes  rather than a central office."  Herizons, a national feminist magazine  published in Winnipeg, has expressed an  interest in having more coverage of health  issues, says Gottlieb. Herizons itself folded in  1987, and was revived in 1992.  Kinesis, on the other hand, continues to  be the oldest, regularly publishing national  feminist publication in Canada, due in part  to its ongoing drive since 1986 for financial  self-sufficiency, ongoing restructuring, and  its relationship to the Vancouver Status of  Women, which publishes Kinesis and provides the paper with financial and administrative support.  "Healthsharing has not been  the only casualty...  most Canadian magazines  have been hard hit by the recession,..  [and] the free trade agreements."  m *m i nf*i»i iiiiii»i »mniam m»m d»»m tmm\  Healthsharing began publishing in 1978,  covering health issues from a feminist perspective. Recent issues have focused on women's health in Atlantic Canada and the prairies, the politics of breast cancer, the formation of the Canadian Women's Health Network, and the North American Free Trade  Agreement's effect on universal medicare.  Gottlieb says Healthsharing has been  struggling since funding from the federal  government was cut in 1990. The Conservative government cut funding by 100 percent  to all feminist publications it funded, as well  as core funding to women's centres and First  Nations media. After protests and occupations of government offices, some funding  was reinstated to women's centres, but not to  the publications.  Since 1990, readers have rallied to support Healthsharing with letters and money.  Gottlieb says the readers "kept Healthsharing  alive" untii a grant from Health and Welfare  Canada came through in 1991. The grant,  which was for the support of a Canadian  Women's Health Network, was transferred  to Healthsharing since the organizations that  had originally applied for it were no longer  functional. This funding recently expired,  and Healthsharing could not find any other  source of core funding. It is not eligible for  arts or health funding, as it doesn't qualify as  an arts publication or as a health service.  Gottlieb believes reader support can only  act as a temporary support measure, especially given the economic situation and its  impact on most women, whichhas worsened  since 1990. Ongoing costs, such as printing  and postal rates, have also increased.  Gottlieb says workers at Healthsharing  were "worn down" and demoralized by the  combined work of putting out the magazine,  fundraising, and their ongoing political activism. She acknowledges that some publications, such as Herizons and Kinesis, manage to  survive without core government support.  will likely be a "Best of Healthsharing" compilation of articles, although a final  decision has not yet been made. The book is  scheduled to come out this fall. "We didn't  want Healthsharing to disappear without a  trace," Fitzgerald points out.  Healthsltaring has not been the only  casualty of the rough 90s. Publishing alternative magazines is a risky business in  Canada. Most Canadian magazines have  been hard hit by the recession, regressive,  the paper are needed to ensure the publication of the quarterly.  She says it has become harder to find  volunteers, since the recession has meant  that "a lot more people are caught up in  survival mode." She notes that the Nova  Scotia W/N (Women's Information Network)  has also recently had to close due to lack of  volunteers.  Another major reason for Pandora's possible demise is the enormous financial, emo-  "Though Kinesis pays for itself by revenue generated by the paper, a big reason for  its survival has had to do with VSW's invaluable support without any strings attached,"  says VSW's Fatima Jaffer, staff member responsible for Kinesis. Jaffer says it is written  policy that VSW continue its support of the  paper but maintain an arms-length relationship, to ensure the paper's political and editorial independence.  "Another reason for our survival is that  Kinesis hasn't faced the same problem of lack  of woman power to do the work. More  younger women, women of colour, First  Nations women, poor women, and lesbians  continue to join the movement every day and  Kinesis tends to be among the first places  they check out."  Whataboutthefuture of women's health  advocacy?  "Healthsharing came out of a movement that has changed and grown," says  Gottlieb, in that it had begun to broaden its  health coverage by "addressing issues like'  poverty and racism."  "That movement is still there [even with-  out Healthsharing]...there are numerous  groups at the local and provincial level, working on issues such as breast cancer, violence,  and alternative therapy."  However, says Gottlieb, Healthsharing  provided a national voice on women's health,  and this is now gone. It also provided a  venue for women who didn't consider themselves professional writers to be published.  There will be a "wake" for Healthsharing  sometime this spring, and women who have  been involved in the magazine are invited.  Gottlieb says it may also be an opportunity to  "figure out a way to rebuild" a Canadian  women's health magazine.  Meanwhile, The Women's Press in Toronto is now working on a book on  Healthsharing. Maureen Fitzgerald, a member of the editorial collective, says the book  Healthsha  anti-Canadian publishing policies of the  Tory government, the free trade agreements,  and the backlash against progressive and  feminist movements in North America.  National feministpublicationsthatcon-  tinue to publish tend to be subscription-  driven, solicit advertising, rely on extensive fundraising schemes, be volunteer-  run, and publish on shoestring budgets.  Lately, feminist publications have begun to spend more time devising fund and  support-raising strategies that include  working more closely with sister publications, such as sharing subscription-drive  costs, exchanging advertising in efforts to  broaden readership bases, and holding joint  fundraising benefits.  Despite all this, women have seen the  demise of several long-running feminist  and progressive publications in the past  few years, including Rites, the Canadian  gayandlesbianpublication out of Toronto,  and the British publication Spare Rib in  1993.  Now, Pandora, the feminjstnewspaper  in Halifax may also have tb shut down.  Judith Da vies, a worker withjthe all-volunteer newspaper, says a shortage of woman  power is the main reason. Da vies says more  than the four women currently working on  tional and physical costs of defeating the  human rights challenge brought against the  feministpaper by aman whose letter Pandora  refused to print, in keeping with their  woman-only policy [see Kinesis May 1992,  July/August 1993]. The case dragged on from  1990 to 1992, during which the Nova Scotia  Human Rights Commission sent the complaint to a board of inquiry. Pandora won,  but the case and the fundraising that was  required to fight it exhausted many women,  says Davies. Women became dis-spirited  and dropped out, and new volunteers did  not take their places.  Pandora recently put out a newsletter in  Halifax with a "plea for help." Although  several women have expressed interest in  joining the collective, no one has yet committed to doing so, so Pandora is still "in  difficulty," says Davies, reporting after an  emergency meeting to discuss Pandora's future, held as Kinesis went to press.  Some women have discussed starting a  new paper. Davies says she is "pretty sure a  paper is going to come out of Halifax some  time-whether it will be Pandora or not is the  question."  Sliannon e.

Glaucoma Study  The Canadian National Institute for the  Blind (CNIB) announces the largest study  ever undertaken in Canada on glaucoma.  Glaucoma affects one out of ever 100 people  over the age of 40 in Canada and is the  second largest specific cause of blindness in  Canada. Approximately 112,000 Canadians  are estimated to suffer from glaucoma. Elevated pressure inside the eye (intraocular  pressure) is the most important known cause  of glaucoma. Science is still lagging on concrete evidence regarding other causes of  glaucoma.  The $1.5 million study, funded by the  CNIB's EA Baker Foundation for the Prevention of Blindness, will involve researchers from four major Canadian universities  and will focus on other possible risk factors  for contracting glaucoma, such as vascular  diseases.

Conference on AIDS  2-Spirited People of the 1 st Nations and  The Native Canadian Centre of Toronto will  co-host the 3rd Canadian Conference on  Aids and Related Issues in the Aboriginal  Community this year.  The conference will take place in Toronto, Ontario, and is tentatively scheduled  for November 3-6.  The theme of the conference is "Aboriginal People Completing The Circle," and  is intended to build on the work of the first  two Canadian Conferences on HIV / AIDS in  the Aboriginal Community, which focused  on raising awareness.  The organizers hope this conference will  draw the largest gathering of Aboriginal  people living w>th HIV/AIDS in Canada to  date. The focus will be to address issues of  prevention, education and interventions, as  well as issues such as HIV and tuberculosis,  human rights, and traditional interventions.  Workshops will be run simultaneously during the course of the conference. In addition,  plenary sessions have been planned to bring  cohesion and focus to the theme of the conference.  The Planning Committee of the conference is working on preliminary logistics,  and a Conference Co-ordinator has been on  site since February.

NAC launches  membership drive  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) has launched a  membership drive to attract new members  to the organization.  The main reason for the drive, according to NAC's newsletter, Action Now, is the  urgent need for a strong national women's  organization in Canada.  "The economic re-structuring of  Canada has unleashed a backlash against  the gains made by the women's  movement...Help usbuild a women's movement in Canada, and ensure that our strength  continues with the number and diversity of  the groups we represent."  To have a new member kit sent to a  group who has not yet joined NAC, call  NAC's membership coordinator, Andrea  Ritchie, at 1-800-665-5124. For more information, contact NAC at 57 Mobile Drive,  Toronto, Ontario, M4A 1H5, or call (416)  759-5252; or fax at (416) 759-5370.  Intercede marks  10th anniversary  Last month, Intercede, the Toronto-  based organization for domestic workers'  rights, celebrated its tenth anniversary.  Intercede Service Unit was founded in  1984, to provide a space from which to organize around issues specific to domestic  workers in Canada.  Four years before, domestic workers  had launched a year-long intensive campaign to pressure the then Liberal government to end the temporary work permit  system. Under this system, foreign domestic workers had no right to apply for landed  status in Canada.  By the end of 1981, the government had  acceded to the demands of the workers and  workers had won the right to apply for  permanent residence from within Canada  through the new Foreign Domestic Movement program. However, the program still  forced foreign domestic workers to stay on  temporary work permits for a period of at  least two years.  Even before Intercede got government  funding to rent an office space, domestic  workers were already addressing inquiries  and problems to the active members of Intercede.  When the Client Service Unit opened in  1984, workers finally had a physical space to  go for information and couselling about their  immigration, employment and other social  service needs.  Intercede is presently located at Suite  402,489 College Street, Toronto, Ont, M6G  1A5. The organization produces a monthly  newsletter called Domestics' Cross-Cultural  News, available free to Intercede members  and non-profit organizations, or at $20 a  year for non-member domestic workers, and  $25 for others.  Intercede also holds monthly meetings  at Cecil Community Centre, 58 Cecil Street,  Toronto, as well as clinics, workshops and  other services relevant to domestic workers.

Anti-Norplant lobby  DES Action Canada is organizing a campaign against the use of Norplant in Canada  following the recent approval of the contraceptive for use in Canada [see Kinesis, Feb  94].  Norplant, a high-tech contraceptive, was  approved for use in Canada without consultation with Canadian women.  Norplant requires women to see a doctor to both implant and remove the device.  This dependancy on doctors has already  presented problems for women in countries  where the implant has been tested and in use  for several years now. The lack of widely  available information on Norplant in Canada  and elsewhere, means women cannot give  their fully informed consent to have the  implant placed in their bodies. Women in  the US, Brazil, Indonesia, Bangladesh and  Kenya have had their requests for removal  denied by doctors who told them to wait for  the side effects to subside.  According to the Population Council,  the implant's developer, women ask to have  the implant removed after three-and-a-half  years on average.  ra  COYLE & CHARLES COUNSELLING SERVICES  CYNTHIA   R.

Initial consultations ere without charge.  Norplant's active ingredient,  levonorgesterol, has profound side effects  for many women. Up to 95 per cent of  women on Norplant have experienced uncomfortable menstrual irregularities, headaches, fatigue, acne, and decreased libido.  Some womenhave gained weight—which is  significant because Norplant's contraceptive effect decreases in women weighing  more than 70 kg, raising the risk for accidental pregnancy and fetal exposure.  DES is also concerned that Norplant, as  a contraceptive, is being used by women  before studies into the long-term effects of  its active ingredient have been completed.  Norplant has only been in general use for ten  years, which is not long enough for long  term effects, like cancer, to arise.  DES-exposed Canadians represented by  DES Action Canada point to previous experience of the negative consequences of seemingly benign drugs that may take years to  surface. DES, (diethylstilbestrol) was a synthetic estrogen given to women until 1971 to  prevent miscarriage. Women who took the  drug are now at increased risk for breast  cancer, and their children have contracted or  are at increased risk for reproductive system  cancers and infertility.  DES Action is asking the Minister of  Health, Diane Marleau, to ensure that women  choosing Norplant as a contraceptive are  given full information about its risk and side  effects, and adequate time with a health  practioner to discuss potential risks to their  health. As well, DES Action is calling for a  nation-wide follow-up system to be put in  place for women with Norplant to provide  post-marketing surveillance of Norplant's  effects, and to remind women of the need to  have the implant removed after five years,  even if they have moved to a different province.  DES Action is also demanding that the  drug approval process be opened up to the  public so Canadians may know before a  drug is approved what evidence the manufacturer submitted supporting its safety and  efficacy, and which researchers considered  the application.

Support for  South Asian lesbians  Sakhi, the first visible lesbian group to be  set ;up in India, is asking for support from  feminist organizations globally in the form of  contributions for their resource centre.  Sakhi is requesting any appropriate videos, books, periodicals and donations of  subsciptions to women's and lesbian publications.  Sakhi is also asking for letters of support  or anything that will help promote lesbian  visibility in India.  Sakhi was initially conceived as a network, bringing lesbians together through let-  ters^, as well as by creating a platform for  issuing statements, critiques of lesbophobia,  and other such activities. In October, 1992,  Sakhi created a lesbian resouce centre-cum-  guestroom. Sakhi also organizes video showings with lesbian themes, and are a forum for  lesbian artists, activists, and researchers to  exhibit and talk about their work.  While the Sakhi collective has been in  existence for three years, it has not yet received any acknowledgement or support from  any Indian feminist organization. Collective  members say there is a persistent and suffocating lesbophobia in the denial of open lesbian spaces by Indian feminist groups.  As well, Sakhi organized the first five-  day seminar on gender construction and alternate sexualities last December, which was  co-sponsored by Naz Project, based in London, England. As a result of the conference, it  was decided that an archive of historical  resouces on alternative sexualities in South  Asia be developed, and that Sakhi will conduct the feminist lesbian research.

Film on  Women and Aging  Canadian filmakers Andrea Gutsche  and Barbara Chisholm are calling for older  women to participate in their documentary,  "The Revenge of the Invisible Woman."  The filmmakers intend to highlight the  strengths and freedoms that come with age,  as well as the difficulties and regrets that  older women experience. They say the film  will be "funny, uplifting, insightful, and  inspirational," and will renew the spirit of  older women who remain invisibile in mainstream Canadian society.  The filmakers are looking for women  from across the continent, and from a variety of cultural, economic, and religious backgrounds who have interesting stories to tell,  and who are willing to share their experiences on film. The issues they identify as  important are: menopause, love and sex,  and new goals, as well as women who have  found individual ways to respond to societal stereotypes around aging; women for  whom this period has given them new  strength; and women whose lives have taken  new and unexpected directions.  Gutsche and Chisholm previously have  collaborated on Talking Back, which documents highschool stereotypes, and Toronto:  Stories from the Life of a City, made for the  CBC.

Network for  Muslim Women  Women Living Under Muslim Laws  (WLUML) is a global network that links  together women whose lives are shaped,  conditioned or governed by the laws drawn  from the Qur'an or stemming from local  traditions. WLUML aims to dismantle women's isolation from one another by emphasizing communication among individuals  and organizations.  It concentrates on women living in countries where Islam is a state religion, or where  Muslim communities are ruled by relgious  minority laws. It also includes women living  in secular states; women in migrant Muslim  communities in Europe, the Americas, and  Australasia; as well as non-Muslim women  who have Muslim laws applied to them or  their children.  Acknowledging that Muslim women  come from diverse backgrounds, the organization does not attempt to impose a particular ideology, or a single set of political objectives. Rather it focuses on encouraging  women living in different parts of the Muslim world to work out their own strategies of  emDowerment appropriate to their situations. Support is provided through information, ideas, training, personal contacts, and  solidarity.  WLUML has been in existence since  1984.

Muthoni Wanyeki  Lobby against  female circumcision  On International Women's Day, the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women  (CACSW) presented 24 recommendations to  the federal government for action against the  practice of female circumcision in Canada.  "We believe that female genital mutilation  is a form of violence against girls and women  which violates their basic human right to bodily integrity," Glenda Simms, CACSW's President explains. "The federal government must  take a leadership role in ensuring that female  genital mutilation is not practised here. As  well, our recommendations are intended to  ensure that women suffering the long-term  health consequences of female genital mutilation are treated appropriately in Canada."  CACSW says these recommendations  were prompted in partby the inflow into Canada  of immigrants and refugees from regions where  female circumcision occurs. Their recommendations also follow the outlawing of the practice in other Western countries such as Sweden,  Norway, Belgium, the UK and France at the  urging of African women within these countries.  The CACSW recommendations include:  specific legal measures against the practice;  improved immigrant and refugee integration  programs; directives to health service providers, education and social service providers and  professional heath associations; as well as a call  for funding for women's groups working on  the issue from the Women's Programs department of the Ministry of Human Resources and  Labour.  •that the federal government draft specific legislation against the practice of female  genital mutilation  •that the federal government recognize  the importance of adequate integration  programs...in particular for the equality and  safety of immigrant and refugee women and  girls  • that medical and nursing schools in hospitals and universities train doctors, nurses,  nurse practitioners and midwives to recognize  associated symptoms and health effects and  provide appropriate and sensitive treatment  and assistance  •that community health centres be  equipped to deal with female genital mutilation and its medical and social consequences in  a culturally-sensitive way  •that the federal Women's Program encourage funding applications from grassroots  and women's organizations to provide educa-  tionand support for families affected by female  genital mutilation -and that those provincial  and territorial colleges of physicians and surgeons that have not yet issued any statement  against female genital mutilation do so.  CACSW notes its recommendations "attempt to balance respect for cultural  variation...with the recognition that some cultural practices are oppressive towards women."  However,concernhasbeenexpressedthat  the criminalization of female circumcision may  lead to women performing it in their homes,  driving the practice underground.  "Criminalization, as opposed to education, is dangerous," says DegaOmar, a Somalian  woman who works at a women's crisis and  counselling centre in Vancouver and who has  worked with other African women on female  circumcision within their communities. It  could result in the jailing of immigrant women  who may notbe aware of the change in the law,  leaving their children to the state and breaking  up their families."  CACSW's position that "female genital  mutilation is more likely to be perpetuated  where immigrantand refugee communitiesare  ghettoized and remain unfamiliar with Canadian custom" has also raised some concern.  "Women from communities which practice female circumcisionhasfoughtagainst this  practice for a long time and have made in  roads," says Omar. "The assumption that we  need to assimilate to eradicate the practice is  wrong."  The recommendation urging funding applications from grassroots and women's organizations has met with positive response.  "Immigrant and refugee women's organizations, working against the practice from within  their communities, should be encouraged to  apply," states Omar. "They are doing the work  and that work should be funded."  The Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons  in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario already have clear position statements against  the practice of female circumcision by doctors  in those provinces. So far, the federal government has been reluctant to respond to CACSW's  recommendations, stating that female circumcision is already covered by existing criminal  legislation against child abuse.  Omar sees this approach as dangerous  and agrees with CACSW that any legislation  must be specific. "The equation of female circumcision with child abuse does not acknowledge the context in which ithappens. Effective  work against the practices of excision and  infibulation takes that context into account."

The review, announced by Minister of Human  Resources and Labour Lloyd Axworthy in  January, is expected to "radically overhaul"  social programs in such a way as to "reward  effort" by those in need of social assistance.  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) is calling on women  across Canada to play anactive role in ensuring the review and any reforms recommended by government committees represent the best interests of women.  NAC's says women could be severely  affected by proposed reforms because the  government, in the name of "modernization," is in reality proposing cuts to some of  the services (including medicare, unemployment insurance and welfare) which most  affect the well-being and equality of Canadian women.  "As social programs are eroded, the  brunt of previously-funded work falls into  the domain of women's unpaid labour.  Women pick up the shortfall in child care,  care for the elderly and care for the sick,"  says NAC's newsletter, Action Now. "As the  funding to women's shelters is cut, women  are less and less able to leave violent family  situations. Because women's employment  situations tend to be less stable than men's,  women are deeply affected by the erosion of  the unemployment insurance and welfare  programs."  Lynne Toupin of the National Anti-  Poverty Organization adds that Axworthy's  rhetoric around rewarding the efforts of the  unemployed is also cause for concern. However, she says, the notion of linking social  programs to job creation is a positive.  Meanwhile, a Parliamentary Standing  Committee and a Ministerial Task Force will  be advising Axworthy on social security  reforms. The Parliamentary Committee intends to consult the public at "a broad level."  The Task Force, which consists of five women  and nine men, and is concerned with specific  "solutions," will not be producing a report,  not holding public consultations, nor receiving briefs from the public. It will be working  solely in consulta tion with Axworthy to produce an Action Plan to be presented to Par  liament in April. The Action Plan is intended  to be the basis for "widespread consultation  with the public" this summer.  Women are being encouraged to share  their experiences resulting from changes in  social programs, both at the federal and  provincial levels, with NAC and other women's groups. NAC is also attempting to link  up with organizations who have done or are  doing research or developing policy positions on the overhaul of social programs.

Taxing child support  Suzanne Thibaudeau's challenge of a  court decision that requires her to pay a sex-  discriminatory tax on child-support payments is presently at the federal court of  appeal stage.  Thibaudeau, a single mother from Quebec, is challenging the 1992[decision of a  Quebec Tax Court that required her to pay  tax on the monthly child support payment of  $1,400 she receives from her ex-husband to  support their two children. Thibaudeau owes  about $8,000 plus interest and penalties on  taxes dating back to 1988.  Revenue Canada requires the recipients  (mostly women) of child support payments  to pay taxes. Those who make] the payments  (mostly men) receive a tax break. This tax is  oftennot taken into consideration at the time  when divorce agreements are worked out.  The effect is that single mothers end up  carrying the tax burden, while the men end  up functionally paying only a portion of the  agreed upon amount of child support, in  addition to getting a tax break-  Thibaudeau's lawyers argue that the  government's taxation system discriminates  against her on the basis of sex, marital status  and socialcondition, thus violatingher rights  under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In Thibaudeau's 1992 case, Judge Alban  Garon ruled that the tax was not unfair. He  insisted that when courts set the amount of  the child support payments, they do not take  into consideration the impact of the tax.  Therefore Revenue Canada does not discriminate against single moms. In the event  that the tax is not taken into consideration,  he said it remains nevertheless a concern of  the Family Court system,'and not the Tax  Court system.  Thibaudeau's appeal lawyer told the  Court of Appeal's three-judge panel that  Garon had made a mistake in not considering the "kitchen table" nature of divorce  proceedings, where divorcing couples often  make agreements without the advice of legal  or tax experts. He suggested that, due to the  complexity of the tax system, there was no  guarantee that even if the couple sought  professional help that the presiding court  DR.

Meanwhile, Brenda Schaff, a North  Vancouver woman who lost a case similar to  Thibaudeau's 1992 challenge, is also appealing the decision against her.  Downtown Eastside  activist dies  Janice Saul, an activist of the Lil'wat Nation, died in March. She was well-known in the  Downtown Eastside as a woman who took a  deep interest in helping women in trouble on  the streets. She marched to protest the deaths of  First Nations women from drug overdoses,  talked many women out of living on the streets,  and encouraged young pregnant women not  to drink. Saul, 44, was found dead in her apart-  mentafter an eveningofsocializingwith friends.  Her longtime friend, Leith Harris, says,  "Janice saw too much, she heard too much, she  had seen too many women die, but there was  nothing she could do about the root cause of the  pain, the racism and colonial oppression of the  Native people."  Saul's mother, Mary George, says her  daughter was a helping person who often lent  money to people even when she didn't have  enough forher own groceries. Saul was a kitchen  worker at the Carnegie Centre, and an organizer of children's parties. She grew up near  Mount Currie and graduated from high school  in Sechelt. She is survived by her mother, her  20-year-old son, Warren, and many friends and  activists.  IHIIIIMIIIIMl  San gam Grant R.P.C.

V0S 1E0  KINESIS  APRIL 1994 Feature  ElectionsinSouth Africa:  Women take up challenge  by Sunera Thobani   South Africa's first-ever universal elections  take place on April 27-30. Last November, a five  member Canadian delegation spent two weeks in  South Africa observing the pre-election preparations, noting obstacles to the elections, gauging  what kind of outside support would be needed,  and determining the participation of women in  the election work.  Sunera Thobani, the president of the National Action Committeeon the Status ofWomen,  was a member of the delegation. She spoke last  month at a forum in Vancouver organized by  Oxfam Canada on violence, the particular obstacles that women face, and the achievements of  women in South Africa as the country moves  towards the elections.  Her presentation aired during Black History Month on Vancouver's Co-op Radio (CFRO  102.7 FM). The producers placed the piece in  Black History programming by noting that, "because things are changing so rapidly in South  Africa, many South Africans in Vancouver are  hesitant to comment on the current situation.  Also, very few people can access the broad range  of people, organizations and parties that the delegation was able to when it was there."  I'd like to start by saying I am not from  South Africa, and that I am not speaking for  any of the women's groups in South Africa. I  amSouth Asian, born in Tanzania, and I was  in South Africa last November for only two  weeksaspartofOxfam's delegation. I would  like any of the South African women in the  audience to share in this forum, and to feel  free to add their comments to the discussion.  It was an exciting time to be there. The  multiparty negotiations were taking place  and things were changing almost daily.  We met with a fair representation of  people: representatives of each of the major  political parties; activists from women's organizations; activists from community organizations; lawyers; professors; women from  the rural areas—a fair cross-section. We also  travelled a fair bit. We went into one of the  homelands, Natal, Johannesburg, Cape Town.  But we were only there for two weeks and  that's too short a time to really get a sense of  what's happening in the country.  What we heard across the board wa s that  the level of violence in the country poses the  greatest threat to carrying out the elections.  And everybody, again across the board, expected the level of violence to increase leading up to the elections.  When the issue of violence was raised,  only women's groups talked about violence  against women. The representatives from  the political parties, most of whom were  men, talked about the general level of violence but showed a great reluctance to address the issue of violence against women.  Yet that was a big concern for many of the  women we met.  The violence that was talked about was  state-sponsored violence: violence on the part  of the South African police and the South  African defense forces; violence between the  ANC and Inkatha activists; and violence  within the townships. These were all identified as political violence, whereas violence  against women was defined as private, domestic, not political violence.  Outside South Africa, there is a tendency  to equate all the different levels of violence  which exist in the country. We need to be  careful in doing so, because apartheid was  maintained through violence. There is not  only a quantitative difference, but a qualitative difference when we are talking about  state-sponsored violence. Equating all levels  of violence is a mistake. I would also argue  that you couldn't equate violence against  women with other levels of violence, but it  still needs to be addressed.  Outside South Africa, there is also a  tendency to focus on tribalism—not just in  terms of South Africa, but in terms of many  African countries—so thedifferences which  exist between the ANC and Inkatha are  described in tribal terms. That is a stereotype which needs to be challenged. There  are clear political differences between the  two parties. Weare told thatlnkatha represents the Zulu Nation, and that the ANC  doesn't—yet there are many Zulus who are  One of the obstacles women face is not  having the necessary identification to vote.  We heard that voters would need their passbooks, their identity cards to vote. Yet, historically in South Africa, there have been  campaigns against thecarryingof these passbooks . Also, many of the women work in the  informal sector and so these passbooks are  not things that they necessarily need or would  have. When we met with representatives  from the government, they said that only 13  percent of the people in the country did not  have the necessary identification to go out  ANC supporters as well. It's too simple and  completely misleading to represent the fighting taking place between the ANC and  Inkatha as being based on tribalism and  ethnic rivalries.  Therearealsostereotypesaboutwomen  in the different communities. In South Africa, whenever we talked about patriarchy  and sexism, the automatic assumption was  that it was only in the Black community that  we needed to do so—"of course, it doesn't  exist in the white community, it's only in  the Black community." At other times, it  was the Indian community in South Africa—"because their culture condones the  oppression of women, and the men are  traditional." It was as if there was no sexism  or were no patriarchal relations in the white  community. Those stereotypes need to be  challenged. Sexism and patriarchal relations are the result of power inequalities  which exist in all communities in South  Africa, whether it's the Black community,  or the coloured community, the Indian community, the white community. Racism exists not only in South Africa, but everywhere else, making it very difficult to put  gender relations in the appropriate context,  and understand them as power inequalities  rather than reducing them to cultural or  racial stereotypes.  Since coming back from South Africa,  I have also noticed the assumption that,  with the releaseof Nelson Mandela, and the  unbanning of the ANC, apartheid is over—  "the only problem is that South Africa is late  on the path to democracy and we must try  and 'help' them become democratic." We  forget the whole history of apartheid, its  whole legacy. But when you are there in the  country, even for a short time, you recognize how deeply entrenched racial inequality is. It distorts the reality of the situation  to talk about apartheid as if it's over.  and vote. Yet, we heard from NGOs and  women's groups that the figure was closer to  40 percent. There were discussions about  issuing voter cards on the spot during the  elections, but all of that was very uncertain at  the time we left.  In the highlands, there was also concern  about the actions of members of the Freedom Alliance, the right-wing alliance which  includes some white fascist organizations,  the Inkatha party, and two of the homelands. When we were in Bophutatswana,  one of these homelands, we heard that the  leader of Bophutatswana had said that he  was going to set up the tanks so that the  people in that area could not cross into South  Africa, over the arbitrary boundaries between the homelands and the rest of South  Africa, so as not to allow people to go out  •and vote. [Since then the leader of  Bophuthatswana has been ousted, and people in the homeland will participate in the  elections. However, registration of voters is  expected to be difficult to achieve by April  26th.] Although on the day that the voting  takes place, you might be able to provide  protection for the people, what about the  period leading up to the election and what  about immediately after the election? How  could you ensure the safety of, people in this  area, particularly for the women, because a  lot of the men have come doyvn to work in  theurbancentres.Proportiona}ly,largenum-  bers of women live in rural communities, so  the threat of women being intimidated is  very great.  I don't want all of this to sound depressing because there was a lot that women's  organizations were doing that was encouraging, given the difficult circuimstances. The  most exciting thing was seeing women's  groups prepare for the elections.  There is a group which puts out a feminist paper called Speak Magazine. They also  do a radio show which broadcasts weekly.  When I was there, they had already started  raisingwomen's issues and profiling women  candidates who were running for the elections. They define themselves as non-partisan and their focus was on issues they wanted  answered, issues such as where the various  parties stood on abortion rights, childcare,  women's employment, etcetera.  There was a voter-education program  run by a woman who works with the South  African Council of Churches. She was going  into the townships and talking with women,  outlining all of the symbols for the different  political parties, showing what the ballot  would look like and trying to do the voter-  education in a non-partisan way. It is necessary information, because someof the women  had never seen a ballot before.  While we were there, the ANC also  announced that.33 percent of their candidates were going to be women. This was a  major achievement for women in the ANC,  and even with the most conservative estimates, they may well end up having more  women in Parliament than we do here.  Another significant achievement occurred in the struggle for land rights. When  we were there, the interim constitution was  being negotiated and some of the traditional  leaders wanted to make the constitution  subject to customary law. Women argued  very strongly against that because customary law bars direct access to and control over  land women. Ultimately, the constitution  was felt to be supreme and it was decided  that customary law could not supersede  that. This wasa major achievementof women  in the land rights movement who had pushed  the ANC to take that position.  When I was leaving, I heard that a  number of women who are ANC activists  were planning to put out a leaflet saying  what rights were guaranteed in the interim  constitution. They were going to flood their  communities with these leaflets to inform  people of their rights.  A group of women I met in Johannesburg said, "this is not the important election,  it's the next election which is going to be the  real election that we are preparing for."  The idea outside the country that there  isn't a level of politicization is very misleading because South Africa is one of the most  highly politicized societies that there is today. People have simply been denied access  to information about their rights and how  they can participate in the struggle.  I also went to the beach in Durban and  met two young women who work in a home  for Black and Indian children who've been  abused or poor children who've been abandoned by their families and taken into care.  The women said, "a few years ago, we  couldn't even come onto this beach because  there were laws which would prevent us  from doing so. Now, we just march our  children onto the beach and they can play  where they want to." It really put things into  perspective for me. No matter how deep the  problems are and no matter how long a  process its going to be to really have democratic transformation, there are steps which  have been taken, which people have fought  very long and very hard for, which make a  difference in people's lives.

APRIL 1994 Feature  Feature  Palestinian Women and the 1993 Palestinian-Israeli Agreement:  Peace—not just another     piece of paper  by Hanan Elmasu   The role of women in a society whose  political position has remained volatile for  many years is usually overlooked when flipping through the pages of political history.  The struggle of Palestinians for their legitimate rights for self-determination is no exception.  A "peace agreement" has been struck  recently by representatives of the Palestinian people and the state of Israel (see box re:  Sep. 1993). The agreement has been met with  criticism and mixed emotions on both sides,  and has yet to prove itself as being the precursor to a "just, lasting and comprehensive  peace." Amongst Palestinians in general,  emotions have run high when contemplating the ramifications of the peace agreement. Many have voiced their opinions about  the peace process but rarely do we hear any  analysis of the peace process from a woman's perspective.  I recently had the opportunity to sit and  talk with five Palestinian women about their  views on the peace agreements, how it has  changed things for women in the occupied  territories and how it might change them in  the future. The women—Hedy Ghattas,  Ekeen Ghattas, Hi yam Diby, Basima Aljousy  and Hala Elmasu—have different herstories  but they contain a common factor—dislocation. Hedy moved to Canada with her husband over 20years ago becauseher husband  was not allowed to re-enter Palestine after  thewarofl967.Ekeen,whoisHedy'sdaugh-  ter, grew up primarily in Canada. Hiyam  was on vacation in Europe when the war of  1967 broke out and was denied re-entry into  Palestine. At the age of 16, she was separated  from her parents and family and left to  roam, as were many other Palestinians.  Basima, a school teacher in Palestine who  suffered numerous humiliations after the  occupation, left for Canada to escape the  oppressive system that was taking form.  Hala was studying on a student visa in San  Fransisco and was also denied re-entry into  Palestine after 1967. None of the women left  their homes by choice: they were forcibly cut  off from all that is familiar.  Within the warmth of Hady's kitchen  and the hospitality and laughter of our  Arabic culture, I asked the women about  their thoughts on the recent peace agreements.  Hedy Ghattas: What peace agreement?  This 'peace' is just a piece of paper. What I  see is a contractual agreement. A contract is  not exactly a peace treaty. There is no peace  deal—on the surface, it may look like it, but  it really isn't there. I don't believe Israel is  sincere,and [PalestinianLiberationOrgani-  zation chair * 'asser Arafat] was driven to  the table for a number of reasons, mostly  economical. Or maybe he wanted to feel  good for one day, because that is all it was:  one day. For one day, the world was  surprised...the photo opportunity for [US  president] Clinton was great, and the  hesititation of [Israeli prime minister] Rabin  to extend his hand to [Palestinian Liberation Organization chair] Arafat was apparent.  We must remember, Israel was driven  to the peace agreements; they didn't walk to  it. Arafat was in the same boat. Both worked  for the same purpose: to stop the growth of  the revolution [intifada] within the country,  a revolution growing not from the older  Palestinians, but driven by the children.  When I went to Jerusalem in 1967, I saw  children from my school standing atop the  walls of old Jerusalem not with guns, but  with stones: today, 30 years later, I see their  children up on those same walls.  The Palestinians didn't lose their country, they lost their country for the British  [who were administering it—and then they  experienced American imperialism. Now,  history is repeating itself. We Palestinians  were never prejudiced against the Jews. We  were only hoping for someone to give us  our autonomy.  In my eyes, [the peace agreement of  September 1993] is just a piece of paper.  There are too many footnotes to the clauses  of the agreement to make it acceptable: you  can drink water...if we open the taps; you  can have police...but only if they report to  the Ministry of the Interior in Israel. This  really is no deal.  Also, Israeli policy is based on a so-  called democracy—sometimes you see it,  other times you don't. In Israel, there is  segregation and many other inequalities between Palestinians and Israelis. As well, Israel's economy right now is based predominantly on war. If the war machine was  dimantled right now, they would have a  massive economic problem. Peace wouldn't  pay economically for Israel.  Then again, the opponents of the agreement are too strong. Even with an evident  bias towards Israel in the agreement, many  Jews are protesting its implimentation. It is  not a durable agreement. The democracy of  Israel is a dictatorship within a democracy  and it is very unstable. The government of  today may be for the peace agreement, but  who knows what will happen after the next  Israeli elections? The agreement could mean  nothing with the change of government.  Finally, water resources are too scarce.  The existing water resources cannot continue to support the great influx of Jewish  immigration. And it cannot absorb the 15  million Palestinians who dream of returning  to their homeland.  Hala Elmasu: When they Said we have a  state [when the peace accord was signed], I  was ecstatic. I put up a [Palestinian] flag in  my window and even thought of selling my  business and going home. But when you  think about it longer, you hit the reality of  the agreement and it's bitter. I would not  have the rights that I should have in a democracy, and I would be under someone's  control at all times. They've given away all  the areas of Palestine that they don't want.  It's not fair to thosePalestinianswhosehomes  are in Haifa, and other places they cannot go  back to.  Hanan Elmasu: Would you ever go back  and resettle?  Hiyam Deeby: For what? I would love to  but, right now, what would I do? What are  the prospects for my children there? To let  them dream again as I did, to hope they were  born in a peaceful country; or for me to  forget what I suffered for 45 years. I don't  want my children to suffer what I suffered.  Hanan: Would you ever see yourself, as  someone born in Palestine and raised in  Canada going back to live in Palestine? [directed at Hedy's daughter, Ekeen].  Ekeen Ghattas: I think women have come  a long way, not just in the Middle East, but  everywhere. There was a time when women  couldn't be in the workplace, couldn't smoke  in public. Now we're doing all that. But I  don't think I could live with the mentality  there. If I went there and said half the things  I say here, I would be persecuted. Before the  Intifada and the revolution, women were  oppressed. Now they are suppressed. Here  you can speak up about what is bothering  you to some extent; there, if a soldier looks at  me the wrong way, there's nothing I can do  about it.  Now if I were anlsraeli woman going to  live Jerusalem, I wouldn't encounter that.  They have the same rights there as they  would here. But the minute I got off the  plane, my rights would be taken away from  me. Yet I think if there is truly peace, I should  be able to feel the same way there as I do  here.  Hanan: What do you see for the future?  Hedy: The prospects for more trouble  are there in the short term. After a while,  people get tired of the same thing. When  people get tired, they have to do something.  Why work so hard to achieve so much when  someone may change their minds the next  day about what's written on a piece of paper.  Trust must be developed between the  two peoples before anything positive can  happen. It has been over 40 years that there  has been this great mistrust between the two.  Itcannothappenovernight.Butjustice should  prevail. The only justice I see is to go back  and see what everybody lost and deal with  each individual. There has been much pain  and suffering and many atrocities. I call it a  'modern holocaust'. But it cannot go on  forever.  Hanan: In the media here, the only  woman we saw involved in the peace process was Hanan Ashrawi. Is this an accurate  representation of women in the Palestinian  struggle?  From 1948 to 1994: a brief history  May. 1948: Jewish settlers proclaim the state of Israel.  1949: Armistice Agreement divides the Palestinian State; about half is annexed by  Israel; the rest is annexed by Jordan or administered by Egypt.  1956: Israeli-French-British invasion of Egypt.  1964: The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) is founded.  Jun. 1967: Israel invades Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Israel annexes the Sinai Peninsula  and Gaza Strip from Egypt, Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank and East  Jerusalem from Jordan.  Nov. 1967: UN Security Council passes Resolution 242, calling for immediate Israeli  withdrawal from occupied territories, recognition of all states in the area, and just  settlement of displaced Palestinians (refugees).  1969: Fatah gains control of the PLO and Yasser Arafat becomes chair of the PLO.  1973: Egypt and Syria invade Israeli-occupied Sinai and Golan Heights. The  invasion lasts 17 days. The UN Security Council passes Resolution 338 calling for a  ceasefire, implementation of Resolution 242, and negotiations for a just and lasting  peace. Israel continues occupation of Sinai, Golan Heights, Gaza Strip and the West  Bank.  Sep. 1978: Egypt, Israel and the United States sign Camp David peace accords,  offering limited autonomy to Palestinians in the occupied lands. Israel continues to  refuse to negotiate with the PLO.  1979: Israel returns Sinai to Egypt but continues occupation of the Gaza Strip.  June 1982: Israel invades Lebanon. In September, Israel occupies West Beirut. The  Lebanese Christian militia kill upto 2,000 Palestinians (mostly women and children) in  Sabra and Shatilla (camps holding refugees of the 1948 war) while the Israeli militia  guard the camp gates and refuse to allow Palestinian women and children to escape.  Dec. 88: Intifada (uprising) in the West Bank and Gaza Strip begins after an Israeli  Army truck deliberately crashes into two vans bringing Palestinian day labourers from  Israel home to Gaza, killing four Palestinians. This is said to be in retaliation for the  shooting of an Israeli businessman in downtown Gaza city three days before.  1989-1993: US attempts to direct peace negotiations between the state of Israel and  the Palestinians.  Jan. 1993: Israeli parliament lifts ban that made contact with PLO members a crime.  Israel still refuses to negotiate directly with the PLO.  Aug. 1993: Israel says it will negotiate with PLO if PLO scraps sections of its charter  calling for extermination of terror and renounces terror. PLO says those chapters have  been null and void since December 1988.  Sep. 93: Israeli-Palestinian accord signed amid heavy fanfare. The pact calls for  Israeli Army withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip towards limited "autonomy" with Jerico as its capital.  Mar. 94: US-born Israeli extremist kills 28 Arabs in Hebron mosque. Israeli soldier  kills one Palestinians outside mosque, and soldiers kill five Palestinians outside hospital  where wounded are taken.

Hedy: No. There were many others but  they did not recieve as much exposure as  Hanan Ashrawi. There were not only women  on the bargaining table, but also in the refugee camps working hard to bring about peace.  Hiyam: If you go into the camps, you'll  see that it is the women who are educating the  children. They are involved immensely in the  war as well, fighting alongside the men seeking self-determination. It is a fact that the  ratio of women to men in Palestine is increasing greatly. It is now women who are going  out into the workplace, running households  and becoming 'super-women' with their activities because of the increasing mortality  rate of men because of the war. It is predominantly women who have taken over the education and social aspects of the younger generation.  Basima Al]ousy: There are also a lot of  Arab and Jewish women who are coming  together to try and bring about peace. It was  the women's groups that first began to even  whisper the word "peace."  Ekeen: I think women are bearing the  brunt of all the war. It is a strong woman who  can allow her children to go out in the intifada  to throw stones and quite likely never come  home. It is more than any woman can take to  lether child go out and die for a cause and say  it'bokay.  Hedy: Intifada has [given opportunities  to] women to become more educated, allowed for more freedom of speech and has  given women much more involvement in  social spheres. The women are doing the  ha rdest job in the war. Before, women were  giving birth to children just to send them  out to war. That is no life. It is suffering.  Nowwomenareputtinganendtoit.Women  were oppressed by the system. In Islamic  history, it was women who were the warriors and the heroes. There is a common myth  that Islam subjugates women and denies  her her freedom. But before the religion  came to be, women were being buried alive  and abused immensely. What we see right  now in fundamentalist aspects is not true  Islam. Itis the government thatstates that in  Saudi Arabia women must not go out  without veils, cannot listen to music because it comes from Satan and so on. It is not  the religion, and women are realising it  more clearly each day.  Basima: When the Israeli's took over in  '67, they came into the school where I was  teaching, they threw us outside, made us  kneel down, put our hands on our heads for  hours on end, and answer all kinds of questions like "where's your father, your brother,  what are you doing here?" They put us  through so much humiliation. In Jerusalem, we were treated so badly. Being a  teacher at that time, they forced us to study  the Hebrew language, and [if you wanted]  to be a teacher, you were no longer allowed  to teach in your own village. As a Palestinian, there was no way that, socially, I could  go out on my own to a small village without  my family to go and work. But there was no  alternative. Now, women will risk persecution in order to teach their children. When  the schools were shut down, women would  meet illegally to teach. They went on [teaching], and that is admirable.  Hanan: Do you see any good coming out  of the peace agreement?  Hiyam: There is always hope. Even  though now it is not as we would like it, it is  a first step. We fought this long and so hard  that we cannot turn our backson any chance  to end the pain and humiliation. It is up to us  now to make it work and fight just as hard  for a peace that will allow all to be equal.  All the women I talked to have lived  their lives wishing for peace! in what they  know as home. Perhaps that rjme has come.  There is still a long and difficult path ahead  of them but they are doing their part. The  women are all members of i group called  Palestinian and Jewish Womefr for Peace, as  am I. We have been members for almost  three years. We meet every month and discuss different issues that concern the Middle  East. Each meeting brings us closer to understanding.

But in  India, communalism is tied up with religious bigotry and right-wing definitions of  community-sticking up for community,  defined on the basis of religion, versus all  people, or community versus class. Class  politics are wider and include Hindus, Muslims, and Christians-all people or national  politics that have a notion of a liberal democratic state for all are short-curcuited by  communalism. Communalism leads to the  creation of countries on the basis of religion.  Communities in India are indigenous  communites, so there's no question of sticking up for your own-your own exists all  over. You don' ttalkaboutlittle ethnic groups  because this isn't about an ethnic group in  India; it's about 13 percent of the indigenous  people-the largest Muslim presence anywhere in the world.  Jaffer: You're talking in sheer numbers,  because there's the whole Middle East as  well.  Bannerji: Yes, but no Middle Eastern  country, no country in the world has as  many Muslimsaslndia. You're talking about  12-13 percent in present-day India, minus  Bangladesh, minus the area that is Pakistan,  and it's still the largest Muslim concentration in the world. So if your community is  the whole country, community politics in  that sense does not make sense. The dalit (the  untouchables caste) community politics  might be called community politics, but it  will never be called communalism. Communalism came to be an euphemism for  standing for your own religious grouping,  for a state founded on the basis of religion.  This is why the Muslim League and the  Hindu Mahasabha would be considered  communal politics, because they would  name the political subject as being religious  identity, not a social, national, economic  identity.  This is why "communalism" is a bad  thing-it means somebody who wants no  single state, someone who does not believe  in the rights of all workers, someone who  first defines people in terms of religion, then  defines politics and exclusivity on the basis  of that.  Jaffer: How does caste fit in to this?  Bannerji: Caste is one of the definitions  in what we are talking about, but caste politics didn't arise like that. We'll leave that  aside fornow. Let's lookat fundamentalism,  which is aga in a reworking of religion. When  a group of people decide that they know  what the true fundamental meaning is, they  become the fundamental spokesperson for  interpreting [that meaning.] A practicing  Hindu or Muslim can practice religion in  many different ways. Fundamentalism is  not being religious. You can be a practicing  Hindu or Muslim, you don't have to be a  fundamentalist. What makes you fundamentalist is believing that one version is the one  or Muslims and, in the context of India, it's  the (Ulemat's) or the Brahminical castist interpretation of Hinduism parading as the  real Hinduism and the real Islam of the  country.  Jaffer: And it is directed at the non-elite,  the "masses."  Bannerji: Yes, it becomes the representative, the spokesperson for millions of people. It suppresses all the other voices that are  within that religious group and actively  works to put them out of existence.  Jaffer: Where does it get its strength?  H: Well, it doesn't manage to [put other  voices out of existence], fortunately. One of  the problems with Western propaganda  about fundamentalism is that [the propaganda] makes [fundamentalism] into something real. In India, hundreds of thousands  of people disagree with these [fundamentalist] versions of Hinduism and Islam. I have  been in marches where a million people  marched against the destruction of the  Ayodhya mosque [in December, 1992, by  the BJP -Bharatya Janata Party, the Indian  People's Party, one of the Hindu f undamen-  ie version ot Infllfl' as Hindu wasn't  invented by the nationalists.

There's no attempt to highlight the  competing and contesting views inside the  country itself. Part of the strength [of fundamentalism] comes from how it is presented  in international politics and in the international media.  Jaffer: What about Christian fundamentalism?  Bannerji: When you look at the American presidency and its support of fundamentalism in regard to abortion issues, the  "family," or homosexuality, you find that  people like [former US president Ronald]  Reagan gave very solid support to Christian  fundamentalism. When [US president  George] Bush bombed Iraq [during the "Gulf  War" of 1992], he prayed the whole night  with [Christian fundamentalist] Billy  Graham. Why Billy Graham? Yet no-one  made a big issue out of this, or noted that he  supported the American state as a fundamentalist state. But if an Islamic leader had  done that, it would immediately be highlighted in the Western media as fundamentalist and fanaticist.  In the West, Christian fundamentalism,  in direct and indirect ways, has a lot of ties  with state policies, such as the way that  welfare is decided, the way that women are  looked at, the way that abortion rights are  talked about, the way gays and lesbians are  labeled. All this has to do with how these  states relate to moral-majority campaigns  and fundamentalism within their own countries.  Jaffer: And all these things threaten the  economic base, the people who have power,  17th century, the Ottoman  Empire was present all the way to Vienna,  half-way into what is called Europe now. A  whole set of stereotypes in Europe were  invented about the Muslims. It wasn't until  the late 18th century when the English took  hold of Bengal that this became the ruling  discourse: Muslims as the outsider, Muslim  as the invader, Muslim as the fanatic.  The mixture of religions, cultures and  politics in' India that go way back are completely ignored. For example, the fact that  Urdu as [an Indian] language is a form of  Farsi [a Middle Eastern language,] the fact  that the clothes you and I are wearing right  now are of both the Middle East and India, is  .completely forgotten.ThecolOnialdiscourse  ■ of seeing India as Hindu was spread out  very far.  Cultural nationalism from the mid-19th  century picked up this cultural formulation  of India as Hindu. Indian nationalism can be  said to have at least three elements: Hinduism; the liberal democracy oft the West, i.e.  the separation between statd and religion  and a civil state for all; and a quasi-socialist  component from the anarchism, communism and socialism of Europe collapsed into  something called the Fabian socialism of the  Nehruvian Congress. There were different  periods during which different strands predominated. In the late 19th arid early 20th  century, there was a big competition between which strand would get hold of the  politics.  [Mahatma] Ghandi straddled the two.  On one hand, Ghandi did have a religious  kind of understanding and his use of  alsodivided people. Henamed the peoplea;  Hindus, and named the people as Muslims,  gave them an ideological space in his kingdom, but never considered them as producing people of the country who should have  the means of social wealth in their control.  After almost 50 years of Indian independence, about 45 percent of people live below  starvation level. People still own hundreds  of thousands of hectares of land, and that is  considered okay by the state even though,  legally, it is forbidden. But the landless Indian poor cannot challenge a landlord for  owning hundreds of thousands of hectares,  given that also part of the landlord's family  is in the government, makes legislation, and  industrializes India. There's no way people  could ever implement these laws and the  government has no real will to do it.  This is why nationalist slogans on religion talking about economic questions take  hold. This deprivation is volatile and politically actionable. You're not talking about  consciousness and culture, you're talking  about complete and utter deprivation, starvation, the selling of women in markets, the  selling of children in markets, the labour of  five year olds, the dispossession of people to  an extent where cities have grown to the size  of up to 16 million people because the countryside is totally and completely devastated  and controlled. "•m^m^imtimmi  The left organizing in India has jeen  internally weakened and externally bashed  inby the statepowers,a powerful, Draconian  imperial state which has inherited the colonial machinery. [The government] didn't  dismantle it, but reinforced it. The state has  one of the largest standing armies in the  world-an army that does not often go and  do things to other nations, but works on its  own people. India has five kindsof well-  trained, and well-funded police.  Again, their main target is the poor, the  "unruly" and the "ungovernable." The British called Indians ungovernable, the rich  now call the Indian poor ungovernable. The  government has also dismantled a lot of  people's organizations and continually  threatened popular, class-based, anti-state  organizations of any kind.'^PT^P^^^HSt  Ideologically, the left has never really  addressed the question of culture, not be-  The Mandal Commission actually had a  vvay.of creating solidarity among the people,  which was very inimical to the interest of the  right.  People were then called back into the  [right-wing's] folds in the name of being  Hindu, or Muslim, creating big hegemonic  blocks that can be pitted against one another.  Huge riots followed. The media's rule has  also been lethal in the communilisation of  Indian life and politics. The media got captured by Hinduization, by history programs  that they used to run [on TV] and still do. One  [program] was a complete Hinduisation of  Indian history, done by historians who were  Hindu fundamentalists themselves. The Muslim rulers and any benevolence in their eras  [of rule in India] was completely forgotten as  were many facts of Hindu history, or that  language and cultural things, like dances,  were a combination of Hindu and Muslim  cultures. What was left in place was the image of continual invaders coming to India.  Then camethedramatization of the Ramayattfl.  They interpreted the text—it's 18 volumes  thick, so you can pick out of it anything you  want and what they picked out was patriotic,  militaristic, paternalistic, patriarchal and  casteist. The areas where the Ramanaya was a  well-read text among the rural peasantry is  the area where the heaviest fundamentalist  campaigns happened.  The south has still not been affected by  this Sangh Parivar onslaught because the  south has its own anti-Brahminical politics-  popular consciousness is more against the  Brahmins than the Muslims.  When you look at all the different levels,  you begin to get the scope, contradictions and  complexities of the situation. Modern Indian  poverty and the incredible political and economic crisis that India has been in over the  last 10 years, has given a rich ground for  communalism and fundamentalism.  In Bombay, where riots never happened  between Hindus and Muslims until now, the  areas targeted were where Muslims live. Lots  of Muslims right now are low-income people. The tailors, handicraft workers,  day workers, etcetera live in this slum where  Hindus and Muslims have lived since the  partition [of India in 1948]. The riot didn't  happen between the slumdwellers, the riot  happened against the slumdwellers by upper-income housing estates and the police.  In February, 1993, this riot left quite a lot of  people dead and the area was completely  devastated. Basically, they were trying to  get rid of people from the slums to take over  the property.  There is a good bookcalled Khaki Shorts,  Saffron Flags that talks about the organization of the RRS (Rashtrya Sawyam-Sevak  Sangha, the National Volunteers Association which is a para-military political party)  and BJP. It traces the roots back to the early  19th century, showing their interplay with  Indian politics and economics as the years  go by, culminating in the present state. It's  absolute complicity with foreign capital and  Hindus or ordinary Muslims. You can periodically stir them up but you can't keep it  going.  And the fact that [right-wing, fundamentalist parties] failed electorally [in the  last elections] in the places where they generally formerly had strongholds makes me  think that there may not be as solid a ground  as they think.  There has been a lot of civil protest. As  well, there has been a lot of political protest  coming from the Leftist parties, not just  communist, but other progressive and left  parties. Trade unions have also been very  active. Women's groups have played an interesting grassroots role in the opposition.  Some,whoaredirectly party-connected have  By saying that  [feminism is] not Indian  ignores the hundred years of women's struggle  and male reformers  who were pro-women's rights.  absolute anti-protest stand inside the country. They have used this idea of foreigner/  invader against anything that looks barely  progressive, ranging from being anti-trade  union, anti-Communist Party, anti-women's organizations, anti-civil rights, or anything that is even vaguely tolerant of class-  politics. Everything is named as foreignism  and therefore not nationalism.  Feminists, for example, arebig enemies  of the Hindu nationalist fundamentalists  because they aje foreign in their ideology.  That means obviously Hinduism means the  domination of women and whoever says it  doesn't must have learnt it abroad. By saying that's not Indian ignores the hundred  years of women's struggle and male reformers who were pro-women's rights. The  ideology of Mao and Marx and so on are  foreign too, so whoever's Lenin's son or  Mao's son is basically an enemy of the state  and of society.  Fundamentalism is also masculinity; it  attaches itself securely to the patriarchal  organization of a few thousand years and  valorizes that. A man who is a killer is a  hero. A man who disagrees with killing  Muslims becomes a feminized man. That's  that way men who are anti-communal are .  described, as not being men. The heroic  man is this Brahminical casteist, militaristic, patriotic and patriarchal man-in other  words, it is the elevation of a killer kind of  masculinity.  Jaffer: So where is the opposition to this  coming from? You say there's a strong opposition; what is it and where are women in  this whole equation?  Bannerji: There is a strong opposition.  This is where I think alternate media-be-  cause the mainstream media of the West  will never do it-has to highlight the fact  that hundreds of thousands of people have  not agreed to [the fundamentalist agenda.]  For example, there have been all kinds of  groups of Muslims and Hindus together  fighting the aristocracy inside their own  communities.  The present riot-mongering has also  had littleappeal. The unsettlement or disarrangement of people's lives hasn't pleased  people. Yes, there are short bursts of violence, but there's no desire for a long term  bloodbath on the part of either ordinary  held their own campaigns. But those who  are not [connected to a political party] have  done campaign work on the ground.  As a whole, it's not game-over by any  means. I don't believe we will see a Sangh  Parivar India in the next 10 years, which is  what I thought was likely two years ago. In  areas that were former BJP strongholds, there  has been a lot has been written by various  groups, and the marches and the demonstrations and so on that have taken place  have lead me to think this is by no means a  settled and concluded story. It's not over yet.  The role the West will play will be very  crucial in that a lot of people are sending  money to India for the Sangh Parivar cause.  The American establishment has given it  some support as well. They were expecting  these [parties] would gain power [in the last  elections]—the parties do support a "free  market," privatization, foreign capital, and  so on and, at the same time, maybe have a  way to crush class and popular protest in  India. The West wanted the BJP to prove  themselves, and the BJP did not prove themselves as effectively as the West wanted  them to, so I'm not sure whether Western  support is as strong as it wasln 1990.  However, the project of opening up  India [to the West], which combines privatization, foreign capitals, lack of reserve bank  laws, and so forth, may now have attached  itself to the [leading] Congress Party and  may have found in Congress it's true ally. I  believe Congress has jockeyed some of the  forces of Western capital to itk side.  The repression that the Congress can do  is sufficient unto itself. The labour movement is being effectively targeted by the state  and by new economic policies: where wages  are down, real wages are fallirlg, trade union  protections are beginning to bf eroded away  and breakdowns in the trade|unions in different sectors is happening ahd so on.  There are many ways to skin a cat-there  are more roundabout, circuitous and structural ways of disorganizing a country than  having to have a big ideological, national  agenda. It's perfectly possible; in the coming  10 or 15 years that, [while] we may not see a  Sangh Parivar government, we will see periodic upsurges of this kind, and coalitions  forming between Congress and the BJP, for  example. [They had a coalition] before this  riotious time, and they can do it again and  again, pulling in and pulling out. In a way,  that is more effective in terms of socio-economic disarrangement-what is called structural adjustment in India-than having a  national, sewn-up ideology against which  people can actually rise up in a concerted  way. Right now, you're fighting 10 battles.  And your energy is being dissipated in all  directions. But if you can make [the battle]  one, we could be more effective because  groups could join together. Instead, what is  going to happen is strategy of confusion, of  assault by erosion, rather than a kind of full  assault.  At the same time, I don't think the women's politic that's rising in India is a negligible politic at all. At present, thirty percent of  politica 1 sea ts have to be reserved for women  from the village government level, all the  way to the top. That means the vote of  \vomen and their political participation has  become a big catchment area for every political party. [As a result,] there's a very strong  demand for women's rights, women's necessities, women's basic needs, and so on,  from the ground level and then all the way  up. And this electorate [of women], and  these political officers are not going to be so  easily captured by the BJP-VHP, even if BJP  and VHP did have a women's wing and  tried, in a modifying way, to give certain  kinds of rights to women.  But they fall short when it comes to  issues of property, freedom of women-abortion in India has been legal since the 50s.  There is now abortion on demand by constitution, but there was an attempt to rescind it  on the part of these parties—that has not been  taken kindly to by women. So this is a major  political wrench in the works.  Jaffer: Do women actually fill that 30  percent of seats?  Bannerji: Yes, the quota gets filled, less  at the national level, but more and more and  more every year. And in the villages of West  Bengal, for example, the village election is  important. Eighty percent of Indian people  still live in the villages of India, so the village  government is not negligible. It's the conduit  between the state policies and the local people. It has a hand in irrigation planning,  marketing, street distribution, trucking of  things, and the levy policies of grain by the  state. Village government is a powerful instrument and has been captured in most  places in West Bengal by the left. In other  places, it's by mixed groups of people, but  women, somehow, instinctively have drawn  more to the left and to progressive parties  than to the right. It's a life instinct really.  Women don't have to read a book about  what leftist policies are; they live the experience of having seen the Congress before,  having seen the Hindu Sangh Parivar element in their countryside.  We're at an interesting time where the  organized politics of the left may have become weaker in some ways, but the popular  politics from the [grassroots] has become  stronger. Where this formation in the end is  going to go, no:one knows-it's a complicated and important time in India's history,  probably as important as around the time of  the independence movement and partition.  My hope lies on the ground, really, with the  women, with popular politics as well with  the left parties.  .

There was no paid  advertising and the women who worked on  the more adminstrative aspects of the paper,  for example, circulation, were not acknowledged in the Staff Box.  The paper was still being mailed through  the Vancouver Status of Women's West 7th's  offices, rather than through a mailing house,  as it now is. The most immediate post-production task was to hand-stick the address  labels and stamps, and tape-close each of the  hundreds of papers mailed each month. The  final step: deliver the stuffed bags to the  main post office...and then, start working on  the next issue.  The major focus of the April/May issue  was a 12-page supplement on pornography  and prostitution, written by Jillian  Riddington and Barb Findlay. The supplement provided an extensive overview of  issues around prostitution, and argued that  the law is only interested in pushing prostitution because the "...visibility of prostitution illuminates the sexual barter common  to most sexual relationships."  The supplement examined: how male  and female socialization provides a foundation for prostitution and noted a link between sexual abuse and prostitution; the  history of prostitution law and police entrapment; th. coercive nature of pimping;  and argued that prostitutes are "...workers,  but the nature of [their] work causes them to  be oppressed even more than other workers." The authors call for decriminalizing  prostitution arguing recriminalization  would eliminate "the hypocrisy, class bias  and sexism now so obvious in the law."  The pornography article described the  range of sexually explicit material available  in Canada and attempted to define erotica  and pornography. The coverage argued that  "Erotica celebrates our humanity and sexuality. Pornography denies and denigrates  both." and took a stand against sado-masochistic practices which allow "no possibility  of equality between the sexes," (ignoring the  possibility of gay and /or lesbian sado-masochistic practices.)  The authors reviewed the censorship  versus anti-censorship debate and came  down in favor of censorship in situations  where pornography limits women's freedom. Finally, Canada's (then) current law  and the government's law reform efforts are  reviewed and found wanting, since neither  distinguished between erotica and pornography. Feminists are urged to take direct  action against pornography by marching,  picketting and boycotting.  The supplement reflects what has always been one of Kinesis' strengths as a  forum for a comprehensive review of important women's issues and emerging feminist analysis. Interestingly, feminist analysis  onprostitutionhasnotchangedallthatmuch  since 1979. Pornography, however, has remained a difficult and divisive issue. While  the discussion has become more complex  and enriched by the perspectives of a broadening community, the differences amongst  feminists, and between feminists and others,  Getting ouselves a women's building  Special 12 page feature on  Prostitution and Pornography  are still serious, as they were in 1979. These  days, few attempts are evert made to bridge  our differences on pornography.  Other news in the April/May issue included the first call for women to organize to  purchase a women's building. As some  know, the efforts didn't succeed and a lot of  rent has been paid by a lot of Vancouver  women's groups since then. Support was  sought for the Simon Fraser 18—eighteen  AUCE union members and their supporters—who were arrested after throwing up a  picket line at Simon Fraser University. Conditions at the Oakalla Prison for Women  were reported as deteriorating after a crackdown on women prisoners who had organized demonstrations and sit ins. An extensive article on women and childbirth  focussed on the medicalization of childbirth  and how women can regain power over  childbirth.  Vancouver's Black community demanded action from Vancouver City Council against disco owners who barred Black  patrons. A commentary piece argued, yet  again, that there is "no monolithic lesbian  sensibility." An international feature described Iranian women's struggle for equality and highlighted demonstrations where  Iranian feminists rejected both the then Shah  of Iran's "modernization" campaigns, and  the Ayatollah Khomeini's conservative fundamentalist version of Islam.  A report on the National Action Committee on the Status of Women's annual  general meeting focussed on a broad range  of policy issues, and criticized Ontario's  domination of NAC, and NAC's middle-  class membership and focus.  Mary Daly's Gynecology: The Metaethics  of Radical Feminism wasglowinglyreviewed,  and Marge Piercy, feminist poet and novelist, Cris Williamson, 1970's *i*r of the women's music movement, and Judy Chicago,  the artist who gained fame, or notoriety as  the originator of cunt-centred art, were announced as coming to Vancouver in May.

APRIL 1994 International Women's Day 1994  by L. Muthoni Wanyeki  Over 600 women turned out for Vancouver's annual International Women's Day march and rally on  Saturday, March 5,1994. International Solidarity was the theme of this year's celebration of women's struggles  and organizing.  After the short march from the Queen Elizabeth Theatre to the Vancouver Art Gallery, speakers from  various women's communities spoke to the issue of international solidarity, making connections between  women's oppressions here and women's struggles the world over.  The speakers included: a woman from the Iranian Feminist Association; Zari of the Independent  Federationof Refugees; Akiko Carver, a Seattle-based Japanese lesbian who spoke at last year's gay and lesbian  March on Washington in the US; Julie Dekelv'er of the Red Willow Circle, a support group for Aboriginal  people in the West Coast Mental Health Association; Hanadi Loubani of the Union of Pales*nian Women  Associations in North America; Theresa Netsena of the Aboriginal Women's Council; and Vivian Sandy,  Aboriginal woman activist and key organizer of the annual Vancouver march to mourn the deaths of women  who've been murdered in the Downtown Eastside.  The situations of Palestinian and Aboriginal women were raised. Both groups of women are adversely  affected by vastly disproportionate rates of employment, mental and physical states of health, and life  expectancies as a result of the on-going occupation of their lands.  The trials of women living under a state based on Islamic law, were also raised, placing into question the  immigration and refugee policies of Canada, which are supposed to allow for claims based on gender  persecution.  Women also spoke of the systemic racism behind the make-up and inherent to the operations of North  American militaries. Those who would see women's participation in the military as a victory in equality rights  were challenged.  Sawagi Taiko, Vancouver's all-women taiko group, performed during the rally, as did Vancouver-based  gospel singer Penny Singh.

Arts  Review: Nice Rodriguez' Throw It To The River:  Machismo & the modern girl  by Lai Two   THROW IT TO THE RIVER  by Nice Rodriguez  Women's Press  Toronto, 1993  The short stories in Nice Rodriguez' collection are mostly sad and sometimes funny.  They touch on the experiences of a number of  Filipina butch dykes, living both in the Philippines and in Canada. At this level alone, it  is an empowering book, since, although there  are a number of Filipina dyke writers who  have been circulating work for a while,  Rodriguez is the first openly Filipina Canadian dyke to do so.  Rodriguez was about 30 years old when  she immigrated to Canada in 1988. In the  Philippines, she had been a writer for top  business papers in Manila, and drew Marcial,  a daily anti-Marcos comic strip that was published in Malaya (Freedom). (Ferdinand  Marcos was the long-time, right wing dictator of the Philippines at the time.)  Lput off writing this review for quite  some time because I was not sure how, as a  Western born lesbian of colour, I could critique what seemed to be the sexism in  Rodriguez' point of view. It was difficult to  find an anti-racist space from which to critique because white Western feminists, for  long, critiqued the cultures of many so-called  Third World countries as sexist, from an inherently racist standpoint.  In the end, I decided it is important for us  as lesbian writers of colour to provide one  another with honest critical feedback. It was  ridiculous to let myself be caught in a quandary between my feminism and my anti-  racism. Further to allow this dilemma to prevent me from discussing the book would only  feed into racist strategies of fragmenting the  identities of lesbians of colour.  I realize that in a lot of ways it puts an  unfair level of scrutiny upon Nice Rodriguez,  who as one of very few Filipina dyke writers  in this country, is providing images for which  Asian lesbians have been starving. Like it or  not, by the very virtue of being a pioneer in  this kind of work, Rodriguez bears a great  deal of the burden of representation. I was  conscious of reading the book as just one  experience among many, but I must admit it  was difficult-part of a learning process which  not only my mind, but also my body needs to  absorb. In the same way that I recognized the  challenges faced in my own reading, I recognized Rodriguez' in the writing. Her stories  are slices of life. It was important that they  were written by her in her own voice, with  her own sense of what is true.  Rodriguez' humour is largely of the  wry, self-mocking sort which is effective  to an extent. However, I can't help thinking that when a person wants to express  deeply felt feelings that are too painful or  troubling to discuss earnestly, they say it  in a joking way. A Filipina friend tells me  that this is largely her experience of how  Filipinos live with the extensive history of  colonialism and imperialism that shapes  their lives. Is there a way out of this way of  thinking that does not deny who we, as  lesbians of colour, are? Rodriguez' book is  an important first step, in that it consciously  articulates the contradictions in the reality  of some butch Filipina dyke lives—wanting to be a man, and yet wanting to remain  a dyke (and therefore a woman), wanting  to immigrate to Canada and yet not wanting to leave one's lover behind. It seems,  indeed, that Rodriguez' intention is not to  critique, but simply to present a reality that  has seldom, if ever, been written about in  the West and that, in and of itself, is a large  and daunting task. As well, the bravery of  Rodriguez' willingness to be an outFilipina  dyke must not be undervalued.  The main character of each story is a  "butch," with variations on the same set of  macho personality traits.

This means her mother can no  Rodriguez' book is an  important first step,  in that it consciously  articulates the  contradictions  in the reality of some  butch Filipina dyke lives  longer pressure her into entering a beauty  contest.  There is an ironic absurdity to each of  these situations which is the basis for each  story's humour. While no country or character is spared from the author's sharp pen,  too much of the humour occurs at the expense of the Filipina dyke characters. It is  not so much that the butch characters are so  over the top in their butchness, as that the  characters and their situations vary so little  from one another, from one story to the next.  They are always somewhat pathetic, and  caught in a no-win situation. Are they meant  to portray this pathetic absurdity in order to  encourage other women to break out of their  own ridiculously oppressive situations? Or  do they merely reinscribe brutal situations  without offering solutions?  Is this a conscious attempt on the part of  the author to indicate the extent to which  many Filipina dykes are systemically oppressed? Or is she saying Filipina dykes are  categorically caught in a web of narrow  butch/femme stereotypes thatare their lived  reality? If it is the former, then she would do  well to give less power to the forces of  heterosexism, capitalism and'imperialism.  Writing which merely shows the workings  of their oppressive forces without offering  some sort vision, however problematic, of  how women can overcome them is troubling. In Rodriguez' stories, it is only through  WOMVN'S DRESS  ' ■     P.O. box 562,  YEARLY SUBS  (6) ISSUES  the death, damage or departure of a butch  lesbian that any solutions are achieved. If the  latter, then what is she saying about the  desire and agency of her characters?  Most of the stories hinge on sociological  generalizations which suggest that Filipina  butches are born a certain way and that is  that. In "Back Off," Rodriguez writes of  these women: "Sometimes they didn't understand why they hated each other. Instead  of bonding together because society treated  them as outcasts, they perpetuated the cycle  and ostracized each other. At the slightest  chance, they unleashed their own self-hatred on their fellow dykes. Each one imagined she belonged more to the world than  the other." This is the only story that deals  with a dyke who does not fit the macho  stereotype. Instead of having a propensity  for violence, she defers her power to other  butches, to the, homophobic family members of one of her lovers, and to men. In the  end, she dies of cervical cancer.  Not that being the epitome of butchness  does any good either. In "Lesbianita," Little  Ana is a brat. "Her mother says Little Ana  should stop playing with toy guns and cars.  That she should stop drawing a moustache  with her eyebroW pencil. That she should sit  properly with her legs close together and  stop climbing trees." In the end, the feisty  little butch is killed by a passing car as she is  playing in the streets.  In her piece, "Straight People, Wild  Ducks and Salmon," in the lesbian of colour  anthology Piece of My Heart, Rodriguez explains "Macho? Yes. The butch among us  Filipina lesbians really think of ourselves as  men. The Philippines was under Hispanic  rule for almost 400 years and so machismo  has been a part of our social structure. I  wasn't immune to that system.  "Coming from a far-flung country, I  was surprised to see feminsts among the  Asian dykes of Toronto. We, Filipina butches,  were chauvinist pigs in every way. Like the  men in our country, we had fits of superiority. We wished to be served, we wished to be  right. Yet even with these hard rules, our  women stayed."  The butches in Throw It To The River, for  the most part, evidence this way of thinking.  Rodriguez is implicitly arguing two things.  First, culture is a justification for sexism.  Second, it is the fault of colonial rule, over  which Filipinos have no control. Therefore,  the rest of us must merely accept it. To use  culture as a justification for sexism, however, is a trick as old as Adam (so to speak).  It suggests that culture is static. It suggests  that indigenous1 people lack the power of  reason and have no control over their destiny. To cite imperialism as the cause may be  accurate to some extent; however, it unnecessarily gives too much power to the imperialists. It also suggests that Asian cultures  are not sexist, which contradicts her first  assumption.  Throw It To. The River is an important  first step in the representation of Asiandykes  in Canada. Her cutting humour is the kind  that does make you laugh, but it also leaves  you feeling kind of lonely and empty afterwards.  Not long ago I hac1 an argument with  another lesbian writer of colour friend who  insists upon the necessity to represent our  worlds in whatever ways are real to us.  While I agreed that at a creative level this  might be necessary, I will still insist that the  vigorous, well-though out criticism of the  finished work is just as important, and is a  sign of respect.

Among the  topics discussed are women's participation  in the workplace, the continuing disparity in  wages, the impact of new technologies, free  trade and economic restructuring, and the  involvement of women in the labour movement. The authors find that little improvement has been made in women's working  conditions and prospects. Women's access  to nonrraditional jobs has not significantly  improved, and more women are living in  poverty now than in the 80s. The authors  also seek the reasons for these disparities  and look at ways they might be changed.  18  (James Lorimer and Company, Publishers,  1993)  Women Do This Every Day by Lillian  Allen.

Arts  Interview with Helen Mintz:  Through new glasses  by Wendy Putman   "Stories, I have stories," begins Vancouver-based Jewish lesbian storyteller Helen  Mintz, in her performance Jewish Voices of  Resistance, which took place recently in Vancouver as part of the women's performance  festival Women in View. She opens by presenting herself as a weaver of tales, telling stories  to her audience of poor women and servant  girls, maids and factory workers on their way  to their day's activity. She spins a long magnificent tale, within which are embedded  goldennuggets that various women can claim  for themselves.  For the next hour, Mintz wanders the  stage, layering her own subjective voice as a  storyteller over top of the voices of the characters she acts out. These are the voices of  Jewish women.Having actively sought or  developed the stories of women from within  and from outside the "canon" of male-centred Jewish folklore, Mintz' work becomes a  refusal to let women remain hidden, silent.  She gives voice to women whose stories would  otherwise have "passed into the mists of  history." ~  Mintz' resistance is the struggle against  pressure to conform. The expectations of  womenhave traditionally been many: to conform, to society's expectation of the feminine,  to conform to gender-based social roles, to  conform to heterosexuality. There were further expectations of Jewish women: to perform certain roles within the context of family, of upholding the honour of the Jewish  com munity, of keeping the community strong  by living, and making sure their family was  living, good Jewish lives.  There are certain recurring themes a mong  mainstream Jewish tales in the ways they  portray women. Most often, the woman is  someone's wife. Often she has children, although tales don't focus on her roleas mother.  Frequently, she is portrayed as the businesswoman of the family. Sometimes she is portrayed as foolish, at other times, as wise or  wily. In the vast majority of cases, she will  prove successful if she follows a pious path;  if her intent is "greedy" or "immoral," she is  doomed by her actions.  Understanding Jewish folk custom  Jewish tales are a complex genre with a  long, rich history and many branches. During Talmudic times (500 BCE to 1700 CE),  Jewish people tended to conduct their entire  lives in conformity with explicit or implicit  rules, based on scholarly definitions of piety  and enforced in tight-knit communities. Storytelling became the popular purveyance of  Jewish life, with all its customs and usages.  The portraits of women in traditional Jewish  r  i  folktales then, must be viewed through the  primary filter of the storyteller, whose  peroga tive was to teach Jewish people how to  live a pious life. What traditionally set Jews  apart as a distinct culture was, in part, a  contra-distinction to the belief systems of  surroundingnations.Theirstoriesweremeant  to be didactic, a meaning of positive reinforcement for upholding Jewish values.  Much as western literature refers back to  Greco-Roman mythology, the Jewish standard falls back on the Hebrew bible. After all,  as Webster's defines myth as a "traditional  story of ostensibly historical events that serves  to unfold parts of the world view of a people," the Bible could be defined as the mythology of the Jews. Later on were added the sub-  "People in North America have no  idea of the richness of Jewish life and the  culture that was destroyed during World  War II," says Mintz. "As a culture, we are  stopped at the Holocaust, and are very  much still a community in trauma."  This loss of history did not stop with  the decimation of Jewish communities in  Europe. Refugees in North America were  anxious to "fit in." Any autonomy and  status by virtue of being businesswomen  was taken away, as Jewish women were  compelled to adopt a familial role within a  North American nuclear family, and  trained to accept the "inferiority" of their  gender. Mintz sums up this training neatly  when she recalls her thoughts about Miriam  [Mintz] gives voice to women  whose stories  would otherwise have  "passed into  the mists of history."  genres of Rabbinic tales (with obvious moral  lessons), Midrashic tales (elaboration of Biblical text, answering questions arising from  gaps in Biblical narrative), Hasidic tales (very  short, with a fundamentalist world view and  obvious moral conclusions), and Kabbalistic  tales (dealing with the mystic aspects of Biblical interpretation).  Furthermore, Jewish tales differ greatly  depending upon the geographic and linguistic backgrounds of the storytellers and the  neighbouring societies. For instance, the tales  of the Ashkenazim (from Eastern Europe)  have a more rabbinic bent, frequently with  themes overlapping those of their Christian  neighbors, while the tales of the Sephardim  (from Spain and the Middle East) deal more  with the jinn of the underworld, borrowed  from the surrounding Arab cultures.  Bringing women from the shadows  Mintz always knew she wanted to tell  Jewish stories, but had to search hard to find  suitable story material about women. She  admits that, though she comes from a family  of storytellers, it was hard to find stories of  women who were "actors in their own lives."  Being of Eastern European heritage, Mintz  decided to use this point in time as a starting  point.  nil  i  EASTside DATAGnApkics  1460 CommerciaI Drive  teI: 255-9559 Fax: 255-5075  15% OFF  office or art supplies  with this coupon  expiry datertml 30.199*  CaII or fAx foR tree NEXT-cky cMivERy!  Waddington, a prominant Canadian writer  who lived next door: "How could the Jewish woman next door be a poet?"—meaning, she was just another neighbourhood  woman, destined to be mediocre, ordinary, to conform.  Mintz' goal as a performer, then, is to  provide a means by which people can  know what life was like in Eastern Europe  before the Holocaust—especially for Jewish women. But her stories are not only  about Jewish women in Eastern Europe  before and during World War II. At least  one of her stories is adapted from a  Chassidic, Bal Shem Tov story. Another is  about modern Israel and Palestinian  "women in black" who hold weekly vigils  in Jerusalem to protest the occupation in  the West Bank.  In the end, Mintz' stories turn out to  be about women who are relatively "ordinary," and perhaps would be considered  unworthy of mention by other storytellers,  not because they are ordinary, but because  they refuse to conform to the mediocre.  Her protagonists are not famous women.  They are not super-achievers or celebrities. They are brave women, however, and  take centre stage through the vibrancy of  Mintz' performance.  There is no name for it  In a departure from most Jewish storytelling, Mintz acknowledges and celebrates lesbian lives in Jewish life. "As a  lesbian, I feel I chose a life outside my  culture and my community," says Mintz.  She points out that, like in many other  cultures, lesbian lives remain hidden from  and unacknowledged by the mainstream.  Her recognition of the contributions of  El  A Book About Menopause  50 pages of complete and factual information on  menopause, including body changes, health  issues, sexuality in women's middle years.

Send s400  lesbians to Jewish community is also a recognition of the vast diversity of Jewish life.  Mintz' framing of her stories is quite  unbelievable, as she tempers the message  according to the era in which the tale is set.  For example, in a story adapted from a novel  in progress by Elana Dykewomon, Mintz  recounts a Jewish coming-out story, set somewhere before World War II in Eastern Europe.  A young woman wants to learn how to  live independently (Jewish women in the  audiencenod knowingly—because the Eastern European Jewish shtetls of that era were  tight-knit, thediff iculties of persuading family and neighbours to let a women remain  single would have been enormous") Gutka,  a midwife, moves in with Goldie, partly to  avoid any talk about a woman living alone.  Goldie, a seamstress, "knew how to be an  unmarried Jewish woman."  Gutka learns more than financial independence. She observes Goldie's interactions with her customers, especially a certain Vera—a modern German woman who  makes Goldie's face light up. When Goldie  invites Gutka to a party at Vera's, Gutka  finds herself gawking at women the likes of  which she's never seen before. One in particular, a woman with "eyes a deep golden  brown in the olive of her face," fascinates  her. Gutka muses that, though God used  words to make the entire world, she can't  find the words to make her own life. Dovida,  whom Gutka had originally mistaken for a  man, puts things into her own perspective.  "The Talmud tells us we must account to  God for all those pleasures we did not take  during our lives," she says, "and though I  don't think the Talmud had us in mind  particularly, the principle is the same."  The women in black  One of the more powerful stories that  Mintz performs is that of the Women in  Black, a group of Israeli and Palestinian  women who have held weekly vigils—this  story taken from an article by Gila Svirsky  refers to the women in Jerusalem—to protest the Israeli occupation in the West Bank.  Their post is near a stoplight where the light  stays red for a long time. Some of the drivers  waiting for the light, mostly men, shout out  curses and threats. In Mintz' delivery of the  story, we become acutely aware of the vulnerability of the protesting women to the  threats of men as they "act out political  abuse as sexual violence." Mintz turns our  awareness to the women's strength to do  this week after week, and she links the men's  reactions to a threat of the powerof women's  strength.  Mintz finishes her story with the line "I  will shed my black and you will shed your  fear...and together we will light a small candle," and leaves the stage. We realize it is  also the end of her performance, and we've  just been held captive, like the storyteller's  audience of poor women and servant girls,  maids and factory workers, in her spell.

Love,  Kinesis  Plea for tolerance  Kinesis:  I am writing in regards to the article by  Wendy Putman in the February 94 issue of  Kinesis, titled "Amazing Greys: How sweet  the years."  When this article first came out, Betty  Nickerson, the organizer of Amazing Greys,  asked me if I thought she should write a  rebuttal to the criticisms about this being an  event for white middle-class women with  "disposable income" et cetera. At the time, I  said, no, I don't think so. What's the point of  making a big issue of it? Getting into a  wrangle will only spoil the glow we all felt  after this wonderful time together. Besides,  Betty was exhausted from all the work and  planning. The whole thing has taken a lot out  of her.  When I got ready to send the January  issue of Herspectives out, I wanted it to  include a copy of this review so that, along  with several other reports, subsribers could  get another view of what it was like to be  there. (As well, I thought it might be good for  Kinesis.)  As I re-read the review, I could feel  myself getting annoyed and needing badly  to defend what seemed like unfair criticism  based onpersonal biases. Many of the women  who read Betty's book, Old & Smart and  responded to it, borrowed it from the library. Many women buy books beca use they  need the connection with other women, not  because they are some kind of intellectual  snobs or have more money than they know  what to do with.  Although this is a great review, I cannot  let the part go by about the participants  being middle-class women with a lot of  disposable income who "were not caring for  ailing spouses, or have enough support and  financial resouces to free themselves for a  weekend." The writer undoubtedly doesn't  know how much some women sacrificed to  get there. In some cases, it was a lot, but they  didn't want to miss it, so saved and scrimped  for months. Registration fees were waived  for a few and reduced for others, and billeting was arranged for a few who couldn't  afford to stay on site. Others doubled up in  cars to save ferry costs and others shared  rooms to save money that way.  As for Gert Beadle, she worked all her  life outside the home running a country  store and later for 16 years as a practical  nurse. As well, she worked on their farm,  raised two kids and volunteered all her life  in many areas of service. Indeed that was  what won her the Order of Cananda. She  worked at a transition house in Thunder  Bay, Ontario for nothing for six months to  getitgoing. She went outand made speeches  to local political and service groups to find  funding, then donated all the sales from her  first four books of poetry to that same transition house for over ten years. You should  ask her just how much money that is, sometime. Gert is not a rich women by any means,  but knows the value of a dollar and how to  stretch it to its utmost usefullness. She pursued her passion for poetry sitting up late at  night, like the rest of us, putting her life  down on paper instead of dying of despair in  an unhappy marriage and later to describe  the joy of her and our liberation.  I don't know where Putman was during  the poetry reading, but one of the readers  read from her journal about the pain and  loneliness of caring for her spouse who now  has Alzheimers. Who's to say there weren't  more there? All I can say is, don't judge us by  what you think you saw. We were hiding  many secrets, not the least of which was  poverty and heartaches of many kinds. But  for that weekend, we were released and  knew joy. What's so wrong about that,  whether you're rich or poor, white or not,  straight or gay? Somehow, if you're not  standing around with your hands out whining about how you can't do what you want  to do bacause of some boogy-man or other,  you're suspect, but never so much as when  you're white and daring to have a good time.  I refuse to feel shamed for something as  wonderfully uplifting as this event. I only  wish everyone could have been there. AH  white women are not middle class, nor do  they come from the same country or back-  STITCHED  .fmwc  'toNNEK  Slma Elizabeth Shefrin   1604] 734-9395  Subscribe to Volume 4 of   QLX\/JS1  A 2uaMe^Lj, j/uiteial 0/ Mcvdk A&icm IdJcwneti  Issue 1 Qpd/gw  Our Reproductive Rights  199.1  Abortion Rights, New 'Reproductive' Technologies,  Choice, Women's Health, Links Worldwide  Special Issue  JJLuj 199*       Proceedings of the Conference on Sexual Violence  Publishing & Art by Women of Colour  Issue 2  (^)..(yci.pt 199.1    Our Creative f-jcpressions in the  Histories of the Women's Movement  Sex, Sexuality & Desire  Issue 3 Oct/fJ^c 199.1 Crossing the Boundaries, identities,  Repressions, Fighting Back Together  Dynamics of Colonization: Realities Today  Issue 4 #a«/$Ila«fl 199+ Internalized Colonization, Tracing our Histories,  New Ways of Relating, Sharing Our Struggles  Subscription Rates: Volume 4 - Individual: $25  Volume 4 - Organization: $45  ClivSl427BloorSt.W.

We're all different from each other  and that's what we were there to do, to  celebrate the differences. So give us a break!  There was enough publicity about this  event to assure evryone they were welcome.  If women of colour chose not to come, it is no  fault of the organizers of the event. Let's  hope next year there's another one, (if there  isn't, I intend to have a major cry), and there  will be a better mix. Many women were  afraid of the first one. Until they find out  how much fun we had and what they missed,  then they'll want to come and if they don't,  they're fools, because a bunch of women  together in the right spirit have an energy  and joy that is boundless. So loosen up. This  sounds like just more of this political correctness crap where it doesn't matter what you  do, somebody can find something wrong  with it. We old women have had enough  criticism to last us a hundred lifetimes, so  this little bit more won't throw us. It just  hurts more coming from another woman,  especially one who was there. Tolerance,  sisters, tolerance, tolerance, tolerance.  Sincerely yours,  Mary Billy  editor, Herspectives Magazine,  Squamish, BC  Calling  Vancouver lesbians  Kinesis:  I am attempting to make contact with  women who have attended Lesbian coming  out groups at either the Gay and Lesbian  Centre or the Lesbian Centre, over the years.  This includes the facilitators and guest speakers of these groups.  My plan is to give you all a party—The  Lesbian Alumni Party. This will be a chance  for everybody to meet again with the women  they shared that important time with. You  are graduates of a very unique school and  deserve to be treated as such.  As a facilitator myself for several years,  I often wonder what happened to you all  once the group was completed. There are  those of you I see at community events, out,  proud and ha ppy, but what about the rest of  you. Did you find the women of your dreams  and move to White Rock? Are you still looking in all the wrong places? Are you raising  a family? Running a women's centre in Nelson? Inquiring minds want to know, or at  least I do.  The style of the event I wish to offer you  will depend on the response to this letter. But  an Alumni Party of some description we  shall have around the 3rd week of June in  celebration of Stonewall festival (June 25th).  So if you are one of the hundreds that  have benefitted from our Coming Our  Groups, please contact me either my mail c/  o GLC, 1170 Bute St, V6E 1Z6 or call 864-  5307.  PS. If you are still in touch with any of  the women from your particular group,  please pass this information along to them.  Let's have a night to remember and renew  those friendships, connections, et cetera.
