Kinesis  is slightly in awe of itself to be rolling along  without her, but Lynne Wanyeki and Larissa  Lai who have taken her place are having fun,  lots and lots of it...  The provincial budget is down and for  once it is not looking too bad for women,  although one could say that the government  is merely doing patchwork to cover its ass...  Where are the structural changes tha t women  need, rather than the one-off supplements  and bonuses meant to pacify us (at least for  the moment)... As Kinesis goes to press, we  have learned that certain groups doing AIDS  work have received massive cuts, in spite of  the fact that the overall AIDS budget has  increased, albeit very slightly (5 percent).  The Positive Women's Network has been  dealt a 55 percent blow which will mean the  elimination of their advocacy, peer counselling and education programs. That means  the new PWN publication announced in  What's News this month will likely be the  first and last edition. The worst cut to AIDS  budgets was dealt to Vancouver Native  Health, which was cut by 68 percent. They  will be closing down the drop-in centre for  HIV and AIDS infected people in the Downtown Eastside as a result. Also receiving cuts  are people of colour AIDS groups, who,  although they make up 30 percent of Vancouver's population are receiving only $100  thousand out a a $4.5 million AIDS budget.  Kinesis is not very impressed.  Press day at Kinesis is also election day  in South Africa, and our very own special  correspondent is there to witness this historic moment as part of the NAC observation team. Unfortunately she's so busy, she's  had no time to transcribe all the fabulous  interviews she's been recording, so we are  eagerly awaiting her return. We'll be happy  to see her too, of course.  El Salvador has also recently had a  "democratic" election. This may seem like  good news, and it is in one way. But it is also  frightening in that we are seeing the democratization of the so-called Third World happening in tandem with the growth of free  market economies and free trade. In real  terms this means more corporate "First  World" control, startingwitheconomic control, but not necessarily stopping there. In  South Africa, many state owned industries  have been sold off to coincide with the elections. For the new government to re-nationalize them in order to effect any redistribution of wealth, it would have to pay the  foreign corporations that have bought them  not only the industries' actual worth, but  also up to ten years expected profits. That's  international law for you. Real economic  change will be a long time coming. Who will  end up going through hard times to pay for  this do you suppose? Who but women, the  working class, the poor...  Where do they know this better but in  Mexico where Colosio, the presidential candidate for Mexico's current governing party  was killed in late March? Does this have  anything to with the indigenous uprising in  Chiapas on New Year's day? Whether or not  there is a planned, active relationship, at a  systemic level there can be little doubt about  a connection. Before his death Colosio was  criticized for free-market policies that were  too close to those of the current Salinas  administration. Women, the working class,  the poor and the colonized know that all  these things are related and refuse to be  silent.  Here in Canada, recommended changes  to the Employment Standards Act have been  announced, and women are hoping they  will get implemented. But why haven't they  recommended a raise in the minimum wage?  Considering how many women work for  minimum wage and how hard they work. In  an article on the inequities of the Canadian  taxation system Ellen Woodsworth wonders why the well-to-do have so many tax  loopholes that make them even better off,  while the greatest burden on the taxation  system is still falling on women and the  poor.  On our doorstep, the Vancouver Status  of Women has just been struck by a 15  percent cut to its budget by the City of  Vancouver. This will likely mean staff cuts.  More work, fewer women getting properly  paid to do it. What else is new? What do they  think women run on - fresh air, water and  love?  Look out for our cenrrespread on Black  women and male violence. Three Black  women working in the shelter movement  give a sharp analysis on the type of racism  they encounter and talk about why some  Black women stay in abusive relationships,  and how they are working to change that.  Speaking of violence, and speaking of  connections that the mainstream, corporate-  funded media just absolutely refuse to make,  there is bad news on the young woman who  pulled the alarm on the criminology professor who gave his male students a paper  assignment to design the perfect rape last  fall. Krista Scott was brutally beaten this  week in a women's washroom at the College  of New Caledonia. A man struck her repeatedly in the face and head. She was unconscious when she was admitted into hosptial.  But police and the papers are refusing to the  make the connection between her feminist  work and the beating.  After all this harsh news it feels a little  odd to end on an amusing note, but there is  a good one you might not want to miss. An  American firm has designed a new weapon  that women can supposedly use to ward off  rapists. It's called Rapel. It is basically a  small glass vial that a woman can wear  under her clothing and break by squeezing it  with her thumb and forefinger if she is attacked. The liquid inside the vial releases a  foul smell. Body heat increases the potency  of the stink ten fold. Another stupid commodity that plays into the myth that women  ask for it by what they're wearing, and also  assumes that women's attackers are strangers. We're not impressed.

The benefit is scheduled to take place at the end of June sometime. There'll be music, entertainment, food,  raffle prizes, and this year, we'll have T-  shirts and postcards marking our twenty  years of existence. Read next month's issue  of Kinesis for all the details.  We're happy "Kinesites" because Fatima  Jaffer is coming home soon. Fatima, who  edits and takes care of everyday things at  Kinesis, has been away for a whole month in  South Africa as part of the NAC delegation  observing the election, which is taking place  as Kinesis goes to press.  And while Fatima's been away, the  Kinesis volunteers have had no time to play.  This issue was brought to you through the  tremendous energy of many, many volunteers, and through the magnif icient efforts of  Lynne Wanyeki and Larissa Lai, who guest-  edited the paper. Thanks Lynne. Thanks  Larissa.  A big welcome to the new writers in this  issue: Mary McAllister, Michiko Mochizuki,  Keisa Campbell, Dega Omar, and Elvenia  Grey. Mary provided Kinesis with a look at  Rape Relief's 99 Federal Steps to ending violence against women. Michiko interviewed  US activist, Akiko Carver about lesbians in  the military. And Keisa, Dega and Elvenia  got together to talk about violence against  Black womenand their activism workagainst  male violence for this issue's centrespread  article.

In every issue of Kinesis, we seem to  make a few mistakes, so why should the  April issue be any different. (We're just testing to see if our beloved readers pore through  the paper carefully, from cover to cover.)  In our Movement Matters section (page  7), we left out the date for the BC Summer  Institute for Union Women. The institute  will take place June 18 to 22 at Simon Fraser  University in Burnaby.  We also forgot to put a contact number  and address for the international conference  on the roles and rights of women to be held  in Adelaide in October. Unfortunately  though, when we tried to write up a correction notice to go in this issue, we couldn't  find the original information that was sent to  us...so we still can't give you the contact  number and address. Sorry. If you happen  to know how to reach the conference organizers, please let us know, so we can print the  information in Kinesis and let our readers  know too. Thanks.  This issue, we couldn't even get past the  first page of the paper—the table of contents-  -without making a mistake...okay, actually,  we made three on that page. It was a very  long night before press day.  Apologies to Fatima Jaffer-we forgot to  credit her with having taken the cover photo  of Juanita Low at the IWD rally in Vancouver.  On that same page, we should have  listed Lai Two, and not Larissa Lai, as the  author of the review of Nice Rodriguez's  book, Throw it to the River.  And finally in the table of contents, we  incorrectly credited Shannon e. Ash with  writing the article on the Everywoman's  Health Centre's fight against harassment  from anti-choice protesters. In fact, it was  Erin Mullan who wrote that story.  Of course we couldn't stop at that...in  the Everywoman's story itself (page 4), we  accidently lost the end of the article. We  inadvertently cut off part of the quote by  Kim Zander of the Everywoman's Health  Centre. Our sincere apologies to Kim Zander,  Everywoman's Health Centre and Erin  Mullan for that error.  So here is the quote in its entirety: "The  public support that the clinic received after  our call to our supporters to put pressure on  the government has been useful. We are  continuing to negotiate and feel we are making headway."  Well, this all just shows that we're not  perfect, but we do try! News  BC budget:  New budget, old news  by Jackie Brown   Thanks primarily to an increase in operating funds to the Ministry of Women's Equality, there was some positive news for women  in the NDP's March budget: new and /or continued funding for women's centres, transition houses, and childcare programs.  Core funding to women's centres, base  funding to transition houses, and money for  sexual assault and other counselling under the  Stopping the Violence program, is secured for  another year at last year's levels. There is also  additional money for new transition house  services but no information is available on  how it will be utilized and distributed. The  ministry is currently working out thedetails in  consultation with transition house representatives.  There is substantially more money in the  pot for childcare (defined by the ministry as in-  home services) and daycare (defined as dropoff centres). Childcare gets a budget increase  of 43 percent, while daycare subsidies goes up  by 30 percent.  The Ministry of Women's Equality and  the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs were the  only ones to receive budget increases this year.  Some areas within Women's Equality will get  "...there must be  funding guarantees  so that one organization  doesn't get cut  in order to  fund another."  - Fawzia Ahmad  small increases, such as a two percent increase  to community programs and a six percent  increase to the "Stopping the Violence" initiative which funds certain services for sexual  assault survivors. Other areas are receiving  substantially more money, particularly  daycare, which increases by 30 percent to $98.7  million, and childcare which increases by 44  percent to $63.5 million.  Last September, transition house services,  da ycare subsidies and certain aspects of childcare such as special needs programs, were  transferred from the Ministry of Social Services to Women's Equality. As a result, transition houses are now part of the Stopping the  Violence program and the ministry is responsible for all aspects of childcare except licensing.  The ministry stresses that program increases  in the budget are true increases—not the result  of the transfers.  In an interview with Kinesis, Women's  Equality Minister Penny Priddy said she is  delighted with this year's budget allocations  and especially with the fact that 90 percent of  her ministry's funding goes directly into services for women. "This ministry is not retrenching on its commitment to the women of B.C."  According to Priddy, childcare increases  will be used to create additional spaces and  "new and innovative programs." While no  details are available on who will get what and  when, she says the ministry will be making  major childcare announcements in May.  In the meantime, it appears that some of  the daycare subsidy money will go towards  wage supplements for private sector childcare  workers, as part of the ministry's "low wage  redress" initiative. "Last year marked the first  time ever in the province that wage supple  ments were issued to the non-profit childcare  sector," says Priddy. "This is phase two: how  to extend the subsidies to other underpaid  workers, including those in licensed family-  run daycares."  Last year's supplement came in the form  of a one-time, lump sum payment. Women's  centre workers also received a supplement.  According to a ministry spokesperson,  an announcement on private sector supplements will likely be made during the upcoming  for counselling services, which  we're struggling to keep going on a 24 hour  mandate, with only three women who also  do volunteer training and other work.  There's a lot we still need."  Fawzia Ahmad of Women Against Violence Against Women (WAV AW) says while  secured funding for another year is positive, she is frustrated with the year-to-year  contract process and the lack of funding  guarantees. "The ministry should adopt a  Childcare high on women's agenda  Early Childhood Educators' Association of  BC (ECEABC) conference. Ministry representatives are expected to give a synthesis  report and put forward recommendations regarding input received from a community  consultation begunabout six weeks ago. Women's Equality and the ECEABC, which represents both non-profit and private sector  childcare workers, facilitated the consultation  process.  According to the spokesperson, its main  goal was to determine how to ensure accountability among private agencies receiving government wage supplements. The spokesperson says the ministry is also interested in  moving from a lump sum approach to an  ongoing process designed to increase wages  of all childcare workers.  While the budget had good news for  women, it also had its disappointments. For  example, there is no money again this year for  those women's centres waiting for core funding. However, Priddy says she will continue  to push treasury for more. "It has been my  commitment to work for additional funding  for women's centres and I will continue to do  that," Priddy said, adding that the ministry  will also do what it can to provide other forms  of financial assistance, such as program and  service grants. (  In the meantime, many women's centres,  and particularly those who do not receive core  funding, will continue to struggle to provide  services. Says Dega Omar of the Surrey Women's Centre, for example: "We haven't received core funding although we've been told  over and over that it's coming. And there is no  two-year minimum contract process to provide stability and there must be funding  guarantees so that one organization doesn't  get cut in order to fund another. When that  happens, women are left stranded," says  Ahmad.  For Jean Swanson of End Legislated  Poverty (ELP) the government's failure to  increase the minimum wage is a major  disappointment. "This is the simplest way  to reduce poverty at no expense to the  taxpayer," says Swanson. "But the worst  thing of all is that welfare increases are less  than the inflation rate. That means that the  poorest of the poor will get poorer."  Swanson is also sceptical about Ministry of Skills,Training and Labour plans to  dump $90 million this year and $120 million next year into new skills and training  initiatives. (The ministry says these will  include resources to support women's job  training. At press time, Kinesis had not been  able to obtain details on specific measures  for women).  "I'm really scared that this is playing  into the federal social policy review, which  emphasizes training as an alternative to job  creation," says Swanson. "You can have  skilled people but if there are no jobs, then  what? And the government talks about creating 60,000 jobs but we need 1.6 million.  We don't believe in creating more working  poverty so those jobs also have to be at a  decent wage."  Shawna Butterwick of the Women's  Employment and Training Centre says  women will have to wait and see how and  if they will benefit from the new training  money. "There aren't any details available right now but there is a flurry of  activity involving community project  teams designed to provide grassroots input on women and work. The province is  also planning to set up a new provincial  training board that will include women's  representatives. But we don't know yet  how this activity is going to translate into  money for new programs for women."  Kay Sinclair of Women for Better  Wages (WBW) says while training,  "You can have  skilled people, but if  there are no jobs,  then what?"  - Jean Swanson  childcare and other initiatives for women  seem positive, as a group committed to  wage equity, WBFW is unhappy that no  money was allocated for pay equity. "This  is [supposed to be] part of government's  commitment to women to put money in  the hands of working women to end wage  discrimination," says Sinclair. WBW is  also concerned that the minimum wage  didn't change.  As far as childcare increases are concerned, the new initiatives are generally  welcome. But, as ELP's Jean Swanson  says, it is too early to tell if poor women  will now have better access to the service.  Likewise, WAVAW's Fawzia Ahmad says  childcare must be made more accessible  to poor women, women of colour and  First Nations women. "So it's important  for women's groups to have a say in how  this money will be used to make sure  there is fair distribution and access," she  says.  Penny Priddy says her ministry is  aware of these and other access concerns  and is committed to improving childcare  access for all women.  Susan Harney, chair of the BC Daycare  Action Coalition (BCDAC), comprised of  both non-profit and private sector  childcare organizations, is also pleased  with increased childcare funding. "Historically, you're looking at a field that has  been underpaid in all sorts of ways."  Commenting on the likelihood of  wage supplements for private sector  workers, Harney says BCDAC's position  is that public dollars should go only to  non-profit centres. However, the coalition supports wage redress for workers  across the board. "All workers are underpaid and quality is offered in non-profit  and private sectors," she says. Harney  adds, however, that any agency receiving  government funds must be accountable.  "The interest was and is to come up with  an accountability system to stabilize the  field... From the BCDAC's point of view,  we'd like to see privately run centres  'grandparented' in so that they follow the  same accountability measures as the non-  profit sector."

Ash  The Legal Services Society of British  Columbia is planning some changes to BC's  legal aid system. Lawyers doing legal aid  oppose the changes. Some advocates for  women using the system are also concerned,  while others think it may help.  The proposed reforms are an attempt to  deal with issues raised in the 1992 Agg Report on legal aid. The report noted LSS had  a financial deficit, management and organizational problems, service delivery problems, a crisis in family legal aid, and inconsistent availability of service—particularly  in theareasof family and poverty law. Timothy Agg was hired by the provincial government to do a review of legal services in BC  following a consultation process with vari-  ousgroups.lt was released in the fall of 1992.  Besides addressing the Agg Report, the  reforms are meant to address a growing  caseload and the problem of limited funding.  Among the proposals is a plan to create  160 new lawyer, paralegal and support staff  positions by April 1995, and set up 16 new  legal aid offices and expand existing offices.  Their goal is to have staff deliver service to 50  per cent of the cases now handled by the  "tariff service." This is the system by which  lawyers who are in private practice are paid  a fee for legal aid cases by LSS.  The stated goal of LSS is to accommodate an expected increase in the number of  legal aid cases—five percent per year for the  next six years. Funding will not be increased.  LSS states that this " mixed model" option, as  it calls it, will save money over time, and is  the best option, given the other options of  reducing fees paid to lawyers or cutting the  number of people eligible to receive aid.  The Association of Legal Aid Lawyers  (ALL) strongly opposes this plan. In a notice  to its members, ALL warns that the changes  will result in a deterioration of service for  clients and will not relieve funding problems. Staff lawyers will be expected to carry  an unreasonable number of cases. Choice of  counsel will be affected. For example, those  charged as Young Offenders will lose choice  of counsel.  MeganEllis practises family law in Vancouver. She describes family law legal aid as  "pathetic..grossly underfunded, poorly administered," and thinks the LSS plan will  make it worse. Currently, says Ellis, too few  lawyers are willing to do family law cases, as  the fees are low. It is primarily junior lawyers who take these on. Women have difficulty finding a lawyer, and sometimes have  difficulty with the lawyer.  Nancy Drewitt of Munroe House, a  Vancouver transition house for battered  women and children, told Kinesis that women  have reported inadequate representation  from lawyers. Sometimes lawyers do not  return calls. Sometimes they pressurewomen  to make agreements they don't want. Sometimes, due to newness in the field, they give  bad advice.  Women with disabilities and immigrant  women are more likely to use legal aid, says  Ellis, and these cases tend to be more complicated, requiring more time and costs.  One of Ellis' concerns about the plan is  that LSS is not addressing the budgetary  issue. Demand is going up, and will likely  increase further as clinics are opened and  women previously without access begin to  use them. Funding for the family law system  needs to be increased, she says. Currently,  criminal law, which primarily serves men,  receives the bulk of funding, and pays lawyers more. "Legal aid was constructed with  criminal law in mind," says Ellis. She adds  that women, who primarily use family law  services, are not as well served by it.  Another concern Ellis has is that choice  of counsel will not be guaranteed. The LSS  proposal states that there will be limits on  choice "innecessary circumstances," including "ensuring stable and sufficient caseloads  for staff lawyers." Ellis states that having a  staff lawyer is no guarantee of sensitive  services. "Women need to have choice," she  says.  Ellis says that the situation for women is  worse outside the Lower Mainland. Sue Egers  of the Port Alberni Women's Resources Centre concurs, but argues that women in rural  areas will have more choice if the LSS plan  goes ahead. Egers, who is also on the board  of the Legal Services Society (Family Law  Service), says the new community law offices will increase access for rural women.  Currently, women often can't find a lawyer  who does legal aid cases. If they do find one,  he or she may be in another town and often  women can't afford the long distance calls.  Egers describes the situation in Port  Alberni, which has four law offices, three of  which have three lawyers each. Only three  lawyers out of the ten in town do "any  substantial" family legal aid. What has occurred in some cases is that a man involved  in legal action with a woman using legal aid  will go to a law office for a ha If-hour consultation with a lawyer there. The woman then  can't access a lawyer in that law office. The  woman has to go to another community to  find legal help.  Egers does allow that there will be rural  areas where choice won't be increased by the  plan, as there won't be enough offices to  cover all districts.  "Legal aid must not attempt to save  money at the expense of endangering women  and children," states Nancy Drewitt in a  submission to LSS. She notes that many of  the women using their transition house services also use legal aid for custody and access  cases, since "men who batter frequently attempt to maintain contactand control through  custody and access agreements once the  women leave." The women who operate  Munroe House strongly oppose mediation  in these cases, stating that women do not do  as well as men in mediation. They say that it  should never be used where there is abuse.  They are concerned that the legal clinic plan  may include mediation.  Drewitt says that they are also concerned about women's choice. "In Vancouver women wanted individual lawyers, not  legal clinics. If legal clinics are developed,  then women must have the choice to use the  clinic or choose their own lawyer."  Lawyers who do good work for women  are not properly reimbursed, Drewitt says.  They are overused as they are constantly in  demand by women. She supports legal advocates, who should be funded and trained.  It will save money by preparing women to  make better use of time with lawyers.  There are concerns about impacts on  legal aid for immigration law as well.  Catherine Fas, an immigration lawyer in  Vancouver, is concerned that choice of lawyer will be limited, stating that immigrants  often wish to choose a lawyer from their  own communities. She is also apprehensive  about the idea of using paralegals, rather  than lawyers, for refugee hearings. Fas notes  that the Refugee Board in Vancouver is the  toughest in the country. She says, "You need  experienced people to deal with them." Fas  says refugee claimants have often experienced persecution by the state and may be  reluctant to trust legal counsel hired by a  government agency.  Fas believes the current system is working well and that fees are reasonable, unlike  the family law system.  Emma Andrews of MOSAIC, a Vancouver community agency that assists immigrants, also thinks the system generally  works well, but is not concerned about the  proposed changes. She says many new lawyers are taking on legal aid cases and generally doing a good job. However, she says  some lawyers are irresponsible and spend  little time with clients. LSS doesn't appear to  be supervising them, she says. There should  be more accountability. Andrews doesn't  see any problems with the plans for clinics  with staff and the use of paralegals.  Discussions between the Association of  Legal Aid Lawyers and the Legal Services  Society are at a standstill at present. ALL has  not ruled out the possibility of withdrawing  services. There was such a "strike" in 1991  over fees, which was resolved by a fee increase. The Agg report agreed the fees were  inadequate, but argued the increase was too  great, given the other areas of legal aid needing funding.  LSS had proposed a similar plan to its  present one in 1993. ALL opposed it, and a  compromise was reached whereby a pilot  program in staff/clinic delivery would be  set up and evaluated. ALL says LSS has  breached this agreement by going ahead  with this plan. LSS admits to having forgone  the official evaluation. They say it isn't necessary because they have enough informa-  MUNRO • PARFITT  LAWY ERS  quality legal services in a  woman friendly atmosphere  labour/em ploym en t,  human rights,  criminal law and  public interest advocacy.  401-825 granville street,  Vancouver, b.c. v6z 1 k9  689-7778(ph)     689-5572 (fax)  tion to calculate the resources needed to put  the plan into action.  Although LSS plans to implement its  proposals, having passed them at a board  meeting in February, it has stated that extra  funding will be needed from the provincial  government for this. While Attorney-General Colin Gableman supports the plan, no  promises are being made about funding beyond the current levels.

The good news comes in recommendations to remove the mostdiscriminatory parts  of current laws that set minimum standards  for such basic working conditions as wages,  hours of work, paid holidays and vacations.  If the changes are adopted, the most  oppressed and poorest workers in BC—  women working as domestics or farm workers, women working part time or on piece  work at home—would be entitled to the same  basic rights the law gives other BC workers.  But even if the government decides to act  on all the proposed changes, BC law still  won't even come close to making the changes  we need to help working women and other  poor people live in dignity instead of poverty.  "It's inexcusable they didn't recommend  raising the minimum wage now—a lot—for  everybody," says Jean Swanson of End Legislated Poverty (ELP), a coalition of groups  fighting poverty.  The recommmendations, unveiled in  mid-March, are contained in a 180-page report by Mark Thompson, a professor of commerce at the University of BC. The provincial  government a ppointed Thompson a year ago  to review employment standards in BC with  the help of an advisory committee.  During public hearings last fall in thirteen BC cities, ELP and other organizations  urged the government to raise the minimum  wage to $9.05 an hour as soon as possible,  because current rates are so low peopleacross  the country are working full-time and still  living in deep poverty.  Thompson's report says groups of workers now excluded from the right to be paid  the minimum wage, like domestic workers  and farm workers, ought to be covered by the  same minimum standards as other workers.  The report also recommends removing the  lower minimum wage for employees under  the age of 18.  But the report fails to recommend any  increase to BC's minimum wage rate of $6 an  hour, and says exemptions to the minimum  rate should be removed only so long as the  minimum wage stays at 40 to 50 per cent of  the average industrial wage.  In other words, says ELP's Swanson,  "the minimum wage should cover everybody as long as it's inadequate. The implication is as soon as it's adequate there should be  all kinds of exemptions. But that's ridicu-  KARATE for WOMEN  i'ftWiB#HWJ33  Mon., Tues., Thurs. 7 pm  Fitness, self confidence,  self defense  ASK ABOUT BEGINNER GROUPS  113133 734-9816  INA DENNEKAMP  Piano Service  lous," she adds. "How can they dare put that  in there?"  Thompson recommends that part-time  workers who workat least 15hours per week  ought to be eligible for benefits paid to full-  time workers, on a pro-rated basis.  "A wide range of paid benefits should  be available to all workers regardless of the  number of hours they work," says Women  for Better Wages, in a four-page response to  Thompson's report.  to domestic workers, allowing workersto  claim unpaid wages going back 24 months  instead of only six, and introducing a system of escalating penalties for employers  who break the law repeatedly.  "We are pleased that the review committee has listened and they have incorporated our recommendations in their recommendations," says Crisanta Sampang, program co-ordinator of the West Coast Domestic Workers Association (DWA).  "The fight is only halfway won, so to  speak," she adds. "Because they're only  recommendations. There is nothing concrete yet."  The DWA and other groups are urging  the government to act on the recommenda-  tionsassoona's possible. AsSampang says:  "What's the point of spending lots of money  for this review, if they're not going to act?"  Even if the government adopts the  recommendations, many activists say enforcing the law will still be the biggest  problem.  And despite the shortcomings of recommended changes, "as women workers in  the province we need to demand government change the regulations immediately,  particularly for the most vulnerable workers, like domestic workers and farm workers," she adds.  "We cannot emphasize enough to government how important it is they implement  these changes immediately," says Miche Hill,  program co-ordinator for Vancouver Status  of Women. Many recommendations could  take effect through simple changes in regulations, rather than changing the law itself,  she adds.  Labour minister Dan Miller has said  groups and individuals can comment on the  Thompson report until May 16, and legislative changes won't be drafted until after that.  "They just need to act," says Hill. "We  don't know why he's waiting. We don't see  any reason."  The need for action is especially pressing because of the economic environment  i "We cannot emphasize enough to government  | how important it is to implement these changes  j immediately" - Miche Hill  "If workers are entitled to benefits, that  entitlement should not be tied to the number  of hours they work. Dr. Thompson's recommendation of a cutoff at 15 hours per week is  simply an invitiation to employers to hire  workers for no more than 14 hours," the  group adds.  Women for Better Wages is a coalition of  community women's groups, union women's committees, and interested individual  women. The response, which gives a good  summary of the concerns various women's  groups are expressing about the proposed  changes, went to BC Skills, Training and  Labour minister Dan Miller in mid-April.  The Thompson reportrecommendsother  changes that could benefit low-wage workers, like extending overtime pay provisions  J>  R  T   N  X  Making a Postive Impression  for Otir Community Since 1984  (604) 980-4235  • Women   Owned   &   Operated*   II  1716 Ourlei Street, Vancouver, BC VSL 2T5 (604)253-3142  smoke free cappuccino bar • vegetarian snacks  cards • cd's/cassettes • clothing 'jewelry  Open Tuesday - Sunday  Womyn's Open Stage Fri May 27  j "They're not .that strong on recom-  L mendations for enforcement," points out  Lorina Serafico, a spokesperson for the  VancouverCommittee for Domestic Workers and Caregivers'Rights (CDWCR). "This  is the area where we, as advocates for  domestic workers, are having problems."  The CDWCR and other groups urged  the government to establish a central registry of domestic workers, to help protect  these workers' rights. But Thompson's report ignores the idea.  "We want the central registry as a  mechanism, so we know the workers and  know where they are. This is very important to us," Serafico says. At present, only  federal immigration authorities have a list  of employers with live-in domestic workers.  Another concern women's groups  share is that Thompson's report fails to  recommend any increases in funding or  staff to help enforce the law.  "We know now that the Employment  Standards Branch [the provincial body that  administers the ESA] is underfunded and  understaffed," says Janet Shaw, a union  organizer with the Health Sciences  AssociationfHSA).  Among the HSA's 8,000 members (85  per cent of them women) are women working in transition houses, drug and alcohol  treatment facilities, and other residences  where women work overnight. "I certainly  hear the horror stories of people being  unable to enforce the Employment Standards Act now," Shaw says.  DR.

We need  all the protection we can get our hands on  right now," Hill says. "Those things have to  be named."  Amanda Ocran, a co-ordinator of the  Industrial Homework Working Group, says  homeworkers need the same minimum  wages and benefits as other workers, and  more active enforcement of the law to protect their rights. "These things we are asking  for do not need legislation," she says.  Ocran estimates there are about 3,000  homeworkers in the greater Vancouver area.  "It's women. And it's also—97 per cent in  the lower mainland—women of colour. And  there's a significant number of recent immigrants," she adds.  In BC, just over 90 per cent of industrial  homeworkers work in the garment industry, Ocran says. "And there's some light  assembly, like putting together children's  toys."  Ministry officials responsible for enforcing the law need to recognize the special  problems homeworkers face. "If you are a  homeworker you are isolated. You don't  know what other people are being paid for  the work you do," Ocran says.  When homeworkers complain to the  Employment Standards Branch about not  being paid for their work, the employment  standards officer "always turns it into a my-  word-against-yours" situation, she adds.  Officials of the Employment Standards  Branch have said publicly the most common  defence used by employers accused of violating the law is to deny that the person  making the complaint waseveran employee  of theirs.  That's an old story for homeworkers,  Ocran says. "There are no witnesses. They  just pretend they've never seen you before,"  she says. "Homeworkers don't feel protected  when they go in and try to get their basic  rights."  Sue Volmnka is a Vancouver-based writer. News  The Long Haul:  ELP turns a new page  by Siobahn M.C. Herron  and Lai Two   End Legislated Poverty (ELP) sent its  new tabloid newspaper, The Long Haul, to  print in March. The Long Haul is an amalgamation of three separate publications that  ELP ran until March of this year. These were  ELP Newsletter, which provided legal information for low income people; FLAWline,  which provided information for advocates;  and Action Line, which gave a voice to low  income people.  End Legislated Poverty is an anti-poverty coalition which was formed in 1985 to  combat poverty and increasing unemployment in British Columbia. From its inception, ELP has been a politically active coalition which views poverty as a legislation  issue rather than the problem of an unfortunate minority, which has been the traditional charitable standpoint. Rather than  employing individual advocacy and charity, ELP employs a political approach, soliciting the help of welfare recipients as well as  unionized and non-unionized workers. Its  goalsare toencouragecooperation and unity  between working and non-working people,  to assist organizations representing low income and unemployed people through information sharing, the development of joint  campaigns and actions, to encourage education on the need to eliminate poverty and  crea te decent jobs, and to assist in organizing  low-income and unemployed people.  ELP's newsletters have always played  an integral role in increasing public awareness of poverty issues, providing information to its constituency, and giving a voice to  low income people.  The Long Haul is 12 pages long and  devotes the same amount of space to the  concerns of the three newsletters as when  the newsletters were separate entities. There  are two pages of legal information for low  income people. This section uses plain language and provides bigger print for the  benefit of those who need it. In the first issue,  this section contains an article on  tenants'rights, an article on the recent letter  campaign protesting the provincial government's new requirement that welfare recipients line up to collect their cheques, and a  report on the recent minimum wage increase.  There are also two pages of information  for front line advocacy workers. Topics in  the first issue include guidelines suggested  by the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association (DERA) to the Ministry of Social  Services (MSS) regarding "recovery houses"  for alchohol and drug users, and attacks on  unemployment insurance in the recent federal budget. There is also an article that gives  encouraging statistics on welfare recipients  who have appealed unfair rulings by the  MSS and won.  The remaining eight pages are devoted  to editorials, letters to the editor, contributions from around the province, poverty  CCEC Credit Union  Loans available for.  • a well-deserved  vacation j^  • spring <-/   >^  home renovations  • a car  ' or recreational vehicle  • reasonable rates  • flexible terms  • automatic deductions  • free life insurance on loans  • no pre-payment penalty  Try us first  Introducing Amplesize Park's  own line of clothing  New hours:  Mon, Tues, Thurs 11-6  Fri 11-7  Sat 10:30-4:30  Closed Wed & Sun  Quality consignment  clothing  Size 14... plus  Amplesize Park has moved to:  1969 Commercial Dr.  Vancouver, B.C.

In the March issue,  there were several articles on the new welfare cheque line-ups, an article criticizing the  government for scrutinizing "welfare fraud,"  instead of looking at the vast amounts of  revenue it loses in tax frauds perpetrated by  moreaffluentCanadians,andanarticleabout  an anti-poverty single mothers' group in  Esquimalt. There is also an article discussing  some of the concerns for low income people  about changes the Liberal government will  be making to the social safety net in 1995.  The amalgamation allows ELP to increase circulation and to serve its constituency better. It costs the same amount to  distribute 5,000 copies of The Long Haul as it  did to distribute 2000 copies of the ELP  Newsletter and 850 copies each of FLAWline  and Action Line. The paper is funded through  project grants and produced with an enor  mous amount of volunteer work. The Hospital Employees Union and the BC Government Employees Union make a contribution  to ELP by distributing the paper atxio cost.  The Long Haul is distributed to anti-  poverty groups throughout the province,  Vancouver Public Libraries, to food bank  line-ups, and to the ELP office on Vancouver  Island. Happily, the first issue of the new  paper released in March "sold out" rapidly.  However, circulation will remain at 5000 for  the time being in order to keep costs at their  present level.  The Long Haul welcomes your financial  and human support. If you can volunteer  either, please contact Jean Swanson at 879-  1209.   Sioblmn M. C. Herron and Lai Two are  Vancouver-based writers.

What's News  by Lissa Geller  Child Custody  and Access  Following up an invitation from the federal Department of Justice in 1993, the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of  Women (CACSW) has released the brief  which it presented to the Department which  includes recommendations on child custody  and access. The report is a result of consultations held in the fall of 1993 with 17 women  from across Canada and two legal experts  from the United States. The recommendations in the report seek to make court decisions less arbitrary, offer more protection  from abusive mates for women and children  and reduce lengthy court delays.  Specific concern was centred around the  vague wording of the 1985 amendment to the  Divorce Act which says custody decisions  should be based on the "best interests of the  child." A communique from CACSW notes  that the wording "allows subjective judgment of the fitness of the parents. There is too  much leeway for judges to define 'the good  mother' as one meeting a sexually and racially discriminatory stereotype."  The CACSW brief also expressed concerns about judges who believe women raise  false allegations of abuse against fathers in  order to win custody. In fact, the brief points  out, women who raise allegations that fathers are sexually or physically abusing their  children have been accused of "parental alienation" by the courts.  Much of the brief deals with what  CACSW identifies as a recent trend in Canada  towards involuntary joint custody awards.

To address these issues and others identified by the brief, CACSW is suggesting  amendments to the Divorce Act which would  award custody to the children's primary  caregiver in contested cases. This would be  contestable only in the rarest and most urgent circumstances and would not be rebutted if the mother is lesbian, sexually active,  in the paid labour force, relying on others  for child care, less financially secure than  the other parent, physically challenged or  receiving psychiatric care.  As Supreme Court of Canada judge  Mada me Ju stice L'Heureux-Dube has noted,  "The primary caregiver  presumption... recognizes theobligationand  supports the authority of the parent engaged in day to day tasks of children rearing."  As well, the brief calls for more explicit  legal direction that children not be placed in  the custody of, or subject to unsupervised  visits with, a violent parent. It also calls for  the removal of provisions claiming that it is  in the best interests of children to have  maximum contact with both parents.  The brief was submitted to the Federal/Provincial/Territories Family Law  Committee in February 1994. The committee is reviewing child custody and access  law and policy, and will be making recommendations to the federal Minister of Justice and provincial Attorneys General.  Counting Motherwork  The British Women's Rights Committee has successfully lobbied the European  Parliament to recognize the importance of  women's unpaid work. The Parliament has  passed a report calling for member governments to count women's unwaged work  when determining its Gross National Product. As well, the report calls for pension  rights and other benefits for women working in the home, monetary allowances for  people raising children and protection of  the rights of mothers returning to waged  work.  The British group Wages for Housework  says these measures will also help women  who perform similar work outside of the  home. Also, counting women's unwaged  work is an anti-racist measure which will  begin to count what Black and immigrant  women have contributed through generations of unwaged and low-waged work.  Port Alberni  Health Centre  Renovations to upgrade the current  hospital in Port Alberni would amount to $2  million more than to build a brand new  facility. That's the rationale being used to  build a new hospital and acute care facility  in Port Alberni. The new building, which  will take two years to complete, will be  completely wheelchair accessible and will  include more emergency and ambulatory  care and x-ray and laboratory space. As  well, the new location of the hospital is large  enough to allow for other health care services to be built on the same site.  barbara findlay  s delighted to announce  :hac she is now practising 1;  with the law firm of  Smith and Hughes  321-1525 Robson St.  Vancouver  phone 683-4176  Smith and Hughes offer a full range of  le%al ser.'ices to the lesbian, gay and  bisexual communities of Vancouver.

Positive  Women's Network  The Positive Women's Network in Vancouver has begun publishing a quarterly  magazine designed to address the issues and  concerns of HIV-positive women. Its primary goal, according to editor Janet Madsen  is "to get information to people who can use  it: HIV-positive women, their families and  friends, health care providers, support providers, and people who want to educate  themselves."  The first volume, titled Positive Women's Network, was published in March 1994  and includes articles on various issues including self esteem, prejudice and discrimination in HIV/AIDS and sexual healthcare.  There are also regular columns on food and  nutrition, services and support, self-care and  treatment and a list of books available on  AIDS and HIV issues.  Those wishing to subscribe or contribute to the magazine are encouraged to contact Janet Madden at the Positive Women's  Network in Vancouver at (604) 893-2200.  Beijing Secretariat  in Canada  The Beijing Coordinating Committee  (BCC) has been formed and will be housed  at the Canadian Research Institute for the  Advancement of Women (CRIAW) offices  in Ottawa.  Among its other responsibilities, the  BCC will coordinate the input of women in  Canada into Beijing through a consultation  process, develop policy to identify women's  priorities and bring those priorities to the  table during the negotiations with governments leading up to the Beijing Conference.  As well, the BCC will attempt to ensure that  governments do express the inclusive perspectives of Canadian women at the Conference.  The BCC is currently made up of six  members chosen from national women's organizations (including CRIAW, the YWCA,  the National Council of Women and the  National Metis Women of Canada) and one  member from each of six regions in Canada.  The Committee intends to appoint another 3  to 5 members to ensure diversity in the make  up of the BCC.  The Committee will be channeling most  of its input through the UN Commission on  the Status of Women in Canada. This group  is responsible for preparing Canada's National Report as well as Canada's input into  the Platform for Action. Members of the BCC  are participating in the meeting of the Status  of Women and are providing NGO input  into the process.  Breast Cancer  Following revelations that a Montreal  oncologist, Roger Poisson, falsified as many  as 115 records over the last decade in a study  of women with breast cancer, the US government has begun examining the records of  two more Montreal hospitals. St. Mary's  Hospital and the Jewish General Hospital,  who both participated in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  (NASBP), have been asked to surrender the  data on their patients who participated in  the NASBP study. Although the hospitals  are not suspected of any wrongdoing, the  US National Cancer Institute and the Office  of Research Integrity decided to do a more  in-depth study of data to ensure the integrity  of the results and address widespread fears  among women about the efficacy of the  NASBP.  Meanwhile, provincial and federal governments have yet to conduct their own  review of Dr. Poisson, despite urgings from  women's groups and the Canadian Cancer  Society. Dr. Poisson continues to insist he  did nothing wrong by falsifying the results  of his study. Although he is barred from  participating in US biomedical studies until  the next century, he has not as yet faced any  sanctions in Canada.  Death Inquest  A public inquiry will begin in Hamilton  on May 9th into the death of a 70-year-old  elder from the Six Nations Grand River Territory near Hamilton. The woman, Garnette  Silversmith, was admitted to Henderson  Hospital following a broken arm. She was  supposed to be discharged in two days but  died in the early hours of February 22,1992.  Despite a wrist band indicating a Tylenol  allergy, Silversmith was given the medication on at least three occasions. She was also  subjected to physical, verbal and emotional  abuse, which her family believes was heavily motivated by racism (see story in Kinesis,  Dec/fan 94).  The inquest is expected to take two to  three weeks to complete and Silversmith's  family is hoping that it will deal with broad  questions including the safety of Aboriginal  people in hospitals, the existence of translation services, anti-racism training, and employment equity. The inquest will also examine why Silversmith was given Tylenol  and why the so-called fail-safes around allergies were not followed. The family is  circulating a petition demanding that there  be Aboriginal representation at the inquest.  The hospital is opposing the inclusion of  First Nations representation.  Garnette Silversmith's family have also  pursued complaints through the Ontario  College of Physicians and Surgeons and the  College of Nurses. Both of these are extremely lengthy processes. The College of  Nurses did issue written and oral reprimands against three nurses involved in Silversmith's death, but failed to take any  harsher measures against their members. As  a result, Silversmith's family is pursuing an  appeal of the decision of the College in order  to fight for further consequences for the  nurses involved.  The cost of these appeals and the printing of leaflets etc. has been very high. There  will be a benefit for the family at Sistah's  Cafe in Toronto on May 7th. Sistah's is a  woman-only space.

New date for  ALN conference  A new date has been tentatively set for  the next AsianLesbian Network (ALN) Conference—August 31 to September 3, 1995.  This conference will be held in Taipei, Taiwan.  The postponement of the conference  from September 1994, was felt to be in the  best interest of the ALN for several reasons.  An enormous amount of time was spent  drawing up a proposal for a structure for the  ALN. Members perceive it necessary to  clarify the purposes, goals, decision-making  mechanisms, and membership of the ALN  before the conference takes place. More time  is needed to plan this international event.  Taiwanese lesbians say they are still in the  process of organizing and politicizing themselves locally.  A delay will allow the ALN-Taiwan to  hold the conference closer to the Fourth UN  Conference on Women which will be held in  Beijing, from September 4-15,1995. But most  importantly, the clarification of the ALN  structure will enable them to host a much  better conference.  The ALN-Nippon, the present ALN Secretariat, will be publishing a draft proposal  of the Constitution in the next edition of the  ALN newsletter. Asian lesbians are encouraged to submit opinions, additions, and suggestions for changes concerning the Constitution proposal, as well as any suggestions  they may have as to the ratification process.

Rural lesbians group  Lesbian Natural Resources (LNR) is  dedicated to the development of rural lesbian community. They fund grants for land  purchase and development, community development programs and individual self  sufficiency projects. Their intention is to support the growth of lesbian communities actively creating lesbian culture, preserving  land-based life skills and rural ecosystems,  and discovering'non-oppressive ways to live  and work together.  LNR wishes to become known to as  many lesbian communities as possible, but  particularly to communities of colour. "As a  lesbian of colour, I know many lesbians of  colour have rural backgrounds and perhaps  have had to abandon their desire to live on  the land," says Etas, a board member. LNR  would like to make it possible for lesbians of  colour to consider establishing a rural lesbian community or joining an existing community.  In addition to monetary grants, LNR's  advocacy committee assists, upon request,  dykes with issues such as land purchase,  establishing a land trust, and obtaining tax  exempt status. LNR can also offer assistance  to lesbians in the development of rural land  skills.  For more information and/or a grant  application, please write LNR,P.O. Box 8742,  Minneapolis, MN, 55408-0742.  Black  German lesbians  ADEFRA is an organization of Black  German lesbians and Black lesbians living in  Germany, who are working to establish an  international network of Black lesbians. They  write, "A political Black movement began to  form itself eight years ago in Germany. However, no research whatsoever exists concerning the situation of Black lesbians. This is  why we plan exchanges for Black lesbians  from Germany with Black lesbian groups  from other countries, that deal with the social, political and creative aspects of Black  lesbian life."  The time and place of the first exchange  will be the 25th Anniversary of Stonewall  taking place in New York at the end of June  1994. "Black lesbian groups from all over the  world will be present, giving us the unique  opportunity to communicate directly with  them," says ADERFA.

Mutual support group  A group of abused women and community advocates meets weekly through the  Edmonton Community and Family Services  to provide mutual support, work towards  self-determined goals, and make social  changes to improve the situation for abused  women. They meet at a non-profit day care  facility, where their children are cared for by  child care staff. Participants include women  who are in or have left abusive relationships,  students, helping professionals, and community advocates.  At the "dro;~ in', women can choose to  focus on their need for support or on social  advocacy. Paid social workers and peer volunteers facilitate the group.  The goal of the group advocacy is to put  issues into action—to identify problems and  work towards solutions. Mutual advocacy  inherently changes the "service provider and  client" relationship to a mutually beneficial  partnership for social change.  For further information, contact K.

Post-treatment  centre for women  The Women's Post Treatment Centre in  Winnipeg, was formed in 1985 to help women  survivors of childhood sexual abuse who  have addiction problems. Although the Centre offers individual and group therapy, many  of the women in the program also consider  the group therapy to be a support group.  The group, which is supportive, educational  and therapeutic, helps women break out of  their isolation, experience trust and safety,  and see the creative ways they and other  members have survived abuse.

Ensuring safety is the initial emphasis  of the group. Each week begins in a consistent way, with an overview of the agenda, a  check-in, and a section called "leftovers,"  which allows women to pick up on issues  thathad been unresolved theprevious week.

Documentary  on battered women  Shakti Productions, an all-women's research and production team based in Washington DC, is currently producing a 58-  minute video documentary about battered  women called Voices Heard Sisters Unseen.  Shakti is made up of writers for print, radio  and television media; videographers, documentary producers and editors; sound engineers and audio technicians. These women  come from various racial,cultural and linguistic backgrounds and diverse sexual identities. Seventy-five percent of the team are  survivors of child and adult violence in the  family. Outside of Shakti, most of them work  to end violence against women and children  as activists, service-providers, organizers and  educators.  Voices Heard Sisters Unseen gives the  perspectives of battered women who are  deaf, disabled, lesbians, undocumented residents (of the US), prostitutes and HIV-positive. It shows interviews with women who  have been excluded from statistics and considered "less deserving" than other battered  women. It raises many questions, including:  How does a battered undocumented woman  survive when immigration policies keep her  from getting a job or foodstamps? What  does a deaf battered woman do when the  police show up but don't understand sign  language? What happens to a battered  woman with AIDS when a hospital will not  treat her? How does a battered lesbian get a  protection order when the court does not  recognize her relationship as legitimate?  Shakti is currently completing production in attempt to have the video ready for  presentation at the Fourth UN Conference  on Women being held in Beijing in 1995.

The conference was hosted by the Canadian Studies Program of the SNDT Women's University of Bombay. The purpose of the conference was to bring  Indian and Canadian activists together to discuss  violence against women in Canada and India and  to share strategies for raising awareness of violence against women for providing assistance and  support for ivomen. Pramila Agarwal, Community Liaison Officer for the Women's Information  and Action Centre ofToronlo attended the conference at the invitation of the Indian delegation.  Anjula Gogia spoke with her in Toronto.  THE CONFERENCE  Anjula Gogia: What were the main issues  raised at the conference?  Pramila Agarwal: Domestic violence was  one of the major issues...and how it gets taken  up by state agencies or state courts, judges  and general society. As to why it happens  and who's responsible for it. Then a whole  other focus on violence against women and  children. We spent a morning on violence at  work.  Gogia: Violence against women at work?  Agarwal: Yes, including sexual harassment, rejection, stress, helplessness. [We also  talked about] prostitutes and violence against  prostitutes. The Canadian side was basically  presenting lists of studies on what they had  done. Like one they had done in London,  Agarwal: We take it for granted so you've  always got your horns locked with the state.  Gogia: That takes away from the work.  Aganual: It takes away from the work  but there isn't any other way of doing it  either because there hasn't been any history  of doing that, for at least the last 50 years or  so.  Gogia: Were there any commonalities?  Agarwal: Yes, rape happens and incest  happens and these are pervasive phenomena. But we cannot really compare the two  [situations in both countries]. We can only  say that these are similar in a very broad  sense. For example, the police there [in  India] are paid next to nothing. Police here  are heftily paid. So how the police treat a  poor woman will be very different there  than here. There is a kind of qualitative  difference although it is informed by the  same ideology. The strategy always starts  from where people are. Over there, a woman  who's destitute is destitute, there isn't any  way for her to get out of it.  Gogia: There are coping strategies to  that...  Agarwal: [Women in India] have to depend completely on their own resources,  whereas this is not the case here. For example, a social work school there can close  itself down and go on out and do the work  which is necessary.  Gogia: They do that?  Agarwal: Yes, absolutely. They went to  the   earthquake area and spent a whole  bility lies is to me a class question. The  creativity and the organizing is great but  why should prostitutes be second class citizens? Why should their children be hiding  under the bed traumatized outoftheirminds?  If you have a social program for them, on the  strengths and the sweat of the social workers, it's very impressive but why should  there be that misery in the first place?  JUSTICE, CONSCIOUSNESS  Gogia: What were the priorities of the  Indian women?  Agarwal: Their priority was to have a  better justice system. There is one group that  does a fair amount of litigation. They want to  really change the mindset, the rootedness of  so-called tradition, religion, communalism.  It aims to change that through legislation.  [Their work] is important but doesn't  do much at all to change everyday life. Enforcement only happens effectively if the  ideological basis changes. What is needed is  a consciousness change in a whole battery of  people who have historically and currently  used any or all possible combinations of  oppression of children, of minorities, of  women, of the lower castes. That is what  needs change, drastic change. What needs to  change is the unfair distribution of wealth,  the political partiesand the corruption. There  wasn't much discussion about economy or  the economic planning of the labour force.  When you're talking about women,  you're talking about sixteen-year-old  gions and fundamentalism and communalism, women's position in their religious community. Fundamentalism was quite a big  issue with so many communal riots in the  Ahmedabad in Bombay.  Gogia.-Wastheremuchdiscussionabout  [Indo-]Canadian women and fundamental-  Agarwal: Their issue was more of racism  which Indian women had first found it hard  to understand.  Gogia: That must have been interesting.  Agarwal: Yeah. What is this beast anyway? Sometimes we talked about it a littlebit  outside.  Gogia: Not within the conference?  Agarwal: Everybody mentioned racism  as a very important category to look at when  you're talking about working here. It is still  a difficult thing to comprehend not knowing  the context. I told them some of us have left,  but we are still your sisters.  Gogia: It seems to me that for a conference like this it would have been useful to  have more South Asian women from Canada.  Agarwal: Yeah, but it would look like  Indo-Canadian content. Women in India  would not have seen women from here as  Canadian unless they were white. It is hard  to appear there [in India] and say we are  Canadian. But doing that has a very astounding effectofopeningupdialogue. There  are possibilities of really doing solidarity  work. They know you from somewhere in  terms of the collective consciousness and  "Other than a very global idea of patriarchy, nothing puts Indian women in a position where  they could learn anything from people here. I think we could learn something from them."  - Pramila Agarwal  Ontario where they had asked people how  they confronted violence. What gets understood is really limited if one doesn't understand the social milieu in which you are  talking or listening.  Gogia: How effective was the exchange  to do with Canada and India?  Agarwal: I don't think it was effective at  all. Other people got something out of it but  you really did have to have a pretty good idea  of the terrain you were talking about. The two  terrains [India and Canada] were so different. Certain things happen in the same way  because "women are women" at least biologically speaking.  Gogia: Patriarchy exists here and there.  Agarwal: But the shapes and forms it  takes are unrecognizable and the ferocity  with which it shows itself here [in Canada]  and there [in India] are also very different  and the state structures are very different.  This is welfare state. India is not. Other than  a very global idea of patriarchy, nothing puts  Indian women in a position where they could  learn anything from people here. I think we  could learn something from them.  COMMUNITY LESSONS  Gogia: What kind of things?  Agarwal: In terms of organic growth of  community work. What is community organizing? How do you develop a community  that has organic integrity? There is such a  complete dependency on the state for day to  day life.  Gogia: ...for women here in Canada.  week or two. All their students were doing  work there. Can you imagine something  like that happening here?  Gogia: It wouldn't happen here at all.  Agarwal: [T]he institutional studies [in  Canada], they talk about flexibility. In actual practice they are very rigid. Which  professor here can even dream of saying,  "We're closing this institution. We have a  natural disaster here or a social disaster  here and people are going to go and do  counselling, do support work." This is what  was happening during communal riots in  India. Social work students went out, got a  field placement. It was part of their training  as social workers.  Gogia: What kind of strategies were  Indian women coming up with [at the conference], or were they even discussing strategies?  Agarwal: There is no social service  agency there which provides services without organizing. Organizing the community  is the basis and service is the second step. So  "community" and "community issues" are  defined by people who are themselves suffering through it.  Gogia: There seem to be much more  innovative stategies of dealing with their  lives and situations than there are over here  because the focus over here has been so  much on the state and what the state can  provide.  Aganual: This may be true but also it  does not mean that the state should not be  involved. Otherwise, it is all on volunteer  labour that people live. Where the responsi-  women, you think of these young girls who  are subjected to, out of nowhere, a mass  rape, because a university is going to change  its name! The total dissociation of this from  a woman doing her work in the rural communities, working in the village, walking  from the well to her house. At night, in the  section of the village where the lower caste  live, all the women get raped and you say  why? Because miles and miles and miles  away, a university is going to get its name  changed.  Gogia: What's the connection?  Agarwal: Well you tell me...The connection is that the upper caste is going to make  compensation. That is really the whole notion of violence. It's completely incomprehensible, except in the minds of a group of  men who can insult another group of men  by raping women. And then you add the  variables of caste to it as well, ruralness to it.  Where is the consciousness one wonders?  Gogia: What kind of actions are they  doing to raise the consciousness?  Agarwal: They are trying to raise consciousness primarily through women power.  In this whole village there are 5000 women.  How do you provide security? To take those  actions upon yourself, it always has to be  collective action. That is where you need  advocates because people who are living in  one place do not have access to travelling 20  miles to the police station.  FUNDAMENTALISM, RACISM  Agarwal: There was something we forgot about—the expression of different reli-  historical consciousness. It provides focus. It  provides sensitivity and it provides reasons  to be together.  Gogia: That's why I think it would have  made more sense...  Agarwal: Yeah, but nobody would have  done that because there is no context in the  Indian contingent to receive South Asian  people from here as Canadians. It would  have to be done under the auspice of South  Asian women getting together. The South  Asian diaspora would look like say, "I am  from Guyana, three generations ago," then,  "I'm from Trinidad" or, "I'm from Uganda."  There is a forgetfulness [that we are all  South Asian] there on their part because they  have too much to do. But that can change.  I j ust described in two or three sentences  the life of a South Asian woman here who  gets up in the morning exactly at the same  time [as women in India] do and does breakfast, and maybe instead of having to be at  work by 5 she has to be there by 7:30. And  you have women in British Columbia who  work picking berries you are picked up at 4  in a truck to be at work by 7 o'clock. Three  hours of commuting. So, that shows that  we're not very different [from each other]  because of our very marginal location here,  we have a lot in common with [them].

Feature  Interview with Akiko Carver:  In whose military?  by Michiko Mochizuki  During the International Women's Day  March, I had the pleasure to meet Akiko Carver.  She is a 17-year-old Japanese-American woman  active in race issues, women's issues, politics,  and lesbian and gay rights.  Michiko Mochizuki: Since the gulf war,  American politics and media have elevated  the issue of women, lesbians and gays in the  military. On the surface, equal opportunities  appear to be a positive step for society, yet in  your speech at the March on Washington  rally you challenged this, and pointed at the  dark side to this whole issue. Could you  elaborate on this dark side?  Akiko Carver: This was a three and a half  minute speech to one and a half million  people. It had to be simple and concise. The  people controlling the gay movement and  the push for lesbians and gays in the military  are white middle class men. From conversations with some of the march organizers,  their agenda was to take the focus away  from sex, and drag queens, butch-dykes,  and AIDS, and to depict the movement as a  group of patriotic citizens—ail-American  men and women.  For them there is nothing wrong with  seeking the right to serve. Yet, simply put,  sixty percent of the front line soldiers are  non-whites. These same non-white soldiers  are being used to oppress other non-whites  in "Third World" countries. True, many of  those involved in this movement [fighting to  include women, gays and lesbians in the  military] are non-whites. But it is because  they feel that this is one of the only steps out  of poverty available. I feel that if we chose a  movement to stand behind, we need to get  our priorities clear. It is more important to  address the barriers to the social movement  of non-whites, than to getting women, gays  and lesbians in the military.  It is a fact that there are few educational  and employment opportunities available to  non-whites. This is the issue.  Mochizuki: Media has made much about  women in the military during the Gulf War.  What are your thoughts about women in the  military?  Carver: As far as women pursuing equal  rights in the military, this is also not a critical  issue for me. It is not that I don't care about  my privileges as an American woman, but  because as an American I have the power to  oppress. Also, having a diverse military  doesn't change the fact that it is there to kill  Third World people. The issues are much  deeper than merely quotas in the military.  Also if we look at media images of  women in the military, they do not show  women in powerful roles, but rather them  hugging their kids goodbye. Even if women  were allowed in, it is still not publicly accept-  new and  gently used books  Fei  Philosophy - Poetry  Native - General  Open daily 11am-7pm  Coffee Bar  1020 Commercial Drive  Vancouver BC V5L 3W9  (604) 253-1099  Bonnie Murray  Cynthi* Brooke  Gay men have access to much of the  resources and privilege. For example, in  D.C. the Women Walker Clinic is a Lesbian,  Bisexual and Gay clinic. It gets most of the  AIDS funding in the city. Yet, the Abundant  Life Clinic, run by the Nation of Islam (A  black Nationalist Islamic group)—in a city  that is eighty-five percent black—gets very  little support. The gay clinic gets most of the  funding. Gays must take their privileges and  ensure that other marginalized communities, without such access, are helped.

It is  assumed that it is dangerous for v\  be in powerful positions, and v  twisted so that this career fits the traditional  role stereotype for women.  Clinton made many other promises to  activists on the campaign trail, not just the  military issue, such as universal health care.  These are 'real' issues for lesbians, gays, the  poor, and women.  Mochizuki: Your bio notes that you have  regrets about your involvement with ACT-  UP (AIDS Coalition toUnleashPower). Why  is this?  Carver: Well, I think that there were  many positive elements to ACT-UP, but on  the whole, for me the positive do not outweigh the negative. It is a gay male organization, and all the focus has been on men;  women and AIDS have never been its priority. Also, I heard about and witnessed the  racism in the New York City chapter. Obviously there is a need for AIDS research for  gay men, but this ignores a large portion of  the population.  (National Gay and Lesbian Task Force). I  have met many non-white women around  the country, with great ideas, the privilege of  education to articulate these issues, and many  middle-class women with money. If we had  a focus group, a voice, we can begin to work  to propose issues and bringconcrete changes  in things like welfare reform, AIDS awareness, health, and immigration policies.  We have not been very active. We have  great ideas, and may write a book, here and  there, but we are a community, not a movement. We believe that if we hang together  and talk together all will be well. But, it  won't.  I want a group, not just for radicals, but  something my mom can be aware of and  bring home. We need new tactics. We must  use many means: demonstrations, protests  and disruptions. I want a credible movement. I want a group to clearly articulate  what we want, to focus. We can write all the  theories, analysis we like about sexism etc.,  but we forget that we can ask for change. The  personal is the political, but also the political  is the personal. It is our own internalized  baggage which stops us from asking for  what we need. This is what I hope for the  future.   Michiko Mochizuki is a Japanese-Canadian  lesbian and a graduate of Simon Fraser  University.  Mochizuki: Media statistics indicate that  the incidence of AIDS among women has  risen over recent years. In your experience  has there been any attempt to remedy the  shortfall of attention to AIDS awareness for  women?  Carver: None. There is no focus on  women. All focus has been on "Well, use a  condom." This.ignores the fact that often,  women do not have enough power in a  relationship to ask for this. Follow this with  just a token focus on the growing number of  women contracting it. Also, the Black and  Latino populations in inner cities have always been disproportionately affected by  AIDS. But there has been no focus on it in  these communities, and there will not be,  until white women in the suburbs get it.  Mochizuki: Given that there is an apparent void of groups in the USA around which  women can rally, what solutions do you  propose? Also what would you like to see in  the future?

V0S 1E0 Feature  Canada's elitist taxation system  Where is the wealth?  by Ellen Woodsworth  In 1992 the Royal Bank of Canada made  a profit of over $63 million, but paid zero  dollars in taxes. A Royal Bank teller in British Columbia making $25,000 paid $5,732 in  taxes.  This is an example of the way wealth is  created by women, even though we are  poor. Our wealth goes to the corporations,  but does not come back to women in the  form of social programs.  Over the past few years, the mass media, owned by corporations and the federal  government ha ve been telling us about Canada's huge deficit. The federal government  tells us that in order to reduce the deficit it  came from increases in government spending since 1975. (see pie chart #1)  According to theStatsCan survey,over  8,300 Canadians who earned $50,000 a  year took advantage of existing loopholes  and didn't pay any income taxes in 1991.  In the same year, twenty millionaires paid  less than $100 each in provincial and federal income taxes. The federal government  The tax burden to pay for social programs and the deficit is not being shared by  corporations. Between 1961 and 1992, the  percentage of tax dollars that the government received from individuals jumped  from 32% to 50%. During the same period,  the percentage of revenue from corporations dropped from21%to7%. (seechart2)  In 1992,93,405 corporations made $27  billion in profits, yet paid no taxes. More  than $140 billion in corporate profits have  gone untaxed in the last nine years.  "At a time when Canada has more  than a 12 percent unemployment rate, and  T-%   trfiJUkfc  Distribution of the tax burden  next February they will most likely severely  cut social programs including those to  women, seniors, the poor and aboriginal  groups.  If the federal government doesn't spend  the wealth that we have created in our paid  and unpaid jobs on programs for women,  then we are going to see and feel the status of  women deteriorate even more. Jobs that  would be lost because of cuts to social programs are mainly held by women; and the  services are often provided especially by  women for women, children and the elderly. Jobs lost due to cuts to social programs  are held mainly by women, who do much of  the work anyway in the home without pay.  This contributes to the continued undervaluing of women's contribution to the national economy.  Canada is a wealthy nation. As a women's movement we have based our struggles  on the rightof all to share the wealth equally.  If Imperial Oil (ESSO)  paid their 1992 back-  taxes of $1,577 billion, it  could create 600,000  childcare spaces, build  54,000 coop housing  units, or fund a national  dental program for  children.  Breaking down the causes of the national debt  must axe the family allowance program, reduce unemployment insurance payments,  and claw back old age programs. And the  government tells us it doesn't have the money  for a national child care program among  other programs that we need and pay taxes  for.  All of these spending cuts are aimed at  undermining, under the guise of paying off  the deficit, the principle and practice of universality of social programs for all Canadians. Even the BC government has jumped on  the bandwagon and is cutting crucial dollars  from health programs and education - structures aimed at the prevention of illness or  preparation for the future - which in the long  run save money by providing people with  the tools the take care of themselves.  It is in fact tax breaks, not public services  and social programs, that have contributed  most to the national debt. A 1991 Statistics  Canada (StatsCan) study revealed that half of  our national debt was caused by tax breaks  and loopholes given to wealthy individuals  and corporations, and forty four percent was  created by high interest rates. Just six percent  has said it must cut social spending to pay  off the deficit, but at the same time it refuses  to make the wealthy pay.  Does that make sense or even sound  economics given the amount of tax dollars  corporations and wealthy individuals get  out of paying? Don't corporations and the  wealthy benefit from social spending on  education, roads, sewage systems, police  and fire systems?  If Imperial Oil (ESSO) paid their 1992  back-taxes of $1,577 billion, it could create  600,000 child care spaces, build 54,000 coop  housing units, or fund a national dental  program for children.  If Alcan Aluminium pay their US $955  million of deferred taxes in 1991, imagine  what else might be possible.  Canada's economy has been growing  economically over the last forty years, and  that's not including women's unwaged  work. If that were counted, the growth rate  would have been much higher, as a study  released by Statistics Canada last month  showed. Women's unwaged work in the  home has been estimated by StatsCan to be  worth 40 percent of the GNP per year.  Despite the overall economic growth,  the wealth in Canada is being concentrated  more and more in the hands'of a small  number of corporations and individuals.  Fewer and fewer jobs are being created, and  social programs continue to be cut.  hundreds of thousands are dependent upon  services which are being cut to the bone  because of a deficit "crisis", Canada continues to have the lowest coporate tax rate  of. ..any industrialized country in the world,"  says Mary Anne O'Connor, co-chair of the  Ontario Coalition for Social Justice.  Not only are the corporations not paying their taxes, but they are also using the  mass media and lobbyists to force the government to further impose social program  cuts, programs the government could easily  afford if the corporations paid their fair  share of taxes!  As Professor of Tax Law (York University) Neil Brooks points out, "the government should not be permitted to touch one  social spending program that generally benefits the poor and the middle-class, until it  has repealed the inequitable and inefficient  spending programs in the tax system, that  almost exclusively benefit the rich and large  corporations".  The federal government is now in the  process of a major reworking of all our social  programs after only eight days of public  hearings. No hearings were held west of  Calgary.  The Liberal government intends to push  through legislation in the fall to implement  social policy changes, which will end or  fundamentally affect universality of services and programs. In the 1995 budget due  We have been in the leadership of the movements that won medicare, pensions, unemployment insurance and welfare, and the  right to have government funding women's  organizations and centres.  At this point in our herstory, it is necessary to join together with other social movements in order to hold on to the gains that we  have made and to prevent further losses.  Many women's groups across Canada,  including the National Action Committee  on the Status of Women (NAC) and Women  to Women Global Strategies, are working to  expose the corporate agenda. At the end of  April women's and progressive groups will  rally to publicly demonstrate in many cities  against the unfair distribution of the tax  burden.  The Fair Tax Day demo in Vancouver will  be held on Monday, May 2 (the last day to pay  taxes) in front of the Revenue Canada office at  1166 Pender St. at 12:00 noon. Action Canada  Network (ACN) has a full list of corporations  that defer and or do not pay taxes. This list is  available through the ACN office 2524 Cypress  St., Vancouver, BC, V6J 3N2.

Black women against male violence  Fighting back, defining a space  by Keisa Campbell, Elvenia Grey  and Dega Omar   Following is a discussion among three Black  womenfrom different communities whoall work  in the shelter movement. They talk about violence against Black women and its specific impact on Black women in their communities—  particularly about the perceptions in those communities of male violence and work against it, as  well as what hinders Black women leaving abusive situations from seeking help in the various  shelters, transition houses and women's cen tres.  They also talk about their work and the on-going  struggle tomake the shelter movement accessible  to Black women and other women of colour.  Working in the shelter movement  Grey: The work I do here is no different  from the work I used to do in Jamaica. But I  didn't have a fancy name like feminism, I  just knew I was helping young women.  When I came here in 1989, I packed  every month to go home because of the  abuse I faced as a domestic worker. [My  third placement was] with a woman who  was a professor at UBC. That was good,  because she allowed me to live some place  else. It was fine until I started volunteering at  Rape Relief. She was upset because I was  getnngstronger.GettingconnectedwithRape  Relief changed my life—not only for myself,  but for other Black women.  I now work at Rape Relief as paid, full-  time staff and [also] do relief at Nova House.  I'm the only Black woman on staff at Rape  Relief, and for a long time, I've been the only  Black woman in a lot of transition houses.  I'm glad to see more Black women coming  in...Dega was in my training group, she's  one of the first other Black women, [laughter]  Omar: I was just thinking about that-  Grey: That was after I spoke at Take Back  The Night.  Omar: Your speech was so good, I was  inspired by you. Before that, I considered  myself a feminist, but I wasn't involved in  the women's movement. I didn't like it, I  didn't feel like I belonged. But I would read  books written by women of colour, Black  women in particular, like Angela Davis, Alice  Walker—I liked her then—and bell hooks.  Then I saw you speak. That had such an  impact on me. I thought, "There are Black  women that work in shelters, I can work  there too! I should work there! Because we  live here too, we should have a place to go if  something happens to us."  Grey: That's why I did it, I wanted other  Black women to see they could leave the  situation, they could come into a transition  house. That it was OK, they would find  other Black women there.  A lot of Black women think, "I don't  want to go a white women's organization."  They don't see it as, "I'm going to step into  this white women's organization and make  changes." That's what I want to see happening, because if we don't change it, it's .not  going to change.  Omar: I think we should start our own.  Campbell: Yeah, it'd be good to have our  own shelters because, from what I see, white  women have the power and there's no way  they're going to relinquish it. I was the last  person hired, so I have no power.  Omar: Are there other women of colour  working there?  Campbell: Yeah. Elvenia is really feisty,  and when we have meetings, no one bickers  with her. But I'm much more passive and I  get walked over a lot. It's frustrating.  [Also,] we're not full-time staff. Usually  I work by myself, on shift, so I have no  connection to any of the other workers, let  alone to the women of colour workers. I  really feel isolated.  To really help Black women, I would  want our own shelter.  Grey: I don't see that as the solution.  Why have ten transition houses when we  could have one good transition house? They  take a long time to start off, and it takes  money to do it.  Omar: It's important that we network  with each other and talk about how to reach  out to our communities. That's the hard part  for me.  I do see your point about staying in  white organizations and changing them, but  it takes work. It takes so much work to  "It's important that we  network with each  other and talk about  how to reach out to  our communities.  That's the hard part for  me." ■ Dega Omar  educate white women—even though that's  not my intention—because whenever you  talk about making the place accessible to  women of colour, about that being part of  the work, you have to explain it.  Grey: If they want education, they can  get books, [laughter] It's not my place to  educate anybody.  Omar: No, I won't either. I work with  two women of colour and we support each  other. We relate on the issues we're dealing  with in our communities, how hard it is to  reach our communities and not always be  counselling white women. Not that I mind  that, but I'm also there for women in my  community.  • Grey: Once, I was asked to a Board  meeting to talk about the organization. I  wasn't swearing, I wasn't yelling, I told  them about the diversity of women who  for yourselves." He had just found that out.  [laughter]  Omar: Some transition houses do try to  ensure women of colour feel comfortable—  that they can make the space their own, cook  their own food, watch their own films.  Grey: Shelters do try to address their  racism now. But it's not just the racism of the  organization, it's the racism of the other  women in the house.  Omar: Yeah, I've seen these white  women complain about women of colour  getting better treatment because, for example, South Asian women get to watch Indian  movies. They can't understand that. That's  "reverse racism."  Campbell: There was an Asian woman  stayingat Nova Houseand the whitewomen  didn't like the food she cooked, because it  "stank." She felt uncomfortable cooking, she  would stay up in her room, she was totally  isolated. Her English wasn't that good, and  they couldn't understand her, so they  wouldn't talk to her. It was horrible.  Grey: I experience racism from women  who come into the house too. I've had women  come to me for counselling and say, "I have  a Black friend," or "I used to know a Black  man in school." And when the abuse is done  by a Black man, the first thing they tell me is,  "I don't want to be prejudiced, but it was a  Black man..."  Omar: I had a weird thing happen to me  like that. A woman who had been abused by  a Somali man came in. She saw me and said,  "Where are you from?" I said, "Somalia."  And she said "Oh my god!" and freaked out.  Campbell: It's hard to work at Nova  House, because [the clients are] all white  women. The minute they see me, dreadlocks  Black woman, they're like, "How come she  has that kind of nasty hair, etc." So many  residents at Nova House just won't deal  with me.  Omar: How do you deal with that?  Campbell: I try to read them when I meet  them. I read their body language and watch  how they react to me. If they're nice, I'm nice  and I'll work with them. If they're racist, I  won't—I don't think I have to. We had an  incident where some women were asked to  leave, because they were just out-and-out  racist. One woman's child liked me and  wanted to play with me. The white mother  would say, "Come here! Don't play with  Omar: We all have different experiences.  Your experience is that you can challenge  your collective. But some of these organizations, which are supposed to be collectives,  are supposed to be feminist, have hidden  hierarchies. And it takes a long time to get at  that hidden, hierarchical power structure.  It'sharder to get at underlying racism, where  the newer women of colour get to do most of  the work.  You're supposed to be grateful as a  woman of colour to be there. Like, "You're  lucky to have this job." It's more like, "You're  lucky to have us." We put up with shit to  stay, and it's not their organization. They  really do believe that it's theirs. When I say,  "I can't wait till women of colour are the  majority working here," they're just like  "Eek!" [laughter] They can't even imagine it.  Grey: When the place I'm working for  started to employ women of colour and we  started coming together, they'd freak.  Omar: They are afraid of losing their  power a s white women, a s a white women's  organization, even though they'll say they  aren't. Some of them try to be honest and  say, "Yeah, I am scared. There's three of you  sition houses. Before I left Rape Relief for a  year's break, I had seen two Black women in  the space of about two years. Since I went  back to work in September, I've seen more  and more. I've probably seen about seven  Black women come into Rape Relief, which is  good. And I've seen a couple more at Nova  House.  Campbell: I haven't seen a lot of Black  women come through Nova House, I've only  seen two. The first time I met one Black  woman, we sat down in the office and chatted all night. She was so used to being in  crisis. It was really sad to see. And Irealized  that a lot of us are like that—we are constantly  in trauma and it becomes the only way that  we can be.  Omar: I work at the Surrey Women's  Centre Society as a counsellor. I haven't seen  any Black women yet there—there's a couple  and they see another counsellor. It takes a  long time to get around that there's a counselling centre, free of charge, for all women. The  women that have found out, in this first year,  are all white women, of course. I want to  network with the African immigrant associations and let women know tha t they can come  there.  if  I Fi'GK^^B  X Ctntritutet^J  tkc Liberation i|  a  I  or aLL vonan  V  and 5o victorY  J  is bor* even ih  W  the, darkest h«M^  now, the thought of having five of you is  scary." Because we challenge them so much.  It really helps if the women of colour  that work in these organizations support  each other. If I have something that's bothering me, I talk to the other women of colour  and we raise it together. We support each  "...that's also why Black women don't go to the cops, that's why they  don't want to call—they think the rape crisis centres are connected to  the police." - Elvenia Grey  come in, and how to meet these women's  cultures—making sure that the food that  they eat is there, not forcing them to eat  white people's food, etc. They sent back  word to the executive director that I was  "rude," and told him if he didn't get me in  line, he was going to lose his job. He called  me and said, "I understand, because my  partner is a Jamaican woman." He started  telling me about ackee and saltfish! I was so  mad. I sure showed him where to stuff the  ackee and saltfish! [laughter] I said "If you  think this is going to drown what I tried to  say, I'll walk."  Omar: There's a male director at a transition house?  Grey: A white man! He's left now. He  said, "I think you women need to handle it  her! Come here!" Wouldn't let her child play  with me! Luckily, they got kicked out.  Grey: As long as they keep it out of my  face, that's fine. I'm there to work and I'm  there to support them, as long as they keep  the racism out of my face. That's how I deal  with it. I'm myself. Too bad if they don't like  it. I don't even take time to study them, I just  come in and do my stuff. Either they partake  of it, or they don't.  Omar: It's good you're supported at  Rape Relief when you do that. Why should  you take racist abuse from a woman you're  trying to help?  Grey: That's why I'm not scared to speak  up—I know my collective is behind me. It  makes a difference. But how many Black  women have the security that I have?  other in that way, and they'll back me when  I have to confront someone or talk about this  or that.  Grey: It was easier to deal with white  women when I was by myself because I  didn't have to consider the consequences for  other women of colour. Now I have to weigh  my words, because although they can't get  to me, they can take it out on other women of  colour.  Omar: That's why you have to be connected. You have to make the space to get  together as women of colour, and they have  to know it.  Black women and male violence  Grey: More and more, I'm seeing women  of colour and Black women come into tran-  Campbell: The two Black women I have  seen have been about 30 years old and under.  I think, Black women my mum's generation  would never, ever set foot in a transition  house because they just wouldn't take their  business to outsiders, especially to white people.  Omar: If these women don't know that  there are Black women working, they're not  going to come. Violence against women is  different in different cultural contexts. Black  women don't like the way white women deal  with violence, or maybe don't feel like counselling fits into their ways, their culture.  There's also racism. Why would I go to a  white racist woman for help? If the choice  seems to be between that and abusive men in  the cultural environment I'm comfortable  with, I'm going to stay and just talk to women  that are in my family.  A lot of the Black women who come to  the shelter are abused by white men. I have a  friend who has been abused by a white man.  She married him in Tanzania, where she  grew up, to come here. She came from a  really poor background, so marriage was a  way to get out, to get to Canada. He tried  everything to deport her when she left him  and went into a transition house. He took  away the children, even though he doesn't  care about them, he calls them "niggers." He  called her family back home and said, "Your  daughter is a prostitute, she's a drug addict..." Basically, he did everything in his  power to ruin her life. That's the kind of shit  that Black women who are with white men  go through.  Grey: To say "I'm married to a white  man," is a major deal. For this man to then  abuse you and for you to have to go into a  transition house. ..it's embarrassing to them.  Omar: And they're usually cut off from  their families because they married white  men. They're isolated from their communities.  Grey: To face Black people saying,  "Well, we weren't good enough for you..."  is hard. They'd rather keep it in.  Blackwomen also go through the "Black  woman, strong woman syndrome." I myself do. I think, "This is not supposed to  happen to me, I'm a Black woman, I can  take care everything, I can make it right  again." So Black women won't come to a  shelter, they'll stay in an abusive relationship until they can move out on their own,  and make it on their own. They aren't scared  to start all over again because they've had so  many beginnings. You grow up in your  country, you come here, it's a new beginning. You come out of domestic work, you  sta rt a new job, it's a new beginning. You get  your family with you, it's a new beginning.  You get into a relationship, it's a new  beginning...New beginnings are the regular thing. We start over ten times too many!  Omar: If the man is from the community, there's also pressure not to charge him,  not to take the family and community business to the outside world.  Grey: Black women don't want to report Black men's abuse, because they know  that they're going to be treated differently  from white men. So the men go on with  their behaviour.  Omar: And then they end up in hospital. That's a place we could go and introduce ourselves as Black women so they'd  feel comfortable coming to the shelter. When  I was working at a shelter, I remember one  woman from East Africa. She told me all the  time how happy she was I was working  there, she couldn't believe it.  Grey.The first timel sawa Black woman  come into the transition house, everybody  asked me why I was so happy. Her coming  in showed me that they are hearing about  transition houses. My fear was that Black  women weren't hearing.  This is what I want to get across—it's  OK for Black women to call the crisis line  and come into the transition house. The  more they come in, the more they're going  to see that there are Black women working  there. It's not a white women's organization, we don't want it to be that way any  more.  Although, that can work the other way  too. Once, we got a call on the crisis line, and  I recognized the voice. I had to let her know  that and told the woman who was working  withher, "I know this woman." The woman  said to her, "Elvenia told me she knows  you. She wants you to know she's adhering  to the confidentiality policy." She freaked  and asked for me not to touch her papers.  Which I didn't. There can actually be a fear  of Black women.  Omar: Yeah, the fear that we're going to  gossip about each other.  Grey: Because Vancouver has such a  small Black community. Sometimes, it's  OK for a white woman to know, because it's  not going no place after that...  Omar: They're never going to see her  again. Especially when communities are  small, women don't want to be known as a  battered woman, or as a woman who's been  raped. There's still a lot of blame—which is  everywhere—but when the community is  small, it's harder, because you risk losing  people that you depend on. If it was a larger  country, it wouldn't be such an issue, because you could pick up and gp to another  town where people speak your language.  There's not that option here.  Grey: When they have to meet somebody in other areas of their life, it causes  panic. I suspect I would panic, too. Abuse is  something that we're not proud about.  Omar: We're told it's not our problem,  that it doesn't have anything to do with  Black people. When I tell people in my community I work in a counselling house, the  men ridicule me: "What are you doing that  for? You think you're a white woman?"  Grey: I get that a lot.  Campbell: So abuse gets internalized—  it's the woman's fault.  Omar: There's that too, in my culture. If  a woman is abused, she may leave to go to  her sister's, but everybody will try to get her  back. The onus is on her to come back, rather  than on the to man stop being abusive. But  there's also a lot of support too, for the  woman. It's not: "Go home and take it," but  "Go home and we'll all negotiate."  Grey: My mum always talked back. But  even though she'd take up for herself and the  kids, she always wanted us to wait on our  own partners: "Make sure that you've got  his food cooked when he comes home, etc."  We were still supposed to take care of these  men.  Omar: My grandmother is a poet, and I  was just thinking about a poem she sent to  one of her daughters who got married when  she was really young, an arranged marriage.  The poem was all about internalized sexism:  if you do all these things, you won't get hit.  Make sure he gets this, and make sure you  do that. All about what she should do for  him, to be a good wife. As a mother, she  must have felt that was the only way she  could teach her how to be safe.  Grey: Back in Jamaica, most of the time,  the women would stand up to the men—  even if it was throwing a stone from afar and  taking off. The neighbours wouldn't care if  you were quarrelling, they'd come over to  help. They wouldn't let him kill you on the  street.  It's different here, it's more isolating. I  don't see the violence in the Black families  that I know—it's way behind closed doors.  "For me, issues of race  are part of who I am as a  woman. I see women  who are killed by hunger  as violence against  women." - Dega Omar  Again, it's the "Black woman, strong woman  syndrome." A Black woman just lives her  life. She's not going to fight for alimony,  she's not going to fight for child support,  because that's not what we're used to: "Man  leave, make life." Take care of your kids,  take care of yourself. So, I don't know about  violence here, the isolation make it harder.  Omar: In my community, especially in  Toronto, where there are a lot of Somalis,  violence against women has escalated since  moving here. The men aren't working,  they're depressed, their self-esteem has been  trashed, there's racism...and they take it all  out on the women.  The womenleteachotherknowif there's  a new one coming, they let her know about  911 here... [laughter] I see a lot of Somali  women help each other. They have a tight  knit women's community. It's not funded,  but they try to help each other, without  going to any organization.  A woman whose husband was beating  her all the time was told by another woman  about 911. She called and he actually got  arrested right away—which would rarely  happen to a white man+and he spent time in  jail. And he stopped being abusive when he  got out! The men stop, they go, "Well, this is  different country!" [laughter] No chiefs or  negotiating or anything—no, you get your  ass to jail!  Grey: But that's also why Black women  don't go to the cops, that's why they don't  want to call+they think the rape crisis centres are connected to the police. Domestic  workers, refugees, immigrants, they're  scared of getting into trouble with the law.  Omar: Yeah, they don't want their husbands or partners deported.  Grey: Because of their immigration status, they think, "If I go into a transition  house, I'm going to get into trouble." Which  is not necessarily true. Black women need to  know this. You don't have to get connected  with the cops, you don't have get connected  with immigration.  Omar: That's what transition houses  need to do, they need to print this information, in our languages, and give it to them.  How else are they going to know?  Grey: There's also the association of rape  crisis centres with feminism. I get that a lot.  Violence against women and race are connected. You're a woman first, before you  become a white woman, a Black woman, a  pink woman...and violence is done to every  woman, in every culture, of every class. But  being in a feminist organization,. Black people will say, "You've changed." I haven't  changed, I'm just stronger. They'll tell me  I've come here and, "Taken up white people'  attitude about feminism."  Omar: I don't follow white feminists. I  think there's a big difference, I don't think  we are all women together. For me, issues of  race are part of who I am as a woman. I see  women who are killed by hunger as violence  against women. Violence against women is  in that context, and I define it differently  than white women define it.  Grey: Of course it's different. But as long  as it's any kind of feminism, they're going to  tell you, "It's white people' story." We aren't  supposed to be like that, "that's not what  you were like in your country. They'll say  "You're losing yourself, you're getting rid of  your Blackness."  Campbell: Which is not true when you  look at our histories, Black slave women, for  example.  Grey: The values I have now, are the  values I came here with. The only difference  is that now I know how to stand up, how to  be heard.  As long as you're a feminist, "You're a  lesbian." It's not the sleeping together they  worry about. They worry about Black women  empowering each other.  Omar: Yes, that silences Black women.  Because being lesbian or bisexual is supposedly a negative thing. That attitude scares  Black women away from Black women who  will encourage them to get out of abusive  situations.  Grey: Once one has a feminist story,  they try to keep the others away. They fear  the force of Black women joining together.  Keisa Campbell is of Guyanese parentage.

Feature  Fighting the backlash:  False Memory Syndrome  by Robyn Hall   Recently the CBC Evening News broadcast a two-part series on False Memory Syndrome (FMS), the latest, most well-funded and  publicized attempt to discredit women survivors of child sexual abuse. The series consisted  of two 5-minute segmentsonconsecutivenights.  FMS is largely a fabrication on the part of  white middle and upper class men and their  wives, who see women's memories of sexual  abuse as an attack on the nuclear family.  Women and children who have come forward with their experiences of abuse have always faced denial and hostility. The difference  with the backlash in its latest form is the huge  amount of media attention "False Memory  Syndrome" has received.  The FMS argument goes like this: Many  women are using sexual abuse to explain their  adultproblemswhen there isno scientific proof  (according to the backlash) that child abuse and  adult dysfunctions are linked. "Radical" feminist therapists are to blame, victimizing their  porter interviews a therapist who validates the  process of recovering memories of childhood  trauma, but then follows a male teacher out of  court where he was convicted of molesting  students twenty years ago. The viewer is left  with a sense that there are two equal sides and  wonders who to believe.  What the segment does not address, however, is how the two "sides" are situated in  terms of a patriarchal history in which men  have always had unlimited and unquestioned  access to the bodiesof women and children. An  awarenessand recognition of this history would  drastically alter the media's ability to position  the two sides as parallel or as coming from  places of equal access to the power of voice.  Falsely posing as unbiased and objective the  media gives FMS lots of publicity and implicit  support  Survivors and our supporters are faced  with the challenge of how to respond to these  attacks, and their possible effects on the legal  system, the therapeutic community and our  [Aiii  V*  ^  i  <^  clients by "seeding" memories in their heads.  This is an attack on the nuclear family by the  therapy "industry" and the feminist community. They allow that child sexual abuse occurs  and should be taken seriously but, ironically,  they compare all these "false accusations" to a  witch hunt  The CBC documentary frames the issue as  a dichotomy, having two equal sides. On the  one hand, it suggests, there are the legitimate  victims of sexual abuse. On the other, there are  the legitimate victims of women's false memories about abuse. For instance, in one sequence,  the camera watches a survivor painting child  faces full of fear on huge cavasses, then flips  directly toa meetingof a Vancouver Chapter of  the False Memory Foundation. Later the re-  14  sanity without discreditingourselves and drawing more attention to the backlash.  The fact that the backlash is in full swing is  really a credit to the strength of the community  of survivors, the women who work with them  and the feminist community.  Feminist and lesbian groups were the first  places women felt safe to publicly share their  experiences, beginning in the 70s. With the  crucial support of women therapists, many  survivors have remembered and are working  through violations so severe nobody wants to  believe they happen.  FMS plays on the individual and collective  denial around child abuse. Its no surprise that  ritual abuse survivors are being specially  targetted, according to Carmen Dodds of  WA VA W. Support for survivors of ritual abuse  has even been called a "growth industry" by a  recent Fifth Estate program. The greater the  severity of the violence the easier it is to use  FMS to completely discount all stories.  The False Memory Syndrome Foundation  (FMSF) was formed in Philadelphia in 1992. Its  founders, Peter and Pamela Freyd, were confronted by their daughter who, at 33, remembered being abused by her father between the  ages of 3 and 16: Other key members are Harold  Lief, the Freyd's therapist, and Ralph  Underwager and Hollida Wakefield, a married  couple who consider themselves experts on  memory and abuse.  The restoftheorganization's members are  men and their wives, mainly white, well-educated and middle to upper class. They have  been confronted by their adult daughters with  the daughter's memories of abuse, but every  member denies the allegations. They have a lot  to lose. On presenting a good, non-pedophile  type image to the media a FMS newsletter says,  "We are a good looking bunch of people: greying hair, well-dressed, healthy and smiling.  Just aboutevery person...is someoneyou would  want to count as a friend."  With a catchy name, slick marketing and  connections to power FMS advocates have attempted to make a huge controversy over their  denial of abusing their children. But, Carmen  Dodds says, "no child lies about abuse. It is  virtually impossible to make up a memory."  FMS supporters miss the point when they say  the problem is in the minds of the survivor, as  abuse is a sexually violating act that happens to  a child's body. When memories come up the  events arebeing re-experienced. Remembering  abuse is so painful and disruptive of a women's  adult life it's hard to imagine anyone wanting  to make this up.  The validity of the memory research the  FMSF uses to support their position is also  questionable. Elizabeth Loftus, the "memory  expert" from the U of Washington, has devoted  her academic career to proving that memories,  sometimes the only evidence in child abuse  cases, are fallible. Her concern is to prevent the  conviction of innocent parents. She doesn't do  trauma-based research, though, or acknowledge findings that show that traumatic events  are stored in memory differently than  untraumatic ones.  Many psychiatrists do not fully acknowledge the validity FMS. The American Psychiatric Association is now asking the FMSF to take  the word syndrome off their name, as it is not  regarded as a disorder.  Further, only 7 months before forming the  FMSF, Underwager and Wakefield gave an  interview in Paedika, the pedophilia journal.  They said,"Paedophiles need to become more  positive and make the claim that paedophilia is  an acceptable expression of God's will for love  and unity among human beings." Dale  Drewery, the CBC reporter who produced the  FMS series, was given this information but  chose not to touch it.  When FMS first hit the media two years  ago many therapists, primary targets of the  FMSF, weren't very concerned. FMS wasn't  backed by research. It wasn't long, though,  before both therapists and survivors began to  take notice.  Therapists, many of whom worked hard  to educate themselves around sexual abuse, are  now being faced with the possibility of law  suits. The FMSF encourages its members to sue  therapists and make complaints to regulatory  bodies where possible. One woman who works  with ritual abuse survivors in the US has been  bankrupted by suits. Therapists are putting  even greater emphasis on taking detailed notes,  avoiding assumptions of abuse and leaving  conclusions about abuse history up to the cli-  Survivors have started coming to therapy  confused by media reports that make FMS look  like fact. One survivor I talked to had been  struggling to believe that she was abused by her  father and doesn't have many clear memories.  She saw an FMS article on the front page of the  Globe and Mail. The fact that the story appears  in a "respected" paper made her wonder if her  memory was false, "I already had enough  doubts, this made it worse."  Despite the controversy the facts haven't  changed. Says the Courage to Heal, the book  about healing for survivors of sexual abuse:  "One out of three girls, and one out of seven  boys, are sexually abused by the time they  reach the age of 18. Sexual abuse happens to  children of every class, culture, race, religion,  and gender. Children are abused by fathers,  stepfathers, uncles brothers, grandparents,  neighbours, family friends, babysitters,  teachers...mothers." They are also abused by  groups of people. We need, in safe situations,  to keep talking about our experiences and validating each other.  We also need to avoid the polarization of  this debate. In BC there are bad therapists and  few means of accountability when problems  arise. Also, memory and denial are complicated for abusers and the abused. Someabusers  may at some levels believe they didn't do anything. The same applies to survivors who have  recanted their accusations of abuse at FMS  conventions. It has to be understood that denial is a basic human survival strategy.  Daniela Coates is a ritual abuse consultant  and co-chair of the Backlash Committee, a group  opposing FMS and the backlash against survivors of sexual abuse. She says, "Our society is  structured so sexual abuse can happen; it produces the victims and perpetrators and the  denial process. The backlash to women's issues  has a direct correlation to the backlash to the  healing process which gave women strength to  voice their oppression."  More has been written about FMS in the  last six months than about sexual abuse over  the past ten years. According to Coates, FMS  allows the media, caught up in their own denial, to assert the "abusers definitionof reality."  The existence of childhood abuse needs to be  madevisibleagain from ourperspective. Those  involved in the healing process must be reminded of the support that exists in the community. These memories are real, not false, and  the work we do to heal is important  What you can do: There will be a march  and rally - Voices Against Violence- on Sat June  11 at 11:30 am. The proposed route is from the  Pacific Press Building, across the Granville St  Bridge, to the CBC Building, in order to take the  issue back to the media outlets that are misinforming the public. There are plans to have  similar marches in cities across Canada and the  US on the same day. Everyone who wants to see  an end to abuse is welcome so watch for posters, come out and join the march.  One survivor I interviewed urges  women to read about the issue; there are  many good in depth articles that put this in  perspective and counter FMSF's claims.

Feature   Rape Relief's 99 Federal Steps on Violence against women:  Change, not band-aids  by Mary McAlister   At the regional meetiiig of the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women, held  in Vancouver from April 8-10, the Vancouver  Rape Relief and Women's Shelter submitted a  proposal called "99 Federal Steps on Violence  Against Women" for discussion at NAC's  upcoming AGM.  Following is an edited version of Mary  McAlister's speech for the Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women Shelter discussing the final report of  the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women  and the 99 Federal Steps.  The problem of violence against women  is not news. The numbers of women being  attacked are outrageously high. Women with  the least amount of power are the ones most  vulnerable to attack and least equipped to  stop the violence in their lives. Men with the  most power in relation to them, either in the  family or in the professions, carry more credibility in the criminal justice system. Studies  and surveys done on violence against women  have only reinforced what anti-violence wom-  en'sorganizationshavebeen saying for years.  The question remains: what are we to do  about it in 1994?  Two sets of recommendations are before  us: the Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's  Shelter's 99 Federal Steps, by Lee Lakeman,  with Johannah Pilot and Bonnie Agnew; and  the final report of the Canadian Panel on  Violence Against Women.  The 99 Federal Steps directs all its recommendations toward the federal government.  Canada's legislators sit at the top of a state  hierarchy, which gives them the power to set  policies and laws to reduce violence and  improve the status of women. By not setting  such policies, the government condones violence against women and promotes its continuation. However, holding the government  responsible to make changes does not mean  that we think they are the sole proponents of  violence against women. We absolutely hold  each individual man responsible for his decision to attack a woman.  A Critique of the Panel Report  The description of violence against  women in the Panel's report was full, and  appealed to the urgency of the problem. So, it  was disappointing to find that its recommendations were so weak.  One recommendation is for collaboration in the form of "inter-agency" committees to coordinate services. Women's centres,  rape crisis centres, and transition houses are  lumped in with professional associations,  hospitals, doctors, psychiatrists, ministries of  social services, ministries of health, federal  government departments of health, welfare,  social services, Indian and Northern Affairs.  Rape crisis workers are set up as professionals in the field of violence against women.  We should like to be taken seriously as front  line workers with knowledge and experience  of women's lives, including our own. But  this reinforces the hierarchical set-up of our  society by implying that women need professional assistance to live their lives. Women  choose to call rape crisis centres because they  want to talk with another woman who is not  a professional so that there is less of a power  imbalance between them.  The recommendation also hides the  power relations which exist between these  groups, falsely equating front line workers  with state institutions and ministries. But  who is really serving the interests of women's  liberation? Women call rape crisis centres  and tell their stories because they are not  government agencies, because of their reputation for action to end violence. State institutions, on the other hand, have an abysmal  record of anti-woman activity. Likewise,  First Nations women mistrust the ministry  of Indian and Northern Affairs based on its  track record. And even if such ministries  were to take pro-women positions in their  policies, women simply do not want any  body to have power over our lives, benevolent or not. We want self-determination.  Finally, the coordinating committees  would set up new bureaucratic bodies to  deal with violence. We have more than  enough bureaucratic bodies in place now.  Better that we make the systems in place  work for women.  A major difference between the Panel  report and the 99 Federal Steps is that the  Panel recommends a vast system for treating victims. The 99 Federal Steps recommends social changes that give women  It is in contrast to  government initiatives  on "safer cities" and  "crime prevention"  which focus on  reduction of property  crime and violence  against people as an  excuse for law and  order.  enough power in their lives to prevent them  from being victimized.  The Panel would like to see national  standards for services to victims. But a set of  national standards for service delivery to  victims by members of professional occupations, could only promote women's one-  down position.  The Panel report suggests that resources  should be allocated equitably between services working with women survivors and  those working with offenders. This is a  surprising suggestion not only because the  amount of money involved to equally fund  programs for offenders might reduce what  is available for feminist services but even  more so because such programs for men  have not proven to be successful.  The "zero tolerance policy" model is  suggested by the Panel as something that  could be adopted by any group, organization, or institution. The zero tolerance model  fails in that it applies one model to different  kinds of situations—from individual men  to hierarchical institutions.  Both the Panel report and the 99 Federal Steps argue that the low status of women  in Canada is a major contributor to the  incidence of violence against women. Both  identify improvements in social programs  as essential to improving the status of  women. Where they differ is on the details  of how to make such changes.  The 99 Federal Steps calls for universal  daycare. The Panel calls for a national daycare plan whichasksforcoordinationamong  all levels of government and which encourages workplace childcare. A universal  daycare program establishes daycare as a  right for all women. Italso means the potential for national standards on quality of  care. Provincial and municipal programs  would likely mean daycare in those provinces and cities who can most afford it,  leaving poorer women out. Likewise  workplace daycare covers only those places  o f work which a re progressive or rich enough  to establish one. Women in low paying jobs  or unemployed women are left out.  The 99 Federal Steps calls for an adequate guaranteed annual income, establishing the right of all women not to live in  poverty. The Panel suggests that female social assistance recipients be provided with a  combination of social assistance and training or employment income, and that the  income of older women be supplemented to  ensure a reasonable standard of living.  Summary of the 99 Federal Steps  The first section recognizes the importance of feminist work in rape crisis centres,  women's centres, transition houses and national women's coalitions. It calls on government to fund these organizations by and for  immigrant women, disabled women, aboriginal women, and lesbians. Money should  include an allocation for consultation of  women's groups with each other. It calls for  the re-instatement of an improved Court  Challenges Program and for government  consultation with women's groups on any  plans fornew laws relatingto violence against  women.  The second section asks the federal government to approach violence against women  in their families as an issue relating to the  status of women in Canada. Women need  economic alternatives to staying in dangerous families. We also must have equal pay  and equal job opportunities, universal medicare, adequate pensions, universal daycare,  and adequate guaranteed annual income,  federal law to uphold women's right to control over our own bodies, accessible and  affordable housing, legal and social recognition of lesbian relationships, free access to  legal aid. Police must make their first priority calls for help from women in their homes.  Changes to immigration law including the  right for immigrant women to stay in Canada  should they report assault by sponsor husbands, and to give sponsored women landed  status at point of entry into Canada. The  federal government should release women  in jail for defending themselves against abusive husbands or partners. When men have  been convicted of wife assault, women must  have a legal mechanism for severing his  parental rights. Residential institutions must  change their structures to eliminate opportunities for male staff to attack women and  children and changes should include double  staffing. Universities and colleges must increasingly be subject to civil suits and public  systemic racism of the criminal justice system. "Any disadvantage of race or class  position complicates and intensifies an already severe gender disadvantage for  women. Within Canada that system of interlocking disadvantages and discriminations  directly support men in attacking racial minority women...No program to end violence  against women can be effective if it does not  disrupt and transform those power relations  toward equality." The recommendations  covered here include acknowledgement that  the disproportionate number of men of colour and aboriginal men in prison is not an  accurate reflection of who does and doesn't  commit sexist violence; a release and deferment program for the disproportionate  number of jailed aboriginal women and  women of colour, as they are certainly not a  threat to the public; a recognition in law that  racism compounds the effect of sexist at  tacks, translation and interpretation services  for women who have been attacked and  have to deal with the justice system; and  finally, adding gender to the definition of a  convention refugee.  The fourth section refers to the enormous power held by men in professional  positions and their abuses of that power.  When accrediting men with professional status can't be avoided, we should do so with  the following recommendations in play. Men  should not be given access to credentials  when there is any hint of abuse, and professionals should not be able to evade accountability by moving from one province to another. The federal government must appoint  inquiries and hold professional associations  accountablewhenaccused of protecting their  members from criminal investigations.  The fifth section asks the government to  reinforce the right of women to advance in  the workplace by fully integrating women in  every learning institution and job site under  the influence and control of the federal government. Violence against women in these  sites can be reduced by integration. Domestic workers and farm workers need labour  law protection including the removal of the  live-in requirement for domestic workers.  The sixth section is an answer to the  problem of unsafe communities. It is in contrast to government initiatives on "safer cities" and "crime prevention" which focus on  reduction of property crime and violence  against people as an excuse for law and  order. The government should instead focus  on changes addressing women's vulnerability to sexist violence. The 99 Federal Steps  calls for the decriminalization of prostitution and the dismantling of vice squads designed to manage prostitution. The federal  government should encourage the creation  of safe, effective and accessible transportation systems. We need stronger gun control  and a limit on the use of guns by police.  The seventh section on the criminal justice system seeks to redress the bias against  aboriginal people and people of colour, poor  people and women, as well as the privilege  conferred on men, especially rich white men.  It recommends changes in the appointment  of judges to reflect the diversity of the population. More feminist judges also need to be  appointed. Complaints about the judiciary  need to be publicly reviewed and contain  stronger disciplinary measures including the  ability to remove judges from their jobs.  Judges must not abandon their responsibility for determining matters of law and legal  fact through the use of professionals as expert witnesses who are hostile to women  and women's concerns. Crown council needs  adequate time and resources to properly  prosecute crimes of violence against women.  No single change suggested in the 99  Steps will succeed in ending violence without each of the others. Violence is systemic  problem and must be solved with a comprehensive solution. In addition, the 99 Steps  were written by front line workers based on  what's been written and said by women's  organizations from their years of work and  experience. It is a political document that  can be used to agitate for change by NAC or  by any member group.

MAY 1994 KIKIESIf  1974-1994  by Christine Cosby  Reading through back issues o/Kinesis can  easily become an addiction. While this monthly  20th anniversary feature cannot possibly do  justice to the immense herstorical record found  in the yellowed pages of Kinesis, here's a  glimpse in to the May issues ofl 974 and 1984. If  you ever want to explore the past 20 years of  Kinesis, drop by our office.  MAY 1974  MAY'80  KMMSiJ  The focus of the news and features in  this issue of Kinesis was around provincial  and federal governments and the status of  women. Kinesis printed excerpts from the  Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of  Women's (CACSW) assessment of the action/inaction of the federal government on  the recommendations.  The federal government also came under criticism for its preparations for 1975—  International Women's Year (declared by  the United Nations). Delegates from 75  groups across Canada were flown to Ottawa  for a one day consultation with the government's Inter-Departmental Committee on  IWY. Kinesis noted that only about ten of the  75 groups were primarily involved with  women's issues and the fight against sex  discrimination in society. Grassroots women's groups (such as women's centres) were  left out of the process.  In a letter to the editor, one reader returning from living in the USA writes, "I saw  a lot of changes in the ten years I spent south  of the border and was shocked to find that  very little has altered in BC in those years."  Women representatives from Vancouver Status of Women, the Childcare Federation, the NDP Women's Rights Committee  and Women in Teaching were gearing up for  the "Action for Women Conference." The  goal of the conference was to focus intensely  on strategy for the women's movement in  BC, especially with regards to lobbying the  provincial NDP government. Then, as now,  little legislation aimed specifically at meeting women's needs had been enacted.  The Media Action group's monthly feature in Kinesis reported a campaign victory  in May 1974. Responding to the group's  letter writing campaign, Benson & Hedges  Tobacco Co. withdrew a sexist advertisement from its publicity campaign. In the  company's apologetic letter conceding defeat, Benson & Hedges made one last advertising effort. The closing of the letter reads:  "Since we are trying to respond to your letter  in a socially conscious fashion, we hope that  you will support us in the future by encouraging your friends who smoke to use our  product."  This final letter made me realize that  at least a few things HAVE changed! After  bowling in the provincial championships,  one Kinesis reader wrote the following:  "We had been informed by the proprietor  of our bowling alley that we must wear  skirts and that said skirt must be no more  than six inches above the middle of the  kneecap. I must admit that the first  reaction from our group was laughter,  which then turned to absolute outrage that  in this day and age women were still being  suppressed and discriminated against."

MAY 1984  The cover story of Kinesis was the Vancouver Sta tus of Women's loss of core funding from the provincial (Socred) government the month before. Despite lobbying  efforts over the previous four months, the  government showed its preference for Expo  '86 and B.C. Place over women's groups  such as VSW. Additional lobby efforts over  the following months were not successful.  Provincial core funding was not returned  until after the Socreds were booted out of  government.  In addition to protesting the funding  cuts, Vancouver women were picketing the  Savoy movie house for its change from screening second-run films to pornography.  In the United States, women in Wisconsin were setting up a women's peace camp  to protest the escala ting arms race and Project  Elf. Project Elf developed the first-strike one  way transmitter for the Trident nuclear submarine fleet. Across the USA, a women-only  walk following the "white train" route  making tracks. The "white train" carried  nuclear weapons material across the country.  And internationally, the boycott of Nestle was (temporarily) suspended when Nestle agreed to demands to halt all its promotion of infant formula in the Third World. As  we know, the boycott is on again today.  The May 1984 Kinesis supplement  focussed on our bodies and how we feel  about them "... the pressures of lookism that  threaten women who don't conform." The  range of articles covered anorexia, bulimia,  being tall, fat fitness, tattoos, mastectomy,  and bathing suits. The introduction to the  supplement had this to say: "In some ways,  it is frustrating to have to accord the issue so  much time and energy. For so long, we have  been defined by our looks, allowed anxiety  about them to dictate much of our behav  iour, tried to prove that there's more to being  female than 'tits and ass.' It Would be nice to  let it go, to work on other things."  Regular arts columns in Kinesis at the  time included "Ruby Music." May's column featured singer and nightclub hostess  Ada Smith, more famously known as  Bricktop. The "Publications in Review" column introduced readers to Motheroot Journal, New Women's Times, and The Women's  Review of Books which all concentrated their  publishing efforts on reviews of literature  and art by women.  Protesting funding cuts to Women's groups seems to be a May  theme in the past issues of  Kinesis. Above is the first page of  the 1985 issue and to the right is  the cover of the 1990 issue. Arts  Interview with Flora M'mbugu-Schelling:  Keeping up the struggle  by L. Muthoni Wanyeki        Flora M'mbugu-Schelling is a Tanzanian  film-maker who recently moved to the US. She  was in Vancouver in March to screen her latest  film These Hands at the NFB's annual International Women's Day film Festival: Women and  Resistance, andat the New African Media screenings co-organized by the Black History Month  Committee and the Video In. Kinesis had the  opportunity to speak with her while she was here.  Lynne Wanyeki: Could you tell us something about the work you've done aside from  film-making—particularly as it relates to  women?  Flora M'mbugu-Schelling: In 1984, I  worked for a centre where we were trying to  provide contraceptives to women. That was  my first work with women. In 1985,1 was in  Nairobi for the NGO forum...I'vebeenable to  attend several women's workshops actually,  like the women's writing conference in Oslo  in 1986. Through all this, I came to understand that there's a lot we need to do to  improve the situation of women.  Wanyeki: How did you come to film and  video-making?  M'mbugu-Schelling: I don't do video, I  only do film. I studied film in Germany.  Wanyeki: Given the relatively low access  to film on the continent, what role do you see  your film-making as having?  M'mbugu-Schelling: I am a film-maker, I  am not a politician. I do a film as a piece of art  and hope that when people see it, they will  think about the things I show, that the policymakers will think about women and how to  improve their lives. My film achieves something then—but otherwise, I make film solely  as a film-maker.  Wanyeki: How do you choose your subject matter?  M'mbugu-Schelling: I choose anything  which interests me.  Wanyeki: Your film These Hands details  the lives of women working in a stone quarry.  Although the women are self-employed, the  work is very hard, for very little pay. Many of  the women shown are Mozambiquan refugees. Could you tell us how you came to  make this film?  M'mbugu-Schelling: Did you like the film?  Wanyeki: I liked it a lot. It was very  beautifully shot, and I liked that fact that it  was a very quiet film. And the spirit of the  women...so many films that are made about  Africa portray the subjects as victims. These  women didn't seem like that at all. I really  liked that...  M'mbugu-Schelling: African women have  always been portrayed as impoverished, malnourished, oppressed, helpless, like they can't  help themselves, as prostitutes or...their images have been so distorted. I'm tired of  always seeing the African woman as a mother  carrying a baby on her back. In the west,  people have been fed by TV propaganda  which portrays Africa in it's most pathetic  ways. I'm really sick and tired of it, it's always very shallow and the people are portrayed almost like animals. But when you  look at these women, you really respect them  for who they are and what they do.  Wanyeki: I noticed that one of the songs  the women were singing was about the assassination of Samora Machel. This brings up  the effects on women's lives of the systematic  attacks on the Mozambiquan government  and peoples by South African-backed terrorists. I know Tanzania has accepted many,  many people from Mozambique. Has there  been any organizing on the part of Tanzanian  women to condemn the situation in a broader  political sense? For example, right now, Kenya  is accepting a lot of Somalians into the country, and the government and women within  the country are trying to take steps to alleviate the situation in Somalia, because the  influx of people does put a strain on relations within the country...  M'mbugu-Schelling: These women came  into Tanzania a long time ago, not today or  yesterday. We still have refugee camps at  the border, which is very far away from Dar  es Saalam where this particular quarry is.  The UNHRC [UN Human Rights Commission] is doing work to help in the camps and  the government is supporting them, but the  situation is not the same as Kenya and  Somalia, or Uganda and Sudan right now.  Wanyeki: Although the film stood as a  quiet critique of the hardships imposed on  low-income women, I didn't get the sense  that any organizing was happening around  here, we're still alive, there's no need to give  up, we have to keep up the struggle in  whatever we're doing. I think the women in  the film showed that whatever you're doing,  no matter how hard it is, you can keep up the  struggle.  Wanyeki: How do you get funding for  your films?  M'mbugu-Schelling: I get funding from  development aid organizations.  Wanyeki: Are there many other women  film-makers in Tanzania?  M'mbugu-Schelling: There are, actually.  But whether they're doing films or not, that's  another question. A lot of people are struggling very hard to make their daily bread, so  sometimes even thinking of making a film is  beyond consideration.  Flora M'mbugu-Schelling  their working conditions. Could you tell us  anything about women and organizing in  terms of work in Tanzania—is it at a union  level, or at a self-help community-based  level or...  M'mbugu-Schelling: There are labour  unions, but these womenare self-employed.  But they're selling a product. This is a capitalistic society. They're selling a product  which costs a certain amount, so how can  you organize and want more pay? Who is it  going to come from? If they demand more  pay, above the market value, the buyers  won't buy. So, organizing is out of the  question. It's very simple, this is life, this is  how it is.  Wanyeki: So, when you said earlier that  you're not a politician, that you make the  film and just hope policy-makers see it and  do something about it, what do you think  should be done?  M'mbugu-Schelling: [laughs] I don't  know...what do you think should be done?  Wanyeki: More pay, better living conditions...  M'mbugu-Schelling: But that's also  needed here, Kenya, everywheVe. So, we  have to re-organize the global situation,  which is a very big task. My task is to make  a film, and that's a very big task for me. I  only hope what I am doing reflects what is  happening. I don't necessarily have an answer to what is happening. If things will  change, good, but if they don't, we're still  Wanyeki: Is film-making all that you do  right now?  M'mbugu-Schelling: Yes, it's how I'm  trying to earn my living. It's very hard, it's  barely surviving...but there's a need to have  Africans make their own films, there's a lot  which has not been put out. There's very  little coming out from Africa...  Wanyeki: Although in the past little  while, I've noticed more. I recently met a  woman from Zimbabwe, Charity Maruta,  who's also involved in film-making. And  Anne Laure Folly, the woman whose film is  being shown tomorrow night, was also in  Vancouver just a month ago. She does really  good work. So, it seems like there are more  women, but that they're isolated from one  another...  M'mbugu-Schelling: Yes, there are more  women, but I've never met these two  women...  Wanyeki: Do you go to the bi-annual  film festival in West Africa?  M'mbugu-Schelling: Yes, I was at the last  one, but I didn't see these women. You have  to have heard about somebody...And also,  the films done in video are shown in a  completely different places, which is a  problem...I'm looking forward to seeing her  work, Women of Niger, women talking about  protest and democracy, right?  Wanyeki: Yes, and there's another one,  Women With Open Eyes, which is a very good  overview of the different issues that women  are working on in four West African countries. It's a documentary, and she deals with  issues like arranged marriage, circumcision,  women's market work which is never calculated in terms of gross national product and  national economy and yet these women are  actually quite self-sufficient. She also talks  about their involvement politically in the  multiparty movement...  M'mbugu-Schelling: Yes, this is important information that people need to  know...so the women talk about circumcision?  Wanyeki: Yes.  M'mbugu-Schelling: Our people will see  a stop to circumcision when they realize  there are things to substitute what they were  doing before with, something they can continue to identify as part of their life and part  of their culture.  I personally think that circumcision is a  matter of choice, like being pro-life and pro-  choice. Nobody can tell me whether or not to  have an abortion. It's none of their business.  The same with circumcision.  Wanyeki: That's really interesting actually, because there are some women who are  now framing the fight against it that way...  M'mbugu-Schelling: You should not  judge things you don't understand. I think  you need to have western arrogance to judge  things you don't understand.  If you don't speak english, of course,  you're assumed to be uneducated. If you're  uneducated, it's assumed that you're not  able to think for yourself, to analyze your  own life. That's arrogance. Most people from  the west ask you questions that they think  they know the answers to already. They are  only trying to get you to answer what they  already have in their heads.  I've done a lot of films with women. I  always try to really ask my questions. And  so, sometimes, the answers are amazing. But  it depends on how I ask the questions. For  example, in my first film, Kumekucha, I'm  asking women to talk about their lives. I've  got very simple questions like, "why do  women get married?" The women'sanswers  are unbelievable! Because I genuinely asked  why. A western person would ask...  Wanyeki: ...do you think women get  married because dot, dot, dot...  M'mbugu-Schelling: [laughs] That's it!  Yes or no. I take film as art, so I find it very  difficult to make reportage, to make things  which are indoctrinating, I need a very subtle way of going into things. Maybe it's  necessary to be able to make statements, but  I find statements are indoctrinating.  Wanyeki: You don't think that art can be  indoctrinating too?  M'mbugu-Schelling: It should not be, it  should give freedom.  Wanyeki: But don't you think everything, from the way that a film is edited to  what content is shown, is indoctrinating, or  influenced by how you, the film-maker sees  it?  M'mbugu-Schelling: No, I think my films  leave it completely open to interpretation. I  prefer to be able to give those possibilities.  By allowing for diversity, we're able to embark on a discussion. But if a statement is  made, it's made.  Wanyeki: It's final?  M'mbugu-Schelling: The classic documentary gives you information from a certain point of view and that's it. But Africa  needs film-ma kers to portray a lot of things.  L.

MAY 1994 Arts  Review of Lee Pui Ming's New CD;  Emotional  landscapes  by Laiwan  NINE FOLD HEART  by the Lee Pui Ming Ensemble  Pochee Records  Vancouver, 1994  "My music is rooted in improvisation,  Chinese music and jazz. It starts from these  sources and proceeds to break their boundaries," says Lee Pui Ming.  By now, most of us have witnessed Lee  Pui Ming's dynamic performances (the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, last year's Racy  Sexy Exhibition, or at the UBC Museum of  Anthropology). We know her impassioned  stage presence, her confidence in her musical knowledge and her playful improvising  using the grand piano as piano, percussion  instrument or echo box. Lee's performances  were remarkable because visually her body  expressed as much as what we heard musically.  Lee Pui Ming is fast becoming one of  Canada's foremost contemporary pianists/  composers. With her recent CD release of  Nine Fold Heart Lee pursues her passion and  vision to contemporize Chinese traditional  and folk music by interpreting these into  modern musical experiences in a North  American context.  "I want to create a cultural expression  that is alive and vital and that speaks to  Chinese-Canadians hereand now," says Lee.  For me, this CD is a release—and a relief  that here is a body of work that expresses the  complexities and intelligence of a contemporary Chinese-Canadian experience. The  unusual way she interprets famous traditional tunes and the originality in her use of  traditional Chinese instruments is refreshing. It defies the simplistic exoticizationand  eroticization of "Chineseness" in the West  by presenting a profound interpretation of  emotional landscapes in the here and now.  Nine Fold Heart is intense. There is exacting musicianship from Lee and her ensemble, made up of members from the Vancouver Chinese Music Ensemble: Qui Li  Rong on pipa /Chinese lute, and Yu Zhi Min  on zhong ruan/Chinese guitar, Huang Ji  Rong on erhu/Chinese violin and Pan Jian  Ming ondizi/Chinese flute, with Vancouver  percussionist Salvador Ferreras. A wide  range of emotions are explored, transforming the comfort of the traditional into an  amazing labyrinthine weaving of landscapes.  The CD begins with a lively "Danse  Extravaganza" which uses as source material Xinjiang dance rhythms and music from  the Westernmost region of China. It is a fast-  paced adventurous trip thatreflects the music  from people who live along the Silk Road.  Even with the Chinese instrumentation, influences of Persian rhythm and melody can  be heard, showing the cultural exchange  between China and Central and West Asia.  "Tale of Three Snakes" is an original  composition featuring the three women of  the ensemble Qui Li Rong, Yu Zhi Min and  Lee. A highly visual piece with only the title  informing the story, this instrumental is actually very funny. Through the melodrama  of the interrelations between the three snakes  —the hates and loves, the intrigues, the  plottings and the foils—unfolds a tumbling  tale in my imagination guided by the intensity of the musicianship and the playfulness  of the images.  During a performance last year, the fast  pace of this work and the manic shifts to  hurriedly put the aluminum foil into place  on the piano strings or along the neck of the  zhong ruan at the right moment in the composition, certainly attained the desired musical effect. It also discouraged a  romanticization of tradition.  "Three Kingdoms" begins with a nostalgic source, a pipa classic titled "Ambushed  on Ten Sides" which has been a popular  Chinese tune for two thousand years. It  evokes for me the solitary dignity of the pipa  that quietly moves into a darker side with  Lee's piano. This is a composition about the  horrors of war. It also demonstrates Lee's  skill in weaving the traditional with the  modern. The contemporary feel of this work  connects the pain of war from the Three  Little  Sister' s  Book  & Art^-^poriiim  at 1221 Thurlow Street in Va^uver  is proud to present  the big sale.

Nine Fold Heart is the least "Chinese"  sounding work in a traditional sense. It is said  to be a work "that probes the layers of the  heart." Here, I hear a heart that is intricate,  uncontained, mysterious, fluttering...  A lively ode to the favourite Chinese fictional character, "The Monkey King Suite"  changes the pace with a playful rhythm. The  great Monkey King has long been a source of  inspiration for creativity for many. This is the  only suite in this collection where Lee uses her  experimental vocalisations of monkey-like  sounds and traditional Chinese opera to describe the scenario with much passion and  zeal.  Because it is reminiscent of popular Chinese street opera/plays, "Why Don't We Eat  Noodles?" is a work that departs from the  others. Written for the members of this ensemble it uses three different dialects of Chinese—  Shanghainese, Cantonese and Mandarin—and  expresses the chaos and fun surrounding the  inability to decide what kind of noodles to eat.  Within the vastness of China, noodles vary  from region to region just as the dialects vary.  This work celebrates this diversity, and although there is difference and debate, it also  celebrates the one basic necessity: food, which  through the pleasures of eating unifies differ-  On another level, the significance of  "eating" and food as a cultural marker in  much contemporary creative workby Chinese in the diaspora, and by Asians in  general, intrigues me greatly.  The last piece on this CD is "The  Grande Love Song." Its sources are a song  from a classic opera about the pain of  unrequited love, and an original Lee composition called "The Wedding," from her  firstrecordedcollectionMiMg.Leeskillfully  weaves the traditional with the original to  give this "love song" a life of its own.  Nine Fold Heart is a bold challenge to  the traditional, embodying the diverse  range of musical interests and expressions,  intelligent experimentation and a passionate fervour to contemporize Chinese Canadian musical experience. It probably  exemplifies the boldest challenge she has  given herself.  Lee Pui Ming and her Ensemble will be  launching Nine Fold Heart with a special  concert at the UBC Museum of Anthropology  on Friday May 13th at 8pm. Definitely a  performance not to miss.

Art SuppliEs  RecydEd papER pRoducistJ^ Arts  Review ofRenae Morriseau's Native Women: Politics:  Prisoners of democracy  by Viola Thomas   INDIGENI NATIVE WOMEN:  POLITICS  written and produced by Renae Morriseau  Motion Video Productions  Vancouver, BC 1994  Indigeni Native Women: Politics is a long  overdue video which explores the concept of  self-government through the eyes and experiences of First Nations women from British  Columbia. This video provides a very brief  historical overview of how the roles of aboriginal women have changed within aboriginal societies and demonstrates why aboriginal women are nothomogenous in their views  of aboriginal self government. The video consists of interviews with a number of First  Nations women, interspersed with black and  white photos. It begins with a number of  these photographs of children and women  from variousFirst Nations communities taken  by Greg Young-Ing (Cree) and David Neel  (Kwakiult). The photos are complimented by  the sound of a drum echoing in the background. The drum symbolically represents  the heartbeat of Mother Earth.  The interview sections are shot in colour.  The contrasting views of the different  women are presented without impeding the  dialogue from each of the women who shares  her viewpoint. An example of this is presented at the beginning of the video tape:  Mary Williams of the Lil'wat Peoples' Liberation Movement says "They don't talk territory, I talk territory. This is my territory, I  can go anywhere in my territory and make a  living."  Wendy Grant of the Assembly of First  Nations says "The inherent right to self-government is part of Section (35) under the  constitution now." By allowing each of the  women to articulate her thoughts in a non-  confrontational manner and present it that  way reaffirms how complex self-government  is forFirst Nations people to define. Tsi Beo'tl,  a Pacheencht Elder eloquantly states, "We  did not have laws as the Europeans brought  us. We were all raised from birth to respect  Mother Earth, the animals, each other, and  with respect, you don't need laws."  The video traces the impact of the Canadian federal government's colonial piece of  legislation called the Indian Act which was  Tthow-Hegewelth/Lavina White  first imposed on First Nations people in 1876  and is still in existence today.  Barbara Wyss (Squamish Nation) aptly  put it in this way "All of these changes just  marked a continual eroding of the role of  aboriginal women. It was the first piece of  legislation designed specifically for assimilation, and to systemically remove women and  their children from Indian status."  Mary Williams, co-founderof the Lil'wat  Liberation Peoples Movement and member  of the World Indigenous Collective says,  "Here wasadislocationof economies.There  was a time when we were able to provide  for ourselves. We didn't need to have or to  go to anyone outside our country, or even  outside our communities, to ask for food,  to feed our children, to clothe ourselves,  we were able to do that for ourselves. The  whole political thing is that they are being  funded by the very government tha t wants  to control us. We are prisoners of democracy."  Native Women: Politics is written and  produced by Renae Morriseau (Cree/  Saulteaux) who is originally from the  Peguis Reserve in Northern Manitoba.  Besides being an actress, Morriseau began  her career as a broadcast journalist in Winnipeg, for the MaMa Wi Centre. She became host, writer, and correspondent for  the Canwest/Global Network on the program First Nations. Morriseau has created  her own regular show for the network  entitled Indigeni. Besides initiatinglndigeni,  Morriseau won best documentary (1993)  for her production called Theytus Books,  about the Penticton-based First Nations  press, and honourable mention for best  cultural material (1993) for the production  Salmon Smoking at the Native American  Journalists Association. Morriseau sees this  version of Native Women: Politics as a work  in progress and hopes to expand this video  to an hour.  She says, "I didn't write this production for the aboriginal audience. All the  steps toward self government take different forms and are at different stages with  each First Nations community in Canada.  For Aboriginal women, self-government  must reflect the principles of integrity and  respect. Integrity from provincial and federal government authorities, and respect  for all future First Nation generations to  come". The only thing this video lacks is the  ability to provide an in-depth look at how  Writing Thru "Race" and the backlash  Changing the frame  Wendy Grant  each of the models of self government differ.  Tthow-Hegewelth/Lavina White, a Haida  Elder, says, "We as Native people always  believe in balance, and in our system that  wasn't male dominated or female dominated, there was balance, because if we expect balance with nature, then we must begin with ourselves, and that's what I think is  lacking in today's world".

This three day  conference of panels, workshops and reading events for First Nations writers and writers of colour emerged as a recommended  strategy from the conference The Appropriate Voice, sponsored by the Writers' Union of  Canada and held in Orillia, Ontario in 1992.  Writing Thru "Race" is part of an ongoing  process precipitated by challenges which  brought issue of racism to the Writers' Union's forum over the last 7 years. It has been  concieved and organized by a working committee of 15 Vancouver based writers including Roy Miki, Larissa Lai, Anne Jew, Corinne  Lee, Lydia Kwa, Monika Kin Gagnon, Susan  Crean, Angela Hyriniuk, Joy Hall, Scott  McFarlane, Peter Hudson, and Ajmer Rode.  The conference will include workshops  and panel discussions for First Nation writers and writers of colour as conference delegates. There will be literary events, including readings and discussions open to the  general public in the evenings. Topics to be  addressed during the conference include issues of racism, colonization, first vs. second  languages, family, cultural appropriation,  and sexuality.  In anticipation of the conference Monika  Kin Gagnon and Larissa Lai spoke with Lynne  Wanyeki about issues surrounding the conference, including the impetus for restricting  the conference to self-identified writers of  colour and First Nations writers, the dynamics of collective organizing toward singular  events such as this conference, and the mainstream backlash towards the conference which  occupied prominent pages of the Globe and  Mail and the Vancouver Sun for over a week in  April. The following are excerpts from a conversation held on April 21,1994.  Lynne Wanyeki: Could you describe your  interests in relation to the conference Writing  Thru "Race"?  Larissa Lai: I'm. here as a member of the  working committee for the conference. I'd  like to talk about the stategies of why we're  having the conference, and I guess I'm anxious to have the voices of the committee heard  as there's been so little of this happening to  date.  Monika Kin Gagnon: As someone who  has been writing about these issues as a critic  in the visual arts, I'm interested in the broader  cultural context and identifying patterns and  strategies for what we're doing as communities of colour and First Nations artists and  writers. There's no formula to what we're  doing, we're inventing it as it goes along and  I think its important that we compare and  discuss what we are doing. I'm less interested  in the mainstream backlash that's been happening around the conference than I am in  our own internal process and the differences  among us because of what the consequences are of what racism has done to all  of us, and what we have to do as individuals to come out of that and to provide  support for each other. There is a lot of  damage that we work through. How do  we maintain our focus?  Lai: We all come from such different  experiences of racism. One of the big things  I find I'm learning as we work on this  conference is listening skills. How to be  able to say to someone else "Okay, I hear  what you're saying, and I've changed my  mind about wherel'm coming from." And  learning to feel okay about that. It isn't  easy. It's something we've always had to  do with the mainstream, but not necessarily with other people of colour.  Wanyeki: Getting specifically to the  conference, can you elaborate on the decision to make this conference "closed" to  First Nations writers and Vv riters of colour  only? What was this process internally?  Lai: The official impetus for the conference came from the Writers Union of  Canada where there have been debates on  race and racism for the more than five  years. I'm not a member of the Writers  Union, but I attended Appropriate Voice  which was put together in 1992 for First  Nations writers and writers of colour by  the Racial Minority Writers Committee  within the Union. The committee included  Roy Miki, Lenore Keeshig-Tobias, Fred  Wah, Althea Trotman and Ajmer Rode.  The follow up and long term strategies for  this meeting were not really discussed in  great detail which was a shame, but it was  wonderful in the sense that many writers  who have been writing in isolation for a long  time had a chance to talk about their practices. What struck me, as someone who has  worked in film and video and the visual arts,  which tend to be more sociable disciplines, is  that the analysis in the writers of colour  community is less cohesive. This is not  necesarily bad, but it demonstrates perhaps  that there have not been many opportunities  for dialogue. Given the Eurocentric definitions of writing, people have been working  in isolation. And the term "racial minority."  What kind of context does that come from?  Wanyeki: Do you think this is a  generational issue with regard to politics?  Lai: Partly, but one of the main criteria  for being a member of the Writiers Union, as  an organization which provides writers with  access to one another, is that you have to  have a book under your belt, and I think that  a lot of people of colour who write extensively don't necesarily see the production of  books as a priority, especially those of us  who are politically conscious, who are much  more concerned with the dissemination of  information and communication than with  the production of books as commodities.  With regard to Writing Thru "Race", Roy  Miki was encouraged by other members of  the Writers Union to start up a conference in  Vancouver. He started calling meetings  among local writers in Vancouver last summer. I think the ["closed"] policy which has  really become the focus of the mainstream  Continued on p. 20  MAY 1994 continued from page 19  backlash, was always in the works. In the  committee meetings it was already apparent  who felt comfortable speaking and this really influenced the direction that the conference has taken. It's about simple empowerment and providing a context where First  Nations writers and writers of colour can at  least begin to determine our own agenda.  Even with the policy in place, issues of unequal access to power are not solved. We are  still working with coalitions of people with  very different politics and very different  levels of access to different kinds of power.  We have to remember that.  Gagnon: I worry about a dissipation of  our energies doing this interfacing work  with the mainstream or even so-called alternative cultural contexts.  I also wonder about similar events to  this writing conference in other disciplines,  like About Face, About Frame in 1992 within  the film and video community, or It's a  Cultural Thing which Minquon Panchayat  organized within the visual arts community  last fall. Should there be a national cross-  disciplinary coalition formed amongst First  Nations writers and artists, and writers and  and artists of colour? A coalition formed  around a cultural politic, maybe just temporarily, rather than being constrained and  divided by existing disciplines? We could  group around disciplines when we wanted  to, but otherwise, we could support each  other. [Or] at the very minimum, inform  each other of what we are doing and share  our strategies.  Lai: That's a fantastic idea, especially  when we think about how these divisions  are inherited from a European enlightenment division of practice, where thought is  divided up into history, philosophy, art, etc.  That's been extrapolated so that the practice  of representation is divided in writing, visual  art, theatre, film, video and so on.  Wanyeki: I like the notion of overlaying  all cultural practices with a mechanism that  speaks to structures of racism. With all these  separate units of colour working within  mainstream organizations, the onus is on us  to figure out what to do and then to come  back with solutions. [But] what we are really  working on is structural change across the  board. That's not just for people of colour to  figure out.  We began by talking about patterns.  Within the white mainstream, co-option occurs very rapidly, dominant structures adapt  themselves rather than change. A side effect  of this are the situations of backlash, where  all the work we do is absorbed into the  mainstream simply by our suddenly becoming accountable to the mainstream.  We have to develop structures that are  accountable, so racism is not seen as personal, and cannot be understood simply  being hurtful and offensive...  Lai: ...but about structural oppressions.  Wanyeki: A broader cultural critique  could amplify the structural dimensions of  racism.  Gagnon: What is so particular about racism is how angry people get. I get such  pleasure listening to the hysteria that is created in white contexts, like the media backlash, because it means that the work we do  affects a place that is very embedded in the  social consciousness. I love to see that stuff  shifting. Part of the challenge is to develop  skills to detach the structural and political  from the emotional dimensions of racism.  There's a social reflex to racism, which  is the backlash. It is dependent on an ideology of liberalism which arracializes and  evacuates power, and which allows an entire politic to be dismissed as emotional and  personal. It is the defensive reflex of power  and privilege protecting itself.  Lai: Which erases all histories, and particularly, the history of colonialism. It's a  funny word racism. It has a fundamental  assumption of symmetry, like somehow each  morning, we wake up, and the slate is clean,  with equal access to power. I understand  now why may writers are using the term  "whitesupremacy." It's so much moreclear.  Gagnon: Racism is a practice and white  supremacy imbeds relations of power in  these practices.  Wanyeki: And also places it within a  historical movement as well. [The word "racism"] carries a very limited and time-specific  repertoire of racist history: civil rights  marches, South Africa, the Holocaust. As  soon as the word "racism" is spoken, what is  evoked is these images which are simplistic.  It also allows for white people to identify  with suffering - it's not about suffering, it's  about structural power. But they want a sob  story...  Lai: They want a clear prescription for  what to do...  Wanyeki: But first you have to prove  how "hurt" you are, which ultimately leaves  power in their hands...  Gagnon: And if they empathize with  you then [it's as though] they've done something. As if it is somehow enough. I've been  thinking about how to activate white people  in an efficient and minimally emotional  Lai: Backlash is really a white issue. It  strikes me as useful to encourage white allies  is to start dismantling the racist framing of  the backlash as papers like the Globe and Mail  would like to frame it - "whiny people of  colour against the Canadian Nation." By  articulating an anti-racistpoliticwithoutbear-  ing the "burden of representation" which  people of colour and First Nations people  carry, they would be able to dismantle the  mainstream's dichotomization of the issues.  I think that is very useful.  Monika Kin Gagnon is a mixed-race Japanese/  French Canadian member of the Minquon  Panchayat.
