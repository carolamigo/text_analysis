AWARE women work in the field of addictions or they are recovering substance  abusers or they may be both. AWARE's  philosophy incorporates a recognition that  women develop substance abuse problems  for reasons that are different than men's.  The group implements this belief by making  recommendations about women's problem  prevention and treatment needs and ensuring that health promotion and educational  materials are accessible to women, particularly in hght of the fact that one in four  adults in Canada has less than a grade nine  education , and that more women than men  have low literacy skills.  AWARE is producing, for the province of  Ontario, a series of booklets on women's use  of legal, mood-altering drugs. The booklets  read at a grade eight level, and will be distributed in both Enghsh and French. They  target women particularly vulnerable to becoming dependant on prescription drugs:  low income women, women in middle years  and older, and women who are full-time  housewives. The social and pohtical environment which encourages women to turn  to prescription drugs to cope with the problems of day-to-day hving is discussed and  the safe use of tranquilizers, sleeping pills,  and anti-depressants is stressed.  AWARE beheves the booklets will enable women to make informed choices about  their use of legal drugs and ensure women  will be better able to discuss their use of  prescription drugs with their doctors and  other health care professionals. The booklets will be available in late 1989 or early  1990. For more information about ordering  booklets or about AWARE, please call (613)  545-0117 or write: AWARE, P.O.

Racism hurts all of us, but its effects  are experienced very differently by people  of colour and by white people. This workshop provides a positive, non-threatening  environment where women from all backgrounds can explore and begin to work  through a variety of issues related to race.  This June workshop is particularly geared  to women who have not attended a weekend  Unlearning Racism workshop before and  will be facilitated by members of AWARE,  a local alliance group.  Organizers want this workshop to be attended by 50 percent women of colour and  50 percent white women. Facilitators will  work separately with women of colour and  with white women for parts of the workshop. Women of colour will not have to hsten to the unaware racism of white women.  The workshop will be held at Camp Alexandra in White Rock, a wheelchair accessible site. Please let us know about other access needs. A childcare subsidy is available.  Sliding fee scale: $20 to $150. Register between May 1 and May 15 by calling: Celeste George, 251- 2635 or Mari Wright, 872-  4079.

Although abortion and sexual  orientation issues are expressly  forbidden in Secretary of State  (Secstate) funding criterion—re  suiting in the exclusion of many  projects—REAL's forthcoming  conference, "Equahty Revisited,"  gives free rein to anti-choice and  homophobic sentiments.  A preliminary conference agenda, obtained through Dawn  Black's (NDP-MP) office, includes  a speaker on the recent Joseph  Borowski Supreme Court appeal  decision, at which REAL intervened in Borowski's support.(Bor-  owsld's fetal rights challenge was  dismissed in March by the Supreme Court of Canada.)  Also, the workshop "Canadian  families: hi-lites, insights, future  trends," is expected to zero in  on the "homosexual threat"often  voiced by REAL.  Jan Barnsley of Vancouver's  Women's Research Centre, along  with other nationally-funded women's groups, met with Secstate  funders in early January.  Representatives from these groups attacked the ministry's pohcies on lesbianism and abortion,  hoping to lift the restrictions and  thereby (further) support women.  "The only way these pohcies  could be changed is if we man-  B.C.  age to convince the minister (Jerry  Weiner) to change them," she said.  But this isn't hkely to happen, she added. Rather, feminist  groups will continue to be warned  and threatened with funding loss  if work is done on these issues.  Yolanda McCay, a spokesperson  from Secstate, denies the arbitrary  use of these restrictions. "We do  not fund for abortion or particular sexual orientations or sexual  points of view," she said.  Furthermore, she "sees no reason" why their office should  be privy to REAL's conference  agenda.  Meanwhile, Dawn Black beheves the Secretary of State has  such information but refuses to  make it public.  Her office is now in the process  of applying under "Access to Information" regulations for a complete  conference agenda and a copy of  REAL's successful application.  After five years and five unsuccessful attempts at getting funding, REAL now has it's toe in the  door at Secstate.  "This represents the erosion of  the program's mandate and it's  very dangerous," says Barnsley.  "It was designed as a special program that women's groups fought  for and kept alive ...  "Its original framework was to  provide support to women's volunteer organizations designed to improve the status of women."  She's concerned that through  acquiring the skills to write successful funding applications—in  this case by re-defining 'equality'—  REAL or groups hke them will  also gain increased funding and attempt to undo the work of feminists.  The pro-family phenomenon is clearly an out-growth of the anti-abortion movement and 85 percent  of REAL women members also belong to "right to life" groups, according to a 1986 survey of anti-  feminist groups in anglophone Canada.  Efforts to stamp out this regressive trend have begun.  Intending to challenge the sexual orientation/abortion restriction and it's arbitrary enforcement, Gay Games (an international sports meet to be held in  Vancouver in 1990) is considering  applying to Secstate for project  funding.  If rejected, they'll make a  test-case of themselves and with  LEAF'S (Women's Legal Educar  tion and Action Fund) assistance,  fight the discriminatory and homophobic funding restriction.  See Fuming pg. i  Advancing  women  by Sylvia Back  Ministry make-work project?  by Esther Shannon  It used to be men would ask,  "What do women want?" and feminists would grit their teeth. An  update on the question in B.C. is,  "What does the new women's ministry want?" and apparently, no  one knows.  The Social Credit government  announced the establishment of a  women's ministry in the March  Speech from the Throne, which  opened the new legislative session.  Details, such as who the new minister will be, have not been forthcoming.  What has been announced is  that the new ministry will "ensure women's access to decisionmaking, assess government programs in assisting workers with  family responsibilities, review access to skills and training programs and guide the province in  developing day-care pohcies."  Currently, the government department responsible for these issues, with the exception of daycare, is the Women's Secretariat,  a branch of the Ministry of Advanced Education and Job Training.  Michelle Poirier, Director of  Pubhc Affairs for  the ministry,  told Kinesis the Women's Secretariat "doesn't know the timing of  the ministry, who is going to be  the minister, what kind of scope  the ministry will have or any other  details."  According to Poirier, "It would  make sense that the Women's Secretariat would become a part of  the ministry and it would appear  that is very hkely to happen but  we really don't know." Poirier also  said that the Women's Secretariat  was not consulted prior to the  announcement. "We didn't know  that it would be announced."  New Democrat Party Women's  Critic, Darlene Marzari has called  the new ministry "... a contradiction in terms. The Socreds  continue to put women in this  province down. A women's ministry should empower and encourage women. It should open doors  for women and this government  has never done that for women."  Marzari charged that, "This  ministry won't be efficient because  it doesn't have a framework or a  base. It only exists because the So-  cred's have been reacting to poll  results that say that the government doesn't have the support of  women. It's a grab for the women's  vote and  possibly  a  payoff for  Carol Gran's loyalty to BiU Vander  Zalm." (Gran is the Social Credit  caucus chairperson. She has recently been increasingly supportive of Vander Zalm after opposing  his stand on abortion.)  In a recent speech in the legislature about the women's ministry, Marzari pointed to a number  of actions the government could  take to demonstrate its support for  B.C. women. Included in her hst  were: immediate funding for Everywoman's Health Centre, complete education for women and  girls around family planning and  reproductive choice, an affirmative  action plan, a pay equity bill, affordable housing, transition and  second stage housing for battered  women, an increase to poverty levels, at least, in welfare rates and a  move to massively increase childcare spaces, to mention just a few  of Marzari's proposals.  Since Bill Vander Zalm's government appears to be at somewhat of a loss with respect to  the new women's ministry's activities, this hst seems tailor made to  fill the gap in the Socred's planning, at least for the short term.  No doubt other suggestions will  be forthcoming from women in the  province.  The Vancouver School Board  has adopted pohcy which calls on  the Board to "endeavour to establish and maintain an equal number  of men and women in all administrative positions, including school  and district positions."  The pohcy is a move to increase the percentage of women  who are secondary school principals and senior administrative personnel, such as District Supervisors, in the Vancouver School District.  According to trustee Dr. Pauline Weinstein, "Since 1982, the  board has Mowed the practice  that if there were two equally qualified candidates for a position, and  one was a woman, than we would  hire the woman and so putting this  in pohcy, while not a new step, is  a very important committment by  the board."  In the Vancouver School District, only one of the seven senior administrators is a woman  and only eight of the forty high  school principals are women. Of  the 1,238 secondary school teachers employed by the board, 522  are women. Secondary school administrative positions are generally filled by teachers coming up  through the ranks of high school  teaching.  Weinstein says that the Board's  record in some areas would have  been much improved if not for the  "... restraint program which has  meant very httle hiring and the  loss of some administrative positions in the past four years."  "It is, however, a fact of hfe,"  Weinstein said, "that few women  in the system aspire to administrative positions because the workload is such that they could be out  three and four nights a week at  meetings and often there are weekend conferences to attend. This  becomes a real conflict for women  who may have young children at  home. Society doesn't go out of its  way to help women in this situation.  "The system must take these aspects into account and try to facilitate a better approach. It may  need to look at issues such as day  care and evening care for children,  for a start."  The new school board pohcy  is not without its detractors. Dr.  Ken Denike, former chairperson of  the board, voted against the motion saying that it "would not be in  the best interests of staff morale."  Denike argues that because  there is a higher proportion of  male teachers at the secondary  school level it is natural that there  will be more male administrators  because the board "doesn't have  the same base, the same pool of  talent to work from."  "There are many people," said  Denike, "looking up to the next  level of promotion and if anything other than talent (as a basis  for promotion) was imposed there  would be problems."  The Secondary Teachers' Association is supportive of the board  efforts and intends to recommend  that a representational committee be established to discover  ways to improve the representation of women in administrative  positions.  Association President Don Bri-  ard does not think that staff  morale would be adversely affected. "The majority of teachers  would recognize and would accept  the fact that something needs to  be done to address the problem,"  said Briard.  KINESIS ACROSS B.C.  Nurses seek contract, condemn cutbacks  by Nancy Pollak  After years of poor wages and  poorer working conditions, nurses  in British Columbia are prepared  to make the Spring of '89 the sear  son they deliver a strong dose of  labour militancy to their employ-  In fact, this season may prove  a time of general labour tension  throughout provincial hospitals as  all the major health care unions  ;negotiate contracts which ended  March 31 (see Box).  The strategy of the 20,000-  strong B.C. Nurses Union (BCNU)  is being watched with particular interest, in part because of  the stirring performance of sister  unions on the Prairies in contract  negotiations in 1988.  Both the United Nurses of Alberta and the Saskatchewan Union  of Nurses waged successful strikes  in the face of vicious attacks  by their provincial governments,  whose austerity programs had created substandard hospital conditions similar to those facing B.C.  nurses—and patients.  Debra McPherson, a nurse at  Vancouver General Hospital's cardiac surgery ward and BCNU regional representative, cites two  major issues: overtime and work  load.  Our present contract requires  only a 'reasonable amount' of overtime which management can request [rather than demand]," says  McPherson, a 17-year nursing veteran. "But nurses are doing lots  of overtime ... and having heavy  moral and guilt pressures laid on  them to do it."  The demand for overtime stems  from a simple enough source: a  critical shortage of nurses. In 1988,  a B.C. Ministry of Health study  concluded the province needed  2,000 more nurses. Other studies  show that each month, an average  of 460 nursing posts go unfilled.  Not surprisingly, these shortages directly affect both the working nurse and her patients. Nationally, this province ranks next-  to-last for the amount of nursing  care received by hospital patients,  according to Statistics Canada.  And the attention B.C. patients  do receive frequently comes from  a nurse who is working short-  staffed—or alone, in a situation  she considers unsafe.  For example, the intensive care  unit at Vancouver's Childrens'  Hospital is 14 nurses short. "Women are working a job and a  half," says McPherson. "As you  can imagine, this affects how good  you feel about your work ...  nurses are burning-out, morale is  low."  BCNU president Pat Savage has  characterized the understaffing as  part of a "vicious circle. Substandard conditions make it hard to recruit badly-needed nurses ... and  we go from bad to worse because  there are ^»o few of us.  "The system is eroding under  our feet while the provincial government and our employers do virtually nothing."  The BCNU is negotiating with  the hospitals' management body,  the Health Labour Relations Association (HLRA). Seventeen thousand nurses in 142 hospitals are affected by the talks which, at press  time, are scheduled to continue at  least until mid-April.  Wages are another irritant to  working nurses—and to the nursing shortage. Ranking about average nationally, B.C. general  duty registered nurses start at  $15.07/hr and peak at $17.43/hr.  Since the nursing shortage is  continent-wide, B.C. recruiters  cannot attract nurses due to the  relatively low wages and stressful  working conditions.  Contract proposals tabled by  HLRA in early March called for no  wage increase. The entire HLRA  package amounts to a series of rollbacks: in benefits, control of work  scheduhng, ease of transfers, etc.  Says McPherson, "Astonishing  and insulting ... HLRA is truly  pushing it."  The nursing shortage has deeper  roots as well, ones that strike at  the heart of a health care system laden with patriarchal values. "H we look at who became  a nurse," says McPherson, "it  was traditionally women—older  daughters—instilled with the duty  to care." Nursing tradition also instilled the duty of absolute obedience to the (usually male) doctor.  "Now, women are more sophisticated," says McPherson. "We  want respect, autonomy, input  into decisions ... The structure of  the health care system doesn't allow that." In fact, the system is  Who's Who  On March 31st, contracts for all the major health care unions expired.  Who's who at the bargaining table?  ♦ BCNUt The British Columbia Nurses Union has 17,000 of its 20,000  members up for a new contract. The BCNU are Registered Nurses—  with either a 2-year nursing diploma (90 percent of the membership),  a 4-year nursing degree or advanced training.  ♦ MWOt The Hospital Employees Union is 23,000 strong—85 percent  of whom are women. Their jobs range from laundry and food service work to orderlies, respiratory technologists and Licenced Practical Nurses (LPN). The HEU is owed $5 minion in wages from its last  contract; this year, HEU is seeking pay equity.  ♦ HSA: The 7,000-member Health Sciences Association is 87 percent  women, HSA represents 50 professions including dieticians, physiotherapists and lab technologists. HSA is also seeking pay equity, since  their members earn up to 24 percent less than male-dominated public  sector professionals.  ♦ PARI: The Professional Association of Residents and Interns is the  union for doctors employed by hospitals.  remarkably disrespectful of nurses'  skill and intelligence and, as a consequence, "people leave the profession, and they leave it early."  The BCNU is negotiating for  the inclusion of a Professional  Responsibility clause which will  give nurses some power over their  working conditions. With such a  clause, nurses who are concerned  with staff shortages, for example,  will have a mechanism by which  to appeal management decisions.  (An independent body of nursing  experts would evaluate the disputed situation according to accepted nursing practice.)  Nurses in Ontario and Saskatchewan won professional responsibility clauses in their last contracts.  Although the HLRA faces nurses at the bargaining table, "It  is the government which pulls the  strings that move the hand that  eventually signs the contract,"  said union head Savage at a winter Wage and Pohcy conference.  Nurses have every reason to be  wary of Socred health care policy which seems more focused on  funding medical technology than  health practitioners.  Hospital nurses in B.C. have  never   been   on   strike   and,   as  McPherson says, "We would approach that with trepidation ...  and there's the moral dilemma (of  caring for their patients.)" The  BCNU has hammered out essential services plans in the event of a  strike.  While nurses are hoping their  bargaining committee can achieve  a good contract through negotiations, "We won't accept another  garbage contract," says McPherson.  "We're tired of being jerked  around. We've accepted public sector cutbacks, but no more. We're  tired of being nice."  Organizing for pay equity  by Marion Pollack  "Just give us the money." This  was the theme and an oft repeated  refrain at the March B.C. Federation of Labour Conference on pay  equity.  Delegates at the conference  made it clear that they were tired  of receiving lousy wages for performing valuable work. Provincial  government workers, clerks, hospital technicians, were all unanimous  in the feehng that they wanted pay  equity. Now.  The Conference had two focuses. One was to assess how far  women have come in the fight for  pay equity and to give participants  the tools to carry on those fights in  their unions. The second focus was  on developing a pay equity coalition to give support and coherence  to the struggle. The conference organizers are convinced that a coalition is the main way to ensure that  the fight for pay equity keeps a  high profile.  Rosemary Warskett, an independent researcher, was one of  the keynote speakers. She outlined  how big business and governments  benefit from keeping wages for  women and minorities low. Warskett said, that this low wage strategy was a deliberate pohcy pointing out that pay equity is more  important than ever as government's and businesses are transferring jobs to the poorly paid  non-union service sector. Warskett  also tied together the fights for  an increase in the minimum wage  and pay equity saying both are  necessary to ensure that working  women and minorities get what is  due to them. She concluded by  saying that a coalition is needed to  fight effectively for pay equity.  Warskett was followed by a  panel of women unionists discussing the progress of their  unions in achieving pay equity.  Bernice Kirk from the Canadian  Union of Pubhc Employees talked  about how Nelson civic employees  have won pay equity in their latest round of negotiations. Sherry  Parker from the Pubhc Service Alliance of Canada recounted how  her union is involved in a fairly  complex job evaluation scheme  with the federal government in an  attempt to achieve pay equity. She  said that her Union-Management  Committee had been meeting for  over five months and has evaluated  less than one third of the jobs in  their jurisdiction.  Throughout the conference considerable time was spent on discussing how to mobilize to achieve  pay equity. Participants heard how  women civic workers in Nelson described their jobs to their male  co-workers and then pointed out  the lousy pay rates. Many of the  men were appalled and subsequently became pay equity supporters. Another story told how  workers at one American University developed a programme, "Into  the Red," to accompany their bargaining for pay equity. The campaign started slowly with some  women wearing one item of red  clothing to work. By the time bargaining was in full swing all the  women were fully clothed in red,  and all the men were sporting red  shirts.  One of the most important ways  to achieve pay equity is through  the establishment of a coalition. A  portion of the conference was devoted to that. Jean Swanson from  End Legislated Poverty talked  about the do's and dont's in forming a coalition. She made it clear  that coalition was not only possible, it was necessary.  Anne Harvey, the ex-chair of  the B.C. Federation of Labour  Women's Committee, gave a courageous speech saying that the  trade union movement had made  mistakes in the 1983 Solidarity  Coalition and that it had to learn  from them if it is going to build  a real coalition. Nothing else, she  said, will do.  Delegates left the conference  pledging to do one thing on the  issue of pay equity. Some women  are going to write letters. Some  women are going to read more on  the issue. Other women are going  to talk to their co-workers. One by  one we are going to build a massive movement for pay equity.  4 KINESIS Across B.C.  ////////////////y.  DAWN B.C. focuses on family life  by Eunice Brooks  Women with disabilities met at the Lion's  Easter Seal Camp Squamish, March 16-19th  to bring to a close the DisAbled Women's  Network's (DAWN) year of focus on Violence Against Disabled Women, and to begin the year of Family Life.  Each year the DAWN women select a focus, while still gathering information on previous interests. The purpose of the Network  is information gathering and education.  DAWN B.C. is not a self-help group, nor  a doctor, nor a social club. The Network  serves for information passing. Members are  dedicated to educating themselves and others about services available, ways of improving well-being, and how to end the solitude  disabihty brings with it.  The time of arrivals is almost too exciting to bear, as children and mothers greet  friends they have hkely not seen for a year.  Bonding of newcomers takes place as if by  magic. There never seem to be loners at a  DAWN B.C. conference. The sororal atmosphere is abetted by plenty of food, fires in  the fireplaces, the music of laughter, and  hugging. Tears of joy are not rare.  For a woman such as Lynn WUgenhof,  with disabilities that cause her to need  a wheelchair, getting to a conference at  Squamish might mean leaving her Prince  George home at five minutes past breakfast. She lugs with her a child, Kristen, and  bags of necessary clothing, swim suits and  towels. The first journey is to the airport.  She wings it to Vancouver. Next she pushes  through the crowds to find the ride that will  carry her and Kristen up the highway of  falling rocks (which our government has renamed but not refamed). She is tired, and  the network supports her as she falls into  the rhythm of the weekend workshops and  the annual general meeting. She is DAWN.  Travel to camp was facilitated by a pair  of vans with tie-downs for women who use  wheelchairs for mobility, also by a luxury  highway bus, with toilet, air conditioning,  lights over each seat, and the nicest driver  ever to tromp on the gas. He was, one could  say, the opening act for the performance of  the weekend. This year, the swimming pool  was available for those arriving after lunch  Thursday.  Also this year there was a full agenda  of children's activities, not just babysitting. Women from Women Against Violence  Against Women (WAVAW) assisted the  children in peer counselling and role playing. A profoundly deaf child, Ann Marie,  bonded with Sarah, who has hearing. They  were almost inseparable. Several of the children entertained the luncheon crowd on Saturday with a play. Each received a Network  award presented by Hilda Dahl.  The camp is situated in a valley, near a  river, and includes accessible hiking trails.  It was an introduction to a way of hfe for  some. On Sunday morning shortly before  the bus was ready to haul the group back to  Vancouver, there was an interesting revolt  by the children.  They had discovered an old shack in the  forest, and this new generation—a genera-  New Board  The DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN B.C.) has elected a board to serve until the  next AGM. Lower Mainland members consist of: Janice Stevenson of Surrey; Debra West-  drop of Langley; Jackie Pope of WMte Rock; Eunice Brooks of Surrey; Gem Wirszilas of  Surrey; Isabel Alexander of Vancouver; Lynn Wheeler of Surrey; Jenny Volk of Port Coquitlam; Denise Kane of Burnaby; Andrea Fraser of Vancouver; and Stephanl Crow of  Burnaby.  The interior board members have not as yet been fully polled about nomination acceptances, but Lynn Wilgenhof of Prince George got in by acclamation. Isabel Sperberg of  Nanaimo is the Vancouver Island co-ordinator, and Cindy Cole of Vernon is the one to see  in the Okanagan.  The positions on the executive will be chosen by secret ballot at the first board meeting.  At that time DAWN B.C.'s committees for the upcoming year will also form. The group  is seeking a new place to meet.  For further information on DAWN B.C. call 589-4088, 584-1358 or 584-4449  (Vancouver).  Access  stalled  by Kinesis Staff Writer  As the end of the International Decade  for the Disabled draws near, Canadians  with disabilities are still fighting for access  to their communities," according to a report by the B.C. Coalition of the Disabled  (BCCD).  The report, entitled "Pathways to Integration," traces the history of disabled people's organizing around access issues and  examines three areas: design requirements,  enforcement of barrier-free design and disabled peoples' experiences of whether accessibility had improved in their communities.  Elena Thibeau, of BCCD's Plan A for  Access, said "It is clear that the professionals and the municipalities are giving us  band-aid solutions which are not solving the  problem. In B.C., we have the best building  code in Canada but we want more enforcement to ensure that new building codes are  fully accessible from the start."  Over 200 surveys were sent to disabled  consumer groups across Canada to look at  the state of accessibihty in their commu  nity. Almost half the people surveyed said  their community was not accessible for people with a disabihty and even more said that  access was not adequately covered in the  building code requirements in their area.  According to the survey, most disabled  consumers feel that the best goal for accessibihty is the integration of people in society and the best way to enforce that goal  is through the development and strict enforcement of accessibihty standards in municipal building codes. The report also calls  for increasing education of all professionals  involved in the various stages of design and  regulation of construction.  BCCD points out, "The number of people with disabilities is increasing in our society. As Canadians grow older the demand  for accessibihty features will increase. The  goal of accessibihty legislation is the integration of people into society, rather than  special concessions for people with disabilities."  Copies of the "Pathways to Integration" report are available from BCCD,  211 - 456 West Broadway, Vancouver,  B.C.

In each workshop,  those attending spoke of what they know  best. Every woman has a story worth telling  and hearing. The group has plans to publish  some of the stories told in this Family Life  Conference. An anthology is in the works.  In parenting, we learned how the government makes announcements that "the  family" is important, but a bhnd mother  of four sons cannot get homemaker service.  Her worker explains the children should be  doing the laundry and floors. Nor is there  money for recreational outings for families when mom is on a pension. There is  no respite care for the worn out disabled  mom who has no blood relations or available  friends to call upon, and httle money for a  baby sitter. The Ministry of Social Services  . and Housing appears to have as its primary  mandate the protection of tax dollars from  the needs of disabled mothers.  An opening panel included workers from  both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Services and Housing. No rotten tomatoes were thrown at them, but the  mood of the queries was angry, and the facilitator had to cut the panel short. They—  the panel—refused an invitation to stay for  lunch.  In reproductive rights the twin topics of  abortion and the right to carry what has  been labelled a "defective" fetus were discussed. Women shared stories of abortions  they had, and ones they almost had. The  most striking story belonged to a woman  whose son we had all met, and hked. He's  nor an easy time forgetting, but neither did  anyone admit to regretting abortions had.  Through long raking sobs, one woman  talked of the isolation of not having an ability to read. It was from her frustration that  a pohcy was formed, to focus the DAWN  B.C. eye on illiteracy and communications  for our 1990 projects. Our work is always for  the needs of members. Each joiner brings  a story, stories lead to projects. Everyone  contributes. Everyone benefits. DAWN B.C.  works on the individual person and her  quality of hfe and well-being.  We'll research ways for this illiterate sister to learn things readers take for granted.  Talking books was the first suggestion. Others flowed along with the empathy.  We learned in a workshop, designed to  inform members on the ways free trade  is being implemented, that demands from  Americans are already causing social programs to be cut. One example cited is the  new program Worker's Compensation was  preparing to inform people of the hazards  of working with dangerous chemicals. Evidently this program goes against the best  interests of some American chemical companies. Women farm workers will suffer.  There was counselling available all weekend with two members of WAVAW, and a  lay counsellor from White Rock Women's  Place.

Wen-  do provides strong women role models and  a safe space where women can talk about  fears and experiences related to sexual violence." Counsel for Wen-do beheves that  the women-only program addresses the disadvantage experienced by women as targets  of violence and is thus protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code. Source: LEAF  Gonorrhea  alert  The number of cases of gonorrhea strains  that are resistant to conventional antibiotics  increased by about 35 percent last year.  Most of this increase occurred in cities in  Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Doctors in  North York, Toronto, for example, are now  finding that more than one out of every two  cases of gonorrhea are proving resistant to  penicillin.  A sexuaUy transmitted disease, gonorrhea infects the urethra and genital tract.  It is caused by the neisseria gonorrheal bacteria that can infect the lining of the urethra, cervix, rectum, throat or eyes, and  untreated can spread throughout the body,  producing fatal infections such as meningitis. In women who contract the disease  it may be several weeks or months before symptoms are apparent, and it can result in sterility. Gonorrhea was tradition-  aUy treated with peniciUin or the antibiotic tetracycline, however, the peniciUin resistant neisseria gonorrhoea (PPNG) do not  respond to conventional antibiotics.  PPNG strains were first reported in 1976  in U.S. soldiers who had served in Vietnam,  and the present rise in the number of cases  in Canada is attributed to sexual contacts  with infected people from the United States  and the Caribbean, where resistant strains  of gonorrhea are endemic.  Experts at the laboratory are conducting  a national study of the incidence of PPNG  and are encouraging provincial health agencies to monitor and control its occurrence  more closely.

According to Raj Anand of the  HRC, "with respect to women, the figures are clearly discouraging and indicate  that voluntary employment equity measures have largely been unsuccessful." Recently released statistics show that women  in Ontario stiU tend to be clustered in  lower academic and non-academic ranks  at post-secondary institutions. Raj Anand  says that it is especiaUy disconcerting that  such inequities prevaU after three years of  employment-equity support from the Ontario Women's Directorate.

The poU, which deals  with the country's deficit and how to reduce  it, shows that whUe most people want the  Tories to reduce the deficit, they also question the government's ability to do so effectively and fairly.  Forty-seven percent of people poUed expect that the pubUc would not be treated  equitably if the government decides to take  major steps to reduce the deficit; 36 percent say the Tories would act fairly; 17 percent are unsure. In other results, 56 percent  of people surveyed support cuts in defense  spending, whUe 38 percent are opposed, and  nearly 80 percent favour raising taxes on  large corporations, whUe 14 percent are opposed to this.

In handing down the ruhng, Chief  Justice Tevie MiUer held that chUd stabU-  ity is more important than parental bonding. Therefore, primary custody of the chUdren has been transferred to the father, who  hves in Edmonton.  Their mother was given a choice: if she  stayed in Edmonton her chUdren could remain with her, but if she moved, then she  would only have access to the chUdren dur  ing spring and summer school breaks, as  weU as at least two four-day weekends a  year.  FamUy law practitioners in Alberta are  closely watching the effects of the new ruling, believing that it may have a chUling  effect on the mobility plans of estranged  spouses with joint custody arrangements.  Mothers are caught more often in this  dUemma than fathers because their home  is stiU the primary residence of chUdren in  many joint custody arrangements.  Lawyer Louise Ares, who represented  the Edmonton woman in this landmark  case says that lawyers wUl have to rethink  their approach to the custody issue, "if the  courts keep on holding the custodial parent  hostage to a particular location to accommodate the other parent's visiting rights."

Sexual harassment in the workplace is  cited as a form of stress which affects more  women than men—a survey found 15 percent of women and 4 percent of men received sexual harassment.

FoUowing the release of the report  CACSW has called for changes to diminish  stress in women's hves.

Literacy training was dropped last year  from these programs because it showed a  lower rate of success then other skiUs training. However, without literacy instruction  in employment training, illiterate people are  condemned to a narrow range of programs  in which they may be taught new job skUls,  and as a result of this, they are trapped at  the lower end of the wage scale. The NAPO  brief, which deals specificaUy with the barriers to employment and training, also states  that lack of chUdcare centres severely limits  those seeking job training. Source: Globe  and Mail  Hepatitis  screening  The National Advisory Committee on  Immunization (NACI) has recommended  that aU pregnant women be routinely tested  for hepatitis B. Since most carriers of hepatitis B don't know they have it, routine  testing of pregnant women would expose  carriers, and enable immunization of their  chUdren to begin within 24 hours of birth,  thus reducing the number of new carriers of  the disease. Hepatitis B infects the liver and  can cause cirrhosis and cancer of the liver.  It is transmitted through sexual contact and  the exchange of contaminated blood, including chUdbirth and intravenous drug use.  According to Dr. Anne Carter, chief of  communicable disease at the Laboratory  Centre for Disease Control, "the unfortunate thing is that a chUd is usuaUy infected during the birth process, and the  younger you are when you get hepatitis B  the more hkely you are to become a carrier."  There is a strong correlation between hepatitis B and AIDS—more than 90 percent  of people with AIDS also carry hepatitis B.  Screening of pregnant women for hepatitis  B is widespread in Alberta and Manitoba  and NACI beheves it could easily be implemented in most provinces.

According to Cathy Coffin,  vice-president of the Canadian  Abortion Rights Action League  (CARAL), her organization is  also "contemplating legal action  against the Nova Scotia government's new restriction on access to  abortion."  In mid-March, Nova Scotia's  ruhng Progressive Conservative  government announced that abortion in the province can only  be performed in provinciaUy approved hospitals. The government  also said that provincial medical  insurance wUl not pay for abortions done outside Nova Scotia  hospitals. The penalty for violating these new regulations in the  Hospitals Act and the Health Act  is a maximum of $500.  According to Coffin, the government move is aimed directly at  preventing Dr. Henry Morgentaler  from opening a clinic in Nova Scotia.  "The government beheves that  Henry Morgentaler brings chaos  and disruption everywhere he  goes. They established this pohcy  simply to keep Henry Morgentaler  out of here."  Despite the new regulations  Morgentaler, whose successful  1988 Supreme Court appeal led  to the abolition of Canada's abortion laws, has vowed to open a  free standing chnic, the sixth in  Canada, in Hahfax.  Fuming from pg. 3   "We're in the early stages of  just talking about it with LEAF  and between ourselves," said organizer Betty Baxter, "But it's an  option we're definitely considering."  Another channel of attack, also  in it's early stages, is exposing  REAL propaganda—particularly  that which is directed against gays  and lesbians—as 'hate literature',  and as such contravening Canadian law.  Andre Buchanan of The Gazebo  Connection (a Vancouver-based  lesbian group) says through funding REAL the Canadian government tacitly accepts the groups'  invective and is therefore also  spreading hate.  "Rather than leaving the door  open for REAL to obtain funding  in the future under the women's  program or any other federal program," said Buchanan in a 1987  parliamentary brief, "... We contend the government of Canada  has a responsibility to demand  that REAL cease it's distribution  of hate propaganda against lesbians and gay men."  On other fronts, stemming from  January's consultation in Toronto  with Secstate, women's groups are  "These regulations have no justification and their sole motivation  is to prevent me and my coUeagues  from opening a free-standing clinic  in Hahfax," Morgentaler told reporters four days after the Nova  Scotia pohcy was announced. Morgentaler says his clinic, whUe based  in Hahfax, wUl serve women from  aU over Atlantic Canada.  Coffin said that pro-choice women in Hahfax wUl be supporting Morgentaler's effort to open  a clinic. "But, our first priority would be to develop a freestanding clinic which provided  medicaUy insured abortions in  feminist clinics. That option may  be further down the hne, but obviously that would be our ideal."  Coffin noted the provincial government is wrong when it says  Nova Scotia women already have  access to abortion and so freestanding chnics are not necessary.  "There are supposedly 12 hospitals in the province which do abortions, but in fact one, Halifax's  Victoria General, did 83 percent of  the 1400 abortions performed here  in 1986. And the Victoria General has a quota - seven abortions,  five days a week - and it wUl not  perform abortions for women from  out of province.  "Morgentaler estimates that  over 500 women come to his (Montreal) clinic from the Atlantic  provinces, and we know, from our  abortion referral service, that at  least a further 200 travel to the  United States.  "So access, particularly for rural  women, is a major problem here.  But, another really big problem is  that doctors wUl not refer women  organizing a feminist lobby to  stem the right-wing funding swing  and to ensure the survival of progressive women's organizations.  An initial item on their agenda  was a mid-March meeting with  Barbara McDougall, Minister Responsible for the Status of Women.  (Jerry Weiner, Secretary of State,  refused to attend this meeting.)  "McDougaU's response to our  criticism on REAL funding was  more or less—"Give me a break!"  said PhU Masters of Resources for  Feminist Research in Toronto.  "She figured the funding was so  httle and she didn't want to talk  about it or look at it's broader implications."  A second consultation is underway for June, with the hope  that more ministers and women's  groups wUl attend. "And we don't  want just Secstate-funded groups,  but the women's movement more  generaUy," said Masters.  Meanwlule, postcards bearing  the NAC logo are being shot off  to Ottawa from aU corners of the  country, condemning Secstate for  it's erosion of the program, and an  April meeting between NAC and  Secstate is planned at which the  issue of REAL funding wUl be addressed.  for abortions. A lot of women go  to a doctor to talk about abortion and are just told to,'Get out.'  We have been coUecting this information and it is one horror story  after another. We have pressured  the Nova Scotia Medical Society  to try and work with physicians  and ensure that they wUl offer  the full range of pregnancy counselling, not just teU women to get  out. H they don't want to do abortions that's fine, but they are obligated to teU women what is avaUable.  "But the Medical Society wUl  not speak out on abortion even  though they have adopted the  Canadian Medical Association's  position (that a decision on abortion should be a matter between  a woman and her doctor). WhUe  CARAL has a wonderful hst of  pro- choice doctors who wUl do re  ferrals very few wiU speak out in  support of abortion. At some hospitals here, in order for a doctor to  get operating privUeges, they have  to make a commitment not to do  abortions, or even speak out on the  issue."  According to Coffin the provincial government's ban on freestanding clinics is catering to a  smaU minority of anti- abortion fanatics. "During the last election,"  she said, "you could drive around  and see 8 and 10 foot signs that  said 'The Unborn: Let them Live'  and you'U see maybe 1,000 people at the Roman Cathohc BasU-  ica where they have masses for the  unborn.  "But the GaUop poU we did in  October of 1988 showed that sixty-  five percent of people in Nova Scotia supported women, in consultation with her doctor, having the  right to choose. That is unqualified support for a woman's right to  choose and that support has gone  up. Opinion on the right to choose  used to be pretty close to 50/50  here."

Before the decision to cease publication, Broadside intended to apply  to the Secretary of State for enough money to publish the anniversary  issue and tide them over.  "Secstate said it sounded hke a reaUy good project, and that we should  request $10,000 instead of the $5,000 we first considered applying for,"  said editor PhU Masters.  "But before we even got the chance to apply, Secstate caUed to teU us  not to bother, that we didn't have a chance."  The rejection came just days before REAL received their $21,000. (See  story page 3)  "There was an ironic twist to it aU," said Masters. "In rejecting us Secstate asked, 'Who do you represent?' MeanwhUe, there they are funding  REAL!"  Broadside beheves the rejection was in large part due to their lesbian  and pro-choice content.  "We're considered to be a lesbian publication amply because we don't  mind using the word 'lesbian.' Also, our position on abortion is clear."  Broadside stiU intends to do the anniversary issue, but without  the Secstate cheque a publication date is indefinite. They're presently  fundraising and hope to publish in June, but may have to wait until October.  Concerning their decision to fold, Masters says it isn't just financial  restraints but also a question of personal energy and commitment.  'We've been doing it a long time, never with very much money, and  we're tired of the juggling act. We've gone through slump periods before,  but people just don't want to do it anymore."

Adding to the controversy  about the case was Inwood's defense against the charges which depended largely on Ins contention  that Sidorova only married him  so she could become a Canadian  citizen. During the trial such tactics made Sidorova's credibility as  much of tin issue as Inwood's assault on his wife and Misha.  At his trial, Inwood was found  guUty of assault causing bodUy  harm on Sidorova and common assault on Misha. He received a three  month suspended sentence for the  assault on Sidorova, served one  month in jaU for the assault on  his son, and was placed on three  years probation. The Crown appealed both sentences arguing that  they were too lenient.  The Ontario Court of Appeal  decision upheld the original sentences and also concluded that the  incidents by themselves did not  make Inwood a wife beater.  Speaking for the court, Chief  Justice William Howland said a  predominant characteristic in battered wife cases "is the persistent  or repetitive and escalating nature  of the violence.  "In my opinion, the case before  this court is not a 'battered wife'  case in that sense. It might have  developed into one if the relationship between Inwood and Sidorova  had not terminated."  In comments on the Ontario decision, Vancouver transition house  worker, Jan Ford told Kinesis  that the court's decision is  aUy very ironic. Often we hear of  women staying in a battering situation for a long time and people  ask 'How come you didn't leave?'  And reaUy they can't beheve her  situation was that serious or else  she would have left. Here we have  a situation where the woman got  out right away and the court says  it means she reaUy wasn't a battered woman.  "A decision hke this," said Ford,  "points to tacit approval for this  kind of violence. It's very demoralizing and discouraging for women  who have to deal with the courts  because the situation seems to be  getting worse and worse. Judges  seem to be 10 or 15 years behind  the times. People are not getting a  message from the courts that violence against women is wrong and  wUl be dealt with."  KINESIS I. W. D.

In her speech, the IMA representative sent out her greetings and solidarity on behalf of her organization to "all the brave women and oppressed  peoples of the world struggling to build a better tomorrow, struggling for  self dignity, economic independence and self determination."  Alluding to racist discrimination directed towards the South Asian community, Jyoti Sanghera said that every man and woman that came to  Canada did so for precisely the same reasons that the South Asians have  come here for.  "Then why are we being shunned, denounced and hated as pariahs by  those who happened to come here earlier, who also happened to be of a  colour, creed and religion different from those women and men who orig  inally lived here? We do not come here to destroy and impose—to colonize," she said. "We were lured here as this country needed cheap labour."  She further added that pillage and domination of their countries'  economies by colonial and now imperialist powers have created a situation of extreme poverty and unemployment in those societies. Therefore, women and men immigrate to different parts of the world as workers,  searching for better life prospects. "Unfortunately, in the west, our people  are ridiculed on account of their colour, and scapegoated," she added.  Sanghera cautioned the women's movement in Canada to not merely  pay lip service to the concerns of these immigrant and visible minority  women, but to reach out and incorporate these concerns in their agenda;  "Only this effort on the part of all of us will give the women's movement  strength, energy and dynamism."  Addressing the issue of pro-choice and abortion, Sanghera reiterated  her organization's support for the Everywoman's Health Centre. It was demanded that the federal government not pass any more laws on abortion,  and that the provincial government extend full nancial assistance to the  Health Centre.

South Asian women rise  by Jyoti Sanghera  Each year on the 8th of March, women  in every part of the world celebrate a historic day; the International Women's Day.  A rapidly growing awareness of women's  rights, a proliferation of women's groups,  and a mass level mobilization of women in  every continent of the globe today makes  the women's movement an entrenched and  unshakable reality. No nation can ignore  any longer, the rumbhngs of discontent and  struggle that its women are stirring up.  No state or regime can repress with impunity any longer, the demands raised by  its women citizens for social justice, equality in wages, access to education, health services and to legal recourse.  These have been achievements of a long  and glorious struggle of women, globally.  And these gains have not merely been  handed to the women out of magnanimity  or a sense of fair play. Women activists in  every part of the world have shed blood, and  suffered untold horrors at the hands of the  powers that be.  Women in India:  A Profile  In India, tens of thousands of women in  the cities and countryside were mobUized to  walk shoulder to shoulder with men, and in  some instances lead them in the struggle for  India's national independence.  In the 20's, 30's and 40's, women of  the urban middle classes, for the first time  emerged out of the confining waUs of their  homes to experience a new found sense of  self-worth, dignity and freedom. For the  first time, these women found themselves  entering the public arena of civic and pohtical hfe with a sense of confidence and equality. This experience of struggle changed the  world view of the middle class women of India; no longer would they be content with  their second class status in a country which  claims to have shaken off the yoke of colonial  rule, and professes to be the largest democracy in the world.  However, after India achieved pohtical independence in 1947, to their chagrin the  women found that they, hke some other oppressed groups had merely been used by the  pohticians to catapult themselves into positions of power. Though some paltry concessions were made to the women, yet the fundamental promises made to them were belied, and their hopes squashed.  In the countryside, poor peasant women  continue under the grind of economic want,  indigence, superstition and UI health. Patriarchal and feudal values deeply entrenched  even among large sections of the women  continue to take their toll on the hves of  women in the form of female infanticide,  bride burning for dowry and female feticide.  Women's freedom certainly did not come  with India's freedom.  The organised sections of the women's  movement in India has resolved that if the  women could rise to fight for the independence of India and her people, they would  not rest untU that task is completed. Four  decades have elapsed since India gained pohtical freedom, but her women, her religious, ethnic and linguistic minorities, her  chUdren and her poor are not free.  Women as a gender and women as members of these disadvantaged groups suffer  the worst atrocities and hardships. According to official figures published last year by  the government of India in a Draft National Perspective Plan For Women:  1988-2000 A.D., 150 million of India's 370  million women hve in conditions of gruelling  poverty and many more close to it.  According to the same document, by the  year 2000 A.D., there will be 20 million  more males in India than females. Even  though more female chUdren are born in India than males, due to preferential treatment given to the male chUd in terms  of nutrition and health care, this report  says that, "age specific death rates indicate  higher rates for female chUdren and women  till 35 years of age."  As per the 1981 census in India, 75 percent of the women are illiterate. This is compounded by the high drop out rate for girls  which is 55.5 percent at the primary stage  and 77.7 percent at the middle school stage.  The same census reports that 89.5 percent  of the women workers were engaged in the  unorganized sector. Of these, 82.3 percent  The advent of an uprooted people from  the other side of the globe into Canada,  lured by the dream of a better future and  a welcoming home is bound to conflict with  reality and create tensions. The women of  this community who find themselves being  stamped with the label 'immigrant and visible minority women' discover their dreams  of 'Bread and Roses' wUting before their  eyes.  These visible minority women are pushed  into dingy pockets of the Canadian economy. They scurry in and out of these pockets, remaining virtuaUy invisible in the  labour force. An overwhelming majority of  In British Columbia, an overwhelming majority of the South Asian immigrant female  labour force works as seasonal farm workers, in canneries and in garment factories.  The women discover their  dreams of "Bread and Roses"  wilting before their eyes.  were in agriculture and allied occupations.  In the organized sector, only 13.3 percent of  aU employees are women.  We also learn from the Draft Plan figures that female job seekers through employment exchanges increased from 1.12  million in 1975 to 5.1 million in 1986. Currently 51 lakhs matriculate women in India are unemployed. If we look at the representation of women in some government  jobs, a very bleak picture unfolds. In the  Indian Administrative services (IAS) there  are only 339 women as against 4,209 men  (7.5 percent), and in the Indian Pohce Services (IPS) only 21 women as against 2,439  men (0.9 percent).  The women's movement in India has a  long and arduous path to traverse, and it  has indeed risen to the caU of the day with  dynamic energy and an ingenuity of which  we are aU proud.  Women of South Asian Origin in the  Vancouver Area: A Profile  Over the last 20 years in particular, the  South Asian community in the Vancouver  region has grown manifold. Approximate estimates place this population in a range of  90 to 100 thousand. Given the trend in international migrations, this figure wUl sweU  considerably by the turn of the 21st century.  the South Asian immigrant female labour  force in the Fraser VaUey is huddled on  farms as seasonal farm workers; ghettoized  into poorly ht, smeUy fish and food canneries; isolated in huge offices and urban buddings at night, scrubbing the floors and toilets; scuttling around in hot, stuffy kitchens  in restaurants, washing dishes; bent over  sewing machines for long hours in garment  factories; or sitting crouched behind the  walls of their own homes sewing or knitting  for contractors.  AU these jobs which absorb South Asian  women workers, effectively remove them  from the purview and concern of the unions,  labour legislation, benefits, employment securities, and health and day care regulations. Unaware of their rights and regulations, constrained by their lack of the English language, and pressed by economic  need, these immigrant and visible minority women are the most ideal workers as  far as the businesses and management are  concerned. They are easUy exploitable and  yield large pecuniary gains for their employers without questioning, without ever striking work and without ever asking for more.  Furthermore, their obedience, diligence and  lack of information makes them easy prey  to manipulation and sexual harassment.  One janitorial worker reported that for  six months she worked under constant fear  of being sexuaUy harassed by her supervisor  who would lurk in the corridors and pounce  upon her each time she went to clean the  men's washroom. Scared of losing her job  and being scolded and misunderstood by  her husband, her only recourse was fervent  prayers to avert the untoward.  Lack of any stipulated facilities in these  marginalized sectors of the economy are  fairly common knowledge to those of us  who are concerned with these issues. On the  farms, women workers crouch under bushes  to relieve themselves, and chUdren invariably come home each night with their httle hmbs scratched from playing around the  thorny berry bushes.  However, these are the least harmful of  the occupational hazards. AUergies, on account of protracted contact with pesticides  and chemicals are very common among  women and chUdren. Garment workers regularly complain of failing or watery eyes and  cricks in their necks and shoulders.  One woman, who was a dishwasher in a  seafood restaurant developed blistery eruptions aU over her hands and forearms on account of an aUergy to seafood. Besides, having their upper hmbs soaked in hot water  with detergents for eight to ten hours of the  day is bound to corrode even the most hardy  of skins.  The hazards at the work place for immigrant women of the South Asian community  " are many and severe. These, combined with  jj the strain of aU the housework and chUd  i care take a serious toU on their health. Pres-  •■=   sures of being suspended between two cul-  * tures, racial discrimination, rebeUious and  * truant chUdren and the constant pain of  1 inner isolation often transforms the domestic sphere into an arena of scarce emotional  nourishment and much abuse and violence.  The women, more than any other section, misunderstood and ignored, appear to  be hving hke prisoners of war in a strange  concentration camp in an alien land. On account of this, they are truly a group at risk,  and their situation cries for immediate attention. It may be true that to some extent, the South Asian immigrant men share  the same predicament and prejudices. But  it must never be forgotten that in a male  dominated society governed by patriarchal  norms, men on the whole still have far more  options and choices than women.  A few groups have mushroomed in the  South Asian community over the recent  past to address social concerns. Some of  these are overtly pohtical groups, whUe others focus on the advancement of cultural  and social issues. Some of these organizations have also tried to address the specific  concerns of the women of this community.  One such organization that is exclusively a  women's organization is the India Mahila  Association (IMA), formed in 1973.  The India MahUa Association is one of  the earliest established women's group  the South Asian community. It is comprised  of women who trace their origin to the countries of the Indian subcontinent and has  since its inception continued to represent  the women of the large and growing South  Asian community in the Vancouver region.  It must be noted that this organization has buUt considerable credibility in the  South Asian community as well as in the  mainstream women's movement by sponsoring joint programs and events with other  women's groups.

KINESIS International  .XXXXXXXXXXNXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  NjSxxx>Sxx*xxx**xXX^^^  India  Population controls override choice  by Dorothy Kidd  "We ask for bread, they give us  pills."  "Abortion, we didn't have to fight for  it, we were just given it. The women's  movement in India never had to struggle for it... abortion has been given as  a legalized thing to control population  so it can be used in all sorts of ways  to which we have objection ... The fact  that women also now are being pressurized into sterilization and all sorts of  contraception can be linked to that right  to abortion which we have got."  No mountains, but the view of open blue  sky across the wide expanse of ocean took  me home in my mind. I was waiting for a  Bombay bus on a marine drive much hke  the one in West Vancouver. I had just spoken to Nandita Gandhi and Nandita Shah of  the Forum Against Oppression of Women.  Nandita Gandhi's statement that the Indian  abortion law does not guarantee reproductive rights also reminded me of Canada. After a year without one, it seemed that a new  Canadian abortion law would only hinder  choice.  Pushing to get on the bus, I started to  think about the very different kind of struggle that women in India wage for reproductive rights. They are not fighting for abortion on demand. The 1971 Indian law guar-  the massive Victorian buddings I walked  through in downtown Bombay. But there's  a new wrinkle to the Malthusian idea that  population has to be checked in order to  guarantee food supply. Now the belief comes  not just from the British mercantUe interests that buUt Bombay, but from the World  Bank.  The World Bank provides India with capital for development—to increase their food  and other commodity supplies. As part of  the coUateral India must provide a target  for population control. The pressure to fiU  those targets, and thereby get more capital  into the country, drives the Indian government to use drugs and birth control methods that are banned or no longer used in  most Western countries.  This kind of thinking and financial pressure led to Indira Gandhi's programme of  forced sterUizations in the mid-1970's. The  violent reactions to the programme were  also a major factor in her electoral defeat.  Since then, Nandita Gandhi told me, "the  Indian government has learned its lesson."  For one thing, they rely much more on  incentives to convince people to voluntarily  sterilize, and "the incentives are hnked up  with the socio-economic conditions at that  time, so it's during the lean period that a  lot of people get family planmng methods  inserted or get sterUization ... Or a lot of  times famUy planning is hnked with rehef  The Indian government uses drugs and  birth control methods that are banned or  no longer used in most western countries.  antees that. Instead they are fighting to  >se to have chUdren and to choose the  circumstances, regardless of their economic  or social status. While in Canada, the campaign for choice has to counter many religious beliefs, in India the strongest behef  women have to counter is a secular one,  that the need for population control overrides women's choice.  It's a behef that Nandita Gandhi said, "is  reinforced by your own immediate experience of people ... you go in buses, you go  in trains, loads and loads of people. You also  keep feehng I'm not getting certain things  because there's too many people asking for  I climbed through the passengers to get  off the bus, thinking about what Nandita  Shah had said in response: "There's too  many people in the cities because there are  no jobs in the rural areas, so most people  come to cities ... It has been adequately  proved that there is enough food in India  to be able to give it to everyone. There is  tgh space in India so that everyone can  be housed and there is enough resources in  India so that everyone can be clothed and  be properly in a hving style.  But it's the whole question of distribution ... so the rich get richer and the  poor get poorer and the propaganda is that  only the poor are producing more ... I  suppose that in the West that's the propaganda about aU Third World countries, that  women produce so many chUdren ...  "(Yet) if you look at infant mortality in  India, a mother who produces five chUdren  is never sure that even two of them wUl survive. There is also no system of (the) state  taking responsibility for old people ... You  have to have one or two chUdren survive and  for that you have to produce."  It's an old behef—that people are poor  because they have many chUdren, rather  than they have many chUdren because they  are poor. A behef about the same age as  work in places of drought."  For another thing, from a programme  where 79 percent of the sterUizations were  on men, "they've shifted to aU the methods  oriented to women." Nandita Shah added  that the "whole hysteria about population  explosion and what's going to happen to India" is used to justify drugs such as Depo  Provera and Netan that have been banned  in the West. The government thinking is  that "women are illiterate and they don't  understand what is good for the country so  we have the right (to use these drugs) ...  "Women are not even told they are part  of an experiment so there is no question of  informed consent and it completely violates  the WHO's (World Health Organization)  recommendation on how research should be  conducted."  After a campaign against Depo Provera,  women's groups in India are trying to have  Netan banned. Like Depo Provera, Netan  has a lot of nasty side effects. This West  German surplus product has been found  to be carcinogenic and causes tremendous  chaos in the menstrual cycle, including  heavy bleeding—very dangerous in a country where many women suffer from anemia.  The dangers and the unethical testing procedures are part of the argument five different women's groups are using in cases in the  Indian Supreme Court against this drug.  Nandita and Nandita talked to many  other women's groups as part of a book they  are compihng on the Indian women's movement. None of them, as Nandita Shah said,  "have agreed to the general propaganda of  it being population explosion. Most of the  groups are talking about having more control by the women to decide if they want the  birth control methods and not by the state  imposed."  Calling for bans on drugs and technology  imported from the West is only one of the  approaches, for they know that as soon as  one technique or drug is banned, then an-  The dangers and the unethical testing  procedures are part of the argument five  different women's groups are using in cases  in the Indian Supreme Court against this drug.  other wUl be introduced. For example, as  Nandita Shah said, "Because there's been  so much hue and cry about Netan, they're  planning to use subdermal implants which  are implanted under the skin and go on for  two years."  Another approach of women's groups  has been to advocate experimenting with  more natural methods. "There is no interest by the state or other companies because  there's nothing to seU in it, so it wUl have  to be women's organizations' responsibility  to actually create new methods." The researchers testing these methods with viUage  women have also taken care to involve them  in the research.  The talk with Nandita and Nandita was  on my last day in India. Later that day  a taxi rushed me north past aU the huge  modern houses of Bombay's wealthy, then  slowed down through the crowded streets of  one of the city's largest slums before reaching the airport. A stark contrast for sure.  But I also remembered the new song popularized by Jagori, a women's resource centre in Delhi. "We ask for bread, they give  us pUls." They have not stopped asking.  Indeed as Abba Bhayya from Jagori told  me: "We are demanding greater and greater  control over our own bodies, as weU as giving a critique of government pohcies and  programs." For Abba, Nandita and Nandita, as weU as the women and men in many  other groups, the campaign for reproductive choice continues to be hnked with ending poverty by redistributing wealth.  J<INESIS international  Mozambique  Building equality among nations  as told to Louie Ettling  Graca Machel, currently a member  of the Mozambique's Secretariat of the  Women's Organization, was in Vancouver in mid-March on a speaking  tour to raise support for Mozambique,  adding that country's voice to the call  of the Front Line States for sanctions against South Africa. Since 1982,  Mozambique has been severely disrupted  by Pretoria backed RENAMO forces  which have attempted to de-stabilize the  country through an unrelenting campaign of guerilla warfare.       s  Machel was trained as a freedom  fighter in the fight against Portuguese  colonialism and was Minister of Education in Mozambique for fourteen years.  She is currently a member of the Central Committee of the Frente de Lib-  eraco de Mozamibque (FRELIMO) the  only legal political party in Mozambique. She is also a Deputy of the  People Assembly and President of the  Mozambican children's organization.  Graca Machel's speech was recorded  by Louie Ettling at a press conference  and at a public meeting. What follows  is a shortened transcript of Machel's  speech in which she posed and answered  a series of questions which painted a  picture of life in Mozambique today.  Who do I represent? I represent whatever you want! (she laughs heartUy). You  can look at me as a person, you know. I am  just Graca Machel. I think people have invited me (to speak) because of what I have  been in the government and in the party. I  am involved with women and chUdren. I can  talk about different aspects of Mozambican  society. I have no right to be here. It's just  one voice more from Mozambique.  Why are there not peaceful negotiations  in Southern Africa?, you may ask. A number of points: The sixties was a decade of independence in Southern Africa, but today,  twenty years later, the struggle in the region  stUl continues. The reason is that white minorities have been trying to monopolize this  part of Africa. There was Rhodesia and now  there is South Africa,  FRELIMO was the first movement in  Southern Africa to win against colonial  power (Portuguese, 1752-1975) foUowed by  Angola and Zimbabwe and today we are  hoping for Namibia. When FRELIMO came  to power it changed the dynamics in the region. In 1976 the struggle in South Africa  entered a new phase (the student uprisings  in Soweto). We defined ourselves as anti-  racist societies. We understand that people are equal and we are trying to buUd  this equahty among nations. South Africa  cannot accept this obligation of equahty at  its front door. That is why they have this  strategy of destabilization, to put Mozambique underneath. So we have not experienced peace since independence.  What is the main problem in Southern  Africa? On the one hand there are people working towards developing the weU being of their own people and, on the other  hand, there is South Africa that wants to  be the representative of the West in the region. South Africa is trying to impose domination and economic control, to destabilize  and to counteract the revolution we are trying to buUd in our own countries. The main  problem is not between Mozambicans and  Mozambicans. This is not a civU war but  aggression by South Africa.  What is the attitude of the rest of the  world? Why is our suffering not shaking  the consciousness of the world to say stop  it? Since independence, 100,000 people have  been kUled by the bandits (RENAMO)  backed by Pretoria. Over two hundred thou  sand chUdren have been orphaned. Pretoria  can only sustain this because South Africa is  one of the richest areas in the world and the  West wants its natural resources, agricultural products and minerals. As weU as access to its geographicaUy strategic positions.  There is no reason why people in Southern Africa should continue to die because  of gold, diamonds, etc. Why should we be  abused, raped and deprived of our families!  What wUl happen to our chUdren over  the next decades? Other than military and  economic destabilization, the problem today is social destabilization. We have decided that we don't want orphanages. We  would hke families to adopt the chUdren.  Preferably in the same area where the chUdren hved and where their mother tongue  is spoken. We react to destruction by re-  buUding normal hfe. This is our response to  apartheid. We can rebuUd houses, schools,  hospitals, but how do we help traumatised  people? How far wUl we be able to rebuUd chUdren emotionaUy, psychologicaUy  and mentaUy—now that they have become  victims of the war?  Despite the destruction of schools we try  to reorganize education in camps for the  displaced, in refugee camps. We don't need  buddings first. We need teachers and students. Schools are being rebuUt with the  help of communities. We are developing in  the areas of illiteracy, adult education and  the training of teachers to deal with the  problem of traumatised chUdren, to help  chUdren become chUdren again. We need  help with this. Support and education is not  only budding infrastructures and schools,  POSITION  ZAMBIA  ]      \^NZANIA_J>j  Mozambique's geographi  cal position should make it  /   M \     \      Niassa    ,       Delgado I  the ideal trade and trans  port route for its landlocked  jt~*'  rr" ""'7  neighbours.

The Organization of Mozambican Women  (OMM) is one of the mass organizations we  have that aUow people to organize themselves. There are also youth, workers, writers and many others.  EQUALITY  Frelimo insists that women 'must emancipate themselves'—but tradition  is not so easily overcome.  •90 percent of Mozambican women are unpaid, peasant farmers. Yet there is  no mechanism for consulting them about agricultural policy.  •Although 40 percent of primary school entrants are female half of those will  drop out before reaching secondary school—usually due to domestic duties.  •Sexual initiation rites take two months and reinforce the traditional attitudes  about women's role and status.  •Polygamy persists (though the Party disapproves) and often results in women  with children receiving insufficient support from their menfolk.  •Lobolo or bride price can be exorbitant and turn marriage into a business  deal between men with the women as the merchandise.  But the legal status of women has improved dramatically under Frelimo.  •On divorce the woman is entitled to half the family property and has child custody rights that are at least equal to that of the man.  •Sexual discrimination in employment is illegal. Paid maternity leave is a statutory right and workplaces employing a large number of women must provide  creches.  OMM was formed as a response to what  women felt as a need for participation in  society. This came during the armed struggle. It is the most powerful organization in  Mozambique. Let's hope that youth wiU try  to become as strong as the women.  We understand that women have been  discriminated in different ways in colonial  times, and in traditional life. So, with a  struggle for independence aU of us, men  and women, had to hberate ourselves. Men  would not liberate women. We have been  helping to promote participation of women  in different areas of national activities. Also  on different levels of the decision making  process, you know.  It's an encouragement for women to bring  their energy and potential and to exercise  their rights as citizens and participate in  aU things. We don't see women as closed to  themselves. No. It is to bring women in as  part of the whole process. Now we say economic and social development is our task.  On the other hand, we have to defend the  country to maintain sovereignty and fight  the bandits. Women defend their belongings, families and vUlages. They also participate in different fields of economic development. Either in agriculture where they  are the main producers, or in industry,  ucation, health—whatever you want. Even  in the Party—also in People's Power—these  are the different areas which are elected to  represent the people. Women are increasingly participating.  How is culture expressed in a country  that is in the midst of war? It is not easy to  talk about the vitahty of culture in Mozambique. You have to see it, touch it, experience it. The government is not able to  give a lot of material support. We have  been encouraging those who caU themselves  artists to express what they feel. The artists  are not only trying to survive, hke the  whole country, but also to be spokespeople  for what we all experience; our hopes, our  dreams, our setbacks. They have been part  of the society and of the pohtical process  that is taking place.  But we understand culture also not as  something which is made by those who are  known as artists, because who buUds culture are people themselves. That's why we  encourage art wherever we are—in vUlages,  in schools, even by workers in hospitals.  See Mozambique pg. 16  KINESIS as told to Cyndi Mellon  Yoh Garcia is a Guatemalan sculptor,  now hving in Vancouver. Her work has begun to attract attention. In 1988 one of her  sculptures was commissioned by the B.C.  Human Rights Coalition to be used as the  organization's Renata Shearer Award.  It wiU be presented each year to a B.C.  resident who makes an outstanding contribution in the area of human rights.  I spoke with Yoh about her hfe as an  artist and as a refugee.  Kinesis: Can you tell me a bit  about your childhood and youth in  Guatemala ?  Yoli: What I have to say about my chUd-  hood isn't very pretty. There are some interesting things, of course, but I would say that  I had a very hard chUdhood, since at about  the age of ten I began to have work respon-  sibUities that I beheve aren't fair for a chUd.  A chUd should hve its chUdhood. A young  person should hve their youth, and then  when we are adults, weU, then we should  take up our responsibilities. But, unfortunately, the system in Guatemala doesn't  permit us to have a real chUdhood or youth.  Take school, for example. The percentage  of chUdren who get to go to school is very  low. In my case, I was lucky enough to finish primary school on the banana plantation  where I grew up. After grade six I wanted  to go to secondary school, but for that you  had to go to town-a bus ride of about an  hour. My parents' economic situation was  such that there wasn't enough money for  me to pay the bus fare and also eat lunch.  It was impossible.  When I was about sixteen, one of the  unions decided to do something about the  kids hving on the plantation. They got us  a httle bus-it was reaUy httle and we were  really crowded. But we went to town that  way and I was able to go to high school for  a whUe. But this only lasted a httle over a  year.  Something that I'd hke to mention is that  whUe this was going on, the sons and daughters of the farm administrators had a special  httle train that would come to take them to  a school where they were learning Enghsh,  among other things. But that was just for  them. We weren't aUowed to use it.  When I was eighteen I moved to the capital and when I was twenty I got married.  Yoli: No. Unfortunately I hadn't yet discovered that I had any ability. My time was  very limited, because I was busy taking care  of the chUdren and going to school.  The only thing I did was make clothes,  because I liked doing it. And...I admire my  father. I never hved with him. I didn't meet  him till I was grown up. He was paralyzed  as the result of an accident. He could only  move his fingers! Not even his hands, just his  fingers. And he made sculptures. He hved in  an institution and he had won several competitions for his sculptures. I must have inherited some of his ability.  Kinesis: When did you start doing  sculpture?  Pretty soon my first daughter was born, so  then I waited till she was old enough to start  kindergarten so I could get back to school. I  started going to a colegio (a private school)  because the public schools wouldn't let a  married woman attend classes.  But then my second chUd was born so  I had to quit again. To make a long story  short, I did it. I nearly finished secondary  school. I never got my diploma, but I just  about finished. By then I had three chUdren.  Kinesis: Were you doing any art  work at that time?  Yoli: To answer that question I have to  tell you about why we left Guatemala.  When I hved in Guatemala, I think we  were experiencing the same kind of thing  that most other families were hving. We  were concerned with our own survival problems. At that time I never really thought  about the pohtical situation. I mean, I could  see the problems, but I didn't have time to  think about what was behind it aU...what  was causing it. Because the situation is such  that one spends aU their time trying to get  enough money to keep going.  Anyway, one day my husband's younger  brother-he was a student at the university-  disappeared. If I'm not mistaken, it was  on a Thursday night. He just didn't show  up. But we just figured he'd run into some  friends. Maybe he'd had a few drinks and  didn't want to deal with his parents. Something normal, right? By Friday we began  to get worried. We started looking in the  hospitals, at the pohce stations, in the  morgues...talking to his friends.  Kinesis: Were disappearances as  common at that time as they are now?  Yoli: There were disappearances, but  usuaUy the person reappeared, only they  were dead. They didn't go to as much trouble to hide what they were doing. Looking  back, I think it was the beginning of a new  Yoli Garcia:  A new design for freedom  So, when I started feeling good, I went  back to school again. Only this time I went  to art school.  Anyway, after a whUe his body turned  up and we went to the morgue to identify him. It was terrible to see. He was unrecognizable because he had been tortured  and then buried and then dug up again. His  knees had been broken. The doctor told us  it seemed as if he had been pressed with a  heavy weight, since aU the bones in his upper body had been smashed to the size of  about one inch. They'd cut out his tongue.  And finally they had shot him through the  mouth and the buUet had come out his left  ear. It was completely savage. His body had  turned grey from being buried and his poor  father had to scrape his skin with a knife in  order to look for identifying scars.  That's enough about that. He was a very  human and a very helpful person, and many  people loved him a lot.  Anyway, after that they began to harass  us. We started getting anonymous phone  calls. Some of these were aimed at coming  between my husband and I. For instance,  someone would call and demand that my  husband start paying chUd support to a;  woman who was supposed to have had his  chUd.  Then they started intimidating our  friends. They would stop them on the corner near our house and tell them to avoid  us because we were dangerous.  One day, whUe at work, my husband received a direct death threat. We knew we  had to get out of the country. We had the  chUdren to think, about.  My husband left first, and, for a time, I  stayed on with the kids. That was a terrible time. Every night a patrol would come  and harass us. There was a httle window in  my front door, and they would shine a spotlight through it, as if to say:"Here we are!"  It was psychological torture, and, as you can  imagine, my nerves were shot.  Right around that time I heard about  a family who had been cut up into httle  pieces. They put the pieces into some oU  drums and carried them out of their house  that way. I was afraid that was going to happen to us!  The first place we went was Costa Rica,  but we never really felt settled there. We  decided to go to Nicaragua.  And it was in Nicaragua that we finaUy  began to hve a different sort of hfe. For the  first time in a long time I could send my  And it was in the sculpture workshop that I  really felt hke I'd found myself. I really enjoyed it! And I started to sculpt.  Kinesis: What year was this?  Yoli: This was in '82 or '83. Anyway,  after a few years we decided to move to  Mexico. The company my husband worked  for offered him a job there. I really wanted  to go-not because I didn't hke hving in  Nicaragua, because I did-but because I  hadn't seen anyone in my family for so long.  I had this idea that it might be easier to see  them. I thought we might be able to bring  some of them to Mexico.  Anyway, we went. Unfortunately, the job  didn't work out. I think it must have been  the worst year of my hfe! (laughter). We  were in really bad shape financially. We  were there about a year.  Anyway, someone told us that the government of Canada was accepting families  who were in real need of help. We were, so  we went to the embassy and they accepted  us. And so we came to Canada.  One positive thing that happened whUe  we were hving in Mexico was that I got to  know a Guatemalan sculptor called Edgar  Guzman. He is a recognized sculptor and he  is also a refugee. He became my teacher and  he really helped me a lot.  Kinesis: What would you say are the  central themes of your work?  Yoli: I think the most important theme I  am working with is human rights. I also try  to show people in other countries what hfe  is hke in Guatemala. I want them to know  what's happening in my country. And not  just in my country, but in other parts of  Latin America as weU.  It makes me sad when people ask me  where I'm from and when I say, "I'm  Guatemalan," they say, "Where's that?"  "Is that near Australia?" "Isn't that in the  Philippines?" Anyway, I think it's important for people to learn about what's happening in other places.  Kinesis: I notice you use a lot of images of women and children in your  work.  Yoli: Yes. Those are the themes I'm  working with. The violation of human  rights, the situation of women, and the situation of chUdren. As I said before, a chUd is  a chUd. It's not right that a chUd four years  kids to school in the morning knowing that  they would come back in the afternoon. Because I had gotten into thinking that every  time I said good-bye to them, I was seeing  them for the last time.  So, when I started feehng good, I went  back to school again. Only this time I went  to art school.  Kinesis: Why art school?  Yoli: Because, ever since I was a httle  girl, I had always hked to draw. But then,  as I said, I had to start working very young  and aU that was put aside. But then I remembered it, and I thought that was what I  wanted to do. At the art school we also had  to take courses in anatomy and in sculpture.  Inocencia/lnnocence, 1988  old, who can barely hft a machete, should  have to work in the fields with its parents.  We want a just society. We want our chUdren to have the same opportunities that  chUdren have here. We want to be valued  as human beings.  Kinesis: Some of your sculpted images show women wearing traditional  ethnic dress.  Yoli: My sculptures often portray injustice, and the indigenous people in my country have experienced tremendous discrimination and exploitation.  Guatemala is a smaU country, but it has  a complex society. There are a lot of different ethnic groups, and they each have their  own clothing. This clothing is very beautiful to look at but it has often been exploited  in tourist advertising.  In some of the traditional dances, the  dancers wear masks. I would hope that anyone who goes to Guatemala-and beheve me,  it is a very beautiful country-would try to  look at what is hidden behind the masks.  People say that our country is backward.  We are not backward. We are exploited  That is quite a different matter.  Kinesis: Where do you get ideas for  your work?  Yoli: Usually my first inspiration for a  piece- comes from something I read. I hke  to read about what's happening right now.  And I look at photographs, because it's impossible for me to work from a model. And  when I think there's something other people should know about, I go to work.  AU my sculptures have a message.  They're personal. They express what I feel.  There's a reason for everything in them.  Kinesis: What are you working on  right now?  Yoli: Right now I'm working on a series.  It's a project I'm doing with Edgar. It's going to consist of twenty pieces. I would hke  for this series to travel around the world so  the present time, the bronze statue, entitled  "Why," sits in the office of Vancouver's Persons With AIDS Coalition," where founder  Kevin Brown was the 1988 recipient of the  award. The office is located at U70 Bute  Esperanza/Hope, 1987  I want to help my people and I'd like to  get really good at what I'm doing...become  a really good artist. That's my dream.  that a lot of people can see it. I would also  hke to find a way- right now I don't know  how-for this series to generate some money.  And some of this money would go to the  projects of the Guatemalan refugees hving  in the camps in Mexico, and some would be  used to help me continue doing this work.  I need to re-work pieces sometimes to keep  the series up-to-date.  Anyway, when the twenty pieces are  ready, we want to find an organization that  can take charge of the collection and see  that it can travel.  I keep saying "we" because I couldn't  possibly do this work alone. I get a lot of  support from my famUy. There is also a  group of Canadian people who help me in  aU kinds of ways.  I am in the process of having pieces cast  in bronze. This would be very expensive to  do in Canada. But since I know the scene  in Mexico I've been able to have it done at  a much lower price. Some people here even  paid for my plane fare to Mexico so that I  could begin the process.  Other people have photographed my  work and a series of postcards have been  made up. These used to be for sale, but now  I save what's left of them. I send them to  people who are interested in helping with  this work.  Kinesis: Where have you shown your  work?  Yoli: The fact is that I don't really have  very many pieces yet. I've only been doing this for about five years. I had one  show together with some paintings by a  Guatemalan painter named Roberto Cabrera. That show was only for one day. I've  also shown my work at activities organized  by churches and, in one case, at a women's  event.  One thing that happened was the human  rights award. The piece commissioned by  the B.C. Human Rights Commission portrays the head of an indigenous woman. At  Street in Vancouver, and staff members say  that visitors are welcome to drop in and  view the sculpture.  Kinesis: As a working person, what  have you been doing in order to earn a  living and still keep going artistically?  Yoli: When I first got here I thought I'd  go to work. My husband and I both got factory jobs. We saw pretty quickly that with  what we were earning, we could barely make  the household expenses. And we'd come  home drained.  There was no time to do art. As I said,  before I can make a sculpture, I have to  go through that whole process of reading,  thinking. Something has to compel me to  do it. And in those days the only thing  wanted to do was go to sleep!  So I finaUy decided to work at home at  what I know how to do. I started making  clothes for people. But it's funny. Sometimes people call me and they say, "Are you  sure you can make a dress without a pattern?" And I say, "AU you have to do is  show me what you want." But when they  hear my Enghsh, they think I don't understand them. Sometimes they prefer to go  elsewhere. But httle by httle people have  been coming. It's barely enough to survive  on, but I keep doing it.  Kinesis: Where do you see yourself  going from here ?  Yoli: WeU, I've got a couple of objectives.  The main thing is, I want to help my people. I feel my work is a contribution that I  am able to make. And as I said before, I'd  hke to be able to give some economic support to the refugees in Mexico.  And the other thing I'd hke to do is get  ready good at what I'm doing...become a ready good artist. That's my dream. It's going to be difficult. I don't know if I can do it  here because of the language, and not having enough time, and so on. Anyhow, those  are my main wishes.  Kinesis: Is there anything else you'd  like to say?  Yoli: Yes. I'd hke to thank Kinesis for  giving me the chance to talk to people about  my work. And I'd hke to thank aU the people who've been helping me, for example the  photographers who have volunteered to take  pictures of my work. To aU of you I'd hke to  say thank you, in the name of my people.  Yoli's sculptures are currently pari  of a show called "Refugee/Refugiado,"  which will take place at the Langham  Arts Centre in Kaslo, B.C. throughout  the month of April.  Frontera/At the Border, 1984  Porque?/Why? terracotta, 1986  XiNESIS  KINESIS The Charter  ^^xxx^jxxx^xx^^^  \SxxxSxx$SSS*xx$x^^  Decision supports equality demands  by Gwen Brodsky  Equahty rights activists awaited the  Supreme Court of Canada decision in Andrews, anxiously. This was the first challenge to be heard by the highest Court of  Canada, under s. 15, of the Charter which  guarantees equahty before and under the  law, and equal protection and benefit of the  law without discrimination on the grounds  of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disabil-  ity.  On February 2, 1989, the decision  was released. Headlines in major Canadian newspapers said: COURT RULES  LAWYERS DON'T NEED CITIZENSHIP.  AndreioachaUenged the British Columbia  legislation restricting the practice of law  to Canadian citizens. In a 4-2 ruhng, the  Court held that British Columbia's citizenship requirement violated s. 15, and struck  it down. This was the bottom-line, so to  speak.  Of concern to equahty rights activists,  however, was not so much the bottom hne,  but the manner in which the Court dealt  with the question of how the equahty guarantee should be interpreted.  The fact that the first Supreme Court  of Canada case was about lawyers' professional concerns and not about pay equity, accessible buddings, the problem of  sex harassment, minimum wages for domestic workers or any other item high on the  agenda of equahty seeking groups is a disappointment, and a reflection of a larger reality about Charter litigation. Most Charier  litigation has been initiated by privUeged  individuals hke the white male professional  who initiated this court chaUenge. Members  of truly disadvantaged groups have lacked  the resources to get their equahty concerns  before the courts. Nonetheless, disadvantaged groups are affected by judicial interpretations of the Charter in wide ranging  circumstances, including those concerning  privUeged professional men.  There is some good news. First, the  judges paid a lot of attention to the concept  of disadvantage, saying things hke, "[legislative] distinctions should not bring about or  reinforce the disadvantage of certain groups  and individuals by denying them the rights  freely accorded to others," and "... s. 15  is designed to protect those groups who suffer social, pohtical and legal disadvantage in  our society..." (WUson J.). This is a definite improvement on the decisions of judges  in the lower courts who, in four years of pre  liminary grappling with s. 15 have faded to  acknowledge even that there are disadvantaged groups in Canada.  A second piece of good news is that  the Court acknowledged that s. 15 provides much more extensive protection than  the equahty clause of the Canadian BUl  of Rights. The Court recognized that the  wording of s. 15 was deliberately chosen to  overcome defects in the BUl, and it expUcitly  rejected narrow interpretations of equahty  which led to such narrow rulings under the  BUl as Bliss in which it was held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not  discrimination on the basis of sex.  The main context in which the Court  concerned itself with the concept of disadvantage was in deciding whether to extend  the protection of s. 15 on the basis of citizenship discrimination. Because citizenship  is not expressly mentioned in s. 15, although  certain other grounds such as sex and race  to employer-sponsored health benefits, but  rather how meaningful that protection wUl  be when judges are actuaUy confronted with  lesbians rights claims to specific benefits.  This approach, that is, focussing on disadvantage as a central criterion for inclusion  in s. 15, is potentiaUy more significant because it gives us language with which to differentiate women's s. 15 claims from those of  advantage groups such as men using the sex  equahty guarantee to chaUenge rape laws,  maternity benefits and other "special" laws  for women. In view of the high number of  such chaUenges that have been launched in  the lower courts, and the consequent losses  that women have experienced, it is critical  that the courts begin to understand that inequality is a problem of women and of certain groups of disadvantaged men such as  gays,men of colour and men with disabilities, but not of men generaUy or of the business sector.  ..suffers from thinness...  and disabUity are, the Court had to articulate a rationale for extending s. 15 protection to non-citizens.  The judges focussed on the concept of  disadvantage as the determinative theme  for extension of s. 15 protection. For example, La Forest noted that non-citizens are  a group of persons who are relatively powerless pohticaUy whose interests are hkely  to be compromised by legislative decisions.  And, Mclntyre, who wrote the majority  judgment on this issue, indicated that s. 15  protection could be extended to unenumer-  ated grounds if they were "analogous" to  the enumerated grounds which, he felt, reflect the most common and probably the  most sociaUy destructive and historicaUy  practised bases of discrimination.  This interpretive approach to the question of who gets s. 15 protection helps  women when applied to sexual orientation,  another unlisted ground.Tt points in the direction of inclusion rather than exclusion.  In other words, on the basis of Andrews,  it is fair to say that lesbians have constitutional equahty rights. But this was never  very contentious. As far as lesbian equahty  rights are concerned, the big question is not  whether s. 15 protection wUl be avaUable to  lesbians to htigate such issues as entitlement  H the courts persistently adopt the view  that equahty claims of aU groups and individuals are essentiaUy on the same footing, s. 15 wUl become at best meaningless,  and at worst it wUl be detrimental to the  equahty aspirations of the groups that need  it the most. Fortunately, in future cases it  wUl be possible to draw on the language in  Andrews to support women's demands for  measures that wUl promote their equahty of  condition.  The bad news is that the court's commitment to the concept of disadvantage does  not bear close analysis. For example, whUe  Mclntyre adopts what he calls an "analogous grounds" approach, he does not actuaUy come out and say that a man's sex  equahty claim would not be placed on the  same footing as a woman's sex equahty  claim.  An analogous grounds approach wiU not  on its own direct courts to distinguish  between claims arising from the women's  rights movement and those forming part  of a 1980's conservative strategy to rod  back reforms won by women in the pohtical arena during the 60's and 70's. Indeed,  when Mclntyre actuaUy gets down to ap  plying his analogous grounds approach to  the ground of citizenship he makes no mention whatsoever of disadvantage. He says  that not aU distinctions based on citizenship  may amount to discrimination, but not why  it is that distinctions based on citizenship  may amount to discrimination. In fact, his  judgment is sUent even on the question of  how citizenship is analogous to the grounds  hsted in s. 15. Although WUson makes a  special point of emphasizing the importance  of assessing groups disadvantage in the context of the entire social, pohtical and legal  fabric of our society, her comments are very  cursory.  The Andrews decision suffers from such  thinness, in important places, that it would  be going too far to say that the Court has  established a definite, new, and favorable  course for Charter equahty rights. It wUl  take more than this to make s. 15 into  an effective tool for proactive litigation by  women and to aUay fears that s. 15 wUl result in more losses than gains in rights for  women.  To get a clearer idea of how s. 15 is going  to affect women's inequality in the long run,  women wUl have to wait and see how the  Court deals with a variety of s. 15 equahty  cases, particularly sex equahty chaUenges.  However, Andrews does reflect some recognition that s. 15 should assist women and  other disadvantaged groups in overcoming  their inequality. In this respect the decision  is very encouraging. Women, in particular,  can take heart from the open repudiation  of the BUl of Rights interpretations. This,  at least, is a clear reaffirmation of the success of the lobby women mounted almost a  decade ago to secure strong and broad language for Canada's new equahty guarantee.

The focus of the discontent at the  meeting was the organizational review  of NAC and its proposed implementation. The review, which had been discussed throughout the preceding year  in aU regions of the country, was undertaken in an effort to decentralize  NAC decision-making from its traditional Ontario base and re-distribute  power to grassroots women's groups in  the regions.  Re-organizational review resolutions  were passed at the 1988 meeting and  are in the process of being implemented. But the debate among member groups about NAC's role and  function continues. The foUowing article discusses NAC's process and recommends a radical re-structuring of  both NAC's process and goals; a restructuring that advocates a return to  organizing via basic feminist process.  The next NAC Annual meeting is upcoming in Ottawa in May.  by Gillian Michell, Lorraine Greaves,  and the London Feminist Process  Group  NAC: the struggle continues  nist process. This literature is insightful and  practical as far as it goes, but reading it in  the hght of the NAC experience brought a  striking oversight to hght: it is aU written  budt on the fundamental assumption that  feminists agree that a different way of working together is essential for achieving the  feminist enterprise of overturning the patriarchal world.  The truth is, however, that the need for a  feminist process is not universaUy acknowledged, and the problems of NAC arise to  an important extent from this lack of agreement. It is clear that many of the main actors in NAC are quite happy with traditional process as epitomized by the rules  jor reorientations in thinking that feminism  has produced.  Let's look more closely at this focus  on "getting the work done," which makes  NAC—or any other feminist group—so  loath to abandon formal patriarchal process. This focus reveals the primacy of task  over process in feminist practice.  The NAC Executive's current primary  task, what NAC "does," is to lobby the  federal government on legislative and policy issues. The issues NAC addresses are  very often issues which are raised by the  government; that is, it is in response to  government action—hke the election or the  Meech Lake accord or free trade c  ► the alienation of women or groups who do  not share the unified position, or who do  not share the perception that that particular issue is a priority,  ► the necessity that NAC use a process  which wiU either squelch dissent or aUow  it to be ignored to the extent that the unified position can be ramrodded through,  ► the obliteration of the record of this dissent in briefs, position papers and media  reports of the women's movement, aU of  which adds up to  » the stifling of the diversity and development of opinion among women.  For the last eight months, some feminists in London, Ontario have been  meeting to talk about feminist process  and how it might help to solve the organizational and process problems which  we believe threaten the National Action Council on the Status of Women  (NAC)'s continued existence. Sensing  that our fears for NA C may be widely  shared, we offer our ideas here in the  hope that they may help move us towards a better future for NA C in particular and Canadian feminism in general.  The central problem, as we see it, concerns the suitability of using traditional  process in feminist organizations. NAC is  certainly not the only feminist organization relying on traditional process; nevertheless, it is the largest and most visible  one in Canada. What blew the roof off  for NAC was its success. The recent dramatic increase in the number and diversity  of NAC's member groups was so unprece-  dentedly rapid that it was "unmanageable."  It was impossible for so many new groups to  be socialized graduaUy into the hitherto unquestioned process foUowed by NAC. And  this non-integration made possible the expression of a dissatisfaction that had stayed  underground in the past. NAC's growth has  revealed feminist process to be a crisis in  contemporary Canadian feminism.  NAC has been highly successful in coming to be seen as the visible feminist presence in Canada, but its internal process has  diverged from feminist values. It is at risk  of becoming a voice that doesn't represent  Canadian feminism. But with appropriate  action, the painful events of recent NAC history may come to be seen as simply symptoms of rapid growth, symptoms which can  serve as a catalyst for change within NAC  and result in a NAC which could serve as a  model for its member groups. Ignored, the  same symptoms may signal the beginning of  the end of NAC, which would be very sad—  but it might be preferable to a continuation  of NAC as it     currently.  Discussion of feminist process is of course  not new, so the London Feminist Process  (FP) group turned to the hterature on femi-  of parliamentary procedure familiarly referred to as "Robert's Rules." In fact, the  skiUed use of these rules was what made  the 1988 Annual General Meeting (AGM)  a "success" for them, despite the fact that  those same rules made the meeting distressing and disempowering for many of the participants.  So what leads us to persist with traditional process in NAC? The same reasons  that foster its use in most feminist groups:  first, it seems to get our feminist work  done, and second, it seems to be a fair way  of operating.  Robert's Rules (and alternative versions  such as Bourinot's, which are used by Parliament and some Quebec feminist groups)  operate primarily to organize participation  so that no one person can dominate the discussion, discussion stays on topic, and discussants treat one another with civility.  It doesn't sound bad so far, does it? So  what's the problem?  First, the rules are very complicated and  use a specialized jargon, so that people who  don't know them can be sdenced by those  who know how to work them. The result  is dramatic disparities of power which undermine egalitarian values and the feminist  commitment to empowering aU women.  Second, the rules work best when the issues are fairly weU-structured and clear to  everyone in advance. Since the chair can  rule out of order any questions that faU  outside this assumed structure, the rules  can be used to make free-flowing, spiralling,  thinking-it-through discussion impossible.  Which can rule out just the kind of discussion of the "given" that has led to the ma-  lation affecting pornography. Even though  NAC may have been writing briefs to the  government for years on battering or chUd-  care or rape, NAC's timing is dictated by  the government. NAC's agenda is thus very  frequently reactive, not proactive, and as a  result both the issues and the timing of any  action in response to them may often be  outside the control of NAC. Hence, as a result of this reactive task orientation, adoption of feminist process gives way to the  temporal and strategic demands of the task.  Further, because it is beheved that in  dealing with The Boys, we have to play  by The Boys' rules, we adopt The Boys'  strategies—including The Boys' process.  One of The Boys' most crucial strategies has  also been an important operating assumption in NAC, namely, that effective pohtical  action on any issue requires a single, unified,  "correct" position on that issue.  StrategicaUy such a position offers undeniable advantages. A unified position aUows  NAC to:  • show the strongest possible face of  the women's movement ("Three and a  half million Canadian women beheve/  protest/demand ... "),  • display a more understandable, accessible position to the public,  • facilitate dealing with government and  media,  • operate with clarity of focus.  All of which are desirable and make the  NAC Executive's perceived mandate easier  to carry out. But the cost is considerable,  including:  It is easy to see that the quest for unified  positions to support swift, reactive response  to government legislation creates a major  incentive for NAC participants to abuse or  manipulate NAC's process. And the cost appears to outweigh the benefits in terms of  the feminist enterprise. So one question for  NAC to ponder, then, is: Would NAC serve  the goals of Canadian feminism better by  abandoning the search for unified positions  on the issues?  A larger question is, of course, whether  the focus on lobbying activities is, in fact,  the best use of NAC and its executive's energies. NAC old-timers remember that prior  to the '80s there was a much greater focus,  at least at the AGM, on the goal of educating and empowering women and women's  groups, whde lobbying played a less major  role.  The advantages of returning to this balance of functions are several:  • the outcome would be the development  of skUls at the grassroots level, as opposed to the concentration of skiU and  power in the hands of a few old pros, usuaUy from central Canada and particularly  from Toronto  • member groups could speak for themselves more often, which would strengthen the regional expression of feminist  concerns, make it easier to air a diversity  of viewpoints, and lessen the tendency of  the media to call upon NAC for a monolithic and sometimes over-simplified response to any issue, which would ultimately result in  See NAC pg. 16  KINESIS     ADril89        ~ Mozambique from pg. 11  Singing and dancing are common wherever  we are. It affirms our identity and our personality. This is what we've been trying to  do. Making culture is something that is not  only there to keep our identity but to affirm  struggle and resistance in Mozambique.  What can Canada and friends in the West  do? You can broaden and enlarge numbers  of people who know what's going on. Sometimes people know something about South  Africa but not enough about the Frontline  States, and in this case about Mozambique.  Knowledge wUl bring awareness. This wUl  lead to action. It's important that what  we are budding should be strengthened by  international soUdarity. EspeciaUy in areas  that we priorize, hke agriculture. It can  graduaUy reduce our dependence on international food aid. We also need support to  rebuUd infrastructures—schools, hospitals,  health centres ...  Of course it is also possible to put more  pressure where decisions are made, where  it is possible to accelerate the downfaU of  apartheid. We need to buUd a large front in  the world. That's why I'm here.  The Canadian government has given support to our efforts of development. Canada  is supporting projects within the SADCC  countries. Non-governmental organizations  and COCAMO (see below) give a lot of priority to rural development. This is good...  rebuUding roads, health centres, helping to  train. But what is still of a small dimension  is bdateral projects—direct government-to-  government assistance in agriculture, Ashing and mining, etc ... Pohtical statements  have to be foUowed by economic pressure.  Sanctions wUl help dismantle apartheid. We  expect the government of Canada to implement this.  We are victorious! The picture of Mozambique in the world is that of chUdren with  big beUies, displaced people. I am saying  that we axe people struggling for independence and our right to stand as equals in  the community of nations. RENAMO has  managed to destabilize the country through  guerriUa warfare. However, the mere fact  that they started after our independence, it  is now fourteen years, and that they have  not overthrown the government, shows our  victory.  The simple fact that we are stiU The People's Repubhc of Mozambique from north  to south, from east to west, means that we  are victorious. We are stUl there, a people  united and strongly identified, you know,  with the government and the party. We are  not only suffering, we are also a struggling  people and we resist strongly.  Graca Machel's visit was sponsored  by the World University Service of  Canada (WUSC).  The NFB film that accompanied  her presentation, "Mozambique: Riding  Out the Storm," was funded by WUSC  and COCAMO  (Cooperation Canada  Mozambique), a Canadian based consortium of about 20 non-governmental  development agencies. COCAMO is  raising funds for education projects  in Mozambique as well as educating  the Canadian public. COCAMO can  be contacted at (613) 236-4547 or 1  Nicholas St., Suite 300, Ottawa, Ont.

Graphics and statistics are available from the New Internationalist No.  192, Feb. 1989, and "Mozambique-  Apartheid 's Second Front," a resource  kit produced by COCAMO (available at  OXFAM).  WAR  Since the war started in 1982 its costs have been ...  Human:  •100,000 lives—as a direct result of Renamo activity.  •100,000 more in the famine of 1983-4 which was caused by a combination of  drought and war.  •25 percent of the population forced to become refugees.  •One Mozambican child dies every four minutes.  •400 teachers assassinated, kidnapped or mutilated.  Material:  •$6,000 million—twice the country's foreign debt and 60 times the value of  1987 exports.  •31 percent of health posts destroyed with a loss of health care to 2 million  people.  •36 percent of schools destroyed or forced to close, causing a 25 percent fall  in school attendance.  •1,300 trucks, tractors and buses, 164 locomotives, 352 wagons destroyed.  But there are signs of hope ...  Amnesty: During 1988 the Mozambican government offered an amnesty to Renamo guerrillas. Around 2,000 (of an estimated force of 20,000) accepted it.  Victories: Large parts of Renamo-held territory, especially in Zambesia  province, were recaptured by government forces aided by Tanzanian and Zimbabwean soldiers in 1988.  NAC from pg. 15  • a  more  powerful  grassroots  women's  movement which could be heard by federal politicians at the local level, instead  of just at the national level.  The disadvantage is that there would be  some loss of power for NAC at the national  level, a disadvantage which must be weighed  against the overaU goals of the organization.  So a second question is: Should NAC focus less on lobbying and more on education and empowering women and women's  groups?  Another question about process has to  do with size. Is there a limit on the size of  group which can function with feminist process and aUow room for diversity and differences? Certainly, an AGM which adopts a  process aUowing for every one of the hundreds of participants to express her views  about any resolution and be hstened to is  hard to imagine.  An obvious strategy long used by group  facilitators is to break any large group down  into groups smaU enough to aUow for real  discussion. The views of each smaU group  can be reflected by group representatives  who meet in turn in other smaU groups,  and so on, so that any action that develops  arises from a multi-faceted base expressive  of the Ml range of individual experience,  rather than from one imposed by strong-  arm tactics in a disempowering AGM that  exploits Robert's Rules. A strengthened regional structure could result from the operation of the same process.  In sum the question here is: Can the use  of a different process aUow NAC to benefit  from its size and diversity?  FinaUy, there is the question of the AGM  and what its function should be. From an  earlier form, when it functioned primarily  as an educating and empowering experience  for representatives of NAC member groups  from across the country, it has evolved into  a hideous marathon the goal of which is to  hammer out resolutions and unified positions, frequently in reaction to government  agendas. The focus on gaining media attention brings even greater pressure to stifle  real discussion.  The need to achieve these goals has  made the meeting into an experience which  most women find disappointing at best  and painfuUy alienating at worst. First-time  attendees—50 percent of aU participants—  arrive with high expectations at what  should be an energizing and transforming feminist experience and instead, disenfranchised by mysterious and dehumanizing  rules that preclude meaningful participation, leave angry and disappointed. The opportunity to get a sense of the breadth and  diversity of Canadian feminism is lost. In  fact the membership has no real role in setting the next year's agenda, since it is in the  hands of those who can play by the rules. It  is a sad pretense to claim that NAC's annual  meeting is in any way a feminist meeting.  Why not focus instead on ways of recognizing the strength and knowledge and  experience that each woman brings as the  amazing resource it is, as a resource which  can give each of us revitalized ideas and understanding and energy?  Can we use NAC's annual meeting to expand our understanding of feminism and  women's experience and thought, not to  narrow it?  Since we tend to accept that it is time  pressures that often justify our abandoning  feminist process, perhaps it is also time to  reconsider the assumption that feminist pohtical action wUl have no impact unless it  takes place at the very moment when the issue catches media or pohtical attention. We  need to appraise whether in acting swiftly  and ignoring feminist process we have accomplished so very much. Many of our gains  are in retrospect minor, temporary, or questionable, as the legislative initiatives regarding pornography have made only too clear.  We might have to move on to quantifying  instead what we have lost by ignoring feminist process. It is hard to find a committed  feminist these days who is not at least a httle dismayed by the prevalence of burnout,  by the refusal to engage or stay engaged in  the femimst enterprise, and, perhaps most  distressing of aU, by our faUure to attract  young women to the movement in significant numbers.  Something we might consider is abandoning the task orientation of the femimst  movement altogether, in favour of a process orientation. The feminist revolution is  in the way each of us hves her hfe, and that  revolution is now. Nothing could be more  revolutionary than doing aU our feminist  work using feminist process. H we choose  our agenda in terms of what we can do using that process, rather than having it chosen for us by the patriarchy, who's to say  we wouldn't be further ahead in 20 years?  So our last question is: Why not make  feminist process into the focus of the feminist revolution?

According to CAFB Chairman Gerard Kennedy, the objective of Hungerwatch  is to "serve as a catalyst for communities  and governments to understand and act on  of 1988. Statistics Canada places the rate at  9.9 percent for February 1989, down from  10.6 percent last summer.  There is a real problem, however, with using numbers to measure poverty. Numbers  can conceal as much as they reveal, especiaUy since unemployment figures consider  only those who are registered with employment centres. Governments are too apt to  point to economic indicators of prosperity  rather than to focus any attention on the  growth of poverty in Canada.  the underlying factors responsible for acute  poverty" in Canada.  During March 1989, aU emergency food  services across Canada wUl keep records  about the number of people who must rely  upon emergency food services for their survival. CaUed Hunger Count, this effort wUl  serve as the basis for public education campaigns regarding the problem of hunger in  Canada. It is hoped that over the next year  this "head count on hunger" wUl result in  community efforts to reduce the numbers of  those who go hungry in Canada by "as much  as 50 percent."  Such advocacy by the CAFB may not  have a stunning effect over so short a time,  but it wUl add fuel to other fires ht by anti-  poverty groups. Here in British Columbia,  communities hke Vancouver, Burnaby, Surrey, Nanaimo and Kamloops are organizing forums on hunger for AprU and later  on this year. Some are focussing on the issue of chUdren who come to school hungry,  a volatile subject in a province whose premier has stated that these chUdren's parents  do not care enough to send them to school  with a decent breakfast.  The Socred government wUl not contribute to hot lunches for school chUdren  untU educators have identified the chUdren  who are going hungry, a pre-condition which  is considered by many parents and teachers  to be unacceptable. Many parents on social  assistance fear that divulging such information wUl result in losing custody of their  chUdren.  The Attitude Problem  Feeding poor people is an immediate  problem. Related to this problem is the  larger one of social attitudes towards poor  people—that those who are unemployed or  hungry are jobless and starving because of  some fault of their own.  It is a popular misconception that unemployment in B.C. is on the decline, that  the worst of the hard times are over. Some  sectors of the economy are thriving—such  as the real estate market and land development projects, for example. The result is that unemployment in Vancouver is  marginally less than it was in the summer  For a certain class of people, things in  Vancouver are going very well, with houses  bought, sold/resold or demolished by developers at a great pace. Shelter costs, however, in a city which already suffers from  a low vacancy rate, are skyrocketing. For  those on fixed incomes, increasing shelter  costs means that even less money can be  spared for the purchase of food. High rents  inevitably lead to homelessness, at least for  some.  That, says the Vancouver Food Bank's  Sylvia RusseU, is intolerable. The Food  Bank has successfuUy asked Vancouver  Mayor Gordon CampbeU to proclaim AprU  10-16 as "Local Hunger Awareness Week."  "During this week," said RusseU, "we are  appealing to residents of Vancouver, Burnaby and the North Shore to initiate food or  fundraising drives for people who go hungry  in these communities. So far, we have approached some sports and service organizations, businesses, educational institutions,  labour unions and other concerned groups  to direct their energies towards aUeviating  the problem of hunger in the Lower Mainland during the Awareness Week."  "In Vancouver, and across Canada, we  must not lose sight of the fact that social  programs to assist the poor are totally inadequate. Our greatest chaUenge today is to  completely eradicate poverty."  Donations Down  It is a challenge which the Vancouver Food  Bank has met with increasing difficulty over  the last few years. The Food Bank currently distributes over 90,000 bags of groceries a year, with an estimated value of  $1,512,000, through eight depots in the Vancouver, Burnaby and North Shore area. Of  those who receive assistance, over 88.14 percent are on welfare with an additional 3.58  percent receiving unemployment benefits.  Another 4.78 percent are on disabUity or old  age pensions and 2.88 percent report no income of any sort. Only .62 percent are employed, either full or part-time.  MeanwhUe, as the economy appears to  improve, donations to the Vancouver Food  Bank are down—by about 12 percent in  each of the last three years. Many in B.C.  and in Canada as a whole beheve that there  are aU kinds of jobs for people who want  to work. Being a chef or a cook, a waiter/  waitress, teUer, service station attendant or  sales clerk may not be glamorous, they say,  but they do provide people with the dignity  of paying their own way in the world.  At present, there is a decline even in  the avaUability of these jobs, which pay  the worker lower wages and which are considered by employers to be more expendable jobs. Included in this sector are jobs  in the manufacturing trade, hke the garment and textde industry, which are traditionally fiUed by women and immigrant  labour. These groups are often the object of hidden—and not so hidden—sexual  and racial discrimination which is often expressed as wage inequities. As weU, employment gains in services, transportation, manufacturing, construction, the retaU trade  and tourism are often poorly paid and undervalued.  In B.C., employment fluctuations are  caused by the fact that the province's economy is resource-based. Resource industries  are influenced by the demands of the world  market and subject employees to seasonal  layoffs according to whether or not a particular resource is in short or heavy demand.  The food lines contain many of the resource-  based unemployed.  Other factors affect the Canadian work  force as a whole, such as a high level of  job dislocation resulting from technological  changes. Even in the clerical sector, once  thought to be an unending source of jobs,  women are being replaced by computerization. Part-time employment is on the increase, but part-time employees do not have  J^MtM  W*&,  NEW!

Part-time workers are also  the first ones to be laid off when a company "downsizes." The question to be asked  is whether women can exist on part-tune  salaries since their pay cheques are often essential to the survival of their families.  Challenging Stereotypes  The biggest single challenge to food banks  and emergency food services across Canada  continues to be the stereotype of the "welfare bum," led to poverty by nothing more  than alcohol or drug abuse, emotional and  mental problems. Some women on welfare  are considered to be promiscuous or irresponsible parents. It is certainly true that  for some, poverty can lead to addiction, to  criminal acts or mental breakdown. It is also  true that many of the poor have an astonishing abihty to make too few doUars go  farther than other Canadians could stretch  them.  For "communities and governments to  act on the underlying factors responsible for  acute poverty," a lot wUl have to change in  people's attitudes towards poor people, and  in their acceptance of poverty. Poor people  wUl be with us so long as we blame them  for being impoverished.

The location could not have been more perfect and  the fire pit in the centre of the lodge burned  brightly from noon till night. ChUdren—  some with exquisitely painted faces—and  women sat around the fire, some deep in  contemplation, others amicably visiting and  eating.  There was something for everyone: workshops ranging from chanting to art therapy, to a workshop on Healing the ChUd  Within; and, in the day-care there was  singing with the kids, clowning and other  good things. Two healing rooms were created, one for body-work: Reike, Trager and  Rosen-method massage, Shiatsu. Healers  and psychics were kept busy in the second  room with women consulting chaneUers,  tarot-card readers, astrologers, and choosing healing flower essences.  Because aU the healers charged by donation it was easy to access different healing  techniques. As weU, crystals, stones, jewelry, shirts and divers kinds of magick items  were for sale.

ChUdren and womoon, (WMHVS literature uses the latter speUing as weU as  womyn/women) talked, laughed, touched  and healed one another. Healers and the  healed sat around the sacred fire- pit in the  evening enjoying a variety of singers and poets.

I was curious about the work of the  group, but too busy to get to yet another  meeting.  WeU.

Some of the services the Waxing Moon  ViUage wiU include: a safe and supportive space for womyn in transition and in  need of healing; an alternative home base  for aging and differently abled womyn; retreats; workshops; international networking; a moon lodge; organic gardens; and  practical considerations: job training programs to provide education opportunities  for women, which teach rural skills, ecological awareness, energy conservation.  UntU the money or land womynfests, the  WMHVS is looking for interim land "to  hold workshops and retreats, thus budding our support and skUls." H this weU-  organized healing fair is an example of the  WMHVS' work there is no doubt they wUl,  indeed, find the perfect spot of land, creating a healing oasis. For aU of us. In  the meantime, hopefuUy the Waxing Moon  Healing Village Society wUl hold regular  healing fairs.  The Native Education Centre, with its  high ceilings, cathedral glass windows and  central fire-pit made some of us feel as if  we were already there, sitting in an outside courtyard in a womyn's healing vUlage!  I went for a couple of hours only to find  myself speUbound by the event and stayed  late into the night. There was talk among  some women that there was a healing of another sort happening at the fair: a coming  together of the pohtical and the spiritual.  Utopia indeed.  For those too busy to be directly involved, the WMHVS encourages interested women to take out a membership.  Cost is on a sliding scale: $50-30, more  or less, depending on your finances.  Their publication, Waxing Moon News is  available for $12 a year.

These are just a few of the women who  wiU be sharing their divers talents with audiences and participants during the second  annual MayWorks Festival, running from  Monday, May 1 to Sunday, May 7.  The newspaperwomen who also sing are  the Images Ad Hoc Singers, formed seven or  eight years ago by women who put out Im-  Running about 45 minutes, with some costumes and simple sets, "Mavis ..." was a  big hit at the Women In View festival earlier this year. It tells the story of two sisters who work as bus drivers, and is hdari-  ous in true Nora Randall fashion. This play  wUl also be part of a new facet of the May-  Works Festival—Art in the Workplace.  This program wUl take performances and  visual art to lunchrooms and dockyards, affirming the phUosophy of connection between artists and workers that is the basis  of the festival. As part of this effort, Ran-  ages, the women's paper from Nelson, B.C.  "We're not in it for performance," said Bonnie Evans, talking about how they practise  every Tuesday night whether or not they  have a gig coming up. "In fact, some of us  prefer it when we don't have a performance  to prepare for, because we spend more time  working on new songs. We're reaUy slow to  learn, so if we have a lot of performances  we end up polishing old material instead of  learning new stuff. Others in the group love  to perform."  Those women should be happier these  days because Images Ad Hoc Singers have  gained a reputation, and are being caUed  upon more and more. They'd be singing  at the Anza club during MayWorks, sharing a bid with Nora RandaU's play, "Mavis  TeUs the Story of Marlene and the Chicken  Yard."  RandaU is the writer who also acts, transforming her story into a performance piece  with the help of director Jackie Crossland.  daU wUl take "Mavis ... " to the Kenmar  (a bus company) lunchroom, for the benefit  of the staff.  As weU as taking theatre into the workplace, MayWorks wUl also be taking the  workplace into the theatre. Readings and  shows of work-related writing, visual art  and video are too numerous to hst, but one  very interesting event is a theatre piece to  be developed (in five days!) by clerical workers with the help of Headlines Theatre Company, caUed "Not Just Nine to Five: Surviving the Modern Office" (see page 20 this issue).  As for the poet who also dances, Ah-  dri Zhina Mandiela is a Jamaican-born Toronto based dub poet, who is also involved  very much with theatre and dance. "Sometimes I work with a band," she said, "but  this time I'U be solo. What 111 be doing for  MayWorks wiU be poetry, but with a lot of  movement and melody as weU. It's mostly  Melvin remembered  by Jill Pollack  When she died in 1977, Grace Melvin requested there be no funeral or memorial service. As her nephew said, "She wanted to be  remembered by her work."  Not only has she been forgotten, but her  other last 'wish' has also faUen by the wayside. It was her intention that Ulumination  and lettering become accepted as popular  contemporary art forms. Her words were, "I  resolved ... to pioneer the revival of Ulumination."  Her sights may have been unrealistic. Yet  Grace Melvin does deserve to be remembered, if only for her work at the Vancouver  School of Decorative and Apphed Arts (VS-  DAA), now the Emdy Carr CoUege of Art  and Design, and for her coUaborations with  Marius Barbeau.  Grace Melvin was born in Scotland. During the late 1920's, she studied at the Glasgow School of Art. It was then that she first  discovered a coUection of lettered and Ulu-  minated manuscripts in the library of the  British Museum. She had an immediate reaction to them, and was to devote a large  part of her hfe to practicing this art form.  Grace's brother-in-law was Charles H.  Scott, the first principal of the VSDAA. In  1927, he asked her to come to Vancouver on  a one year's leave of absence to help set up  the school's design department. She went on  to become its head, untd her retirement in  1952.  Grace Melvin had a lot of strong opinions. She found that most modern Ulumi-  nators (there were some) were "too fond of  ornamentation." She beheved the art had  "reached its zenith in the 13th century, and  that the long-forgotten masters were better craftsmen than their foUowers today."  So in 1930, she published Basic Lettering  for Art Students. Even in 1977, it was stiU  the main text used for this subject.  Melvin also had much to say about her  own profession. She said teaching was "  ... such fun ... that's why I never went  back to Glasgow. I stUl beheve in constructive teaching, drawing, design. After that is  the time for the artist to express his own  ideas. Few artists make a hving by selling  their paintings. They must teach or do commercial art. Teaching is undoubtedly the  best secondary occupation because a creative teacher can get something as weU as  giving.  a theatre package, issue-oriented with dramatic dehvery."  The issues she speaks about run the  gamut from feminism through imperialism,  poverty, pain, youth concerns, Native rights  and exploitation of the Third World—aU  from the perspective of a Black woman hving in Canada.  As weU as doing her own show at the  IWA hall cabaret, Mandiela is taking part  in a group reading at the Octopus bookstore, May 6, caUed "Telling It Like It Is:  Racism Doesn't Work." Including such poets as Jenny Gunn, Lee Maracle, Surjeet  Kalsey and Evelyn Lau, as weU as several  male poets, this event wUl focus on the experience of racism in the workplace.  Across the street at La Quena, on May  1, wUl be an aU-women reading of Working  Writers including Kate Braid, Zoe Lambert,  Kristen Emmott and more.  Selected Events  MAYWORKS OPENING SPLASH,  Mon.

Melvin supported government grants to  artists in order to sustain their growth.  "One can usuaUy spot real talent very early  in the development of an artist. An artist  can't afford to measure success in terms of  money or publicity," was how she put it in  1974.  Along with Uluminating manuscripts and  teaching, she also painted and did book  Ulustrations. In the 40's she focussed on  black and white pen and ink drawings. At  the same time, she traveUed around B.C.  and Alaska with the ethnologist, Marius  Barbeau. They collaborated on two books  about the Northwest Coast Indian culture  and lore. She made hundreds of drawings,  trying to " ... bring out the strong imaginative nature of the Indian of our coast."  Then in 1956, after one of many trips to  Hawaii, she won an award for her water-  colour, "Coral Reef—Morning Honolulu,"  at the second Winnipeg Art GaUery juried  show.  In 1972, Grace Melvin had a 50 year retrospective at the Vancouver Art GaUery. =  She had been trying to convince the GaUery J  to set aside space to " ... show more work s  by established local artists ... the public- J  ity is very important to the welfare of an £  artist." a  Her last years were spent hving alone in a £  cottage just off southwest Marine Drive. It  had been designed and budt by Charles H.  Scott, and "was almost hidden among big  trees." She painted every day: "As soon as  the breakfast dishes are done, it's into the  studio for two or three hours."  She had, she said, "A zest for hfe."  KINESIS >s*ssass****ss**sss*^^  ARTS  In Visible Colours: International buffet  by Terri Hamazaki  "There is an incredibly rich and varied  cultural diversity in Canada that needs to  be expressed," said organizers of In Visible  Colours, a local film and video festival to be  held November 15-19.  Aimed towards fostering pohtical, cultural, social, economic and gender awareness, this five-day, multi-venue event wiU  showcase works by women of colour and  Third World Women. An accompanying  symposium wUl address the surrounding issues of production, distribution and economics.  Within their respective roles as Distributor of Women's Programs and Distribution  Manager, Festival organizers Lorraine Chan  of the National Film Board (NFB) and  Zainub Verjee of Women in Focus (WIF)  were dismayed to discover the lack of films  that reflected the experiences of women of  aU cultures; films that reflected their own  reaUty.  The dialogue between the NFB and WIF  about the lack of film resources was joined  by voices from Immigrant Services and the  Vancouver Society on Immigrant Women,  and two years later, a dream has become a  reality.  The festival's title 'In Visible Colours,'  describes the invisibdity of the various cultural groups in North America, and the  need to assert their rights to have access to  the media. It also reflects the lack of representation in film of women of colour and  Third World women.  Explained Verjee, "Within the context of  imperialism and colonialism, there is a long  history of sdence; of not being represented."  The festival wUl attempt to address the relationship between the dominant (white) culture and other cultures, in addition to promoting the works of women of diverse cultural and pohtical perspectives.  A preliminary hst of film and video  makers reads hke an international buffet and confirms the organizers' desire to  look at representation from various cultural  groups. Here's a sampling taste from the  hst: Sumiko Haneda (Japan), "The Cherry  Tree With Grey Blossoms;" Vijaya Mehta  (India), "Rao Sahib;" Sara Gomez (Cuba),  "One Way or Another;" Heiny Srour (Middle East), "LeUa and the Wolves;" Sylvia  HamUton (Canada), "Black Mother, Black  Daughter."  Submissions are stUl being accepted and  are urgently requested; the only criteria for  Clerical work on stage  by Diane Strandberg  Stuck in poorly ventUated offices in  badly designed work stations, women clerical workers are plagued by a bewddering array of health problems.  But according to the Clerical Workers  Health and Safety Project, knowledge of the  issue is only half the battle. They want to  see women take positive action to change  their work environment, spokesperson Lois  Weninger says. "Because of the subtle nature of office hazards, office-related illnesses  atre idea is a good way of raising pubhc  awareness of office issues because it involves  women concerned about these hazards and  brings to hfe their experiences.  CaUed Not Just Nine to Five, Surviving the Modern Office, the play wiU also  encourage audience participation, offering a  unique opportunity for dialogue about this  crucial issue.  "We're excited about the show because  it gives clerical workers a chance to explore issues affecting their daily hves," says  Weninger. "We hope to get the message  often go unacknowledged. Clerical workers  suffer in sUence because they don't realize  their health problem is real; it's not just in  their heads."  Her group is working to raise awareness  and buUd a network of women interested in  solving this problem. One way of focusing  attention on the issue is to involve clerical  workers in a way that enables them to take  action.  On April 22, about 20 clerical workers wUl participate in a theatre event that  presents the issues in a unique way. Not only  wiU they act in the play, but they wUl write  and produce it.  They wiU work together with Headlines  Theatre, a popular local theatre company  that has buUt a reputation for producing so-  ciaUy relevant plays with community groups  throughout B.C. Weninger says the the-  across that the office environment can have  a direct impact on the quality of women's  hves. We're saying, 'Here's an opportunity  for women not only to talk about this issue  but to buUd an agenda for change.' "  Beginning at 8 pm, at the Vancouver  East Cultural Centre, Not Just Nine to  Five wdl also feature entertainment by special guests Aya, the Euphoniously Feminist Quintet, Helen Potrebenko and Sandy  Shreve. Tickets are $6 and can be ordered  through the VECC box office.

Suggested  themes for the work include: cinema resistance, cinema in exde, women's sexuahty,  land and development, and violence.  The need for cultural diversity and gender awareness in the cinematic world is  highly undervalued in our society. Tradi-  tionaUy, women have only participated as  'images' and the festival wUl "... also be  used as a vehicle for women of colour to see  themselves as producers of culture, to give  them a sense of empowerment," said Chan.  Added Verjee, "There are people who are  interested in producing community-based  videos, for example, but there's no money to  produce them, and even if there is, there's  no way to distribute them." Included in  the festival is a two-day symposium, led by  guest film and video makers, for those seeking information on the actual development  and distribution of works of film and video.  "Initial response to the festival has been  generaUy favourable; and hopefuUy, the  event will create an appetite and a demand  for films/videos of this kind," said Chan. In  Visible Colours is a cultural event, after aU,  stressed organizers.  However, plans are already underway  to buUd an educational, anti-racism pro  gramme, creating a catalogue of videos  which wUl be taken around to schools. "We  w- j to hold workshops for school chUdren,  to familiarize them with the equipment and  talk about cultural differences," said Verjee.  Continued Chan, "In Canada, what multiculturalism means is never reaUy discussed, and with a festival hke this, we are  able to pohticize one another."  Targeted towards feminists, film/art communities, ethnic groups and the general  public, the WD? and NFB co-sponsored festival has already received support from the  Vancouver Society on Immigrant Women,  the government of Norway, and the Canadian International Development Agency  (CIDA). And organizers hope for additional  support from other federal agencies.  Volunteers are also needed to help with  aU aspects of the festival. In Visible Colours  wUl be a celebration of cultural diversity,  promise festival organizers. You are strongly  urged to join in the festivities.

Rites best of Riches  by Eunice Brooks  RITES  by Brenda Riches  Erin, Ontario: Porcupine's QuUl, 1988  84 pages  Brenda Riches writes from the Doris  Lessing school of how-to foUowing the words  from The Golden Notebook: "One novel  in a thousand has the quahty a novel should  have to make it a novel—the quahty of philosophy."  Rites is a coUection of the best of Riches'  previously published short stories, 15 in aU.  Each of her tales has found a metaphor. In  "A SmaU Room," the opener, a man and a  woman are tangled in the sort of sleep that  comes after complete physical and mental  union. The woman dreams that she is wearing a green dress, and he has aUowed her  to lead him into mysteries known only to  women. Her journal has a green cover. His  being is the ink in her pen.  Rites is Riches' second book. Dry Media, 1980, was mostly poetry, but it is in  prose that Riches reaches her power as a  writer. Rites is in no way didactic or po  Utical. Rather it is a brilliantly conceived  coUection of strong characters, and long  on description that leaves one in no doubt  about the writer's vision. Perhaps comparing Riches to Virginia Woolf would not be  out of place. Although her word pictures are  perfect, she is far from verbose. Spare is a  better way of describing her stories.  "The Maid" is set in some time that is  not present or past, and some place that  is neither here nor there—precisely. The  plot is simple. An angel gets curious, and  God dumps her onto earth to hve. The  maid takes over the boddy needs of the  heavenly visitor. They both have a weakness for Chablis and I got a chuckle at the  homey wisdom of the interaction between  the women. Yes, angels are women. So is  God.  "Hannah's Day" is my favourite. Hannah  also hkes wine, and in the glass she finds  such truths as: "At rock bottom hfe is ineffable." Hannah writes, but she has more  strength than either Riches or me, since  Hannah commits each poem to memory,  then burns the paper it is written on. Hannah takes buses every day without noticing  destinations. She disembarks "lord knows  See Rites next page  AINESIS  April 89 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  ///////////////////^^^  LETTERS  More on  stripping  Kinesis:  It's great that Kinesis printed Joanne  P.'s commentary about lesbians supporting the striptease at the gay club. I also  feel disappointed that lesbians are exploiting women in this way.  I would hke to think that lesbians, with  our outsider view, our love of women,  would be outraged at this objectification of  women's bodies (and it's always bodies that  fit the heterosexual standard—not fat, old,  scarred, or too damn butchy).  I would hke to think that as lesbians  we are creating our own sexuahty—not just  copying the hets. Striptease has nothing to  do with being "hberated" about sex—it is  completely confined within the male imagination of sex.  I want to be treated better, and to treat  other women better, than men treat us. So  don't be totaUy disdlusioned, Joanne: there  are dykes that share your point of view.  Bonnie Waterstone  Health  fund  Kinesis:  A point of clarification regarding Jackie  Brown's article on the Women's Health  Fund (Kinesis, March '89, p. 5):  In describing the origins of the Health  Fund Jackie refers to the particular situation of Barb Hayman, a WAVAW staff  worker who at the time of her Ulness "had  not been at WAVAW long enough to qualify  for disabUity benefits." It should be noted  that the requirement of a qualifying period  was not WAVAW's but the insurance company's. For readers unfamiliar with such  matters, qualifying periods of three to six  Rites from pg. 20  where" to have adventures. "Once she went  into a bar and ordered three strawberry  daiquiris, thus breaking the alcoholic regime  of a lifetime." Hannah writes vUlaneUes, a  form of poetry I first learned about by reading the biography of Sylvia Plath. I've tried  them, and that ties me to Hannah. Someday I may even be her.  An example of Riches' strong description  hes in "Trappings." She writes: A gentleman sat in an elegant chair. His left leg  was stretched out in front of him; his  right leg bent, the foot pressing into rich  rug. He held his hand against the side  of his face, the forefinger slowly tapping a thoughtful upper lip. Though he  leaned slightly away from the lady, his  head was tilted in concern for her wilful words which gusted through him like  wind through a cold chimney.  She reaUy takes me there. This piece is  more a fragment than a story.  The same could be said of "The Concert Master." One hne stands out: "The violin strings turn into worms that wriggle  and multiply." Then later: "Notes fly out,  shocked birds, blundering against windows,  dropping feathers."  Rites cannot be classified as feminist, exactly, nor can it be caUed Canadian literature, exactly. It can be called weU written without stretching truth, and interesting too. It isn't the book for someone looking for serious answers to social problems,  or to finding a better way to pay the rent. I  wUl be surprised if it goes to second printing, but I treasure my copy, have read it several times, and can recommend it to those  of you who are tired of MarUyn French and  Germaine Greer for the nonce.  months are standard in the insurance industry. The employer, in this case WAVAW,  does not have the power to set or waive the  requirement; control rests with the insurer.  WAVAW as an organization was tremendously supportive of Barb during her Ulness.  In addition, individuals within WAVAW  gave unreservedly of their time, effort and  money assisting in the various fund-raising  activities on Barb's behalf.  As an update to Jackie's story, we are  very excited at the successful launching of  the Women's Health Fund. Response from  the community has been great. Of course,  many hands and many doUars are needed.  Readers wishing to make a donation or to  get involved in the Fund can contact us  c/o 101-2245 W. Broadway, Vancouver V6K  2E4.  For the Women's Health Fund,  Lisa S. Price  Clarifying  criticism  Kinesis:  Dear Betsy Warland, et al.  After I sent off the response to J.  Lochrie's review of (f.)Lip, I realize that  I'd left room for misinterpretation. My criticism was not directed at (f.)Lip so much  as at the perspective of the review.  I understand the role (f.)Lip is trying  to fulfill and the need for that voice among  many. I was objecting to a review that accepts the style of ecriture feminine as a  valid form of expression and change and  yet denies the possibility of difference on  the level of actual language. I interpret this  as a privUeging of a certain style over a  m—~"~~—~~~~  —  LLLftfLL  broader—again no pun intended—issue of  content within context.  Perhaps my point was simply that there  is an impUcit hierarchy of identities (and  possibly even of class) that is created when  ecriture feminine is canonized and French  writing is criticized in the same breath. Particularly under the banner of 'accessibility.'  Sincerely,  Karen Herland  Adoption  guidance  Kinesis:  I'm writing because I've just finished  reading Cyndi MeUon's article on the kidnapping of Guatemalan chUdren for adoption. As someone who is now in the process  of adopting a chUd from another country, I  want to say that not aU international adoptions are Ulegal. The chUd I hope to bring  home with me is now five years old, and has  spent most of her hfe in an institution. I  cannot see any way it would be doing her a  service to leave her there.  Many of the women I have met who have  adopted or are trying to adopt internation-  aUy are women on their own who, for aU  practical purposes, would not be eligible to  adopt in British Columbia because they do  not have husbands. They are very concerned  that they are proceeding in both an ethical  and a legal manner.  If Cyndi Mellon or the Christian Task  Force on Central America can pass on any  guidelines for avoiding Ulegal adoptions, or  can expose the names of groups or individuals who are dealing in chUdren for profit,  I would hke to give that information to  the Adoptive Parents Association of British  Columbia to print in their newsletter.

This  workshop will explore the ways in which  the escalation of commitment, of energy,  of time, of skills is an inevitable part of  living political lives. How do women handle the constantly shifting relationships  of their private and public lives when  their life is a politically based one? How  do we know when it's time to shift to  taking care of ourselves instead of others? This workshop will combine political  theory and analysis, personal exploration,  group process and discussion to describe  and connect the many-layered landscape  in which we live. Sandra Butler is an internationally recognized authority on issues of child abuse and violence against  women. She is best known for her pioneering book: Conspiracy of Silence: The  Trauma of Incest. Sandra has over the  years developed unique therapeutic techniques that explore the relationship between creativity, community and healing.
