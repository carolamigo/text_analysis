"^  Nov 79 50*  KIM£JIJ  news about women that's not in the dailies  n £• 5*  SsS  N& Working women united for energizing conference October 14  The Working Women's Conference,   held  Sunday October 14,   was a tremendous  success.  It attracted more than 300 women, many  of whom were new to the women's movement.  Diverse workshops were rich in hard facts  and fresh insights. Working Women Unite,  and BCFW, the groups which organized the  Conference with cooperation from Women 's  Studies and Continuing Education at  Langara campus,  must be delighted.  Workshops ranged from discussion of basic  labour standards in B. C.   through fighting  for quality childcare  to assertiveness  training.     Instead of providing a routine  report on all the workshops,  KINESIS has  decided to focus on a few issues raised  at the conference.  Supporting each  other in our non-  traditional jobs  Janet Beebe  More than 30 women attended this energizing workshop. About half of the women  were unemployed or doing clerical work,  but interested in non-traditional work.  The rest were already in non-traditional  jobs, representing carpenters, shipwrights,  printers, welders, bus and truck drivers,  seawomen, electricians and mill worker's,  among other trades.  The workshop included  a panel of four tradeswomen, well-chosen,  for they had interesting stories to tell.  Discussion after the panel included a  proposal to set up a Women in Trades  Association (see end of story for details).  Defining non-traditional work can be a  nebulous pursuit.  It can refer to work  that is not an extension of women's traditional work in the home, or be restricted to work in the "primary" sector of the  economy, for example, but essentially it  means work that pays well and is usually  'men's work'.  The definition is complicated for a num  ber of historical reasons.  One is that  some - even most - women, have always  done "non-traditional" work, only it has  been treated as invisible.  Consider farm  women, who still work alongside their  husbands in the fields,'before retiring  to cook supper and do housework.  Early trade guild's excluded women, which  did not prevent them from learning trade  skills, as wives and daughters, only  from achieving status and pay for their  work. Many women carried on family businesses after the death of the tradesman.  One panelist pointed out that one-quarter  of U.S. printers in the seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries were women.  Another important' factor is the evolution  of jobs which often leads to the formation  of female job ghettoes, as happened with  teaching and clerical work at the beginning of this century. When men leave an  occupation, both status and pay drop.  Such is "tradition".  And once women are forced into job ghettoes, we become a cheap, exploitable  labour pool which can be used by business  managers and owners to undermine male  workers demands for better wages and working conditions.  Women who work at non-traditional jobs  usually do so first out of economic necessity, and the pay, for the most part,  is good.  Other benefits are respect for  the work you do; often a concrete product  to take pride in; in many jobs - at last -  "the chance to look like a slob and act  surly"; a sense of physical well-being  camaraderie with co-workers; and not  least, the pleasure of breaking ground  anew for women, although as one woman  observed, the novelty "quickly wears  off".  Which leads to some of the problems women inevitably encounter in non-traditional work. The biggest has to be the  isolation and loneliness a woman can feel  when she is the only, or one of a few,  women on a job site.  One woman nearing  completion of an electrical apprentice  ship said she had never seen another  woman on a jobsite, and as far as she  knows she is the only woman in her union  of some 3,000 members,  (significantly,  she feels that when layoffs occur, it is  the "older guys, alcoholics, union activists, and me" who are laid off first  every time.  There is no discrimination  clause in her union contract.)  A second problem is simply, conspicuous-  ness. Women often find themselves constantly watched, unfortunabely, especially at first-when self-confidence is  apt to be lowest.  Another problem area involves the "double  binds" we work with, such as: working  hard to prove yourself, and being both  exploited and resented for that willingness: landing a "soft" job only because  the foreman thinks you can't handle other  work, and being resented by co-workers  for it: having men "help" you with your  work, then being resented for not pulling  your share...see the pattern? As one  woman so aptly put it, women in "men's  jobs" are "with the boys, but not of the  boys: of the girls, but not with them."  'Many problems women face in non-traditional work are in fact men's own difficulties in working with women.  Women at the workshop had other observations about working in non-traditional  jobs:  * The fact that there is no precedent for  your presence may be an advantage, but  the stereotyping you wil] face can be  deadly, if assumptions are made that put  you in a rut you can't get out of.  * There is a thin line between being  "traditionally" accommodating and just  plain hard to work with. All new workers  face a testing period of sorts, but for  women new to non-traditional jobs, this  can mean prolonged harassment.  * Men and women appear to have different  work and learning habits.  One woman,  for instance, said she learned not to  ask too many questions, but to learn  instead by watching other workers.

This year's planning committee, FLAG,  says that the focus of the convention  will be on action.  On the Friday evening, there will a  wine and cheese party at the community  centre. This will give people an opportunity to make contact and to exchange  information.  Saturday morning is taken up with reports from the 1978 BCFW committees,  and workshops are scheduled for the  afternoon on topics ranging from feminists in the arts to abortion, unemployment, and prison workshops.  A women's dance, open to all interested  women, is planned for the Saturday evening.*  Judges are pressing  charges once again  Local judges are again convicting prostitutes of soliciting. Within a two-week  period, three prostitutes were found  guilty of "pressing and persistent" conduct.  Judge Kerry Smith refused to enforce a  curfew requested by a crown prosecutor  against one of the prostitutes. Judge  Smith said that soliciting is a minor  offense  and that curfews were inappropriate except in exceptional cases.9  A womanvision commentary  George Pappajohn honestly believed he had  the woman's consent, his lawyer told the  Supreme Court October 22nd.  The Court, which has now heard Pappajohn's  final appeal, has reserved decision.  An affluent Vancouver businessman, Pappajohn has been convicted by lower courts  of raping a woman in August 1976. Melonie  Edwards, a realtor, testified that she had  been raped four or five times, finally  tying her hands behind her back and gagging  her with a bow tie.  She said that her  unwillingness, had, in Pappajohn's opinion  "made it more interesting".  She escaped from the house, naked and  still bound and with the gag around her  neck.  Pappajohn claims that she put up only    ,  token protests.  The trial judge commented  that, although honest belief might be an  element in some cases, it did not arise  in the Pappajohn case.  Therefore he did not instruct the jury  that Pappajohn could be deemed innocent  if he had honestly believed that there was  consent.  British Columbia's Court of Appeal concurred with the trial judge, and upheld  the sentence of three years in jail.  Appearing for Pappajohn, who has been out  on bail all along, Douglas Brown argued  before the Supreme Court that "the mental  element in the crime of rape is the intention of the accused to have sexual intercourse without the complainant's consent.  When an accused acts under a mistaken belief as to the fact of consent, he lacks  the necessary mens rea (guilty intention)"  Supreme Court Justice Ronald Martland remarked that the defence of honest belief  would not hold up if intercourse had  taken place with the woman bound and  John Hall, appearing for the Prosecution,  said that the defence of honest belief  might exist in a few cases, but that  Pappahohn's was not one of them.  Under the Criminal Code of Canada, the  victim's lack of consent is still considered to be the major issue in rape  trials.  It is the only type of assault  which focusses primarily on the element  of consent.  Similarily, actual penetration is seen as being a determining factor in deciding whether or not rape has  taken place.  Pending the result of the Supreme Court  hearing, Edwards will be bringing a civil  suit against Pappajohn. He has a counter-  suit in the works.  When the Supreme Court hands down its  judgement, we'll carry the details.*  Wives will be able to charge husbands with rape  Wives will be able to charge their husbands  with rape under Conservative amendments to  the Criminal Code, coming up this parliamentary session.  Justice Minister Jacques Flynn says that  the Tories concur with earlier Liberal  amendments which defined rape as "sexual  assault". But the Conservatives propose  to take these changes further.  Under the former Liberal proposal, a wife  could only charge a husband with' "indecent  assault" if she was living apart from him  when he raped her.  The Canadian Law Reform Commission has been  advocating the removal of the "spousal  exemption" in cases of sexual assault,  and Flynn agrees.  He intends to promote legislation which  will extend the possibility of an "indecent assault" charge to cases where husbands and wives are living together.  He's got a sense of humour, this Flynn.  Says that "it will work both ways", adding with a grin that the law is not just  for the protection of the wives   New Democrat justice critic Fonse Faour,  applauded Flynn's plan, but Liberal MPs  are disgruntled.  "I fear it would encourage family conflict," says Mark MacGuigan, Liberal critic  of the solicitor-general.  If these proposals are adopted, former-  solicitor general Jean Jacques Blais fears,  "the criminal courts could become tribunals for domestic squabbles and family  differences".*  Nova Scotians deliver fetus into anti-choice hands  Brooke Forbes  Nova Scotia was the setting for a pretty  startling decision a couple of weeks ago  when a family court awarded custody of  an unborn fetus to a "pro-life" group.  An 18 year old pregnant woman, separated  from her husband, who is 19, applied to  Victoria General Hospital in Halifax to  have a therapeutic abortion.  Her husband, in an effort to prevent.the  abortion, went to a lawyer to try to  stop her.  He chose staunch "pro-lifer" Ted Moyer,  who applied to family court to have the  unborn child placed under the guardianship of a "pro-life" group.  His argument was based on the Provincial  Services Act's definition of a child  which, in Nova Scotia, is "a boy or girl  under 16."  The lawyer argued that the fetus fell into  that category and deserved the same rights  that a child would have.  His argument obviously was convincing because the family court judge Ray Bartlett  accepted it and granted custody of the  fetus to the group.  The case was held ex parte. This means that  the part involved, the pregnant woman, was  unaware of it until after the decision had  been handed down.  In fact, she only learned of the matter  after a local radio station tried to contact her to get some sort of comment.  After this decision was handed down, the  hospital's therapeutic abortion team refused to perform the abortion.  Faced with a law suit, it must have felt  it wasn't prepared to go through with it.  Once a ruling like this is made, it can  be used in other judgements. But family  court specialist, Arthur Foote, of "Dal-  housie University Law School, claimed that  because the family court was an inferior  court, it would not really amount to an  effective precedent.  On the other hand, if it may not be a binding one, it is a persuasive one. Taken to  its extreme, it would preclude almost any  kind of abortion.  Last year, in the English Supreme Court,  a judgement was delivered in which the  judge said they would never accord guardianship to a fetus. But in this case the  court has decided that the fetus is a person.  Not long ago, in the Supreme Court in  Ontario a judge, faced with an almost identical situation, refused the "pro-life"  plea. Because that was a higher court  decision, it has more impact.  The woman's lawyer is considering suing  the hospital and the abortion team for  support of the child because they changed  their mind over a three-day period.  The group, Nova Scotians United for Life,  have said that their intention was to  stop the abortion, not to gain guardianship in order to be parents.  The lawyers can argue back and forth in  higher and lower courts....  But think of the mother in this case.  She's 18. She's separated from her husband. She's past the stage when an abortion would have been safe. So she's awaiting the birth of her second child. She  already has a 19 month-old baby. She's  on welfare and she's living, trying very  hard to remain anonymous, in a small  village in Nova Scotia.  I wonder what's ahead for her?* Kinesis November '79 3  PERSONS DAY  Pomp and impoverished circumstances on our anniversary  Persons' Day, October 18.  The governor-general shows up at Rideau  Hall on Persons' Eve to bestow upon seven  women the first Persons' Awards.  One B.C. award-winner is Grace Mclnnis.  From 1965 to 1974, as the NDP member for  Vancouver-Kingsway, Mclnnis battled for  women's rights in the House of Commons.  The other B.C. winner is Eileen Tallman-  Sufrin, a labour organizer from White Rock.  Other recipients of awards include Mary  Two-Axe Early, of Caughnawaga, Quebec, and  Sophia Dixon, a former president of the  United Farm Women in Saskatchewan.  At Vancouver Status of Women, we celebrate  by throwing a press conference.  As our spokesperson for the day, Debra  Lewis says:  If we are expected to celebrate our status  as persons,   then we must have assurance  that we will gain the position of being  equal persons,  and that we are entitled to  a standard of living that will allow us  to live with a real level of security and  dignity.  The best way to commorate women's status  as persons, VSW points out, would be to  permit women to have a standard of living  which all persons deserve. Both levels of  government could bring women up to person  status by:  * increasing old age pensions and supplements to levels above the poverty line  * increasing social assistance rates, especially for single parents  * instituting a scheme of guaranteed annual  income, at levels above the poverty line.  Never daunted, we cable these demands to  David MacDonald, the federal minister responsible for the status of women, and to  Grace McCarthy, B.C.'s human resources  minister.  In the House of Commons, Pauline Jewett  (NDP for New Westminster-Coquitlam) accuses  Ron Atkey, the employment minister, of  doing a snow job on women's employment  concerns.  The Conservatives,   Jewett says, promised  to give women's outreach programs high  priority... to restore the $3 million slashed by the Liberal government.   But they've  only provided $300,00.  While I'm bitterly disappointed in the government's retreat in an empty-rhetoric  policy towards women,  I cannot say that I  she adds.

The struggle is an international one that  extends beyond national borders and affects  women throughout the world.  Citing various legal and judicial decisions from the United States, Greece and  Columbia, DeCrow pointed out that the declaration of women as persons, within the  context of section 24 of the BNA Act, provided women in Canada with an important  precedent upon which to build.  It 's a kindergarten step,   but an important one,  nonetheless,   DeCrow stated.  During a lengthy question period following her talk, DeCrow urged the women in  the audience not to get discouraged by  the apparent conservative backlash.  There never really was a  "frontlash" for  'anything to go back on,   DeCrow commented.  She added that there have been significant  changes in society during the last ten to  15 years which women should take heart in.  The battle to achieve equality has never  been.an, easy one, but it shall be won.  To conclude, DeCrow chose to quote from  One of the five Albertan women who had  fought to have women declared as persons,  and one of her own few heroes - Nellie  McClung:  Never retract,  never apologize.   Get the  thing done and let them howl I  The message was well received by the disheartened crowd and lent much strength  to the presentation of the "Persons Award"  which took place just prior to DeCrow's  speech.  The award had been set up by the UBC Women's Committee to recognize a female member of the university community who hae  made a significant contribution to the  well-being of all women on campus.

So to obtain relief under those sections  which relate to the custody of children, along with occupation and non-  entry, Section 6 (l) a, b and c of the  Family Relations Act, an applicant must  go to the Supreme Court of British  Columbia.  In contrast with the relatively informal  procedures at family court, proceedings  at the supreme court level are very  complex and involve lawyers, making legal relief more costly and inaccessible  to low income people.  The Legal Services Society is providing  legal aid to qualifying applicants, but  that may not last too long.  The department of the Attorney General  has stated that the decision will be appealed.  But that process will take several months,  and in the meantime confusion, uncertainty and needless expense will continue  to rule in situations which are at best  difficult and often down-right dangerous.*  October's trial, what  happened to Anne  Russell  When Anne Russell, the second member of  the SFU 18 to come to trial, showed up in  court October 29, she learned that the  prosecution was not proceeding with the  first charge, "obstructing a highway."  But they did go ahead with the second,  "wilfully obstructing a peace officer in  the execution of his duty."  Two members of the Burnaby RCMP spent  the morning testifying.

Persons Project, Feminist History Group  Emily Murphy became the first woman magistrate in the British Empire in 1916.  On her first day presiding over the newly-  established V/omen's Court in Edmonton, a  lawyer objected that since she was not  even a "person" under the law, she had  no right to be a magistrate. He elaborated: under British Common Law women were  persons "in the matter of pains and penalties, but not in the matter of rights and  privileges," and since holding public  office was a privilege women were not  entitled to it.  This objection was raised a number of  times in Judge Murphy's court, and also  in the court of the second woman magistrate in Alberta, Alice Jamieson. When  one of the latter's decisions was appealed on the grounds of women not being  qualified to act as magistrates, the  Alberta Supreme Court ruled in 1921 that:  Applying the general principle on which  the common law rests, namely of reason  and good sense, as applied to new conditions, there is in common law no legal  disqualification for holding public office in the government of this country,  arising from any distinction of sex.  That settled the problem as far as Alberta  was concerned, but women's status federally was still unclear, and that bothered  Emily Murphy.  In 1919 she became the  driving force behind a petition from the  Federated Women's Institutes of Canada  requesting that a woman be appointed to  the Senate.  Since women had recently won the right  to vote in federal elections and to sit  in the House of Commons, entry into the  Senate was the logical next step in the  quest for equal rights. But as Emily  Murphy knew, entrance into the Senate  held more than symbolic importance.  Because of the wording of the relevant  sections of the British North America  Act (The BNA Act), senators had to be  "persons" and consequently, if a woman  was appointed to the Senate it would  settle the question of women's status  under Canadian law.  In the next few years a number of women's  groups followed the example of the  Women's Institutes and sent in petitions  requesting that a woman be named to the  Senate. Some of the petitions specified  Emily Murphy as the woman most deserving  of the honour.  Despite the efforts of  these women, the federal government did  nothing.  The story was the same from  1921 to 1927 - governments expressed sympathy but pointed out the difficulty with •  "persons" and the BNA ACT, and took no  steps toward either appointing a woman,  or ammending the BNA Act.  (One Senator,  Archibald McCoig, did give notice of a  motion for an amendment to the BNA Act  to allow women to sit in the Senate, but  he failed to turn up the day the motion  was called, and no further action was  taken. )  By 1927 Emily Murphy had waited long enough.  She had discovered that any five interested  parties could petition the Supreme Court of  Canada for a ruling on a point of constitutional law, and that the government would  pay court costs if it felt the case was  sufficiently important.  Emily Murphy made  inquiries, and the government agreed the  case was important enough.  For her co-appellants Emily Murphy chose  four fellow residents of Alberta, all women  known for their interest in public affairs.  The women were: Henrietta Muir Edwards,  author of The Legal Status of Women in  Alberta and The Legal Status of Women in  Canada, and, for twenty years, the covener  of the National Council of Women's standing committee on laws relating to women  and children: Nellie McClung, noted author,  lecturer, and former Alberta MLA; Louise  McKinney, prominent member of the WCTU  and IODE, and one of the first two women  MLA's in Alberta; and Irene Parlby, Minister Without Portfolio in the government  then in power in Alberta. The women  signed the petition alphabetically, so the  case is official known as Edwards vs. The  Attorney-General of Canada, despite the  fact that Emily Murphy was the prime  mover behind the case.  The exact wording of the question submitted to the Supreme Court was "Does the word  "persons" in section 21,  of the British  North America Act unclude female persons?"  Section 24 states that "The Governor-  General shall from time to time (...)  summon qualified persons to the Senate."  Section 23 lists the qualifications,  using the pronoun "he" throughout (for  instance, "He shall be of the full age  of thirty years") but does not state  explicitly that senators must be male.  The case came to court in 1928. While  each province was entitled to send counsel in support of either side, only two  provinces chose to do so.  Quebec sent a lawyer to support the federal case; N.W. Rowell acted jointly  for women and the province of Alberta.  Rowell based his argument largely on two  points.  First, by the Interpretation Act  of 1850 which was in force when the BNA  Act was passed, words importing the masculine gender had to "be deemed to include Females (...) unless the contrary  as to Gender (...) is expressly provided." The BNA Act makes no such express provision.  Second, when women were  granted the federal franchise, section  41 of the BNA Act had been interpreted  to include women as persons, and it would  be contradictory for "persons" to mean  one thing in one part of the Act and  something else in another section.  The lawyer for the opposition argued that  the BNA Act had to be interpreted precisely as.it was intended in the period  when it was passed, and that since women  did not hold public office at that time,  it could not have been intended for them  to be among the "persons" eligible for  the Senate.  The lawyer sited the decision in Choriton  vs Lings, an 1868 British case where the  judges had to decide if .a statute con-► Kinesis November '79 5  ferring a women, in view of the Interpretation Act.  In that case the judges took gender  being "easily provided" to mean "clearly  implied," rather than ''explicitly stated",  and decided that despite the Interpretation Act the statue only applied to  males, because under Common Law only  males could vote, and if Parliament had  intended to introduce such a radical  change as women's suffrage, it would have  been more explicit about it. The parallel with the framers of the BNA Act  only intending males to be senators was  obvious.  The Supreme Court weighed the arguments  and decided that "Women are not 'qualified persons' within the meaning of section 24 of the R-Ht.ish North America  Act, 1967, and therefore are not eligible  for appointment by the Governor-General  to the Senate of Canada."  After hearing of the decision, the Minister of Justice said that the government  would take steps to have the BNA Act  amended. When the Parliamentary session  ended and nothing had been done, Emily  Murphy received permission to appeal the  case to the Judicial Committee of the  Privy Council in London (the JCPC), at  that time the highest court of appeal  for Canada. Alberta sent the provincial-  Attorney-General to support Rowell;  Quebec withdrew its counsel.  Neither side made any major changes in  their arguments, but the JCPC came to a  difference conclusion than the Supreme  Court of Canada.  Their Lordships stated  that "the exclusion of women from all  public offices is a relic of days more  barbarous than ours...and that the appeal  to history in this particular case is not  conclusive." They also set down the  "living, tree" constitutional doctrine:  'Their Lordships do not conceive to be  (their) duty (...) to cut down the provision of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give  it a large and liberal interpretation.  (...) The British North America Act  planted in Canada a living tree capable  of growth and expansion within its  natural limits.  They concluded that "persons" in section  24 did include women and that women were  therefore eligible to sit in the Senate.  The date of the decision was October 18,  1929.  The case was a milestone in both the  history of women's rights in Canada and  in Canadian constitutional law.  It would  have been a fitting tribute for Emily  Murphy to have been the first woman  called to the Senate.  Instead, the honour  went to Cairine Wilson.  Legend has it  that when an unnamed Senator was asked  why Emily Murphy was never appointed,  he replied, "Murphy in the Senate!  She  would have caused too much trouble!"«  Mabel French et al.  — legal women  Mabel Penery French was granted the degree  of Bachelor of Civil Law y the University  of King's College, Windsor, Nova Scotia,  in 1905.  In 1906, she applied for admission to the New Brunswick Bar. She was  rejected on the grounds that under British  Common Law only "persons" could practice  law, and women were not "persons".  The  New Brunswick legislature remedied the  situation by passing a Special Act allowing women to practice law.  Shortly thereafter, Mabel French became the first woman  lawyer in New Brunswick.  In 1911, Mabel French applied to the B.C.  Bar to practice law. She was faced with  precisely the same objection she had met'  in New Brunswick - that since women were  not "persons" under British Common Law,  the Bar Act was.not meant to apply to  them.  Thus ruled the Law Society of  British Columbia, and their decision was  upheld both when she took the matter to  court, and on appeal. To add insult to  injury, the Law Society demanded she pay  all court costs.  Mrs. Farris, a Vancouver feminist, was  playing bridge with Mabel French's attorney when he told her of the case and suggested she might want to do something a-  bout it. The next morning, Mrs. Farris  went to the Vancouver office of William  Bowser, then the Attorney-General of B.C.,  and insisted he introduce an act to remedy  the situation.  Bowser (an opponent of women's suffrage)  was not enthusiastic. He told Mrs. Farris  that there was no time - the legislative  session was due to end in less than a  week. Mrs. Farris, however, did not give  up easily, and her will prevailed. "An  Act to Remove the Disability of Women in-  so far as it Relates to the Study and  Practice of Law' was introduced forthwith,  and received Royal Assent on the last day  of the legislative sitting. On April 1,  1912, Mabel French became the first woman  admitted to the B.C. Bar.  Edith Paterson was the second woman lawyer in B.C., and the first B.C.-born  woman to qualify as a lawyer. A graduate  of McGill University and Osgoode Hall,  she was called to the B.C. Bar in 1916.  She practiced with two Vancouver law firms,  and eventually became a partner in the  firm of Hamilton, Read, and Paterson.  She  was appointed a Juvenile Court Judge in  1929.  The appointment, made by the newly-  elected Conservative government, aroused  controversy because Paterson, a Conservative, replaced Helen Gregory MacGill, a  Liberal.  Paterson served as a judge until  1934, and then returned to private practice,  Soon after the turn of the century, Helen  Gregory MacGill moved to Vancouver.  She  was already interested in many reforms,  including women's suffrage.  In 1910, she  arranged for several lawyers to lecture  to the club on B.C. laws relating to  women and children. What they said kindled her interest - that unless B.C. had  legislated otherwise, the laws that ap-  Suffrage activists in  Victoria  The fight for women's suffrage, whether  in Canada or elsewhere, marked the first  large-scale organized emergence of women  into the political sphere. A factor  that is generally overlooked, though, is  that the suffrage movement encompassed  far more than the fight to obtain the  vote. Suffrage was closely linked with  the temperance movement and the drive  for other moral reforms. Many members of  the Women's Christian Temperance Union  were active suffragists.  Women believed that once they obtained  the vote, they would not only elect pro-  temperance candidates, but would bring  about other types of social legislation.  Their concerns included: the legal rights  of women and children, equal pay for  equal work, education, infant mortality,  and the plight of both poor women and  children.  The first known suffrage agitation in  Victoria occurred in 1871 when the American suffragist, Susan B. Anthony, rented  the Alhambra Hall and gave a series of  lectures meant to inspire local women to  take up the cause. Victoria women began  their fight on the municipal level by  voting in the civic elections in 1874 -  a right they would gain and lose periodically until 1914.  In addition to WCTU,  the Local Council of Women were major  supporters of women's rights and in 1907  became the first Council in Canada to  endorse suffrage.  They sponsored Emme-  line Pankhurst's visit to Victoria in  1911 and with their support, Maria Grant  was elected the first woman school  trustee in Victoria, marking another level  where the suffrage question was settled.  Though the suffrage fight had been carried  on for forty years in Victoria, it was  not until 1910 that the first organization in B.C. dedicated primarily to  suffrage was founded.  The Political  Equality League, as it was called, believed that the vote was a means to an  Helen Gregory MacGill, I  plied in B.C. were those in force in England at the time B.C. became a Crown Colony, that is, 1958.  Intrigued, she investigated further, and in 1912 she published  her findings in the book, 'Daughters,  Wives, and Mothers, of British Columbia'.  Official" recognition of her expertise came  in 1917 when she was appointed a juvenile  court judge, making her B.C.'s first woman  judge. She held that position until 1929,  when an incoming Conservative government  failed to re-appoint her following the  redistribution of judicial boundaries in  Vancouver. She was re-appointed in 1934.  In her twenty-three years on the bench,  not one of her decisions was reversed.  Many of the legal and social reforms advocated by Helen Gregory MacGill became  law.f  n judge  end, not an end in itself.  From 1912-14,  they published a magazine, The Champion,  edited by Maria Grant and Dorothy Davis,  which relayed news cf the suffrage movement from around the world.  In 1913,  Davis broke from the P.E.L. to form a  second suffrage organization, the Women's  Freedom Union, popularly known as the  "Go-Aheads."  In British Columbia, a referendum dealing  with women's franchise and prohibition  was held in September, 1916, and was  preceded by a huge rally in Victoria.  Both measures passed, but delayed results  of the soldiers' vote reversed the pro=  hibition results.  The next spring, a bill  was introduced into the Legislature and  women officially received the vote on  April 5, 1917. • 6 Kinesis November '79  LABOUR  Radio Shack is a turn-off  They're calling it another Fleck. At  Tandy Electronics Ltd. - Radio Shack in  Barrie, Ontario, the workers at out on  strike for their first contract.  The issues are union recognition - the  right to have a union - and arrogant company rules that would enable Radio Shack  to transfer, demote, and even fire employees at will.  The Radio Shack workers  are mostly women.  The real issue, the strikers say, is this:  Is Radio Shack more powerful than the  Ontario government?  The government says employees have a right  to join a union. Radio Shack fired employees for joining a union.  The government's labour relations board  ordered the employees reinstated. Radio  Shack disregarded the labour board order.  The labour board ordered Radio Shack to  pay the employees who were unlawfully  fired for the time they missed.  Radio  Shack refused to pay them.  The labour board certified the Steelworkers union to represent 200 Radio Shack  workers in 1978. Radio Shack appealed  the certification to the Supreme Court  of Ontario.  The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the  union.  Radio Shack appealed again on  •another legal technicality.  The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the  union again. In their unanimous decision  of August 8, 1979, the three judges said  To accept Radio Shack's arguments and  deny the employees their union "would fly  in the face of the intent of the legislation" of Ontario.  The union brought over 25 charges against  Radio Shack at the labour board and won  every one. Still the company refuses to  recognize the employees want a union.  Is Radio Shack stronger than the government of Ontario?  In negotiations the company offered no  guaranteed pay increase to anyone, only  a "merit" system Radio Shack claims would  be worth 6%  over one year - less than the  cost of living. Base rates at Radio '  Shack would be only $3.83 an hour.  The company has offered no improvements  in vacations, the welfare plan, overtime,  shift premiums or sick leave.  This company even insists on a contract  clause that could see the union fined  $10,000 if any member refers to the company "by suggestion or innuendo" without  the permission of the company president!  Radio Shack sales were $150 million in  Canada last year and a billion dollars  world-wide. Every day two more Radio  Shack stores open somewhere in the world.

Urge  your friends to support the boycott.*  Chauvinist is not allowed  off the hook  Gillnetter Jonathan Young of the vessel  For'Ray is finding his relations with Prince  Rupert shoreworkers seriously strained  since he fired deckhand - cook Linda Douglas  in June.  Three times since his peremptory June 14  dismissal of Douglas he has had difficulty  unloading his catch at Prince Rupert plants.  On all occasions UFAWU shoreworkers stopped  work to study the situation when For'Ray  appeared, and by the time shoreworkers had  decided what to do, For'Ray had already  cast off.  Douglas said in an interview, she was hired  May 19, started working May 23, and spent  several days aboard the For'Ray cleaning  up and buying supplies prior to sailing  for Prince Rupert from Vancouver, June 6.  Shortly after departure, Young presented  her with a predated contract agreement to  sign, which stated she was hired as a deckhand-cook, and that she would receive 10  percent of the gross catch at the end of ■  the season after she cleaned up the boat  and stored the gear and equipment.  Douglas said that Young made no negative  comments about her performance as a deckhand-cook throughout the trip, but added  "his attitude changed when I went out on  my first evening off in Prince Rupert,  June 13."  Apparently annoyed that she had spent the  evening relaxing, Young fired her the  next day for "difference in values" and  for "being too independent," gave her a  mere $100, and presented her with a receipt stating the cash was payment in full  for services rendered from June 6 - 13.  UFAWU northern organizer Joy Thorkelson  said August 16, that Prince Rupert shore-  workers stopped work when For'Ray arrived  to discuss how they should deal with what  appeared as a clear-cut case of chauvinism.  Thorkelson added that shoreworke s are  angry at the way "some women are treated  aboard fishing industry vessels."*)  (The Fisherman,  August  7   '79)  AN EQUAL OfftRniNtfl EMROVER  Mmm  GIRLS!

When she was rejected for the job of junior  assistant in the ministry's pre-Cambrian  geology department, McKittrick laid a complaint with the Ontario human rights commission.

Even if it is a partial victory, it will  improve things for a huge number of people  Linda Geyer, a spokesman for the Household  Workers Association, said Wednesday.  Besides assuring a uniform hourly wage  which will be set later this year, the  legislation will also fix working hours,  statutory holidays and paid vacations.  Quebec is the second province to enact  such a law.  Newfoundland has had one for  some years.  Covered are live-in maids, housekeepers  and cleaning ladies, but association president Gracia Constantineau told a news  conference that baby sitters and those  who take care of elderly or handicapped  individuals are exempt, even though their  chores may include housework.  Most other workers in the province are  guaranteed a minimum wage of $3-47 an hour,  but the level to be set for domestics is  expected to be slightly less, Mrs. Constantineau said.  She agreed it would be difficult for some  young parents to pay more than $3.00 an  hour for a babysitter.  "But if they have young children at home,  they should stay home with them", she said,  recalling how she worked nights to do just  that with her two offspring.  And, while acknowledging a shortage of daycare centres, she said domestics shouldn't  be expected to do charity work beceuse  society is "failing in its duties".  Some domestics are currently earning a  mere $1.05 an hour, "are expected to  sleep in the furnace room and have to  fight for every bite they are given to  eat," she said.«  On October 15 an arbitration award ruled  that getting coffee for a supervisor violated a staff agreement which says an  SFU 18—update  from p.3,  col 3  that the BCTV video would contradict  evidence given by RCMP witnesses.

All charges against the SFU 18 must be  dropped now.   These proceedings are  simply intimidation and harassment.  The RCMP should be charged for attacking a legal picket line and then lying  in court.  Once the charges against Anne Russell  had been completely dropped, the  third member of the SFU 18, Ted Urwin,  was granted a stay of proceedings on  both counts.

On the day of the rally and picket,  she was emcee, and held the public address system in her hand.

It's clear that the Crown is taking  every step it can think of to prevent  the SFU 18 from getting clear   acquittals,  Carroll added.• Kinesis November '79 7  At B.C. Ice and Storage  Fed issues hot edict, but Jorgensen is still out in the cold  Ann Schaeffer  Things are hot at B.C. Ice and Cold Storage!  The B.C. Fed issued a hot edict early last  month against products leaving the company's Commissioner Street plant as members of the United Fisherman and Allied  Workers Union entered the tnird month of  a strike against the warehouse facilities.  Meanwhile, UFAWU has dropped a key contract demand, leaving Susan Jorgensen, a  B.C. Ice fish racker, to battle it out  in the courts.  The union is no longer  demanding equal pay for equal' work in  contract negotiations, but is focusing  instead on a $1.10 across-the-board increase which would leave sex discrimination in wages and job opportunities  intact, while moving towards parity withh  wages paid to B.C. Ice workers at Valley  Freezer in Abbotsford (Canadian Food and  Allied Workers Union - Meatcutters).  The company's last offer - 83^ across-  the-board, was defeated by a 95% vote.  The offer would have denies a raise to  Group workers - the eight women at the  plant who do "light", supposedly "less  onerous" work than male Group 1 workers,  until 1,000 hours of work were accumulated rather than the 400 now required.  UFAWU President Jack Nichol, said the  offer "is an affront to those who are  really concerned about human rights.  Borth groups would have to work 1000  hours to get a raise, but after 1000  hours, women would still get less than  men." The difference would be about  65^ an hour.  To rid the contract of  sex discrimination would require est-  ablshing a single 1000-hour rate and  abolishing the two groups ("light" and  "Heavy" work) now embodied in the  contract. According to Jorgensen, the  union dropped its equal pay demand in  response to the company's attempts to  mask sex discrimination in the contract  with this sort of mumbo-jumbo.  She's not giving up  But she's not giving up.  So it's back  to the patience-trying process of waiting for her next day in front of a  Human Rights Board of Inquiry and, when  it finally arrives in January, of submitting to hours of testimony and cross-  examination about the status of women at  the plant.  It's already been 2\  years  since Jorgensen first laid charges of sex  discrimination against B.C. Ice and the  entire fishing industry("I laid 19 charges  in one day") and the next (hopefully last)  Human Rights Board of Inquiry meeting is to  take place almost a year after its initial  appointment by Labour Minister Alan Williams.  The board, having been finally  appointed, will have been messing around  with postponements and delays for twelve  months by the time the case comes up in  January 1980.  Jorgensen has charged that, in her five  years at B.C. Ice, there were many occasions on which she racked fish at the  rate of pay for light work next to men  who were receiving the higher rate for  heavier work.  In addition, she charges  she was denied the opportunity to qualify for the higher Group 1 wages, even  though she had performed the heavier  jobs at times.  If Jorgensen wins her  case, she will get a settlement of which  the union, as co-respondent with B.C.  Ice, will have to pay 50%.  "I'm also  asking for back pay for all the other  women up to the time I laid charges,  and for all the time I was laid off as  a Group 2 worker when Group 1 workers  weren't, and pay for the wear and tear  to my nerves," said Jorgensen. A decision in her fabour would set a precedent for the 2500 women in the fishing  industry, perhaps paving the way for  equal pay for equal work clauses in  UFAWU contracts, a principle which hasn't  been won on the picket line.  Two women  in.Prince Rupert, Lesley Fell and Francine Freeman, are currently protesting  discrimination in pay rates in the  shoreworkers' section of the fishing  industry, in which men, but not women,  automatically receive a wage increase  after 1000 hours.  This results in a 65^  discrepancy between wages of men and  women workers.  In a letter to MLA  Rosemary Brown, Fell and Freeman wrote,  "As two female members of the United  Fisherman and Allied Workers Union, we  feel that the union executive has not  been forceful, in pressing management  to end this discrimination."  UFAWU women's committee  Jorgensen says, "We've started a Women's  Rights Committee in UFAWU this year for  women who don't want to go the route I  did, fighting all by themselves." But  she also says UFAWU president Nichol  has been very helpful in the hearings  and that she has been surprised and  gratified by the testimony of male coworkers who are supportive of her position and say it is obvious that women  should be paid as much as men.  B.C. Ice and Storage is a bonded warehouse which owns none of the goods,  mainly fish, it handles. According to  Jorgensen, the company charges its customers $18-$19 per hour for labour,  whether it is performed by male or female crew members. Work done by women  thus adds a little more cream to the  profits of B.C. Ice, owned by the multi-  million dollar transnational Versatile  Cornat Corporation, whose main shareholder is CanFor Investments Ltd.,  owned in turn, by Canadian Forest Products Ltd.  In the first quarter of 1979, Versatile  Cornat Corp. reported earnings of $5.7  million, versus $2.3 in the same period  of 1978.  Besides their interests in the  largest public cold storage warehouse in  B.C. (a monopoly in the Lower Mainland),  the corporation owns a thriving farm  machinery division, the Burrard Yarrows  (shipyard division which has recently  won a contract for $58 million for two  new B.C. Ferries vessels), an oil company (Bralorne Resources), and financial,  real estate, steel, and forest products  companies.  To demonstrate that they are  not as much of a conglomerate as they  appear at first glance, the company executive have recently divested themselves  of moving and storage companies and  claim that most of their remaining  assets revolve around steel. As of  December 1978 Versatile Cornat had  assets of $223 million.  And they're quibbling over 65^ an hour  for women workers.*  Shoreworkers demand  action to end  sex discrimination  Two Prince Rupert women from the United  Fisherman and Allied Workers union are  pressing the union to confront management  about sex discrimination in rates of pay  within the shoreworkers' section of B.C.'s  fishing industry.  Francine Freeman and Lesley Fell point out  that the average wage earned by women  shoreworkers is sixty-five cents per hour  less than that of their male counterparts.  This inequity arises because of the manner  in which the companies issue the second  of two guaranteed wage increases.  The first increase is of $1.04 per hour  given to all shoreworkers after 400 hours  of work experience.  The second increase of sixty-five cents  an hour, due after 1,000 hours, is given  only to men.  This is an automatic raise for men, whether  or not they possess work-related skills.  The only way a woman can attain this pay  rate is by becoming an officially qualified filleter, a position achieved through  skill, unrelated to total work hours.  This unfair treatment, Fell and Freeman  point out, "creates the classic situation  of the woman with many years experience  earning less than the young man with only  a few years experience."  The companies justify this appalling state  of affairs by resorting to the old chestnut of "job description".  This allows  them to define men's work as heavy work  and women's work as light work.  "Driving  a fork-lift is automatically a "man's job",  Fell told Kinesis.  "The fact that the jobs done are equally  strenuous and often identical in nature  is ignored.  Take Martha Ross, for example.  She's an employee of Atlin Fisheries in  Prince Rupert, where she holds the position  of tallyman. Martha has attained her 1,000  hours but is being denied the pay raise  due her."  Fell had three year's experience within  the industry, and had more than 1000 hours  experience.  But she was still being paid  at the 400 hour level.  A UFAW representative of the northern area  had met with Fell, Freeman and others and  had given them assurances that the essential issue in the 1979 contract negotiation  would be the matter of sex discrimination  between the 400 hour rate and the 1000  hour rate.  "But after a few meetings in Vancouver,"  Fell told Kinesis, "they decided to shelve  the whole thing." 'Ģ is November '79  WOMEN AND WORK  H OSU. V ,1 \ /; WORK from page I  guaranteed to make you conspicuous.  *Women face issues that male workers seldom have to consider. Overtime is one -  its unpredictability is difficult for any  mother, and especially so for single  mothers. Yet it can also be unwise to  refuse it.  *How do you relate to women you work with  who are doing traditional jobs?  It's  important to let them know you think their  work is both undervalued and underpaid,  rather than let your positions divide you.  * As a woman in a non-traditional field  ■:11 occasionally be put in the position of asserting the principle that women  are able to 'do something, and doing it,  even'if it's not exactly what you might  want for yourself.  * Finally, what is 'unusual' about women  in non-traditional jobs is not that we  are doing "men's" work, but that we are  doing it officially, and.demanding that  our apprenticeships be recognized.  Women not yet involved In non-traditional  jobs had some doubs.  One was, "Are there  jobs that women are not strong enough to  do?" Although there was some disagreement around this questions, most did a-  gree that where there are jobs that women  can't do, these are most likely jobs that  most men also can't do.  It's important  to recognize that machinery exists to do  heavy tasks, and'where men are.doing-  heavy work bodily, it's most often a  case of the employer exploiting their  labour.  Anther woman wanted to know whether women  in non-traditional jobs had always done  that type of work.  She was reassured that  most of us had backgrounds much like her  Finally, it was pointed out that alot of  apprentices start out in a trade with no  training or experience, and that as women  we shouldn't let that hold us back,  although it it advantageous to develop  whatever knowledge we have.  Lack of confidence is probably the biggest fear we  each have to face.  A "Women in Trades Association" is being  formed as a result of interest expressed  in this and other meetings. An organizational meeting will be held Sunday, November 25th at 2:00pm In Room L4 (above  the library) of Britannia Centre, 1661.  Napier Street, Vancouver, to talk about  structure and activities.

A support network  is badly needed.•  Labour History workshop  Women, despite lack  of support, did organize  ■The B.C. Labour History workshop, presented  by SFU's Women's Labour History Project,  included tapes of women who were active  in union organizing throughout the 30's  and 40's, a priceless contribution to our  aural herstory.  It also covered a history  of women organizing in the last depression  (see Sara Diamond's centre feature in the  June '79 Kinesis) and organized women  workers in Vancouver from 1900 to 1915,  researched by Star Rosenthal.  "As a consequence of ignorance of the role  of women in the labour movement," Rosenthal pointed out, "various myths have  arisen." One of these myths is that women  have not attempted, in the past, to organize.  The other is that women are unorgan-  Izable.  "The trade-union movement has  both shared in and propagated these assumptions.  Then and now a male-dominated  movement, it has a tendency to view women  as reactionary, materialistic and non-  class conscious."  In the early years of this centry, these  myths were compounded by medical theories  of the day, which "led people to believe,  for example, that work in factories wasn't  Woman working  healthy for women specifically, rather  than leading them to push for improved  health and safety standards for all workers. "  These factors contributed to the resolution  of the Dominion Trades and Labour Council  in 1903 that called for "abolition of  child labor by children under 14 years of  age; and of female labor in all branches  of industrial life, such as mines, workshops, factories, etc."  By 1915, there may have been a change for  the better in official policy, as the  Trades and Labour Congress of that year  moved to amend the 1903 motion to the  abolition of child labour by children ■  under 16 and "the establishing of the  principle of equal pay for equal work of  men and women."  Despite lack of support from union brothers, Rosenthal emphasizes, "women did  organize.  They joined male unions,  formed their own locals, and even their  own separate unions in many of the main  occupations in which they were employed.  In addition to this, they gave active  support to men's union struggles, and  organized campaigns to buy only union-  made goods in what they called "Label"  ■ campaigns.  A feature of women's organizations during  this period is that they were generally  short-lived.  "Their failure," says  Rosenthal, "seems to be due ... to objective conditions such as economic depression, lack of labour movement  support, lack of legislative protection  and political power."  In B.C. in 1911, 44$ of working women  were domestic and personal service workers, 19.6% were in manufacturing and  "professionals" (stenographers, typists,  teachers, nurses) made up 19.5% of the  female work force.  These are clearly isolated workers,  scattered in homes, offices and stores  across the city.  Rosenthal provided .an account of some of  the major organizing efforts of the time,  including the two major strikes by B.C.  Tel operators in 1902 and 1906.  Possibly the most interesting union of the  period, said Rosenthal, was the Home and  Domestic Employees Union of British Columbia.  "This organization was made up  entirely of women and was not connected  with any male union.  The aims and policies of the union were expressly radical  and feminist."  This union started on March 1913, when  35 women met at the Labor Temple.  "They  were governesses, housemaids, nursemaids,  cooks and other domestic workers.  Their  aims were ambitious." The three main  objectives of the union were - the nine-  hour day, a minimum wage, and recognition  as a body of industrial workers. What's  more, they hoped "to establish a union  hiring hall where employers would directly contract workers, to keep records on  every place where members had worked or  were at present employed, and to someday lease the building for a cooperative  rooming house where they could live in  healthy surroundings and enjoy a social  life," Rosenthal told the workshop.  The Home and Domestic Employees union rejected the low status of their work,  and pledged themselves to "do all in our  power to dignify the labour pertaining  thereto."  The president of this union was Lillian  Coote, whose articles for the B.C. Federation! st provide a rare and valuable  picture of how working women of those  days saw themselves.  Cbote didn't have much time for upper and  middle class women. On the same day as  the Home and Domestic Employees Union was  formed, Coote reports, there were 200  women out on the streets selling a women's  edition of a daily paper to raise money  for a Women's Building.  Coote said:  "one cannot help wondering whether the  many philanthropically inclined women of  this province have seen fit to practically  ignore the domestic problem question,  owing to the fact that the remedy would  affect them"  What busted this union was a depression.  When formed, in 1913, the average wage of ■  domestics was $30 a month plus room and  board.  By the end of 1915, this had  fallen to $10 - $15 a month. Women, out  of work in other trades, turned to domestic service in large numbers, lowering  the wages.  Rosenthal's research, which gave workshop  participants access to new and fascinating  material, is available in B.C. STUDIES,  #41, "Union Maids: Organized Women Workers  in Vancouver 1900-1915."

They brought the following resolutions to  the conference plenary. All were endorsed.  * That we reaffirm, as part of our struggle, the right of any women to choose  whatever lifestyle she finds most satisfying and fulfilling.  This includes the  right of a woman to choose a' lesbian lifestyle .  * That we recognize that lesbians, as well  as all women, work both inside and outside  the home.  Lesbians are discriminated  against by the laws, the lack of legal  protection and negative attitudes all of  which lead to verbal and phusical harassment, abuse exploitation, oppression, ridicule and not being hired or being fired.  We recognize that it is the responsibility  of all women and men here to actively support the fight to end the discrimination ,  and the oppression of lesbians through the  following:  - Examining of your own attitudes: including discrimination against lesbians in  conferences and workshops.  - Fighting for the inclusion of sexual  orientation in union contracts.  - Defending women being harassed for  being lesbians.  - Supporting women coming out as lesbians  on the job.  - Speaking out against bigotry, prejudice  both on the job, at home and in social  situations.  ■ - Supporting existing groups developing  resources for lesbians (Drop-In, L.I.L.,  Gay and Lesbian Caucus) for changes  with your energy and/or your money.  * As feminists, we recognize the importance  of our children being raised and educated  in a way that is non-oppressive. As we  teach others about our needs and ourselves  to struggle with and against the injustice  of this society, we need vehicles to allow  and encourage our children to develop their  awareness and to be fully part of our  growth as a movement.*  What the "right-to-  worker s" are up to  Unions Under Attack and Myths About Union  were two workshops which specifically  addressed current problems now facing  the union movement.  The Myths About Unions workshop told the  pleanary. that it was essential that we  understand the tacts of the so-called  "right-to-work" movement (a right wing  misnomer like "right-to-life..")  The right to work movement make a big  deal out of their version of "free riders",  a union leadership which takes dues but  does not deliver for rank and file membership. To a unionist, "free rider" means  a person who does not pay union dues but  who gets the benefits fought for by the  union.  *  Right to work advocates demand free unions,  stating that everyone should be allowed  to join whichever union they want, thus  undermining the concept of strength in  collectivity.  They also make an issue of the support  given by unions to specific political  parties, while ignoring the fact that big  business also gives financial support to  the parties of their choice.  From the Unions Under Attack workshop came '  a resolution condemning the federal government's attacks on CUPW's president,  Jean Claude Parrot.*     Kinesis staff writers  Debra Lewis ^ ^'<^&/$^^A&S&&-  VSW has chosen the issue of sexual harassment on the job as one of our priority  issues for this year. So far, we have  been involved in gathering information  from both Canadian and American sources,  and planning ways to fund solutions to  the problem.  Research to date has indicated that such  harassment is rampant. Estimates of the  proportion of working women who are subjected to harassment range from 50%  to  90%. As is clear from the chart, the vast  majority of these cases are never dealt  ■ with - women do not report through fear  of reprisals or ridicule (and information  shows that our fears are well founded),  complaints are -ignored, etc.etc.  In fact,  this estimate concludes" that AT LEAST 17%  OF ALL WORKING WOMEN SUFFER DIRECT DEMONSTRABLE DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF SEXUAL  HARASSMENT.  This1 does not include women  who "voluntarily" quit to avoid further  harassment or the psycholical effects of  working under such conditions.  Current avenus of redress for sexual -  harassment are limited at best. The  Human Rights Branch of the Department of  Labour will accept complaints. Although  some settlements have been accomplished  through informal negotiations, no cases  have yet gone to a Board of Inquiry.  In  addition, the vast majority of human  rights complaints are made after a job is  lost or quit due to harassment, so this  avenue affords little protection while  on the j ob.  The only other legal avenue presently  available is that of the criminal law.  This route, however, is only useful in  Sexual Harassment  is an issue for 1980  the most extreme of cases (ie. actual physical assault, etc.) and provides no compensation for the victim involved.  Trade unions provide some present and potential future alternatives, but again  problems arise. First, only a minority  of women are organized into trade unions.  Second, although the B.C. Federation of  Labour released last year an initial  policy statement on the issue, little  has filtered down as yet to local union  level.  This is not to say that the protection of collective agreements will not  be an important protection against sexual  harassment in the future; it is, however,  recognizing it's limits at present.  VSW is planning a series of public education/self help meetings around sexual  harassment beginning in January.  Between  now and then, we will be working on contacting other groups and individuals who  are interested in working on the issue,  with the goal of setting up a core group  from which to begin organizing.  Those  who are interested in working on this  issue should call Debra at VSW, and they  will be informed of any meetings involved.  It is clear that sexual harassment is a  problem that is of intense concern to  working women. VSW participated (with  representatives of Rape Relief and the  Human Rights Branch) in a workshop on the  issue at the recent Working Women Unite  conference.  The women attending the workshop were unanimous in their recognition  cf the seriousness.of the problem.  It  was also generally concluded that it is  only by working collectively that we can  begin to identify solutions.  "Any sexually oriented practice that endangers a woman's job and threatens her  economic livelihood." - - Alliance against  sexual coercion, Cambridge, Massachusetts  "Any repeated and unwanted sexual comments,  looks, suggestions or physical contact  that you find objectionable and causes  you discomfort on the job." - Working  Women United Institute, New York City, NY  "Any sexually oriented practice that undermines a person's job performance, threatens  a person's economic livlihood or educational opportunities, endangers a person's job  or the security of tenure in her/his home  or the opportunity for obtaining a job or  a place to live." - suggested by a researcher in the field of human rights.  Based on the research available to date,  estimates of the proportion of women subjected to sexual harassment on the job  range from 50%—90%.  One study outlined  the possible results of such harassment:  Of 155 '  surveyed:  70%,  (108 women) experience sexual harassment; 75%  (81) ignore it - 25%  (20).of  these were penalized through repremands,  loss of job, etc., 25% (27) took action -  74% (20) of these complained through formal channels, and for 50% (10) of these  nothing happened, and 33% (7) got negative  results, increased workloads, poor personnel reports, etc.  AT LEAST 17% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WOMEN  SURVEYED SUFFERED DIRECT, DEMONSTRABLE  DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF HARASSMENT.  THIS  DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS  OF WORKING UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, WOMEN  WHO "VOLUNTARILY" QUIT THEIR JOBS TO AVOID  FURTHER HARASSMENT, ETC.  (from a study prepared by Working Women  United Institute)• AUOkTlON  From sign-up blitz to ongoing community group  How the Surrey pro-choicers organized for victory  The time: early summer,   1979.  The place: Surrey,  B.C.  A spectacular organizing drive takes  place.  The issue:  the preservation  of the right to choose on abortion  at Surrey Memorial Hosptial.  The organizing was successful on so  many levels.  First,   the pro-choice  faction won.  Second,  many women new  to political work became involved.  Third,   the organizing was indeed conducted at the grass-roots,  door-to-  door level.  And it worked.   Fourth:  out of all that good energy a new,  permanent,   local pro-choice group  has emerged -  the Association for  Choice on Abortion.  Pro-choice plays  catch-up  Ruth Houle  The headline in The Columbian newspaper  stated: "Pro-choice movement played catchup - and won". And that's exactly what  happened at Surrey Memorial Hospital.  Two months before the Annual General Meeting, the pro-choice forces had no name, no  organization, and only a handful of members  of the Hospital Society who supported  women's right to choose when and if to have  a therapeutic abortion.  During that brief period, we gathered together a group of: about thirty workers  who were instrumental in signing up over  2,500 people - enough to win two out of  three of the seafe up for election this  year.  As a result, the eleven member board of  directors retains a pro-choice majority  for another year and, had we mustered  only two more votes, the incumbent pro-  lifer, Don Terry, would have been defeated. The votes tallied were as follows:  Walter Wiebe  1,085  Pro-choice  Douglas Humphreys  1,081  Pro-choice  Don Terry  1,079  Pro-life  James Rhodes  1,078  Pro-choice  Ed Durr  1,074  Pro-life  Simon Faber  1,033  Pro-life  'How did we do it? By the usual way:  large  quantities of exhausting work and much collective thought shared by the women who  comprised 95% of the active committee.  We contacted family planning agencies,  trade unionists, the NDP, sororities  individual church members, employees of  Surrey Hospital, friends, relatives and  neighbours. We sold memberships at all-  candidates meetings, at a flea market, at  plazas, and at all NDP election offices  in the Surrey-Delta area. We canvassed  door to door in the area surrounding the  hospital and the North Surrey Recreation  Centre where the Annual Meeting was to be  held.  Early in our campaign a leaflet was printed  as an aid to canvassing memberships.  The  pamphlet explained the implications of pro-  life policy and what would happen at Surrey  Hospital if pro-lifers gained a majority  on the hospital board - a distinct  possibility since they already controlled  four votes on the eleven member board.  We kept records of all pro-choice voters  signed up and, during the week before June  20, all these people received a call from  our phone committee to remind them of the  meeting and of the importance of being  there.  The night of the meeting we issued a further leaflet, patterned after our information  brochure, which included a clear plea to  vote only for the three candidates we  recommended.  In addition, the committee printed ads in  the Surrey-Delta Messenger and The Columbian  newspapers containing a telephone answering  service number to call.  One of our members collected the calls  daily and, in turn, phoned the fifty to  sixty individuals who responded to the  ads. Of that number only one was a pro-  lifer who wanted to try and convert our  member to pro-life views.  And finally, our group, a mix of people  from all political and cultural backgrounds,  held regular progress meetings where we  assessed past activities and planned future  strategy.  We were most inspired by the assistance  given from members of the Vancouver Concerned Citizens for Choice on Abortion and  by the unflagging assistance given by three  Surrey Memorial Hospital doctors, two of  whom, needless to say, were "female.  A person must be a resident of Surrey or  North or South Delta to join the Surrey  Memorial Hospital Society.  If we missed  anybody during our campaign in the Spring  please let us know.  Our president is  Sharon Vatkin - 591-1457, and she'll be  glad to hear from any supporters who are  willing to do a little or a lot to  help us.  Reprinted from PRIORITIES,  OCTOBER   '?&•  ARC is born  For an update on pro-choice activities  in Surrey, Kinesis spoke with Betty Mc-  Clurg, who is active in the group.  What's happening with the group right  now?  BETTY: We now have a permanent pro-choice  organization in Surrey. At our meeting  last week we gave ourselves a new name:  ARC - the Association for the Right to  Choose.  We will be holding regular meetings  leading up to the 1980 membership drive.  Our first fundraiser - a garage sale -  takes place in the first .of November.  '->hat was your personal experience of  signing people up for the hospital's  AGM this summer?  BETTY: I signed up over 100 people. I  didn't go door-to-door. Different people  in the group chose different strategies.  What I did was go to individuals in various agencies in Surrey - court-workers,  social workers, teachers - people who  work with children and who know what the  problems are.  Most of the door-to-door campaigning was  done in the Newton and Guildford areas.  Those districts have a lot of single-parent families, low-income families. The  response was very good indeed.  How did the canvassing in supermarkets go?  BETTY: Not well. We wouldn't try it again.  People are in too much of a hurry. You  can't really walk up to someone in a shopping mall and say, heyI want to talk about  abortion? They might think you're suggest-  . ing they have one then and there!  But you did well at the all-candidates  meetings,  didn't you?  BETTY: It was extremely useful to us that  the sign-up drive was taking place during .  the federal and provincial elections. All-  candidates meetings were very fertile  sign-up grounds.  The issue of the right to choose on abortion really does cut across all political  lines.  The municipal elections in Surrey are coming up November 17. We have sent all candidates a questionnaire on their position  on abortion. The council sends a representative to the hospital board.  Are there any  "pro-lifers" in the  race?  BETTY: Hugh Buckley is a "pro-lifer." He  narrowly lost the Socred nomination in  this area during the last provincial  elections.  What else is ARC up to?  BETTY: The by-laws of ARCs constitution  give the organization a wider mandate  than simply conducting sign-up drives for  the AGM of the hospital. We will be doing  work in the area of sex education in the  schools, giving birth control information.  Talk about birth control makes the anti-  choicers terrified. They say over and over  that birth control is a "personal issue"  and that they don't want to discuss it  within the context of abortion.  ARC is also concerned with wider issues  at Surrey Memorial, including working  conditions.  Do you plan to run an ARC slate at the  next annual general meeting of Surrey Memorial?  BETTY: We hope to do that. As feminists,  we don't want to have to vote for establishment-oriented businessmen because they  happen to be pro-choice on abortion.  People tend to think of Surrey in terms  of cliches. But in Surrey, you know,  there's really more of "us" than there is  of "them" ! • Kinesis staff writers Kinesis November '79 11  Three women speak of having their first child in their thirties  Women who give birth to a first child after  thirty have been called "elderly mothers"  by the medical profession. Many a mother  who considered herself relatively young has  been abashed to find this phrase on a medical chart at the end of her hospital bed.  Why this discrimination against women over  thirty? There are two practical reasons.  First, it is claimed that there is an increased incidence of down's syndrome (mongolism) in women over thirty.  Some doctors  estimate that the probability of bearing a  child with Down's increases by as much as  one and a half percent for every year that  a woman is past thirty.  A second reason given is that in a sedentary  and principally urban society such as ours,  it is considered that one's general state  of health and fitness is bound to decline  as the years roll by.  Doubting the validity of both these claims,  and suspecting that they may be reflective  of cultural bias against women, Kinesis  collective member Joan Woodward interviewed  three women: Joan Rykyta, Melanie Conn  and Cynthia Flood. Each had her first  child after the age of thirty. Joan was  35, Melanie 34 and Cynthia 33.  KINESIS:    Did you have an amniocentesis?  (Amniocentesis is a test which can be done  to detect down's syndrome.    A sample of  fluid is taken from the amniotic sea with  a syringe.    If the test proves that the  child will be born with mongolism - a type  of severe retardation - the woman may  choose to have the fetus aborted.)  JOAN: No. I went to Vancouver General  Hospital to ask about that. They told me  there wasn't really any risk until a woman  was past the age of 37. And they told me  that if I insisted, I would get into a big  argument with the genetics department.  They don't like to do tests for nothing.  CYNTHIA: No. I wasn't even told there .  was such a test.  MELANIE: No. I had read a great deal on  birth beforehand, and I had the impression  that it wasn't really necessary at least  until after the age of 35.  KINESIS:    You have each mentioned to me  that you planned the birth.     What kind of  financial preparations did you make?    Were  you able to continue working during pregnancy?    Did you have maternity benefits  through a union contract?    What about UIC?  JOAN: In a sense, mine was a planned birth  and in a sense it wasn't. It was planned  in that I had often thought of having a  child through the years. But for various  reasons the time never seemed right. I've  always had problems in terms of financial  survival.  I got pregnant on a weekend fling. He never knew about it, and I knew I'd have to  see it through alone.  But it was planned in the sense that I knew  where to get an abortion if I wanted one.  Instead, I chose to have the child and to  do my best to raise it as a decent human  being. I think that right of choice makes  all the difference in the world.  Final preparations:  I was a part-time  worker in a hospital. As a part-time worker, I wasn't even considered a worker.  Most part-time workers are women, so the  union doesn't feel any obligation to include them.  I fought to be a part of  that union, but the union would have no  part of us.  So, of course, there were no  benefits to be had through a union contract.  I ended up on welfare.  Fortunately, I had many kind friends who  were concerned about both my health and  that of the baby. They donated food, and  helped in other ways as well.  CYNTHIA:  I worked for about the first  four months of my pregnancy. I wasn't  unionized, but I was lucky. Teaching is  not as strenuous as some jobs, and I had  quite an easy pregnancy up to that point.  For the next four months, however, I was  unemployed. My job ran out at the end of  April, and I was able to collect fifteen  weeks only of UIC. They didn't tell me  at the time I applied for the claim that  benefits were for 15 weeks only and could  be for any 15 weeks during pregnancy or  immediately after birth. So for the last  four months, things were really touch and  go.  But we managed, somehow.  MELANIE: I was very well read*on the subject of birth well ahead of time. I had  been a worker at Vancouver Health Collective and had an interest in all  aspects of women's health. Books that I  would recommend are: Our Bodies, Ourselves  Free Delivery; and The Birth Book.  And of course, it was a planned pregnancy.  I had given considerable thought to the  responsibilities involved in being a parent, because I knew that once the decision  was made it would be more or less irrevocable.  CYNTHIA: I'm very glad I didn't have children in my  twenties.  MELANIE: My situation was a little different.  I was living in an intentional  collective in a semi-rural environment.  One of the principles under which we operated was that of pooling our incomes so  that those least able to work would be  provided for and so that power would be  equalized amongst the members of the collective. Another of our principles was  shared responsibility for the children.  So really, I had no worries. And in  spite of all that, I was able to work until six weeks before the baby was born at  fairly strenuous labour.  I was a repairperson for the community's buildings etc.  KINESIS:     What kind of psychological preparations did you make?    Did you have any  particular knowledge of what to expect  during the birth process?  So I think in comparison to many women, I  was very well prepared psychologically.  CYNTHIA: My husband and I had given a lot  of thought to whether or not to have children. We spent about two years considering  it. And we knew as well, particularly in  consideration of our income bracket, that  there would be sacrifices to be made. And  in that sense I'm very glad that I didn't  have children when I was in my twenties.  I was not at all sure of what I wanted to  do in terms of a career in those days, and  I had so many other interests.  I'm sure  if I had had a child then, I would-have,  resented the child all of my life for the  very fact of it's having been born at an  inappropriate time.  I also want to mention that I took prenatal classes, and that I would recommends HEALTH  them to anyone planning to have a child.  JOAN: Me, too.  I'll second that.  CYNTHIA:  I took mine from the Vancouver  Childbirth Association. Husbands were  encouraged to attend and mine came along  with me.  I learned a lot about what can  happen during birth, as well as useful  exercises and breathing techniques to  use during pregnancy, all of which was  good preparation for the actual delivery.  I think it's good to try to involve the  father as much as possible so that he feels  a part of things right from the very beginning.  And I read alot on my own.  One book I  remember being particularly impressed with  was Sheila Kitzinger's The Experience of  Childbirth.  JOAN: As I said earlier, I had given alot  of thought to having a child through the  years.  It's just that the time had never  seemed right before. When I first got  pregnant, I was living in Halifax, a relatively alien territory for me.  I had  grown up in Vancouver, and most of my  friends were here, and my first thought    ^  was just to somehow get back here.  I knew  ^  that what lay ahead of me would be tough    |  going in many ways and that I would need    |-  the kind of emotional support that only  comes from old friends or family.  So I  bought a third-class ticket on the train  almost as soon as I found out I was pregnant, that is, at about six weeks.  KINESIS: Third class from Halifax to Vancouver means that you would be sitting up  all the way, for six days.- Were you worried about having a miscarriage?  JOAN: Yes I was.  But I managed to convince  the doctor that I had at at the time to give  me 5 mg.'s of valium for each night that I  would be on the train, to help me relax.  I told him that I thought it was alot better  than risking losing the baby.  KINESIS: ■ So you arrived safely in Vancouver  and went on welfare. What other preparations  did you make?  JOAN:  I informed my friends of what was  happening.  One of them let me stay in her  cabin in the woods for awhile to help me  save money. That was good for me anyway  because I had to chop wood and haul water  as a part of the necessities of life, and  I also did a fair amount of hiking while  I was out there just for enjoyment. So I  had pretty good muscle tone by the time the  baby was born.  But it was a bit lonely.  I came back to Vancouver at about the seventh month, and then I started attending  pre-natal classes. I learned quite a bit  there and also read a lot on my own. And  I spent a lot of time talking to my friends  about my fears around birthing.  Some of  them had children, and others didn't, but  they were all very comforting to me.  In  the last month I felt particularly apprehensive, and one friend suggested something  I never would have thought of myself: relaxing tea.  KINESIS:    How was the birthing experience?  'Did you have an easy birth?  CYNTHIA: Mine wasn't that easy.  It wasn't  extraordinarily difficult, either.  It was  just an average birth I guess.  But I'm  sure it would have been alot more difficult  if I hadn't had my husband, Maurice, at my  side. Maurice was there throughout, and  he was very comforting and supportive.  It  was a hospital birth.  I didn't want to  take any chances. But on the other hand,  I'd never been in a hospital before in my  life.  It wasn't exactly a relaxing atmosphere.  There was a problem - a fairly common problem, I'm told. My cervix didn't  dilate quickly enough.  Doctors don't like  you to push until the cervix is fully dilated - from eight to ten centimeters.  JOAN: Twelve of my friends came along  to give me emotional support.  Ten women and two men  MELANIE: Mine was a home birth—  mostly because I'm the type of person  who feels intimidated by large  bureaucratic institutions like hospitals,  So I felt a great urge to push and I experienced a great deal of pain in holding  back from doing just that.  The period  during which this sort of thing happens  is called the transition period.  For me  it was very long and painful - about four  and a half hours.  The entire labour was  about 12 hours, beginning at about one in  the morning.  I didn't get any sleep that  night, and you can imagine how exhausted  I was towards the end.  I had a woman ob-  stretician and our family doctor present  for the last five hours.  They were monitoring the baby's heartbeat with a Dompton  monitor.  Finally I was getting too tired  to push anymore and they decided for some  reason that the baby had to some soon.  So  they gave me an epidural anaesthetic so  that I wouldn't feel anything although I  was still awake.  They had to do an epis-  iotomy (an incision between the vagina and  the rectum) to make more room for the baby's  head to pass through, and it was necessary  to pull the baby's head out with forceps.  MELANIE: Mine was a home birth - mostly  because I'm the type of person who feels  intimidated by large bureaucratic institutions like hospitals. Some people feel  safer and more at ease with all the back  up at hand, I know, but I think that the  choice between a home or hospital birth  should be to a large extent, a question  of the personality of the woman, and where  she feels most at ease.  I guess mine was a pretty easy birth. Mind  you, I was prepared to go into the hospital  if there were any last-minute complications.  But I didn't expect any since I had been  thoroughly checked over by a doctor three  days before the delivery and had been given  a green light to do it at home.  Nevertheless, I had made arrangements with a doctor  at Grace hospital to be admitted there if  anything unexpected did come up.  I had a  car in good working order and its driver  at hand.  My two closest friends, Bob and Jannit,  had hoped to be at the birth, but Jannit  was out of town.  Bob was there though,  and was very supportive. Jacie, another  friend, was there, as well as a woman  doctor. And a midwife whom I had chosen  well ahead of time, and whom I saw weekly  during the last two months of my pregnancy.  The room was dimly-lit for the sake of relaxation.  I had though of having photos  taken during the birth, but then thought  that a flash going off might be disturbing  to' both myself and the baby, so I decided  against it.  The entire labour was only about five and  a half hours and the actual delivery was on  hands and knees.  This is a much better  position than the standard hospital position because it puts the force of gravity  in your favour. I was able to breastfeed  immediately and was overjoyed at the sight  of the child by my side during that first  few hours.  JOAN: Mine was a hospital birth, too. It  was at St. Paul's. Twelve of my friends  came along to give me emotional support;  ten women and two men.  KINESIS:    Twelve!    Isn't that rather a lot?  JOAN: Yes. At first the nurses wouldn't  let them all in. They would only allow  two of them in at a time.  The rest would  be standing in a huddle just outside the  delivery room doors.  Two of my friends  were coaching me in breathing - one had had  two children, and the other had never had  any. At one point, I lost control of  breathing and a nurse popped in to help.  Other than that, there were no nurses present even during the actual birth. We told  them we preferred not to have them there,  but that we would call them if we needed  them. They were very understanding and  cooperative.  It was a long labour, it seems  to me, but not difficult really. My doctor, a woman, arrived for the last couple  of hours, and at last all my friends were  allowed in.  I must add that they were all  very patient and diplomatic towards the  hospital staff which is probably what got  them in, in the end.  KINESIS:    Were you able to breastfeed at  birth?  CYNTHIA: No. I might have been too exhausted to try, anyway, but the fact is I  wasn't given the opportunity.  I was not  allowed to have the baby with me on the  delivery table.  I had a quick glance at  her and then they whisked her away. Even  after I was rested up, the nurses didn't  always bring the baby to be fed. It was  easier for them to leave the baby in the  nursery and just give her a bottle, I  suppose. It may have been partly because  of that, but whatever the reason, my milk  didn't come in fully until about the fourth  day.  But in the end, I was able to breastfeed for about nine months.  JOAN:  I was able to breastfeed immediately  but I didn't keep it up for long.  I find  breastfeeding quite draining.  The baby  use to wake up about every two hours during  the night and since I was alone it was  always me who had to wake up and feed him.  I was so over-tired that once I fell asleep  on top of him and woke up to the sound of  his screaming.  So then I decided that  breastfeeding during the night was too  dangerous. Another reason why I decided  to give it up was because it was too  expensive.  KINESIS:    Too expensive?  JOAN: Yes.  On welfare an expectant mother  or a nursing mother is entitled to an extra  $25 a month to buy the extra nutrition  the baby requires.  This amount is still  the same now as it was four years ago. It  was clearly inadequate then, so I can  imagine how inadequate it is now.  I simply  couldn't afford to eat well enough to be  sure I was giving him proper nutrition.  So I quit after three weeks.  KINESIS:     What about the post-partum period?  Do you think child-care arrangements are  connected to feeling over-tired and depressed?  CYNTHIA:  I remember feeling quite fatigued  for about the following six weeks after the  birth.  But it was a tired happy feeling.  And my husband Maurice was delighted at the  idea of having a child from the very beginning. He was more than willing to get up  and feed the baby during the night or to  help in any other way. We fully shared all  the responsibilities that having a child  entails.  MELANIE:  I remember feeling quite tired  for a long time after Jess was born. Maybe for the next couple of years. And it  wasn't for lack of people to help me out  with him.  Three of us had agreed in advance to share equally all of the responsibilities of parenting.  In spite of the  forethought I had given to what was Involved in being a parent, and In spite of  the excellent support I got from Jannit and  Bob, I found having a child pretty disruptive after years of being autonomous.  I didn't feel fully centered again until  a couple of years later.  KINESIS:    Any afterthoughts or regrets now  that several years have passed?  JOAN:  Several of my friends deserted me  during that first year.  It's not that I  blame them, it's just that for one reason  or another they were taken away from me  by responsibilities elsewhere. It's not.  that I have any regrets, either.  I still  think he's the most beautiful child imag->  inable. It's just that I could have used  some time off.  MELANIE:  I don't have any regrets, although  it was quite an adjustment for all of us  to learn to be parents and to work at that  collectively.  It has worked out quite well,  1 all things considered.  Each of us has time,  =§ space and energy to follow through on our  ^ own projects and time to be with Jess, as  ^well.  For a child, too, I think it's better  to be exposed to a variety of parental influences, as long as those influences are  constant.  CYNTHIA:  I think a lot of people, particularly feminists and people on the left,  should sit down and do some really deep  thinking about what is wrong with having  children. Surely, the feminist movement  isn't against families per se.' A lot  of friends that Maurice and I had before  I became pregnant behaved as though we  had committed a sin against the left  by wanting to have the pleasure of this  basic human experience. Fortunately,  there were also those who shared our  joy and who were only too willing to  babysit or whatever, to relieve us of »  the burden of nucleardom. I think this  is one area - in the traditional left  in particular - where a lot more analysis  is required.  JOAN:  I have one final comment.  I think  too many women are overly idealistic about  the birthing experience. Everything has  to go like clockwork or they feel they've  failed as a woman.  It's the old business  of putting women on a pedestal because of  being mothers.  I enjoyed giving birth.  For me it was a beautiful sexual and sensual  experience.  But I don't feel it made me a  woman in any respect.  I don't feel anymore  a woman now than I was before I had my  child.* INTERNATIONAL  Rape victims subjected to  polygraph tests  The magazine Mother Jones reports that  feminists and civil libertarians in the  state of Washington are stunned by recent  revelations that rape victims in Yakima  County are routinely requested to submit  to polygraph tests.  At least 60 percent of the women who take  the tests fail them, the magazine reports.  Authorities have even pressed charges  against at least one woman for giving  false information to an officer on the  basis of her test results.  Mother Jones quotes County rape relief  coordinator Cheryl Ficek as charging that  the prospect of taking a lie detector  test is an added indignity that discourages rape victims from reporting attacks.  Authorities in that county already estimate that nine out of ten rapes go unreported.  Ficek, along with a county prosector, has  challenged the test's high failure rate,  claiming that genuine victims are doubly  traumatized when they learn they have  not passed.  Said Ficek, "Most women just  crawl home after flunking, they're so  humiliated."  Ficek reports a case in which a victim  who thought she knew the identity of her  attackers requested that the suspect also  be given a lie detector test.  The authorities refused, however, saying  it would violate his constitutional rights.  In Canada, at least one police department  has begun using lie detectors for solving  crimes.  The Calgary Police Department  sent one of its staff to the United States  for a four-day course in how to use the  test, according to the CBC.

"But a three-year-old child in a foster  home could divorce his (sic) natural  parents if they no longer show any interest in him.

(UPI info)  Changes in approaches to  breast cancer  A U.S. Cancer Institute conference on  treatment of breast cancer this June reached  consensus on two of the most important  issues in treatment of the disease.  The first agreement was that there should  be a time lapse between a positive biopsy  and surgical treatment. Currently, most  surgeons amputate immediately if a biopsy  is positive. So, each year 600,000 women  in the U.S. are wheeled into the operating  room for a diagnosis not knowing whether  they will wake up with one breast or two.  Waiting for surgery will allow time for a  more accurate study of the biopsy, lessening the frequency of misdiagnosis. Separation of diagnosis from treatment will  also enable women to participate in the  choice of treatment for their disease.  The panel also agreed that the standard  Halstead radical mastectomy - removal of  the breast tissue, nodes in the armpit,  and large and small chest muscles - should  no longer be the treatment of choice for  local breast cancer. Available alternatives include less mutilating surgery and  radiation therapy. Scientific evidence  is accumulating that survival and recurrence rates are virtually identical whichever of several treatment strategies is  used.  These recommendations will be sent to all  Texan fetus-snatchers challenged  A pregnant women, whose efforts to get  abortion referral information resulted in  a court appointing a guardian for her  fetus is the focus of a federal suit challenging the constitutionality of the guardianship laws of the state of Texas.  The American Civil Liberties Union Tuesday  added the "Jane Doe" case to an earlier  suit filed on behalf of "Jane Woe". The  original suit contended Jane V/oe was afraid  she would be unable to obtain an abortion  because the courts might name a guardian  for her unborn child.  The ACLU suit attacked the guardianship  laws as generally unconstitutional, alleging that a judge may issue temporary guardianship without holding a hearing, without  receiving any evidence, without giving •  notice to the person for whom guardianship  is sought, and without the person being  represented by a lawyer.  Harris county Probate Judge Bill Bear last  week granted Eileen Brady guardianship of  the Jane Doe fetus.  Afterwards, she filed suit before state  District Judge William Kilgarlin seeking  to stop Jane Doe, who is 10 weeks pregnant,  from having an abortion. Kilgarlin refused  to issue a temporary restraining order,  but has scheduled a hearing on the suit  today.  In a sworn statement accompanying the suit,  Jane Doe said that on August 31 she called  the Abortion Abuse Advice and Information  Service to find out "where I might secure  a safe abortion". She said she was told  she would receive abortion clinic information through the mail.  "I have reason to believe that the Abortion  Abuse Advice and Information Service disclosed my name to the persons who have  subjected me to (guardianship) litigation,"  her statement said.  ACLU lawyer Matthew Horowitz said the abortion information office was operated by a  so-called right-to-life group and identified Mrs. Brady as an anti-abortionist.

INTERNATIONAL  Kinesis 15  The Pope is unrepentant  about his sexism  "He's not in touch with the mood of Catholics in this country," said Sister Mary  Van Dyke, a Dominican nun, speaking of  Pope John Paul II.  When Pope John Paul toured the U.S. recently, he was faced with signs of protest as  well as signs of faith.  "Sexism is a sin -  repent", "Ordain women or stop baptizing  them", "The Vatican is not an equal opportunity employer" read signs at the White  House gates.  In Boston, a huge banner proclaiming in Polish,: "Your gay children love  you."  Women cannot be priests, says the Pope,  because God prefers men. Jesus indicated  this clearly when he chose his all-male  team of twelve disciples. This mandate for  an all-male clergy (and a celibate one) "is  not a statement about human rights", according to the pontiff, "nor an exclusion of  women from holiness and mission in the  church. Rather, this decision is an expression of the conviction of the church about  this particular dimension of the gift of  priesthood by which God has chosen to shepherd his flock."  On the final day of the Pope's visit, Sister  Mary Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, appealed  to the Pope to admit women to "all ministries of the church". While the pontiff  addressed the congregation, some 50 nuns  wearing blue arm-bands stood in protest.  What did the Pope think of all this? Not  much, apparently. Back at the Vatican, the  Pope, addressing crowds in St. Peter's  Square, reminded nuns that they should be  "sensible and illuminated mothers and never  irritated or embittered". Rather, he says,  they should be "courageous in a holy manner  j in following the voice of Christs's Vicar  (the Pope, that is) in a way that no nun  feels depressed or separated, even if she  may have erred".  as distinguished from homosexual orientation,  is morally wrong."  * On birth control: The pope condemned  "both the ideology of contraception and  contraceptive acts".  * On extramarital sex: "Sexual intercourse  is a moral and human good only within marriage. Outside marriage it is wrong."  The equation of sexuality with sin was all  too clear.  "There is no human progress  when everything conspires to give full  reign to the instincts of self-interest,  sex and power," he pontificated.  In an address to young people, the lineup was sex, drugs and violence.  "Faced  with problems and disappointments, many  people will try to escape...escape in  selfishness, escape in sexual pleasure,  escape in drugs, escape in violence..."  In today's society, the Pope sees "so many  disturbing tendencies and so much laxity  regarding the Christian view on sexuality  that have all one thing in common:  recourse to the concept of freedom to justify any behavior that is no longer consonant with the true moral order and teaching of the church".  Freedom, says John Paul, "can never be  construed without relation to the truth  as revealed by Jesus Christ," adding that  this truth is "especially relevant when  one considers the domain of human sexuality".  Do even Catholics believe him? An Associated Press-NBC News poll released on  the eve of the Pope's visit indicated that  66$ of Catholics polled are in favour of  "artificial" birth control; 63$ support  the right to divorce; 53$ think that priests  should be allowed to marry and 50$ favour  abortion on demand.  Meanwhile, a gay group from Turin, Italy,  has filed a libel suit against the Pope  for his statement on homosexuality while  in the U.S. such a statement, says the  group, "could only cause social, cultural  and economic damage to homosexuals throughout the world". A similar suit was dismissed a few years ago when the courts  ruled that the Pope, as the head of a  foreign state (Vatican City) cannot be  subject to Italian law.  C of E says it's OK for  clergy to be gay  A T-pnnrt, wht* oh ssvs t  While the Pope was preaching against  choice on abortion in Washington D.C,  October 7th, the Abortion Rights Movement of Women's Liberation (ARM) flew  a pro-choice message over the crown of  one million.  A plane towed a banner reading "Abortion  is a Woman's Right," which went right  over the Pope's head.  The Pope's trip through the U.S. was marked  by a series of pronouncements which can  only chill the hearts of feminists:  * On divorce:  "The covenant between a man  and a woman joined in Christian marriage  is as indissoluble and irrevocable as God's  love for his people."  * On abortion:  "To destroy these innocent  unborn children is an unspeakable crime."  * On gay sexuality:  "Homosexual activity..  A report which says that the Church of  England should openly acknowledge its  homosexual clergy, and which refutes "Biblical" objections to being gay, is creating  a stir throughout the'parishes of Britain.  The recommendations by a 13-member working  party of Anglican officials were published  mid-October.  Police tactics to get homosexuals to commit  illegal acts were deplored in the report  and condemned as harassment.  If the proposals are approved, Anglican  sources claim, the Church of England will  become the only Christian church to openly  condone homosexual clergy.  Posters drive rapist from  town  Posters and leaflets published by women in  the apartment and community of Washington  D.C, where one of them was attacked, drove  the rapist from town.  * He found his picture and description, in  both English and Spanish, and headed,  "Warning to Women in the Adams-Morgan  Community", posted on hundreds of trees,  walls, fences, and in store windows,  laundromats, restaurants and gas stations.  After the police, who has apprehended the  attacker in the woman's apartment, had let  him go without even fingerprinting, and  without any other media, the women created  their own.  Responses to the posters by store pro  prietors ranged from "we don't need his  kind in our community", to "I'd hate to  see my picture all over the community  like this". Women proprietors were eager  to warn other women and to watch out for  the man.  "We saw the situation change from the  attacker being out free to attack again  due to no media coverage and police protection of the man, to the opposite -  driving the attacker out of town, and I  am very sure inhibiting other men who  will now know there is a penalty-exposure.  "We could really feel the power of having  a press", said Julie Wall, one of the  Adams-Morgan women involved in the postering campaign. (Media Report)  Twenty thousand French  pro-choicers protest  France legalized abortion in 1974.  But  they did this for a five year period only.  And they attached a number of amendments  restricting women's access to abortions.  Now the five year period is up.  Some 20,000 women from throughout France  demonstrated in Paris the weekend of  October 6th to protest the failings of  the legislation and to demand genuine  reproductive freedom.  Before the November 1974 legislation,  complications from illegal abortions took  an average death toll of at least one  woman a day.  The death rate is down, but it still def-  ficult to find a public hospital willing  to perform an abortion. About one-  third of all public hospitals refuse to  do abortions. Doctors invoke a conscience clause in the law which allows  them to turn women away.  It is illegal to obtain an abortion after  the tenth week, and no form of public aid  can be used to pay for abortions.  So women are forced to go to private clinics, which will do abortions for more  than twice as much as the 800 francs  ($280 Canadian) charged by public hospitals.  As the protestors pointed out, this limits  abortions to those women who can succeed  in raising the necessary cash.  European sexists put on  their own carpet  Seven member countries of the European  Economic Community (EEC) are being sued  for sexual discrimination in industry.  The constitution of the EEC, the Treaty  of Rome, has two laws outlawing sexual  discrimination.  One guarantees women  the same pay as that earned by men for  the same work or work of equal value.  The second guarantees both sexes equal  working conditions as well as opportunities for training and promotion.  The charges against the countries are as  follows:  Britain is not enforcing the concept of  equal pay for equal work.  Nor is Denmark.  France, Belgium, and Luxembourg restrict  some pay allowances to employees defined  as "heads of households", traditionally,  a male category.  Holland excludes women in the public  sector from protection under Dutch equal  pay laws.  West Germany has failed to bring in federal legislation'on equal pay.  The offending governments have been directed by the commission to explain their  positions in the context of their treaty  obligations.  Infringement proceedings  against the seven has already begun.  (T.

The objectives of this group are: to provide  interpersonal support for the mothers, to  initiate political change within the feminist community and to provide the children with a framework by which they can  grow to know one another and share their  common experiences.  The "Lesbian Mother's Support Group" welcomes women within the community who are  interested in learning about and providing  support for lesbians with children and  those who wish to experience these, children in this lives.  Although childcare is necessary, in order  for the group to continue, this is also  an opportunity for you to contribute to  and assume responsibility for the children  within the lesbian community.

Feminists  resist this brainwashing, arguing that a  woman who is occupied with childcare has  little time or energy even to consider  the limited social options for meaningful  work other than mothering, much less to  engage in the difficult and protracted  struggle to force change. Unfortunately,  most of us seem to be unable to let go  completely of socially inculcated beliefs  about motherhood.

If you can provide us with that information there will be no problem."  No problem? Yet only a few months ago,  the Vancouver Sun battled in the Supreme  Court of Canada to win their case in the  "GATE" case. The Court upheld the right  of the Vancouver Sun to refuse to print  an ad submitted by GATE, advertising a  resource for homosexuals.  This precedent- setting decision stated  that a newspaper had the right to refuse  be involved with children. ■ Lesbian mothers, believing they freely chose to have  children (forgetting the social coercion  that influenced the choice), feel guilty  when they find they need help, and ask  for it timidly, as a personal favor, instead of expecting it as a natural outgrowth of their sisters' commitment to  Feminism.  Often, too, mothers find it  difficult to share the responsibility for  caring for their children, even when the  option to do so exists, because of the  loss of individual control that sharing  entails.  Our guilt and resentment result in loss  for all of us.  Those who are not biological mothers lose the chance to experience the real joys of helping a child  grow up.

She is approached by another woman who  expresses more than a casual interest in  her.  Jane admits she is a lesbian.  The  woman then calls her male companion who  proceeds to beat up Jane.  Two older gay men are sitting on a park  bench at,English Bay, and are called faggots by some young men who don't like them  being there.  Another man intervenes.  Nothing happens.  Violence for most of us is something that  we read and hear about, watch on television,  but rarely experience.- However, Don Hann,  spokesman for the Gay Alliance Towards  Equality, says, "Violence is a common  occurence in the lives of gay people."  There is a constant fear of either verbal  harassment or possible physical assault,  or a combination of both.  The most recent incident that has been  widely publicized is the beating at English Bay that took place during J-^.a  Festival week.  The situation involved two  gay young men who were beaten up by a group  of heterosexual men. Some gay individuals  believe that incident has been blown out  of proportion and feel that the heterosexual  population will view it as just another  excuse for the gays to get out and protest.  Shortly after Sea Festival week GATE (Gay  Alliance Toward Equality) organized a campaign to "create an awareness of anti-gay  violence.  The attacks are random and  irrational so therefore straight people  are also vulnerable," says Hann.  The group (GATE) sponsored a meeting at  the West End Community Centre (July 31,  1979) where victims of assault were invited to tell of their experiences.  GATE  also cited the ineffectiveness of police  protection as a major topic of debate.  It was resolved at the meeting that there  would be a protest rally to publicly air  the demand for better police protection  and to heighten public awareness of the  situation.  The rally had a turn out of approximately  400 people; supported by such groups as  AUCE, the Rights of Lesbians Subcommittee  of the B.C. Federation of Women, CUPW -  Vancouver local, Social Services Employee's Union - local two, and the Vancouver  Status of Women.  GATE spokesman, Don Hann, said, "The rally  indicated a strong sense of solidarity on  the issue." There is solidarity within  the gay community on the issue itself,  but on the matter of dealing with the iss-  sue there is a great deal of fragmentation.  The major point of disagreement is largely  over attitudes concerning police protection  and harassment.  "The general police and City Hall harassment over the last few years has created  a climate for violence. The police don't  recognize the minority status of gays, so  therefore don't recognize their vulnerability," says Don Hann.  A spokeswoman for'the Lesbian Information  Line (L.I.L.) said, "The police are set  up to protect the status quo." That's  their job, to protect the citizen who  fits into the norm."  The Society for Education, Action, Research  and Counselling on Homosexuality (SEARCH)  has been meeting informally with the Vancouver Police Department since late 1977.  These liason committee meetings are attended by Police Inspector Weibe, Aider-  woman Darlene Mazari, SEARCH representatives, Metropolitan Community Church,  Club owners, and recently Co-op radio.  The policy and SEARCH believe that the  liason committee has been beneficial to  both parties.  Gordon Lewis, spokesman  for SEARCH, says "The meetings have  helped to avoid certain situations where  there could have possibly been problems,  such as situations of supposed police  Harassment."  Darlene Marzari opined that the "liason has served a very quiet and useful  purpose. But it would be more useful if  it was better structured and a little  more formal. It might., then, give the  committee a little more creditability with  the police and the gay community."  GATE has not participated in the meetings  because they feel that "off the record  conversations don't get you anywhere.  The  police give the illusion of showing recognition of the problems of gay people but  haven't made any public statements showing  that they are willing to recognize them."  Inspector Wiebe stated, "There have been  no complaints of police harassment. There  is nothing going on in the English Bay area  that has to do with gays, no harassments  whatsoever.  If someone came to us with a  specific complaint, it would be looked  into. Anything else was worked out between  the police and SEARCH."  GATE has accused the police of not properly  investigating and following up on gay related assaults. However, Vancouver Lawyer,  tempted to intervene in the beating at  English Bay, felt it was important to go  public about his experience.  "If I hadn't  come forward no one really would have  known."  "Some peuple don't want to come forward  and report assaults because they do not  want to deal with the hassles involved  or the amount of time it takes.  There is  also some fear of the victim being  made to feel that he/she provoked the  incident," said Maingot.  The best defense is education, according  to most of the gay support organizations.  The spokeswoman for L.I.L. stated, "It's  not the act itself that has to be changed,  it's the attitudes precipitating the act.  This behavior is learned."  "The attitudes come down from above, which  gives the younger machos an unspoken permission to go out and commit such acts,"  says SEARCH spokesman, Gordon Lewis.  "Not being silent anymore is also a form  of defense," says L.I.L. spokeswoman.  "The violence that gay people experience  is nothing new. Women also have always  We are talking about it now. We aren *t going to put up  with it anymore  Richard Brail says, "The big problem with  assault cases, in general, is identity and  the apprehension of the person(s ).  The  identification has to be accurate."  "After the attack the victim can recognize  them. But if she/he doesn't see them again  or doesn't know where to find them, it can  be difficult to press charges."  John Mikulik, owner of a downtown gay club,  has no complaints against the police.  "Thi"  police have been excellent about the club.  They know we're here and respect us."  "Gay clubs generally police themselves. So  there are rarely any problems inside the  club. But in a public place the police  have to act as they would in any heterosexual situation. Straight or gay, it .  doesn't make any difference," said Mikulik.  Spokeswomen for the Rights of Lesbians Sub--  committee, Penny and Venge, say, "The. problem is what we as gay people should do  about the violence, not focus on what the  police are or are not doing.  It is important to be vocal, so that we don't become  invisible again, but the solidarity must  come from within."  Paul Maingot, one of the two men who at-  been vulnerable to assault. But we are  talking about it now, because we aren't  going to put up with it anymore."  Many see future repercussions for speaking  out.  "When people rebel, there is always  a backlash," saysX.I.L.  Gordon Lewis, SEARCH spokesman, said: "I  would like to see less violence against  all people, all minorities (women, ethnic  groups, and gays )."  "It is important, though, not to emphasize  our differences. We, as gay people, are  all threatened by the same thing and we  ■have to work on it together. These differences are resolvable," say the spokeswomen of the Rights of Lesbians Subcommittee.  L.I.L. supports this.  "It is only fair to  say that we don't agree on all counts,  but even so there is a sense of solidarity.  We are learning to rely on each other, and  must act as group."

But it's one of the  places where the play started.  OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS, by Nora Delahunt  Randall, goes on stage at the Dorothy  Somerset Studies at UBC from November  12 to 17.  The play is about the occupation of a  government building by activists involved  in daycare organizing. When the Vancouver offices of Manpower were occupied  in September 1975, Nora was there.  I've got to really stress that the people  walking around in the streets today are  not the people in my play,  Nora explains.  It's a play,  a fictional work,  not a  dramatized version of reality.  How did she come to write the play?  Nora left Makara early this spring, after  three years with the collective. At  Makara, says Nora, they'd come through  some incredibly hard times, and survived.  Instead of burn-out, Nora felt if somebody  had told the collective that Grouse Mountain  had to be moved to Surrey,   then we would  have seen it as a matter of figuring out how  to do it,  and have done it.  As with Makara, so with the play.  Throughout the writing and re-writing of  OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS, Nora says, she  had the support of a cast of thousands.  Moira Mulholland, a faculty member of UBC's  theatre department, was on the look-out  for a local work. Did Nora know of anything:  Well, there was Sharon Pollock's Lizzie  Borden (Lizzie was an assertive young  person who took an axe and gave her father  forty wacks. And when the job was safely  done, gave her mother forty-one). Nora  phoned Sharon Pollock to inquire about  the status of Lizzie. Sharon just happens  to direct the Playwrights' Colony at the  Banff Centre of the Fine Arts.  While they were on the phone, discussing  the fact that Lizzie Borden was about to  be produced elsewhere, Sharon out of the  blue asked Nora if she had anything she'd  like to bring to the month-long session  at the colony in May. It will be travel  fare, plus room and board, plus $200 a  week ,  It took Nora some time to tumble to the  fact that the $200 would be what they  would pay her, rather than the other way  She had one month to come up with a play.  I got on my bicycle and I peddled and  peddled, thinking about what I wanted  to do,  Nora recalls.  She came up with the idea of the occupation. Several characters occupy the  switchboard of the welfare offices in a  large government building. The issue -  Daycare.  Why daycare? Nora has lived with kids in  collectives and was involved with the  New School. I feel strongly about people  who don't have biological children being  an integral part of childrearing. I want  it for myself. I think it's a good idea.  On my good days,  I like kids.  That's all well and good, said Moira Mulholland.  But what about the play's focus?  So Nora gave the play a focus - mother and  daughter relationships.  In the switchboard  office, where most of the play's action  takes place, there are four women: Donna  (with a big heart and a big purse), a daycare organizer; Mary (who used to be in  daycare organizing but who has quit due  to burn-out); Mary's fourteen-year-old  daughter Carrie, and a young daycare  activist, Star.  During the occupation,  Donna's daughter is down on the street.  The situation begins like this:  Donna and Star have organized a noon-hour  picket outside the welfare office to protest changes in day-care policy. A group  of parents and workers have come down to  picket.  Donna has called up Mary, urging  her to come down too. Mary is reluctant  to get involved. She is going out to  lunch with her daughter Carrie, whom she  doesn't see very often because they don't  live together.  But she says yes, she'll  drop by.  There they all are on the picket line -  ("What do we want? Daycare. When do we  want it? Now!) when events escalate.  Star demands to see the minister, and  refuses to be put off by explanations  that he's not in the building. We'll  all just wait in the lobby until he  shows, she says.  Whereupon Donna marches into the switchboard, followed by Mary, with her daughter  Carrie tagging along.  DONNA (to startled switchboard operator)  Hi.   We're occupying this room until the  Which gives you, Nora says, an idea of  what Donna is like.  Dave also becomes unwittingly involved  in the switchboard occupation.  He's  entered the building from a side-door,  and, having seen the women marching into  the switchboard office, has tagged along.  He thinks that that must be where the  demo is.  Why put Dave in the play?  Well it's a demonstration,   says Nora,  adding that you always find people like  Dave at local demonstrations. He 's West  coast mellow,  a spacey jeweller from Mayne  Island.  Throughout the play, Dave knits. His  knitting-needles come in handy when the  occupiers eat some Chinese take-out.  After two-and-a-half days, they get negotiated out of the building by a leftist  lawyer.  Is the play a call to action? Is it  optimistic?  J think it's an optimistic play. It's  certainly got a lot of energy in it, a  lot of funny lines. I think its more a  celebration of activists than a call to  action.  Both at Banff and UBC, the play has been  worked upon by people outside the women's  movement. We asked Nora how it has been  received by actors and theatre people.  At Banff there was a lot of tension before my play was read.     How to deal with  a feminist playwright?    They were all  relieved to find that I'd actually written  a play.    They could relate to that.     One  actor thought I'd chosen the issue of  daycare as a parody - to send up real  demonstrations about real issues,   like  the Vietnam war.     It took him two or  three weeks to figure out that daycare  ■was not being seen as a trivial issue!  Some of the-actors thought I should develop the relationships within the play -  make Dave Mary's ex-lover,  for example.  It was interesting to me that it was  the women in the group who insisted that  it was sufficient to have the women  characters relating to the outside situation - the occupation itself.  OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS is for two audiences.  First, it's for us to celebrate who we  are and what we do.  Then it's for them.  I wanted to reach  people,  who,  when they hear about a demonstration on TV,  go YUK!    I wanted to  introduce them to the people who do that  sort of thing.    I wanted to start at the  moment where they are going YUK and show  them that these are real people.    They  could live next door.    I wanted to convince them,  not of the idea,  but of the  people.     That would make it harder for  them to separate us out,   to refuse to  relate.  I'm not a member of the theatre community,    Nora adds.     I've written a play  that can go places I can't.    It can tell  them about what all my crazy friends and  I have been doing for thes past ten years.

The Port Coquitlam women did it, and their  "Story of a Women's Centre" just published,  is an invaluable document of their process.  Funded by a grant from the Woman's Programs Department of the Secretary of State,  the book was written by two centre members,  Bev Le Francois and Helga Enns.  It all began, like so much began in the  early years of the seventies, with a consciousness-raising group. Seven women  made initial contact. Five were from  Coquitlam, one from Port Coquitlam and  one from Burnaby.  Enns writes, The Coquitlam consciousness  raising group had attended,  in the spring  of 1974,  a Women's Conference at Capilano  College.     There,  one of the members met  a friend she had not seen for several  years.     In the process of "catching up",  her friend told her that she was working  as co-ordinator of a women's centre in  Kamloops.     That summer she visited her  friend in Kamloops and saw the women 's  centre there.     "If Kamloops can have a  centre, " she said,   "Port Coquitlam can  have a centre". "  Fourteen months later, on May 25, 1975,  the Port Coquitlam Women's Centre opened.  They had gone from a group of seven to a  group of seventy.  As Enns points out, the building is    a  source of surprize and pleasure to the  women who played a part in the events that  led to the opening...they did not set out  to start a women's centre.     Similarly,  the  Vancouver Status of Women and the  YWCA Women 's Resource Centre,  which also  played a role,  did not expect to see a  centre here.    It was as if, almost inadvertently,  they dropped a pebble in a pool  of water and set ever-expanding ripples  in motion.       The CR group had led to a  speakers series, and the speakers series  had led to a committee to push for the  establishment of a centre.  The women on the committee had eyed the  vacant buildings in the area, and came  up with a gas station, a post office, and  the concession stand. They settled on  the last, because of its close prosimity  to bus routes.  Port Coquitlam council was successfully  lobbied, and agreed to pay heating and  utility bills, and to restore the glass  in the windows.  A building committee set out to change the  two rooms into three.  They soon found  out,  writes Enns, that they had more  than enough expertise.    Some had previously built furniture or helped build  their homes.     Women who had never used  power saws,  hammered a nail,  or worked  with insulation,   learned new skills and  did not find it too difficult.     Women can  still visualize one of the carpenters  wearing her long white graduation gloves  (the ones with a million pearl buttons)  retrieved from the back of her bottom  dresser drawer to protect her hands as  she worked with the insulation.  After tracing the events which brought  the centre into being, Story moves into  a detailed, systematic presentation of  every aspect of the centre's work.  The drop-in information service, consciousness-raising groups, volunteer  policy, structure and operation of the  centre, the library and the newsletter  are among topics covered.  The structure and operation of the centre,  is outlined step-by-step: bi-monthly  membership meetings and a steering committee of five which rotates a member  every three months. Who does what is  clear.  The section on volunteers at the centre  includes, verbatim, the entire volunteer  policy plus the babysitting policy, for  volunteers with young children. Read it,  and you'll know the details, right down  to where the children in the centre should  be playing during drop-in.  One on-going difficulty, especially in the  first year of the centre's life, was that  during drop-in times, centre regulars  appeared to form a clique.  "New drop-ins  felt excluded. There were complaints  from some that the centre was becoming a  "club", an intellectual "kaffee klatch"  and... frequent reassessment was needed."  There is a short chapter which deals with  conflicts.  The issue of abortion has  caused some difficulty.    Some women felt  very uncomfortable, when the Centre  addressed itself to this issue.    They  felt they could not volunteer at a Centre  that openly supported the individual's  posed for the Coquitlam area.  They are  lobbying the merchants to subsidize the  child-minding centre as a service to the  women with,young children who will be  doing their shopping at the mall ( a two-  level affair with parking for nearly  4,000 cars).  The final chapter of Story discusses the  centre's involvement with other feminist  organizations. It recalls their major  contribution to Women Rally for Action,  as publishers of Intercom, the rally's  organizational newsletter.  It appraises  Poco's role within the Fraser Valley's  Women's Coalition.  Withdrawal from BCFW  Topically, it also talks about Poco's  withdrawal from BCFW. At the 1978 convention, the North Shore Women's Centre  introduced a resolution which called  upon BCFW to declare that feminism  is "a political philosophy independent  from any known or named political party  i of choice in this matter,  writes  Le Francois.  Coquitlam Women's Emergency Crisis Shelter  was set up through the efforts of the women at the Port Coquitlam women's centre.  How the Poco women went about this may  prove to be of immediate use to women in  other areas who are engaged in the same  struggle.  Who gave them information? What did they  say to funding agents? What are the  legal twists and turns? Where did the  money come from and how much was it?  Who can be hit up to donate furniture?  Who dupported the applications to funding  agencies? How were those supportive  groups approached? What analysis was  used? Where did those statements of  philosophy come from? Story provides  the answers.  Patricia's Moving Pictures was another  special project of the women's centre.  Patricia Garner was married at eighteen  and had seven children (three biological,  four adopted). Her oldest child had  already left home and the youngest had  started school. ■Patricia says:      One  day I was vacuuming the rug like I had  been doing for over twenty years.    It  suddenly hit me.    It was like I had been  asleep for years and suddenly woke up.  I thought anyone can vacuum and is that  all I'm good for?    Everyone else in the  family was having fun and doing things  they enjoyed and they no longer really  needed me.    Suddenly I felt I was really  not a very important person.  Throughout the severe depression and  crisis which followed, Patricia turned  for support to the women at the centre..  Her experience is now the subject of a  National Film Board film by Bonnie Klien.  Child-minding at the mall  A current special project under way at  the centre is to set up a child-minding  centre in a huge shopping mall pro-  or system." That resolution was defeated, but the Port Coquitlam women were  in sympathy with it.  Story explains:  "Women from the Port  Coquitlam Area Women's Centre had three  major complaints about BCFW. One was  that BCFW did not initiate action, that  is it did not make enough public statements on women's issues or encourage  groups to work together.  The second was that the public image of  BCFW, as a group of angry, radical women,  did not fit for them and that this image  alienated women outside of the movement.  They realized that this image was fostered by the media, which focused on these  groups at rallies and parades, but they  also knew it harmed their cause.  A third complaint was that feminist women  were being excluded from participation  in BCFW by a narrow definition of feminism  and especially the association of feminism  with a particular political stance.  Eventually women at Port Coquitlam realized that their expectations of BCFW would  not be met."  Despite withdrawal from BCFW, Enns emphasizes, the women at the centre are still  supportive of the activities of other  feminists, and acknowledge the valuable  contribution made to the centre by such  BCFW members as Vancouver Rape Relief and  the Health Collective.  Port Coquitlam women's centre has now joined NAC (the National Action Council), a  group which lobbies at the federal level.  Story of a Women's Centre is direct about  specifics and philosophy. You can agree  or disagree with either. But because both  are presented with clarity, for once you'll  know why.

As active members of Rape Relief  who were involved in the discussions around  court accompaniment, we are dismayed and  angered by her irresponsible and slanderous article.  This issue is not one we take lightly at  all, and certainly not from the holier -  (or lefter) than thou stance, which is  suggested by her wording.  Ellen:  To start with, we think it would be useful  to quote our actual policy on this issue.  1. To create a sheet of questions in  order to find out why the woman wants to/  has involved the police, (in order for  us to have a full range of options, we have  to question ourselves and her deeply  enough to begin to see what the real needs  might be in the situation.) The purpose  of the question sheet was never intended  to be "used as part of a screening process against court appearances" nor will  women ever be required to fill out forms  and read "grim descriptions of what the  attacker will face inside".  2. To inform ourselves and the woman about  the full consequences (as we know them) to  herself and to the rapist of going to court.  To carefully inform her about the likelihood of obtaining what she's\saying she  needs from following the route that she  is choosing.  For instance, if she's afraid  to be alone, is calling the police really  going to meet that need? In the short  term? In the long term?  3. To state (a. to the woman, b. on pamphlets, c. at speaking engagements)  that we do -court accompaniment     nt  and/or alternative actions that will be  named (we need to force ourselves to help  her (the woman/us) to find ways to meet  the stated needs. Part of that is^taking  ourselves seriously enough to try things  that seem appropriate in the situation and  to label the things that we try actions  or alternatives.  Until we say those things  out loud (alternatives/action) we are NOT,  IN FACT, offering any Real choices, and  therefore police cannot be a choice.  We are developing alternatives  We interpret your sentence, "if we fail  to do anything...." in your last paragraph, to intimate that Rape Relief is  offering nothing apart from court accompaniment as a means ,to reclaiming our  power as women.  First, this- is not true;  we are developing alternatives that we  see as being far more effective as well  as being tailored to the woman's actual  needs in the situation, (as opposed to  court proceedings, which reflect the needs  of a capitalist society. )  Secondly, we question the validity of reclaiming our power by handing it over once  again, this time to the judicial system,  and allowing them to decide both our fate  and the rapist's.  Remember that in a rape  trial, you are the witness, not the victim,  and have little to say in the proceedings  and retaliation.  If as you say, that retaliation is not "reflective of our long  term goals or even a highly constructive  'Ģway of dealing with a crime against women",  then WHY ARE WE DOING IT? V  In answer to the charge of racism: we know  that rape crosses all race and class lines.  Special concessions for rapists on the  basis of their race or class are made only  by the judicial system, not us, but if by  our failure to oppose this or by ignoring  the consciences of racism and classism by  the courts, we continue to feed into that  oppression then we too, are guilty.  Racism  is NOT O.K. when we allow someone else to  practice it.  If as we believe, feminists  have a responsibility to oppose racism and  classism, then it would be contradictory to  say that we oppose the judicial system as  oppressive institution, except for rapists.  We are not, by our recognition of the system, supporting, identifying and empathizing with the rapist. You yourself say  that institutions do not benefit women so  it is difficult to understand how trying  to provide alternatives which would support  and empower women at the same time as  actively decrying violence, is against the  interests of women.  Women, whether we have been raped or not,  are not in need of protection from the  truth. It is patronizing to say that I,  as a poor rape victim, cannot understand  well thought-out analysis and it is untrue  to state that this analysis would act as  an added layer of guilt.  We did not create our oppressive legal  system, but if, by our decisions and our  actions we SUPPORT  it, then we must not  hide from that fact. A choice is not real  if only part of the information is avail- -  able, therefore the situation demands that  we provide that information. Nor does  this mean that we withdraw our support of  the woman and punish her for making  choices that are not ours.  It simply means  that we are honest with her and live what  we believe.  We share your hope that, "feminists working today will bring about a change so  radical that these kinds of institutions  will cease to exist." However, rescuing  women from the immediate trauma of rape  while simultaneously sheltering her and  ourselves from the realities of our racist,  sexist, classist society is merely a band-  aid solution.  Violence against women is an integral part  of the whole oppressive system which again  and again on every level reinforces and  encourages it'. Separating rape from these  institutions and attacking it in isolation  will not put an end to the oppression of  If it is approval of the community at large  that is desired by the woman considering  a rape trial, then we are both lying to  her if we say this is the way to get it  (if 1.8%  of reported rapes end in convictions, her chances of getting that approval are somewhat small), and reinforcing  her belief that the legal system is a good  judge of right and wrong.  If we are concerned with the image of the  woman's movement in the media, and hence  the public, let us remember-several things:  Feminists, in this case through Rape Relief speaking engagements and counselling,  reach the public by the thousands eabh  year.  This is the only form of public  education we can rely on, other than developing our own forms of media such as  Kinesis.  The capitalist media has ALWAYS  distorted our work and our views, has  always trivialized.us and.used quotes and  actions out of context to "prove" their  image of feminists and sex roles in general.  Trying to look good and thereby letting  ourselves bit by bit become watered down  and co-opted, is neither as effective a  way of improving our image or of achieving  our goals. We DO  oppose and offend them.  If we don't, we should ask ourselves what  are we doing wrong.  Rape is not just a women's problem. It  is a problem of our whole society and  cannot be eliminated by women alone. Men  have a responsibility to recognize the  ways in which they oppress women and to  change sexist attitudes and actions not  only in themselves but in other men as  well. By refusing to acknowledge men who  are working on changing their attitudes  we are negating the possibility of change  in men and dumping the whole problem back  in the hands of women.  Men do not and will not have a voice or  any involvement in the internal structure  of Rape Relief.  The only way that we  allow men to make the decisions of the  women's movement as a whole is when we  uphold those institutions which men  control by handing our power over to them.  The few men who are connected peripherally  with Rape Relief are involved in our mixed  Fund Raising Committee, a separate group  from Rape Relief whose sole function is to  raise funds for the House and wnose actions  are accountable to the Rape Relief Collective.  We want to stress again that there is no  coming revolution - this is it!  The politics we develop are based not on books  but on our own experiences, our own guts.  If we cannot apply them to our real lives  then they are politics not worth having.  When we speak our political ideas to a  woman who has called us, we are not shoving  rhetoric down her throat; we are answering  her questions with our truths and there is  no way for us to separate feminism from  truth.  It is a lie to pretend we do not  know the consequences of cur choices and  it is a lie to pretend that ignoring  those consequences is validating to her.  Ellen, you are right when you say we, as  feminists, must not work separately from  the woman's movement as a whole. We agree  that we have been too slow to publicize  our changes, but in these times, when our  funding sources threaten to reef us apart  from each other, in the divide and conquer  tradition, it is extremely damaging and  foolhardy to print such slander.  These  discussions are important - we must have  them.  It is irresponsible of you to misrepresent Us by quoting out of context,  by drawing conclusions without having  participated in the discussions.  It does not escape us that our funding  sources receive Kinesis.  Seems like  pretty dirty pool..... As you say Ellen,  "the anti-rape movement needs a feminist  approach with a clear objective;  To  eliminate rape wherever and however possible".  This cannot be done if we are  inconsistent in our analysis and do not  apply it to every situation, every struct-  ture.  It is not a choice between him and  her.  It is a choice between oppression  in any form and clear constancy in our  feminist approach to everything.  We must not sacrifice our beliefs to  effect our revenge: to do so is to behave as they do, and is self defeating.  No longer can it be "an eye for an eye".  To quote you one last time:  "Liberalism  is the enemy of all political movements...  we must learn who's side we're on and  stay there."  Casey & Johanna  Rape Relief Collective Members Kinesis November '79 21  Another Baragon  response  Re:  'To Court or Not_to Court' - Kinesis  September/October 1979  I left Vancouver Rape Relief one and a  half years ago because I could not agree  with the political direction it was  taking.  The issues were not so clear then  as the current resolution to withhold support of, or redirect, any woman who intends to take her assailant to court.  I  found Rape Relief's policies increasingly  reprehensible then and, by the tone of  E. Baragon's article, at the critical  states now.  This group is in no way held  accountable to the women's movement for  such actions that so obviously affect the  direction of the women's movement.  I fully support E. Baragon's efforts to  bring this matter to the movement's attention and am willing to participate in  further discussion around the issue.  Lee Stevens  ACROSS CANADA  Dear Kinesis:  I have been a subscriber to your paper for  the last year and have enjoyed your informational approach to womens' issues.  What has sparked my writing to you are two  articles in your Sept-Oct issue; "How to  say 'Peace' to a rapist and not survive"  and "Joan Baez dumps former allies, U.S.  revises myths about war".  Ellen Barragon in her article against nonviolent tactics against rape fails to see  that rape is both a sexist and a violent  crime, and is reinforced not only by societal attitudes towards women but also by  societal acceptance of violence.  In my  mind it is important to speak out, as Mary  Crane has, against both. While I understand that rape is not a simple issue with  simple solutions, it is my feeling that as  long as violence is accepted as a part of  society or as a reasonable response to  situations, we will not see an early end  to the problem of rape. It seems evident  to me that a non-violent person could not  be a rapist. I would go so far as to suggest to those involved in the women's movement that speaking out against violence in  general as opposed to just violence against  women would be a significant tactic in any  public action on the rape issue.  In Daphne Morrison's article on Joan Baez,  I find a critique written by someone who  is obviously unfamiliar with the woman  critiqued. Firstly, the article is mis-  titled as Joan Baez would never have considered herself an ally of the Viet Cong.  She is a true pacifist, who condemned the  war in Viet Nam as war, and spoke against  the violence on both sides. Secondly,  Ms. Baez is criticized for not speaking  out on human rights issues in North America .  For the last fifteen years (at least),  Joan Baez has been an outspoken proponent  on each of the issues mentioned. Violence,  conditions in prisons, injustice toward  minorities, the horrors of poverty, and  other violations of human rights.  She has  done this through appearances at benefits,  on nationally televised programs and in  the print media. This article fell short  of your usual standard of printing well  researched and documented articles.  I  submit that Joan Baez should be presented  as a model of one consistent with their  beliefs rather than criticized for her  beliefs.  Looking forard to future issues of Kinesis.  Jim Spinelli  Re: The Interview with Chris Williamson  and Jackie Robbins  The interview with Chris Williamson and  Jackie Robbins, published in the September/October edition of Kinesis, is a  transcription of a tape originally produced by Barb Newton in conjunction with  Theresa Stowe, who is a member of the  Tobique women sit down  for decent housing  The band council office on Tobique Reserve in New Brunswick has been occupied  again by women seeking decent housing.  After being flooded out of her shack in  a remote area of a campers' park, Sharon  Paul and another woman, Cheryl Bear, took  over the offices August 27.  According to Caroline Ennis, an organizer  of the Native Women's Walk last July,  Paul was living in a shack with her 20-  month old son.  She had no running water  and had to walk some distance to get it.  As a result of the occupation, Paul received a letter from the chief-in-council  saying they would begin building her a  house September 14 - the day after band  council elections.  "I think that's the only reason they gave  a house to Sharon," said Ennis.  "She  doesn't really trust them even though  it's in writing." Ennis said when reporters called the chief, he denied having given th£ letter to Paul.  Despite their five-day, 100 mile march  this summer, the women still have no idea  whether their demands are being acted on  by the federal government.  "From what we see at Tobique," Ennis said,  "not a blasted thing has happened." She  added that their chief is not the kind to  let the reserve know what he is' being told  by the department of Indian Affairs (DIA).  So, using funds left over from the march,  the women returned to Ottawa September 5  to meet with federal ministers and continue pressing their demands for equal  treatment with Indian men.  Ennis said a petition was circulated at  Tobique stating that women are discriminated against.  It was presented to the  federal Human Rights Commission.  She also said they would be releasing  correspondence women at Tobique had been  sending to the department of Indian  Affairs about their problems.  Pointing out that DIA sends letters of  complaint to the person being complained  about, Ennis said "There's no sense for  us to talk to DIA at all. We're sick  of the whole thing." From now on, she  said, they wanted to talk directly to  the minister, Jake Epp.  "After all that we went through this  summer, it's crazy that we have to keep  going back to Ottawa to find out what  the hell's going on." Ennis added.  Upstream  We've come part-way,  maybe  "In the first flush of enthusiasm for government intentions to improve the status  of women in Canada, we were over-optimistic  in our judgements," says Doris Anderson,  president of the Advisory Council on the  Status of Women (ACSW).  10 Years Later is a report just issued by  the ACSW which appraises the progress made  in the decade since the royal commission  on the status of women published its recommendations. -That was in 1970.  ACSW has found that of the 122 recommendations of the royal commission, 43 have been]  implemented, 53 partially implemented, and  24 not implemented at all.  The council,  which monitors only federal legislation,  did not evaluate the 45 recommendations  which come under provincial jurisdiction.  This might make you throw up  Benedictin is sold as a non-prescription  drug throughout Canada without any warning  that it might be hazardous.  An anti-nausea drug aimed at pregnant women  Benedictin is sold only on prescription in  the U.S. and Britain.  As a result of lobbying by the Consumers  Association of Canada, the drug was reformulated early this year, and one of its  three ingredients dropped..  The association  believed that the ingredient could lead to  birth defects.  Now Health and Welfare Minister David Combie  says that the federal government is investigating the safety of the new version  of Benedictin.  What have noses got to do  with birth control?  Not much until a Laval University researcher came up with a nasal spray  birth control device.  Research into the new sniff-em-up-  contraceptive is going on in about 20  North American centres and could result  in a marketable product in about four  or five years.  There's a catch however. Researchers-  don't yet know if the spray, which  would affect part of the brain which  activates the ovaries, has any side-  effects. The aim, says medical researchers, it to obtain a "safe, inexpensive and readily-administered  contraceptive." We can only hope so.  The research team is working on a spray  which would be used once a month in the  second half of a woman's cycle and  would cause menstruation to start one  or two days earlier than normal.  We're in good hands  The Human Rights Commission was a bit hurt  when VSW member Mercia Stickney hauled  them over the coals recently.  They replied,   "...during its tenure,   the  Commission has done quite a few things,  such as:  I.     Granting requests for exemptions to  the Human Rights Code."  Good work boys. Keep it up.

At  the time of the performance in Vancouver  last spring, Chris Williamson and Jackie  Robbins were contacted by Womanvision  and an interview was arranged.
