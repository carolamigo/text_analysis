MESSAGE TO MEMBERS  On June 24, at the beginning of debate  on her estimates, Provincial Secretary  Grace McCarthy announced that her  office was granting Vancouver Status  $75,000 for the 1976-77 fiscal year.  This is exactly the same amount that  we received from the Provincial Secretary last year, and about $30,000  less than we requested this year.  McCarthy's announcement followed an  intensive effort by members, executive and staff to secure a funding  commitment from her office. We have  a file folder full of copies df letters to her from our members. The  outpouring of member and public support for VSW must have had a great  effect on the government's decision.'  For everyone who wrote, we all deeply  appreciate your effort and support.  A delegation of staff and executive  members were in Victoria on June 24.  They visited government back benchers,  leaders of the opposition, and members  of the cabinet, demanding that they  discuss women's issues during the debate on the Provincial Secretary's  estimates and support VSW's grant  proposal. When the grant announcement  was made, some of them were still in  members' offices urging action. As  a result of their work, the legislat- -  ure spent a substantial period on  women's issues that day. Hansard shows  an amazing agreement that women's is  issues are important and that the  time has come to do something. (Translation to action is another matter.)  Even with the grant we still have  some problems. First, we cannot give  the staff a raise. They now earn $800  a month and we had hoped to raise  that to $864. Second, there are seven  people on staff and we do not have  enough money to pay seven people for  the entire year, nor to increase the  staff to eight, as we had planned.  We have applied to the City of Vancouver for additional funding and  are waiting for a reply.  Along with continuing our present  programs, the major task we want to  accomplish this year is an expansion  of our library, reference, and information services so that we can be  a better resource for women and women's groups throughout the province.  This is doubly important since the  Western Canadian Women's News Service  no longer exists.  We will explore every avenue we can  think of for ways to become less  dependent upon grants and a single  funding source. For this effort we  need the ideas and experiences of  all our members. I hope that you can  help as much with this effort as you  did with getting this year's Provincial Secretary grant.  - Nancy D. Conrod  President, VSW  HELP WANTED  SHARING THE WORK  Now that VSW has funding, we are  cheering (hurrah! hurrah!) and getting down to making plans for our work  priorities for this year. However,  six or seven staff can't do all the  work that has to be done — no matter  how much we work 24 hour days! We  need your help to make this a GREAT  (not just good) year.  We are in the process of identifying  and evaluating all the kinds of work  we do already, and want to start doing  in the coming year, and organizing  all that more efficeiently and effectively. One of our weaknesses in the  past has been our neglect of the possible volunteer help that lives out  there in our 850 members. We plan to  start correcting this, and in September hope to start many activities  such as workshops, study groups, research projects, volunteer committees,  etc. so that we can increase our  effectiveness in the community and  TRULY be a working organization of  hundreds.  But big jobs can't be done unless the  little jobs are done too. And so here  is a beginning 'ad' or 'column' on  what right now, August 1976, we could  use your help with. (Next month —  more I)  1. Human Rights Hearings. VSW receives  announcements, background material  and invitations for all Human Rights  cases held in the Lower Mainland. In  the past whoever of the staff was interested and free would go; however,  it is a perfect job for any VSW member. All it requires is reading the  background material, attending the  hearing to just listen and take notes,  reporting back to the VSW office, and  perhaps, if relevant, working on a  short article for KINESIS (with help  of staff, if ycu want). It's interesting — and important.  Up-coming Cases:  a. Issue: sex discrimination in   rate- of pay, and dismissal without reasonable cause. Female complainant against a credit reporting agency. Hearing is on Au^ jst  17 & 18, 1976, starting at 10  a.m. (Vancouver)  b. Issue: refusal to hire on  basis of age. Male complainant  against a cement company. Hearing is on September 13 & 14, 1976  starting at 9:30 a.m. (Burnaby)  Anyone interested?  2. An Office Organizing Project. We  have hundreds of files on issues,  groups, business, etc. We don't have,  however, any files on specific 'important people' like all MLAs, all MPs,  and other public individuals. We need  someone who would like to set this  up, labeling files, getting photographs, background information that  may be available, and refilling the  material we have on those individuals  which is currently under specific  issues or correspondence. Is there  someone out there who is itching to  set up a system such as this?  3. Producing the Feminist Resource  Materials Kit. We need to run off  another edition of this kit soon.  It involves typing stencils, running  them off the gestetner, and collating.  This is perhaps a three-day job. Talk  to Karen if this grabs you.  4o Updating and Reprinting the B.C.  Guide £o the Women's Movement. An-  other immediate need. It involves  phoning and writing organizations to  confirm their existence, addresses,  phone numbers, etc. Then typing of  stencils, running off, and collating.  Talk to Karen if interested.  5. Book Reviews. (See page 14 for  details)  6. ...and always we need phone answering! We can always use women who can  sit at the front desk and answer the  phone. It can also involve opening  the mail, watering the plants (!) and  greeting people who drop in for basic  information, i.e. copy of KINESIS,  just to chat, to find out what VSW  is, to ask for publications, etc.  Although the job is simple, it is  not that helpful if it's just a one-  shot affair. We are looking for people  who can commit themselves for a specific day on a fairly regular basis, i.e.  every Monday, and for at least a month  or more. Anyone interested? It's rather  fun and not too demanding. Dn May 17/76, Human Resources Minister  Bill Vander Zalm introduced legislation  which wipes out the Mincome and Handicapped Persons legislation and replaces  it with one all inclusive act called  the Guaranteed Available Income for  Need Act (GAIN). Upon first reading,  the Bill received no discussion as  is customary when a new Bill is introduced.  Second reading is supposed to  be a different story.  In this case  however the Gains Bill was one of  several pieces of legislation that was  slipped through the House while all of  the members of the opposition were  boycotting the session in protest over  a questionable speaker's ruling the  night before. Upon third reading,  the Bill received its first discussion  but in essence it was already a fait  accompli and it was proclaimed into  law the same day.  Vander Zalm has called his legislation  "the most progressive social services  legislation anywhere in Canada" and  said '"it will be the envy of every  province in Canada". Well, before we  can accept Mr. Vander Zalm's glowing  praise of his own legislation, we had  better take a very close look at the  Act. He claims the legislation will  greatly benefit the single parent  through a "substantial" increase in  the welfare rates and through the  extension of health benefits until  the persons can get back into the  swing of employment.  This sounds  great until the question is put:  What are the new rates? The answer  is they are in the regulations.  In  fact even upon a casual perusal of  the Act, the phrase "in accordance  with the regulations" appears so  often in cricical areas of the legislation that it is almost impossible  to consider the ramifications of some  sections without referring to the  regulations.We are told that the regulations will not be released until  October 1/76.  In' the meantime we  are asked to take the stated intentions  of Mr. Vander Zalm on faith.  But some of the additional "benefits"  we know about are:  the suspension of  the special needs allowance for persons  lacking basic necessities, the return  of the "assets test" for recipients of  Mincome, the inclusion of senior  citizens and handicapped persons in the  category of welfare recipients, the  designation of 175 places in B.C. that  are off limits to persons applying for  welfare, the inclusion of an unprecedented penalty for those who obtain  money or social services through false  representation which requires a repayment of double the amount of money  obtained in addition to a $2,000 fine  &/or 6 months in jail. Another benefit  is the section giving the Minister the  right to declare any person-who terminates employment for other than medical  reasons-ineligible for assistance. For  the single parent with children, there  are many valid reasons to leave work  which do not fit within a health problem.  Vander Zalm has also gone into the business of maintenance collection. Many  single parents (most are women) have  difficulty getting maintenance awards and  the amounts awarded are ridiculously low.  (In addition, when the courts award maintenance they give first consideration  to all the debts that the working parent  has, i.e. new house, car, sailboat,  shares in a company, before he/she is  required to meet their obligations to  their family.)  Furthermore, payments  are often irregular or impossible to  collect. Consequently, improvements  in the maintenance collection system  are long overdue. But, does Vander  Zalm provide any better methods? First  GAIN  of all much of what we wish to know is  in the regulations and as previously  stated they are not public yet.  However section 16 of  the Act sets out  several concepts  that are frightening  to behold:  Section 16(2)     Where  there  is an order  of  the court or agreement,   the minister  may,   as  a condition of  the payment of  income assistance or  the provision of  social services,  require an individual  to  assign  to  the Crown the  right  to  maintenance under  the order or agreement,   and  in that  case,   the amount  payable under  the order  or agreement  is  a debt  due  to  the  Crown.  16(4)    Where there is no court  order or agreement,   the Minister may  apply in the Provincial Court on behalf  of  and  in the name of  the  Crown,  and  obtain an order for maintenance by  the  person required by law to pay maintenance,   and  the amount due or accruing  "under  the order  is a debt due  to  the  Crown,   and  the order  shall provide  that  payment  be nade  to  the  court  for  disbursement  to  the Minister of Finance.  These sections allow    the Minister of  Human Resources  to require that anyone  who applies for either income assistance or ancillary social services,  such as day care or homemaker's  services,  assign all rights with respect  to maintenance over to the Crown.  Other services included under social  services are:     case work,   counselling,  assessment,   referral services,   residential and foster-nbme dare services  or any form of child care services,  occupational training,   etc.,   .   .   .  Just how high a price are we prepared to pay for a collection service?  To subrogate anyone's rights to the  Crown for whatever purposes is a  very serious undertaking.    This Act  removes  the single parents'  rights  to self-determination over  the use  of their maintenance payments and  it applies  irrespective of whatever  type of social service they receive.  We cannot examine the difference is  income in real terms  for the single  parent because the new rates are in  the regulations.     But another  question  remains:    will the $100 maintenance  exemption still be part of  the new  social assistance regulations?  Single-  parent families have in the past been  able to gain $100/mo.   in addition to  their welfare payments either through  the work of  the parent raising the  children,  or,   through the maintenance  payment of the parent living apart.  For single-parent families,   this extra  $100    is a crucial factor in basic  survival.     If the regulations do not  continue to provide this  exemption,  ALL maintenance payments awarded to  the single-parent will be remitted  directly to the Crown.     Consequently,  unless the new welfare rates are significantly higher than they now stand,  many single-parent families will in  fact be receiving less  that they do  at present.  For  example,   let us  take a look at one  single parent family on welfare:     a  woman living with a three_year old  child.    Very few places in Vancouver  take children and she is required  to  pay $276.50/mo.  rent for that privilege.       In Welfare,   she receives:  Basic Support: $150.00  Shelter: $120.00  Extra Shelter: $117.00  $387.00/mo.  Maintenance: +    $100.00  (this was her       \      $487.00/mo.  total award)  Her  expenses for  the month are:  Rent: $276.50  Food & Household  necessities: $110.00  B.C.  Hydro  &  B.C.  Tel $  25.00  $411.50/mo.  Welfare will only pay 75% of extra  rent required so that $39.50  in rent  must come off her $150/mo.  basic support.    From these figures it is obvious  that she could not maintain the minimal  standard of living for herself and her  daughter without  that extra $100/mo.   in  aiaintenance.    Only one part of  the  budget can be cut back:     food.       Items  not included in this budget are:    no  dry cleaning money,  no long distance  phone calls,  no books, magazines,  movies,  no hair-setting lotion,  no  art materials or hobbies,  no dancing  or  swimming lessons  for her  child,   no  ferry fares  to visit anyone,  no holidays,  no special items such as a present for a friend or a new dress for a  party.  Whether or not  the $100 main-;  tenance exemption will still be in  force,  another aspect of the Gains Act  concerns  those single-parents who are  receiving maintenance payments in  excess of  $100    and are uerely receiving  a supplement from human resources  to  make the amount liveable,  or,are  receiving ancillary services such as  day care.    According to the Gains Act,  all maintenance becomes a debt due to  and remitted to the Crown.     But: when  does the single-parent get their maintenance award returned to them after  they go off welfare?    Section 16(7)  contains another kicker:  The Minister of Finance shall pay periodically out of  the Consolidated  Revenue Fund  to  the individual  in respect of  whom money is paid under  this  section,  all money received on behalf of  that  individual or dependent  child under  this  section,   after deducting all money  paid or provided by  the Minister  for  income issistance or social services  for  that  individual or dependent child  after  the date of an assignment under  subsection   (2)   or an order under subsection  (4),   less such amount as may  be prescribed by the regulations.  The words of this section to note are:  "after deducting all money paid   .   .   .  for income assistance or social services   .   .   .  ".    The government collects  the maintenance payments and then  deducts all money paid out to the recipient via either income assistance  (this includes health services,i.e.  medical,  dental or optometrist)    and/  or social services.    Upon third reading  of  the Bill,   the last line "less  such  amount as may be prescribed by the  regulations" was added.    What does any  of  this mean—we don't know—it's in  the regulations.     But what it could  mean is that for every dollar or  social service received,maintenance  will be used to pay it back.       An interesting question is:how    will the  value of social services be calculated?  Will Mr. Vander Zalm publish a rate  table for the number of dollars/minute  of the social worker's  time in additior  to the assessed value of occupational  retraining,  day care,  special counselling,   etc.,   so -that single-parents  know what kind  of  a bill they are running up.    They can then calculate how  long it will take after they go off  welfare to repay their "debt  to the  Crown".  For  those in need who are fortunate  even to receive maintenance payments,  welfare could now become a long-term  loan with easy payment plans.       The  money is deducted at source and the  government takes it all.  - Lorri Rudland MAKARA is a totally enthralling  new magazine.  First intrigued  by its beautiful covers, my search  for more information revealed  that Makara's freshness extends  not only to its scope of material,  but to its production and editorial  policy as well.  It all started in January of 1974  when the Pacific Women's Graphic  Arts Co-op was formed in order to  give women with children an opportunity to gain training and  experience in graphic arts and  business.  Somewhat later the Ad  Company emerged, doing graphic  design, and in April of 1975 the  planning of Makara began.  (All  three of these still co-exist at  the same address—busy place).  Publishing had been a goal of the  original Co-op, and after the  decision to go ahead with the idea  had been made, nine months of  planning resulted in the first  issue which came out late last  year.  Makara is published bimonthly at this point, thus the  August-September 1976 issue will  be the fifth.  Thus far Makara is not a magazine  that can be pigeon-holed—the  flexible format allows for an  issue like #4 which was a 'Habitat  Special', as easily as it does for  one like the second issue, which  included poetry, articles on psychotherapy, dancer Maud Allen, an  interview with comedienne Valri  Bromfield, fiction by a 6% year  old girl as well as by adults, and  a photographic essay.  Other issues  have reproduced the work of Vancouver artists, and included book  reviews and political articles as  well.  The incredible variety of the  material published is in no way  disorganizing or disorienting—  quite the contrary.  It perhaps  reflects an adult's scope of  interest better than most magazines  which purport to be of "general  interest."  MAKARA?  Another unusual aspect of Makara  is that it is entirely produced  by women.  Co-operatively produced  by ten women^ who ^wrestled with the  problem of how to avoid hierarchical  structure during their planning of  the magazine. Their solution:  editorial teams of three look at  everything that is submitted, rather  than an editor editing fiction,  someone else looking at photographs  submitted, etc., with those left  over merely "doing the work". Each  team consists of a writer/editor,  a graphic artist, and a technical/  support staff person, two of whom  must agree on the approval of a  submission.  The two women I spoke to about Makara  stressed their interest in positive  images rather than negative ones,  particularly where women are concerned.  They are anxious to present pictures  of women doing things, without the  activity being branded as 'exceptional'.  Consequently, one kind of article  they are very interested in receiving  is stuff written by women involved  in something—whether it is occupation  or struggle.  So, if you have an article, send it to them; if you have  an idea, send them an outline.  They  are soliciting manuscripts of all types,  as well as art work and photography,  and do pay for any material that is  used.  Makara is well distributed, so you're  likely to see it at your corner drug  store or newstand if you haven't  already.  If you haven't seen it,  (and especially if you have), subscriptions are available at $6.00/yr.  Submissions and subscriptions should  be sent to Makara, 1011 Commercial Dr.  Vancouver, B.C.  The key phrase to mention in trying  to describe Makara, is, I think, as  they suggest, "by women for people".  It is both of those things, and as  such is a revolutionary and fascinating magazine.

UNETHICAL  The Vancouver Status of Women and the  Women's Health Collective are in the  process of investigating the issue of  doctors in Surrey double-billing for  performing abortions.  Double-billing  is a process whereby the actual fee  is covered through the patient's  health plan but in addition the doctor  charges an extra fee for performing  the abortion. In some cases it has  been claimed that doctors have charged  an additional fee of $65.00 to $75.00.  We request that any women who have  been double-billed for abortions (or  tubal ligations?) call the Status of  Women at 736-3746. We feel that  double-billing is an unethical practice  and we want to see that it is discontinued.  In order to bring pressure  upon the government to have this issue  investigated, we need to know how  widespread this practice is. All  calls will be completely confidential  and no names will be released unless  the woman herself wishes to make a  public statement. WOMEN   NEED INSURANCE  This is the age of women's liberation,  the age of equality and the death of  the term "weaker sex." That is why  there is no reason for women to have  only weak or inadequate plans for  their financial future. Now that we  are no longer "second class" citizens,  women should own insurance to protect  themselves and their loved ones —  just as men do.  Women should buy insurance protection  for the same reasons that men do. Women who are earning a living, have a  "Human Life Value" in the same way  that men do. This economic value is  the ability to produce income — income that is used to take care of the  economic problems of living. In addition to providing for today's requirements, they must accumulate property  which will cover these same economic  needs when their ability to earn an  income, ceases. Therefore, they have  three major protection requirements:  protecting their income with an income protecting disability insurance,  protecting their future with a retirement savings plan, and protecting their  responsibilities with a life insurance  policy.  Women earning an income, therefore,  face the same problems as men. However, there is a difference. Women,  in general, must accumulate more property than men, because women live  longer and their needs at retirement  will continue for a longer period of  time.  Today's woman falls into four intermingling facets, ranging from the  young single person, to the highly  qualified professional woman. Each  facet has protection needs.  The young single woman will benefit  from the flexibility provided by the  living guarantees of insurance. For  example, income protection, savings  toward future plans, or beginning  the security of a retirement income  at a very low investment rate.  The working wife's need for insurance  protection is extremely important. As  a contributor to the income of the  family ubit her potential worth is  astronomical, for it is the wife's  income in more than 65% of the homes  that brings the family over the  $20,000 a year mark. The need to protect the family against this loss is  obvious not only today but also at  retirement.  The woman on her own raising a family  has not only all the needs of the  young single person or the working  wife but the responsibilities of pro  tecting and maintaining all that a  family unit requires. She must protect her income, her financial obligations, as well as protect her children's futures in case of her early  demise.  The professional woman must be aware  of the fact that it is her professional skills that produce the capital  from which she derives her income and  her purchasing power, and recognize  that her ability to earn is of paramount importance to her. Therefore,  she must not only protect her assets  today, but also build to maintaining  this standard of living after retirement.  Women control 70% of the nation's  wealth, yet insurance protection on  their lives represents only 15% of  the total for the nation. Why? Lack  of insurance knowledge is no excuse  for by picking up your phone you can  receive the answers.  So give me a call and let's light a  candle in the darkness.  - Barb Gedroff  office 682-1641  home 738-1952  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE  INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN  The International Council of Women  held its 21st triennial assembly on  UBC Campus in last part of June.  The topic of the- conference was THE  CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE and Sunday  Service speaker Dr. Margaret Fulton,  Dean of Women, UBC, stated "I firmly  believe that at least part of the  reason our civilization faces total  destruction lies in the fact that  throughout our whole recorded history,  the.political power structure has been  male dominated and the decisions which  have shaped our present world have  heen made solely by men. Women have  for far too long kept to their passive  roles as the bearers of children and  the makers of homes, while men have  perfected their roles as hunters and  warriors and providers."  She continued,"...  Centuries of controlling the intuitive aspects of being, and a value system which puts  more stress on strength and power  than on vision or dreams, have left  us with the belief that men are more  able to make rational decisions than  women. As a result, aggressive male  chauvinism has brought the earth  planet to the edge of the abyss, but  salvation may yet be possible. A  great netr surge of energy is coming  into society from both women and young  people. Male authority and male aggression are being challenged as never  before in the history of the race. Many  men are confused and threatened by  this challenge coming from the new  voice of women, but many are respond  ing positively, recognizing that those  old heroic male values are no longer  valid.... Women have minds and they  are quite as capable as men at problem solving and at political decision  making.  Dr. Fulton warned that now that women  would finally be given an opportunity  to participate in an imaginative rebuilding of the world they must be  "very careful not to repeat male power  patterns....Women can be just as  cruel, ruthless and power hungry as  men, while many men have shown themselves to be as loving and tender as  women. What is needed is not an exchange of roles where one sex dominates  the other, but an equal'sharing in  the organizing of a new social world  order."  COFFEE   HOUSE  The Full Circle Coffee House has  been open and operating Friday  nights since May, at the New School,  3070 Commercial Drive (15th and Com.).  Full Circle is a Women's coffee  house, run by women for women.  Currently, it is the only licensed  gathering place exclusively for Women in Vancouver.  Weekly, there has been live entertainment by women artists, usually  feminist and folk music.  Admission is $1.00, and beer, cider,  coffee and food is available at reasonable cost.  Best of all, the proceeds do not go into the hands of  men.  Any money made is recycled  back into the coffee house, plus a  nominal rent goes to the New School  for the use of the facilities.  In order for the coffee house to be  successful, that is, to remain open,  the support of women is needed.  Women interested in providing entertainment should feel free to volunteer  their talents and time.  Women interested in collecting admissions, selling refreshments, or setting and clean  ing up, should come any Friday and  indicate their interest.  But, perhaps most important, for the coffee  house to remain open, we need women,  all women to attend.

Analyzes the use of neo-Malthusian  ideology of population control as a  smokescreen intended to divert  people's attention from the real  causes of poverty and unemployment.  Co-published by The Women's Press &  The Latin American Working Group.  256 pages, graphics, charts, case  studies. Available in August 1976. 6  We thought you'd like to know the  VSW Reference Library now consists  of:  a) reference files on feminist issues  from a to z (ask for our list)  b) VSW publications (materials we produce—ask for list)  c) other publications on sale at VSW  d) women's info desk with free takeaway leaflets, etc.  e) back issues of feminist newsletters  from across Canada  f) back issues of VSW newspaper KINESIS  g) growing collection of feminist  paperbacks (review copies)  h) audio-visual tapes of VSW TV show  Woman Alive—can be borrowed  Ask for a list of our reference files.  It is by no means complete but there  are hundreds of files —they fill a  four-drawer filing cabinet! Here's  an idea of what's in it: C.R., abortion, birth control, status of women  in Canada, daycare, sexism in education, ethnic women, women's health,  housework, IWY, men's liberation,  rape, women in politics, women in  sports, women and work, — all the  biggies! A couple of the files were  so big we had to break them up into  numerous smaller ones. We do have a  variety of files on a variety of less  popular but important feminist issues  like battered women, policewomen,  prison women, the family, high school  women, herstory, pensions, credit,  motherhood, pornography, prostitution,  religious feminism, union women, etc.  After weeding out our collection of MS.  MAGAZINES for the past several years  we found we had up to 3 copies of many  of the issues so we sent a boxload off  to Okalla women's prison.  Making up monthly reports of our services and activities for Provincial  Secretary can be a pain in the neck  but it can also reveal some interesting things. For instance, in the month  of June VSW received 30 requests, for  information from the reference library  (not including*,requests for VSW publications) . The requests came from  universities, resource centres, women's  centres, government departments,  students, community agencies, teachers,  members of the media, libraries; from  groups in Vancouver, Calgary, London,  Ottawa, Armstrong, Powell River, Oregon, Richmond, Victoria, Columbia,  Toronto, Houston, Nanaimo, Maple  Ridge, Kamloops.  Materials listed here are, or will  be, housed in the VSW Reference Library. Anyone is welcome to use the  files any week day between 9 a.m. &  5 p.m. It is hoped that by publishing  these lists of materials we can help  feminist groups outside Vancouver  develop their own reference libraries.  - Karen Richardson  * Available from Books for Organizers,  P.O.

WOMEN IN APPRENTICESHIPS  My name is Joy Langan. I am a journey-  person compositor ( a fancy name for  a printer). I started my apprenticeship in 1970 at age 27. I became a  journeyperson in 1974 at age 31. When  I applied for an apprenticeship, I  was a single parent on a low income.  So what? Why is that important? It's  important because I am now a trades-  person! I fought to get in! I fought  to get through! But I haven't forgotten what it was like to be on a clerk's  income, and to be paying day care,  and then when I became an apprentice,  to find day care was just that, and  wasn't available to me, a shift worker.  One does not forget those frustrations,  humiliations (subsidized day care),  and discouragements.  Here it is, almost seven years later,  and I sat down to do some research for  this article — and I'm frustrated and  discouraged all over again. For seven  years I've talked to women and encouraged them to get into the trades.  That's where the money is while you  learn and certainly that's where the  money is after you have your ticket.  There's a tremendous sense of pride  in mastering a trade, too.  I've talked to union representatives  in industries that have apprenticeships and they assure me —"we would  be delighted to have qualified women  in our apprenticeships."  Personnel at the apprentice training  branch of the department of labour  have advised me they have been encouraging women to serve apprenticeships.  A Manpower spokesperson was very adamant that no unrealistic barriers are  placed before women in qualifying for  pre-apprentice programs.  I ask you—why then when I talked to  the Research Department of the provincial department of labour did I get  statistics like this:  Ooctober 24, 1975.  "In B.C. out of 12,334 registered  apprentices, 11^485 are male; 497  are female and 352 are unknown.  (With the rider that most of the  unknowns are thought to be male)."  Hair of course is the "preoccupation"  for women in apprenticeships. Out of  31 apprentices in. barbering, 23 are  women. And out of 458 hairdressing  apprentices, 377 women. That, by the  way, takes care of 400 of the 497  women apprentices in all trades.  Where are women in the high-priced  apprenticships, where the big money  is? Let's have a look:  TRADE  MALE  FEMALE  Auto body repair 387 0  Bricklaying 207 0  Carpentry 1748 0  Industrial Electrical 481 0  Ironworker 119 0  Joinery(bench) 148 0  Lineman 163 0  Machinist 307 0  Millwright 678 0  Plumbing 507 0  Refrigeration 130 0  Sheet Metal 419 0  Steel Fabrication 203 0  One of the arguments I hear is, "Women just don't apply."I don't believe  it!  Women who have applied and not made  it are not particularly anxious to  talk about it. Nobody wants to talk  about failure — it hurts. Andj I  suspect, unless they actually get  onto the books as an apprentice,  there is no record of them having  applied.  What happens when women do enquire?  COUNSELLOR: "What trade are you interested in?"  WOMAN: "I don't know, I want to enquire about them all, and what is involved in them."  COUNSELLOR: "Well, baking perhaps?"  WOMAN: "No!"  COUNSELLOR: "You must have some idea  about what you want to do."  WOMAN: "I was curious about what  would be required in carpentry."  COUNSELLOR: "What area of carpentry?"  WOMAN: "Area?"  COUNSELLOR: "Yes, industrial carpentry,  home construction, or bench joinery?"  WOMAN: "Bench and joinery?"  COUNSELLOR: "Obviously, you have to  determine what you're interested in  before I can help you—and besides,  carpentry probably would not be your  cup of tea because it''s mostly outdoors, and dirty and heavy,etc.etc."  WOMAN: (at this point feels vaguely  out of place and is less and less  sure if an apprenticeship is what she  wants after all.)  COUNSELLOR: (convinced she certainly  isn't very highly motivated.)  PERPLEXED AND DISCOURAGED  If she is fortunate enough to get past  that initial go-around of an interview, perhaps she is perplexed and  discouraged when she is told she has  to find her own employer, and she must  attend trades school so many months of  the year, and the union will have to  accept her, etc.  The more time I spent these past few  days trying to update my information  on applying for apprenticeships, the  more discouraged and confused I became  and I've made it through the system.  I received a letter a couple of months  ago from a woman who tried and failed.  She was angry and frustrated. She  suggested one way I could find out  why there has been little progress  for women in apprenticeships would be  to ask women who have been hung up in  the process. She said, "it's probably  better to talk to women who have tried  it (applying), but not made it yet...  rather than talking to the exceptions  who have made it..."  HAVE YOU TRIED?  I'm asking! If you've tried, and failed, or if you've tried and made it,  write to me. Tell me where you bogged  down. Name names. If a counsellor has  hassled you, or intimidated you, been  unresponsive,or if you've come up to  blank walls with employers or unions,  tell me about it. That's the only way  we at the Federation can find out  where the wheels of bureaucracy are  grinding to a halt for women trying  to get into the trades. My address  is: Joy Langan, Chairperson, Committee  for Women's Rights, B.C. Federation  of Labour, 517 East Broadway, Vancouver, B.C.  One suggestion, if you are interested  in the "male" trades and don't really  know what you're best suited for, you  might be interested in a new program  sponsored by the Women's Bureau,  Department of Labour, 434-5761. The  course is given at Haney Education  Centre and during the eight weeks  you would be exposed to drafting,  sheet metal, welding, painting, carpentry, electricity and automotive  and you would complete a project in  each area.  In the meantime, I will make every  effort to help you if I can.  There is no doubt we have to fight  harder to get in, and harder to stay  in. It's not right, but it is a fact  of life in 1976. And, until many more  women are in apprenticeships, we will  have to continue to fight.  It isn't easy. But then who ever said  being a feminist, or fighting for our  rights was going to be easy?  - Joy Langan, Chairperson, B.C.

This was certainly no sterile hospital environment. Here the women  could boldly discuss their problems  with the doctors- without being either  economically ruined or treated as  an inferior.  The doctors could be seen darting around playing with the children one moment and struggling into  nis white coat with the children at  lis feet the very next.  When the  doctors have finished treating a  child's ear inflammation, for  example, they always take the  jpportunity to discuss contraception with the child's mother.  The increasingly conservation political climate which has arisen  in Portugal since the 25 November  has also made itself felt in the  People's Clinic.  Before Christmas  the fascist police, GNR, visited the  Clinic, searched the premises on  the pretext of looking for weapons.  Nothing but a provocation, they say  at the clinic.  The population  showed its supports for the clinic  with demonstrations during the  raid.  One no longer dares perform abortions at the clinic, but women  are given advice and instruction  as to where they can get an abor-  performed cheaply and with a minimum of risk. It has been difficult  to get people to work at the clinic  since the 25 November. Many are afraid.  Forty years of steel-grip fascism remains fresh in the minds of the people  and they do not yet know w~at degree  of tolerance t e present conservative  regime will show.  domestic workers' organize  "This is a revolutionary trade-union  and don't forget it," said Concecao  Romas, Chairman of the Domestic Workers Union (Epregado Syndicato do Ser-  vico domestico) when we met at the  occupied "Domestic Workers' House" .  in Lisbon.  "We have organized the daughters of  the very poorest in Portugal, and this  has shaken certain employers so much  that they have slipped up to the House  and tried to redress previous wrongs  so that they wouldn't get into any  -trouble."  Concecao Ramos is herself a domestic  worker and comes, like so many others,  from an isolated village in Portugal.  When the family's little plot of land  was not enough to support the whole  family any longer, the only way to  survive was to wait upon the upper-  class in return for food and a bed.  Many are sent away from home when  they are still children. The youngest  domestic workers are 9 years old.  Half are Illiterate  There are many factors which make it  difficult to reach and organize the  domestic workers. Most of them work  in families without any colleague to  get support from, left entirely to  the whims of their employers and without any law or contract as help. The  lack of education is perhaps the most  serious problem. At least half of the  CONCECAO RAMOS, Chairperson of the Domestic  Workers' Union, was herself sent out as a  young girl to serve the ruling class for  food and a bed.  domestic workers are illiterate, which  means that in practice the union's  struggle to raise the political awareness among the domestic workers has  to begin with literacy programs.  There is another union for domestic  workers. It is run by the Catholic  Church and the reactionary party PPD.  It is this trade union and not  Concecao's revolutionary syndicate  which is recognized by the government  and thereby attain the right to negotiate wage agreements.  Frightened the Employers  Even though the Syndicate is not recognized by the government it has succeeded in earning a certain amount of respect among some of the employers.  Many of them were.afraid when they got  to hear of the domestic workers'  revolutionary union and came up to  the "House" to find out what they were  to do if they didn't want to get into  hot water. The union has managed to  raise the wages for some women. There  are examples of how they have managed  to attain an increase in wages from  300 escudos a month to 3000 a month.  The union has fixed the minimum wage  level at 20 escudos an hour with food  and 25 escudos an hour without food.  However many are still forced to work  for 6 escudos an hour.  (Ed. note: at present $3.11 Canadian  will buy 100 Portugese escudos).  "The most important thing is not only  the salary," said Concecao. "The most  important thing is to improve the  employment and working conditions and  to create job security."  The Syndicate today organizes about  5000 domestic workers — a figure 9  which is steadily growing — of a  total of 100,000 domestic workers in  Portugal. There are actually a few  men in the syndicate.  "But," Concecao said with a laugh,  "they first came when we had already  got going."  Occupation of the House  When the Syndicate was formed, Con-  caceo and other domestic workers a  large house owned by the Department  of Finance in central Lisbon. The  house is in bad condition, there is  no electricity and they have not had  enough money to repair it.  They occuoied the house not only to  use it as a headquarters for the syndicate, but also to give those domestic  workers who had got the sack for  "cheek" for example, a place to live  in the house. They wanted to learn  how to live collectively, study together and school themselves politically. At the moment 20 women live in  the collective.  "It has not been easy to create a  socialist collective," said Concecao.  "Many of the girls come straight from  the country which creates a lot of  problems. We have also been too individualistic."  Changing the Men  Rather than prepare meals and wait  upon the bourgoisie and their families  we will prepare food for ourselves  and other workers, thought the domestic  workers and they started a restaurant  The occupied DOMESTIC WORKERS' HOUSE  houses many activities: trade union,  and political schooling, a commune,  'restaurant' for the people, literacy courses, and soon a day care  centre for the workers' children.  in the house. This also gives a job  to domestic workers who have lost  theirs.  At lunchtime about a hundred workers  pour in to get a hearty meal at cost  price. The women have really succeeded  in bringing up the men and got them  to forget their male "privileges".  They all fetched their food and plate  in the kitchen, carefully cleared the  table afterwards, and, without exception, wiped the tables and carried  the dishes to the kitchen. In the  kitchen some of the workers stood and  did the washing up while the women  portioned out food to the next group  of workers.  jy j" " The house is large and the girls have  I-i^a surplus of initiative.

I Uncertain Future  % It has been more difficult since the  I 25 November, when the Left was out-  ajmaneouvred. The prospects of being  recognized by the continually hardening reactionary government are fading.  'I It naturallu prefers the Church's  I trade union which understands the  1 necessity of keeping the domestic  workers in their place under their  masters.  The Syndicate has now nearly no  channels left by which it needs to  reach its workers. Earlier the worker-  run newspaper "Republica" and the  radio station "Radio Renaissance"  gave space and support to the domestic  workers. Especially the radio transmissions were of importance, when one  remembers that so many of the domestic  workers are illiterate. But now the  Editor of "Republica" has got his  newspaper back and Radio Renaissance's  voice has become that of the Church  and the Reaction.  But the struggle will continue ("a  luta continua") declared Concecao —  to build up a socialist Portugal  together with the men, and, naturally,  to abolish the whole domestic worker  profession and liberate our energies  for more important activities.

NOW Visits  I was pleased to chat with Norman  Rock, a representative of the  Minneapolis chapter of the National  Organization for Women, on July 20.  Norman is a roving reporter with the  local NOW newsletter, who recently  visited Winnipeg Women's Centre where  he was encouraged to meet with VSW.  Minneapolis NOW has some 300 members,  a number of which are male, unlike  some NOW chapters. NOW is mainly involved in political lobbying and  publicity around women's issues  rather than service-oriented projects  and each chapter raises its own  funds.  Like VSW, NOW has its own difficulties in getting members motivated and  this is especially important since  NOW has no paid staff. NOW is not supported by government grants nor does  it receive much in the way of foundation grants. Mr. Rock says the local  NOW in his area has recently been  promoting the Equal Rights Amendment  (ERA), affirmative action at Sears  Roebuck(we should try Simpsons, Eat-  ons and the Bay), as well as integrating women into sports at school through  Title IX,and pro-abortion campaigning.  Natch we filled him in on the history,  objectives and activities of VSW as  well as the women's in B.C. and Canada generally, and of course the Women's Rally for Action. It's always  great to hear from people belonging  to distant status of women groups.  Thanks for dropping in Norman. We're  looking forward to seeing your write-  up in the Minneapolis NOW newsletter.  -Karen Richardson 10  letter  lobby  MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY LAWS: RIPE FOR  CHANGE - Joan Wallace  There is a time for everything, and  one of the best times to lobby a  government is when they are already  under pressure from other sources to  change laws.  That's why it is important that we all  write "one more time" about the perennial subject of matrimonial property  laws.  The Social Credit government may, or  may not, have an interest in changing  these laws. No one has said. But they  are under some pressure right now from  federal justice minister Ron Basford  who, at a June meeting in Richmond  of attorneys general from all ten  provinces, urged that all provincial  governments press forward with reform  of matrimonial property laws which  reflect the concept of marriage as  a partnership of equals.  Matrimonial property laws are a provincial matter, but the federal government  is interested because divorce is under  federal jurisdiction and they would  like to develop uniformity in matrimonial property laws among all provinces.  Your letters should be written to your  provincial .MLA, but it is important  that copies go to Garde Gardom, Attorney General, Parliament Buildings,  Victoria, and to Justice Minister Ron  Basford, House of Commons, Ottawa.  Try sending a copy to the editor of  your local paper for the letters to  the editor column too.  Here is a sample letter, but feel free  to use as much or as little of it as  you like. The last sentence, asking  for your MLA's views on this topic  will force him, or her, to think  about the issue.  Good luck!  Name of MLA  Parliament Buildings  Victoria, B.C.  The equal division of matrimonial  property has been an important issue  to Canadian women ever since the 1973  Supreme Court decision in the case  of Irene Murdoch provided a dramatic  illustration of the injustices inher-  ant in our present matrimonial property  laws.  Lawyers and legislators have been  talking for more than ten years about  changing these laws and I believe that  the time for action has come.  In British Columbia, the Berger Commission report makes some excellent  recommendations for joint ownership  and joint management of matrimonial  property.  I would like to urge that legislation,  based on this report, be introduced  at the next session of the legislature.  I will look forward to hearing your  views on this suggestion.  Sincerely,  Also see #2. in UNDONE this page.

The first session of this government  is over and although we have seen more  positive discussion on women's issues  and women's rights, we still have no  positive legislation enacted. If we  mobilized all the support we already  have for these issues we would have  a good chance at success in the next  session. WE MUST ORGANIZE AND SHOW  OUR NUMBERS.  1. CHANGE OF NAME BILL #34.' Intro~  duced as a private member's bill by  Rosemary Brown on March 30/76. There  has been a promise by Robert McClelland  Minister of Health (he's responsible  for Vital Statistics) to look into it  — and in the fall perhaps come forward with a government bill. To ensure  this doesn't get delayed write letters  to Mr. McClelland expressing your  support of the Berger Commission recommendations (Report #11), and of Rosemary Brown's Bill 34. Please send  copies to (if you have enough carbons!)  Rosemary Brown, your own MLA, to  Standing Committee on Standing Orders  and Private Bills, and Standing Committee on Health, Education and Human  Resources, and to the leader of your/  or all parties...and to us at VSW!  IT IS TIME WE HAD FULL AND EQUAL RIGHTS  OVER THE CHOICE OF OUR OWN NAMES!  (For a copy of the Berger Commission  recommendations write to Queen's Printer, Legislative Bldg. Victoria, B.C.  ($1). For a copy of Rosemary Brown's  Bill 34 write to same.)  2. COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY BILL #39. .  Introduced as a private members bill  by Rosemary Brown on May 3/76. The  Attorney-General has not committed  himself yet to the government introduction of this legislation. Because  it is seen as;controversial legislation, it is unlikely that we will see  government action on this, unless they  get a lot of public pressure to do so.  However, scattered MLA support exists  UNDONE  on both sides of the Legislature —  for example, Pat Jordan in the Social  Credit benches is one very strong  supporter. Please write letters in  support of this bill (and of the Berger  Commission recommendations)  (Report #6) to Garde Gardom, Attorney-  General of B.C.. Also copies can go  to (please!) Rosemary Brown, your own  MLA, leader of your/or all parties,  Pat Jordan, Standing Committee on  Standing Orders and Private Bills,  and Standing Committee on Labour and  Justice, and ... to VSW.  WOMEN WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEALT A  POOR DEAL IN MARRIAGE UNTIL WE GET  OUR EQUAL RIGHTS TO PROPERTY AND  ASSETS THROUGH COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY  LEGISLATION.  (Get the Bill and the Berger Report  from- the Queens Printer.)  3. FARM AND DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL # 84.  Introduced by Rosemary Brown on June  23/76. .It is criminal that there are  workers in our province who ace not  even ensured the basic minimum of  protective legislation like minimum  wage, rights to holidays, rights to  Worker's Compensation, hours of work,  etc.  This bill is to end the exclusion of farm and domestic workers from  all minimal labour standards legislation. Because this group of people  (largely women/and or immigrants)  constitute a cheap labour pool, there  is much reluctance to move on this —  for fear of the "disapproval" of the  employers of these workers. To show  your support for this legislation,  please write to Allan Williams, Minister of Labour, Rosemary Brown, your  own MLA, leaders of parties, Standing  Committee on Standing Orders and Private Bills, Standing Committee on Labour  and Justice,and VSW.  4. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.  Questions have been asked of Grace  McCarthy as to what happened to the  Equal Employment Opportunities committee in her department and the same  questions have heen asked of the  Attorney-General. Nothing seems to  be happening. We expect a re-introduction of a bill on Affirmative Action  by Rosemary Brown this fall — but  unless we show our support it will go  without serious consideration for the  3rd or 4th time. Please write to press  for the enactment of an Affirmative  Action Bill and EEO programmes in all  departments of the government.  NOT UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THE  INITIATIVE CAN WE HOPE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO  INSTITUTE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMMES.  Write to Rosemary Brown, your own MLA,  party leaders, Minister of Labour,  Attorney-General, and to VSW.  - Johanna den Hertog  NEWS  RANCHWOMEN  VSW member Ruth Patchett of the  Circle V Ranch in the northern interior of B.C. writes that she and  two other women (Betty Monroe and  Anne Miquor) attended the B.C.  Cattlemen's Convention in Fort St.  John as representatives of the Punch  Punchaw Livestock Association. Anne  Miquor became a director and is the  only woman on the directorship ~  a position she also held last year. HANSARD, JUNE 24. 1976  On June 24, 1976 the Vancouver Status  of Women was in Victoria to lobby for  our funding. By happy coincidence,  that very afternoon the Provincial  Secretary's estimates were presented  to the House for debate. Aside from  the announcement of the $75,000 grant  for VSW, all 2\  hours of debate on  the Provincial Secretary's Department  that afternoon was devoted to women's  Some excerpts:  Hon. G.M. McCarthy (SC): ...It is my  pleasure to announce...the $75,000  grant which is the continuation of  the grant that the Vancouver Status of  Women had last year....  Unfortunately Mr. Chairman, in the  debate that will follow I appreciate  that all members of the House and  certainly members of the public will  want more money for various programmes.  ...unfortunately we have not been able  to give more money...the amount of  money that was left for us to work  with was very much less than the previous government had in their first  term of office.  Ms. R. Brown (NDP): ...Although I am  glad that they (VSW) have received  $75,000 from the provincial government  I am really very, very disappointed  that the grant allotted to them did  not come closer to the request which  they put in.  ...in last year's budget there were  $200,000 budgeted for the Office of  the Co-ordinator of the Status of  Women for the province. That office  has now been terminated. It had been  my hope, however, that     $200,000  would have reappeared somewhere else  in the Provincial Secretary's budget...,  ...for the most part, the 200 women's  groups around the province are still  totally and completely dependent on  either public funding or government  , funding...I think it's important that  the Provincial Secretary outline for  us her criteria and the machinery  which she will be using to deal with  all these requests for funding....  ...what kind of intra-governmental  network do you have to deal with the  problems that are brought to your  attention surrounding the area of women?  ...I want to talk about the whole  issue of equal employment opportunities that you are responsible for...  A committee was set up by the previous  government -- what has happened to  that committee?  ...I would like to hear from you on  the whole issue of affirmative action  ....If I can take press reports Seriously, you said that women can achieve  anything they want through this government as long as they are serious  about it. (Interjection from the floor)  You were misquoted were you? In any  event, I think I actually have the  clipping here. What I am really hoping is that what you were doing at  this time was revealing some government policy in this area.  ...there are a couple of other serious  things I wonder if you're looking at,  and that's the whole business of women  in prisons. There was funding last  year for a programme...(of) preemploy-  ment training for women in Oakalla.  I'm wondering what happened to that  particular programme.  ii  HANSARD  ...I hope that the realignment of the  interest in women's concerns will  appear very soon through the Provincial  Secretary's department....  Johanna den Hertog  Mr. Gibson (Lib): ...One of the most  difficult things for governments is,  in a sense, to buy the bullets that  outside organizations are going to  shoot at them. When you fund outside  groups that do have the job of representing the interests of particular  groups of people in society you have  to accept the fact that if they do  their jobs well, they are from time  to time going to make things uncomfortable for governments. But at the same  time they will be helping governments  do their basic job which is to make  society run better.... So,...I am  very glad she made this grant on that  account. I hope the government will  continue to have the courage to go  along that route.  ...I hope and trust, Mr. Chairman,  that next year's funding will be expanded. I would apply this to the  funding of all women's organizations,  not just VSW.  ...Mr. Premier, who just came in...I've  asked the Provincial Secretary to represent to you that there should be  some kind of women's office in the  government—probably reporting to you  —which would be constantly seized of  the advancement of women's rights in  the public service of British Columbia....  ...the women's movement is unquestionably the most important movement in  human affairs, at least in North America, in the second half of this  century.  Mr. S. Wallace(P.C): ...that $75,000  grant is one of the best deals this  government has made in a long time....  ...It's such an enormous issue, the  whole question of trying to correct  some of the archaic practices in our  society regarding women.... But, education, Mr. Chairman, is certainly  the key.  ...the principle of equal pay for  work of equal value is so fundamentally just and right that I don't think  it is a debatable issue. The issue is  how we go about implementing that.  Goodness knows, the best place to start  would be at the largest employer in  the province, and that's the provincial government.  Mrs. E.E. Dailly(NDP): ...whenever  any debates took place on women back  in 1967, right through I'd say to the  beginning of the 1970s in this House,  the whole atmosphere in this legislature was entirely different...if any of  us stood up to talk about women at that  time, we were greeted with laughter  and cynicism from many of our male  colleagues....We don't have the laughter anymore, but we've gone to the extreme, where I find many of our male  colleagues are very silent on this  issue. I hope maybe we'll hear more  from more of the members of both sexes  on this vital matter of women's rights.  Mrs. P. Jordan (S.C.): ...We can't go  around inducing women to be liberated  by working in Woolworth's 8 hours a  day. We have to also help them understand the value of their ability to  achieve their own economic independence.  Mr. King (NDP): ...I think the Provincial Secretary can do a great deal in  terms of conditioning the attitude of  public service people.... the Provincial Secretary is going to have to be  very tenacious and she may have to  take off the velvet gloves once in a  while to persuade some of the mandarins that, by golly, there is a problem here....  ...It is obviously going to be necessary to collaborate with other ministries. .. .that's the only way it can  be tackled....  Mrs. B.B. Wallace(NDP): ...the point  that I particularly wanted to make  was there is a very great difference  in the needs of women in the more remote and rural areas than there is in  the urban areas. Those are the needs  that have not been really dealt with  as fully as have the needs of the  urban woman.  ...Particularly, I'm thinking of the  farm wife who perhaps participates  fully in the occupation in which her  husband is involved—they jointly  operate a farm—...but very often the  economic security is not there.  ...I would ask.the Provincial Secretary to comment and give us her  thoughts on this situation with rural  women.  Mr. L.B. Kahl(S.C): ...many briefs  have been presented to the government  from various organizations of women  throughout our province. Frankly, I  think the time has come for some action. Many of these briefs are excellent....! think collectively we should  implement many of those programmes and  work together....  Hon. Mrs. McCarthy(S.C.) (in response):  Re funding levels: ...the taxpayers  of British Columbia today arc carrying on their backs the excesses, the  extravagances, and the mismanagement  of the previous government that left  us less funds to do anything with than  we would have wanted to do.  $200,000 : ...the $200,000 which  (Brown) mentioned ...reappears under  Vote 164 in the grants vote. So that  $200,000 goes for special projects in  grants, and women can apply and have  done so. Under that vote we have given  contributions to women's organizations.  (Editor: who?)  Money and opportunities : ... I would  just like to reiterate that the common  problem you have seen in the discussion on women's rights in the province  of B.C. has been one of poverty...  right on the track of good economy,  then and only then can we  solve...the  very real economic problems and those  very real social problems.that the  member (Brown) raises.  Rosemary Brown responds: ...I want  to draw to the Provincial Secretary's  attention that we've been waiting for  2,000 years for the country to get  moving so that we can come to grips  with our poverty. I wonder whether  she could give us some kind of indication as to how much longer we're going  to have to wait.  Hon. Mrs. McCarthy: ...What I'd just  like to say in reply to the last comment is that I think we've come a long  way in 2000 years.... 12  WHAT'S    OUT THERE?  13  The following are some of the numbers that are most often requesteu from the Vancouver Status of Women office.

As the office is becoming more of  a drop-in centre in addition to a  feminist workplace, donations of  non-sexist kids books to keep the  little people happy while we talk  with mothers would be much appreciated.  In an effort to revamp staff responsibilities to counter the overload, we are making an extra effort  this year to involve more members  and volunteer help around the office.  Is anyone interested in  taking over book reviews?  This is  a simple task involving: a)ordering  review copies from publishers; b)  arranging for women to review the  books; c)sending copies of reviews  to the publisher; d)maybe writing a  few reviews of your own; e)liasion  with Kinesis.  It requires that  you drop into the office once a  week to pick up books, write some  letters, make some phone calls.  It would be good for someone who  likes to read and/or write.  If you  are interested, call 736-3746.  Would anyone like to review one or  more of the following books?

(ON THE MOVE), Evonne Goola-  gong  SHE NAMED IT CANADA, by the Corrective  Collective  WORDS AND WOMEN, Kate Swift  - Karen Richardson  BOOK REVIEW  THE IMPSTONE, Susan Musgrave  Susan Musgrave, the young B.C.  poet, has great natural gifts which  she is using early, amply, and with  a justified confidence in her  own poetic voice.  This collection  of short poems is her fourth by  the age of 25.  Her first collection,  Songs of the Sea-Witch, was published during her teens.  Besides  these she has written a children's  book, Gullband.  She is obviously  a productive as well as a talented  writer.  Her real originality makes her  poems seem difficult, even inaccessible, at a first reading.  Her structures are apparently  simple enough, but her treatment  of her themes, which are in one  sense the perennial themes -  mortality, loss, parting, the relationships of love - is much  more complex, strange and unexpected, and so is her treatment of  her repeated natural images - moon,  sea, forest, frog, bone, stone and  so on.  But after repeated readings  the ear grows accustomed to her  voice, and then her meanings gradually emerge, though they are still  elusive sometimes.  And, in any case,  a first reading of Susan Musgrave is  immediately rewarding as she uses  words skillfully and musically,  and at times with a biteing wit.  She also uses with a natural sure-  ness in her writing her heritage  both as a woman and also as a  Vancouver Islander.  The Landscape  which her poems assume is the  landscape of the Canadian Pacific  Coast with its cold seas and forests; while her myths and images-  ravan, eagle, frog, whale- draw  upon her interest in Haida culture.  She spent three years while writ  ing these poems in the Queen Charlotte Islands, and I think this  is evident in the quality of the  poems, for though she is essentially  concerned with the world of her  own imagination, the facts she uses  are fully known and digested facts,  not the romantic guesses of the  city dweller.  Susan Musgrave's gift was recognized early: her work has been  published by good poetry magazines here, in the U.S., and in  England; she has been acclaimed by  reviewers - 'the next major poet  in English Canada' speculates one  writer - and supported over a  period of years by the Canada  Council.  Reviewers don't go on  producing bouquet after bouquet,  however, and the reception of  The Impstone has been less delighted.  Some critics have  suggested that she is at the  moment writing too much, too  quickly, and not working her  poems hard enough.  It is true  that they are limited to a cold,  moonlit world and that there is  an enormous range of resonance,  meaning and poetic language that  is utterly beyond her as yet. Her  poems are charming and fantastic:  possibly it is necessary for her  to struggle more with her material  and abandon some of the charm, and  even some of the fantasy, before  she can wholly fulfill her promise.  Otherwise she ;may find herself  trapped in the delicacies of minor  art.  Even so, The Impstone is  well worth re-reading and savouring.  - June Sturrock  BOOK  REVIEW  HER OWN WOMAN: PROFILES OF TEN  CANADIAN WOMEN, Myrna Kostash, Me-  linda McCracken, Valerie Miner, Erna  Paris, Heather Robertson  Bored with the theme of woman as victim, the authors of this book decided  to produce these ten profiles as a  kind of counterweight.  Each profile  examines a woman who has strongly and  successfully rejected  the victim-  role and become as completely herself  as possible, hence the title.  The  subjects range from totally unknown  women, such as Kathleen, the law student, and Edith McCracken, who spent  a lifetime in the traditional female  roles, to the famous, such as Judy  LaMarsh and Margaret Atwood.  In age,  these women range from their twenties  to their seventies.  This makes for some interesting, occasionally exciting, reading, though  the book is not uniformly well written, and some of it is flawed by  the same air of slightly obtuse complacency as the introduction; surely  the authors cannot really believe,  as they seem to suggest, that the victim role is necessarily chosen and  not imposed.  Some of the profiles are excellent,  however,  I particularly enjoyed  reading about Madeleine Parent, the  Quebec union leader.  She is a  natural fighter, and in the Quebec  textile industries in the early  1940-'s, she found a battle worth  fighting: 'Children from the age  of 10 worked 55 hours a week for  as little as 18c an hour...Most  of the men worked 65 hours a week...  Women suffered most from favouritism  since sex was a common trade-off  better jobs were available to women  who slept with their male superiors  ...Children were punished or misused  ...and any one of any age who used  the bathroom more than twice a day  had his pay docked.'  Madeleine  Parent fought for unionization and  won: she is in the habit of winning.  Erna Paris, the author of  this profile, admires this strength  greatly, but also points out Madeleine Parent's tendency to simplify  issues and to manipulate people.  This is a piece of honest* informative writing.  S0 too is Valerie  Miner's piece on Abby Hoffman, the  athlete, activist and university  teacher, another splendidly energetic woman - her favourite pe-  joratives are 'sloth' and 'indolence*.  She emerges as an essentially  independent and even isolated character.  This is obviously in part  the result of her exceptional upbringing, which freed her from the  usual adolescent period of obsession  with her appearance and sexual attractions.  Not only was this not  expected of her by her parents; it  would have made her ridiculous in  their eyes.  So she was able to enjoy in freedom the strength and  skill of both body and mind with  their support, and with her mother's  fine example before her.  The mutual  respect bred in the family by this  attitude was lasting.  CONTINUED PAGE 15.... 15  .CONTINUED FROM PAGE 14  Indeed, this book shows clearly how  much of the strength of such women  springs from the example or excourage-  ment of one or both parents.  Madeleine Parent's family, though disagreeing with her, respected and  supported her.  Margaret Atwood's parents brought her up to be a free,  independent person, as they both were.  Barbara Frum speaks of herself as  'the third generation of a really  natriarchal family1, while Kathleen,  too, says that both her grandmother  and her mother ran their families.  Only the painter, Esther Warkov,  seems to see her achievement as  something which happened in spite  of her family.  This book certainly  increases one's sense of parental  responsibility!  Some of the book is rather disappointing.  The profiles of both  the artists, Esther Warkov and  Margaret Atwood, are interesting  and informative enough, but interviewers' tone is somehow uncomprehending about the nature  of their work.  And the profiles  of Judy LaMarsh and Barbara Frum,  while competent, are totally insensitive: readable though they  are, they leave the reader indifferent.  This is not a fault with  the book as a whole; most of it is  stimulating and involving.  June Sturrock  15 ISIS DEAD?  ISIS: WOMEN'S MEDIA ±s  well known in  B.C. Mo Simpson, staff member of Isis,  says"It is amazing—fantastic— to  see how wide our network is! No matter  where we went in B.C. there were .  people using our services."  Isis is a women's media centre for  16 mm films, video tapes, slide/sound  productions, audio tapes, and print  packages (all on loan free except for  the cost of postage, insurance and  maintenance). Isis also shares its  experience and expertise — they will  teach women how to use equipment; how  to plan programmes; how to guide discussion groups; how to do photography,  recording,etc. Their darkroom facilities are available to women. Isis  also strives to fill the gaps in  existing materials — if there is  nothing, or little, available on  an issue they will produce a 16mm  film, video tape,etc.( a recent production on menopausal women has been  widely used).  In January 1976, Isis sent a proposal  to the Provincial Secretary (whose  office had provided funds for two  years) asking for funds to continue  their work. The service Isis provides  Bias a provincial base and they feel  it should be supported by the provincial government. For some reason,  the Provincial Secretary forwarded .  the proposal to a cultural- group in  Vancouver who rejected it as being  completely inappropriate for their  organization. Isis then decided, in  recognition of the oft-stated need  for monetary restraint, to cut their  budget to the bare bones (from  $67,000 to $21,000, which would mean  that only 2 of the 5h  staff would  be salaried) and re-submit to the  Provincial Secretary. Support letters  showing the province wide usage of  the group's services were also sent.  During the months that followed Isis  YOU &THE LAW  This is the second of a series of  columns written by the staff of the  Vancouver People's Law School. More  information about each topic can be  obtained by calling the People's Law  School (681-7532) and ordering the  booklets mentioned below. The Vancouver People's Law School offers free  courses for lay people on various  areas of the law. For a copy of the  summer schedule, call the above number.  FAMILY COURT ORDERS  The first column (July KINESIS) explained Family Court support orders.  The Family Court can also make orders  relating to custody and access (visiting rights) to children.  Separated parents who agree about  custody of their children can sign  an agreement. The separation agreement  can be registered in Family Court and  the registered agreement is enforce-i  able as if it is a Family Court custody order. Therefore, if your spouse  breaks the agreement you can contact  the Family Court to have it enforced.  When the parents cannot agree as to  custody, either one can apply to the  Family Court for an order as to custody  and access (visiting rights). A temporary order can be made quickly in an  emergency situation, for example where  one parent threatens to take the children away. Contact the Family Court  immediately if this situation arises.  The temporary order is effective until there can be a full hearing as to  the merits of the custody application.  As custody hearings are serious matters, a parent should obtain legal  advice; a parent who qualifies financially can obtain legal aid. In the  special Unified Family Courts in Richmond and Surrey, the Family Advocate ■  at the Court is appointed as the lawyer to represent the interests of the  children.  At the trial, the Court hears evidence  as to the parents' financial circumstances, their home environment and  their plans for the future care of  the children. The Court must decide  who is to have custody based on what  is in the best interests of the children. The 'best interests' of the child  is determined by the facts of each  case. The Court looks for a stable,  supportive home environment where the  child will be happiest.

ISIS  hopefully sent off more support  letters, evaluations of their films  by users, and a list of all the  groups and people all over the province who were booking their services  (they are usually booked solid). The  list included women's groups, health  units, church groups, schools, women's  studies programmes at colleges. Federation of Labour, National Film  Board, Rape Relief, sororities, art  groups, community groups, Parent-  Teacher groups, Indian Friendship  Centres, Crisis'Centres. The one  official piece of communication they  received during this time was a .  letter from the Provincial Secretary  thanking them for the list.  However, Isis was in communication  with an administrative officer of  the Provincial Secretary's office  who assured them in several telephone  conversations that he had recommended that they be funded and "three  groups will get funding and you're  one of them." When they inquired at  Secretary of State about the advis-  ibility of submitting a proposal  there, they were informed that officers at Secretary of State had had  similar conversations with this officer regarding provincial secretary  funding for Isis. Believing that in  a time of fiscal restraint they should  be careful not to hinder another1  group's chances for funds, Isis  agreed not to apply to Secretary of  State.  Encouraged by their phone conversations, Isis spent the last of their  money on printing and distributing  1000 new catalogues instead of taking salaries.  On July 14th the ax fell. A short  letter from the Hon. Grace McCarthy,  Provincial Secretary, arrived,' informing them that money was tight  and "In assessing your programme, my  Department recommends that distribut-  • ion of films through the educational  system could best be handled through  other organizations such as the University or Department of Education,  in order to carry on this service.  A copy of this letter is being sent  to the Minister of Education for his  information."  Marfan Bancroft of Isis staff, points  out that this suggestion is not feasible — both their base of service  and their materials are extremely  broad and extremely varied. Isis  topics range through Health, Native  Women, Welfare, Employment, Socialization and Stereotyping, Women and  the Law, Women's Art, Sexuality, B.C.  Pioneer Women, Working Mothers, Menopause, Daycare, Welfare, Marriage,  Women in China, and more.  Also, Marian points out, Isis approached the Department of Education about  funding last year and were told that  they were not appropriate.  The unkindest cut of all was the concluding sentence of the Provincial  Secretary's letter,"I trust that your  programme will be continued."  "How?" demanded- Mo Simpson, "This is  how people are burned out. You put  everything you have into the work  you are doing — and just hold on  and try to scrape by — none of us  at Isis has had a salary of more than  $400 a month — and your fate is in  someone's hands and you wait and wait  to know.... How are we suppose to  continue?"    If you think the death of Isis is a  blow to the whole women's movement  in B.C. and will mean a loss to the  great variety of women's and community groups, schools, etc. that relied  on their services, WRITE and tell the  Provincial Secretary, the Hon. Grace  McCarthy. WRITE to your MLA too —  Isis Services have been used in every  riding in this province.  - Jo Lazenby 16  - Diana Bissell (former VSW Membership  Coordinator and now Community Education Consultant on Women's Issues for  Secretary of State, based in Prince  George) sneds us chatty accounts of  her adventures in Northern B.C. to  be shared with the readers of KINESIS.

Dear Sisters:  I have just come back from a 9 day  road trip — halfl of which was spent  with Gail Borst and Judy Patterson.  (Gail Borst is Women's Organizer for  B.C. Federation of Labour & Judy  Patterson has just been elected  Chairwoman of NDP Women's Committee.)  We drove up to Terrace for the May 29  women's conference there, then on to  Prince Rupert where Gail and Judy met  with Union and NDP women and I spent  a lot of time with the Prince Rupert  Options for Women group. Then I got  on  ye olde Greyhound bus and zipped  back to Hazelton, Smithers and then  Prince george. On Tuesday it's back  on the bus to visit Dawson Creek and  Fort St. John.  First impressions of the land — great  strength in the vast rolliness — -  gorgeous mixture of jackpine and  birch trees. As you move northwest  and hit the Buckley Valley the singularly beautiful mountains just take  away one's breath. Following the  Skeena down to the coast is a TRIP  and I wished I had a canoe. Interesting to watch spring happen at different times in different places — fun  to watch the sun set in Rupert at 11  p.m.  And it is so great to be welcomed by  so many women everywhere. Many of them  came to the Rally—and we do an "old  times" hug and start talking. Others  are regular correspondents with VSW  and it is great to put a face with  their signatures and addresses. Most  of them are new names though— and  my address book is bulging.  I met alot of people at the conference  in Terrace and enjoyed the well organized day of speakers that had been  set up by Terrace Women's Organization. It was a good learning experience  for me too—I had been asked to speak  about my new job, etc,etc and it was  interesting to see how that kind of  formal "stand up in front of the class"  talk went over compared to just "mooching around" and being with people.  You hear, feel, and learn much more  when you take the time to stay in one  place for awhile and let people get  to know you on their terms.  NORTHERN NOTES  Hazelton was great—20 women got  together and talked about what kind  of women's group they want and need—  for themselves and for the community.  In Smithers a lot of work is being  done by the local Indian Friendship  Centre with a Native Women's Cultural  3roup, and in Prince Rupert the Options for Women group invited counsellors from all the schools to participate in a conversation on sexism in  education — WOW — did we ever learn  a lot about their perspectives on that  topic! In Mackenzie we went through  a stud mill with Mary Halliday (a woman who has worked there for 2 years)  and also met with Joan Kotarski and  Linda Kelly Smith who eked a tiny  women's centre program out of a LIP  grant and are now scrambling for funds  to keep some kind of women's program  running in this company town of 6,000  where there isn't even a community  centre.  Really am enjoying all the resource  material listed in KINESIS — and am  missing my easy access to the piles  of KINESIS in the back room! I hoard  the 3 or 4 issues you send me and  give them out only to very deperate  people! Maybe we should open up a  northern VSW warehouse!  Love, Diana  July 8/76.  Dear Sisters:  Well, so far I have been out on the  road a total of 5 weeks and have  covered the highway from Prince Rupert  to Dawson Creek. In the last month I  have been away 17 days—mainly in the  northwest area. Had a wonderful time  with the Prince Rupert Options for  Women group—we did a day long workshop together on "Priorities - personal and group". Out of that meeting  came a constitution for the group  (first one) and a new feeling of  energy. The group found that once  they had laid out their personal  reasons for belonging to the organization they could more easily discuss  a structure and priority actions.  Spent 3 days in Kitimat finding but  what it is like to live in a company  town and meeting the terrific people  of that community. Kitimat Women's  Organization wanted to go through a  workshop similar to the Prince Rupert  one so we arranged for M.J. Patterson  of the Rupert group to come down and  "do" one with them a week later—and  it worked well too. The K.W.O. are  doing a survey of employment needs  of women in Kitimat this summer—  should prove to be interesting read-^  ing.  Went to the monthly meeting of the  Prince George's Women Centre.last  night. They have produced a budget  to handle the money they were left  from a grant from Gene (Gene Errington  Provincial Status of Women Coordinator  under last government) and ideas were  flowing hot and heavy. Their political  lobbying group is beginning an assertiveness training course and is in the  midst of planning a workshop on munic-  iple government in the fall. This is  a wonderful idea—so many of us don't  remember our early Social Studies  classes where we were "taught" how  local government functions. They also  have an "Artistic Endeavours" committee  that will be making silkscreens to  turn out feminist notepaper, and T-  shirts — as well as doing posters  for local groups. They hope this will  enable them to become partially self-  sufficient.  The Terrace Women's Organization is  continuing to operate their Child  Minding Centre this summer — looks  like there won't be any more funding  for this project in the fall. The  Child Minding Centre offers quality  babysitting for a minimum fee to any  woman who wishes to use it — and the  usage is high. Women who have a medical appointment, have shopping to do,  or are in town from the "bush" and  need a few hours to themselves all  make use of it. Lesley Weatherston  has written out a full report of the  Centre and how it operates if any of  you are interested in looking into  the idea. (L. Weatherston, 4926 Gair  St. Terrace).  I am just about finished a "first  meeting" with most feminist groups  in the North and will be sending out  a mini-newsletter at the end of July  to about 80 people telling them what  kinds of things I have uncovered and  sharing some of the action ideas  people have talked about.  This is nowhere near an in-depth  report on what's happening in the No  North — but I have to run and catch  the Greyhound bus to Vanderhoof,  Fraser Lake and Burns Lake now!  Suffice it to say that the movement  is alive and well up here!  Love,  Diana.  A Lesbian CR group has begun at VSW.  Structured CR's have been offered  through VSW since last winter, but  many women have indicated a need for  a CR group specifically for Lesbians.  There are 8 women in this first  group.  The format is semi-structured.  There is no leader or facilitator, but the structure of going  around the group, giving each women a chance to speak or pass is  followed.  Part of the agreed upon  structure also includes a specific  time period, day and place for the  group.  One of the underlying principles of  CR   group  structured consciousness raising,  that each woman's experience is  valuable, and that the sharing  of. her experiences is valuable to  the group, is adhered to.  Among the topics suggested by  women at the first organizational  meeting are: Lesbianism/Feminism;  Lesbianism vs. Bisexuality; Being  Open in Public; Popular Myths  about Lesbians; Labels - Dyke,  Lesbian, Woman Identified Woman;  Role Playing (butch/femme), etc.  Each CR meeting will use a topic  from a group compiled list of  about 20 such topics for weekly  discussion.  In addition to gaining support  from each other,-the aim of a  Lesbian CR is to broaden our  awareness of ourselves as women, as lesbians, as feminists.  Anyone interested in being part  of a second Lesbian CR can phone  VSW at 736-3746 to start a list  for a group to begin in August  or September.

This closure is due to the impossibility of obtaining additional financial  assistance.  Chairperson Patti Dyck says,"We regret  having to make this decision but have  found no other alternative. Without  funding assistance we are unable to  maintain the Centre any longer. The  services to the community have already  been reduced substantially, but we  are unable to continue even in this  limited capacity."  The Kelowna Women's Centre first opened in February of 1975 under an L.I.P.  Grant with a seven-woman staff. When  the grant was over in July of 1976,  it was able to remain open with one  salaried worker on funds supplied by  the Regional District and the now defunct Provincial Co-ordinator of the  Status of Women office. >  Contact person: Patti Dyck, 420B  Holbrook Rd.

I believe that it has  taken me at least two years of study  and research to put the facts down  in a way that will do more good than  harm.  So lets look at the facts.  Young women in Canada have become  the major target for the tobacco  industry. Cigarette advertising is  directed at them. Look at any  major magazine printed for women  and you'll see what I mean!  Notice  the increase in very young teenage  girls smoking on the streets. (Smoking on the streets is not a moral  judgement, only to point out the  fact that I could not be aware of  the increase if it were not publicly visible.)  Cigarette smoking is now classed  as the number one killer in North  America. We have well documented  proof that the fetus is badly  effected by a smoking mother, and  children in the homes of smoking  parents have a poorer standard of  health.  Let us examin the haam that smoking  is doing to the women's movement.  How many non-smoking women would  go back for a second jolt after  getting trapped in a smoke-filled  meeting room for an afternoon or  evening? When we have a health  problem of this magnitude, we need  some sound answers and guidance to  move towards a solution.  1. Smokers find it easier to refrain  from smoking when they know that it  is harmful and offensive to others.  2. When meeting or working in an  enclosed space, refrain from smoking  if there are non-smokers present.  Do not put the responsibility on  the other person by saying "Do you  mind if I smoke?". Most women have  not yet reached the point where they  can comfortably say "yes, I do",  thereby depriving you of your so-  called pleasure.  If you must smoke,  smoking  go into an unoccupied, room, or  outside.  3. If you are arranging or chairing  a meeting, make it clear from the  outset if it will be a smokers'  meeting, or a non-smoking meeting  with breaks for smokers. With  this honest approach, at least the  non-smokers can make a real evaluation if they wish to attend.  When I phone and ask this question,  I invariably get the answer that  they don't know.  4. If you decide to make an area  "no smoking", remove ashtrays and  put up suitable signs. A very good  sign for the women's movement would  read:  "In consideration of your own health  and the health of others, please  refrain from smoking."  5. Fill ashtrays with cellophane-  wrapped hard candies and display  pamplets on smoking and health.  6. Always keep the problem open  with lots of free discussion.  The silent treatment (we don't have  a problem) gets us nowhere. 9  7. Be willing to engage the help  of more knowledgeable people in_  the field (the help is free). For  non-smoking situations contact the  United Non-Smokers Society at 228-  0525, President Larry Wanjoff, or  261-6658 (Secretary). For anyone  who wishes to quit, cantact Marie  Tracy, Kick It Classes, at 731-4961.  For posters, literature and buttons,  and no smoking signs, Call 731-4961.  Their experience and guidance can  make the difference between success  and failure.  8. If attendance at your meetings is  dwindling away, and women are gradually drifting away, throw some of  the old excuses out of the window,  the excuses that told you that "women  WRITE A LETTER!  Only 200 Women at B.C. Rail  Recently the Province reported  that while there were only 200  women employed at BC Railway, and  only six at supervisory levels,  the company has no plans to agg  aggressively get women into these  jobs, even though they have "no  hang-ups" about it! As a public  employer, we feel that BCR has  an obligation to be an equal  opportunity employer and be a  model for the private sector.  It is not enough not to discriminate against women. Until we  have affirmative action plans  for working women the gap between  the pay of men and women will  keep steadily increasing. Please  write to Premier Bennett, head of  BCR, asking him to implement an  affirmative action plan, not only  for BCR, but also for the provincial civil service as a whole.  Send carbons to MR.

It is rumoured that Prime Minister Trudeau is considering a  Cabinet shuffle in the fall. We  should take this opportunity to  urge him to make the Minister  Responsible for the Status of  Women a separate portfolio, and  that the minister chosen should  be a woman. The position is now  the responsibility of Marc Lalonde,  who is also responsible for Health  and Welfare. Don't women deserve  a minister all to themselves? If  you agree, write to Mr. Trudeau  and your own MP urging same.  Address your letters to federal  politicians at the House of Commons,  Ottawa, Ontario.

Be willing to remember, that whereas  a smoker has built up a resistance to  tobacco smoke, a non-smoker has no  such resistance, and suffers more  from the idling end of a burning cigarette, (smoke that has not been  filtered through the lungs or a  filter) than a smoker does.  10. Science has scarcely begun to assess the combined effect of cigarette  smoke amd chemical pollution that  workers are subjected to every working  day.  (Such chemical pollutants as  asbestos, hair spray, plastic solvents,  and all petroleum products). The  results of research already done,  show that this could be the most  devastating medical news of the  century.  The Third World Conference on  Smoking and Health called on the  Women's Liberation movement to encourage women to rebel against the  old social order, and set a healthy  example to one another and to their  children by the act of not smoking.  Let us take action so that the young  teen age girls who believe they've  "come a long way baby", when they  light up, do not equate this with  equality and freedom, but more accurately with illness and death.  Let us do our part to get this message accross to them, by making  smoking as socially unacceptable as  we can.  Since it was the women's movement  that pulled down tha advertising  campaign that claimed "the longer  the better", (women's legs stretched  over a man hole), because it was  sexist, it should now take another  look at the same kind of advertising  and examine it under the heading of  women and health.

Money will be available to you for  a loan when you need it, at low cost,  and without discrimination as to age,  sex, marital status, or lifestyle.  The only considerations will be  ability and willingness to repay.  Low cost financing for community  organizations, cooperative ventures,  and bulk purchasing programs will  bring you an increasing range of  goods and services at minimum cost.  AND HOW MUCH IS THAT IN DOLLARS?  On an average deposit of $500, you  are passing up perhaps $35 per year  in interest. Now, let's say a low-  cost loan allows a food co-op to get  off the ground, permitting you to  save 15 per cent on your groceries  (a modest estimate). If you normally  spend $50 a month on groceries, your  savings for the year will amount to  $90. So on that alone, you're $55  ahead. And there are many other ways  in which your dollars, co-operatively  invested, can bring you savings on  goods and services you need.  This kind of bank is of particular  interest to women. One of the loan  categories approved at the most recent  general meeting (that is, purposes  for which loans may be given) was  Social Organizing and Women. Also it  is our stated policy to give loans  on a non-disriminating basis. The  B.C. Federation of Women is one of  the groups which are part of our Bond  of Association.

The Coalition was formed about 3h  years ago when a group of women got  together to share their concerns for  the advancement of women's rights and  their realization that institutionalized religion was more hindrance than  help in developing the full personhood  of women. Coming from Jewish, Unitarian, Protestant and Catholic traditions  members discovered their common spirituality and sisterhood. They began to  organize an action-reflection group,  hoping to make changes in the world  and survive struggle..  The Coalition has published several  works dealing with women and religion.  It republished The Women's Bible, a  commentary by Elizabeth Cady Stanton  first published in 1895 and 1897.  Price is $6.95 + 50c postage.

FULL CIRCLE COFFEE HOUSE  FRIDAYS 8:30 - 1:00 am  THE NEW SCHOOL, 3070 COMMERCIAL  WOMEN ONLY SURVEY RESULTS ON STATUS OF WOMEN  Marc Lalonde, Minister Responsible  for Status of Women has released the  results of a nation-wide survey on  attitudes towards the status of women.  A 20 % shift in the attitudes of women  and men towards women's equality occurred between December 1974 and December  1975, according to the findings of the  survey. Survey results also indicated  that 86% of the population were aware  that 1975 was International Women's  Year and 74% of the population recalled the "Why Not" advertising for the  year.  The survey was designed to show current  attitudes on women's roles and potent- '  ial abilities and to measure any  changes in attitude that occurred during 1975, International Women's Year.  Attitudes on such topics as equal  employment opportunity, child care,  marital property division, custody of  children and women working in the home  were investigated.  In releasing the survey results, the  Minister noted that this was the first  comparative evaluation survey on  attitudes conducted by the government  and this fact indicated the high priority the government placed on status  of women concerns.  21  PUBLICATION GRANTS  Twenty-six grants totally $25,000  have been awarded by Honourable Marc  Lalonde, Minister of National Health  and Welfare and Minister Responsible  for the Status of Women, in the final  phase of the department's IWY program.

So, I wandered into the expanse of  Habitat Forum on byways and highways,  left by the beach or by boat, each  time with the feeling that all this  just came my way and that I did not  cross any boundary at any time. The  readily available connection with  the downtown conference, the media  and the non-stop reportting over  Channel 10 at home enhanced the feel-  'Ģ ing of ubiquity.  In these beautiful natural surroundings of Habitat Forum the air vibrated  with statements, concepts and plans  about improving the human condition  all over the globe; and the feeling  of harmony almost promised to become  permanent.  However, below this harmony, above the  sounds of guitars, crowds and P.A.  systems lingered the ubiquitous crying of infants. Their cries were typical of children who have been kept  awake too lone and were unable to fall  asleep in the surrounding noise.  Following the sound, mothers with  small children carried around in slings  could be found, exhausted, pathetic  and passive, trying to get a bottle  out from the rucksacks on thei backs.  When they finally offered it to the  distraught baby it mostly refused to  drink and chose to continue its vocal  protests. There were always bottles  on the Lost and Found counter.  Now I began to look for a place where  parent and child could relax in comfort., o  A long padded counter, bins,  bottle warmers, cribs, playpens were  set up at several locations at Expo  67... A model resting unit serves  those travelling with children at  Dorval Airport. There were no such  conveniences at Habitat except for  the playroom of the World Council of  Churches. The well-represented child-  focussed organizations has only printed educational material but no facilities had been planned for the parent  with a young child.  However it is the need which inspires  solutions. It was heartening to see  the signs and conveniences for the  handicapped. Bicycle route signs also  begin to imake their welcome appearance  along side the "Children Crossing"  symbols.  Maybe the next addition to the international sign alphabet could be an  infant's face peeking from the shoulder  of a figure whose face does not show  and whose silhouette could suggest  either parent.  As it is our Vancouver Parks Board  who will develop the Habitat Forum  site, I would like to suggest that  a model parent-child habitat be one  of its features: as basic and lovely  in style as the Forum had been.  Finding and financing an attendent  where other conveniences are already  available would ease matters for a  relatively inexpensive addition of  such habitats as malls, terminals, a '  exhibition sites or convention centres,  for the comfort of parents with small  children.  It has to be realized that neither  father or mother, united or single,  can afford to stay still in their  own adult development and community  participation in today's fast moving  society if they aim to become the  competent parents whom the next generation needs to orient them, as  traditional models dissolve at an  increasing speed.  - Mrs. E.

(July KINESIS).  Juliet Mitchell, in Women's Estate,  points out that the women's movement  is mainly taking place in urban  centres. Rural women, because of such  factors as isolation, transportation  difficulties, lack of communication  media, traditional farm roles, entrenched religious attitudes, etc.,  are mostly untouched by the women's  movement.  Because of these problems, we in the  Mission area have been very careful  to make our approach educational,  presenting films and speakers on women's law, birth control, menopause,  etc. In this way we try to involve as  many women as possible, not just those  committed to the movement. We are  purposefully "apolitical" and "middle  of the road" (to quote P.P.'s criticisms) .  We were very pleased to have a broad  spectrum of women's groups represented, including the Mission Women's  Institute ("women quilting") with whom  we share space and facilities. If we  are willing to communicate with other  women's groups, to tell them our point  of view and listen to theirs, how then  is the message to spread?  . Does P.P. suggest that radical/political women meet with other radical/  political women only? To what end?  In the Fraser Valley, that would be  a small meeting indeed!  A few women spent a lot of time and  energy, travelling great distances,  to organize this first festival, and  were pleased at the result. I hope  next year's festival,will be reported  more favourably, with greater understanding of our problems instead of  criticism of our shortcomings.  Sincerely,  Milly Toporowski, for Fronya Women's  Centre, Mission.  KINESIS:  Please remind readers of the next  issue that Channel 9 (PBS) is repeating "Shoulder to Shoulder" on  Wednesdays and Fridays at 9 pm  starting the 25th of July.  This is the story of the British  suffragette movement, and especially  of Emmeline Pankhurst and her  daughters Sylvia and Christabel.  Rebecca West has said of these  women: " their physical courage was  amazing. They went to prison time  and time again without the slightest hesitation if the movement  called for it." There they endured  not only squalid prison conditions  but the torture of forced feeding  when they were on hunger strikes.  But they would not give up.  I found this series inspiring and  a terrific consciousness raiser  for my sons and myself. One of the  most interesting aspects was seeing  how the women became more radical  and political over the years.  While on might not agree with all  their actions one could sympathize  with them—and gasp at their courage  and determination..  Angela Page  KINESIS:  I was dismayed to read, in the July  issue of Kinesis, yet another collection of absurdities labeled "Facts  About the Pill". It was reprinted from  the Quesnel Women's Study Group newsletter, and is a typical example of  mistakes and half-truths collected  by some excited woman who has just  read for the first time about the  problems associated with oral contraceptives.  For instance: doctors DO know exactly  how the Pill works. Via a negative  feedback system, it suppresses the  release of gonadtropin releasing  factor from the hypothalamus, thus  suppressing the release of follicle  stimulating hormone and luteinizing  hormone from the pituitary, thus  suppressing the growth and release  of an egg from the ovary. This no more  more "interferes" with the function  of the pituitary gland than does the  natural feedback suppression effect  of one's own estrogens and progestens.  The multitude of Pill effects on the  body chemistry, such as thyroid, liver  and blood studies, are thought to be  direct effects on the tissues involved  and are not mediated through some  sinister tinkering with your pituitary.  No woman on the Pill should be surprised to learn that there are risks.  If she has been living under a rock  for the last 15 years and has heard  nothing about them, let us hope she  does not accept drugs without any idea  of the possible side effects.  Thromboembolism and blood vessel clotting are not synonymous. Thrombosis is  not dangerous: embolism is. (That is,  except for something like cerebral  vein thrombosis, of which one single  solitary case exists in literature).  The risk of stroke to pill takers is  much, much less than "1 or 2 per cent  per 10,000" which I presume means 100  to 200 women out of every ten thousand.  It is actually about 13 per million  young women — probably somewhat low- .  er, since this figure also includes  pulmonary embolism (lung clots) and  lower still since low-dose pills came  out: probably somewhat higher for  women over 40. The risk of getting  an annoying, but not dangerous, clot  in a superficial leg vein is about  450 per 100,000 young women: not  trivial, but not exactly terrifying.  Your risk of getting some other annoying side effect is high, but trivial  when compared to the annoyances that  go along with abortions and)pregnancies.  Women who remain frightened by a  figure of 13 deaths per million users  ought to realize that death from abortion is much, much commoner and death  from pregnancy is hundreds of times  commoner than deaths from Pills: yet  do we frantically avoid pregnancy for  that reason alone?  Nutritional needs do not "skyrocket"  on the Pill. The need for certain  vitamins increases somewhat, but can  be met by all but the most inadequate  diets. There has been no known case  of an actual deficiency induced by  the birth control pill.  Can't someone edit these garbled,  ignorant accounts before they are  printed as "fact"?  Yours,  Kirsten Emmott, M.D.  Victoria. 24  Letters cont'd  KINESIS:  I read with interest your article on  Susan (June KINESIS, page 12,  "View from the Inside") and it prompted  me to get going to find a solution.  One of the main factors in Susan's  plight was lack of child maintenance'  from their father.  Answer: Our government makes damn  sure they collect income tax for  necessities ie. school, roads, MP's  salaries, etc. Why not deduct from  a father's salary the amount owing  for child support according to his  wages, say a percentage (10 - 15%?).  The government (like Family Allowance  cheques) would remit the amount to  the mother. This would eliminate  mother going to Family Court. Also,  if the father got a raise, etc. the  children would receive more as they  got older.  I do not think the majority would  leave the country, in which case the  mother would go on Welfare.  This solution would considerably reduce the welfare ranks and mothers  would be happier knowing they're not  accepting hand-outs, but what they  are entitled to.  I am a single parent with 3 children  but with a good job and some support.  Without the but I would be in the  same position.  Carole Gillies, Vancouver  KINESIS:  The question may well be asked  whether the cause of feminism  is menaced more by masculine opposition than by the ignorant  hysteria and lurid rhetoric of  some of its own evangelists.  Your July issue quoted these two  sentences from Dr. Dorothy Smith,  Associate Professor of Sociology  at UBC:  "Women have been actively excluded  from access to the means of 'mental  production* and from claiming the  authority to speak for themselves.  Women who have attempted to make  such claims have in the past been  burned, guillotined, exiled, and  incarcerated in mental institutions,  and in the present they have been  (and continue to be) ridiculed,  reviled, and insulted."  .  I challenge Dr. Smith to name one  single woman who was burnt or  guillotined for claiming the right  to speak for herself and who would  have been spared such a fate if  she had been a man taclng cue  same accusations.  Joan of Arc  was burnt at the stake: would  she have escaped it if she had been  a peasant-youth instead of a peasant-girl?  Women are faced with a choice: to  regard the male sex as a body of  malignant fiends with whom must be  waged a perpetual truceless war,  or to view men as fellow-beings who  have often been their fellow  victims in the past and may be such  in the future unless more stress  is laid on what unites than upon  what divides.  Is it so hard to  decide what is the saner and more  human choice?  Geoffrey B. Riddehough  correction  An unfortunate "regular feature" seems  to have taken a foothold in KINESIS.  Once again this month we have to  proffer an apology/correction.  On Page 2 of the July KINESIS we  listed the members of the 1976-77  VSW Board of Directors — except for  the VSW Ombudswoman LEE MASTERS. Our  apologies to Lee (and our thanks for  the quite nice manner in which she  brought our attention to this glaring omission).  •FUNDING FOR WOMEN  Provincial Secretary Grace McCarthy  has said that despite the closure of  the Provincial Status of Women office  under her department, women's groups  could still apply to her for money.
