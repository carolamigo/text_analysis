Ever since the first group of Chinese  people arrived on Canadian shores July  20th and asked for refugee status, the "voice  of the people"—that is, the mainstream  media—has been consistently letting fly  vile and vitriolic diatribes against the  "illegals." [For the record, it is not illegal to  land in Canada and apply for refugee status.]  Some local politicians and bureaucrats  have also gotten into the act. Lois Boone,  the minister for children and families, made  comments about BC having to bear the  brunt (read: costs) of illegal smuggling operations. She didn't seem too concerned  about the people being "smuggled."  Then there's Ross Dawson, director of  child protection services in BC. He fired off  a letter to the 75 Chinese children, aged 11  to 14, suggesting they would be better off  returning home to their families. "As [their]  Stop the deportation of Acier Gomez!  Urgent: write a letter to Elinor Caplan!  She's the (new) Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration. Call on her to issue a minister's permit to Acier Gomez. It's Acier's last  chance to stop the deportation order against  hen  Gomez came to Canada in November  1990 from the Philippines under the Foreign Domestic Movement (FDM)—now, the  Live-in Caregiver Program. She went to  work for a man in Prince George to care  for his three-month old infant.  When she applied under the FDM, she  declared her status as single, to keep her  papers consistent with those she filled in  when she applied for work in Singapore.  She had previously been advised by her  employment agency to indicate she was  single on her documents, which, they said,  would help her secure employment.  When she applied for landed immigrant status, her employer—who knew she  had been married before but had separated  from her husband, and that she had four  children in the Philippines—advised her to  again list her status as single. She and her  employer later married and they had a  child, Amber.  One June 3,1996, she left her husband  because he was abusive towards her. She  feared for her safety and the well-being of  their children. She got a peace bond against  him for protection.  Three weeks after their separation,  Gomez was called by Canada Immigration  for an interview. She was told by an Immigration officer to declare her mistake, and  that they would help her get her children  from the Philippines.  Instead, Gomez received a subpoena  and appeared before an immigration inquiry on June 10,1997. She was ordered deported from Canada on the basis that she  had "misrepresented" her status at the time  of her entry into Canada.  Gomez filed an appeal of her deportation order on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The Immigration Appeal  Division denied her appeal, and the Federal Court of Canada refused to hear her  application for appeal.  Last December, Gomez requested that  the Department of Immigration stay (set  aside) her deportation order. Up to this  time, Canada Immigration has not formally  responded to her request.  Elinor Caplan is Acier Gomez' last  hope. She has the authority to issue a minister's permit to allow Acier to remain in  Canada. Please help in this campaign.

Question: why can't  child protection services ensure there are  enough support systems to "protect" these  young people from such a fate.  Let's make something clear: not every  "native" Canadian holds these views.  Kinesis has heard reports from Vancouver Island that people in the communities  of Victoria/Esquimalt (where many of the  Chinese people are being held) and Port  Hardy (where the second set of Chinese  migrants were first taken after landing)  have come forward with offers of food,  clothing and blankets. However, officials  (namely, the RCMP and military personnel)  would not allow them to pass on their provisions to the migrants.  For those of us in the women's movement, we need to ask ourselves, where are  we? Has anyone spoken up about this issue? If not, why? If so, why are our voices  being shut out?  Here at Kinesis, we are also guilty of  not taking the lead in countering the racist  backlash. In our next issue, we will run a  number of articles on the situation of refugees and immigrants in Canada, including  analysis of a recent Supreme Court of  Canada decision chastizing Immigration  Canada for its biased ruling in the case of  Mavis Baker.  In the meantime, we have heard that a  number of women in Vancouver are trying  to provide support for the Chinese women  migrants. For more information, call us  here at Kinesis, (604) 255-5499.  After a much deserved—and much enjoyed—break, the women of Kinesis are  back on the job! Well rested from our July  sojourn, with summer tans and tons of stories to boot, we finally returned to enjoy  our beloved mango coloured walls and to  bring you the September issue of Kinesis.  Although we were initially reluctant to  spend ANY time indoors due to an  unprecented amount of sunshine, some  newly established traditions and a number  of new—and old—faces helped coax us  back into production mode.  So without further ado and to satisfy  the avid curiosity of our faithful readers,  here is a short account of the above mentioned "traditions" that we have decided  to firmly follow every production.  Communal cooking and feasting!!!  "I'm hungry!" "There's nothing to eat!"  "Does anybody have any food?" Fridge  raids that come up empty handed...loud  and insistent tummy rumblings... wishful  fantasies about home cooked food... all put  to rest! Finally!  How, you ask? By utilizing our two  burner hot plate [thanks Colleen and  George,] some left over chicken, garam  masala and lotsa team cooking... Yup!  The Kinesis team finally cooked a meal  together during production in our office  space and we liked it so much we did it  two days in a row! And we wanna keep on  doing it and feeding all our faithful volunteers.  So for those of you who thought that  production was all grunt work, think again!  Think chicken curry, shrimp fried rice and  peach cobbler... Yummy!  Good food is nothing without good  entertainment and even better company! So  to that end, we've decided to venture into  the world of Bollywood (India's version of  Hollywood) every month and catch at least  one flick! The melodrama, the songs, the  constant outfit changes...it's all just too  fabulous! For those who don't understand  Hindi, not to worry...the plots are pretty  self-explanatory!  You might be wondering who the  lucky women were who got to enjoy all this  food and entertainment with us. Well we're  the lucky ones, and we'd like to thank all  the fabulous women who volunteered their  time and energy during this month's production.  A special thank you to Linda Cheng  who designed our awesome soon-to-be-released Kinesis pamphlet. Also a big welcome to new writers Francis Foran,  Merrilee Hughes, Shana Myara, Gabriele  Kohlmeyer, Angela MacCrae, Quita,  Deanna, Margaret, Sharon and Suzanne.  And last but not least, a special thanks  to our Kinesis mascots Taine, Patsy and the  newest addition to the team Kimchi, Jenn  Lo's white, baby bunny. Stay away from  those computer wires, Kimchi!  While we're at it, we'd also like to  thank all of our new subscribers who responded so enthusiastically to our recent  subscription drive! Our sub drive campaign has been quite the success so far, with  more than 110 new individual and group  subscribers signing up. We welcome you  all to the world of Kinesis... We hope you  enjoy your first issue.  Thanks also to VanCity Community  Foundation for providing us with some  grant monies to support our subscription  drive. Much appreciated.  For those of you who might be wondering, the dates for our next story meetings will be September 7 and October 5 at  7:00pm. We will back be in production for  our October issue from September 21 to 28.  So come down and join us for some fabulous food, music... We'll even give you  some work to do.  On a somewhat sadder note, we'd like  to take a moment to remember Kim Perrot,  a WNBA (Women's National Basketball  Association) player who recently passed  away. Perrot played for the top ranked  Houston Comets—as a point guard (#10)—  and was instrumental in helping her team  win two consecutive WNBA championships.  We searched in vain for some relevant  coverage regarding her, but aside from an  extremely brief (three sentences) mention  in the sports pages of a local newspaper,  there was nothing at all.  Perrot inspired many with her incredible skill and presence on the basketball  court, and with her consistent mentoring  of young girls in her spare time. She was  the heart and soul of her team and will be  missed by both players and fans alike.  Perrot passed away on August 23rd  and was remembered at a city wide memorial service held in her honour in Houston. She died of non-lifestyle related lung  cancer, which also spread to her brain.  Well, that's it for this edition of  Inside Kinesis. Tune in next time for more  details about our in-house feasts, volunteers and latest bunny escapades!  Now, where did that rabbit get to...  SIS  SEPTEMBER 1999 News  Pan-Canadian child care initiative:  A vision for our future  by Agnes Huang  The time is now, say child care advocates across the country.  For what? To step up the campaign for  a pan-Canadian child care initiative—one  that best fits the needs of all families, however they are defined.  The opportunity to push ahead comes  on the heels of a number of "openings."  First, in early July, a "leaked" report  out of Health Canada pushed the child care  issue back in the public consciousness. Although much of the discussion that ensued  focused on the conflict between "stay-at-  home moms" versus "working moms" and  promoted tax cuts as the solution, it became  clear again that almost 80 percent of Cana-  dians support some form of publicly  funded child care program.  Then, at the Liberal caucus meeting in  Halifax last month, Prime Minister Jean  Chretien made some overtures to spending on social programs, not just giving to  tax cuts.  Many child care advocates were on  hand trying to sway Liberal MPs to lobby  Finance Minister Paul Martin to direct some  of his government's budget surplus towards a national child care initiative.  Another opening child care advocates  are focusing on is the "social union," signed  in February by the federal, provincial and  territorial governments. The social union  marks a new era in defining government  responsibility for providing social programs.  Since Martin read out his government's  annual budget in February 1995, the Liberals have been trying pulling out of the social program arena. The Canadian Health  and Social Transfer and the dissolving of  the Canada Assistance Program (with its  national standards for welfare) were two  prime examples of this trend.  Under the social union agreement, the  federal government would engage in joint  initiatives only if a sufficient number of provincial/territorial governments (likely, a  majority) show interest.  Child care advocates want to use the  development of a comprehensive child care  initiative as a test case for the social union.  And finally, the release of the National  Children's Agenda in May also presented  an opportunity for advocates to press government to commit dollars to support children and their families [see sidebar.]  Over the past two years, the Canadian  Child Care Advocacy Association of  Canada (CCAAC) has been considering  how to renew the child care advocacy  movement. Last year, the organization conducted a consultation with child care advocates across the country.  Those who attended the consultation  came out saying it was important to define  the kinds of services that should be offered  and for whom.  "Right now, childcare is characterized  by fragmentation," says the CCAAC's  Maryann Bird. "It's a patchwork, not only  between provinces but among local regions  as well."  What is absolutely critical is providing  a range of child care services that support  and strengthen families, says Bird. "We  want all families to have real choices. Child  care should not be a targetted social program only for poor children."  She adds that an equally important  piece would be the enhancement of family  leave policies (maternity and paternity benefits), including more job protection for  women who choose to stay on maternity  leave longer than allowed.  Child care advocates are calling for a  wide-range of early childhood development services—from drop-in family resource centres, to part-time programs, to  pre-school services, to centre-based services, to school-age services. Services should  be available for children ranging from infants to 12-year olds.  Their vision is bolstered by recent early  childhood development research which  concludes that child care services offered  by trained staff are good for all children.  Bird says the goal is to achieve comprehensive, quality, accessible and affordable child care services, which meets the  needs of families in their communities.  The pan-Canadian child care initiative  that advocates are proposing, lays out the  roles of the two levels of government. The  federal government would be responsible  for setting up a national framework with  guiding principles, and for infusing cash  into the system. The provinces /territories  would be responsible for designing and  implementing the child care services, as  well as contributing funds to those programs.  CCAAC is proposing a phased-in, incremental approach, such as the one  adopted in Quebec. Under the Quebec  model, comprehensive child care services  were gradually implemented, starting with  five-year olds and working its way  younger. Now, the cost of child care to  parent(s) is just $5 per child per day; the  provincial government picks up the rest of  the tab.  "We don't need ten more pilot  projects," says Bird. "We need something  that builds towards a coordinated strategy."  Bird also stresses that advocates do not  want to see child care being used to force  women into the paid workforce—essentially, childcare for workfare (like "welfare  for workfare.")  Fall will be an important time for advocates to actively lobby provincial and  federal governments, agencies and bureaucrats around a pan-Canadian child care initiative.

"Children Can't Waif5  What is the National Children's Agenda?  Federal and provincial officials have been working on the National Children's  Agenda for three years, and on May 7th, a "vision statement" was released in  Saskatoon. The National Children's Agenda will shape the next federal budget, widely  expected to be the "Children's Budget," and may form the basis for social policy for  children for the next five to 10 years.  It will be up to us to make sure that the National Children's Agenda is more  than just another exercise in government rhetoric with a final report that is put on  the shelf. Therefore, it is critical that all politicians—federal, provincial and territorial—hear clear and coherent messages from all of us.  Our key messages to all governments  ♦ Children can't wait. The time for talk is past. Now it's time for action!  ♦ We in the community already share a vision for children: decent family income  and personal security; high quality early childhood education and care for all children; primary, secondary and further education; good health care; adequate housing; nutrition; a healthy environment; and a good quality of life. We invite our governments to share our vision.  ♦ We, in the community, are already working hard for children. We invite our governments to take action.  ♦ A real National Children's Agenda must have a multi-year budget. It will take  time and a commitrnent of resources over some years to enure that the Children's  Agenda is more than words.  ♦ A real National Children's Agenda is more than a single-fix solution. Children  need well-designed public policy, ensuring both income security and children's services to guarantee that they are recognized as "our country's strength today and in  the future."  ♦ An effective national strategy for developing integrated provincial systems ol  child care, early childhood education and parenting programs must be the centrepiece of a National Children's Agenda. As the National Council of Welfare stated:  "Many social programs support families, but child care is the backbone of them all."  Our key message to the federal government  We expect the federal government, as a signatory to the National Children's  Agenda, to demonstrate vision, political will and commitment to children in the  next federal budget. We call on it to commit to a multi-year Early Childhood Development Services Fund with a first year allocation of $2 billion to assist provincial/  territorial development of systems of Early Childhood Development Services.  Our key message to provincial/territorial governments  We expect provincial/territorial governments, as signatories to the National Children's Agenda, to demonstrate vision, political will and commitment to children in  their budgets. We call on them to make development of systems of Ea rly Childhood  Development Services a high priority by cooperating with the federal government  as well as by allocating their own resources.  What can you do?  1) Call, write and visit your federal member of parliament, and your provincial  representative.  2) Write letters to the Editor or OpEds, and call in to radio and TV shows, highlighting the key messages of the campaign.  3) Demand that there be a public hearing in your community on the National Children's Agenda.  4) Organize your own public meeting on what you want from the National Children's Agenda. Make sure that child care is a centrepiece of the discussion.  5) Be creative: invite your MP or MLA/MPP to visit your child care centre, your  parent meeting, your family resource centre.  6) Distribute information about the campaign to your colleagues, at meetings or  parent groups, et cetera.  The next three months are critical as the federal government develops its plans,  strategies and priorities leading to its next federal budget (February 2000). We must  start to advocate for what we want, and keep up the pressure. We must send a clear  message to both levels of government that "children can't wait"  For more information on how to get involved in the "Children Can't Wait" campaign,  contact the Child Care Advocacy Association of Canada, 323 Chapel St, 3rd Floor, Ottawa,  r 7Z2; tel: (613) 594-3196; fax: (613) 594-9375; email: CCAAC@istar.ca.  Kinesis means movement  SEPTEMBER 1999  KINESIS News  Violence against women in Quesnel, BC:  A line of their own  by Agnes Huang  For ten years, feminists in Quesnel  have been saying that there is a need for a  specific response line for women who have  been sexually assaulted.  For ten years, funders have responded:  "Where are the stats to prove it."  "How do you quantify that need?" asks  Char Harder-Sydenham, who worked for  many years on the community's crisis line.  She explains that many women who have  been sexually assaulted are reluctant to call  the crisis line because they don't know what  kind of response they will receive.  "If a woman calls the crisis line, she  would have to speak to whichever operator picks up the phone, rather than to someone who is trained in responding to her  specific support and advocacy needs," says  Harder-Sydenham.  The crisis line in Quesnel is a referral  line, and women who have been sexually  assaulted are referred to the police.  Quesnel, located in central British Columbia, has a population of about 25,000.  Of the communities nearby, only Prince  George—an hour's drive away—has any  services specifically for women who have  been sexually assaulted.  Instead of the crisis line, women in  Quesnel often turn to the local transition  house or women's centre. While providing  women with individual counselling and  support groups, these organizations do not  have the resources to provide them with  the constant advocacy they may need.  Even thoughper capita, Quesnel has the  most number of support services of a town  its size, Harder-Sydenham says there still  should be a sexual assault line in every  community.  "A woman who has been sexually assaulted is extremely vulnerable," she says.  "It's important that there is someone willing to take on an advocacy role so that she  won't have to explain her situation over  and over again to each agency she is referred to."  Five years ago, the Quesnel Women's  Resource Centre applied for grant monies  for a sexual assault response line from various government and other funders, but was  told there was no money for the initiative.  The Centre never let go of the importance of a sexual assault response line. Last  year, it decided to commit $10,000 of its  own money—from general revenue and  fundraising efforts—to make it happen.  In January, the task of setting up the  response line infrastructure, recruiting and  training volunteers, networking with other  support services in the community, and  promoting the sexual assault response line,  got underway. Harder-Sydenham was  hired on to coordinate the project.  The volunteer training program developed covers a wide-range of advocacy and  support information: from basic crisis intervention, to providing empathic response, to understanding specific  aftermaths for women who have been sexually assaulted.  Initially planned for 30 hours, the training stretched to 45 hours. Out of it, emerged  nine volunteers willing to be available on  an on-call basis.  As well as the incredible commitment  of volunteers, getting the response line going would not have been possible if members of the community hadn't lent their  support. Several local businesses donated  their services or offered discount rates.  "The local answering service gave us  a real deal," says Harder-Sydenham. The  hook-up of the phone line and advertising  were also provided for free.  On August 1st, the 24-hour-a-day,  seven-day-a-week sexual assault response  line in Quesnel became a reality.  Volunteers who take calls have specific  knowledge about how to most appropriately assist women who have been sexually assaulted. They not only provide advocacy and support over the phone, but  also face-to-face, if that's what the woman  wishes.  Before the response line started up,  there was no one constantly there to support women who had been sexually assaulted. Each agency (the RCMP, for example) provided the woman with the services  it offered, then passed her on to the next  agency (the Crown, for example), and so  on.  "We can provide a consistency of service, from start to finish," says Harder-  Sydenham. That means providing women  with emotional support and advocacy  throughout the whole process—from interacting with doctors or hospitals, the RCMP,  victims services, and the court system, to  accessing counselling and healing support,  and compensation under the Criminal Injuries CompensationAct.  One of the challenges in preparing the  training program for the response line was  safeguarding the relationship between the  women and the volunteer advocates.  Given concerns about the confidentiality and safety of women's personal  records, Harder-Sydenham says they did  some digging around to find out what the  Crown might ask the volunteers, to ensure  volunteers are not put in a position where  they would have to disclose their conversations with the women they were supporting.  "We wanted to make sure the volunteers could be with the women throughout,  and not be called as a witness at trial," she  says.  The threat of disclosure of a woman's  personal records—including her conversa  tions with an advocate—to the accused's  lawyer might deter her from speaking  openly about her situation, and from accessing support services.  Although the federal government introduced guidelines a few years back intended to put some restrictions on what  kinds of records can be requested by  defense lawyers, in many cases of sexual  assault, women and service providers are  still being forced to disclose personal and  confidential documents.  In fact, there are several cases heading  up the court levels, where men convicted  of sexual assault are challenging the constitutionality of the current disclosure laws.  Harder-Sydenham says to avoid these  scenarios, volunteers take information on  a need-to-know basis only. They focus on  how the woman feels—on her emotional  well-being—and not on the specifics of the  sexual assault incident(s). That way, the  volunteers won't have any information that  can be subpoenaed by defense lawyers,  which is most often used to question the  woman's "credibility."  Another issue that the sexual assault  response Une needs to address is the fact  that there are no First Nations women or  women of colour among its volunteers.  Harder-Sydenham acknowledges their involvement is a goal, and says she hopes  some will emerge from the next volunteer  training session, planned for late September or early October.  In the meantime, the Quesnel Women's  Resource Centre well continue to apply for  grant monies in order to keep the much  needed service provided by the sexual assault response line alive and expanding.

Facts about women in prison  In this issue of Kinesis, we present two articles related to women in prison, starting on page 11, and on page 12.  But first, here are some facts you should know about:  D Of the 218,000 adults charged with a crime in 1997-98, approximately 40,000 were women.  O Seventy-five percent of charges laid against women are for shoplifting or fraud, or for violations of drug or liquor regulations.  a In the last year, the number of women sentenced to a term in prison increased by 54 percent.  □ In the last year, approximately 9,000 women were sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  O Women make up, on average, nine percent of the prison population.  D Approximately 3,000 women are in prison on any given day.  O Women make up a small percentage of federally sentenced prisoners, that is with a sentence of two years or more. The reason is that women  are far less likely to commit or be convicted of serious crimes which result in sentences of two years or more. In 1998, there were 360 federally  sentenced women.  O More than half of all offenses that federally sentenced women are convicted for are non-violent. Acts of predatory violence by women are  extremely rare. Most acts of violence committed by women tend to be reactive or defensive in nature.  O In 1998,68 women were serving sentences for murder; of these, the majority killed an abusive man.  D Ninety-five percent of the women in prison are provincial prisoners, that is with a sentence of less than two years.  □ Of these women, over 30 percent are First Nations women, 6.5 percent are Afro-Canadian women, and 1.5 percent are identified as women  of Asian descent.  O First Nations women and women with "mental health issues" are disproportionately classified as maximum security ("high" risk) inmates.

KINESIS  SEPTEMBER 1999 What's News  compiled by Robyn Hall and Sally  Stevenson  Mary Daly: no room  of her own  Radical feminist Mary Daly, a professor at Boston College, has insisted that her  classes be women only for the past 20 years.  Her separatism, radical feminist theology,  and challenging word-spinning have been  a heated site of contention in the institution.  The author of seven books and holder  of three doctorate degrees, Daly has been  denied promotion and targeted for reprimands throughout her years at the Jesuit-  run Catholic university.  Two weeks ago, Boston College took  away Mary Daly's office. This blow comes  as one step in a series of efforts to force Daly  into retirement, at the age of 70.  Daly remarks: "It's symbolic...Think of  Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own—  that's what women have always needed  under patriarchy, and can't be creative without. They took away my classroom, and my  status to teach, and now they have taken  away my office...Virigina Woolf and I are  losing what I call 'women-space'."  In May, Daly sued the college for  breach of contract and violation of tenure  rights. She also requested that a judge order the school to write her back into the  course catalogues for classes beginning this  fall.  However, Judge Martha Sosman sided  with the college, stating: "A co-educational  institution of higher learning may insist that  all courses be open to both male and female students. A professor's defiance of  that policy...would give the school ample  grounds for her termination."  Daly's case against the university is  scheduled to go back to court in the summer of 2000. The trial will centre on Title  IX, a law against sexual discrimination at  federally funded schools.  The spokesman of Boston College, Jack  Dunn, described the university's position  on Daly: "We feel it's dangerous to condone  intolerance....You can't make an exception  for discrimination or intolerance. It's a slippery slope...and we refuse to do it. If this  were a white professor saying, T don't want  black students in my classroom,' obviously  we'd take the same position....It's fairness.  It's accessibility."  Dunn's parallel between barring male  students and black students from classrooms exposes a lack of awareness about  systemic power imbalances. A white instructor refusing to admit black students  into a classroom would be racism, not "unfairness." This act would also have to be  considered in connection with the historical reality of segregation.  Within the system of sexism, however,  males hold privilege. Mary Daly barring  men from her classrooms is not sexism: the  key component of what determines oppression is its systemic reality.  Megan Niziol, a former student of  Daly, argues that Daly's insistence on  women-only space is not about discrimination, it is about creating a learning environment with her female students where  "gynergy" is raised, energy which is smothered in mixed classrooms.  Daly's lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness, remarked that Daly's classroom separatism  is rooted in her lived experience of teaching within co-ed classroom dynamics, and  observations of the impact of these dynamics upon the students. Daly recently stated  that she is willing to teach men, but in separate classes.  The spark for the current struggles ignited when a male student at Boston College, Duane Naquin—who was not allowed  to register in Daly's class on feminist ethics  —complained to the administration at the  university and to the Center for Individual  Rights in Washington, an organization  which has been vocal and successful in its  challenges to affirmative action in several  states.  Both the administration and the Washington Centre have rallied around Naquin's  complaints. The spokesman of Boston College has stated that, since 1978, not one male  student has completed one of Daly's  classes. (So, who is this really a commentary about?)  Battered woman  denied asylum  A federal immigration panel in Washington, DC, recently ruled that a woman  from another country fleeing her husband's  violence is not eligible for asylum in the  United States.  For years, Rodi Alvarado Pena was  physically, sexually and emotionally  abused by her husband in Guatemala. Her  husband, a former solider, also utilized  weapons in his methods of intimidation  and torment.  After a suicide attempt, Alvarado  sought but was denied protection from  Guatemalan police and courts, who referred to her husband's violence as a private matter. Seeking an end to the abuse,  Alvarado left Guatemala, arriving in the US  in 1995. Since then, she has been employed  as a domestic worker in San Francisco.  In 1996, an immigration judge granted  Alvarado her asylum claim. Recently, however, the Board of Immigration Appeals  ruled—in a 10 to five decision—that  Alvarado does not qualify for asylum under US immigration policy.  They maintained she had not proven  that she had experienced persecution under any of the five categories enumerated  under international and US law: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group.  The five board members who contested the ruling argued that the board's  refusal to recognize battered women in  Guatemala as a social group "cannot be  reconciled either with the reality of the respondent's situation in Guatemala or with  US law." They maintained that the United  States is obligated to grant asylum to those  who fear harm in relation to "some fundamental aspect of their identity."  The Immigration and Naturalization  Service created guidelines—in 1995 — designed to facilitate recognition of gender-  based persecution under the asylum laws.  These guidelines, however, have been erratically interpreted and applied.  Alvarado's attorney will appeal this  ruling to a federal court.  [Source: off our backs, July 1999]  Violence against  women in Sri Lanka  The International Secretariat of OMCT  (Organisation Mondiale Contre la Torture)  requests urgent protests of the brutal killing of a 21-year Sri Lankan woman on July  12, allegedly by soldiers.  According to reports, five heavily  armed, masked men entered the home of  Ida Caremellita at night while she and her  family slept. She was taken out of the house,  raped and killed. Two of those involved  were identified and taken into custody.  Members of her family were or are  members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam (LTTE). One brother is now in army  custody, while two more were killed by  members of an anti-LTTE group.  Caremelitta had been involved with  the LTTE, but left it to rejoin her family in  1998. When she returned to her village  Pallimunai, which is under army control,  she surrendered, was interrogated, then released.  Her rape and murder is one example  of continued reports of the torture and rape  of women and young girls by soldiers during the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka.  Women are urged to write to Sri  Lankan authorities to urge them to:  □ guarantee an impartial and exhaustive inquiry into the rape and killing of Ida  Caremelitta, bring those reponsible before  a competent and impartial tribunal and  apply the penal, civil and administrative  sanctions provided by law;  □ guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of the family of Ida  Caremelitta and ensure them the right to  adequate reparation;  □ adopt immediate measures to put  an end to these acts of torture and killings;  and  □ ensure in all circumstances respect  for human rights and fundamental  freedoms in accordance with national laws  and international human rights standards.

SEPTEMBER 1999 What's News  Lesbian couple in  Brazil seeks redress  Against a backdrop of increased police  violence and torture, and anti-gay violence,  a Brazilian lesbian couple is seeking redress  from the Supreme Court of Brazil for physical and psychological torture that occurred  while they were held in police custody in  1996. They were incarcerated for 11 months.  Rosana Lage Ligero and Marli Jose da  Silva Barbosa were living openly as lesbians when they were arrested, and charged  with being the "intellectual authors" of the  murder of Mrs. Joseth Pessoa de Siqueira.  The arrest was reportedly based on the single testimony of a neighbour who told police Lage Ligero and Barbosa had paid two  men to kill the victim.  While held in police custody, the  women were physically and verbally  abused for their lesbianism. They were released from prison after a medical examination confirmed their police beatings.  They are now awaiting a review of their  case by Brazil's Supreme Court.  The International Gay and Lesbian  Human Rights Commission is concerned  the women were wrongfully arrested as a  result of their sexual orientation. The case  underscores an alarming pattern of human  rights violations, such as extortions, beatings and home invasions, aimed at gay,  lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people by the Brazilian Civil Police.  Lage Ligero and Barbosa are asking the  international human rights community to  write letters, especially to the Ministry of  Justice, urging it to:  □ Carry out a thorough investigation  into their case and the reported violations  of due legal process to enable the Supreme  Court to adequately review the case and  grant the women a fair and expeditious  hearing.  □ Fully and impartially investigate the  torture and violence used by the police officers of Jaboatao dos Guararpes against  Lage Ligero and Barbosa while held in custody.  □ Take legal action against those officers responsible for the acts of brutality  to which the couple were subjected as a result of their gender and sexual orientation.

Domestic workers'  rights unsafe in HK  The Labour Department in Hong Kong  is proposing to pass a law that abolishes  maternity protection for Hong Kong domestic workers. Both local and migrant  workers will be affected by the changes.  Currently, all women workers in Hong  Kong have maternity protection, which  states that it is illegal to dismiss a worker  after notice of their pregnancy or before,  during and after their maternity leave.  Workers are now entitled to maternity leave  and maternity pay, and cannot be subjected  to excess work during their pregancy period.  The Labour Department claims that  live-in domestic work is a "special" category of work and therefore does not deserve protection. A pregnant domestic  worker is considered an "inconvenience"  to their employer, and the government believes a mutually agreeable dismissal  should be the result.  This development is of concern to all  women workers in Hong Kong because it  represents only one recent example of the  Hong Kong government's erosion of rights  of women. Last December, the government  enforced a wage cut on foreign domestic  workers.  There are currently several petitions  circulating opposing the proposed changes  to the labour laws.  For more information about the law and  petitions contact Peggy Lee by email at  i.hku.hk.  Union-busting in  Honduras  After a struggle of two-and-a-half  years, workers at the Korean-owned Kimi  maquiladora factory in Lima, Honduras  (near San Pedro Sula) achieved a first collective agreement on March 19. The agreement did not provide for major improvements in wages and working conditions,  but it did create possibilities for future improvements. The agreement was also significant as it is the first union contract to be  won in the Continental Industrial Park, located in a "free trade zone."  Less than one month after the Kimi  workers' victory, however, Jaime  Rosenthal—the owner of the industrial  park—threatened not to renew the lease for  the factory. Rosenthal is the head of one of  the most powerful families in Honduras,  and is standing as a candidate for the presidency in next year's election. Rosenthal has  publicly alluded to his intention of keeping his industrial park union-free.  In response to Rosenthal's threats,  Kimi management signed a contract to  move production to a new location far from  the Continental Industrial Park. Both the  workers and their union are concerned  about the distance between the new factory  location and the communities where the  workers live. If it happens, many will be  unable to continue working for the company. They fear the move might be a convenient way of getting rid of union supporters and busting the union.  Action requested: Please fax or mail a letter of protest to Ing. Jaime Rosenthal, ZIP Continental, PO Box 390, San Pedro Sula, Cortes,  Honduras; fax: Oll-(504) 550-2750.  Rape in refugee camps  Several million refugees who fled  fighting and famine in Somalia eight years  ago now face violence in refugee camps.  And women are the targets of much of that  violence.  United Nations officials—connected  with the Ifo, Hagadera and Dagahaley  camps in Kenya— report that rapes currently occur 75 times more often than  would be expected in a community of  100,000. At a refugee camp in Tanzania,  approximately one-fourth of the women  have been raped since arriving at the camp,  says Refugees International, a group based  in Washington, DC. As most rapes are not  reported, however, these figures are likely  to be underestimates.  One of the "women's chores" in the  camps entails gathering firewood in the  forests; while in the forest, however, the  chances of being targeted for rape increases.  In response to a growing awareness of the  link between the forest chores and the  rapes, and as a result of public pressure,  the UN High Commissioner on Refugees  requested money to buy firewood for the  camps. That was in 1997.  Although the US State Department  contributed some money, they only gave  enough to meet approximately one-third of  the camps' firewood needs. (Obviously, the  American government doesn't consider  Somali refugees—particularly women who  are raped—to be a priority.)  The number of rapes did decrease  drastically once women no longer had to  venture into the forest to collect firewood.  However, the money for firewood has  nearly run out.  [Source: off our backs, July 1999]  Guatemalan workers  threatened  Since being told last December that  Phillips-Van Heusen (P-VH), an American  multi-national corporation, was closing its  Camisas Modernas factory in Guatemala,  P-VH workers have maintained a 24-hour  vigil outside the factory to prevent the  equipment from being removed.  In June, P-VH union leader Marisol  Lopez visited the United States to win support for the workers' struggle. She tried to  bring their case to a P-VH shareholders  meeting, and to present the company's  CEO, Bruce Klatsky, with a report proving  that his company has shifted production  from Camisas Modernas to non-union  sweatshops in Guatemala.  The day after Lopez delivered her message, her husband, Mario Naves, reported  that he had received a death threat phone  call in Guatemala. The caller, who refused  to identify himself, told Naves that he had  been contracted to kill the Lopez family,  and that the P-VH workers camped in front  of the closed factory should cease their activities immediately or they would all end  up dead.  Naves has filed a complaint with the  Guatemalan Public Ministry and with  MINUGUA, the United Nations agency  monitoring implementation of the peace  accords.  While no one is accusing P-VH of orchestrating death threats, speculation is that  others with vested interests in keeping unions out of Guatemala's maquila sector are  involved.  Lopez and other labour activists says  that, by reopening the factory and reinstating the workers, P-VH can resolve the situation which lead to death threats.  Action Requested: Please fax or mail a letter to Phillips-Van Heusen CEO Bruce Klatsky,  urging him to reopen the Camisas Modernas  factory, reinstate the workers, recognize the  union, and accept a collective agreement. He  can be reach at Phillips-Van Heusen, 200 Madison Ave, New York, New York, 10016; fax:  (212) 381-3970.  *-->  ^-tHSO UVKD       HV5TERV6S        SotV^H      Att    KH4E3IS ^  K J*0 ^S.

Over the  next year, Kinesis will continue to bring our  readers coverage of the organizing activities  leading up to the March and the events and  campaigns that take place during the seven  months of the March itself (from March 8th to  October 17th.)  This piece below is reprinted from the  World March newsletter, July 1999, Volume  2, Numberl. For a background information on  the World March or for a list and explanation  of the key demands towards ending poverty and  violence against women, visit the World March  website or look inside the April 1999 issue of  Kinesis.  The World March Year 2000 is the occasion to unite in planet-wide action, while  at the same time taking part in national and  local actions reflecting our particular characteristics and our diversity.  As agreed at the International Preparatory Meeting (October 1998 in Montreal),  the International Liaison Committee studied the action scenarios for the worldwide  scale. They are now taking shape. Thanks  to exchanges with International Liaison  Committee members and with a number  of national coordinating bodies, we have  now defined the targets of the world actions, the venue for the world rally, the form  the support card will have and the world  slogan.  Get in touch;  keep in touch  Currently, the World March is only accepting memberships from organizations  and groups. If you are an individual wishing to get involved, get in touch with local  women's groups in your area and find out  if they've connected up with the March. (If  they aren't, encourage them to do so. It's  really easy) Or you can contact a member  group of the Canadian national coordination committee. That committee is being  led by the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (416-932-1718) and  the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women (613-563-0681).  For a list of groups that have already  signed on, check out the World March website. There's already more than 2,200 in  138 countries!

Three main international bodies emerged from the exchange: the United  Nations in New York, and the World Bank  and International Monetary Fund, both in  Washington.  It was decided that an international  delegation will be present in Washington  on Sunday, October 15, 2000, for the US  women's national rally. Part of this march  will parade outside the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund. Then, the  international delegation will travel to New  York for the world rally outside the UN  building on October 17.  This way, the March will challenge  important strategic bodies representing  both economic and political power on the  international scene.  Millions of signatures expected  A signature campaign to support the  world demands will begin on March 8,2000  and end when the cards are delivered at  the UN on October 17,2000.  You will appreciate that it is impossible for us to print and send the support  cards to all the participating groups. The  task of printing and distributing the cards  will have to fall to the national coordinating bodies and participating groups themselves. Thus you will be able to print the  Important dates for all  □ as of now: Setting up national  coordinating bodies (if not already done);  □ as of now: National meetings to decide  on national demands and actions  (ideally, this should be done before  November 1999 so as to send the  information to your regional representative who will relay it to the meeting of the  International Liaison Committee);  D  from now to June 2000: Regional  meetings in preparation for Beijing +5  (if you attend the event, don't forget to  talk about the March and to propose that  it be adopted as a pressure tactic to  enhance the Beijing platform);  □ October-November 1999: Sample  support cards will be sent out;  □ November 1999: Working meeting of  the International Liaison Committee;  D  January 2000: Tribute to Women's  Struggles Worldwide" will be sent out;  □ March 8,2000: World March activities  will be launched in the media;  □ March 8 to October 17: Signing of  support cards, popular education  activities and different local, national  and regional actions;  □ June 2000: Beijing + 5 international  meeting;  □ October 1 -17,2000 (or before, depending on the country): Local, national and  regional marches and rallies;  □ October 15: Rally in Washington  □ October 17,2000: World rally in New  York and national and local activities.  cards in the language and format of your  choice. Part of the card content will be common to all, however.  Two card formats are proposed: the  postcard and the group/petition card.  Some groups suggested printing a detachable card, with one part being used for national actions and the other to send to New  York. We recommend that you use recycled  paper as often as possible, but your card  does not have to be made out of paper.  Be creative-without forgetting that the  cards must be sent to New York and so,  small, lightweight cards are to be preferred!  Before January 2000 we will send you a  sample support card indicating the common content (logo and short text) that  should appear.  We urge you to contact your national  coordinating body to see about organizing  the support card campaign in your country. If there is no such body where you live,  you can join other participating groups  from your country or region to design and  print or photocopy your card. Participating groups and national coordinating bodies will take charge of distributing, collecting and compiling the cards in their region.  At the present time, we are looking at different options to facilitate sending the cards  to New York.  To make sure we collect as many signatures as possible to support the demands,  two complementary distribution strategies  will be used: inserting the card in the print  media (magazines, et cetera) and creating a  page on the World March Web site so that  women with access to Internet can include  their names. We encourage you to explore  the feasibility of inserting support cards,  together with articles about the March, in  the print media of your country and region.  You could begin discussing approaches or strategies to ensure widespread  distribution and to maximize the number  of signatures. Once again, creativity will  take centre stage!  2000 good reasons to march:....  We tried to find a world slogan with  which women could identify. It soon became apparent that finding a symbol common to the living conditions of the women  of the world was impossible. We did however come up with a compromise! The slogan "2000 good reasons to march" was chosen with a colon (:) at the end so that each  country can add on its national slogan reflecting its own circumstances and the living conditions women hope for.  For example, Burkina Faso's slogan  could be tacked on to the world slogan, as  follows: "2000 good reasons to march: Djii,  suuma, neema" (Water, food, plenitude).  We encourage all participating groups  to use this presentation of "2000 good reasons to march" on their materials in order  to standardize the message and to feel that  we are all part of the same fine, large movement.  An "Advocacy Guide to  Women's World Demands'  The Coordinating Committee of  the World March of Women has put  together an 'Advocacy Guide to  Women's World Demands" to help  women get ready for the big day(s).  The Guide is a tool for individuals  or women's groups who will be  working with women at the grassroots level, making presentations at  special events of lobbying their governments and regional or international bodies.  The Guide starts off by putting  the demands-focusing on ending  poverty and violence against  women-of the World March in their  social, economic and political context The Guide then explains each  demand from a feminist perspective.  Each woman or group is invited  to adapt elements of the analysis  presented in the Guide according to  how it relates to their work, and to  flesh out the analysis based on their  own particular situation or context.  Finally, the Guide links the various elements of the Beijing Platform  for Action to the demands of the  March. There is also an appendix  with useful information and definitions on political, economic and legal institutions to help women better understand the demands of the  World March.  As there are many challenges in  covering the issues and analyses adequately, the Coordinating Committee acknowledges there may be  shortcoming to the Guide. The  Committee sees the Guide as a  work-in-progress and encourages  women to enrich the text from their  own viewpoint, based on their own  realities. As they say, "this Guide  [is] a collective work in constant  evolution."  For a copy of the Advocacy  Guide, contact the World March organizers or visit their website.

The gently rolling,  wooded land was purchased in December  1998, freeing women to begin the exciting  work of building, teaching, learning and  celebrating.  Phase I of the Land Project will be the  creation of accommodations for rustic  camping and informal groups, and will include the creation of a site plan, improving  roads, clearing land for camping, installing sanitary facilities and showers and  building cabins and residences.  MAAT Dompin is a federally recognized, non-profit, community-based organization in the United States. It was able  to pay $30,000 of the $50,000 purchase price  for the land through a grant from the Lesbian Natural Resource and the contributions of many generous donors. Many  women have already contributed much  time, money, advice and support to bring  the project to this point.  Community support is still necessary  for the organization to survive and grow.  MAAT Dompin needs ongoing tax-deductible donations for materials, labour and  operating costs, and mortgage payments.  MAAT Dompin is for women of colour, their friends and lovers. Interested  women are invited to visit and participate.  To connect up with MAAT Dompim, contact them at PO Box 7724, Charlottesville, VA  22906; or by voice mail at (540) 992-1248.  Help free Stacey  Lannert  Stacey Lannert was 17-years old when  she shot and killed her father in a defensive response to many years of physical and  sexual abuse. She is now 27 and has already  served nine years of a life sentence (without the possibility of parole).  Lannert has tried to appeal her case to  higher courts, but was unsuccessful. The  only avenue of appeal left to her now is a  pardon from the Governor of her home  state of Missouri. Her supporters are calling on individuals to urge the Governor to  repond to an appeal for clemency now on  his desk, and issue a pardon.  As well as abusing Lannert, her father  had threatened to abuse her younger sister  if Lannert left home, as she had turned the  legal age to move out. On the day of the  shooting, he had attacked her sister and had  been shooting at them. There are bullet  holes still in the walls.  At her trial, the police argued that  Lannert killed her father for money, even  though his estate was quite small. The police also refused to collect any evidence of  abuse, and those who could have testified  about the abuse refused to assist her.  Although Lannert has been demonized  as evil and crazy and is now imprisoned,  she is attempting to make the most of her  restricted life. She has achieved much personal recovery from the years of abuse by  her father.  To express your belief that Stacey Lannert  should be pardoned, send letters to Governor  Carnahan of Missouri: PO Box 720, Jefferson  City, MO, 65102-1720.

Meeting of feminist  anti-violence workers  Feminist anti-violence workers across  British Columbia will come together in Vancouver in late September (around Take Back  the Night) to discuss past, current and future strategies towards ending violence  against women.  Hosted by the Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter, as a member of the  Canadian Association of Sexual Assault  Centres, and the Feminist Alliance of Transition Houses, the two day meeting on September 25 and 26 will feature as guest presenters Andrea Dworkin and Sheila  Jeffreys.  Dworkin is well-known as a feminist  anti-violence and anti-pornography activist from the United States. (She will also  speak at the Take Back the Night rally in  Vancouver, [see Bulletin Board for details.J)  A senior lecturer in political science at the  University of Melbourne, Jeffreys has most  recently been been doing work around the  issue of prostitution.  Plan to attend the meeting to:  ♦ get informed about anti-violence  work happening in BC;  ♦ compare notes to build a shared  understanding of violence against  women and the forces working  against us in BC, Canada and  internationally;  ♦ plan for how to stay connected and  increase the mutual support  required to keep the women's  movement alive and kicking;  ♦ strategize and look ahead to the  work of the next ten years  including advocacy tactics for the  women calling crisis centres;  ♦ launch anti-violence campaigns in  local communities; and  ♦ mobilize women in BC's local  communities to participate in the  World March 2000 to eliminate  poverty and violence against  Women are invited to share ideas for  workshops, discussion topics and speakers,  and to contribute articles or papers for the  information packages to be sent to conference participants.  Participants will also Take Back the  Night on Saturday night with the women  of Vancouver.

UVIC Women's  Studies turns 20  The University of Victoria offered its  first class in Women's Studies 20 years ago  this year. To celebrate, the department will  be hosting a series of events over the 1999-  2000 academic year.  The first celebration will take place  from October 18 to 25, with Carribean-Ca-  nadian writer and community activist  Makeda Silvera visiting UVic as a  Lansdowne Scholar. She is also one of the  founders of Toronto's Sister Vision Press:  Black Women and Women of Colour Press.  Silvera will present a public reading of  her work on October 22nd and take part in  a panel workshop called, "Visions of Social Justice for the Millennium" on October 23rd.  Other plans for the year include a  Women's Studies weekend reunion in January 2000 for former students, faculty and  staff, which will include speakers, art performances and partying. Also in the planning stages (and depending on interest), is  a Women's Studies summer camp to take  place in July or August 2000. The week-long  event would include workshops as well as  fun and creative activities.  If you are one of the 3,383 students to  have taken women's studies courses at  UVic, you are encouraged to email the department at wsanniv@uvic.ca with your  current contact information.

The  pro-active project encompassed education,  skills-building and awareness raising.  The goal of the project was to help prevent violence against women and girls by  providing early education for youth. A  growing body of research links childhood  bullying behaviour to adolescent sexual  violence and harassment.  Along with the participation of a  Project Coordinator, Project Facilitator,  adult workshop facilitators and a Youth  Coordinator, four youth were a part of the  project team. The youth were trained in violence prevention leadership and were able  to deliver a strong message of anti-violence  to their peers and younger children.  The project team conducted age-appropriate workshops on violence prevention  for children from kindergarten through  Grade 12. A violence prevention Activity  Book was created for six, seven and eight-  year-old students in the school district.  At the high school on Salt Spring, the  entire student population participated in a  "Freedom from Fear Day." In addition,  various events marking the December 6th  National Day of Remembrance of Violence  against Women, and International Women's  Day were held.  The project was coordinated jointly by  Salt Spring Women Opposed to Violence  and Abuse, Community Development and  Research Society (SWOVA) and School District #64. Funding was received from the  BC Ministry of Women's Equality.

The cost of the report is $5.00 to  cover photocopying and postage.  Gazebo looks back on  19 years  Almost 20 years ago, a lone Vancouver lesbian was looking for places to meet  women outside of the bar scene and came  up with...nothing. After talking to several  women about the idea of forming a lesbian  social club and meeting with much negativity, she finally met another woman who  was equally enthusiastic about the idea.  Joined by five others, they formed Gazebo,  a lesbian social group that has grown to be  a meeting place for over 300 members and  friends since 1980.  Gazebo's first event was a dance at the  Gazebo restaurant in 1980, which sold out.  It was the first of many successful dances  and events held in the years since. Beyond  dances, the group has organized activities  such as hiking, golf, bowling, camping, and  women's choras.  After a couple of years, the organization expanded, forming committees, including the Issues Committee that presented briefs and letters advocating for lesbian rights to the federal and provincial  governments. Gazebo has also made financial donations to more politically active  groups like EGALE (Equality for Gays and  Lesbians Everywhere) and the Vancouver  Lesbian Connection (now defunct).  Gazebo will be holding an Anniversary  Dinner and Dance on September 18 at the  Stanley Park Pavilion. Tickets are $32 for  members and $38 for non-members. (Reservation deadline is September 11.)

WOMEN UNITE  TAKE BACK  THE  MIGHT  in Vancouver  Saturday, September 25  7:00pm  at  the Vancouver Art Gallery  (Georgia St. side)  For more info:  call Rape Relief at  (604) 872-8212  SEPTEMBER 1999 Feature  Leaving:  interviews with women who have left  abusive relationships  a study by Angela MacRae   You need to get out, but how? Many  things surround the issue of leaving an  abusive partner-not knowing where to  go, how to access support and much  more. I thought there needed to be more  information on what it is really like to  live with abuse and to leave. This is what  I am hoping to give you.  1 wrote this publication to tell my  story of leaving abuse and the lessons  learned from nine women I interviewed.  I did all this during a short five-week job  placement through the Vancouver Island  Public Research Group (VIPIRG). I was  enrolled in ORCA, the job-training program at Esquimalt Neighbourhood  House, when I phoned VIPIRG asking for  experience in being a researcher. When  they told me to choose a subject that was  close to me-something based on my own  experience-I knew this is what I wanted  to do.  Over the month, I worked with the  staff at VIPIRG to conduct the interviews  and write this report. I hope it can help  others.  If you, or someone you know, needs  help to leave an abusive relationship,  there are people and places to help them.  You can call 911 or just look at the first  page in your phone book for the phone  number of a transition house in your  area.  Methodology  In this report, you will read about  nine women I interviewed, and I will also  tell you my story and thoughts. We are  all women who have been abused, and  who have left. Before I started interviewing, the researcher at VIPIRG assisted me  in creating consent forms and an interview guide. Finding the women was easy;  they were all friends or women I had met  in my job training program.  The nine women come from a variety of backgrounds and different cultures. Their ages range from 24 to 41  years old. They are all mothers; most  having one or two school-age children.  While one woman is working full-time,  the other women's income is social assistance or disability. Five of the women  graduated from high school and four  have completed Grade 11. All the women  live in poverty.  Their abusive relationships were between one-and-a-half years to 13 years  in duration. Some were married; some  not. One was abused by her pimp/boyfriend. And now, some are single; others  in new relationships. None are remarried.  Some of the women smoke pot;  some have piercings in different places;  and some seem like the girl-next-door.  Yet, we all have a commonality that links  us together.  Some of these women show such  great strength that I look up to them with  great respect. Others still seem at odds  with who they are and their place in this  world.  I am extremely thankful for their  time and openness for all of us to see.  Now, after interviewing these women and  writing this report, I feel I am making a  contribution to helping other women.  ^If8rj  1 was living common law with my ex  for just over a year, when he snapped one  day over a discussion about buying a  home. He beat me black and blue. My  surrogate mother made me call the police. A report was made and my ex was  escorted out.  Not long after, he moved out. It was  hell. I couldn't sleep, eat, anything. My  sister had to hold me so I could sleep.  Pain is in my heart as I recall those days.  He moved out, but the abuse became  worse, and he became more controlling.  Not until I truly moved away did 1 become free. Even then, for almost a year  after, he still tried to control me by  phone. I bought into it, and would sit  there shaking, crying on the phone, and  hating it all.  After seven years, I told him "no  more" and stuck by it. Seven years is a  long time in one's life.  I had no idea where to go. The police seemed anything but helpful. I let  my children see the abuse, and excused  it. My son would hold me at three years  of age and tell me, "It is okay Mommy,  Daddy is gone. He can't hurt you  anymore."  My children became the adults of the  relationship. Children, whether they are  also being hit, yelled at, or put down, are  also victims-small, unheard victims. The  behaviour becomes a part of them.  I had to give up my son to my sister  because I could not handle his anger. It  became a battle of wills: me against him.  Our relationship will never be the same.  Sometimes it  takes more than  one try^  I was happy to find that many of the  women never returned to their abusive  relationship. Yet, there were some who  did. Why, I asked? "Because he made all  these promises." "I thought I could  change him!" more than one woman answered. Other common answers were. "I  didn't think I could do any better" and "I  thought I was in love."  For all the women who returned, the  relationship fell apart and the abuse became much worse.  a study by  Angcld lldcRdc  with help from  Bruce Wallace & Stacy Chappel  from the Vancouver Island Public Interest Research Group  fhy do mm  abuse us?  What the women thought the reasons ranged from drinking, drugs, pregnancy, to jealousy over the kids, upbring-  ing-the way they were parented-and  even one who felt she was the rightful  property of her pimp. None of these are  acceptable reasons for abuse. Remember,  there is no excuse for abuse.  My story  My ex became abusive the same day  I first found out I was pregnant. He  punched me in the stomach. Other men  had hit me many times before, but he  seemed so perfect. When he apologized  profusely, I was okay. Hey, I got roses and  cards.  For a while, this went on. 1 was unsure. I had been taught to stick with the  relationship no matter what. I figured  once the baby was born that he would  be okay. I was wrong; it got worse.  Eventually, there were no more rose  or cards, then no more apologies. He began to blame me. I thought I could  change, and make him happy.  Out of desperation, at five months  pregnant, I attempted suicide. Taking  over 100 pills, I came close to ending it  all. Again, my surrogate mother was the  one to find me and take me to the hospital. As they tried to pump my stomach,  I kept pulling out the tubes. I wanted it  all to end.  My ex didn't care. He never came to  the hospital, or even called. In fact, I was  more upset because no one would tell  me where he was.  Once the baby was born, I let him  walk all over me. I was at a loss of how  to go on alone. No one would want someone with two kids. As the kids got older,  the abuse grew harder. He would drag  my kids from bed to upset me and shame  me. The kids were definitely a sore spot  in our relationship. But I thought if I  loved him enough and our child enough,  it would change. It never did.  g&  Many women don't know where to  turn to get help when they want to leave.  Out of the nine women I interviewed,  only three women knew of services to  contact when they most needed them.  One woman said, "I was unaware of any  services until I did volunteer work; then  I got private counselling." (Which, I  would like to add, she had to pay for  herself with child tax credit money.  Which somehow seems wrong to me.)  The women who did know of services, knew of the police, two knew of  transition houses, and one knew of a  military padre. At some point, these  women did find out about services to  help. However, they travelled a long  road-a road that I feel needed more options, or possibly just more information  on the options available.  My desire is for there to be recognition of the lack of publicity about places  to go in crisis. We can help stop the violence by opening up everyone's eyes to  these services and stop condoning abuse  in society.  Although many women related their  very negative experiences with the police, only the police have the ability to  take the abuse away, give you time to get  out, create a record [of his above] and  provide victim services.  "They don't tell ya nothing; there is  no justice system," was the comment of  one woman. Yet, there were a couple of  women who found the police to be helpful. Some women would like to see them  get better sensitivity training, to better  understand and help women in abusive  circumstances. It was mentioned a few  see LEAVING next page  SEPTEMBER 1999 Feature  from LEAVING previous page  times though that the police were an essential tool in getting a protective order  and also to have a record.  In the end, no matter what is said,  the police are of a great value to victims  of abuse.  As for the Ministry for Children and  Families, only a couple of women commented on it. They were not positive  comments, however, because the Ministry's involvement [in their situations] was  because the women's children had been  apprehended.  Finally, transition houses. I was surprised to discover that many women  knew nothing about transition houses  when they were leaving their relationship. Yet, the ones who did go to a transition house found it very helpful. In fact  the number one recommendation from  these women was that they would like  to see more transition houses, and more  advertising, education and accessibility  to transition houses and other programs  for women who are leaving.  My story  I laugh when I think about my experience with the police. They were so  casual and aloof about everything. When  my partner threatened to slash my throat  and admitted it to the police, they said  he was very calm and believed he would  not hurt me. Why? Because he is an excellent actor and was calm in saying he  would kill me?  In my many dealings with the police,  I have to admit I was anything but satisfied with their part in all of it. Through  their ignorance, my ex went on to make  [his abuse] a joke. Even my kids thought  you could get away from the police by  being "innocent" enough.  I, too, was involved with the Ministry for Children and Families. I have to  say I was both happy and disappointed  with their services. I found that it pretty  much took someone reporting you to  them, before they would help.  A transition house was not an option for me because of the many negative stories I had heard about them. Now  I know differently. I have seen the help  they were able to provide for women.  They allowed the women I talked to to  become stronger, and helped them to get  set up from the ground up.  As I said before, it took me another  year of being alone to finally begin to  grow into my own. If it seems like the  pain will never end; it will. I have a journal that I write in always. I would recommend this to anyone. Being able to look  back and see where you were, and where  you've come, can be of great assistance.  Having been out on my own, I have  come to know of many services, and have  benefited from being involved in them. I  agree with the one woman who said, "The  more people as you can tell, the better."  By knowing what services do exist and  how we can better improve them, we are  making huge strides in the fight against  abuse. Who knows what needs to change  than those of us who have been there?  I know that many women suffer from  the effects of their abuse even years after they have left. They still fear being  put down, hit, et cetera. We come to expect it after years of having been there.  I still jump when someone comes  from behind. I still flinch when someone  moves too fast or unexpectedly. An ex  ample of this would be, one night while  in bed with a lover, he went to kiss me.  My reaction was to jump and burst into  tears. His fast movement made me think  he was going to hit me. He was shocked  to say the least and explained he would  never hit me; he only wanted to kiss me.  This is an example of how, even after you  leave, the protective measures once  needed before stay with you.  Life    after    we  leO¥€L.  All nine women I interviewed are  now working on either furthering their  education or their careers. They say they  now feel more independent and free.  Some comments were:  "I now have the courage to do  things myself."  "I am quite happy. Don't have a  job yet, but I can smell one."  "Got my power back! I'm in a  relationship where I can express  my emotions openly."  "I'm still hesitant about men; my  life though is 100 percent  better than it was."  "I can do what I put my mind  to, thanks to 'Bridges' [an  employment training program  for women.]"  "I'm working on my career and l"rr  going to do it."  "Fucking great! I'm positive and  don't allow abuse near me  anymore."  Afterword  As for my life at this time, I am 26  years old, single and not sure I want to  change that. I still have a lot of apprehension when it comes to men. I fear retaliation. I am learning to be a better parent.  My son and I have lost an important  part of our relationship that can never  be replaced. Yet, as each day goes on, I  am thankful that he still loves me and  calls me mom. (Although, at this time,  he also calls his aunt, "mom." It is something I struggle with and hope to one  day accept.)  My daughters are everything to me.  They're growing up so fast, and I feel  pain and fear of once again being truly  alone. I hope that in time being alone  will not seem so bad.  I am on medication for my depression, and it has been three years since I  last attempted suicide. I will have been  sober a year in July and this too is a  struggle.  I have become stronger with every  course I take, and every friend I make. I  journal everyday, and at times, go back  and read the past. I can then see how  far I really have come. I do struggle with  obsession compulsion, but am working  to alleviate this.  I have a small group of friends; many  who have been in the same sort of situations. In fact, there are many of the  women I interviewed. As one becomes  involved in support programs, you develop strong emotional ties and friendships to those who have also been in  your circumstances.  My relationships with past friends  are not there so much anymore. As you  leave the abuse, you come to recognize  that some friendships could be contributing factors. I want to have nothing to  do with negativity. I have enough negativity in myself that I don't need to have  it with others.  I feel that I still have much growth  and strength to get back. But just as it  took years of abuse to lose my strength;  it will take years to regain. I live for today, and try not to worry about tomorrow.  My philosophy is "baby steps." Where  there is a will, there will surely always be  a way.  I am entering college in the fall. Sociology will be my focus; my interest is  women and children. "Give back to the  community what it will give to you, and  you will benefit from many rewards," is  'what I believe.  I hope to continue studies at the  University of Victoria and do my major  in sociology. I want personally to make a  difference. I am happy despite the many  bumps in my road. I continue to learn,  and will continue to grow.  Writing this report has been much  harder than I had first anticipated. Talking to others and hearing their stories  was easy. However, going back and reliving my pain was hard and exhausting.  Yet, I feel that one can only truly understand if you can see where I am coming  from. I would like to see that all services  are available to anyone who needs them  and that they can easily find those services. By writing our story, I hope this will  be a step in that direction.

SEPTEMBER 1999 Feature  Women and the prison system in Canada:  Turning back the clock  by Frances Foran  Three years after a scathing report  called for a complete overhaul of the women's prison system, Correctional Services of  Canada (CSC) has reverted back to the custodial conditions of the last century, says  the director of a national women's organization that advocates for women in trouble with the law.  Right now, approximately 36 women  are incarcerated in segregated units in  men's prisons around the country. Most  have been there for almost two years. The  same practice was used 100 years ago, until public concern over the severe abuse of  women in the men's prison in Kingston,  Ontario led to the construction of the Kingston Prison for Women (P4W) in 1934.  "There's definitely been a backlash,"  says Kim Pate of Canadian Association of  Elizabeth Fry Societies (CAEFS). "The  Prison for Women was built to get women  out of men's prisons and now Corrections  is back where it started."  Pate and other prisoner rights activists  are appalled at Corrections' regressive  move after building five new $30 million  prisons for women over the last decade.  Phillis Iverson of the prisoners'support  group Joint Effort is concerned that the  women are being denied access to facilities  and provisions in the men's maximum security prisons. Maximum security prisons  are internally divided and fortified, and prisoners have less mobility and fewer privileges.  Moreover, she says, most of the women  have histories of abuse, some are coping with  the psychological effects of trauma, and their  confinement in a men's segregation unit is  not in the best interest of their well-being.  Iverson rejects CSC's claim that the  women's alleged mental health problems justify their segregation within maximum security prisons. "How does putting them in  maximum security address these women's  mental health issues? If a prison is supposed  to work for their eventual release back into  the community, then what is Corrections doing?"  At this year's Prison Justice Day rally in  Vancouver on August 9th, about 100 people  gathered beneath the security cameras outside the Downtown Eastside Pre-trial Centre  to remember the three women who have died  in regional prisons over the past year, and to  protest the life conditions within the growing prison industry.  Joint Effort also circulated a petition addressed to the Commissioner for Federal  Corrections, Ole Ingstrup, calling for the  transfer of the women out of the men's prisons.  A spokesperson for the Solicitor General  (the ministry responsible for Corrections),  Jacques Belanger, says there will be an im  minent announcement concerning the  women in men's prisons and the women  still in Kingston's P4W. Although P4W  was slated to close last year, 13 women  successfully contested CSC's plans to  send them to men's prisons. With legal  intervention from CAEFS, the women  argued the move would have been illegal, and CSC dropped its plans.  Belanger says all the women will be  transferred to other maximum security facilities. He wouldn't say which ones, but  indicated that if the women are sent to  the new, medium security regional prisons, those prisons would be refortified,  and maximum security units would be  installed.  "The transfer of women to the men's  facilities was never meant to be a  long-term solution," says Belanger. "They  are there because these are high need  women and we have the infrastructure to  deal with them in the men's units." He  adds: "They are a threat to staff."  "That's what CSC wants everyone to  believe," says Pate, who has been told by  staff at the men's units that the women  don't belong there.  CAEFS is taking court action to argue that the method of determining security class is inherently sexist, racist,  classist and heterosexist. Security is de  cided by converting the number of "needs"  a person has into security "risks."  If, at the time a woman is sentenced,  she's unemployed, has no collateral, is depressed, has a history of abuse, neither active in her community nor a church-goer,  and if she uses drugs, there's a greater likelihood she'll be classed as a higher security risk.  CAEFS' stance is that the less a woman  fits the dominant society's profile of an  ideal citizen, and the less privileged she is,  the more punishment she'll likely get. For  example, Pate points out, First Nations  women in Canada make up less than two  percent of the general population, but 30  percent of the women's prison population.  The placement of the "maximum security" women in men's prisons flies in the  face of so-called "progressive" prison reforms presented by Louise Arbour in 1996,  following an independent commission of  inquiry into events at the Prison for Women  two years earlier. Arbour chaired the inquiry investigating the actions of an all-  male riot squad at P4W after their broadcast on national television sparked public  outrage [see Kinesis May 1996.]  P4W administration had called in the  riot squad to control eight women in 1994.  see PRISON page 17  Writing, reading and revolution  risoners words increase everybody's political literacy  by Frances Foran  Kris Lyons recalls an especially memorable search through a library known to carry  hard-to-find journals. She was looking for  Tightwire: the journal of the inside sisterhood.  Put together by the women at the Prison  for Women (P4W) in Kingston, Ontario between 1979 and 1992, it was a humble and  surprising piece of work—really just a few  photocopied sheets held by a staple. But  reading it, you can feel the producers' energy,  as if their art was a response to a state of  emergency.  In a sense, it was. Tightwire was full of  urgent calls for change in the way the state  and the media treat women in trouble with  the law. It railed against the general public's  two moods: apathy or fear of them. It documented their commitment to survive long  enough to change the system and to provide  each other with strength and support.  And they did all this under constant surveillance from within the notorious P4W, a  place which an independent inquiry, condemned as archaic four years after it opened  in 1934.  Disappointed, Lyons approached the librarian. "Where're the journals produced by  the women in prison?" she asked. "They have  nothing to say," the librarian responded. Lyons is breathless with disbelief when she tells  this story. She should be. She contributed to  Tightwire while at P4W in 1985. And she  knows that women inside have a lot to say.  Women who've been sentenced to serve  time know how dramatically words change our  . lives. Words can ostracize or include you;  words can make a record that follows you for  life. From reading Tightwire, it's clear that the  writers turned their own words and sentences  into tools of resistance.  One issue documents a woman's successful battle to have access to a Native Elder, braid  her hair and to keep a sacred eagle feather in  her cell after P4W staff vehemently denied her  these rights.  Far too many issues carry obituaries to  women who ended their lives there.  But as the women became more critical of  the prison, more confident that they had a right  to be heard and that the law was on their side  in their claims of abuse in the prison system,  prison staff stepped up their censorship.  "It was a joke," says Lyons. "They censored  it so much no one wanted to do it anymore."  The journal folded in 1992.  Now president of Strength in Sisterhood,  a group which offers peer support for women  in trouble with the law, Lyons is planning on  organizing another magazine as a forum for  women inside to "document the reality and get  it out to the public. The only way to change the  stigma is to get people talking."  Another way is for more people to read  works by women who've been through the  criminal justice system, such as Yvonne  Johnson's autobiography, Stolen Life:The Journey of a Cree Woman. Johnson, who was incarcerated in P4W from 1991 to 1994, started  a writing group for battered women and kept a  diary, which formed the nucleus of her autobiography.  Her Governor General's Award-nominated story could have a huge impact on  the fight to have her life sentence commuted, says Kim Pate, the executive director of the Canadian Association of Fry Societies.  Last year, Johnson and co-author Rudy  Weibe released Stolen Life from the  Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge in Maple  Creek, Saskatchewan, where she is now  held.  Johnson's story reveals how the legal  process of constructing the "truth" worked  against her even before she was declared  guilty. While the details of her life seem  unique, she writes that other women in P4W  understood her story "because it is so much  their own," as well.  Of four people involved in the death  of an alleged child molester in her small Alberta community, Johnson was the only one  who received a life sentence for first degree murder with no chance of parole for  25 years.  Stolen Life strongly suggests that the  fact she was a mother of four, whose lifelong abuse by family members was already  a matter of public record at the time of her  trial, made her the "most culpable" (that is,  guilty) of the four accused in the eyes of  the all-white jury.  Johnson lost her bid for review of her  sentence under the provisions of the battered women's defense last year, when the  court refused to include defending one's  children in the meaning of "self" defense.  "Her situation reeks of injustice," says  Pate. "But [Stolen Life] raised public awareness of her situation and there's been a huge  outcry. I don't know how her case will be reviewed, but it'll happen."  Prisoner rights activists in Vancouver are  continuing the tradition of facilitating women's writing from the inside. Through the advocacy group Joint Effort, Marni Norwich held  a writing workshop at the British Columbia  Correctional Centre for Women (BCCW) earlier this year.  One night a week for a month, a dozen  women generated topics to write about, chose  one at random, and shared their work. Norwich didn't "teach" anyone to write or tell them  what to write about. Rather, the workshop was  meant to bring out what already existed within  the women.  "People have different ways into their  hearts, and writing is one way," says Norwich.  "It's a way to know our true thoughts."  Joint Effort's work attempts to make a  bridge between women inside and outside to  help them make the transition and cut the  stigma of being imprisoned. "For so long people have used the system as a way of dealing with undesirables," says Phillis Iverson.  "People end up in prison because of problems in our communities, and we have to deal  with them in our communities. Locking them  up doesn't address issues of poverty and  drug abuse."  Norwich hopes to hold more workshops  with the women at BCCW. "I have great respect for their strength," she says.  SEPTEMBER 1999  SIS  11 HIV Education and  For peers  Ihy peers.   Counselling at BCCW:  a conversation between Quita,  Margreth, Sharon, Deanna and  Suzanne   As part of annual Prisoners Justice Day  events in early August, Stark Raven, a weekly  program on Vancouver's Cooperative Radio, set  up a conversation with four women involved  with the BC Correctional Centre for Women  (BCCW) Peer Education and Counselling  Project. The project is the only one of its kind  in Canada, specifically developed by and for  women in a correctional facility.  Quita works with the BC Persons With  AIDS Society's Prison Outreach Program. She  goes into BCCW every Monday night to speak  to women in both the secure and the open-living unit. Margreth does outreach work with  women through AIDS Vancouver. She has been  going to BCCW since early 1996 to work with  women who want to develop the project. And  Sharon and Deanna are both former members  of the BCCW HIV Peer Education and Counselling Project. Sharon is now a support worker  at the Positive Women's Network.  The conversation was facilitated by  Suzanne, with technical support from Amanda.  Stark Raven can be heard every Monday, from  7:00 to 7:30 pm, on Coop Radio, CRFO  102.7FM.  Suzanne: What prompted the start of  a peer HIV education program at BCCW?  Margreth: In late 1995, early 1996, there  were a group of  women who were  inmates at BCCW  who were really  concerned about  HTV in the prison.  Lots of women  coming in were testing positive. There  was no support, no  information. There  was also a lot of  stigma for women,  a lot of fear about  coming out HIV  positive for lots of  different reasons.  A group of inmates were talking  about that and, at  the same time, there  was a group of concerned staff who  were talking about  the same problems.  Eventually these  groups of inmates  and staff found  each other and said,  "OK, we've got to  do something about  this."  They called in a  number of community groups, including AIDS Vancouver, BC Persons  With AIDS, Positive  Women's Network,  and one of the street  nurses. We all sat  around a table in  February 1996 and  said, "What are we  going to do about  this?" And so a  group of inmates, staff and I founded the  Peer Education Program that day.  Suzanne: What were some of the  things happening inside in terms of women's safety?  Sharon: I think the big thing is the  stigma attached to being HTV+ or having  AIDS when you're in jail. A majority of  women just don't want to tell anybody that  they're positive for fear of isolation. There  was a time when [HTV-I-] inmates would  have been isolated from the rest of the population. That's not the case anymore, but  there's a type of isolation that goes beyond  that, and that's being ostracized by the rest  of the population. It's a very lonely place.  As a woman who's been positive for  10 years and who has done quite a bit of  time in jail, I know that I lived in fear for  years and just didn't tell anybody. What  ends up happening is that women who  don't talk about [their FflV+ status] are denying themselves the medical attention  they need, and emotional and spiritual support. These are the kinds of things we are  trying to overcome.  Suzanne: It's hard enough to get those  things on the outside, let alone on the inside.  Margreth: That's the other thing I want  to bring up when we talk about the problems on the inside. When women don't talk  about their health problems, they don't get  the support inside, and they also don't get  the connection to the outside community  agencies once they are released. So the isolation just goes on and on.  Suzanne: In terms of the peer education project, what did you actually do inside?  Deanne: Part of the program was that  I would facilitate HIV prevention classes  for inmates just coming in. It was based on  a harm reduction model. In the first week,  I would hold a workshop that would last  approximately an hour. It basically addressed sexual activity in the prison, as well  as safe needle use and transferring of contraband, and the risk of HTV. We'd usually  get a few questions at the end of the workshop, but I would notice that over the next  few days, I'd have women approaching me  with questions.  Part of the workshop would include  how to be tested inside confidentially.  There's no confidentiality inside the prison,  so it's quite hard. We would tell women  how they could go through the health nurse  at the prison and [their test result] would  be confidential.  I noticed that when women would first  come in and look at their health issues or  be detoxing, they'd look really concerned:  reality would set in. This was the first time  they'd find out if they had health issues.  I was a peer counsellor, but it was on a  more informal basis because there was  stigma if I was seen talking to people. They  would have fear that they would be known  to have HIV A lot of the time my counselling was done when I was approached at  work or in the hallway. I would then refer  [the woman] either to another counsellor  or an outside agency.  Suzanne: Maybe I can ask the rest of  you what you've done with women inside.  Sharon: I was trained to facilitate the  education program that they held on Saturday mornings and to do basic counselling. We had a couple of women from the  Battered Women's Support Services come  in and give us some intense training on how  to emotionally support the other women.  We posted who was on duty for that  day in each unit to let the other inmates  know who they could talk to. Very rarely  would somebody make an appointment to  see one of us. That concerned me. When I  first got to BCCW and was still going  through detoxing, I had to go to this HTV  seminar. I thought, "Wow, what a relief,  somebody is finally talking about this;  something is finally  happening." I saw   this as a really positive thing.  Right after the  seminar, I approached a couple of  women who put it  on that day. I let  them know who I  was and what I was  about, and how  [HIV] had affected  me over the years. I  told them if there  was anything I  could do to help to  please let me know.  I was approached  shortly after that.  They had a vision. [It was wonderful] that staff was  working with the  women.   I   don't  think at the time there was anyone on the  team who was positive. I thought it would  be a very good idea if they had somebody  who was positive and could relate to [other  positive women] on an emotional level. I  offered my services.  It was about time that this kind of thing  was happening. I took a stand. I knew what  it was like to live in fear, in isolation, and I  just didn't want to live like that anymore.  And I didn't want any of the other women  to have to live like that anymore.  Actually, I wore a t-shirt for a while that  said, "Living Positive." I thought that if I  could speak out, more women would feel  more comfortable. When I first went to  BCCW, I was told that about 35 percent of  the population was infected with HIV, but  only two women came to talk to me. We  still had a long way to go.  Suzanne: What about outside agencies  coming in? Margrethe and Quita, maybe  you can explain your roles in the project?  Quita:I was at the meeting in late 1995  that led to the February 1996 meeting. I  started coming in with my team to provide  support and information referral. We originally started going in to the secure side of  BCCW. We met women in the rotunda, and  we talked with anybody who wanted to  come forward and discuss anything to do  with HIV/AIDS—whether they were HrV+  or they knew somebody who was, or were  just interested in asking questions. We  brought in an outside support counselling  system.  That wasn't quite as successful as we  hoped it might have been. We were on hiatus for a while, but then started up again  with what we do currently. Three of us go  out to BCCW every Monday, and we walk  "Women on the outside,  in the Main and Hastings  area, who were going back  and forth in and out of  BCCW, were telling other  women on the outside  about the peer education  project inside. They were  already making their  own connections."  - Margreth -  around on four of the units in the secure  side. We visit with inmates there, whether  they are FHV+ or not, just anybody who  might be interested in talking. We also go  to the open-living unit twice a month.  What we are  _ finding    is    that  women are not coming forward. We are  getting a few  women coming forward in the four  units we go to. I  think they are starting to recognize us,  and we seem reasonably comfortable, so maybe they  can talk a little bit.  But 35 percent of inmates are definitely  not coming near us.  It's the fear and  panic, even if we  identify ourselves.  We say we're from  POP, and somebody  says, "So what's  that?" [The Prison  Outreach Program]  is an off-shoot of the BC Persons With AIDS  Society. And there's that word. As soon as  the word "AIDS" comes out, then women  say, "Well no, I'm not one of those." And  then we have to explain that we're talking  to anybody; we're not singling anybody out  and we're open to any questions. But that  fear is very real.  Margreth: I started the education  training in February 1996.1 took a copy of  the workshop I do in recovery houses to a  group of inmates at BCCW and said,  "Here's a standard HIV orientation workshop. What works and what doesn't work  here?"  The women, both inmates and staff,  were part of a team which wrote the first  workshop from that script. When we talk  about harm reduction, that's when they  bring in detailed information on how to  clean a "rig" [injection drug needle] inside.  Asking someone to leave a needle in bleach  for 30 seconds, three times, to clean a rig is  very difficult when you have guards coming in and checking your room.  We were trying to give them information on how to do that in a timely fashion  and what to do when there was no bleach,  or how to get bleach when the only bleach  on the unit was with the staff and it wasn't  safe to ask staff for the bleach because then  you're identified as a potential drug user.  The women doing the education gave  detailed information on how to effectively  do rig cleaning while they were there [at  BCCW,] and how to engage in sexual activity with each other—same-sex activity is  illegal in the institution and here we were  giving information to women on how to  reduce risk of passing HIV and other STDs.  The other piece was passing contraband  and how to do that without passing HTV.  [Passing contraband] is against the law as  well, and here we were teaching all of that.  There were all kinds of taboos being  broken, not just talking about HIV And staff  were involved from the beginning. Staff  were trying to educate their co-workers as  well, to lower the stigma [HIV+ women  face] among staff.  There was a really good momentum  building until early 1998. Then, for a variety of reasons—different dynamics going  through the prison—the program sort of  took a bit of a break.  But the stigma was really breaking  down in many ways up until that time because there were so many elements in the  prison all working together to break the silence and the denial about this health problem. It was the unity and the solidarity of  the different elements that was making it  safer in general.  As the education has stopped happening, the stigma has risen again. That is what  we are encountering. It is becoming unsafe  again to talk about HIV, to talk about health  problems, and [for inmates] to get tested  for HIV  DeannaWe had people mentioning to  us that they had just been told they had HIV  standing in the meds line-up [where inmates go to get their medication.] The lineup can be up to 30 people long; there was  no empathy shown, and the person was just  devastated. They were briefly told that their  test came back for HIV, and that was it. It's  a huge shock.  Sharon:And how cold to get told that,  and then to be left there having to walk past  those 30 women standing in the line-up.  Where is the sensitivity?  Margreth:And without the education,  the belief comes back to people that they  can get [HTV] from  saliva or sharing a  cigarette, from sitting next to a positive woman, or if an  HIV+ women is  working in the  kitchen. Those old  myths grow in people's fears.  Deanna: And  that's what the  workshops were  about, to get across  exactly how HIV is  Sharon: The  first time I was admitted into BCCW  and went through  A&D (admitting  and discharge), a  guard handed me a  package and went through his blurb. "Staff  here do not condone the use of these items;  however, if you are going to participate in  these kind of activities, we want you to do  it safely."  "With HIV, it is highly  important to have proper  nutrition. Both the drugs and  the disease hamper  metabolism. People who  are HIV+ require more  food pure and simple,  but it isn't provided..."  - Quita -  In this package was a bottle of bleach,  a condom and a package of lubrication. I  went, "Wow, things are really changing.  That was the beginning. This was something a staff member was handing me, and  this was something I could use. For me, that  marked the fact that things were changing  inside.  Suzanne: Why was the education  project effective?  Sharon:I think it's because we were  getting practical information out there and  creating safety for the general population  [at BCCW] Even being positive for as long  as I was, I learned some things in that education program that I didn't know.  Margrethlt was practical information,  but it was also given by peers. It was important that it was an inmate giving the information, not a guard or a community  agency person, but another woman who  was living [in the prison.]  DeannaJ found it made a big difference that I was a peer giving this information. I'd start off a workshop with, "Hi, I'm  Deanna and I'm an inmate here." The workshops were mandatory and so a lot of  women would come in hostile. But once  they found out that I was an "us"—because  there is an "us" and a "them"—it made all  the difference in the world.  Women were way more cooperative.  You have to remember too that when  women are first hearing this stuff, it is a  time when they are not feeling the best;  they're not feeling good at all, they're sick.  As well, if somebody was HIV-I-, we  could help her to get proper nutrition or  medication, or to speed the process up.  Again, the person is sick; she doesn't have  the energy to fight for anything or even ask  for anything.  As an inmate, I had way more trust  from the other  women, especially  when it came to  counselling. There's  such low confidentiality in the prison—  for somebody to talk  to you about anything, it's pretty  much taboo. I feel  that being an inmate  really opened up a  lot of trust among  the women.  Suzanne: Before this project, had  anything been tried  before? Had guards  given out pamphlets  or anything?  Margreth: Not  to my knowledge.  What makes [the  peer education project] effective was the  practical nature or the information.

Feature  A recipe for spicy (women) scientists:  Is it really what we want?  by Agnes Huang  "So, tell me what you want, what you  really, really want..."  That's what women science teachers  should be singing in class if they want to  encourage girls and young women to follow in their footsteps. Or, at least, that's  what some "prominent" women scientists  in England think.  Last April, at the Institute of Physics  annual congress in London, Averil  Macdonald, an educational consultant and  part-time physicist, told participants  (mostly male, no doubt) that girls are put  off by science and engineering because of  the "terrible problem with the stereotypical image of the scientist"—that is, bo-ring.  So what's the "proper" image? Well, it  must exude suc-cess.  What does that  mean? A flashy car for  starters (Macdonald has  two of them). And definitely some style-y outfits (Gotta be sensitive to  today's fashion trends,  because that's what  young girls are looking  for in a science teacher.)  Apparently, the director of London's Royal  Institution Susan  Greenfield, who's a neu-  roscientist, agrees with  Macdonald. There  should be "more physics teachers looking like  the Spice Girls," exclaims Greenfield. (Do  you think she's also talking about the male  teachers?)  All right, all right.  Enough, enough. In case  you think we made all  this up... rest assured,  we got this info from a  reliable source: The Province. (Well, actually, they  got it from The Daily Telegraph.)  So, what would it take to get more girls  and young women interested in pursuing  studies and careers in the science fields.  One thing, maybe... would be knowing that  they'd be joining a long line of women  physicists, doctors, botanists, astronomers,  microbiologists, engineers, prosectors  (what's that?) and on and on.  How many well-known (or at least  fairly well-known) women scientists can  you think of? Usually, the one (and often,  only one) that pops into people's heads is:  Marie Curie, a physicist/chemist from  France. She, and her husband Pierre Curie,  discovered two new elements: polonium  and radium. But it was Marie who continued with her groundbreaking research to  learn about the nature of radioactivity.  An interesting note about Madame  Curie: she was not French. Rather, she was  born in Poland in 1867, and until she married Pierre, was known as Maria  Sklowdoska.  Okay, try this one. Remember E=MC2?  Question: who came up with this? Albert  Einstein? Sure, that's what the textbooks  say. Well, it might actually have been Mrs.  Atomic Spice. It seems that before she and  Einstein got married, Mileva Marie was at  the University of Heidelberg in Germany  already working on a theory of relativity.  After they divorced, Einstein announced  his conclusion that: "Energy equals mass  times (velocity) squared."  (We do admit there is disagreement  about the role Marie played in the revelation, but we still must wonder how much  credit for E=MC2 should have been be accorded to Marie, and not Einstein.)  Who else? Well, below, are just a few  of the many vomen who have contributed  significantly in their respective fields of sci-  Mitchell continued teaching for 20  more years, and throughout her life, she  spoke out strongly and passionately about  the position of women. In 1874, she took  on the presidency of the Association for the  Advancement of Women.  Then there's Kamal Ranadive, a "pioneering" and pre-eminent cancer researcher  in India. Among her many accomplishments, she introduced tissue culture technology in India and developed a new discipline of growing animal cells in vitro.  Much of Ranadive's research work focused on issues affecting women. Her dissertation for her PhD in microbiology, received from the University of Bombay, was  on "Experimental Studies in Breast Cancer."  **jrAfe  ence and to broader society. (And don't forget to check Merrilee Hughes' article on  page 16 for more scientific women who've  been shafted in history.)  Let's start off with Maria Mitchell, an  American astronomer, who in 1847 was the  first person to discover a comet through a  telescope. Although her achievements were  acknowledged and she was bestowed  many honours, including a gold medal presented by the King of Denmark, she had a  difficult time when it came to the realm of  academia.  In 1865 when Vassar College opened  in Poughkeepsie, New York, Mitchell was  invited to join the faculty. Her teaching style  was innovative: she refused to assign  grades to students because she felt "you  couldn't judge a human mind in terms of a  letter grade." Things changed at Vassar  three years later, though, when the college's  founder, Matthew Vassar, died, "...women  faculty were disciminated against—left off  committees, given less pay, and not allowed  to lecture off campus."  That was in 1949. Throughout her life, she  always made it a point to document her  work, producing over 200 publications,  mostly related to cancer and leprosy research.  The year 1952 was a very busy time for  Ranadive: she co-founded with VR.  Khanolkar the Indian Cancer Research Institute, and also initiated the Experimental  Biology Laboratory and Tissue Culture  Laboratory, all located in Bombay. For her  more than 30 years of researching and writing, Ranadive received "Padmabhushan,"  the highest honour awarded by the Indian  government.  Most certainly, Kamal Ranadive served  as a role model: "She broke the barriers of  time and inspired Indian women scientists  to enter the research field, especially cancer research related to women and children."  Ever hear of Marie-Louise  Lachappelle? Well, if your own birth was  attended by a midwife, or if you gave birth  with the help of a midwife, or if you ever  wished your birth or birthing involved a  midwife, then Lachappelle is someone who  has affected your life.  Born in 1769, Lachappelle came from  a long line of midwives. Her mother, Marie  Jonet Duges, oversaw the maternity ward,  as midwife-in-chief, at the Hotel Dieu in  Paris, a charitable institution founded to  serve poor people. (The hospital was the  first school for midwives set up in the second half of the 16th Century.) When her  mother died in 1795, Lachappelle succeeded her as head of Hotel Dieu's maternity ward.  Two years later, Lachappelle was invited by Jean-Louis Baudelocque, the foremost obstetrician in France at the time, to  help start up a new ma-  £0. ternity department at  ''Ct Port Royal de Paris, a  former religious institution. Named Hospice  de la Maternite (and  later, Maison  d'Accouchements), it  was envisioned as "a  systematically organized school that would  combine practical and  theoretical instruction  for midwives, who in  turn would train mid-  wives in the provinces."  Her approach to  midwifery showed she  kept women's best interests and well-being  e   in mind, "...she was op-  ^2  posed to unnecessary  ^  and potentially danger-  K   ous interventions by an  JS   attending doctor or  ,2   midwife. She insisted  >■. that instruments such  ■a   as forceps be used as lit-  a   tie as possible and  b  never just to shorten  Wssmmmm^-      labor." According to her  statistics, Lachappelle  only used forceps 93  times and performed just one Caesarian  section.  Like Kamal Ranadive, Lachappelle  was a meticulous record keeper. She made  notes of all the difficult deliveries she attended—collecting 40,000 case histories—  and drew from them to compile her book,  Pratique des Accouchements; ou Memoires et  Observations Choisies, sur les Points les Plus  Important de I'Art. Sadly, she died after completing only her first volume. (Her nephew,  Antoine Duges, a professor of medicine,  carried on Lachappelle's project, editing her  notes and publishing them in three volumes  in 1925.)  Let's not forget Alessandra Giliani.  She was born in 1307 in Italy, and was the  "first" woman prosector recorded by historians. (A prosector prepares dissections  for anatomical demonstration.) She developed a method of "draining blood from the  veins and arteries of a corpse and replacing it with coloured liquids that quickly  see SCIENCE next page  SEPTEMBER 1999  SIS Feature  The mis-recording of women in science:  Where credit is due  by Merrilee Hughes  Science is essentially about knowledge,  and "knowledge is power." That "knowledge/power" has historically been bestowed on men. But what is the truth?  Over the centuries, women have had  to fight for their education, employment  and recognition to varying degrees, in all  of the many fields of science. Education and  employment inequities are easily identifiable. The struggle women have faced in  gaining entrance to educational institutions,  both at the student and the faculty level, is  blatant and appalling.  Trying to find all the women in science  who have not received the recognition they  deserve is difficult, given the various reasons behind the "oversights"—some of  which were quite deliberate.  Among the reasons women scientists  have been "forgotten" are: Praise for the  accomplishments of women scientists married to other scientists is frequently bestowed on their husbands. Advances made  through collaborations have regularly been  credited to only the male participants. And  sometimes, their discoveries have been stolen outright.  Recognition is not simply about getting  awards and being mentioned in textbooks  for years to come. Without recognition,  women are not remembered. And acknowledging the achievements of women scientists today is just as crucial as remembering those of a 100 years ago. It's not just  about remembering history, but about recording history.  Women who are not remembered are  not valued. Modern feminist concerns in  science range from gaining faculty appointments to generating research funding. These  are all dependent on the value placed on  the individual and her work. Hence, ongoing recognition of women's accomplishments is essential.  Here are just a few of the women in the  history of science whose work and accomplishments have never fully been recognized in the still male-dominated realm of  science.  Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1878-1972)  With a Ph.D in psychology, Moller  Gilbreth and her husband, who did not hold  any degrees, owned a consulting firm and  had 12 children. She significantly contributed in the field of engineering time-and-  motion studies, integrating relevant psychological components to increase industrial efficacy and production. Moller  Gilbreth continued to manage the firm, received honorary Master's degrees and  Ph.Ds in engineering, and accepted faculty  positions at engineering schools, and outlived her husband by 48 years. In spite of  her obvious individual accomplishments,  Lillian Moller Gilbreth is regularly referred  to as her husband's assistant.  Rosalind Franklin  (1920-1958)  Rosalind Franklin  was hired on at Kings College in London, England because Maurice Wilkins lacked the expertise  to carry out the x-ray crystallography work  needed to illuminate the structure of DNA.  Franklin accepted the position believing  herself to be a colleague working autonomously on the project. She was able to take  x-ray diffraction photographs demonstrating the structure of DNA was a helix—this  fact had eluded other investigators working on the same problem. Not only did  Wilkins pass along her unpublished papers  to James D. Watson and Francis Crick, who  were researching the structure of DNA at  Cambridge University, he also showed  Watson Franklin's pictures without her  knowledge. This key piece of information  allowed Watson to correct the errors in their  model of DNA. In 1962, Crick and Watson  were awarded the Nobel Prize with  Wilkins. Franklin, who had been dead for  four years, was not able to contest the injustice.  Emmy Noether (1882-1935)  As a mathematician in Germany,  Emmy Noether developed a theorem which  is still relevant in modern elementary particle physics. Noether's theorem is particularly useful in the application of the theory  of quantum mechanical fields, but what  most people who are using it do not realize is that Noether was a woman.  Lise    Meitner  (1878-1968)  Lise Meitner  and Otto Hahn  had a long history  of working together in the  study of radioactivity. They discovered thorium C and protactinium—radioactive  compounds—Meitner also published  works characterizing the nature of alpha,  beta and gamma radiation. In 1944, Hahn  received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for  identifying the presence of barium from the  slow neutron bombardment of uranium reported in 1939. Both Hahn and Meitner  began the work together, but Meitner's  work was cut short as she was forced to  leave Austria to avoid the Nazi regime. As  it is obvious from writings that she had  performed much of the work herself and  suggested that uranium was breaking  down into barium and krypton components, it is uncertain why she was not included in the award.  Bertha Lamme (1869-1954)  Bertha Lamme was the second woman  in the United States to receive an engineering degree. She worked at Westinghouse  Electric and Manufacturing Company for  12 years, designing motors and generators.  Her career was cut short by her marriage  to her supervisor. Her husband and bachelor brother, who also lived with her, both  went on to make major contributions in the  field of electrical power. Her own involvement in their success is difficult to ascertain. Her husband's designs were  showcased at the St. Louis World's Fair, and  he was later instrumental in the design of  the turbogenerators at Niagra Falls. The  couple's daughter went on to become a  physicist. We are left to wonder the true  extent of Lamme's contributions in her  family's scientific pursuits.  Jocelyn Bell  As a graduate student working at  Cambridge University under the supervision of Antony Hewish, Jocelyn Bell devoted months to mapping the sky for  radiowave sources. This tedious work involved distinguishing between signals gen  erated by humans and those emanating  from stars. Of the 400 feet of charts generated from a single four-day scan of the sky,  Bell noticed an odd signal taking up about  half of an inch of that chart. More importantly, she remembered seeing the unique  signal pattern in past charts. This prompted  Bell to search for other unusual signals  which she found two months later. These  two initial findings were significant enough  to warrant publishing an article on the discovery of pulsars in the journal Nature, recognized for its preference for novel developments. In 1974 though, it was Hewish  who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his prominent role in the discovery  of pulsars. Bell got no mention.  These are just a few of the women who  made contributions to science but were  "shafted" by the boys and by history. There  are several good books that do pay tribute  to women in the many fields of science.  Check them out... if you can find them in  your public library or at local bookstores.

With this technique, she could  highlight any portion of the circulatory system, and was able to mark the most minute  blood vessels.  Interestingly, her work bolstered the  reputation and renown of her father,  Mondino dei Luzze, the "father" of modern anatomy. Alessandra Giliani died at age  19. Who knows how much more she would  have achieved had she not died so young.  So, here's a question: Who was one of  the "first" woman doctor in Korea and co-  founder of the "first" medical school in  Korea devoted to training women doctors?  The answer: Chung-Hee Kil.  Kil was born in Seoul in 1899. When  she was 19, there was no medical school in  Korea that would train women, so off she  went to Japan to study at the Tokyo Wom  en's Medical College. After graduating, she  returned to Seoul and joined the Dong-Dae-  Moon Women's Hospital.  Realizing that only a medical school  devoted to training women would address  the lack of women doctors in Korea,  Chung-Hee Kil, her husband Tak-Won Kim,  also a physician, and Rosetta Hall, a missionary physician from New York, started  the Chosen Women's Medical Training Institute in 1928. (The institute later became  a college, the Seoul Women's Medical College, and is now the Korea University College of Medicine.)  Despite years of medical training and  practice, Kil could not evade sexist stereotyping. "She recalled that her patients and  colleagues referred to her as a 'nurse' or  'midwife,' until she successfully performed  an operation that her male colleagues had  refused to perform."  Always active in promoting and supporting the education and work of women,  Kil served as the president of the Korean  Women's Medical Association, and as an  instructor at the Ewha Women's University.  Information for our profiles of the women  scientists noted above was drawn from: Generations of Denial: 75 Short Biographies of  Women in History written by Kathryn Taylor  (Times Change Press, New York, 1971) for the  information on Maria Mitchell; and Notable  Women in the Life Sciences, edited by  Benjamin F Shearer and Barbara S. Shearer  (Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut,  1996) for the information on Kamal Ranadive,  Marie-Louise Lachappelle, Chung-Hee Kil and  Alessandra Giliani.  As a side (or really, centre) note, we would  have included more profiles of "prominent"  women scientists if it were not for the "limitations" of libraries. Kelly Haydon made the trek  down to the Vancouver Public Library Central Branch in search for books on women in  science, only to discover that the only copy of  Notable Women in the VPL system is a reference book, which means it cannot be taken out  and shown around. (Thanks Kelly for photocopying.)  Agnes Huang never took a science class after  Grade 12, even though science is what stereotypical Chinese girls are supposed to be good  at. She would have been thoroughly amused if  her high school science teachers had shown up  dressed like the Spice Girls, especially since they  were all male and Catholic.  16  KMWpl  IS  SEPTEMBER 1999 Feature  from PRISON page 11  In full riot gear and armed with mace and  clubs, the Emergency Response Team  stripped and body-searched the women  and threw them naked and in leg irons into  segregation, where some remained for nine  months.  With input from researchers, community groups and the prisoners themselves,  Arbour found that the prison administration had flouted the women's basic human  rights and failed to properly report their  own actions. She also concluded that the  actions of the riot squad were "cruel, inhumane and degrading," and that the eight  women deserved compensation.  Other findings of the inquiry were that  federally sentenced women—those serving  two years or more—are routinely sent into  prison with conditions much more punitive than their sentences warrant, since the  only destination for such women had been  the maximum security P4W.  The Report attested that the majority  of women prisoners were neither violent  nor threats to security. On the contrary, the  "medieval fortress"-like conditions of P4W,  its dearth of useful activities and programs  and the prison's use of segregation as punishment for bad behaviour, contributed to  incidents of suicide and self-injury—a  chronic problem at P4W.  To redress the "neglect, barbarism and  paternalism" that characterizes traditional  women's corrections, Arbour directed Corrections to transfer the women at P4W to  the new regional  To redress the "neglect,  barbarism and paternalism"  that characterizes traditional  women's corrections, Arbour  directed Corrections to transfer the women at P4W to the  new regional prisons, and  drew a list of recommendations meant to create a parallel and "innovative" correctional system for women.  prisons, and drew a  list of recommendations meant to create  a parallel and "innovative" correctional  system for women.  The Report's 14  recommendations  were ambitious.  They recognized  that the whole machinery needed to  be re-worked, from  the police up to the  office of the Corrections Commissioner.  To achieve this, the  recommendations  proposed that police  and judges be educated in the realities  of women's lives, in  order for them to  understand   that     , ,,"", """,", , ,   most women who  end up behind bars have histories of abuse,  and that the authoritarian structure of  prison is especially destructive to women's  survival inside.  Far from more punishment, Arbour  said the women need "healing," training  in useful skills to let them lead  self-determined lives, and contact with  outside resources in their communities  while they are imprisoned.  Arbour proposed the appointment of  a Women's Corrections Commissioner who  would make "holistic and progressive correctional techniques" a priority. These included increased family and community  contacts and useful vocational training,  other than the usual prison beauty-school.  For First Nations women, the Arbour  Report recommended the option of serving time at the minimum security Okimaw  Ohci Healing Lodge in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan, regardless of their risk classification.  The Arbour Report was just the latest  piece of commentary promising to change  the way the justice system deals with  women. Like previous government reports  on the corrections system, Arbour reiterated  the need to shut down P4W. Federal investigators, the Supreme Court of Canada, the  Canadian Bar Association, and even Corrections itself, had repeatedly recommended and promised the closure of P4W  since 1938.  In fact, it was Corrections' own 1990  Task Force on Federally Sentenced Women  that generated the concept of "holistic"  and "women-centred" corrections. For the  first time, women in P4W were included  in the discussion of what they needed and  how the criminal justice system had failed  them.  One woman at P4W asked the Task  Force, "Why do you still only accept the  words of [prison staff]? Why have I witnessed over a hundred slashings, wiped up  pints of blood from floors and walls, and  carried blood-soaked mattresses outside to  the garbage? Why?"  The Task Force's report recognized traditional correctional strategies were in  "fundamental conflict" with the needs of  women, and promised not to "fail federally sentenced women again."  Litigation hasn't ensured changes to  the correctional system, either. Over the  years, prisoners and their advocates have  tried to transform the criminal justice sy tern  with legal strategies to demonstrate that the  corrections system discriminates against  women. They've had  varying success.  In 1981, the federal Human Rights  Commission found  P4W discriminatory  in the provision of  goods, services and  facilities. In 1992, the  Supreme Court of  Canada agreed that  Corrections Canada's facilities for  women are discrimi-  natory, and ruled  that Gayle Horii, a  Native woman from  British Columbia  could serve her life  sentence closer to  home instead of in  P4W.  And recognizing the connection  between the living  conditions at P4W  and its suicide rate, at least one judge has  considered P4W cruel and inhuman punishment. In 1990, Judge Marion Wedge tried  to prevent sentencing Carol Daniels, a Native woman from Saskatchewan, to serve  time there, and asked her to be sent to a  regional prison, instead.  Wedge found that "imprisonment in a  far away 'medieval castle-like prison'  where there is a risk of death by suicide is  unacceptable in a free and democratic society, and violates the right to life and security of the person... such a location far  distant from home, family and friends  amounts to virtual exile and is cruel and  unusual punishment."  Wedge's decision was overturned on  appeal from the Attorney General of  Canada, on the grounds that where to send  Daniels was Corrections Canada's business,  not judges'.  None of these attempts at legal remedies nor government reports achieved the  goal of shutting down the federal prison  for women. They did underline the pressing need for Corrections to change the system and do away with its demonstrably lethal practices or else face more litigation  from women.  The new regional prisons—spread between Burnaby, BC and Truro, Nova  Scotia—were supposed to mark a new philosophy of "holistic" corrections, geared  more to-  prove  their lives  than pun-  i s h i n g  them.  Initially conceived as places that resembled townhouses with an open-living  feel, Corrections returned in the mid-90's  and refortified them, adding high walls,  sensor wire and night vision cameras. And  now possibly, the facilities will be refortified  again to accommodate the women  incaracerated in the men's prisons and the  13 still inside P4W.  So what happened to Corrections' "holistic" paradigm? The paradox of a "healing" prison system doesn't escape Karlene  Faith, a criminolgy professor at Simon  Fraser University and author of Unruly  Women: the politics of confinement and resistance.  "There's a huge contradiction between  the design of the new prisons and their  practice," says Faith. Trying to graft a "holistic" paradigm onto a punitive philosophy is futile, she adds. The expansion of  the correctional system in order to correct  its past mistakes has only entrenched punishment as the easiest and obvious response  to the social conditions which lead women  into committing crimes.  For Faith, the attempt to put a residential look on a prison is not progress: a prison  is still a prison, even if its aesthetics allow  those who don't live there to ignore it.  Moreover, cosmetic changes in design and  attempts to reform prisons obscure the social realities which lead to imprisonment—  primarily, poverty, and the methods women  use to survive outside.  "The holistic paradigm is farcical because the old retributive philosophy persists," says Faith. "Prisons are retributive  justice that rob communities of their power  to change. Every prison instills fear in the  local community by its very presence."  What's more, since the inception of the  new prisons, the number of women serving time has doubled, says Joint Effort's  Iverson, even though crime rates have been  steadily dropping.  The regressive developments since  Louie Arbour issued her report raise questions as to whether Corrections can correct  itself, or optimally, make itself obsolete.  "It can't," says Kris Lyons, a former  prisoner of P4W and member of Strength  in Sisterhood, a peer group for women inside. "It's a closeted ministry and totally  unaccountable to anyone outside itself."  Moreover, the inherently punitive  structure of life behind bars perpetuates itself by teaching powerlessness and despondency, says Lyons. The talk of 'woman-  centred' and 'holistic' corrections in a  prison was always a whitewash, she says.  "The system sets you up to fail. They  make you take a course and the outside  world just isn't like that. They don't correct anything," says Lyons. "People have  no idea what it's like, having to fight for  every little thing. It's not a learning/healing environment."  The one manifestation of a forward  shift in correctional practices is the Okimaw  Ohci Healing Lodge—the only regional  prison Corrections didn't refortify. Like the  other regional prisons, it was designed as  a minimum security prison, but one especially for First Nations women.  Women  at the Healing Lodge  can engage  in spiritual  ceremonies  and have  constant access to  Elders,  something  women at P4W weren't permitted until  just 10 years ago. Author and prisoner  Yvonne Johnson describes the Lodge as "an  architectural marvel" in her autobiography,  Stolen Life. She explains why no reinforcements are needed to keep the women inside:  "Once the site for the Healing Lodge  was chosen, the Elders tied four ceremonial flags to the trees on the limits of the  land at the four directions, to let the Creator and Spirit World acknowledge the  place. So the spiritual boundaries were set,  and now no bars or fencing is needed here  because if you cross the boundaries of the  four colours you defy the Creator and the  Spirits, the ultimate disrespect, and who  would do that?"  The Healing Lodge has the lowest recidivism rate of all the prisons—meaning  that the women who are released from there  are the least likely to bo sent back for repeat offenses.  Despite Arbour's recommendation,  none of the First Nations women currently  held in segregation in men's prisons—who  make up half of the total number of women  still in men's prisons—is permitted to transfer to the Healing Lodge due to its minimum security.  Arguably, the "success" of the Healing  Lodge is due to a greater degree of autonomy, self-determination and freedom  from "normal" correctional practices the  women experience there. Critics agree that  if Corrections were truly committed to helping people stay out of the system, they  would see from the example of the Healing Lodge that increasing the autonomy of  the women in their custody keeps them out  of jail in the future.  If they believed their own language,  says Faith, Corrections would get out of the  prison business, and divert some of their  $2 billion budget to community groups  which envision alternatives to incarceration, provide early intervention and more  halfway houses than the mere one that exists west of Toronto.  Lyons and others agree that since decades of litigation, research and reports like  Arbour's have been so ineffective at changing the prison system, it's time to let change  come from the women who have been  through it.  For her part, Lyons envisions a  peer-run transition house where women  coming out of prison can stay among others they trust, stay clean, and get the resources they need to get on with their lives.  "They don't need professional counselling," Lyons says. "They need someone  to put their arm around them and say, "Hey,  you've got something to live for."  Frances Foran is a Vancouver writer.  SEPTEMBER 1999 Arts  Arts  Previews of Vancouver's Fringe Festival:  Women's talent  by Gabriele Kohlmeyer  Although the situation has somewhat  improved in the past years, women-centred  plays are still the exception to the rule in  the male domain of mainstream theatre.  Luckily, institutions such as the Fringe  Festivals do give women artists on a budget  some chance to get their creative visions  onstage for a relatively small amount of  money. Sadly though, with the closure of  the Women in View festival last year (after  10 years), there are now fewer opportunities for women artists—especially newer  ones—to workshop and stage their productions, and to develop their talents.  If you do make it to this year's Vancouver Fringe, coming up September 9th  to 19th, you'll get to see a number of promising women-centred shows.  I had the chance to talk to a few very  interesting women behind some of the innovative productions. Besides the ones I  connected up with mentioned below, there  are other equally interesting ones, such as  Trish Kelly's The Make Out Club, It's About  Time, a mystic comedy by Denise Wilson,  and new productions from The Weird Sisters from England, and Vancouver's own  RandomActs.  Check out the details about other productions and venues in the Fringe Guide,  available only at Starbucks (yikes). Or to get  an idea about some of these and other plays  coming to the Fringe, try and catch one of  the Sneak Previews playing September 1st  to 4th at 8:00pm at the Cavern Theatre, 1163  Commercial Drive. For details and tickets,  call the Fringe box office at (604) 257 0366.  For now, here's a a taste of what's to  come.  Fifty Seven and Still Lying about My Age  written and performed by Susan Freedman  directed by Jan Kudelka  Susan Freedman's Fifty Seven and Still  Lying About My Weight is a show that intends to make us laugh. Indeed, Freedman  says, laughter is her message. It is a show  about surviving Winnipeg winters, several  marriages, hairdos and diets, and long-distance running.  After having worked as the marketing  director at the Vancouver Fringe for four  years and having acted on and off during  her life, Freedman decided it was about  time to launch her own project.  Over the years, she says, she has seen  numerous reflections on the lives of the  twenty-something generation at the Fringe.  So on January 1st, 1999, she started creating her own play about the issues of the  under-represented fifty-something generation.  Fifty-Seven and Still Lying About My  Weight is based on Freedman's own life,  loves and influences. The final product, she  says, is a forty- five minute optimistic view  of her past and present.  "It might be my metabolism that makes  me able to look back at life in a positive  way," says Freedman. In any case, she considers herself lucky for having that gift to  remember the highlights of living, and is  very thankful for her ability to move on.  Does she consider herself a feminist?  "Absolutely," she answers. Nonetheless, she  does not believe in hanging on to anger.  "Luckily times do change," she says, and  hanging on to anger takes way too much  energy.  In her play, Freedman looks at the ups  and downs of life with laughing eyes, and  hopes the audience can recognize themselves in her.  Fifty Seven And Still Lying About My  Age will be performed at the Havana on Sep  11,7:45pm; Sep 13,4:45pm; Sep 15,9:30pm;  Sep 17,11:00pm; and Sep 18,2:00pm.  Hot Flashes: On the Rocky Road to  Redemption  a Broad Minds Production  written by Kim Seary  directed by Pam Johnson  performed by Christine Willes and Jessica  van der Veen  Meeting the women behind Hot Flashes,  I got to witness their juggling act, which  seems impossible to a free-as-a-bird, single  female like me. Kim Seary and Christine  Willes manage to function as high-quality  artists and mothers at the same time.  I met them together with Jessica van der  Veen, the actress playing Seary's part in this  production, and Willes' children Chloe and  Tom at the Hotel Vancouver restaurant bar  (children and smoking permitted).  Among lattes, soft drinks and children's drawings, we discussed Hot Flashes:  On the Rocky Road to Redemption. The play  is based on Seary's highly emotional, theatrical and personal relationship with  Willes.  "The story of the play is really in the  play," says Seary. While collecting material  and doing interviews for a completely different project, friends and colleagues kept  telling Seary and Willes how the truly riv  eting part of the research lay in their relationship and the story of their friendship.  That's how the idea for Hot Flashes was  born.  During the course of three years, the  play gradually evolved. After two productions and a number of workshops, the  characters in the play have slowly detached themselves from the real life Kim  and Chris, Willes says.  However, the material is so personal,  they had more than a strenuous time staging it. How do you find a third party to  direct a piece which is your very own flesh  and blood story?  In the first production, Willes and  Seary hired and fired four directors and  ended up directing it themselves. One can  imagine the power it takes to get up  onstage to relive your own crisis over and  over again.  The process of creating Hot Flashes  seems to have been a battle against all odds  even up to the day of our interview—  Willes was unable to find a babysitter for  her children.  The story of their friendship is also the  story of issues such as divorce, bi-polar  mood disorder and sexual abuse.  Have they ever considered simply letting go of the play? They vehemently shake  their heads. "That would be like giving up  your child," Seary says. Willes adds, "it almost seems like all these obstacles keep  coming in our way to test how much we  can take."  Kim and Chris are characters as opposite as can be. "As people," Seary says,  "Christine and I almost polar opposites.  Chris looks at life from the big picture, approaching things from the outside in,  whereas I start with the personal and work  towards the bigger scheme."  Their different views towards the  feminist quality of their play makes that  clear: Willes considers herself a feminist  and Hot Flashes a feminist play; Seary is  more hesitant about labelling. For her, Hot  Flashes is, first of all, Chris and her story,  and then ,yes, she guesses, it deals with  feminist issues.  I innocently expressed my amazement  at their ability to work together peacefully  having such different approaches towards  life. They laughed heartily at that.  Their past and their play is full of the  most passionate anger and it was reliving  that anger, too that made rehearsals torture for both of them.  At this point Jessica van der Veen  jumped in, defining true friendship as the  kind of friendship that survives the most  awful fights. Instead of turning one's back  to each other, one deals with the person  and ends up being able to love each other  after years of bitterness and silence. True  friendship.  I guess that is what Hot Flashes is about  then.  Hot Flashes: On the Rocky Road to Redemption will be performed at the  Vanvcouver East Cultural Centre on Sep  10, 6:00pm; Sep 11, 11:30 am; Sept 12,  5:00pm; Sep 16, 5:30pm; and Sep 19,  6:45pm.  Lilith & Eve  a Crystal Castle production  written and directed by Kathy MacKenzie  performed by Odessa Shuquaya and Laura  Nordin  The Hebrew Talmud and Kabbalah  give an account of Lilith as Adam's first  wife. Whether she chose to leave the Garden of Eden or whether she was expelled  from it, remains unclear. What is known is  that the reason for Lilith's leaving was her  refusal to lie beneath her husband.  Subsequently, Lilith is exiled from humankind. As an immortal spirit, unable to  bear children, she roams the earth, gaining  great knowledge of nature. Lilith becomes  a witch-like figure—her independence and  sexual promiscuity make her a model of  evil.  Today, Lilith is often regraded as a role  model for the modern woman. Her uncompromising way of life stands in contrast to  Eve, viewed as the mother of mankind in  Christian tradition and whose name is associated with dedication to the family and  motherhood.  Lilith and Eve is Kathy MacKenzie's  first play. She originally wrote it as a requirement of an English Literature course  for her Bachelor of Fine Arts after convincing her professor to let her write a play instead of an essay. Having read Milton's  Paradise Lost in class, the idea for Lilith and  Eve was born.  Neither Lilith nor Eve, MacKenzie  says, is a traditional role model for women.  Her play, setting up immortal Lilith as the  narrator who shares her memories of Eve,  does not want to take sides.  The way the play is structured, the  audience initially watches the events  through Lilith's eyes. We adopt her feeling  of superiority over the dependent Eve.  Gradually, this impression changes.  Lilith, although seemingly free, is isolated and lonely in her independence. Expelled from humankind, unable to bear  children, she lacks the connection to people Eve possesses.  In Lilith and Eve, MacKenzie wants to  suggest a form of synthesis of the two  archtetypical women in the Christian tradition as a possible figure of identification  for women today.  Lilith and Eve will be performed at the  The Blinding Light Cinema on Sep 12,  12:30pm; Sep 13, 5:15pm; Sep 15, 9:15pm;  Sep 17,11:00pm; Sep 18, l;30pm; and Sep  19,6:45pm.  takes centre stage  £l2±  "■"*  EJ?1  9|f  j  Other Women  a Rumble Production  written by Adrienne Wong  directed by Noah Drew  performed by Hiro Kanagawa, Maiko Bae  Yamamoto, Kevin MacDuff, Khaira Le, and  Adrienne Wong  Having recently graduated from  Simon Fraser University with a Bachelor of  Fine Arts, Adrienne Wong presents her first  play, Other Women. It is produced with  Rumble Production, a company she has  been working with as an administrator for  two-and-a-half years.  Her play was inspired by her own family history. Other Women takes place at the  Wong family house. Genevieve, a Chinese  French-Canadian woman has become pregnant from an adulterous affair. She visits  her grandparents' house in search of answers to her situation.  In that house, past and present magically interweave. Thirty years earlier, her  grandmother had to deal with the fact that  her husband had been married to another  woman in China from whom he was separated due to the 1923 ExclusionAct, which  barred Chinese people from immigrating  to Canada.  Only after the ExclusionAct was lifted  in 1947 was Genevieve's grandfather's first  wife able to immigrate to Canada. That  meant the two wives ended up having to  live together in the same house. The house  became a place of struggle over territory  and primacy.  Past and present merge. Genevieve  witnesses her grandparents' situation and  gets an opportunity to learn from their mistakes.  Wong's play concerns changing traditions—her grandfather had two wives;  Genevieve has betrayed her husband. It is  a play about Chinese immigrants having  to straddle two cultures. It is also a play  centred on women and their way of dealing with the traditions they grew up in.  Wong says she does not want to judge  Chinese people's pre-Communist traditions, in which polygamy was accepted and  women were confined to the strict hierarchies in the husband's family. These aspects  of history are also a part of her own history.  Other Women will be performed at the  Firehall Arts Centre on Sep 10,3:30 pm; Sep  12,9:00 pm; Sep 14,5:00pm; Sep 15,7:15pm;  Sep 16,10:45pm; and Sep 18,5:45pm.  My Left Breast  a Shameless Hussy Production  written by Susan Miller  directed by Renee Iaci  performed by Deb Pickman  After three years of sucessfully producing their own material, this year Shameless  Hussy Productions has devoted itself to  American playwright Susan Miller's one  woman play, My Left Breast. "It is a very  well-written play which is deeply personal  and at the same time, very political," says  Deb Pickman.  The autobiographical My Left Breast  deals with Miller's survival through breast  cancer, her "redefinition of self when all  selfs are off." It is a provocative, touching  and at the same time, humorous piece.  Preparing for the production, Pickman  did a lot of research about breast cancer.  She talks about how women are still very  much left alone in their fight against the  disease. The causes of breast cancer are still  unclear. Doctors are often unable to diagnose the specific form of cancer, so women  end up having to research themselves to  find out the best possible treatments.  My Left Breast approaches the subject  directly and without false shame. It is  haunting in the way in which, as Pickman  says, " it leaves us with questions. Why is  that woman up against the system? There  are a lot of heroic stories about women that  haven't been written, but here is one."  My Left Breast will be performed at The  Vancouver East Cultural Centre on Sep 12,  7:15pm; Sep 13,9:15 Tues; Sep 14,3:00pm;  Sep 17,11:15pm; Sep 18,3:45 pm, and Sep  19,11:00am.

SEPTEMBER 1999  SEPTEMBER 1999 Arts  Alissa Lebow and Cynthia Madansky are...  just treyf enough  by Shana* Myara  TREYF  created byAlissa Lebow and Cynthia  Madansky  New York, New York, 1998  [screened at this year's Out on Screen Queer  Film and Video Festival in Vancouver]  With charm, warmth and much  chutzpah, Alissa Lebow and Cynthia  Madansky—two Jewish lesbians who met  at an alternative Passover seder and fell in  love—have created an extraordinary film  about being "unkosher," or, treyf.  What to outsiders may seem like a contradiction—being both a Jew and a lesbian-  -the two filmmakers explore with great  comfort and skill. For them, it has never  been a question of one or the other—their  religion or their sexuality—but more a  question of how to rewrite the old to fit  with the new; how to grapple with the trappings of Judaism which contradict their  political and personal views.  To this end, Trey/explores the conjoining of the two women's Jewish upbringing, family histories, culture and loyalties  with their independent, progressive, loving and lesbian lives.  Treyf (pronounced trafe), the Yiddish  word for unkosher, is usually used when  referring to pork or shellfish, or to other  foods or dietary habits that are deemed  unacceptable by Kashrut, Jewish dietary  laws.  It is also common, however, to use  "treyf to describe worldviews, attitudes or  behaviours that simply go against what is  typically thought of as acceptable or kosher in Judaism.  For extra detail, the filmmakers playfully interweave images of early kosher  meat preparation videos into their regular  footage. A stoic voice from behind grainy  photos of raw chicken and red meat informs us that special preparations are required to serve the meat as kosher.  Later, at a local deli, Madansky remarks that she keeps a kosher house out  of habit. To this, Lebow replies, "You're  vegetarian, not kosher."  Thus, Lebow and Madansky explain,  to be treyf, as they proudly are, "is to be  insider enough to know what treyf is, and  to be outsider enough to be treyf."  This statement is the backdrop to everything else in the movie: it is present when  Madansky and Lebow stroll hand-in-hand  down a grocery aisle picking up packages  of Streit's and Manishewitz foods. It is  present when they absenhnindedly add  carrot slices togefilte fish while listening to  messages on their answering machine from  other Jewish lesbians. It is present, most  prominently, in their viewpoints, in their  rejection of the state policies of Israel which  prevent peace, in their rejection of religious  fanaticism and of Israel's "illegal settlements" (as they proudly re-name them) in  the West Bank.  On a trip to Israel, Madansky and  Lebow record their wanderings in Jerusalem. Neither can quite reconcile her feelings towards Israel. Madansky recalls her  days of living in Jerusalem, throwing "wild  lesbian parties" in an apartment building  amongst Orthodox Jews and traditional  families. She tells this story outside of the  same building, a nondescript "low- rent"  tenement where members of a presumably  religious family—a mother, father and two  children—exit through the front door.  She remembers forging strong friendships with Jewish and Palestinian feminists  who fought for peace in the region. Her attachment to the country remains, despite  all her reservations.  Lebow feels only the ever-present tension in the area. She focuses on the continually expanding borders of West Jerusalem,  and the influx of right wing Jews from the  United States who aim to populate and  protect the small pockets of land they wish  to inhabit and never trade for peace.  Partly autobiographical, Treyf 'goes on  to explore the two women's coming of age,  "obsessed with being Jewish," "obsessed  with the Holocaust," "obsessed with what  is said about Jews," and more.  In one scene, Lebow and Madansky  clip article after article from a seemingly  endless stack of newspapers. The clippings  soon grow into a pile too large for the average scrapbook. They describe, in addition,  f^t   Western Canada's  f 1      Lesbian & Gay  Bookstore  Open Daily 10am to 1 lpm  Our Books/Our Issues  Gay Fiction  Lesbian Fiction  Our Magazines & Journals  AIDS/Health  Humour  Erotica  Queer Theory  Feminist Theory  Biographies, Essays, Poetry  Religion & Spirituality  Art & Photography  Community  Little Sister's Book & Art Emporium  1238 Davie Street, Vancouver, B.C.

The difficulties in articulating, forging  and celebrating a Jewish lesbian identity are  further revealed, quite comically, in the  filmmakers' attempt to bring together all  the Jewish lesbians in their community at a  converted synagogue.  As the RSVPs on Lebow and  Madansky's answering machine gather, it  becomes clear that there are as many interpretations to the term "Jewish lesbian" as  there are guests. Most obvious is the fact  that most of the women invited are  Ashkenazi Jews, although the filmmakers  note their attempts to invite more women  of Sephardic backgrounds.  Other guests feel more separated from  Jewish customs and practices: one caller  wonders "how 'Jewish' she has to be" to  be welcome at the event. Another woman  leaves a message explaining: "I'm Jewish  and I'm a lesbian, but I don't consider myself a Jewish lesbian."  As expected, the film ends with images  of the many Jewish lesbians who have gath-  mwhwmwwvwm  Massage  Therapy  Craniosacral  Therapy  315-2150 West Broadway,  Vancouver, BC  ered at the old synagogue. They are, of  course, all treyf. And proud.  One woman, wearing a short black  skirt and long black boots, bends over and  flashes her tuchus [Yiddish for rear end] at  everyone in the room. She's treyf. Others  plant affectionate kisses on their friends  and girlfriends. They, too, are treyf.  Even more memorable is a woman  named Fran Drescher who describes growing up in the fifties, attending an all-girls'  school. She recalls her days there, alluding  to her involvement in its clandestine lesbian community.  With a smirk, she remarks, "God bless  that school."  Treyf, in short, is a documentary which  is not only familiar with its subject matter,  buf'insider" enough to balance reverence  and irreverence, history and interpretation  with great insight, sensitivity and wit. It is  '"outsider" enough to wear its name with  pride.  Thank you Out on Screen Vancouver  for showing it.
