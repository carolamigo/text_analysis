You're it! Remember the  game of Tag - you'd chase down the slowest person and tag them with your hand?  Well in the name of team spirit, Elinor  Caplan, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and her Liberal colleagues are  playing a nasty game of tag.  Last month, Caplan introduced into  Parliament the federal government's new  immigration bill. Bill C-31 is designed to  "close the back door" on 'illegal' migrants  and "open the front door" to 'legitamte'  ones. In fact, the bill slams all the doors shut  by further limiting, deterring and  criminalizing the movement of people into  Canada [see Nandita Sharma's article on  page 8]. If passed, Caplan's proposals  would continue to exploit and render migrant women more vulnerable upon arrival  in this country.  While Caplan is campaigning for these  inhumane and anti-woman policies, her tag  playmates and their corporate buddies are  actively creating the desparate conditions  that force women to flee their homes in the  first place. What a team!  As Spring has officially arrived, it's  time to shed the winter sweaters (with layers of cat hair) and rejuvenate! Internationally, nationally and locally in Vancouver,  May 1st was celebrated as a day for working class people to protest corporate  globaliztion.  Speaking on behalf of DARE (Direct  Action against Refugee Exploitation) Gaik  Cheng Khoo spoke about the Fujianese  women migrants who fled desperate conditions in China - conditions created by globalization. Most of these women are still  locked in prison. Khoo also pointed out that  as long as there is globalization, policing  the borders will not stop the flow of people. She said, "such punitive measures to  curtail legal immigration don't address the  heart of the problem: the ever-healthy demand of American and Canadian business  for vulnerable unprotected labour."  Leah Diana from the Filipino Nurses  Support Group spoke about the inherent  racist, sexist and classist immigration policies of Canada. Filipino nurses are not allowed to work in their profession despite  their education and qualifications. Instead,  they're employed in Canada (under the  Live-in Caregiver Program) as domestic  workers.  Daisy Kler from Rape Relief reminded  the crowd of activists that fighting for human rights and ending violence means  fighting for women's rights.  In February of this year, a  Biocolonialism Forum was held in Vancouver. The forum dealt with the theft of indigenous peoples' DNA and the destruction of indigenous communties from western development. It was amazing.  The power and knowledge that the  three Aboriginal speakers, Debra Harry,  Priscilla Settee and Viola Thomas (see page  9 for full story) shared with the audience  were inspiring.  f      W   OMEN  Our appreciation to the following supporters who became members of VSW, renewed  their memberships, or who made donations during the month of March.

Liberation from all forms of oppression  will happen, just as surely as new life is  birthed from spring. While there is still so  much violence against women, we must remain true to the struggle.  This is especially true when we look at  the recent execution of Nguyen Thi Hiep, a  Vietnamese-Canadian woman. In 1996 she  was arrested in Vietnam for allegedly trying to smuggle 5 kilograms of heroin out  of the country.  Nguyen and her mother were returning from a vacation when they boarded a  plane in Hanoi, bound for Toronto. The Vietnamese authorities detained them and  found the heroin in luggage the women  were taking for an aquaintance.  Nguyen and her mother were tried and  convicted as drug smugglers despite evi  dence of her innocence presented by the Canadian government.  She spent 4 years in a rat-infested  prison and was often shackled to her bed.  Before dawn on April 24, Nguyen was executed by a firing squad.  While the Canadian government made  an effort to intervene on behalf of Nyguyen  and her mother, it was to no avail.  We can only hope that the Canadian  government will also focus on the violence  committed against women here in this  country.  On a more celebratory note, women are  creating poetry, art, fiction and much more  for Asian Heritage Month and the  Mayworks community festival in Vancouver. Don't forget to check out bulletin board,  on pages 17 and 18 for details on all the  wonderful women-specific events.  Summer, summer where are you? The  clouds keep moving over the sun and the  spring flowers are desperately trying to  push their way out from under the rain.  Meanwhile, inside Kinesis, we're busy  strategizing about crazy new ways to coax  out some warm weather so we can go  camping!  Yes, dear readers, we do occasionally  emerge from our mango-hued walls to sniff  the fresh spring air and get back to nature.  Of course, no camping trip would be complete without a copy or two of Kinesis.  We're proud of the multiple uses of our  paper: it disseminates important information, creates a forum for different women's  voices and it makes the leanest, meanest  paper boats. Of course, it can conveniently  stand in as kindling for a reluctant camp-  fire (although we would prefer mainstream  dailies to be used); check out our back  cover!  Well now that we've done the usual  weather reports and expressed our  yearnings for more sunshine, it's time to  get down to the real buzz of what's been  happenin' inside Kinesis this month. Needless to say, we've been having lots of fun  producing this month's issue. Along the  way, we've been helped by a brand new  volunteer, Nicole Basset. Nicole heard  about us through one of her Women Studies classes and decided to come in and see  what we were all about. She's been a great  help during this production and we look  forward to seeing her again next month.  Thanks Nicole and welcome. We'd also like  to extend a very warm welcome to new  writers Naomi North, Priscilla Settee,  Debra Harry, Heather Millar and Meg  Torwl. Your writing has definitely helped  make this month's issue a must read. We'd  also like to thank Agnes Huang for editing  our centrespread on Biocolonialism [see  p.9-12]. Transcribing was done in part by  our ever-faithful volunteer, Robyn Kelly.  As you can probably tell, we get really  excited when new volunteers and writers  get involved with Kinesis. In fact, we absolutely love it and we've come up with a new  reason to recruit more women!  Our editorial board is eagerly searching for new members! Potential members  have to have been involved with Kinesis  as volunteers. So, if you've been hangin'  around here for a while, helping out with  proofing or some other type of volunteer  work and would like to be more involved  with the inner workings of the paper, give  Georgina a jingle at 255-5499. She'll fill you  in on all other requirements and responsibilities. Oh and rumour has it that if you  bring her a jar of olives, you can become a  lifetime member of the editorial board! Be  careful what you wish for! Yikes!  Well, while we anxiously await the arrival of warm weather, Kinesis and VSW  volunteers and staff have decided to run  off to the mountains for some good old  fashion.. .meetings?!  Yes folks, we'll be taking a weekend  out to focus on the restructuring of both Kinesis and VSW. We can't wait to see what  comes out of this meeting and we'll be sure  to keep you informed! Hey, maybe we'll  move our office to the mountains for the  summer! Hmmm, let's see, how can we  come up with a compelling enough reason  for this? Any ideas?  While we're strategizing, we want  to make sure and remind you that production for our June issue will be from May  15-22. So for all you curious readers who  are wondering what we really look like and  what we really do here, here's your chance  to come down in person and check us out!  We guarantee a warm welcome.  SIS Dear Kinesis,  I am offended by the Vancouver Status of Women Coordinating  Collective's (CC) response to Joan Meister's letter regarding the  non-accessibility of the Angela Davis talk [March 2000 issue].  To say this was an "oversight" serves to exemplify the ableist  perspective that the CC tries to deny with its Public Relations  statement "VSW is committed to issues of accessibility." Although a number of efforts have been made by individual  members of VSW, I witnessed little activity from the organization as a whole to support this claim. As individuals can only  do so much, change is needed at the structural level.  Further, during my tenure at VSW, my opinion was not sought,  nor to my knowledge, any other women of the disability community. Whose definition of accessibility is the VSW using? If  myself and these other women had been consulted, perhaps  VSW would have realized that a TTY [teletype device] with few  operators and a door entrance with a 2-3" lip, despite an elevator, is not accessibility but tokenism.  I also could not overlook this same level of "commitment" in  Kinesis. In her letter, Joan made it clear that Angela Davis did  not speak of ableism in her talk and this was sad. How then  could Kinesis on the very next page print the Angela Davis  review as follows: "With the trust and blessings of the elders  there is hope that youth will figure out the issues of racism,  sexism, homophobia and imperialism..." Apparently, ableism is  not a concern. It was somehow "overlooked" in the article on  aging lesbians that the Centre is not accessible.  I feel deeply insulted that VSW chose to not deal with the issue  in any real way and is dismissive of the very concern it purports to uphold. The arrogant stance the CC has chosen to take  adds insult to injury.  The CC owes Joan Meister and the rest of us women with disabilities a sincere apology and a real commitment to issues of  accessibility as defined by women with disabilities themselves.  I also believe that CC members may want to examine their own  belief systems about disability as their letter suggests that this  may be necessary.  Dear Kinesis,  It was with 'anger  and disappointment'  that I read the CC's  response to Joan  Meister's concerns  over inaccessibility  of the VSW reception  for Angela Davis at  the Vogue Theatre.  As a Kinesis  volunteer and member  of VSW, I am  extremely  embarrassed by the  arrogance and  defensiveness  exhibited in the  CC's response  letter. "Oversight"?  Please! This was a  huge mistake. And  "ironic"? I think  not.  Rather than touting  our commitment to  accessibility, we  may want to take a  closer look at what  deeper ableist  attitudes this  "oversight" may be  indicative of.  We certainly can't  expect to end  oppression in  general, if we are  unable or unwilling  to examine our own  oppressive  behaviours and  attitudes.  In sisterhood,  Colleen Sheridan News  National Child Benefit program discriminates against women on welfare:  Anti-poverty court  challenge  by Georgina Farah  Anti-poverty organizations are ready  to launch a human rights complaint against  the federal and provincial governments.  The groups say that the current National  Child Benefit program, designed to end  child poverty is in fact discriminatory towards families on social assistance.  The court challenge is being headed by  the National Anti-Poverty Organization  (NAPO), the Charter Committee on Poverty Issues (CCPI) and the Centre for Equality Rights in Accomodation (CERA). The  three organizations have just received  funding from the federal Court Challenges  Program to proceed with a Charter of  Rights and Freedoms case. The program offers funding for human rights cases and has  conditionally approved the National Child  Benefit challenge.  A committment to "end child poverty  by the Year 2000" was made by all federal  parties in 1989. However, since that time  child poverty has increased by 60 percent.  In another effort to address the situation,  both the federal and provincial governments launched the National Child Benefit  (NCB) program in 1998.  Under the NCB program a monthly  supplement is provided in addition to the  Canada Child Tax Benefit already in place.  The Child Tax Benefit is $1104 per year for  the first child (and less for the second and  third). The NCB supplement amounts up  to $977 per year for the first child (less for  the second and third children).  Families on welfare receive the base  Child Tax Benefit but are not eligible for  the additional NCB supplement.  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) has reported that  cuts to federal transfers, such as the NCB  supplement has lead to dramatic financial  losses for many single mothers on welfare.  NAC also estimates that 82 percent of sin-  BORED?  Need i lrrle intellectual  stimulation?  Join rhe Kinesis team as  a proofreader!  CALL: 255-5499  Moving?  Let us  know!  Nome:  Old Address:.

At least 57 percent  of those single moms are living in poverty.  When the NCB program was created,  the federal government arranged with  provinces to deduct the supplement from  welfare payments and put it into programs  for low income 'working' families.  NAPO has described the governments'  tactics as "discriminatory in the worst way"  towards families on welfare. It has reported  that two thirds of children living in poverty do not recieve the benefit because their  parent(s) are on social assistance.  Jean Swanson, from the Vancouver  based organization, End Legislated Poverty  has said that the federal and provincial governments do not provide welfare recipients  with the NCB supplement in order to 'motivate' people to work. Swanson described  the legislation as "poor bashing" and said  "all provincial welfare systems that require  single parents to take low income jobs-  should be changed to recognize single parent mothers as an occupation."  According to Swanson, corporate think  tanks often come up with programs that  favour low income families in an effort to  relieve corporations from paying decent  wages (governments make up the rest).  Swanson warns that schemes like this  eliminate decent paying jobs and move towards abolishing minimum wage.

What's News  by Isabel Fitzgerald  Canadian women fall  deeper into poverty  Federal government cutbacks in transfer payments to the provinces and the repressive welfare policies of provincial governments, notably in Ontario, Alberta and  British Columbia, have combined to increase women's poverty rates to a 20 year  high. A recent report on women and poverty notes that, almost 30 years after the  Royal Commission on the Status of Women  issued its report, there has been virtually  no decrease in rates of poverty amongst  Canadian women.  According to "A Report Card on  Women and Poverty," a report from the  Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,  almost 19 percent of adult women in  Canada are living in poverty, the highest  rate of women's poverty in two decades.  The report found that the depth of poverty  has actually worsened for women already  living in poverty, most of whom are sole  support mothers or women over 65. Fifty-  six percent of women heading lone parent  families are poor with a level of poverty  that leaves them, on average, at least,  $9,000 below the poverty line.  The report further notes that more and  more women are working in part-time,  part-year, contract or temporary jobs. These  jobs offer minimum job security and  threaten to raise women's poverty rates  even further in the low- wage global  economy future.  Filipino nurses denied  the right to work  Filipino nurses are organizing in Vancouver to expose the links between public  fear and hysteria over nursing shortages,  and a government and private sector covert agenda to privatize the Canadian health  care system.  In a statement issued in April, the Vancouver-based Filipino Nurses Support  Group (FNSG) charged that Immigration  Canada policies deny nurses their vocation  and instead are used as cheap labour in privatized health care system. Nurses educated in other countries, are denied the right  to work in Canada According to the FNSG,  through immigration policies such as the  Live-In Caregiver Program, highly quali  fied Filipino nurses are recruited and  streamed into live-in domestic and home  support work and deprived of the opportunity to seek work as nurses. Nurses who  manage to fulfill immigration criteria for  landed immigrant status freeing them to  seek other work face governmental and institutional barriers that prevent them from  returning to nursing work. This in turn  forces them into low wage nursing care and  home support work.  While acknowledging that the 'nursing shortage' is based on a number of factors including a lack of nursing education  spaces, bed closures and cuts to health care  budget, the FNSG points to how immigration policies benefit private health care  companies and associations by providing  a pool of skilled low-wage health workers.  One private sector health care delivery  company, BC Pricare, employs over 7,000  health care workers, many of whom are  nurses from the Philippines. The FNSG  statement also decries "the divisions between nurses from the Third World and  First World nurses" arguing that such divisions "cheapen the dignity and reputation of the nursing profession and deteriorate the quality of health care."  For more information contact the FNSG  at 451 Powell St., Vancouver, BC. Phone/Fax  (604) 215-1103 email: pwc@netcom.ca  Access to abortion  declining in Canada  The Canadian Abortion RightsAction  League (CARAL), a national organization  dedicated to ensuring women have access  to safe and accessible abortion services, is  raising the alarm that the number of  women who have to travel outside of their  home provinces or territories to access abortion services is steadily increasing. According to CARAL, with current inequities in  reciprocal billing between provinces, many  of these women are having to cover the cost  of abortion procedures out of their own  pockets.  CARAL's comments follow the release  of an April Statistics Canada report on abortion which identified an overall increase in  the number of abortions performed in  Canada since 1995, an increase largely attributable to the incidence of abortion in the  20 to 24 age group. The Statistics Canada  report also revealed a decrease in the  number of hospitals performing abortions  with an increase in the number performed  in private clinics. In 1990, private clinics  performed 22 percent of abortions in  Canada, but by 1995 this number had increased to 33 percent, and by 1997 had  grown to an all-time high of 36 percent.  "This is an upsetting trend because  most are located in urban areas and may  have fees attached to abortion services,"  said Marilyn Wilson, CARAL's Executive  Director. "Women who can pay these fees  as well as the cost of travel and accommodation have access to clinic abortions while  poorer women can not afford this privilege."  For more information contactMarilyn  Wilson, Executive Director of CARAL at (613)  789-9956.  Taliban regime sacks  women civil servants  Afghanistan's ruling Taliban has laid  off thousands of civil servants including all  female employees and teachers. According  to civil servants, those affected made up as  many as 50 percent of staff in some ministries. The ruling militia had already  stopped paying its female military staff well  before the layoffs.  Under the Taliban regime, women  have been barred from work and education  outside the home. Earlier reports indicated  that women routinely face attacks in the  street unless accompanied by a male relative and have limited access to medical  services. Many families are headed by widows in Afghanistan, which has been in a  state of war since the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. The number of women beggars  is on the rise, while families attempting to  migrate to neighbouring Iran and Pakistan  are being increasingly turned away.  There was no sign of immediate plans  to help the laid off staff or find substitute  means of livelihood. While the government  has said that if job opportunities come up  in the future the laid off staff will be given  first chance at them, there was no indication whether that offer extends to laid off  female workers.  Source: Globe and Mail  Lesbian and gay  rights under attack  According to a recent international report, lesbian and gay parents continue to  face discrimination and harassment in their  struggle for custody and other parental  rights.  The report cites the following examples  as typical of the type of difficulties gay and  lesbian parents face worldwide:  • A lesbian mother in the Czech  Republic won custody of her  children but only after a  humiliating battery of  psychological and other tests.  • In Ireland, Italy and Serbia,  adoption is restricted to  heterosexual married couples.  • In Israel, a lesbian couple whose  son was born in the United  States, where they established  second parent adoption, are  now fighting for legal  recognition that they are both  the mothers of the child.  The report, "Conceiving Parenthood:  Parenting and the Rights of Lesbian, Gay,  Bisexual and Transgender People and Their  Children," was published by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights  commission, and argues that "the way the  state creates families and the ways the state  intervenes in families are inconsistent and  incoherent, and, in many ways in most  countries, just a mess."  Despite this, there are some hopeful  stories. Recently, in Portugal, a gay father  denied custody of his child appealed the  European Court on Human Rights and won  over arguments that the child should be  raised in a traditional Portuguese family.  In Costa Rica, a move to restrict single  women from using artificial insemination  was defeated.  The report recommends that the definition of family and parenthood in all laws  and government policies should be more  inclusive, and sexual orientation, gender  identity and marital status should be integrated into anti-discrimination law.

Postcard campaign  challenges feds on  child benefit  compiled by Heather Millar   Women from the Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre in Vancouver and End  Legislated Poverty have developed a postcard petition calling on the federal government to protect the Natinal Child Benefit  from being deducted from provincial welfare payments. Due to a minimal increase  of the supplement in the recent federal  budget, the monthly amount being deducted from BC provincial welfare payments has also increased. Together with the  BC Family Bonus deduction, families in BC  will lose approximately $182 per month per  child from their welfare entitlement.  People on welfare are unable to receive  the supplement component of the Child  Benefit which lower wage workers receive.  Instead, the provincial government actually  collects the supplement (up to a maximum  of $977 per year for the first child) from the  feds for each child on welfare. There are  no restrictions in place which require the  government to pass this supplement on.  The postcard campaign calls for the  government to stop catering to corporate  greed and to ensure that the child benefit  actually addresses the needs of Canada's  poorest children. The women in the group  are asking that organizations across Canada  work with them to get the postcards signed  and mailed to the Prime Minister on October 17 2000, the International Day for the  Eradication of Poverty.

VSW and DEWC have reclaimed the  2nd Sunday of May from its conservatives  roots as a day to appreciate and honour all  women working to raise children on their  own.  Single mothers in the Canadian state  are facing the ongoing mainstream media  backed 'father's rights' movement, as well  as a backlash from the legal and mediation  systems. Poverty and the lack of social support programs, such as a national childcare  program, further undermine mothers and  kids. More and more children, particularly  of Aboriginal, immigrant, refugee and poor  women are at threat of being apprehended,  through biases of the state and mother-  blaming media culture.  The Vancouver Status of Women continues to publish a Single Mother's Resource Guide to inform moms of the resources available to them. The guide has  tips from housing rights, childcare, welfare  and support services to employment, legal  assistance, First Nations resources and free  services available.  For more information about the Single  Mother's Resource Guide, call the Vancouver  Status of Women at (604) 255-6554 or fax  (604) 255-7508 or e-mail vsw@web.net. Come  celebrate the strength and endurance of single  moms - Single Mom's Day at 12:00p.m. on  May 14th, buses will leave the DEWC at 44  East Cordova Street to whisk women and children away to a day of food, festivities, fun and  monitors to play with the kids!

Creating Change for  Deaf Women of BC  compiled by Aseefa Merali   A relatively new organization called  Bright Place for Deaf Women of B.C. is  launching a project to address the needs of  deaf, deaf-blind and hard of hearing  women in women's organizations across  B.C.  Bright Place was incorporated as a  non-profit society in November, 1998 by  eight founding members whose hope was  to improve the lives of deaf women in the  Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.  Bright Place is an inclusive organization  comprised of deaf, deaf-blind and hard of  hearing women from diverse ethnic, economic and education backgrounds.  "Creating Change for Deaf Women of  BC," Bright Place's first project will address  the specific needs of deaf women. The  project intends to focus on two arenas of  action.  Firstly, it will provide information  about oppression and violence against  women of deaf, deaf-blind and hard of  hearing communities. "We work towards  making positive changes for deaf, deaf-  blind and hard of hearing women by empowering them to be a part of positive social change" declares Esther Shinkawa, the  project coordinator.  Secondly, the project will identify and  work towards breaking down barters faced  by these women in accessing services of  "hearing" women organizations.

Feature  Deconstructing the myth of 'girl' violence:  The denial of race in the  murder of Reena Virk  by Yasmin Jiwani  Throughout the 17 day trial of Kelly Ellard  (a young white woman convicted for murdering a young South Asian woman named Reena  Virk),Yasmin jiwani from the Feminist Research Education Development and Action  Centre (FREDA) and members from Justice for  Girls observed and documented the proceedings. They looked at the ways in which issues  of race, class, gender and age intersected in the  courtroom along with how Virk's murder was  understood and framed in a legal context.  FREDA and Justice for Girls also noted  the ways in which young witnesses—particularly young women—were treated by the court.  They heard a total of 16 testimonies of young  people who were either in the vicinity or present  at the beating.  Jiwani previously wrote on the murder of  Reena Virk in Kinesis, December/January  1998' "The erasure of race: analyzing the murder of Reena Virk."  On April 20, Madame Justice Nancy  Morrison sentenced Kelly Ellard to a life  sentence with parole eligibility in five  years—the least amount of time she would  have to spend behind bars as a young offender. Three weeks earlier, Ellard was convicted of the second-degree murder of  Reena Virk, a South  Asian teen from Victoria, B.C. [Editor's  Note: the maximum  conviction for parole  eligibility is seven  years as a young offender. Warren  Glowatski, also convicted in the second  degree murder of  Reena Virk was sentenced to life, with  parole eligibility in  seven years].  In her sentencing decision,  Morrison stated:  "The motive was not  racism." In so doing,  the judge highlighted  the narrow interpretations of racism applied to this particular case and its erasure in the courtroom.  Morrison portrayed Ellard as a person who loves animals, had positive, caring relationships  with her family and friends, and posed a  low risk to society in general. By implication, the judge suggested that racists don't  love animals, have no positive relations  with others, and pose a high risk in terms  of criminal behaviour.  To confine racism to just these types of  individuals does nothing to recognize the  systemic nature of racism. It also deflects  Legitimacy  was ascribed  to those  behaviours  and  characteristics  reflective of a  middle-class  background.  attention away from the inequalities and  power differentials perpetuated by racism.  Ultimately, the actions of Kelly Ellard  were safeguarded as the actions of a white  girl from a privileged class background  who happened to hang out with the 'wrong  crowd.' As a result of their influence, she  'happened' to kill Reena Virk, a 14-year-  old girl of South Asian origin.  The sheer brutality of the murder was  rendered insignificant by the judge's decision. A decision that also reflected, despite  the numerous educational initiatives directed at the judiciary, an appalling lack of  understanding about race and racism.  On the night of November 14, 1997,  Reena Virk was attacked by a group of  seven girls and one boy in a small suburb  outside of Victoria. After enduring a terrible beating, Virk staggered across a bridge  in an attempt to get home. She was followed by Kelly Ellard and Warren  Glowatski, told to take off her shoes and  jacket, and then viciously beaten into unconsciousness.  Ellard and Glowatski dragged her  body into a waterway known as "the  Gorge," where she struggled for life. Ellard  held her foot over Reena's head until she  drowned.  Glowatski was  convicted of second-  degree murder last  year. Neither Ellard  nor Glowatski knew  Reena Virk—they  had only met her  that night.  According to  the pathologist's testimony, the injuries  Virk suffered that  night would have  killed her, even if she  had not been  dragged to the water  and drowned. She  noted that Virk had  been kicked 18 times  in the head and her  internal injuries  were so severe as to  result in tissues being crushed between  the abdomen and  backbone.  She added that the injuries were similar to those received from a car being driven  over a body.  This brutal killing sparked a moral  panic across the nation. Even in international circles, the story of Reena Virk came  to symbolize the purported trend of growing violence among and by girls.  This panic continues to escalate despite  research which demonstrates that aggravated assault by girls is statistically low and  that approximately 75 per cent of violent  youth crimes are committed by young  males.  According to research cited by  Margaret Reitsma-Street, less than four in  every 100,000 girls are charged for aggravated assaults, and most charges against  girls are for non-compliance (incomplete  community hours or failing to appear at a court  hearing) or property offences (like petty theft).  In the current analysis  on girl violence, the real  and perceived differences  among girls based on race,  class, sexual orientation or  disability are not taken  into consideration. Yet, as  Sheila Batacharya points  out in her Masters' thesis  on the Reena Virk case,  race has always been a factor in how girls and  women treat other girls  and women.  This is the legacy of  colonialism that lives on  and is apparent in the hierarchical nature of Canadian society.  Using a frame of 'girl-on-girl' violence  deflects attention from the alarming rates  of male violence that girls and young  women experience, and the inequalities  among girls. It also makes the issue a 'safer'  one to talk about because there is no discussion on race, class, sexuality or any other  form of systemic inequality. Gender becomes the focal point.  The denial of racism in this case was  negated because there were other girls of  colour involved in the first beating. It was  quickly forgotten that both Glowatski and  Ellard are white—and that they had been  instrumental in Virk's death. Similarly,  Reena's mother's statements about the racism Reena endured, and the role it played  in her daughter's tragic death, were never  addressed in the courtroom.  Yet, in Glowatski's trial, one of the witnesses mentioned that Glowatski had a beef  against South Asians because of what  "they" had done to one of his friends. In  another instance, a witness recounted that  Glowatski came to his house after the Virk  beating. When asked why he had blood on  his clothes, Glowatski lied and said he had  just beaten a Native man.  However, the interchangeability of  beating a Native man and killing a South  Asian girl was never explored by either  Crown counsel or defence counsel in either  the Ellard or Glowatski trials.  Why was a lit cigarette stubbed out on  Reena's forehead? This was never considered as a sign of racism. The erasure of racism reduced the action to one of physical  Violence is  about  power and  power is  manifested  through  privilege.  violence, motivated only by a sentiment of  retaliation.  Generally, similar acts of brutality tend  to be directed at parts of the body that are  either not visible to others, or that are only  visible to the person being injured.  For example, in cases involving torture, cigarette burns tend  to be made on the victim's  arms, fingers or hands—  where they themselves  can see the burn. In situations of intimate violence,  injuries tend to be on  those parts of the body  that are not visible to others outside the situation.  Butting a lit cigarette  on the forehead was a definitive way of marking  Virk's cultural identity as  a SouthAsian girl. (Some  SouthAsian women wear  a "bindi" on their forehead).  Although there was  no analysis of the racism  Reena Virk experienced, it  was ever-present in the  courtroom. In describing Reena's body-  hair, which was immaterial to the case, the  Crown commented how excessive body  hair is common to particular racial groups.  However, in descriptions of Kelly  Ellard, it was noted by both the defence  counsel and by the defence's witnesses just  how 'white' she is. Ellard's whiteness contrasted not only with Reena's darkness, but  also alluded to her innocence or 'purity.'  When FT, the only young Aboriginal  witness testified that he had seen Ellard wet  to her waist on the night Virk was killed,  the defence immediately asked him how  much he had had to drink that night and  how it might have influenced his perception. He was also described by the defence  as "drunken FT" and by Crown counsel as  a "practiced drinker."  A young Black woman who testified  was singled out for her 'bad character' and  past 'criminality' She was proposed by the  defence as the 'real' murderer; yet, she was  the only young woman to have had a  friendship with Virk.  Credibility of the witnesses was judged  on their appearance, demeanor, criminal  record, professional status, articulate responses, and the certainty with which they  answered questions. Legitimacy was ascribed to those behaviours and characteristics reflective of a middle-class background. While adults were considered  more credible—because of their age, profession, and status in society—young  seeVIRKpage14 Feature ^^_  Proposed new immigration act slams front door on working class women of colour:  Maintaining the master-  servant relationship  Highlights of Bill C-31's proposed changes to the Canada Immigration Act  1. Increased money and resources on interdiction (efforts to prevent  people from reaching Canada and applying as refugees).  2. Automatic detention for anyone migrating with the aid of smugglers.  3. Life sentences for convicted smugglers.  4. Denial of refugee and immigration applications for people convicted  of "serious" crimes.  5. Further restrictions on appealing a negative immigration decision.  6. Increasing the power of the government to deport people with  permanent residence status.  7. The creation of a 'permanent resident card' allowing  government to more closely monitor, track and ultimately,  deport permanent residents.  8. "New Global Case Management System": increased global  efforts between First World states to monitor, prevent and return  people entering and applying for legal status.  9. Creating 'new inadmissibility clauses' which effectively bar  the entry of persons who, for whatever reason, had to misrepresent  their situation on an immigration application.  10. Denying anyone on social assistance from sponsoring family members.  11. Forcing sponsors to repay social assistance monies received by a  sponsored family member.  12. Increasing the discretionary powers of immigration officials to  determine who is 'desirable' in Canada. People being admitted  through the Independent class will have to meet the vague and  subjective criteria of being 'flexible' and having 'transferable skills.'  Overseas resettlement claims will be determined on the basis of  Canadian 'social' and 'economic' factors.  by Nandita Sharma  On April 16, 2000, Elinor Caplan, Federal Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,  introduced Bill C-31 into the House of Commons. The bill proposes to substantially change  the 1976 Canadian Immigration Act regarding eligibility, family sponsorship, appeals,  deportation and the government's discretionary powers. Bill C-31 also introduces new elements of criminal law into the Immigration  Act.  Even the government's choice of metaphors to describe Bill C-31, the proposed  new Canadian Immigration Act, can't hide  its racist, sexist and classist intent. Elinor  Caplan, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, when presenting the new Bill said  that it was designed to "close the back  door" so that the "front door" could be left  "open."  The only reason the government is  able to introduce Bill C-31 is because it is  normal practice for Canadian society to  wage war against people of colour, women  and the poor. It is also perfectly normal to  treat these people as inferior beings, both  within and outside of Canada's borders.  Historically, entrance through a back  door signaled a person's inferior relationship to the masters of the house (this time  the quintessential white, male heads of the  Canadian nation). While the back door was  used for the masters' servants, the front  door was reserved for the masters' 'equals'.  This is exactly the intent of Bill C-31; it  is not merely a regrettable coincidence. The  changes brought in through Bill C-31 will  make it nearly impossible for working class  women and people of colour to enter  Canada as permanent residents. What is  being further restricted is not the entry of  women and people of colour living in poverty but the possibility for them to live and  work in Canada with the same rights and  protections currently being offered Canadians. Bill C-31  will ensure that  people in these  groups will have  only an "illegal"  or "temporary"  status in the country.  Creating categories of inferiority fuels capitalist globalization.  Stealing and occupying Indigenous lands, kid-  nappingAfricans,  indenturing  Asians, devaluing the work of  women and creating a 'Third World' has  produced a hierarchy.  White males are paid and treated much  better than those of us seen as "cheap labour." Bill C-31 will ensure that a cheap  labour strategy will continue to be an effective way of reaping record capitalist  profits in Canada.  It is therefore crucial that we recognize  that the intent of Bill C-31 is to legislate an  inferior status for certain groups of migrants. Despite the rhetoric and spectacular public performance of "getting tough"  on those deemed to be 'foreigners' to protect those deemed to be 'Canadians', Bill  C-31 will not stop migration. No Immigration Act will ever stop the movement of  people across Canadian borders.  Militarizing  the border, interdicting people offshore, punishing  and even killing  migrants who are  caught crossing  the border without the state's permission will not  stop migration.  Nor will the imprisonment of migrants or increased jail terms  for smugglers.  Since the  1980's, international migration  has doubled. Right now, over 125 million  people are moving around the globe in  search of a livelihood. They have been displaced by the destruction of rural 'Third  World' economies, state policies of trade  liberalization and free trade, mega-development projects, wars fueled by oil, gold,  diamonds and other things deemed more  valuable than life itself. This displacement  is a result of the white, capitalist patriarchy.  No matter what laws are created, people will continue to move. Migration is an  essential part of survival and being alive.  People will not stop moving until the systemic causes of their displacement have  been resolved.  Regardless of the government's insistence that the new ImmigrationAct "opens  the front door", the actual changes make it  much harder for most people to qualify as  documented immigrants and refugees. The  government is well aware of this fact.  The legislation forces people to enter  the country under either temporary employment visas (a system the government  will be increasingly using) or as undocumented persons. Bill C-31 ensures a globally competitive workforce through the  migration of these undocumented and temporary visa workers.  They will be a source of cheap labour  for employers since the government fails  to protect them with minimum wages and  labour standard legislation. These migrants  will also be denied access to social assistance and public services, such as health  care, education, etc. — a move designed to  reduce the cost to government and employers alike.  see BILL C-31 page 14  kTne^is Feature  Biocolonialism forum in Vancouver, BC:  ii  Resistance is fertile"  by Agnes Huang  "Fighting colonialism is not a new  struggle," stated Viola Thomas, and  "biocolonialism" is just the latest attempt  at colonization—this time aimed directly at  life itself.  Thomas of the Secwepemc First Nation  and president of the United Native Nations—a provincial organization representing off-reserve Aboriginal people in British Columbia—spoke these words as she  moderated a forum on biocolonialism.  "Biocolonialism: the Theft of Indigenous Peoples' DNA and the Destruction  of Biodiversity" was held in Vancouver on  February 24th. It featured Priscilla Settee and  Debra Harry—both Indigenous women  working at the tribal, national and international levels to challenge the efforts of scientists, corporations and governments who  commodity human and biological life.  Unfortunately, Jeannette Armstrong,  who was scheduled to speak, was unable  to participate because of illness. Armstrong  is of Okanagan Nation. She is a writer and  educator, and has been active in challenging  the Human Genome Diversity Project.  The three activists were in Vancouver for  the Union of BC Indian Chiefs' conference,  "Protecting Knowledge: Traditional Resource  Rights in the New Millennium." That conference brought together indigenous activists  and scholars from several parts of the globe.  The biocolonialism forum was co-hosted  by the United Native Nations, the Ruth Wynn  Woodward Chair of Women's Studies at  Simon Fraser University, the Urban Native  Youth Association, Direct action Against  Refugee Exploitation, Basmati Action Group,  and the Vancouver Status of Women. Funding support was provided by the SFU Women's Studies Department.  More than 120 people turned out to hear  Priscilla Settee address the negative impact  of western development on the biodiversity  worldwide, and Debra Harry speak about the  "slippery slope" genetic engineering is  barrelling down, attempting to take along  with it indigenous peoples. Both spoke  with voices of hope about the many ways  Indigenous peoples around the world are  fighting biocolonialism, all along sustaining and building their communities. [Settee's speech appears starting below, and Harry's speech appears on the next two pages.]  Before Harry spoke, Viola Thomas  told a story pointing to the real agenda  behind the genetic research taking place  and the patenting of life forms.  "I had a colleague of mine share a  story with me that in Wikwemikong [on  Manitoulin Island in Ontario,] people  were being offered $25 to give up samples of their fingernails and blood. To me,  this is a typical repeat of colonial tactics,  now carried out by scientists and corporations. Is it truly about enhancing scientific knowledge or the well-being of people? No, it is about money."  During the question-and-answer period, Nandita Sharma of the Basmati Action Group stepped up to the microphone  to speak about the possibilities of stopping  biocolonialism from going any further  down its path of destruction. At the forum,  BAG circulated a petition calling on the  Canadian government to ban all patents on  life.  Borrowing the phrase, "resistance is  fertile," Sharma said that the scariest thing  for her to hear is when people say we cannot resist what is going on. "To me that represents a 'colonization of our imagination'  and once they've got that, they do have  everything."  AgnesHuang    helped    organize    the  biocolonialism forum.  Western development and the destruction of the biodiversity:  Life on the chopping  blocks  by Priscilla Settee  Priscilla Settee is the Coordinator of the  Indigenous Peoples Program at the University  of Saskatchewan in Regina. She has worked as  an advisor with the Crucible Group of the International Development Research Centre, a  public corporation based in Ottawa.  Settee's work as the Canadian board member for the Indigenous Environmental Network,  the Indigenous Women's Network, and as the  North American board member for the Nuclear  Free and Independent Pacific, focuses on environmental and biodiversity issues. This past  March, Settee was in Selville, Spain for the  International Indigenous Forum which met  before and during the meetings of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  I come from a tiny Cree community in  Northern Saskatchewan, called  Cumberland House. In 1940, before I was  born, the government put in a huge mega-  dam upstream from my community. Within  20 years, the community went from being  a rich and bio-diverse community—including hunting and gathering, wildlife, large  birds and four-legged animate—to a community where in one year, 18 young people attempted suicide.  When we look at these social indicators existing in a so-called "First World"  country, we have to ask, "what the heck's  going on here when a government can take  a thriving community and basically set it  on its ass economically, socially and culturally?" When we look at the social and economic conditions for the world's 500 mil  lion indigenous peoples—who speak thousands of languages in over a hundred countries—we see parallels of structural underdevelopment. But, at the same time as the  social conditions are deteriorating for indigenous peoples, there's a huge groundswell  of resistance and hope countering, what I call,  the "leftovers of Western development."  I'm not going to talk about the 200-plus  environmental disasters that are situated here  in North America. I will not tell you about  the thousands of bombs that have been detonated near Deb Harry's community [in northern Nevada]. I won't speak to you about the  200 nuclear bombs that have been detonated  in the South Pacific, leaving women with the  legacy of giving birth to live jelly-fish babies.  I will not spend a lot of time on all of that  because it's too horrible.  I want to speak with a voice of hope because at the same time that 500 million indigenous souls in the world are going  through traumatic and dramatic changes,  there is also an equilibrium of resistance—  one that represents the view of life that indigenous people have come to represent.  If we look at the history of this continent  over the last 500 years, we see that indigenous  people have disappeared in the millions—  maybe 30, 40 million since Christopher  Columbus arrived here. But nowhere in the  history books is this called a human "holocaust." There's a whole chunk of history that  is left out of our children's schooling which  needs to be righted.  On the lands where indigenous peoples live over 80 percent of the world's  bio-diversity exists. Between 50 to 150 of  species disappear daily-whether they are  micro-organisms, trees or tiny insects,  they are all part of the biodiversity of life.  The disappearance of 50 to 150 species daily should send all of us out into  the streets raising hell. It's a disaster that  knows no borders.  At the same time that our bio-diversity is eaten up, taken away and exploited,  it is producing over $40 billion in profits  [a year] for pharmaceutical companies.  These companies have their offices in  New York, Toronto, Vancouver—places  where a lot of indigenous people don't  gather [or if they do, they are  marginalized from] the economy of the  nation-state.  We, the 500 million indigenous people, are defined as "minorities." By the  way, we have to look at this term because  "minority" is used by the colonizers to  refer to 80 percent of the world's population. We're a powerful force. However,  less than one percent of the [pharmaceutical companies'] $40 billion profits ever  gets back to the community from where  the bio-diversity was taken.  With the destruction of our bio-diverse communities, many roles are changing, particularly for women. In our communities, women are often the carriers of  plant knowledge and the nurturers. With  the destruction of bio-diversity, the status  of the women is being destroyed.  I'm staying [in Vancouver] with a  woman from Haida Gwaii. She was telling  me some shocking statistics about her island community. There are approximately  2,000 Haida people left in her community.  I was truly shocked at that small number.  She said that when the colonizers arrived  here, there were around 40,000 Haida people.  With the colonizer's presence, a lot of  things started to change in their  commmunities, including the introduction  of rats and deer. What was once a very bio-  diverse community is now being subjected  to all of kinds of foreign plants and animals.  This is having a tremendous impact on their  local ecology and on their local economy.  The collection and expropriation of the  "intellectual property rights" of our people have been referred to, by some of my  colleagues, as the "last act of colonialism."  When we thought there was no more left  to take from our land, it was just the beginning. What is on the chopping blocks now  is life itself.  It's not just an issue for indigenous  people, and I know most people realize that  too. It really cuts to the sanctity of life.  Mostly, the people who do the research  and who do the benefitting are white males.  see BIODIVERSITY page 12  MAY 2000 indigenous peoples:  I Debra Harry holding up genetic engineering publications  by Debra Harry  Debra Harry is Northern Paiutefrom  Pyramid Lake, Nevada. She is the Executive Director of the Indigenous Peoples  Council on Biocolonialism. In 1994, she received a three-year Kellogg Foundation  leadership fellowship and studied the field  of human genetic research and its implications for Indigenous peoples.

She earned a  master's degree in community economic development from New Hampshire College.  I do not have a science background,  but I've spent the last six years looking  at issues related to human genetic research. I've chosen to focus on human  genetic research because the more I  know, the more it scares me.  I've also focused on human genetic  research because Indigenous peoples  are on the front lines of this issue, and  often times we don't even know it.  I'm glad that [moderator] Viola  [Thomas] raised this article, "Uncorking the Gene Genie," [published in the  Globe and Mail on February 23.] If s writ  ten by Ian Wilmut. He is the researcher who  developed the technology at Roslin Institute in Scotland to clone "Dolly" (a sheep).  In the article, he says, "no one is proposing to clone humans, just save human  lives." This is an example of what my  friend Ruth Hubbard calls the "human  geno-mania."  There is a perpetuation of this in the  media. Everyday, if you read the science  section of your local newspaper or listen  to the news reports, you're gonna hear that  "the gene was discovered for this, for  that—for obesity, for baldness, for alcoholism", and so on.  This is the human geno-mania I'm referring to and that Ruth Hubbard is so critical of. She's a professor of biology at  Harvard University. She and a number of  other scientists are taking a critical look at  what's going on in this whole field of  biotechonology as it relates to human beings.  We have to ask ourselves why this  kind of coverage, this kind of hype, is being perpetuated widely across an unknowing and unsuspecting public. For one thing,  it's the public that is paying for most of the  research.  [In the United States,] we have federal  institutions like the National Institutes of  Health (NIH) giving grants to institutions  all over the country and all over the world  to do whatever kind of genetic research  they want. It's become an industry in and  of itself.  As a matter of fact, it's no longer called  genetic research or health sciences, it is  called the "life sciences industry." This includes the biotech corporations like  Monsanto and Genzyme, and all of the others.  The other thing that Ian Wilmut fails  to mention when he says that "no one is  proposing to clone human beings..." is that  the patent he applied for and was granted  includes applying technology to cloning  human beings. His patent was written  broadly enough so that, [he and his colleagues] are the patent holders for applying the cloning process to human beings.  Why do we need to be concerned about  what's going on with genetic engineering?  One, much of it is publicly funded, and two,  much of it is going on without our awareness.  We don't know what we're funding,  instead we're fed a line of hype. We think  maybe there is potential, maybe there is  promise. But it's important to be very critical about what you read and hear, and compare it with what the reality is.  To date, there have been no cures developed as a result of genetic research. You  can quote me on that, I've gotten my information from a lot of sources.  That gives you an idea on the reality  of the benefits versus the tremendous resources that are going into genetic research  and the life sciences industry.  Now, ask yourself if there's a better  way that we could make a difference in people's lives health-wise that was non-genetic  research. We're talking about billions and  billions of dollars going into this technology with no direct benefit back to the public-no direct benefit back to people who are  suffering from easily curable diseases.  That's where your public health money is  going.  We are also talking about a technology  that is inherently dangerous. It's inherently  uncontrollable and unpredictable because  we're talking about the manipulation of life  at its most basic, most minute forms.  By using genetic technologies to manipulate the molecular cells of a living organism, what scientists are doing is taking  DNA from one species and mixing it with  another That's what genetic engineering is.  You snip a piece of DNA out of this organism and you hope that it'll have the same  effect that it had in that organism in the new  organism you put it into.  The DNA recombines. That newly created form would never have existed on its  own. That newly created form could be a  micro-organism, it could be a bacteria, it  could be a virus, it could be a plant, it could  be an animal, it could be a human.  When genetic manipulation affects the  germ cells—the reproductive cells: the egg  or the sperm—it affects every subsequent  generation of that species.  When you think about the term "genetic engineering," it sounds so advanced.  It sounds like you can just create something  real or fix something, and everything's going to be fine. But that's not how genetic  manipulations work.  There's a lot of discussion by scientists  about the unpredictability of genetic manipulations, and about not knowing what  the long term impact of genetic manipulations will be. Unpredictability about what  the next generation of that new life form  will be like, or the generation thereafter.  Unpredictability about how that new being will interact with its environment and/  or how other organisms or life forms will  inter-relate with this new organism.  For instance, when they created  transgenic sheep, it involved mixing human genes with pigs. They were trying to  create a more lean, less fat pig. They  thought they would get a tall lean pig, but  what they got was something completely  different. It couldn't feel, it was blind, its  legs were crippled and crumbled under. It  had short legs, it wasn't tall.  Genetic engineering is just not an exact science and it's very frightening. Once  you create this life form, you can't recall it.  Once you have a genetically engineered  crop and that pollen starts to drift and interact within its environment, you cannot  call it back.  It's life in and of itself. It's going to  evolve, it's going to reproduce, it's going  to mutate, it's going to migrate. And because it is life, it is going to do whatever it  has to do to adapt and survive.  That's why we need to be concerned  about genetic technologies and be critical  about the kinds of headlines we see.  There are books, there are publications,  there are excellent organizations like the  Council for Responsible Genetics. I'm sure  you have Canadian'-based organizations  doing critical watches on the biotech industry. You've got to pay attention to that work  and get involved when you can.  It's not only affecting life forms, it's  also affecting the safety of your food. In fact,  much of the contaminated, GE (genetically  engineered) foods are soy. Most people who  are concerned about healthy eating are eating a lot of soy products. It's in the veggie  burgers you eat, so you've got to be concerned about this because it's pervasive and  will continue to go on until we say "no,"  as people in Europe have done.  They're making major gains [in Europe]—whole countries are saying, "no  more GE crops, no more GE foods." They  are making it a demand and they are enforcing it. And we can do the same.  When you look at human genetics, it  is a question of "genetic diversity." The rea  son indigenous people are at the forefront  of this issue is because there is a tremendous amount of genetic diversity within  our populations. We have unique gene j  pools that are not found in other parts of  the world. Our gene pools are an object of  curiousity for scientists and others.  Some of the funding I talked about earlier is going to institutions—it might be individual universities or collaborations of  universities, or national and international  research insitutions-for which the specific  intent of the research is to look at human  genetic diversity.  The one program that brought me to  this issue is called the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). It's a worldwide  effort to collect the DNA from select Indigenous populations.  [The HGDP specifically targets the 722  indigenous communities around the world considered to be "more genetically pure" and also  in danger of becoming "extinct." The goal is  to examine these peoples' "unique" DNA sequences to determine how their genetic makeup differs (diverges) from the "generic" sequence (the prototype)—based mainly on  Northern European families-in order to assess  whether their genes have any useful scientific  or medical applications. The HGDP is part of  the larger Human Genome Project (HUGO).]  [Researchers] have identified  populations from whom they want blood  samples or some kind of biological material sample. They collect those samples,  then take them back to the laboratories,  study them, sequence out the DNA, look  for genetic variations... Then what?  What do they do with genetic variations? In a lot of cases, those samples might  prove "worthless" because most human  beings are biologically the same anyways.  But sometimes you strike gold, as in the  case of the research that was done on the  Hagahai people of Papua New Guinea. In  that case, the NIH filed a patent application on their DNA. The patent was granted  in 1994. (The NIH had previously attempted to patent the DNA of indigenous  populations in Panama and the Soloman  Islands, but abandoned those patent applications.)  So now, we have a really bizarre situation where law—western property law, intellectual property rights law—is being applied to life forms. These are laws designed  to benefit the 'inventor' of something-say,  a new kind of toaster or a new microwave  oven. Inventors are meant to benefit commercially for 20 years. That's why patents  are granted.  But now, we have a situation where  patents are being granted for life, for life  forms, for seeds, for medicine, for food, for  human beings.  What this means then is that the patent holder has the exclusive monopoly, control and profit-making potential over the  [patented "object"]. They have the ability  to control food, production and reproduction. If anyone wants a plant that has been  patented, they have to pay a fee to the patent holder.  Much of this diversity [being patented]  has been nurtured, cultured, developed for  centuries by Indigenous populations. It's  theft, that's what we're talking about here,  and the ultimate reach of biocolonialism  now is at the molecular level. It's about  mining the human body for DNA genetic  resources; it's about trying to gain control  over food, medicinal germ plasms so that  someone can profit.  I have a quote here from Mae-Wan Ho.  She's a very prominent, very respected biologist. She wrote a book called, Genetic  Engineering: Dream or Nightmare?  In it, she says: "Its no accident that a  culture bent on promoting capitalism and  free enterprise should be obsessed with  things rather than processes. The notion of  gene banks and genetic resources makes it  plain that life, the process of being alive as  well as real organisms and diverse ecological communities are all negated in favour  of genes which can be grasped hold of,  possessed, preserved and exploited as commodities."  Vandana Shiva says in her latest book,  Stolen Harvest: "Over the past two decades,  every issue I've engaged in as an ecological activist and organic intellectual has revealed that what the industrial economy  calls growth and development is really a  form of theft from Nature and from people."  That's exactly what we're dealing with.  A bioethicist on [the Indigenous Peoples  Council on Biodiversity] board, George  Annas, says that if profit motives of patents were taken away, much of the problem for Indigenous people would go away.  He also says that no research on humans should be done unless there is a direct benefit to the population to be studied. That's a difficult test to meet.  Much of the research that's being proposed for Indigenous people falls into one  of two categories: anthropological genetic  research or health-related genetic research.  With anthropological genetic research,  scientists are basically looking at mitochondrial DNA (which is passed through  the mother's lineage), at white chromosome DNA (which is passed through the  father's lineage), or at ancient DNA (which  requires extracting biological material  from human remains and analysing it).  The goal of studying ancient DNA is to see  if researchers can figure out who the person was, where they came from, how long  they've been where they were found, and  who else they might be related to.  It's not as if there isn't already enough  information and knowledge about this  held by the people themselves. Indigenous  people are not sitting around asking, "who  am I, where did I come from, and who am  I related to?" We have oral histories; we  have social knowledge, cultural knowledge that answer those questions for us.  So clearly, anthropoligical genetic research doesn't meet the test of benefits. It  just can't. On the other hand, there are a  lot of risks with almost all of this research.  Anytime researchers collect biological  material, they usually clone it. This is  called 'cell immortalization'. Researchers  take an original sample of the biological  material, then culture it. The cell starts to  divide and each new cell now has a copy  of the original DNA.  So from one small blood sample or  some scraping of somebody's grandmother's bones, you start getting vials of DNA  that looks sort of like this. [Harry holds up  a bottle of water.] The longer you culture it,  the bigger the bottles you'll need.  That's an immortalized cell line. And  this is what scientists trade with each other.  This raises the problem of secondary uses of DNA. A community might  agree to participate in, say, Diabetes research but now, the scientist has these  copies in his lab which he can trade or  sell over the Internet with any of his colleagues—with or without the people's  consent.  With health-related genetic research, the design of the research is completely different. You have to look at  who has the disease [being studied] and  who doesn't. Then, you follow family  lineage and all of those kinds of things.  It's a very long-term, intensive process  if you're really going to look at a health  condition.  But if you look at much of the  health-related research actually being  proposed, if s "bleed-and-run" research.  They can't be too interested in the health  of the community because they have  their eye on the prize. All they want is  that DNA sample. All they want is 50,  100, 250 samples so they can identify  variants to see what the differences are  in the population.  The direct benefits of this so-called  health-related research are pretty elusive. You might have to wait a long time  to see any benefits.  In terms of protections for people  who participate in a research process,  it's pretty flimsy. One of your protections as a human being involved in human research is that you have to give  your "informed consent." This stems  from the Nuremburg Code.   [The  see GENETICS next page Feature  from GENETICS previous page  Nuremburg Code grew out of the case of 23  Nazi doctors on trial for crimes against humanity committed in the name of research. It was  established in 1946.]  The Code represents a starting point  in discussions about the ethical treatment  of human subjects. There is probably a similar kind of statuatory mandate within Canadian health research policies.  Every individual who participates in research has this one protection. However, there is a case in  California, involving a man—an  anglo-man from Seattle-who had  Hairy Cell Leukemia. His doctor  was treating him at UCLA and became very interested in what he  found in this man's diseased  spleen. His doctor collaborated  with a pharmaceutical company  and developed a product called the  Mo-line, based on biological materials gathered from John Moore's  spleen. This product eventually  became worth $300 billion in the  market place.  John Moore never gave his  consent [to the doctor or the pharmaceutical company to use his  spleen in such a manner]. He sued  for compensation, but the California Supreme Court said that once  the materials leave your body, you  no longer have a "property interest" in those biological materials.  When you think about informed consent being one of your only protections and then look at the Moore's case,  it's scary.  This field is so new that we don't have  much in place in terms of laws. Whafs in  place are so-called bioethical standards,  bioethical protocals but they're not laws.  In the US, there's never been a successful  challenge of a violation of inf omed consent,  even though informed consent is written  into the national health research legislation.  On the international front, there's not  much there either. There's the Nuremburg  Code, which was later changed somewhat  by the World Health Organization, and  some other standards. But really, there's not  much.  For Indigenous people, we're going to  have to use our sovereignty to protect ourselves. We've got to stop the flow of blood  from our communities; we've got to know  what researchers are doing. We can't trust  just anyone who says, "We might find the  cure for Cancer or for Diabetes."  We've got to take a critical look at all  of these [genetic research] proposals. We've  got to know how the research is designed  and what the end result is going to be.  We've got to be able to control the research  and be a partner every step of the way, if  be any kind of scientific activity within our  territory, this is how it will happen. And  we spell it out from beginning to end-this  is what's allowable, and this is what isn't.  That's one level of protection, and I  think it's the first and most important level  of protection.  We've got to get our tribal leaders  aware and up to speed [on the issues] so  they can advocate for national policies that  the research is going to benefit our communities.  We can't continue to be an object of  curiousity. We can't afford to because we're  being taken advantage of.  A good friend of mine, Virgil  Killstraight—he's Lakota—heard me talk  about this. One of the things he said to me  was: "We're nations of givers dealing with  nations of takers. We're giving people. If  we think we can help somebody, our communities will do it. Our grandmas will do  it; they'll share."  That's a good thing about us, but we've  got to be aware.  One of the things we're promoting is  the adoption of laws, ordinances at the  tribal level—or at the treaty level or on  whatever level [bands/nations] are organized—where we say that if there's going to  protect our rights. Right now, researchers  are conveniently ignoring the fact that  they're dealing with sovereign entities.  They're ignoring the fact that if their research affects a nation, they should be consulting directly with that nation before they  proceed.  They're able to get away with it because our leadership has so much on their  hands right now-they're trying to deal with  so many things. And also, biopiracy,  biocolonialism, intellectual property rights  are not a part of their vocabulary, or part of  many people's vocabulary... yet.  We've got to make it our job to raise  awareness in our communities. We've got  to network with health officials, with law  enforcement agencies.  We found out about some DNA samples from Saskatchewan [which] ended up  in an university in Texas. That DNA was  collected from people who had gone  through the judicial system. I don't think  those people ever knew [their genetic material ended up in Texas.] There was no informed consent, I don't think, in that process.  Every time we hear about these things,  we've got to investigate—who's involved,  who funded it and what were the terms of  consent? [The misuse of genetic materials]  will continue to be a problem, it's going to  proliferate. That's what we've seen already  over the last three to four years.  When I first started on this work, we  were mainly concerned about the Human  Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Now,  the NTH has at least five institutes—each  doing some kind of genetic diversity research piece.  The Human Genome Project  (HUGO)—the other major international  genome project which is attempting to map  out the whole human genome (of which  HGDP is a part)—has now announced it is  going to do some genetic diversity research.  They're calling it "SNPs" research.fSNPs  (single nucleotide polypeptides) allow researchers to identify very specific genetic markers  within the genetic makeup of certain  populations.] They're looking for tiny,  unique genetic markers across populations.  For indigenous people, the timeline is  really short. The HUGO project is expected  to complete its generic map of the human  genome by the year 2003. Between now and  then, we're going to see an intense effort to  collect the DNA of the "disappearing" [indigenous] peoples. After that, we're going  to see a lot of genetic manipulations, and  attempts to identify "unique" DNA sequences.  That means, between now and the year  2003, we're gonna see a heavy emphasis by  researchers on getting into communties to  collect DNA. And it's not just targetting indigenous people; it's targetting any community that has existed relatively isolated  or has a unique linguistic base. We're talking about lots of populations in Asia, Africa, Europe. There's a HGDP committee  set up in Europe, Latin America, North  America and the South Pacific.  That's what we're facing.  from BIODIVERSITY page 9  I don't want to create any class wars, but it  is that group of people which is benefitting  for the most part. They represent a lot of  status and a lot of power.  What all of us in our communities  must do is "get smart" because some of the  terminology that's being used is beyond  many of our own tribal languages. Some  of the concepts that are being developed in  publicly supported places, like labs and  universities, are beyond the eye of the public. There's no public accountability.  It's not just impacting indigenous peoples, it's a human rights issue for all of us:  students, parents, people of colour and  women, the carriers of life. We must all pay  attention to this.  Indigenous people since the 1970's  have not been sitting back and taking this.  Since the 70's when global groups first  stormed the United Nations and took it by  force, things have not been the same.  No matter where in the world I  travel—to the the South Pacific, Europe or  Africa—I believe that it is indigenous people who are paving the way for social action, for human rights.  It's no coincidence that 80 percent of  the world's wars are on our lands. It's called  "environmental racism." It's a continuing  problem of colonialism. But nowhere—in  no time in history, at least not to my knowledge—have things been so divided between the "haves" and the "have-nots."  When they talk about the number of  millionaires and billionaires cropping up  every new year, [they ignore that] the  number of poor people is growing in leaps  and bounds. In my analysis, we're ail the  "new Indians."  What is really frightening to me, as a  parent, is the future for my children, for our  children. We have not left the world as a  good place for them to inherit.  I had the privilege of being in Seattle  [in November 1999 when thousands of people  protested in the streets against the World Trade  Organization.] I saw leadership from people who said, "we really need to take control of our destination; we really need to  because we have a lot to lose. We're in this  together"  I could talk for a long time about the  impact of western development on many  of our lands. In Canada alone, we have  dozens and dozens of communities—from  the Innu on the East Coast, to the Lubicon  inAlberta, to the clear-cut nations [in British Columbia]—that are facing [governments] that prefer to declare war on our  lands rather than spend money on social  programs.  I don't have too many answers, but I  think the first step is making ourselves  knowledgeable, reading all we can about  what the hell is going on. The second step  is to link up with each other, which is what  I see happening more and more every day.  I edit a magazine called Indigenous  Woman, published by the Indigenous Women's Network. In it, there are stories of the  many projects Indigenous women throughout the globe are organizing—largely  around environmental struggles, land  rights, and care for future children.  Some of you may have known our dear  colleague Ingrid Washinawatok. She was  killed a year ago in defence of the U'wa  Indians in Colombia. [Washinawatok and two  other indigenous rights activists from North  America, Terence Freitas and Laha'e Gay, were  kidnapped and murdered on March 4,1999 by  members of the FARC (the Revolutionary  Armed Forces of Colombia), a leftist guerrilla  organization.]  Two weeks ago—in early February—  U'wa Indians were removed from their  land by the Colombian government to  make way for Occidental Oil (Oxy) to do  more drilling. [The U'wa have been resisting  Oxy's attempts to drill oil in their sacred homeland in the Andean cloud forest since 1988.]  In the evacuation, three young children  were killed.  Ingrid's legacy is a real tribute to our  women and at the same time, we have new  ones coming up.  12 Feature  Resources on genetic engineering and other biocolonial conspiracies:  fifi  Knowledge is power"  compiled by Agnes Huang  Organizations  Basmati Action Group (BAG)  1957 Kitchener Street  Vancouver, BC  V5L 2W6  Contact: Nandita Sharma (604) 255-  4910  E-mail: basmati-action@sfu.ca  BAG is a grassroots organization  that values life in all its diversity and  is against patenting of all life forms.

Feature  from VIRK page 7  people, especially young women, were  often discredited on the witness stand.  Their criminal records were brought  up and though many showed remorse  (some had actually changed their lives), for  the most part, these witnesses were  stripped of their dignity and treated contemptuously by both Crown and defence  counsels.  The defence counsel's explicit suggestion that many of the young witnesses were  liars, combined with the rigorous interrogation they were subjected to, raises issues  regarding fairness of treatment and interrogation. Although the court is bound by  law to facilitate the questioning of young  and vulnerable witnesses, nothing was  done to prevent the abrasive and sometimes brutal interrogations by counsel.  One poignant example of discrediting  young witnesses can be seen in the treatment of GO. She is a young woman of colour who had turned herself in after a warrant was issued for her arrest (she didn't  comply with the subpoena requiring her to  appear as a witness).  GO entered the courtroom wearing  youth detention garb, without shoes. She  was clearly distressed, rocking back and  forth while answering the questions directed to her by counsel. She spoke softly,  often inaudibly, and eventually broke down  crying.  This was in complete contrast to the  presence of Karen Ellard, Kelly Ellard's  step-mother, and her friend Tammy  Brown—both defence witnesses.  These women are white, middle-class  and were well-dressed. Both answered  questions directed at them easily and ap  peared composed on the stand; they spoke  clearly and in a well-articulated tone.  At one point, Warren Glowatski—already convicted for his role in the murder  of Reena Virk—was brought into court  dressed in his own clothes [Glowatski is  appealing his conviction].  In contrast to GO, Glowatski had a  choice whether or not to testify. He chose  not to, citing that his life was in danger. He  now faces a contempt of court charge. Since  he already has a life sentence, even if convicted, Glowatski would not have to serve  any extra time. GO had no choice in testifying, as she had a warrant for her arrest.  The only young people considered  credible were Kelly Ellard, JB—a young  woman whom the defence described as  having turned her life around—and SL, a  young man who worked part-time at a hotel. Working at a hotel, going to college, and  being well-dressed were used as signs of  class and credibility.  Interestingly, Ellard's counsel reminded the jury of the stress that Ellard  experienced in giving testimony. However,  this same stress was never raised as a concern for the Crown witnesses, like GO. In  general, it was the young, working class,  racialized and criminalized witnesses who  were discredited.  Acknowledging this context is extremely relevant when one considers the  sheer range of violence experienced by  young women today. More than half of  Canadian girls and young women have  experienced some form of violence. Add to  this the effects of poverty, race and disability. Statistics reveal that 43 per cent of girls  in foster care have been abused.  In another instance during Ellard's  trial, the Crown asked the defence coun  sel—in advance—to substitute another  counsel when cross-examining a young  woman named CK. CK knew the defence  lawyer from a previous case where he had  represented her mother and associated him  with some extremely traumatic events in  her childhood.  That defence lawyer refused to respect  the request, the Crown neglected to pursue it, and the judge failed to intervene. The  result was that CK had to endure questioning from a man of whom she had vivid  negative associations.  Throughout the trial, the racism behind  Reena Virk's murder was systematically  negated by both defence and Crown counsel.  The Crown's 'common sense' explanation described the teenagers as being bound  by a code of loyalty—a code that made  Ellard and Glowatski ensure that Virk  didn't 'raf on them or the others involved  in the beating.  The defence counsel, who had an  equally one-dimensional explanation, argued that Ellard was innocent and had been  framed by Glowatski and others. Defence  counsel further argued that rather than  Ellard as the murderer, the girl who killed  Virk was none other than the young Black  woman—the only friend Reena had in the  group.  The Crown never put forth the position that violence is about power and dominance, and that the hierarchical relations  within the group were predicated on notions of helonging' and 'power.'  Reena did not belong—she was an outsider who was visibly different—and she  had no power. Her difference, negatively  valued as it was, made her an easy target—  a target that could be erased without fear  of repercussions.  In light of the circumstantial evidence  presented in this case, the perceived lack  of credibility of youth testimonies and the  judge's support of defence counsel's objections and requests, it was surprising that  the jury came up with a guilty verdict.  As observers, our opinion is that this  was a verdict, not a victory. The verdict undoubtedly sent a strong message that violence of this magnitude will not be condoned.  However, the issue of incarcerating  young women continues to haunt us, as  does the reality that there are many other  Reena Virks, Kelly Ellards and Warren  Glowatskis.  More than anything, this case reminds  us once again, how age, race, class, ability  and sexuality intersect to make some girls  and young women more vulnerable to violence than others. Violence is about power  and power is manifested through privilege.  Race, class, and gender were all aspects  that Judge Morrison shared with Kelly  Ellard. To that extent, she was able to relate  to Ellard as another human being, perhaps  even a daughter.  Ellard, however, never related to Reena  Virk as a human being—despite their  commonalities of age and gender.

The government's "get tough" approach is a performance designed to appease racists in Canada who are dismayed  by the movement of Third World peoples.  Although the new Immigration Act  promises to detain those who are smuggled  in and imprison smugglers for life, the government knows that the majority of people  entering Canada without legal documentation will never be discovered. The government is counting on the fact that Third  World peoples will never be able to meet  the highly discriminatory criteria of entry  through official channels.  This is understood by the smugglers,  government and employers—all three of  which benefit enormously from the global  movement of undocumented peoples. The  back door will never be shut down. If it  were, who would serve the First World  masters?  The "get tough" approach is a  smokescreen (a very tangible one for those  who are discovered and incarcerated). It  will ensure that the majority of people entering Canada will continue to do so under highly vulnerable conditions. Bill C-31  will force them further underground. Undocumented people are and will continue  to be dependent upon unscrupulous peoples (employers, smugglers) intent on profiting from their misery. Bill C-31 effectively  criminalizes the essential human quest to  survive. We must recognize this and we  must put a stop to this practice.  What we need to do are two things.  First, we need to create the conditions that  will allow people to live where they choose.  These include  peace, respect  for human  and ecological  diversity, self-  determination  and freedom  from exploitation. Only  these conditions will prevent large-  scale displacement. The Canadian government and  corporations  must take responsibility  for their action  in displacing  millions of  people world  wide.  Secondly,  we need to  completely revision the  space occupied by  Canada. It is a  colonized  space. Canada  is a racist, sexist and classist  space, among other things. This space must  be returned to Indigenous peoples and  those of us who are non-Indigenous must  find a way to live respectfully and peacefully with Indigenous peoples.  We must also realize that the only ones  to have ever  benefitted  from the 500  year global  system of national states  have been  white, capitalist patriarchs  and their supporters. In the  short term, we  must revision  Canadian im-  migra tion  policies to allow for the au-  tonomous  movement of  people. We  must eliminate the borders separating us.  National  states should  not be the arbiter of people's freedom  to move. We  cannot  continue to delimit the definition of'refugee' or 'asylum seeker'. Currently, these definitions include only a small portion of the people  facing violence in the world.  The government's  'get tough'  approach is a  performance  designed to  appease racists  in Canada who are  dismayed by the  movement of  Third World  peoples.  Sponsorship conditions must also be  completely removed. We cannot allow a  two-tier system where sponsored women  are rendered vulnerable to their sponsors  and denied public services. Most women  enter under a "family class" rather than the  "independent class" because their work is  not valued under the 'points' system.  We must ensure that everyone migrating to Canada has an equal status. We cannot continue to force people to enter as indentured labour.  Finally, we cannot allow ourselves to  fall prey to the government's tactic of divide and rule. While the new Immigration  Act opens up immigration for same sex  couples and the sponsorship of children up  to age 22 (from 19), the inherent destruction of Bill C-31 far outweighs the token  gains.  United we must stand against Bill C-  31. We must have a people-centred policy  of migration. The proposed nation-centered  policy excludes most of the world from the  white, capitalist male space of Canada — a  space created at the expense of the dignity  and self-determination of Indigenous peoples, people of colour and women.

Arts  Perpetuating oppression through digital technology:  Click here for oppression  by Heather Millar  CRACKING THE GENDER CODE:  WHO RULES THE WIRED WORLD?  by Melanie Stewart Millar  Second Story Press, Toronto 1998  When I mentioned to a friend that I was  reading a book about the internet magazine  Wired, she vehemently proclaimed that she  hated the magazine.  Apparently she's not alone. In the book  "Cracking the Gender Code: Who Rules the  Wired World?"author Melanie Stewart  Millar deconstructs the slick new image of  the digital world. Using Wired as an example, she recalls a recent event where a large  group of women discussed the internet,  "...[when] asked if they read Wired, they all  raised their hands. And when they were  asked if they hated Wired, they all raised  their hands."  The negative reactions of my friend  and these women parallel my own growing discomfort with the marketing slogans  of Microsoft ("Where do you want to go  today?") and IBM ("Solutions for a small  planet"). In "Cracking the Gender Code,"  Stewart Millar assures me that my discomfort is all too justified. By deconstructing  the world of "digital discourse," Stewart  Millar uncovers the ideas, views, and values that are being sold amidst the drive to  "get online".  Situating her discussion within the  current context of globalization and multinational expansion, Stewart Millar argues  that despite the constant bombardment of  Utopian images proclaiming the dawn of a  new digital revolution, magazines such as  Wired perpetuate racism, sexism, and environmental degradation. Wired effectively  maintains the status quo.  From its birth as a San Francisco-based  print magazine in 1993 to its current success as an "international mini-empire"  (there is an online version of the magazine,  an online newservice, an editorial handbook and a short-lived television show),  Stewart Millar stresses that Wired celebrates, caters to and, in turn, constructs  the needs and desires of the "digital generation".  The average member of this "digital  generation" is white, male and American  with a gross annual income of US$83,000.  It is not surprising, then, that the ideals of  the digital generation find their apex in the  achievements of a "hypermacho man".  This hypermacho man, it seems, is the latest incarnation of the American Cowboy,  fighting the tyrannies of government regulation and blasting away the vestiges of the  messy "natural" world.  In conjunction with the hypermacho  man, Stewart Millar notes the abundance  of "Cyber-femme fatales and Cyber-  barbies" that serve to reinforce gender roles.  Stewart Millar also notes that the severe lack of women of colour images in  Wired issues indicates that "only one quality of difference can be recognized at a  time." Thus race and gender difference is  represented only through images of black  men and white women; the intersection of  race and gender portrayed through images  of women of colour falls out of bounds of  Wired discourse.  Within the supposedly "level"  playing fields of  virtual reality, it  seems, the only  players are white  heterosexual men. Yet  in order to effectively "crack the gender  code," Stewart Millar stresses that it is important to move beyond simply recognizing the racist and sexist images to actually  identifying the systems of oppression that  readers of Wired are encouraged to consume.  In perhaps the strongest chapter of the  book, Stewart Millar makes the connections  between the values of digital culture and  the material effects they have upon our  lives. For example, Wired feature articles  focus on the new technology, interviews  with the 'digital generation,' opinion pieces  on government intervention in technology  and scenarios of Utopian futures. Stewart  Millar argues, Wired generates a world view  that perpetuates not only racism and sexism, but environmental degradation and  western imperialism.  The assertion that technological change  is inevitable, Stewart Millar argues, ensures  that digital culture remains beyond critique. The notion that technology develops  in spite of, rather than due to, human actions relieves internet providers and multinational corporations of their social responsibility.  Perhaps even more chilling, however,  are the intimate connections between the  development of the digital techonology, the  rise of neo-liberalism and the spread of  Western imperialism. Digital technology,  Stewart Millar hints, serves to entrench free-  market liberalism as an essential "right" for  Western "netizens". Namely, it's a "right"  which perpetuates globalization and the  continued exploitation of women and children throughout the South.  Far from advocating social justice,  then, the "digital revolution" enforces and  perpetuates the status quo. As Stewart  Millar stresses, "Wired discourse... is constructing a new (post) human ideal for the  future. It is a vision of digital escape: another in a series of masculine attempts to  gain transcendence through technology.  These are myths that are not going away.  They are myths that we need to resist."  However, it is in envisioning this resistance to the status quo that the book falls  short. In her acknowledgements, Stewart  Millar notes that Cracking the Gender Code  "had it's beginnings in [graduate] research," and despite its catchy titles and  excellent glossary, the book is sometimes  encumbered by an academic format.  Throughout the book Stewart Millar argues that to effectively counter the racist  and sexist effects of digital culture and ideology, feminists need to develop politics  that do not simply react to technological change. Yet despite  her assertion that "feminist  engagement with digital  technology through the  modem must also occur  across race, class and  gender lines," I found it difficult to envision how this  approach might translate  into direct feminist action.  As a result,  Stewart Millar's analysis of digital discourse is  both the beginning and the  end of her resistance; a  move which has much more in common  with "academic feminism" than implied by  her critique of current Western academic  feminism in the earlier chapters of the book.  Moreover, while she acknowledges that  "academic feminist theory makes little effort to politically engage with or communicate a non-academic audience [and] has  frequently represented only the specific interests of upper-middle-class white  women," Stewart Millar consistently fails  to draw upon the material experiences of  women of colour.  By using the experience of a nameless  fifteen-year old on a computer assembly  line "in what has been described as another  world" to illustrate the global effects of  digital technology, Stewart Millar serves to  perpetuate this inequality in her own writing. The overall effect is a sense of theoretical disembodiment. While I am certain  that aspects of digital technology perpetuate racism, sexism, and colonialism, this  is never explained comprehensively in the  book.  Thus while Cracking the Gender Code  encourages me to explore the connections  between digital culture and western imperialism, for example, the tools it provides  me with are primarily theoretical, leaving  me with the task of finding my own material examples.  Despite these difficulties, the book  remains an insightful starting point for  anyone concerned about the effects of the  rise of digital culture and technology.  Cracking the Gender Code has made me revisit my discomfort surrounding  Microsoft's incessant refrain "Where do  you want to go today?" I now recognize  my discomfort for what it is: a feminist resistance to the false promises of the 'digital revolution.'  Heather Millar moonlights as a Kinesis writer  and doesn't own a computer.

V5A1S6  MAY 2000 A Review:  New Thrills, Illicit Delights  video still from  Helpless Maiden  Makes An I Statement  byThirza Cuthand  New Thrills, Illicit Delights: The cultural formation  of queer identity was an art  exhibition of Vancouver's Emily  Carr students. The show was  curated by Kate Barry and held  at the end of March. Although  the exhibition is now over, it  brought some interesting points  to light.  A number of works in the exhibit ostensibly dealt with subverting the 'male gaze'[Editor's  Note: 'male gaze' is used to  describe art created from the  male's viewpoint and which portray women as objects to screen  men's projections]. However,  these attempts fell short of the  goal. For example, in Suzanne  Michele's piece, her photos of  female nudes were unfortunately  the same poses we have been seeing for centuries, in the  Eurocentic classroom, drawing  studios and galleries. The work  seemed to emphasize the mistaken  assumption that if women do what  men do, it automatically results  in something feminist and subversive. Furthering this misconception is the work by  K r i s t e n  Hutchinson. The  so-called  'erotic' images  of women by famous male painters were replicated and used  repeatedly, creating a wallpaper  effect. By doing  so it only served  to reproduced  sexist representations of women,  regardless of the  intent.  Although I applaud these artists' interest in questioning the  male gaze, it would seem to make  far more sense if these women had  learned from the many women artists who have already dealt with  this issue in the 70's and 80's.  It is sad to see women's precious  energy spent re-inventing the  wheel. I also couldn't help wondering what it means when women  refuse to study the art of women  who have come before them, and  turn to men as their frame of ref-  There were a number of pieces  in the show that were refreshing.  Sonja Hebert's lyrical installation "tenacity" dealing with female relations was comprised of  two wooden chairs facing each  other. Long strands of braided hair  flow and grow out of the back rests  coiling towards the opposite  chair, entwining with the other  braid amongst a lake of egg shells.  The piece from afar is lovely,  yet it pulls you in for a more  intimate look at the eggshells and  braids. You almost feel a part of  this circle of intimacy and intricacy. A subtle interplay develops between the precision of  the plaiting and the seeming randomness of the eggshells; between  the strength of the 'ropes' of  hair and the fragility of the  shells.  Hebert says of the piece, "I  have often been in awe of the  ways that women can physically  and emotionally intertwine...  express their love, desire, affection in spite of oppressive  systems, hostile environments and  very little visibility of our experience of sexuality and desire.  Even after our relationships  transform, there often remains a  sense of intimacy and connection."  Thirza Cuthand's, "Helpless  Maiden Makes an I Statement," really worked for me. Any art work  which provides me with a bench to  sit on, and makes me laugh out  loud, gets a lot of points in my  book. Cuthand states that "by using clips of evil queens/witches,  this video plays off the sadomasochistic lesboerotic subtexts  commonly found in children's entertainment. A helpless maiden is  tiring of her consensual s/m relationship with her lover, an  'evil queen'. —This single channel work was inspired by the artist's own childhood 'kiddie porn',  Disney movies which turned her  on to no end and kicked off many  a prepubescent masturbation session." Her juxtaposition of TV  cartoons and sincere new age  psychobabble is hilarious. With  classic doublespeak lines like  "it's not about you being bad;  yes it is about you being bad;  that's not necessarily a negative thing," the fairmaiden, performed by Cuthand, delivers a 6  minute video monologue, from a  dungeon, complete with rat. Simultaneously owning and disowning her feelings, in a familiar  rendition of the overly understanding, mind warps that sometimes masquerade as lesbian relationships.  Heidi Benefiel's "Pandora's  Glasses," and Ki Wight's work  were powerful and effective in  their simplicity. Benefiel's  white fur-covered glasses rest  in a plush velvet case evoking  humour, visual and tactile appeal. As did Wight's six photos  of "hello my name is" stickers  on clothing with quirky titles  such as "Commander Pearly" and  "Wingtip Sally."  Kate Barry's "Tribadism and  Sodomy," and Dorothy Seaton's  "Hole," were problematic. Both  grapple with notions of queer  sex as dirty, in an attempt to  positively reclaim it. For me  it didn't work. Both are well  executed but miss their mark.  Seaton's "Hole" comprises a  beautiful chrysalis constructed  from leaves, suspended above a  chair with a circle of nails in  it. Its perhaps unconscious allusion to pain, rape, and genital mutilation was disturbing,  not empowering. Similarly,  Barry's work does not seem to  reclaim anything. Instead it  bought into notions of lesbians and gays as being soley  defined by what we do with our  genitals. Two white bath towels were beautifully embroidered  with the word "tribadism" on  one and "sodomy" on the other.  Barry suggests the words of  these sexual acts "interrogate  the white cleanliness of bath  towels," which would seem to  reproduce racist overtones.  I found a lot of the work in  the exhibition to be intellectually based and lacking in any  real passion. However, this was  not true of Emma Howes' three  works, which were raw and real.  Her two super life-size drawings, "Introjection" and "Transference" dealt with ideas of  traditional psychiatry, and succeeded in moving beyond them.  From her life-size drawings to  her detailed book of pencil  drawings and words, "New patterns of management," it was  clear that Howes knows what's  going on, and doesn't buy into  it. Her attention to detail drew  me in to turn every page.  Check out this year's Pride  Art exhibit this August, and  the Out on Screen fest, where  you are bound to see some of  these artist's work.  Meg Torwl and kelly haydon may  be the only lesbians left in  the pansexual  art  world. Bulletin Board  Bulletin Board listings have a maximum of 50  >   words.
