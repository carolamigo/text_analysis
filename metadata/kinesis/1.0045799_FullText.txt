Sponsored by the Vancouver  Status of Women (VSW) with support from  the Vancouver Association of Women and the  Law (VAWL), this public forum was an opportunity for anti-porn activists and interested individuals to share information,  experiences and ideas toward strengthening  the anti-pornography fightback.  The forum was timely. Pressure against .  pornographers and their distributers  (most notably Red Hot Video) has steadily  mounted during the past year and shows no  sign of letting up. The most recent  action was BCFW's successful mid-March  picket of the Red Hot Video chain. Plans  for a week long picket of Vancouver's  Main Street store are in the works. People  Against Pornography, one of several local  groups working on the issue, intend to  picket the store from six a.m. to midnight throughout the week May 2 to 9.  Women Against Pornography (WAP) in  Victoria are stepping up their educational  campaign in preparation for the trial of  A Victoria Red Hot Video outlet charged  on three counts of obscenity in late  January. The trial is slated to begin May  9. The group wants to pack the courtroom  and is asking Vancouver women to join  them. (VSW is a contact group in this  city for anyone planning to attend the  proceedings.)  Women attending the forum moved from a  morning spent viewing and analyzing the  range of pornographic images prevalent  throughout society to an afternoon  of discussion on the varied approaches  being used to confront the pornographic  industry. Talks by Debra Lewis and Regina  Lorek, combined with a powerfull slide-  tape presentation on abusive images of  women in both the mass media and pornography, brought the urgency of this issue  home to the women and men attending the  morning session. An abridged version of  Debra's talk on 'Feminist Perspectives on  Pornography' and Regina's talk entitled  'Who is Hurt? Who Benifits?' is provided  in this issue.  The legal avenue, limits to legal controls,  grassroots organizing and community action  strategies were introduced through an .  Legal services slashes budget  Legal Services Society recently announced  a series of drastic cuts planned for its  legal assistance program, made necessary  by the Provincial Government's failure  to provide the $2.4 million promised to  the Society last December for  1983/84.  • Effective April 15, 1983, no one charged  with a summary conviction offence or an  offence under the Juvenile Delinquents  Act will be provided with a lawyer.  • From May 15 to August 15, no lawyers at  all will be appointed to act for people  unable to pay for legal services.  • Effective September 1, all duty counsel  work (lawyers advising accused people  before their first appearance, and speaking to bail on their behalf) will cease.  These cuts are particularly severe for  women. For a three month period there will  be no possibility of getting a lawyer to  act for a woman who is being beaten, who  requires a divorce on the grounds of  cruelty, whose husband is about to abduct  with-children, and so on. These cuts come  on top of the cuts to services made by  the LSS in October 1982, in response to  a directive from the Attorney General.  At that time, virtually all Family  Court assistance was eliminated, and  assistance in Supreme Court was limited  to only the most urgent cases. Financial  eligibility guidelines were reduced and  set at the federal poverty levels, and  user fees were introduced for clients  receiving services - $30 for people not  on social assistance, $10 for those  receiving social assistance.  According to the Legal Services Society,  the numbers of applications for lawyers  in family matters has dropped since the  cuts in October. An LSS spokesperson  explained that this meant that women were  unaware that there was any service at all,  and were going to court on their own to  try to vary maintenance orders, gain  custudy of their children, or get their  husbands to pay arrears on maintenance  orders which had been made in the past.  The Legal Services Society faced a financial crunch last fall, Because of a  dramatic increase in the numbers of people requiring services the Society faced  the possibility of not being able to pay  all of the lawyers appointed. At that time  the Attorney General granted $800,000  towards the 1982/83 fiscal deficit, and  promised to seek a further $2.4 million  from Treasury Board (the body which  approves all Ministry budgets) in 1983/84.  The Attorney General recently advised the  Society that it could not count on the  $2.4 million for 1983/84. At press time  talks were continuing between the Society  and the Attorney General.  afternoon panel session open to women  only.

The network will discuss the ideas and suggestions coming out of the forum and what  the various groups have planned for the  near future.  NAC conference  More than 350 delegates, representing 180  Canadian women's groups, converged on  Ottawa for the 10th annual conference of  the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women.  The score of resolutions passed, ranging  from a call for disarmament to employment strategies to deal with technological change, provide NAC with direction  for action in the upcoming year.  Delegates unanimously called for Canada  to withdraw from, the NATO/NORAD alliance  and the defense production sharing  agreement which forces Canada to increase its military expenditures at the  expense of essential services and jobs.  Moreover, they want Canada to cut its  military budget by 50% and reallocate  the freed resources for social services and economic growth and development.  The resolution also condemned the  Canada/U.S. umbrella agreement to test  arms in Canada and any request to test  arms that would be agreed upon in  secret.  NAC will also call on the Justic Minister .to insist that the ministry  strongly defend the challenge to the  abortion conditions of the Criminal  Code by Joe Borowski, particularly  that any evidence regarding person-  hood beginning at conception be  refuted.  There are 220 member groups in NAC,  representing more than 3 million women.  Women and Sport  One of the issues that is often neglected  by feminists and their organizations is  persistant lack of equal opportunity for  women in sport.  With the help of the  Canadaian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport (CAAW&S) Kinesis  looks at some of the problems still  facing women atheletes and the progress  they have made. See p. 11 - 17.  J 2 Kinesis April 83  MOVEMENT MATTERS  Mothers  together make  hard times better  In 1978 the Federal Advisory Committee on  the Status of Women published statistics  showing that our housework was worth 26 billion or 27% of all the production in this  country. That was five years ago. Our work  is still unpaid. We still do not have the  benefits of other workers: vacation, pensions, sick leave and grievance procedures.  Women have always been told that money is  not available, that other issues are more  important. Today we are told there is a  recession, and cutbacks are necessary. Yet  billions of dollars a year go towards military spending. Monies that could house,  clothe, feed and pay for the services of  women. According to the United Nations Statistics: one years schooling for 16 million  children = one trident submarine; one hydro  'station = one aircraft carrier; 36 three  room apartments = 1 lepard II tank; five  hospitals = one MX Intercontinental Ballistic missle; 28 Kindergartens = one tank  battalion <  r/^  The World Health Organization Statistics  say: the 1982 World budget for defence is  $600 billion (U.S.) for one year, or more  than one million (U.S.) dollars per minute.  All medical research for the world is less  that 20% of all military research money.  Enough money for food, water, education,  health and housing for everyone in the  world has been estimated at 17 billion dollars per year, or as much as the world  spends in arms every two weeks. In Canada,  MacEachan's Budget for military spending  was 5.92 billion for military in 1981-82  and 7.00 billion in 1982-83. By the same  token Medical research for 1981-82 was  $0.1 billion.  Obviously, the money is there, but governments priorities are not with women. Are the  cut backs due to an economic recession, or  are governments foregoing our real needs  in order to prepare for war?  Julia Ward-Howe, an American suffragist,  first began to organize Mother's Day as a  day for women to speak out about their  rights. Mother's Day is now a commercialized day of gifts, cards and token appreciation. In 1975 Wages for Housework organized the first Mother's Day for mothers to  demand money. A group of Vancouver women  together are helping to organize a day to  speak out about our rights, to meet with  other mothers and share our pains, our joys,  and our hopes.  We are having a Mother's Day Celebration to  which you are invited. Bring the children  and supporters in your life. Some of the  groups participating will be Manilla, the  East Indian Women's Association, Matsuri,  the Japanese Canadian Women's Association,  the Family Places; Success, a Chinese Association, and Wages for Housework.  There will be speakers, including Margaret  Mitchell (a local federal MP and a grandmother) , music, demonstrations in self defense and pottery, a clothing sale and  Katari Taiko, a local Japanese drumming  group. Childcare is provided as well as  entertainment for children such as clowns,  puppet chows and face peinting. Come to  your party and enjoy the food and fun and  entertainment at Grandview Park on Commercial Drive between Napier and Williams on  Saturday May 7th from 2 - 5p.m.  If you would like to join us or would like  to set up a booth call Mothers Together  at 255-9841.  PID Support  If you are willing to help women who have  health problems such as chronic illness  and/or disability, please contact the  Vancouver Women's Health Collective. What  is needed is practical help such as shopping, errands, cooking, transportation,  and/or other chores which sick or disabled  women cannot do for themselves.  There are many women in Vancouver who  suffer from chronic health problems who  cannot obtain regular meals and who also  cannot manage to get to necessary appointments for treatments.' Government cutbacks  lessened an already inadequate service  providing in-home care for sick or disabled  women.  When you call the Collective, your name and  the kind of help you are able to provide,  will be recorded and given to women who  call us about this kind of need. Any arrangements will be made between the women  involved.  The PID Support Network is a new group  which will keep in touch by newsletter  and phone. Women with PID are often isolated by illness and the purpose of the  Network is to end this isolation by helping women with PID to contact each other  to share information and support. Our newsletter will contain information about PID  -the latest articles, material about alternate approaches to healing, reports  from women about personal experiences,  tips on local practitioners or clinics  which might be helpful, and so on. We'll  also list the names and phone numbers of  women willing to talk to other women about  PID.  If you would like to be included in the  list, just let us know. Otherwise you'll  receive your newsletter, but your name  and phone number will not be given to anyone. It's up to you. The PID Support Network is being organized by women who have  chronic PID.  If you'd like to help or if you would like  more information, call Mari at 253-5983  (after 11:00a.m.) or the Vancouver Women's  Health Collective at 736-6696. To join  the Network and receive newsletters (we  hope to publish one every three months)  you should send $1.00 to cover postage,  if you can afford this amount - otherwise  just send what you can to M. Wright, 1829  Kitchener Street, Vancouver, V5L 2W5  Fierheller must go  The Vancouver Status of Women has challenged the United Way's persistent attempts to  portray George Fierheller's position on its  Board of Directors as acceptable. Fierheller, who until recently was next in line  for the presidency of the organization, is  also president of First Choice's Premier  Cablesystems, and has repeatedly expressed  his opinion that 'softcore' pornography is  appropriate'entertainment'for Canadian  televicion viewers.  Exposure of Fierheller's connection to the  United Way prompted immediate response  from numberous concerned groups, including  United Way employees. Fierheller submitted  a resignation which was magnanimously  rejected by the Board of Directors. VSW  challenged that decision in a letter to  the Board on March 9 stating: "We are dismayed and outraged to learn that his resignation has recently been rejected by a  majority of Board members. We must question  the integrity of a Board which fails to  recognize a conflict of interest as blatantly obvious as Mr. Fierheller's." The  letter demanded Fierheller be removed  from his position.  His behaviour "is an insult to every woman  struggling to achieve dignity, independence  and respect in a society which, in theory,  protects the human rights of all. It is  in direct conflict with efforts by the  United Way to support organizations which  work towards achieving equality and safety  'for women."  Clayton Shultz, president of the Lower  Mainland United Way, responded saying he  hoped that Fierheller's refusal to be  nominated for the United Way presidency  would allay VSW's concerns. Well no, it  won't.  Pat Feindel, in VSW's reply to Schultz,  states: "We will not feel assured or relieved of our concerns until Mr. Fierheller is no longer sitting on your Board."  The correspondence continues, as VSW and  other groups continue to pressure the  United Way to acknowledge Fierheller's  blatant conflict of interest in representing the organization.  The United Way's annual general meeting  is scheduled for April 28. It is important to send letters to the board letting  them know that you do not want him reelected as a board member. The address is:  Clayton Shultz, United Way of the Lower  Mainland, 1625 W.8th, Van., V6J 1T9. April 83 Kinesis 3  ACROSS CANADA  National  conference  formulates  demands  by Paulette Johnston  The National Association of Women and the  Law (NAWL) held their fifth biennial conference in Victoria at the end of February.  Plenary discussions centered around restructuring NAWL's constitution, and two  of the amendments concerned membership.  As a feminist organization dedicated to  law reform and public information, concern  was expressed regarding the situation that  could arise where anti-choice proponents  could join and sway the votes at decisionmaking time. This has happened to several  hospital boards across the country.  Accordingly, it was decided that an eligible voting member would be defined as one  who had been a member for three months  prior to the convention, and that all members be required to sign a declaration  stating their belief in reproductive freedom of choice.  The subject of the conference was Women in  the Workforce: Affirmative Action and  Parental Benefits. The speakers and the  workshops dispelled the commonly held myth  that these programs cost employers money  and are impossible to implement. As long  as full-time working women continue to earn  only 58 cents compared to every dollar  earned by working men, shared parental  benefits are not feasible. All the speakers  agreed that it is not good enough to state  that the provisions for shared parenting  exist when it is women who are forced by  economics to stay home with the children.  Equal pay for work of equal value must be  fought for, because until women have wage  parity with men, talk of shared parenting  will remain just talk. A delegate from the  Winnipeg caucus made the very valid point  that we as feminists must stop considering -  ourselves lucky when we are in a shared  parenting relationship: we are not lucky,  it is our right to expect that parenting is  no more the job of one parent that it is  the other's.  On the subject of affirmative action,  speakers criticized the government's position that such programs be left to the discretion of individual employers. Shelagh  Day, Director of the Saskatchewan Human  Rights Commission and formerly with B.C.  Human Rights ("always a kamikazee job")  stated that the problem with affirmative  action in Canada is that we're not going  about it right. We're calling just about  everything affirmative action.  She cited the example of the company who  employed handicapped people to do telephone  soliciting for light bulb sales and suddenly wanted to call it an affirmative action  program, and were surprised when the  Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission turned  them down. The U.S. has made a commitment  to end employment discrimination and has  been working to improve and streamline the  procedures used to assist companies in implementing affirmative action programs.  Canada could learn from the U.S. experience.  On other subjects, NAWL members voted:  • to establish a committee to examine the  current federal and provincial laws on  pornography and obscenity and to formulate a legal definition of pornography.  • to lobby provincial and federal governments to endorse and strengthen legislation against pornography.  • that NAWL lobby the Federal government to  assume a more active role in educating  the public on the dehumanizing effect of  pornography on society.  • that all Pay T.V. Companies, as a prerequisite to obtaining a broadcasting  licence, adopt the guidelines established  by the Task Force on Sex-Role Stereotyping in the Broadcast Media.  • that NAWL demand the reinstatement of all  Indian women and their children who wish  to regain their band membership and status rights lost as a result of the discriminating provisions of the Indian Act.  • that NAWL support efforts to establish  government-funded public awareness and  medical education campaigns and screening  centres for persons who may have been exposed to D.E.S. (diethyl-stilbestrol)  prenatally, and that a voluntary registry  of women who took D.E.S. during pregnancy  and their offspring be established and  maintained for the purpose of follow-up  care and treatment of long-term medical  problems.  NAWL plans to take the resolutions that  were passed at the conference and make them  issues in the House. They have had some  success in getting heard and in being acknowledged in the House during the past year  so it is likely that they will continue to  be successful. Hopefully the dedication and  high energy displayed at the conference  will result in real action.  (Paulette Johnston is the Office Co-ordina-  tor for the Port Coquitlam Area Women's  Centre.)

The Rideau Centre - a $250 million shopping, convention centre and hotel complex  that took ten years to complete, includes  the only Eaton store within the city of  Ottawa.  The purpose of the picket was to draw attention to the relationship between the  Eaton family and Playboy programs on First  Choice TV.  The Eaton family owns 80 percent of Glen  Warren Productions Ltd., which, in turn,  owns Baton Broadcasting. Baton Broadcasting  has the contract to produce material for  Playboy programs on First Choice Pay TV.  Dianne Kinnon, a member of the OWFP group,  said the reaction of the shoppers and  pedestrians was positve. "We were surprised at the level of awareness against  pornography," she said.  The women handed out leaflets explaining  the relationship between Eaton's and the  Playboy programs as well as forms for  shoppers to pledge not to shop in the  Eaton stores. The group also prepared a  form letter to Frederick Eaton, president  of the Eaton company, protesting his company's support of pornography.  rapist's sentence from eight years to four  years.  Chief Justice McGillivray seems to think  the woman was partly at fault since she  had gone to the man's home at 3:00 a.m. for  beer and marijuana. He stated that, "...one  might not be too surprised if something  happened under the circumstances."  The woman, who was disabled by polio, was  helpless after the rapist kicked her  crutches away. However, to the judge, consent seemed to be implied because she was  there in the first place.  As there is no appeal planned, it is important for women and women's groups to send  letters of protest to the Alberta Attorney  General, Neil Crawford, 9833 - 109 Street,  Edmonton, Alberta, T5K 2E6.

Since then, the  B.C. Human Rights Commission has held two  press conferences to release three reports  entitled:  "I'm okay, we're not so sure  about you" (on extensions to the Code);  "What this Country did to us, it did to itself" (on farmworkers and domestic workers);  and "How to make it work" (on strengthening  the administration of the code).  "Does anybody really care anymore?" was the  question raised by a reporter at one of the  press conferences in February.  Indeed.  It's clear from the provincial government's  inaction on the issues over the past few  years that they don't put a very high priority on human rights. It's equally clear  that unless women and other affected groups  put a good deal of pressure on, government  indifference will simply shelve these most  recent recommendations.  We can't let them get away with it. While  it is true that there are limitations on  the extent to which human rights legislation  can solve the issues of sexism and discrimination against minority groups, it is also  true that entrenching protection within the  law and tightening up the procedures for  enforcement can provide a defense against  the worst abuses.  The report dealing with extensions to the  Code makes recommendations with respect to  discrimination on the basis of disability,  sex, sexual orientation and age. The following recommendations are those that specifically relate to women:  •The concept of "equal pay for work of  equal value" should be incorporated into  the Human Rights Code.  •Protection against sexual harassment should  be made explicit.  •The sections of the Code dealing with public facilities, accommodation or service;  leasing of property and employment should  be amended to prohibit discrimination on the-  basis of family status (eg. single parent  .  families).  •Tenancy should not be denied because of   '  age, family composition or source of income  (eg. social assistance). i  •The section of the Code outlining restric- ■  tions on employment advertising and request-]  ing information on application forms or at  '  job interviews should be expanded to prohibit enquiries into marital status, family  composition, sex, age, or irrelevant criminal conviction.  •Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be explicitly prohibited.  •The prohibition of discrimination "without  reasonable cause" must be maintained in the  Code, and expanded to provide protection in  the rental of property.  In addition, the Commission recognizes that  the blatant discrimination against women  who are domestic workers must be reversed.  Two sets of problems affect these women. For  those who are live-in workers from other  Who defines "real" discrimination?  by Lorri Rudland and Susan O'Donneli  On February lb, 1983, R. McClelland,  Minister of Labour, refused to appoint a  Board of Inquiry to investigate a charge  of sex discrimination laid by Joy Erickson  against the Chilliwack Golf and Country  Club. McClelland dismissed the recommendation of the Human Rights Branch in favour  of a Board of Inquiry as a "pretty stupid  waste of the taxpayer's money".  The Chilliwack Golf and Country Club requires women to pay a lower membership fee  than the men which becomes a justification  for the prohibition of women from the golf  course between the hours of 7:00 - 10:00  a.m. Saturday mornings, and 7:0Q - 11:00  a.m. Sunday mornings. After the Human  Rights Branch investigated Erickson's complaint, during which time the golf course  refused to alter its discriminatory policies, the Branch recommended to the Minister that a. Board of Inquiry be appointed.  In a report carried by the B.C. Human  Rights Commission newsletter, "...restricted playing times which are based on  the sex of the player run contrary to the  letter and spirit of the human rights  code."  McClelland's trivializing statements were  adopted by newspaper and television reporters who hit new lows in snickering  misogyny. In doing so*, an issue of fundamental importance to women became obscured  and confused.  The question of credibility was not limited to her character, but to the Human  Rights Branch and indirectly to the women's movement. When many of us first  heard of this issue, the preferred course  was disassociation.  Golf, country clubs - who cares? The real  issues are violence against women, unemployment, and so on. But in doing this we  align ourselves with McClelland and the  masses of sneering misogynists who truly  believe women's rights are a laughing matter. The issue is the right to restrict  access by gender.  Would this issue have been treated as such  a laughing matter had women been denied  access to restaurants, shopping malls or  auto repair facilities? What if Jews,  Blacks or Native Indians had been prohibited from the Chilliwack Golf and Country  Club every Saturday and Sunday morning?  The popular justification for restricting  women on weekends is the old - you guessed  it - women stay home and don't work so  they can golf anytime, whereas men work,  all week and require Saturday and Sunday  mornings free. Hmmmmmm...women in the home  don't work? Women don't work outside of the  home (what happened to 45% of the labour  force?).  If the real issue is who works and how  their work is organized, then perhaps golf  courses should require work schedules to  determine visiting rights. But of course  this isn't the real issue.  Sexism is.  McClelland has further stated that his  ministry should "get on with more important  things because there are real cases of discrimination around..." Who defines "real"  discrimination Bob, you or the Human Rights  code passed by the B.C. Legislature? In  April 1976, under a previous Labour Minis-  ster, A Board of Inquiry was appointed to  investigate an identical issue of discrimination by gender on a golf course. The  proprietors of the course settled with the  complainant, altered their discriminatory  policies and issued a public apology.  Joy Erickson is angry and has filed a complaint with the Ombudsman. She wrote the  Minister asking him to give reasons for  his refusal to appoint a Board of Inquiry  and he replied that Ministers are not in  the habit of giving reasons for their decisions. There is clearly no value in a  Human Rights Code when mere mortals are  faced with the absolute powers of a bureaucrat who considers himself above the law  and above explanation.  countries, the lack of secure immigration  status sets them up for a whole range of  abuses - overwork, little time off, sexual  harassment and/or racist remarks from employers, etc. In addition, for these women  and for women who are day household workers, the lack of labour standards protection  makes all domestic workers among the most  exploited groups of workers.  The Commission recommends that domestic  workers who are currently on employment visas and those entering Canada should be given landed immigrant status (although this  issue is under federal jurisdiction), and  that all household workers should be included in provincial labour standards legislation (eg. the Minimum Wage Act, the Hours  of Work Act, etc.)  The third report outlines changes that are  needed to improve the administration and  enforcement of the Code.  Included is a recommendation that the Commission be separated  from the Ministry of Labour and appointed  by the unanimous consent of a committee of  the legislature. Such changes would help to  insure the impartiality of the Commission.  It also proposes that the Commission, rather  than the Minister of Labour, be entrusted  with the decision on whether to appoint a  Board of Inquiry in unresolved complaints.  It must be emphasized again that unless considerable pressure is brought to bear, these  and other recommendations included in the  Commissions's report may wall find themselves simply dropped in the government's  circular file. After all, they have already  managed to totally forget a similar report by  the former Commission.  So change is only  likely to come if all concerned groups mount  a campaign to tell the government that we do  still care.  So what can you do? We simply have to find  as many ways as possible to communicate to  the government that we support the recommendations in the three reports - the extended  coverage of the Code to all groups mentioned;  dealing with health and wage issues for farmworkers and domestic workers; and an altered  structure which would create an independent  Human Rights Code.  Some places to start:  •Write letters - to cabinet ministers, members of the opposition and all members of the  legislature, and especially to Robert McClelland, Minister of Labour; the Premier and  Leader of the Opposition; and your own local  MLA.  •Get support from other organizations in  your community - your women's group, union,  community organization, etc. Make sure that  support is communicated to the government.  •Talk to politicians. Ask them what they  have done about the recommended changes,  where they stand, and whether they are prepared to support changes to the Human Rights  Code this spring. April 83 Kinesis 5  by Alice Earnshaw and Susan O'Donnell  The First Ministers Conference on the constitution, held in Ottawa March 15-16th,  addressed matters directly affecting the  Aboriginal peoples of Canada. In this capacity representatives of Canada's Native  peoples were invited to the conference to  participate in discussions. However, the  people with the negotiating power at the  conference (the Prime Minister and provincial Premiers) represented non-native interests only. No rights of consent nor  veto was given to Native leaders who were  essentially present as supplicants attempting to influence the decision making process; their only power came from their  ability to publicise their cause, and the  facts surrounding it, in the media.  It is no wonder that Indians have called  this situation colonialist. In protest of  this treatment a Coalition of Indian Nations, representing about 70,000 Indians,  has symbolically boycotted the conference  by taking their case directly to the  United Nations.  Three weeks, before the Constitutional Conference the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs  together with I.N.C.A'.R. (International  Committee Against Racism) organized an  ABORIGINAL SUPPORT CONFERENCE at Langara  Campus, Vancouver. Their aim was to increase the awareness of non-Indians as to  the issues around Rights and Title for  Indian peoples in B.C. and to elicit support for their two-pronged struggle against  Provincial and Federal governments.  Louise Mandell, a lawyer with U.B.C.I.C.,  traced the history of the slow throttling  of Aboriginal peoples' power over their  own lands and cultural destiny through a  series of changing Laws and Acts. "Make a  law, break it, and ratify the change with  a new Law, was how to do it. This is cultural genocide performed by slow degrees.  From the Royal Proclamation of 1763, in  which Indian rights were recognized and  confirmed and the Indian peoples referred  to as the "Indian Nations", to the present,  when a few Aboriginal representatives are  invited to take part in discussions in  which non-Indian leaders will decide on the  cultural fate of Native peoples. You are  citizens of Canada, we are your elected  leaders, you have no right to a special  voice in decision making in our Canadian  democracy. These are some of the arguments  that are used to justify this abnegation of  human rights."  Outstanding at this two-day gathering was  the voice of B.C. Indian women bearing witness to the oppression of their people from  the depths of their personal experience:  Marceline: This is why I fight and will  keep on fighting assimilation in any way I  can. "  Two of the women spoke of the notorious  residential schools. Children were sent  away from their families to these schools  to hasten the assimilation process.  Marceline Marceau was nine years old when  her grandfather, under threat of jail,  finally gave her up. Although her grandmother told her that her life would be  easier later if she learned non-Indian ways,  she felt betrayed and bitter against her  family who were also split over this issue.  At the school, no-one tried to understand  her Indians ways. Her long braids were cut  off - the braids that are a special pride  to Indian women. The school seemed like a  prison to her with three hours of lessons  a day and the rest of the time spent in  labour, cleaning the church. When she left  the school she had to relearn her Indian  ways and she vowed then to fight assimilation.  Margaret: "I knew that something was going  Margaret Siwallis, an elder of the Nixalk  Nation, was a carefree kid of seven or  eight when she was sent to a residential  school in 1916 and went through her first  Aboriginal women  Bearing witness to oppression  experience of cultural blindness and  racist treatment. She was beaten with a  five inch leather strap for speaking her  own language. She spoke now in our language  of her fears for the Indian People. Her  last words to us were "I do not know what  the future will hold, but I pray that the  Creator will be kind to the Indian people."  Ancie: "Our children are precious to us.  Forty-one children were taken from our  community in 1965."  Ancle became a mother at 14 years and both  she and her child were apprehended. She  became a foster child of non-Indians. Her  child was taken from her and she was badgered into signing adoption papers on the  promise of future contact. She has never  seen that child. She was forbidden to return to Lil'wat, her home. She was sent to  public school, considered below average  and refused permission to train as a nurse.  But she knew she was not stupid and she  felt brainwashed. She was bitter and angry.  Finally she was able to return to Mount  Currie, became involved with a group of  women who were to become the "Concerned  Aboriginal Women" and slowly began to regain her identity, self-respect and cultural pride.  Marie-Louise: "People have been surprised  that it is we women who do these things.  But who else is there to do it?"  The most telling story of personal and  communal political struggle came from  Marie-Louise Williams, a leading force in  "Concerned Aboriginal Women", a group of  B.C. Indian women actively engaged in the  ongoing struggle against assimilation.  Marie-Louise has been through the residential school system and "made it" to become  an "educated Indian". But one thing she  hasn't become is assimilated I Now a mother  of nine children she has the energy and  sense of purpose to wage a ten-year battle  with D.I.A. (Department of Indian Affairs)  to have a Band school for her'community,  run by Indians for Indians.  "Nothing can be done without that D.I.A.  stamp and alciost everything is only done  after outside experts assess the situation."  Finally the school plans were approved but  then expanded by D.I.A. to become a subdivision for 100 houses. They were to be  built by outside contractors with outside  labour, of course. Marie-Louise recounts  another struggle to get the funding approved on a vote which would allow the  Band to be involved in the construction,  and then a further struggle to get "approved" training for Band members in the  requisite skills. But this will not be the  end of the perpetual 'catch 22' that is  D.I.A. bearuocracy: A maze of rules and  regulations designed to prevent the  Indians (for their own good) from making  their own mistakes.  THE FIRST MINISTERS CONFERENCE  The conference agenda included possible  alterations to the wording of Section 35  which deals with Aboriginal rights and  title. This section is of vital importance  to Canada's Native peoples. The definition  and interpretation of the terms RIGHTS and  TITLE will ultimately determine Native  peoples' power to take control of their  own cultural destiny.  The government of British Columbia would  like to see all mention of Aboriginal  Rights and Title removed from.the constitution as this would make Indian Nations  really vulnerable in negotiations on land  claims. But for Aboriginal peoples the  land is indeed the culture, as well as  providing a potential escape from paternalistic economic domination by government.  Aboriginal leaders want to see rights and  title entrenched in the constitution; ongoing discussion to define and interpret  the terms and most important,; a CONSENT  CLAUSE, which would require their consent  to changes in the consititution affecting  their future.  The issue of equality of rights of male  and female Aboriginal persons was a key  topic on the conference agenda. After very  long discussion an accord was reached on  this issue. The following wording now appears in the Constitutional Accord: "Notwithstanding any other provision of this  Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in sub-section (1) are guaranteed  equally to male and female persons."  At last non-Indian feminists who have argued so vehemently and so long for the retention of status rights for Indian women  who marry non-status men can breathe a  sigh of relief. Or can they? No so fast!  As agreed around the conference table, the  wording of this clause mentioned "...rights  of aboriginal peoples are guaranteed equally  to male and female persons." After the  Aboriginal participants had left the conference the wording was changed. The new  wording conveniently allows the Federal  government to ignore any claims to status  by persons currently defined by them as  non-status or as Metis.  This leaves Indian women who have lost  their status exactly where they were. Such  a dishonest manoeuver would have been less  easily possible if a Consent Clause were  in place. 6 Kinesis April 83  April 83 Kinesis 7  PORNOGRAPHY  PORNOGRAPHY: a  Misogyny, Pornography  and Violence Against Women  by Debra Lewis  The following is an abridged version of  Debra's presentation to the Pornography  Forum, March 20.  Debra is currently  working for Battered Women 's Support  Services and co-authored Rape: The Price  of Coercive Sexuality.  theme in our culture. It is all pervasive,  manifesting itself in extreme forms encountered by us in the systematic violence  against women and in the more subtle forms  of manipulation, ridicule and every day discounting of women as full human beings.  I want to address several themes which will  begin to show why misogyny and violence  exist.  Rape, property and sexual bargaining  The factors which determine how rape cases  are treated by the Criminal Justice System  are almost exclusively those related to the  victim herself (such as age, marital status  and occupation), or those factors related  to the offense that cast a certain light on  her (for example, women who are raped in the  offender's residence are less likely to be  successful in having their cases investigated and prosecuted than those raped in their  own homes).  The operation of the law, then, tells us  two things. First, it says that it is those  victims that are most clearly dependent on  a male "owner" who are considered worthy  of the protection of the state. Second, because as property we do not own ourselves,  we are expected not to take risks which result in our being raped.  If our sexuality and reproductivity.are seen  to be our prime value, and if the rightful  owner of that value is not ourselves but  men, then we are expected not to take risks  with our sexuality, we are expected to abide  by the rules. Risk, however, is often defined retroactively. If we are in a situation  where we are raped, then we probably have  taken a risk that we should not have taken,**  unless we have been in our own homes or  other equally respectable places. Ironically,  our homes are often not the safest place for  us to be, as evidenced by the incidence of  wife battering, sexual abuse and incest that  often occur there.  The status of women as property has its origins in the rise of private property itself.  As private property emerged, there emerged  with it the need for a mechanism through  which it could be transferred from one generation to the next. Because men were the  holders of both initial and subsequent forms  of accumulated private property, it was men  who required a determinate heir on whom to  bestow family assets. It is obviously quite  easy, from a biological point of view, to  determine who one's mother is. However, in  The women's movement has  provided a clear threat to  patriarchial relations. The  increase both in quantity  and coercive quality of  pornography is correlated to  this threat.  the absence of stringent social mechanisms,  paternity is by no means assured. Women became forns of property because ownership is  the most efficient means of control. And as  property, our value was determined exclusively by our sexual and reproductive capacities.  However, our status as men's property is a  key factor in creating the resentments that  men hold against women. Despite the fact  that the property relation was created by  men in their own interests, as individuals  they frequently do not wish to pay the price  necessary for access to female sexual property. Since we, as women, do not own our  sexuality, we not only are prohibited from  taking risks which result in rape, we are  equally prohibited from using our sexuality  purely in accordance with our own desires.  What emerges from this is a situation of  sexual bargaining. Women must preserve our  only value, that is our sexual value, in  order to make the best possible trade on the  market. We trade for future financial, social, emotional, and sexual security. In  such a bargain, a woman must give out her  trust carefully in the hope that it will go  to its rightful owner or that, in the event  a mistake is made, the loss will be sufficiently small that the future owner either  won't notice or won't mind.  An important factor in misogyny is that men  come to resent and dislike women because we  are seen as having something they want and  have a right to, but we are unwilling to  give freely. Further, because men and women  do not enter the bargaining process from  positions of equality, men frequently have  the opportunity to transform feelings of  resentment into concrete action. For this  reason, all sexual exchanges between men and  women are potentially coercive, and many  are in fact so.  Violence and social control  There is a second aspect of violence against  women and generalized woman-hatred, one that  builds on and extends our status as property  Violence against women is not only systematic and based on the property relation between women and men, it is also a fundamental tool of social control which insures  the continuation of all forms of exploitation based on sex. In this sense, violence  against women is a crucial part of the state  apparatus designed to maintain patriarchal  relations. By 'state', I mean not only government, but the entire system of institutions which are designed to maintain the  status quo. These include ideological institutions such as education and the media and  coercive institutions such as the police  and courts.  This form of violence is particularly insidious and difficult to analyze because as  women the violence we face frequently comes  from those we are taught to trust, on whom  we are emotionally and economically dependent, and with whom we are intimately  involved.  Theoreticians (and, in particular, orthodox  Marxists) have long accepted the role of  violence in maintaining exploitive relations  based on class or race. Even when violence  is not present in overt forms, its threat is  frequently sufficient to maintain social  order. Seldom, however, has the role of violence against women been seen as a similarly  crucial component in sustaining patriarchal  relations. It is either portrayed as a series of individual acts, or as merely an accidental or coincidental (albeit unfortunate)  corollary of sexism. I would suggest that  such an approach is both naive and anti-  materialist. It certainly distorts the impact of the use or threat of violence on the  day to day lives of women.  Pornography - an ideological componant of  violence and the social control of women  Pornography and the intrinsic connection  between violence and sexuality which it contains, is the ideological arm of violence  against women. It plays a role in sustaining  a system in which women are acceptable tar- |  gets of violence and other forms of misogyny  Further, I'd suggest that the widespread  existence of violent pornography has a he-  gmonic impact on women. It affects not only  how men see and act toward women, but also  how we as women see ourselves and our relationship to the world.  First, it reinforces for us that violence  and coercion should be accepted parts of  our lives. Further, if we reject the link-  PORNOGRAPHY  Feminist Analysis  age of sexuality and violence, we are open  to charges of being "prudish" or "moralistic". The fact that it has taken many of us  so long to take on the issue of pornography  is one indication of how insidious that  linkage is.  In addition, pornography frequently provides  us with a clear warning of what may happen  to us if we refuse to accept traditional  female roles. Women who do not accept their  status as the property of men may be subjected to public as well as personal violence. From this perspective, I do not find  it surprising that there has been a drastic  increase in violent and coercive pornography in the past ten years. The women's movement has provided a clear challenge and  threat to patriarchal relations. The increase both in the quantity and coercive  quality of pornography is correlated to this  threat.  Recognizing the role that pornography plays  is frightening, terrifying. It is terrifying because it becomes clear that the rapid  increase in pornography is an integral part  of a political system that can only be described as sexual fascism. I do not use the  word fascism lightly, or merely for its  shock value. I use it because it is the  only way to describe the kind of terrorism  that pornography promotes.  It is also true that many of the themes of  sexual fascism and conventional fascism are  virtually interchangeable. An article by  Dorchen Liedholdt in the most recent (March  15) issue of WIN magazine asks the reader  to visualize two pictures:  "In the first, a cartoon, a man and a woman  stand on a sidewalk. He is thin and wears  a yarmiilke. She is fat'and carries a pocket-  book with a large lock on it. Behind the  couple, in the background, is a Jewish ghetto. Running on the sidewalk, toward the  foreground of the picture, is an angular  little girl. Like the man and woman, she  has a grotesquely exaggerated nose. She is  chasing a dollar bill attached to a string  pulled by a man crouched behind a building.  The man wears a swastika on his right arm  and raises a baseball bat over his head  with the left one.  In the second picture, a naked woman leans  back against a draped counter. Her pelvis  is thrust forward and her arms are behind  her back as though her wrists were tied.  Her legs are slightly spread. Her posture  suggests helplessness, submission and sex  ual desire. She looks at the viewer seductively. Her face is devoid of emotion or  intelligence. Circling her leg, penetrating  her thighs, arid coiling behind her is a  gleaming, monstrous python."  The first, anti-semitic picture is a cartoon from Hustler, North America's third  largest pornographic magazine. The second  is a typical pornographic painting by Franz  von Stuck, Adolf Hitler's favourite artist.  Leidholdt's article also documents the similarities between the psychology of fascism  and the psychology of the sexual fascism of  pornography. Both aire based on an ideology  of biological determinism - the idea that  one race or one sex is born superior. Both  institutionalize a cult of dehumanization,  rigid hierarchy, racism and sadomasochism.  And ultimately, both contain the seeds of  mass violence.  The article closes with reference to the  death of Dorothy Stratton, Playboy's Playmate of the year in 1980 who was brutally  murdered by her pimp-like husband Paul  Snider. Stratton's death was described by  the press as the work of a maniac, a madman. What was.seldom recognized is that the  madness was not that of an individual, but  of an entire culture.  Understanding sexual fascism's goal of dehumanizing and, in it's extreme form, destroying women makes the pieces of pornography's puzzle fit together. From snuff  movies and torture scenes to airbrushed  plastic centrefolds to the pornographic and  stereotyped images of women in other media   tjjl  forms - all of these are part of a continu-   m  um which reflects the range of violent,  coercive and exploitive behaviours that are  directed toward women daily. And because  sexual fascism is so all pervasive, our  strategies for fighting it must necessarily  be varied and complex. Our ultimate goal is  to work toward a revolution that will overthrow sexual fascism.  To close, I want to return to a passage  from Liedholdt's article:  "As surely as  the preconditions for world obliteration  exist in the mentality that stockpiles nuclear weapons in the interest of security,  so the preconditions for genocide and cyno-  cide reside within the collective mind that  dehumanizes others in order to affirm its  own humanity. And once we understand how  that mind works, it is up to us to change  it."  Pornography: The Legal Fight  by Jancis Andrews  Jancis is an active member of the North  Shore Women's Centre, she provided the  Pornography Forum with a presentation on  the current strategies being used in regard to the legal system. Her remarks  appear here in an abridged form.  Legal language is dry, formal and remote,  masking the real-life tragedies and horrors  to which that legal language is attached.  This is no different with Section 159 of  the Criminal Code, the obscenity section,  which purports to deal with, in the remote  language of the law, "offences tending to  corrupt morals."  The great majority of people have not read  for themselves this particular section,  but possess a vague belief that it deals  with the banning of so-called dirty books  and pictures. Section 159 states, "everyone commits an offence who makes, prints,  publishes, distributes, circulates, or has  in his possession for the purpose of circulation, any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other  thing whatsoever; the term obscene being  defined as "the undue exploitation of sex,  or of sex and...crime, horror, cruelty and  violence such as would offend community  standards."  This is further defined by the B.C. Guidelines Governing Pornography, which state  that the following categories of obscenity  are considered to have clearly contravened  continued on p. 8  The Victoria WAP (Women Against  Pornography) display at the  March 20 forum encouraged women  to confront the violence and  racism of pornographic imagery  that assault us all. The display  included several panels of images  as well as a table of hard-core  porn magazines. We can't fight  it if we won't see it. 8 Kinesis April 83  PORNOGRAPHY  PORN: WHO'S HURT?   WHO BENEFITS?  by Regina Lorek  Regina Lorek is a member of Vancouver  Rape Relief and BCFW's Committee to Stop  Red Hot Video.  She is one of the women  who has   been busy screening the hardcore pornography tapes turned over to  BCFW   in early December by Pacific Video-  Regina's talk at the March 20 pornography  forum reflected her first-hand knowleddge  of porn imagery. Due to space,  the full  range of her remarks could not be printed.  This is a partial rendering of her speech.  Mercenary prostitution, the selling of a  woman's body, originated in ancient Athens  in approximately 594 B.C. as a government-  run enterprise to finance the building of  the Greek military.  The 'pornobosceions' who ran these brothels  are our present day pornographers. Pornography means the writing or depiction of  subjugated women. Subjugated means owing  obedience or loyalty. Government licensed  brothels still exist. The military still  needs prostitutes. Pornographers are still  raking in the profits.  All that has changed is that technology has  altered some of the profit margins of prostitution and pornography. If a man owns a  woman as a prostitute, she can only produce  profits from five, eight or maybe ten men  per night. If a man owns a woman, and puts  her in a movie, his profit is greatly multiplied.  Pornography has always made me uncomfortable. I have feared it, loathed it, sometimes been afraid of it. And have hated myself because at times it has turned me on.  I was afraid that my lover would want me to  be like the women in pornography, afraid  that I wasn't...afraid that I was. I was  angry that so many men had access to these  women's bodies for as little as $1.50; angry  at the men who undressed me with their eyes;  angry at my lover who fantasized the woman  on page thirty-nine when he was in bed with  me. I was fascinated with the variety of  vaginas, the different sizes and shapes of  breasts and bums.  At sixteen I answered an ad for a photographer's model, I walked into the room, the  door clicked shut, locked... there were three  more men in the room than when I had entered. They told me to take off my clothes. I  did, and they took pictures.  In later years when I fought with the man I  lived with who brought pornography home all  of these confusing feelings and thoughts  came out as "get it out of here - now", or  "I don't want you jacking off to that  stuff". Nothing more complex than that.  I've worked at Vancouver Rape Relief for  three and a half years now and have talked  to a lot of women. I've spent the last six  months as a member of B.C.F.W., deliberately1  looking at the pornography I have avoided  for years.  I have been scared by some of the pornography I have seen, bored by some, amused  by some, horrified by some, turned on by  some and angered by lots. I have been walking around in a state of rage. I went home  to my friend and lover, and fought with him  H&1S&& continued next page  I went home to my lover,  demanding he and I prove  right here in this bed that  pornography does lie about  my sexuality.

(2) Material which depicts bestiality and (3) Material involving juveniles  in sexual activities, violence not being  a factor to be considered in this last  context. Explicit depiction of incest,  for some unknown reason, is not  included  in these Guidelines.  The philosophy of violent hardcore films  encompasses a spectrum ranging from rape  viewed as joke - through rape viewed as  spectator sport - to rape viewed as a  necessary measure in order to teach women  their place: sheer brutal misogyny that  without question contravenes many times  over, both Section 159, and the B.C.  Guidelines Governing Pornography.  Because the law had been so clearly contravened, many people were confident way  back in June 1982, that charges would be  laid and prosecutions undertaken. We were  wrong.  We were told no prosecutions would take  place, because prosecutions were expensive  (ignoring the fact that all prosecutions  are expensive, but are not withheld on that  account); that the courts were crowded and  it would be at least five months before a  case could come to court (ignoring the fact  that some cases take over a year to come to  court, but prosecutions are not withheld  on that Account); that Crown Counsels had  had difficulty proving obscenity in the  sixties, and were not about to go through  that again, (ignoring the fact that the  three pubic hairs put out by Playboy twenty  years ago bore no relation whatsoever to  the explicit rape and torture scenes we had  seen).  As our dismay and anger mounted, and the  passing months brought forth no action from  our policing authorities, citizens, led by  the British Columbia Federation of Women,  were forced to take to the streets to protest, while a coalition of 42 women's  groups, led by the N.S.W.C, were forced  to complain to the Ombudsman that their  rights as taxpayers and citizens were not  being upheld.  Eventually, Attorney General Allan Williams  could ignore the uproar no longer and  moved against Red Hot Video and others on  January 7th. The first trial of Red Hot  Video will take place in Victoria, between  May 9th and 20th and will undoubtedly prove  a test case, for we have been informed that  British Columbia has the dubious honour of  being the first province where explicit  rape films are widely available, and we  will be the crucible wherein standards will  be set for the rest of the country. In the  meantime!, our complaint about the X Rated  Movie Handbook has been passed by Justice  Minister Mark McGuigan to Pierre Boussieres  the Minister of National Revenue, who has  charge of Customs. We are still waiting to  hear from him on the matter.  As our anger mounted and  the passing months brought  no action from our policing  authority, citizens were  forced to take to the streets  in protest.  Although charges have been laid, our battle  continues. In the legal area, there are  surfacing four major movements. (1) To have  Section 159 strengthened and clarified.  (2) To have the Broadcasting Act changed.  (3) To have pornography included in Section  281 of the Criminal Code, the hate propaganda section, in that it is misogyny,  using videotape as its medium, aimed at a  specific group, and (4) that the B.C. Human  Rights Code also be brought up to date in  order to reflect that latter truth.  The great drawback of Section 159 is that  it comes to us still clothed in its Victorian mentality, which lumps all sexual ac  tivity together under the term "obscene",  which is absurd. This declares that the  act of sexual love, between two consenting  adults who celebrate each other as equals  and whose main delight is to give delight  to the other, in other words, "erotica", ,,  equals the act of sexual violence where  one person has been coerced, tricked or  beaten into sexual activity with one or  more persons, in other words, pornography.  There is no way that erotica equals pornography. Women examining the Code will be  suggesting to the Law Reform Commission thatl  the term obscenity be dropped, and the terms  erotica and pornography used instead, with  the difference made crystal clear. It is  being suggested that erotica should not be  considered to contravene the law; nor  should bona fide medical documentaries on .  sexual concerns; but that pornography and  explicit incest films should.  Changes to the Broadcasting Act have been  suggested by MP Lynn McDonald of Toronto  because of the forked tongue decision of  the CRTC to grant a licence to First Choice  Playboy Channel, inspite of their having  promised to work to eliminate sexism in  Canadian media. She has suggested that the  simple phrase "or sex" be added to that  section of the Broadcasting Act that forbids discrimination against minority groups  That brings us to the hate propaganda issue.  Language and pictorial images are the means  by which we communicate, by which we pass  down our culture from generation to generation. They can be used to invoke love or  to invoke hate: they are therefore of paramount importance. When, as in hardcore  films, the female is referred to not by  name, which would express her wholeness  and her humanity, but by those parts of the  body or those bodily functions which in our  culture are traditionally used as obseni-  ties, then the woman's wholeness is reduced  and scattered, her humanity obliterated.  We are therefore demanding of the Law Reform Commission that Section 281.2, subsection 2, the hate propaganda section in  its definition of "identifiable group"  which at present means "any section of the  public distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin only," have that  magic little phrase "or sex" included •■ April 83 Kinesis 9  PORNOGRAPHY  harder than I ever have, demanding that he  and I prove right now - right here in this  bed - that pornography does lie about my  sexuality and oh, please, let it be true  that pornography also lies about his. But  it's not that simple. Sometimes it does,  and sometimes it doesn't.  In the work I have been doing against pornography so far I have found that moral  judgments get in the way, that generalizations are dangerous and that both of these  lead to over simplifications.  We need to build our analysis, education,  and stratagies on what exists right now.  Pornography in context  Pornography does not exist in a vacuum.  We do not yet have control over our bodies.  We are still fighting for the right to  abortion, an end to forced sterilization,  the right to love whom we choose...women  or men, an end to sexual harassment on the  job, equal pay, the right to birth our  babies the way we choose and the right for  free 24 hour childcare.  We are still being raped, beaten, and  forced into sexual practises that we do not  choose. We are still forced into sexual  slavery. The men who sell pictures of us in  chains, tell us that this is what we really  want, that beneath our protests of modesty  burns a tigress - a vile man-eating woman.  They suggest that all it takes is penetration in any orifice by any masterful man  and we are sexually beserk, totally indiscriminate, ready to fuck anything, anytime.  Pornography does a nice job of both denying our humanity, and defining and controlling our sexuality. After all these years,  all this exposure to pornography, all the  reading, crying, raging and fighting, all  the agonising about whether or not I am  a puritan or a pervert, I still say: Get  rid of pornography. I still don't want  men jacking off to this stuff. I don't  want men to imagine that their ejaculation  is sacred, and that they not only can, but  must use anything, or anybody (usually female) or any amount of force or coercion,  to achieve it.  If you haven't seen any pornography lately  you might be surprised at how the content  has changed over the past twenty years. In  B.C.F.W., we have been viewing some of the  52 tapes handed over to us by a store owner in Richmond, who bought the tapes from  Red Hot Video on Main street. We have  noticed quite a difference between recent  pornography and what was available in the  60's. The earlier tapes often showed women  in control during sex. They portrayed lit- -  tie violence,some humour, some conversation,  even sometimes a relationship between a  woman and a man. In the 70's, there is  more violence in these films...more rape,  lots of anal sex, anal rape, no conversation apart from "you love it, don't you?"  The recent 80's pornography concentrates  on bondage, studded collars, manacles,  foam balls that keep the screams down,  chains that go around the breast, and pliers that pinch the nipples. There is also  a lot more rape, but the woman is always  portrayed as loving it in the end. There is  more oral and anal sex, more depiction of  women participating in the humiliation of  other women, and much more ejaculation  into women's faces. I think what happened  in pornography while we weren't looking  goes something like this: After they solved  the depression by sending the boys off to  conquer each other we (women that is) ran  the country. After World War II, the men in  power campaigned very hard to get us out of  the jobs we,had, and back home to repopulate  the white race. In the sixties we got the  pill. The sexual revolution was not much of  a revolution for us at all. We were pressured to be sexually accessible at all times,  men didn't have to worry about us getting  pregnant, and they still defined the terms  of when and how we would be sexual.  Men no longer have to create  their own fantasies, the  pornographers do it for  them. And pornography  teaches men that their  fantasies are possible, that  they can conquer women.  Now that they didn't want us to produce  babies, they got worried about what we'd do  with all that sexual energy. In pornography,  they built a version of us as sexually beserk. In their minds we were depraved, indiscriminate, and they even imagined us begging for pain. In the minds of men, abusing  and torturing women became more acceptable,  and maybe even necessary, as a way to control our sexuality.  The other half of this is the re-emergence  of the Women's Liberation Movement as a  force to be reckoned with. As we got more  and more vocal, in larger and larger numbers,  we became more powerful, and therefore more  threatening. Men made more and more violent  pornography, and they imagined that force  or the threat of force would keep us under  control. The women in the porn appeared  younger and younger; children have less  power than grown women.  The pornographers and the moralists have  always assigned us to either the virgin or  the whore roles. In current pornography  children often take over the role of the  virgin. The scenes are the same. Innocent  child, pre-pubescent or pubescent, with a  smoldering sexuality, just waiting for  Daddy or any other man to let it loose by  penetration in any orifice. For him there  is the thrill of being the first man to  "have" her and of course she'll never forget her "first".  The pornographers are absolutely right  about that. I have worked with women who  were raped by their fathers as children or  teenagers and now they are in their 20's or  30's or 40's, and they still haven't forgotten the terror. Some of them have still  not been able to get the photographs their  fathers made. One of them takes a razor to  her thighs regularly to eliminate the body  memory of her father's touch.  Stereotypes  Some of the pornography I've seen is very  racist. In Filthy Rich, there is a female  Cuban cook who performs sexual acts with  food and whose main interest is to fuck  anything, anytime. She is also aggressive  and in control quite often. The punishment  for this is violent rape by two white  bikers. Again and again we have pictures  of black men with three foot penises, black  women in leather. They are tough, man swallowing, and they can take anything. These  are the same ideas slave holders had.  A lot of the pornography I've seen portrays  some very stereotypical images of the poor  and the rich. The poor smell and have bad  teeth, but they sure do know how to fuck.  Rich women are cold, frigid, manipulators  who need to be taught a lesson or who use  their money and position to get laid.  Who are the profiteers?  David Stovemen, the registered owner of the  Main Street Red Hot Video Store, makes a  300% profit on the tapes he sells, and over  400% profit on rentals.  Peter Struk, a distributor to Red Hot Video,  buys tapes at $8.00 and sells copies at  $16.00. When his house was raided twenty-  one video machines and hundreds of tapes  were confiscated.  But the lion's share of the profits are  made by the producers.  Did you know that the porn industry is  larger than the conventional film and record  industries combined?; or that there are  four times as many porn shops in the United  States as there are McDonalds Restaurants?  Did you know that there are 260 different  periodicals in the United States devoted to  child pornography?  Pornography as violence  It is estimated that 50% of pornography  depicts violence against women or children.  Of the 50% that does not contain violence,  some scenes in pornography movies are funny.  some appear consensual. What they usually  do in the movies is soften you up with one  of the funny or consensual scenes, and then  throw in a little violence later. It makes  the violence more acceptable, and leaves  you with a lot of confused feelings.  Most of the violence done to women is not  done in the making of pictures or movies.  It is done by men who rape women, men who  pressure women into sexual acts as a result  of pornography, and men who less and less  frequently see rape as aberrant anti-social  behavior. I'm sure some men are encouraged  to rape by watching or using pornography.  A recent news story from Boston reported  that four men gang raped a woman in a bar  while twelve other men stood around and  watched and cheered. I can't prove that  these men behaved in this way directly as  a result of pornography, but I do know that  the scene I just described occurs a lot in  pornography. Men no longer have to create  their own fantasies, the'pornographers do  it for them. And pornography teaches men  that their fantasies are possible; it convinces them that they can conquer all women,  Pornography certainly makes violence against  women acceptable by depicting women as deserving of rape or as wanting to be raped.  But let us not forget that it is men who  rape women.  But isn't pornography just as degrading for  men? NO. I and many other feminists don't  think so.  Men competing with each other for how many  times they can get it up, or how many women  they can fuck without talking or feeling or  thinking contributes to the emotional dead-  ing of men. It makes them suitable for their  role as our oppressors. And I'm sure that  role, that deadening, is often lonely and  painful. But it does not compare to having  two men ejaculate into your face for the  benefit of the camera, the pornographers.  and the men who buy it, even if they are  lonely and in pain.  Men's feelings are important but there are  several other things that must come first.  Men must stop their violent, abusive and  coercive behaviour towards women. Then convince other men to do the same. It is with  those men that feelings can be worked  through.  Men must share with women their money and  time to free us up to fight for our liberation. Then, maybe then, we'll have a chance  to prove that pornography is not only lies  about women, but also about men. We can  prove it in our beds, across our kitchen  tables and on our picket lines.  My aim in fighting pornography is to end  male domination. That is not the government's aim. The government will accommodate  a few reforms but certainly nothing to  threaten the existing balance of power.  I don't think women need much convincing  about the dangers of pornography. What we  need is action.  We need strategies that include humour and  imagination. Strategies that mock pornographers and shame men who buy the materials.  Strategies that we can implement in ones  and twos, and in hundreds. 10 Kinesis April 83  Julie Belmas and Ann Hansen await trial  by Claudia MacDonald  In mid-March, Kinesis interviewed Ann  Hansen and Julie Belmas who are being held  at Lakeside, the women's unit at the Lower  Mainland Regional Correctional Institute,  on charges which include the fire-bombings  of Red Hot Video pronography outlets in  late November '82; the sabotage of the  B.C. Hydro Cheekeye-Dunsmuir hydro substation in June '82; possession of restricted weapons and several counts of conspiracy relating to alleged plans for future  illicit activities. Three men were also  charged.  The commercial media, assisted by police  sources, sensationalized the case, publishing potential evidence and unfounded speculations as well as exploiting personal  details of their lives in an attempt to  cast them in the role of "terrorists" and  "extremists" belonging to an international  network of "anarchist cells".  Many individuals and groups active in the  Vancouver community were quick to respond,  not only to the media coverage but also  to the actions of the police. Press statements were issued, some rejecting the  notion that the arrested were "terrorists",  others condemning the increased police  harassment of people working peacefully  for social and political change or reaffirming their commitment to the issues  surrounding the charges.  On March 1, '83 the accused were refused  bail on the grounds that they represented  too great a danger to the community. Although Ann and Julie were not surprised,  they thought it ironic that, at the hearing  which directly proceeded their own, three  men accused of gang-rape were set free on  bail in the vicinity of $1,000.  Kinesis spoke with several of Ann and  Julie's friends and co-workers who were  appalled to see their personalities so  distorted by the media. A long time friend  of Ann's said that he felt he had been  "witness to a lynching". A Vancouver  feminist who has worked with her in Women  Against Prisons said, "When I remember  talking with Ann about things which matter  to us all, the health and safety and survival of our planet, it's absurd, unreal to  portray her as a 'terrorist'."  Ann's roots are in rural Ontario, where  she grew up on a farm and as an adult  lived in an alternative farming commune.  She studied history and political science  in the progressive Integrated Studies  Program at the University of Waterloo, and  later moved to Toronto where she wrote for  the Toronto Clarion and worked on the  Bulldozer, which publishes writings by  prisoners. Close friends and women who  have worked with Ann in groups describe  her as an optimistic, reliable, hardworking woman with a good sense of humour,  around whom it is impossible to be depressed.  A native of Vancouver, Julie traces the  roots of her political consciousness to  her involvement in the high school punk  scene, which she says was at that time a  politically aware, unifed working class  youth movement involved in such events as  Rock Against Racism, where punk women had  tipsir own identity and their own music.  Julie herself plays the bass and still  identifies with the punk scene as the only  place where rebellious youth can find  others like themselves to express their  raw energy through music.  Julie is described by friends as kind-  hearted and sensitive, as someone who tries  to live by her beliefs.  She worked for  two years as a health care worker with  mentally handicapped children at Woodland's  ' and at the Royal Jubilee Hospital.  Presently, Ann and Julie are in a remand  centre where most of the women are awaiting  trial or transfer to long-term facilities.  There is a constant change-over of inmates.  They describe the prison as a smokey, unhealthy place with starchy food and no  exercise program. The women are rarely,  outside so most inmates spend their time  watching television or listening to the  .radio. Ann and Julie occupy themselves  with writingand reading; Julie also draws  and paints with materials purchased at  the canteen, and she plays ~giiitar.  When asked about their relationship to the  rest of the inmates, Julie explained they  were initially considered "pretty green".  So they kept to themselves and the other  women finally began to approach them.  They are pretty well accepted now and they  spend some time supporting other women  prisoners in such ways as helping to make  outside contacts.  Ann and Julie expressed concern about the  frequency of "slashing" - almost every  second day - and how it is dealt with.  They do not see these as genuine suicide  attempts, but rather an effort to localize  internal pain and feelings of powerlessness,  mainly resulting from prison conditions.  Women are treated like children; their  confidence undermined and their personal  autonomy diminished. At Lakeside, the  women are denied access to a prisoners'  paper, committees and grievance forms,  although these are frequently available in  other prisons.  Julie is particularly critical of the relationship of the guards to the inmates.  She deplores their abuse of power in making  arbitrary and sometimes irrational demands  which, if disobeyed, are punishable by isolation in the "digger". She has observed  the purposeful placing of a non-smoker with  smokers, and the withholding of medications  over which guards have full control.  She is most disturbed by the attitude of  false friendliness that many guards adopt  (often accompanied by verbal reminders that  "they are the best friends they'll ever  have"). She is uncomfortable with the potential psychological damage, and feels  this attitude confuses the inmates' ability  to recognize genuine friendship and distorts their ability to trust.  Trust is in important quality among the inmates. Ann and Julie have recognized that  it is best not to make too many overtures  of friendship, unless they are fully committed to stand behind them.  Although the prison is careful not to interfere with such rights as free access to  their lawyers, and their visits, Ann and  Julie feel they are treated differently  because they are viewed as "terrorists".  They cannot work like some of the other  inmates, because they are seen as a security risk; their requests for school enrolment have been ignored; when transported  to court they must exit from the vans with  loaded guns focused on them; their visitors are escorted from the gates (others  are not).  They believe there is a fear that they will  indoctrinate other prisoners, and that they  are singled out and scapegoated as instigators in incidents even when other women  involved have already been established as  rebellious. Ann has been forbidden to room  with other women.  When questioned directly about their situation, the two women were clear that they do  not want support people to pour all their  energy into calling for a fair trial or better media coverage, as it "furthers the  assumption that you could get a fair trial  within the criminal justice system. We  should be pointing out that it will never  be possible if you are in direct confrontation with the system...that you could receive a fair trial is just a total contradiction really".  They do not want the focus to be on getting  them out so much as on using the situation  to "further the politics of the...community  which I guess we can say our politics represent".  They are opposed to the concept of issues  as separate entities, and believe, rather,  that all tie together. For instance, the  rape of women and the "rape" of the earth  spring from the same oppressive source and  we must clearly develop an analysis of resistance to it.  Julie stressed the importance of the "conspiracy" aspect of their situation, that  it amounts to potentially being prosecuted  for talking. "If it can happen to us in a  political context, then it can happen to  other political people." Ann pointed out  that the sentence; if convicted of "conspire  acy to act" is the same as if you actually  committed the act.  Julie projects that if they are convicted  on these charges, justification will be  found to increase the budget of C.L.E.U.,  the Coordinated Law Enforcement Unit,  thereby stepping up their activities  against activists. According to Ann,  "people should fight against the "1984"  police tactics that were used to arrest  us...the whole idea of using surveillance  and wire taps."  Anyone wishing to write Ann Hansen and  Julie Belmas can do so by addressing mail -  to Oakalla Prison "Drawer  '0'", Burnaby.  When asked what they could and would like  to have sent from the outside,  they said  books were OK if sent through a bookstore  or publisher and they would enjoy little  gifts like beads,  shells or rocks...

She also does weights three  days a week for two hours. She trains four  days out of seven, minimum, for basketball.  At the last Pan-Am games she won four golds  and one silver in swimming events.  Diane Rakiecki has coached herself in track  for six years, and now does 50 to 70 miles  a week on the roads towards participation  in her first marathon to be held later  this spring. She used to be a sprinter and  dominated the Pan-Am games in the shorter  distances last year, with two gold, two  silvers, and a bronze. Now she is working  up to tackling the distance events.

Donna and Diane are but two examples of  the amazing dedication and success of disabled athletes. They are amazing because  skin deep?  and as such must be dealt with and listened to before complicating the situation  by overexertion in the name of fitness.  Neck tension, lower back problems, curved  spines and joint pain are legacies from  our sedentary and stressful lifestyle. Understanding the personal body habits and  problems that could cause injury will aid  in the development of a healthy and fit  body. Not all methods of exercising are  suitable for everyone. Specific body problems or postural habits can be overemphasized and strained during the process of  certain physical activities. For example,  any foot, knee or hip complaint will be  compounded with constant jogging or aerobics exercises. Also, riding hunched over  on a racing-style bicycle will accentuate  any pain or stiffness already lodged in  the neck and shoulders.  Through exercise we can be strong and fit,  and learn to love our bodies. The popularisation of fitness is advantageous to this  end because it has made physical activity  a part of our lifestyle. Unfortunately,  by commercialising fitness to the extent  where it is not taken seriously, it will  become a fashionable trend (passing as did  the hula hoop) instead of the means to a  healthier life. The reason we choose to  make our lives more physically active is  for our health and our bodies and not for  the profits of the fashion industry.  of the physical disabilities they are  battling against, but also because those  physical hindrances are coupled with societal prejudices that inhibit acceptance  of the disabled as physically active people, and certainly do not allow them to  demand funding, practice time, coaching  and recognition as athletes.  "People have no realization that disabled  sports people work just as hard as elite  able-bodied athletes. They sure don't  think we might have jobs to hold down too,"  says Donna.  Fortunately, disabled athletes let very  little stand in their way. Donna, for instance, has been involved in sports for as  long as she can remember. She started at  seven as a swimmer in her native New Zealand, training and competing very successfully with able-bodied athletes. It was  not until the age of twenty-one, after  several years of participation in the saltwater sport of surf lifesaving, that she  became interested in testing herself  against other athletes with similar physi-'  cal handicaps.  Donna's life centres around various aspects  of athletics. She is working towards a de- -  gree in recreation from Langara. Swimming  is still a major focus and she is training  for the 1984 Special Olympics. She just made  the Canadian national wheelchair basketball  team which means a change from water sports  as well as intense teamwork.  Family and friends are more than supportive  but the community is less encouraging.  Donna is still faced with doing all her  swimming training during the hours allocated  for general swim. She still finds it hard to  convince gym staff that time slots longer  than one hour are required to train for international basketball competition. That the  disabled train and sweat seems difficult for  many to grasp.  Diane Rakiecki dispels the myth that being  in a wheelchair means passivity. "I'm much  more active now than prior to the accident,"  she says. Diane moved to Vancouver from the  Okanagan six months ago to pursue a degree  in physical education at UBC. When she competes in the Vancouver Marathon this spring,  she says she will be the first woman to do  a wheelchair marathon, to best of her  knowledge.  Diane has always coached herself, taking  tips from books on running and adapting  them to the chair, and learning what she caf  from other wheelchair athletes. These wo  are keenly aware of their own struggles,  and eager to improve the situation for future competitors. Diane plans to use her  degree to set up programs outside the major  centres in B.C. and Donna already runs a  swimming program for the disabled.  Programs are a bit different from those for  able-bodied people. The initial emphasis is  usually on sheer participation. The disabled have rarely been encouraged to explore  new sorts of physical activity and it is  only in the past fifteen or twenty years  that there have been role models for them  to emulate as athletes.  Athletes' concerted efforts and devotion  on the part of volunteers has enabled  various organizations to encourage a div-  sity of activities for the disabled. In  fact, the range of programs and associations is astounding, given the obstacles  that they face. There are sports associations for the blind, for those afflicted  with cerebral palsy, for the deaf, for  amputees, as well as general wheelchair  sports. Competitors are divided into  classes depending on the extent of their  ability.  Women are conspicuous by their relative  absence from disabled sports competitions.  Patty Scharflen of the Canadian Wheelchair  Sports Association postulates that there  is a tendency for families to over-protect  injured women. "We have to change the attitude of the family in order to reach the  female," she says.  On the government level, Diane is currently  waging a battle for financial recognition  for successful international athletes.  Federal 'carding' which supplies assistance  to individual athletes if they have made  significant achievements on an international level, uses the same regulations for all  athletes, men and women. One of the requirements for carding is international  participation in the individual's sport.  That is, the athlete must be competing in  an event in which twenty other countries  compete annually. This requirement manages  to effectively exclude many groups from  possible carding, including swimmers and  quadraplegics, as well as women generally.  The only disabled athletes to be federally  carded so far have been men doing wheelchair track.  However, for Diane and other disabled women athletes sports is much more than a  physical activity. Diane sums it up by  saying "Training discovers my limits. It has  given me self-respect and self-confidence." 14 Kinesis April 83  April 83 Kinesis 15  Vancouver women face off  by Lynncy Powell  I tug at a soggy sock. Good - someone has  turned on the showers. My body feels well  used and spent - like you feel after making  love. To me, playing hockey and making love  are about the best ways to get your thrice-  weekly exercise (depending on how much  energy you have) .  Yes, as you have probably guessed, this is  an article on hockey. It is not the over-  glamourized version of ego-smashing-ego  that you see on the tube every Saturday  night, but women playing hockey - and  there are quite a few of us. Some of my  friends can't quite grasp my enthusiasm  as I clamber out the door with twenty-five  pounds of equipment on my back. Never mind  that it's 10 p.m. and I have to drive all  the way out to UBC for our late night practise.  There are presently 10 Senior Women's teams  in the Lower Mainland, divided into an 'A'  division and a 'B' division. The 'A' division is considered more proficient with  their skills - which is not to take anything away from the 'B' division of course!  (I have to be careful - they have some big  women on the 'B' teams.)  In the 'A' division, there are 5 teams:  Coquitlam (the division champions this  year), North Surrey, Newton, North Vancouver, and Brittania. The 'B' division consists of Kitsilano A, Kitsilano B, U.B.C.,  South Delta and Killarney. The season  'face-off is around the first week of  October, but try-outs for the teams are  held in late August and early September.  The winner of the 'A' division generally  goes on to the BC Winter Games, although  this year the women were cut from the program because of lack of time. From there,  if they have organized it and have enough  money, they can go to the 'Western Shield'.  This is a tournament held once a year in  one of the four Western provinces and it  determines "the best in the West".  But the real big Grandma of them all is  the Brampton Tournament, which is held each  year in Ontario on Easter weekend. More  than 100 women's teams from all over Canada  and the Eastern states participate. Divisions participating range from very young  women's teams (wherever they are.lucky  enough to have them), right up to Senior  'A's (which is the highest women can go in  Canada). And my-oh-my, spectators are  really treated to some fine hockey.  Back East body-checking is allowed, whereas  it isn't for women's hockey in B.C. Before  entering this tournament it's wise to make  sure your equipment is covering all your  vital areas!  Here on the Coast soccer has become very  popular among women, whereas hockey isn t  nealy as widely participated in.  One  reason why women aren't playing hockey as  much is that few women know that there is  a league out here playing exciting hockey.  Unfortunately, there are very few opportunities for women to- learn the sport.  While quite a few community centres in  B.C. have indoor ice rinks, most of the  time is designated for men's regular-team  leagues. There is often more than a year  to wait for booking this time.  Community rinks allot some time for casual  hockey but this is almost all used by men  - there are NO "women-only" times. In a  recent attempt to find time reserved for  women we could only book our own time if  we took the responsibility to ensure that  a specific number of women would be there  . every time.  This perpetuates a 'catch 22' situation  where women can't learn to play the game  unless they can get ice time, but the  rinks won't give ice time unless women are  skilled and dedicated enough to commit  themselves to the sport. What is lacking  is an opportunity to become acquainted  with the sport on a casual basis.  Expense is another factor working against  women in hockey. Hockey gear - including  skates - costs approximately $300. Ice  time and referee fees cost each team member roughly $200 per season. This cost can  be cut if the women players organize fund-  raising events.  Businesses are very rarely willing 4:o sponsor women's teams, partly because women  cannot go beyond the Senior 'A' Division.  Men's leagues, on the other hand, are  sponsored almost entirely by businesses  and sometimes by government grants in the  hope that they are contributing to the  development of NHL players. It is also  worth noting that while several Eastern  U.S. colleges offer hockey scholarships to  women, we know of none in Canada.  Hockey is not for everyone. But if you're  turned on to intense physical play then  I urge you to consider it. As usual,  things are made more difficult for women,  but as always, we are determined to overcome these inequalities. We have reserved  an hour a week of ice time for casual  hockey for women who are either beginners  or who can't afford league play. If you're  interested in casual hockey call 253-9270.

This stadium accounts for much more than the  lion's share of sports monies in the province and is a shrine to men's professional  football, baseball, and soccer.

The need for a radical change in attitudes  about sport is clearly necessary before women can achieve any sort of parity in terms  of opportunities and thereby garner the  basic benefits of participation. Work towards equality for women in sport proceeds  along various lines. As well as the necessity of encouraging participation, there is  a basic need to drastically increase the  number of role models for women - as administrators, coaches and prominent athletes.  The overriding question in any discussion  of equality for women in sports is: do we  want integration or do we want autonomy?  More specifically, will we achieve equality  faster if we simply demand that any lines  drawn on the basis of sex be eliminated altogether, or if we ask for separate but  equal, autonomous programs? The question is  complicated and exacerbated by the fact that  Canadian law is not clear on whether sport  is a federal or a provincial responsibility.  Legislators are at a point where they would  prefer not to deal with it at all. The Ontario government, for example, recently passed an amendment to its Human Rights Code  that exempts them from handling any more  sports complaints.  The Ontario ruling has brought the question of equal opportunity in athletics back  into the public eye. A Task Force was appointed almost immediately to investigate  the ramifications of the decision. CAAW&S  developed a set of recommendations to present to the Task Force in an attempt to repeal the amendment.  The demands are based on a policy of affirmative action for women. CAAW&S proposes that  recognition of women be mandatory in the  constitution of every sports organization  in the country, and that funding be withheld  from organizations that do not comply, or  do not include the objectives and goals of  women in their applications for special,  contract funding.  Yes, we do need legislation against discrimination in sport, but feminist sports activists themselves have yet to take a firm  stand. CAAW&S is still debating how to deal  exactly with the question of integrated  versus autonomous programs. Each has its  positive and negative aspects.  Integration, is desirable in two basic areas: in individual cases where the available programs for girls or women cannot  compare to those for boys; and in sports  where physical criteria are clearly negligible (e.g. archery, car racing, riding)..  Because physiological differences that affect sports performance are not manifested  until puberty it might make sense to have  fully integrated programs for children  under the age of 11 or so.  However, when integration is applied across  the board, the consequences for women can  be drastic. The clearest evidence against  sex-integrated sports programs has surfaced  recently in the United States, where an  amendment known as Title IX came into effect in 1975. Title IX states:  No person in the United States shall,  on the basis of sex,  be excluded  from participation in,  be denied the  benefits of,  or be subjected to discrimination under any educational  program or activity receiving Federal  financial assistance.  The ammendment applies to a broad range of  educational programs, but its most remarkable effects have been on sports programs.  Commenting on Title IX and its ramifications, Betty Baxter says, "In some states  where the associations are really wealthy,  it has done nothing but good. But in other  states, where there's less money, women  lose. For example, instead of men's and  women's teams, they'll have, say, a senior  and a junior team both mixed, and where  women had 12 spots guaranteed before, now  may'.,  four will make the team."  For schools unable to financially sustain  two separate programs, what Title IX does  is inspire merged programs. Critics call  them submerged programs. That is, women  disappear from leadership positions, becoming assistants to male heads of mixed  departments. In an article in 1980 in Quest  Mary Hoferek pointed out the benefits of  the previous, albeit grossly neglected,  separate programs.  "In the single-sex groups women chaired  organizations and committees,, presented  papers, looked to other females and themselves for leadership, obtained visibility,  had role models, could shape their own  organizations and could find a forum for  their concerns."  Women can lose these opportunities in male  dominated, co-ed, associations. Clearly,  integrated programs, while they might be  a long-term goal, cannot function properly  unless the two sides are coming from equally|  strong positions from the outset.  Marion Lay of CAAW&S is also wary of the  effects of plunging women into the often  destructive climate of today's sports world  "I'm not so sure we want to put women into  that environment. There's a lot of pain,  a lot of drugs, and people are abusing  their bodies. I think women would probably  have a better experience with each other,  but we have to look at our goals too. If  we separate too much, we are in danger  of simply being legislated out completely.  We have to stay in control."  CAAW&S's present position is an attempt  to strike balance between integrated and  autonomous programs: selected integration.  It means opting for integration where desirable or necessary; while promoting women's association, and new sports that  acknowledge the power and flexibility of  women's bodies. 16 Kinesis April 83

Of the seventy athletes in the Canadian
Delegation who attended the first Gay
Olympics, Vancouver was represented by an
all women's soccer team and one lesbian
runner. Under Canadian, British Columbian
and Vancouver banners, the gay men and women in red and white uniform were pround
to be among the 1,500 athletes and twelve
countries represented at the Games.
For the first time in history lesbians and
gay men competed proudly and openly. We
challenged the notion that athletes have
to be closeted or ashamed of being homosexual .
As we came through the gates of the enormous stadium in Golden Gate Park we followed marching bands, baton twirlers, a
thirty piece lesbian percussion group and
were welcomed by six choirs, the acting
mayor of San Francisco, a congressman, .
Rita Mae Brown and thousands of cheering,
whistling and waving spectators. We all
joined together in the anthem "Reach for
the Sky" sung by Meg Christian and then
athletes and spectators alike crowded
around the stage to watch Tina Turner
start.off the first International Gay
Olympics with an electrifying performance .'
For many of us it was one of the most
meaningful moments of our lives. We were
finally out together in an international
movement!
The cooperation in Vancouver and San
Francisco between gay men and lesbians
was wonderful. They helped with the
fundraising for our soccer team, came
out to our games and in our final silver
medal winning match they presented each
of us with a red and white carnation.
However, the economic differences between gay men and women were evident by
the fact that women constituted only forty
percent of the athletes. There were also
very few third world people in the games.
Sexism reared its ugly, but familiar,
head when we noticed the men's teams
being introduced by individual players,
as is the correct formal procedure, and
women's teams were being introduced by
team name and city alone. We immediately
asked for a correction and received an
apology.
Organizing on an international scale
made us realize the incredible power we
have gained by reaching out beyond our
own small communities. We gained a fuller sense of ourselves and the world. By
working hard and playing hard and taking
ourselves seriously as athletes we also
gained a sense of personal pride that we
will carry with us forever.
Local lesbians compete in Gay Olympics
in
by Anita Tremblay
It was a Thursday evening, late in June
1982 and "Bud's Good Eats" were practising
ball drills on the soccer field at 22nd
and Laurel when'someone said the words:
Gay Olympics for the first time. It was
Ellen Woodsworth and after she.filled us
in on a few of the details she suggested
enthusiastically: "Hey! Why don't we go?"
Well, the reactions from the team, a random group of women most of whom call themselves lesbians, not all of whom call themselves athletes and few who call themselves feminists, varied from: "Yeah!
Right on!" to "Who? Us?" to "Dream on..."
That was late June. Two months later we
were standing in the middle of Keizar
Stadium in Golden Gate Park our knees
a-shakin' and our hearts a-thumpin' waiting
for the first game to begin. ,
In the two months between the inspiration
and the fact, the process that we went
through, as individuals arta as a team, was
phenomenal. Ellen and I took on the organizing of the event and as two die-hard
feminists our first tasks were to attempt
to find a basis of unity, work collectively
and introduce such concepts as a sliding
scale for those who needed financial assistance to get there.
The diverse political orientation of the
women on the team made all of these things
impossible so we resorted to taking over
and badgering, harrassing and guilting
people into participating in fundraising
and organizing. This seemed to work rather
well so we stuck to it."
We borrowed what we couldn't raise and one
way or another we got together enough
money to get twenty women down to San
Francisco for six days of soccer playing
and the most intense Gay Pride experience
of our lives.
So, there we were, on our way to San Fran,
some of us packed six to a vehicle, as
excited as a bunch of kids on their way
to summer camp. Although I don't think
any one of us would have traded that experience and the positive things we drew
from it for anything, the outcome of that
trip had a shattering effect on our team.
The combination of political differences,
sexual politics, competitive pressures,
living and working together and just personality dynamics (not to mention half the
team menstruating together) made for a
series of many faceted explosions with
underlying emotional tensions that resulted in the demise of our one and only lesbian soccer team.  ■\"i -^
"Welcome Gay Athletes" the signs read and
they were up all over the city, not just
on Cassiar street! Multitudes of gay men
and lesbians crowded the streets, bars
and cafes day and night. The city was veritably vibrating withjpur collective energy
and 'out of the closets' courage.
The Gay Olympics symbolized, for many of
us, a new spirit of pride, health and
unity. It took the trite or corny tone out
of the words: "Gay Pride" and gave them a
new meaning. For lesbians, I think it gave
us a new image of ourselves as strong,
healthy, organized women creating something on an international level. The Gay
Olympics received international press
coverage. Hence, we were not only creating
powerful and positive role models for
other lesbians all over the world we were
a part of making history.
One last thing I feel compelled to mention:
the quality of the,organization of the
event was evident from the moment we walked
into the registration office with half a
dozen telephones ringing, busily connecting
the billets with athletes arriving from
New Zealand, France, Denmark, Ireland,
Greenland, Peru...
Did you know that:

Canada's first Olympian was Cecil
Eustache Smith, a figure skater in the
first Winter Olympics in 1924.
the 1923 women's track and field team
won the unofficial championship at the
Amsterdam Olympics, led by the world a-
chievement of the '4 x 100' metre relay
team.
Ethel Catherwood was Canada's first female Olympic gold medalist in an individual event,, winning the high jump in 1928.
the Edmonton Grads, a basketball team
whose players (except for two) came from  '
the same school in Edmonton, was in existence from 1915 to 1940, coached by the
same person (Percy Page), won 502 out of
522 games, was recognized as world champions from 1925 on, and is considered to
be the most outstanding women's basketball team of all time - anywhere!
in 1930, when the Grads were unable to
attend, a determined UBC team Won the
Women's World Basketball Championships
in Prague.
Abby Hoffman, track athlete and Christilot <
Boylen (nee Hansen), equestrian, have
earned the unequalled distinction of membership of four consecutive Canadian
Olympic teams - from 1964 to 1976.
On the basis of Olympic and Commonwealth
Games events offered, for the period from
1924 to 1976, Canadian women have won a
larger percentage of medals available to
them than have Canadian men.
Canada has provided several outstanding
female marathon swimmers - from Marilyn
Bell, who captured the country's atteii—
tion in 1954 when she swam Lake Ontario
to Cindy Nicholas, who set several world
long distance and English channel records
in the 1970's.
Beverly Boys, the most talented diver
Canada has ever sent to the Commonwealth
Games, became, in 1978, the only woman
from any country in any sport to win
medals in four Commonwealth games. April 83 Kinesis 17  by Betty Baxter  Although C.A.A.W.&S. is a very new organization, in the last 6 months we have been  working in a number of areas and are beginning to see some positive results. In  addition to outlining the work to date,  this article will include the issues scheduled for discussion at the C.A.A.W.&S.  annual general meeting Ln May since these  issues will be the focus for future efforts.  At the provincial level, C.A.A.W.&S. in  B.C. has an office at 1200 Hornby St.  (tel 687-3333) and from that space has four  temporary employees working in the following areas:  Women in Sport:  better equipped to choose an appropriate  activity for them. We hope next year to  continue this project by taking this presentation around the province and meeting  with women in small communities to determine fitness programs that are available  or could be started with some energy or  direction from C.A.A.W.&S.  A Series of educational meetings on  women and sport  Three public meetings were held with the  aim of offering information on programs  available to women in three specific areas  of sport and recreation.  In selecting the topics for these meetings  we looked at areas where women were not  frequent participants but also areas where  Working  toward a positive  image  Development of a media kit  Women in sports or any kind of physical  activity are rarely reported in the media.  When reporting has been done emphasis is  frequently on the athlete or team's looks,  marital or family status and the athletic  achievement is not seriously dealt with.  C.A.A.W.&S. will attempt to inform the  media about women's sporting activities.  A media kit will be the first step.  This kit includes information on the  founding of C.A.A.W.&S., selected media  articles on women in sports, photos for use  in promoting women and sport, and a summary  of C.A.A.W.&S. projects to date. This package will be sent to members of the various  media to give them information and encourage the use of a positive image of women  in sport.  Preparation of an Information Referral  System for Women's Sport and Recreation  Programs in B.C..  Because women have not traditionally belonged to sport clubs or athletic associations, it is often difficult and confusing  to find out what programs are available to  women and how to join one that does exist.  C.A.A.W.&S. is trying to centralize this  information.  We have gathered information on programs  for women and co-ed programs offered in  community centers and educational institutions around B.C. This information includes  details about cost, length of programs,  whether recreational or competitive, level  of skill requirements to join and age  categories of each program.  Now this material is being entered on to  the Telidon system, a project under the  Vancouver Information and Referral System.  This will make information on women's  sport available to the public at Telidon  locations throughout Vancouver. There are  plans to expand the Telidon system throughout the province. The C.A.A.W.&S. referral  system will have complete information of  Vancouver programs by April, and programs  from around the province later this year.  Hopefully the program will be updated  annually to give women easy and accurate  access to sport and recreation programs.  A Slide-Tape Presentation on various  options in fitness activities  This presentation will include slides of  women in various types of physical activity. The viewer will be introduced to two  women who are trying to choose an activity  program to help them become fit. They will'  investigate and discuss the programs involving team sports, aerobit activities,  individual and outdoor sports. Slides will  give the pros and cons of each. The aim of  the presentation is for women to come away  there is some movement afoot for women to  become more involved. The^ first meeting  was a field sports seminar which brought  together women from five different field  sports. Presentations were given on soccer, touch football, field hockey, rugby  and lacrosse. Participants then had a  chance to try a new sport, or teach someone else above a sport that they knew  well.  The second meetings was on women in the  outdoors. It was co-sponsored by the  Vancouver Women's Outdoor Club. The  third m-eting was on coaching opportunities In all three meetings, how to get  involved was the main emphasis.  C.A.A.W.&S. Nationally  Because sport has been traditionally such  an "old boys network", women in sport lack  information and knowledge about the system  they are trying to change. The focus of  work for C.A.A.W.&S. at a national level  has been communicating what we know and  getting access to more information.  Three major projects were started this  year. The first is a quarterly newsletter.  For this year the newsletter is being published in B.C. It aims to provide a network between C.A.A.W.&S. members but also  provide an informative, promotional vehicle  for C.A.A.W.&S. All members receive the  newsletter, but for anyone else the first  two issues are available at the C.A.A.W.&S.  office: 1200 Hornby St. Vancouver.  The" second national project was a leadership seminar held at the University of  Ottawa March 11-13, 1983. At the seminar  presentations were given on:  - the workings of government, Federal  policy and decision-making (where the  access points are)  - networking  - affirmative action programs  - organizing public meetings  - lobbying  Some time was spent as well on local initiatives and what progress the last year has  seen. These included:  - a feminist committee in the Canadian  Cycling Association who have so far succeeded in having an elected member (woman)  at the decision-making level and a constitutional change in their association to improve the quality of women's participation.  - a brief by the Ottawa chapter of  C.A.A.W.&A. to the Sopinka Task Force on  Ontario Human Rights  - work that has been done in B.C. (mentioned earlier) and ideas for next year.  %  ~&<r   3        -9~  -^B-      ■&  w  IT*. ^P*7t^  zi' it  V  ; ^"£"3^^"^  ^% j'  il  _A  g^   %  1   ft  [  "s-  The seminar concluded with a strategy  session where we looked at the hiring statistics of the Halifax Board of Education  with regard to hiring or firing of women  physical education teachers.  The third national effort is focussed on a  pilot project in two cities: Vancouver,  B.C., and Hamilton, Ontario. In these  cities we are investigating the use of  publicly funded facilities to see if their  booking policies or practices discriminate  against women. Two women are collecting  data in Vancouver (specifically regarding  fields and rinks) and a group of people in  Hamilton are collecting data on all facilities (i.e., fields, rinks, pools, gyms).  This project should give useful data to  determine if city governments are adequately responding to the increased interest of  women in fitness and recreational activities .  Given that these projects have meant hard  .work and only small changes for women and  sport so far, the annual general meeting  of the C.A.A.W.&S. will address overall  strategy for coming years and what new projects should be taken on. At that meeting  workshops will be held on the following  topics:  ;;llllll!      IP     I  %  *-%  1. Human rights - should sport be included  in the human rights codes? What does that  mean in terms of integrated or separate  programs?  2. Declining participation of teenage  girls in sport.  3. Dearth of women coaches.  4. Facility usage and access to community  funded programs.  5. Canadian University Athletics programs  - recent study confirming declining jobs  and involvement of women.  6. How to monitor existing sport programs.  7. Promotion and visibility of C.A.A.W.&S.  as a viable place where women can initiate  and push for change in sport.  The annual general meeting of C.A.A.W.&S.  will be held at the University of Manitoba  in Winnipeg, May 27-29, 1983. Anyone is  welcome. We are hoping to take a caravan  from B.C. so please join us. 18 Kinesis April 83  HEALTH  1**  svtV^  xxiv&  n  oV»etv  by Kristen Penn  Wt'  This is the first of a two part series on  Valium and the minor tranquilizers.  The  second part which will talk about withdrawal from Valium and alternatives to  drugs will appear in the next issue.  Valium, Librium, Serax, Ativan, these are  familiar names of some of the minor tranquilizers which have become household  words in the last twenty years. At this  moment, 15% of women and 10% of men in the  western world are currently taking Valium,  the most widely prescribed drug of any  kind in the world.  Valium is just one of the many mind or  mood altering drugs including the minor  and major tranquilizers, anti-depressants  and sleeping pills which are known as psychotropic drugs.  In Canada, at any given  time, one woman in five is taking a psychotropic drug. Not surprisingly, women  Receive fully two-thirds of the prescriptions for "mind or mood altering drugs.  For the last two decades, the drug companies have marketed the minor tranquilizers  such as Valium and Librium through a promotional campaign unlike any before. Medical journals abounded with ads directed at  doctors such as the one which showed a woman behind bars made up of brooms and mops  with the caption: "You can't set her free,  but you can help her feel less anxious."  Another ad pictured a woman who, it is  noted, has an MA degree which she is not  currently using and who is not content with  the PTA and housework. This, the doctor is  advised, contributes to her unsubstantiated  gynecological complaints which should be  treated with tranquilizers.  Librium, which was first produced by the  Hoffman-LaRoche company in 1960, was seen  as a wonder drug to control anxiety and was  prescribed with what one doctor described  as "wild abandon." Three years later, the  same pharmaceutical company produced Valium  which was promoted for the relief of "psychic tension". The two together quickly  became the most commercially successful  prescription drugs in history. And Hoffman-  LaRoche became, according to Fortune magazine, "one of the most profitable enterprises on earth."  In the 60's and early 70's, the pharmaceutical industry used intensive promotional  campaigns to relabel and redefine as mental illness a whole range of stress filled  situations that had traditionally been regarded as general proglems of living which  were now to be "treated with drugs". Such  situations as "apprehension about national  and world conditions," ''raising a young  family," "writing a doctoral dissertation,"  and being a mother with "too little time to  pursue a vocation for which she has spent  many years training," now came within the  scope of medicine and thus warranted treatment with tranquilizers.  Most of the advertisements for reducing  tension and anxiety depicted women ranging  from the harried housewife to the fearful  young college student to the chronically  complaining patient who was an annoyance  to the doctor. Women having problems fulfilling the rigidly defined social roles  were seen as exhibiting signs of emotional  or mental illness that needed treatment  with drugs.  It would be considered completely unethical for antibiotics to be advertised for  the common cold, but it is not considered  unusual to prescribe an anti-depressant  to a woman who does not have the energy to  do her housework or to prescribe a tranquilizer to an old person who is angry at  being placed in a nursing home against her  W^?^-  about anxiety-like rebound y  toms when tranquilizer  Tranxene9 helps avoid them.  dorazepate W ,  dipotassium  Valium and its Family  Brand Nan  ie  Generic Name  Manufacturer  Daily  Ativan  lorazepam  Wyeth  1-10 mg  Centrax  prazepam  Parke-Davis  20-60 mg  Dalmane  flurazepam  Roche  15-30 mg  Librium  chlordiazepoxide  Roche  15-100 mg  Libritabs  (generic  chlordiazepoxide  (several)  15-100 mg  forms)  Paxipam  halazepam  Schering  60-160 mg  Restoril  temazepam  Sandoz  15-30 mg  Serax  oxazepam  Wyeth  10-30 mg  Tranxene SD,  Tranxene  clorazepate  Abbott  15-60 mg  Valium*  d iazepam  Roche  4-40 mg  Xanax  alprazolam  Upjohn  0.75-4 mg  *   Approxin  ate cost for an average  10-day supply  NA: Not Av  ailable  will.  Instead of psychiatry using the  products of the drug industry when they  might be useful, what has happened is that  the drug industry has actually shaped psychiatry by defining what is considered  mental or emotional illness.  During the 1970's, women's groups, health  and consumer advocate groups focused attention on the disproportionate use of  tranquilizers by women. In 1979, Hearings  in the U.S. congress probed the use of  psychoactive drugs by women. While the actual drug advertisements no longer blatantly focus on women's social roles, there  is still recognition of the usefulness of  Valium for maintaining social homeostasis.  In a recent symposium oh Valium, the chairman stated, "We hear much about the adverse  affects of the drugs and their costs, while  we hear little in terms of how many divorces Valium may prevent."  Meanwhile, the drug companies have continued in their practice of creating non-  disease states which they claim need to be  treated with tranquilizers.  In a recent  campaign headlined Negative Tests-Positive  Symptoms,  Valium is suggested for individuals experiencing symptoms of disease  to be caused by anxiety - with no test  results suggesting the actual presence of  results suggesting the actual presence of  disease. The ad suggests first starting  the patient on Valium, then reassuring  them about their physical complaints,  rather than providing reassurance and  helping them deal with their anxiety without drugs.  There is also an increase of advertising  that stresses the use of Valium as an adjunct for those who have positive medical  tests as well. The ad implies to the doctor that by not treating the "emotional"  aspects of an illness, such as heart disease or ulcers, that he or she would not  be treating the "whole person" and would  thereby be remiss in their medical practice. Doctors are advised that "the patient's psychosocial profile adds valuable  insights and often reveals excessive anxiety." The answer to this problem is, of  course, Valium. April 83 Kinesis 19  HEALTH  Another group targeted for increased tranquilizer use is older people. One ad shows  an older man enjoying a model ship with  his grandson with the caption reading,  "Stress and the Senior Citizen - a time  for reappraisal." With the increasing a-  wareness within the health care system of  the links between stress and disease, the  drug companies are taking the opportunity  to sell the idea that Valium is the answer to the problem of stress.  Hazards and side effects  Valium is the biggest seller in a family  of drugs called the benzodiazepines, all  of which have similar effects, hazards and  addictive qualities. Valium, Serax, .  Librium and Ativan^ and a few others are  marketed* as tranquilizers^, while Dalmane  and Restoril are sold as sleeping pills.  In the United States, one in every four  prescriptions is for some kind of mind or  mood altering drug.  In Canada, the figure is closer to one in  five.  Considering that 3/4 -of all visits  to doctors end in a prescription, that  amounts to an enormous amount of psychotropic drugs consumed every year. In spite  of the evidence that Valium and other benzodiazepines are not useful longer than  one month, doctors continue to prescribe  the drug to people for months and years.  It is not uncommon for people to take  Valium for one, or even five to ten years.  While all the benzodiazepines have similar  dangers and side effects, there is a difference in the length of time the drug remains in the body. A single dose of the  long-acting drugs (Valium, Librium, Dalmane) can remain in the body for up to two  days. When used regularly, it can take up  to two weeks for the body to become drug-  free after ingesting the last dose. With  the long-acting drugs, there is greater  risk of the drug accumulating to dangerous  levels, especially in older people or those  with liver disease, such as alcoholics.  Valium is prescribed to older people more  often than any other age and it is frequently used for alcohol withdrawal, thus  placing these two groups particularly at  PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS  A series of talks on their effects, hazards  and alternatives.

The shorter acting drugs such as  Ativan and Serax are less likely to cause  drowsiness or to accumulate in the body,  but they may produce more dramatic withdrawal symptoms if dependence develops.  For the most part, all the members of the  Valium family are different brands of the  same drug. Aside from the difference in the  time it takes to eliminate the drug from  the body, the effects and hazards are the  same with all the drugs. Most people who  use Valium have not been told of the dangers involved. Often times concerns expressed by the recipient of a prescription  are dismissed by the doctor as groundless.  This is particularly true for concerns expressed about the dangers of addiction  which are still denied by the makers of  Valium as well as many doctors even though  the risk of addiction is a fact.  Valium is known to cause:  Mental impairment: Memory and learning a-  bility is worse in the majority of people  who use Valium. Lack of concentration,  drowsiness and decreased co-ordination are  also frequent side effects. There is confusion, particularly in older people where  it is misdiagnosed as senility.  Impaired driving:  Driving skills such as  braking ability become worse. Slowed reaction time makes Valium users more likely to  have traffic accidents.  Mood changes:  These include restlessness,  irritability, increased depression.  Hallucinations and paradoxical rage:    Ironically, in some people Valium can cause  the very opposite of "tranquility." These  reactions are not common but they can be  dangerous when they occur.  Addiction:  Hoffman-LaRoche continues to  claim that addiction to Valium is rare and  only happens in "abuse prone personalities"  who exceed the recommended dosage. In fact,  anyone taking even low dosages of the drug  for over 3-4 months is in danger of becoming physically and/or psychologically addicted. Withdrawal symptoms include troube  sleeping, depression, headache, muscle  twitching and pain, nausea, trembling and  skin reactions. It is extremely important  to not stop taking Valium suddenly after  using it regularly for 3 months or more.  Abrupt withdrawal can lead to seizures and  can precipitate a psychotic episode such  as Barbara Gordon reported in her book  "I'm Dancing As Fast As I Can."  In addition to these "side-effects," there  are other serious hazards associated with  Valium use.  In combination with other central nervous depressants, such as alcohol,  sleeping pills, anti-histamines, etc.,  Valium can cause sudden death. Since Valium  is commonly.prescribed for alcohol withdrawal, many alcoholics begin taking Valium  regularly and the two are often used in  combination. With alcohol consumption,being  so common among the general population, the  Valium-alcohol combination is a routine  occurance that poses dangers of toxicity.  Since the drug stays in the body for days  and accumulates in the fatty tissues, the  Valium taken yesterday can react with the  alcohol taken today.  Valium, in combination with alcohol and  other drugs has been implicated in 10-25%  of the suicide attempts in the United  States.  In Canada, Valium is the single  most common drug involved in both unintentional poisonings and suicide attempts  among adults.  There is also evidence that Valium can  cause birth defects when it is taken within  the first three months of pregnancy. The  most common problem has been cleft palate,  though it has also been linked to mental  retardation. When Valium is taken by the  pregnant woman close to delivery, there is  i M  ii *  4'i*  mm  I'm  Old  'e (^JfrJMto  You cant set her free.

This person takes care of the pregnant woman, her  labor and delivery, and the newborn and  new mother in the postpartum period. She  delivers babies in a less scientific and  more empathetic and intuitive manner than  a physician would.  The midwife profession has been worldwide  throughout history and has been practised  as both an art and a trade.  In recent  history, the art has been taken over by  the science of medicine under the name of  "obstetrics."  Women have always used midwives because  they believed they needed to have a woman  accompanying them throughout labor and  delivery. A midwife suits this function  because she is trained and accustomed to  sit by a woman for many hours watching a  natural process taking place and waiting.  Doctors, after being trained for over ten  years at university are not suited to sit  and watch and wait.  Canada is one of the nine countries in the  World Health Organization which does not  provide for the training and certification  of midwives. The other countries are:  Venezuala, Panama, New Hebrides, Honduras,  El Salvador, Columbia, Burundi and Dominican Republic. The world's lowest rates of  perinatal mortality are achieved in Holland and the Scandinavian Countries where  midwives attend many of the births.  There are only two provinces in Canada  where midwives can practise legally.  In  Newfoundland a midwifery school trains  nurses to practise as nurse midwives in  the province and outpost areas.  In New  Brunswick, there is no Midwifery Act, but  there is nothing in the Health Act which  prevents midwives from practising.  In Alberta there is a program called the  "Alberta School of Obstetrical Nursing"  which trains nurses for outpost and case-  room work. A similar program is offered  in British Columbia. Both programs are  available to registered nurses only and  the areas where these nurses can deliver  babies are places where there are no doctors nearby, such as in the Arctic.  Most births in Canada are attended by doctors or obstetricians in a hospital setting. Doctors are trained to see births  as a medical event rather than a physiological one, and so use much medical intervention in attending births. When  medical students go into delivery rooms  to observe deliveries, it is rare that  they have an opportunity to see a natural  birth.  Caesarian section rates are on the rise.  In some Canadian hospitals, as many as  30% of the deliveries are by Caesarian  section. Some Canadian physicians attend  home deliveries but these are few in number. The Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of every province frown on doctors  attending home births. Reprisals, such  as loss of hospital privileges are common.  In Alberta, in April of 1981, the College  of Physicians and Surgeons made it illegal  for physicians to attend home deliveries.  They also forbid physicians to administer  prenatal care to women intending to have  a homebirth.  Consumer groups throughout Canada such as  the "International Childbirth Education  Association" have sought to improve conditions for birthing in hospitals. Women  are better informed as to the process of  labor and delivery, many take prenatal  classes which help them to prepare for the  event, and there are now some options made  available for birthing mothers. They can  use or avoid pain-killers during their  labor and they can hold the baby for  "bonding" directly after the birth.  Some  Out of our hands  Midwifery  in Canada  hospitals offer birthing rooms which provide a homelike atmosphere. But unfortunately many medical interventions still  occur in these birthing rooms.  All of these choices for the birthing woman are only tokens handed out by the  medical staff resulting from pressure from  the consumer groups. The problem with  these improvements is that they do not  change the source of control from physician to birthing woman. For this reason  many women are opting for homebirths with  unlicensed midwives. They feel that it is  a positive step in experiencing a natural  birth and staying in control of their labor and delivery.  Many of the midwives who are attending  homebirths throughout Canada are "lay" or  "empirical" midwives. They have learned  the skills outside of an institution,  often by apprenticing with another woman  who is already a midwife. A few lay mid-  wives in Canada have attended over three  hundred deliveries, many have attended  over one hundred and fifty.  Some have  gone to midwifery courses or workshops;  all have read widely on the subject.  The midwife spends a great deal of time  working prenatally with the expectant  mother. A history and physical examination are done to exclude high risk candidates from a homebirth. The pregnant woman is helped to choose an excellant diet.  Sufficient exercise and study of the pro-  esses of labor and delivery are expected.  On each prenatal visit with the midwife,  the woman's weight is checked to be sure  that she has an adequate weight gain.  Blood pressure, fundal height, and position of the baby are determined. Many  hours are spent with the midwife to encourage trust and communication but control over the birth itself remains in the  hands of the pregnant woman.  Since there is no certification for mid-  wives in Canada, the level of expertise  varies greatly.  Some midwives carry no  more than a few herbs in their birth kit.  Others are experienced in the use of intravenous solution for the treatment of shock,  drugs and manual methods to stop hemmorhage,  catheters to suction the baby if necessary,  oxygen to monitor the fetal heartbeat, and j  suturing supplies to repair any perineal  tears that might occur. It is up to the  expectant parents to choose a midwife who  has methods and expertise with which they  feel comfortable.  All across Canada, except for the few  areas I have mentioned it is illegal for  midwives, no matter how or where they were  trained, to deliver babies.  Every time a  midwife attends a birth she could be  charged with "practising medicine without  a license." If something goes wrong at  the birth, she could be charged with criminal negligence or if there was a death  involved, manslaughter.  In January of this year, three midwives  from Nova Scotia were charged with "criminal negligence" following a homebirth.  The baby, who was delivered by the mid-  wives, did not breathe spontaneously and  was transferred to hospital and put on a  respirator. The neonatologist called the  police.  Subsequently the Attorney General  laid charges of "criminal negligence  leading to bodily harm,',' against the mid-  wives. Their first court hearing will be  on the second of June.  If this incident had occured in the hospital, it would have been called an unfortunate accident.  The trial will not be just  about this particular case, but about all  cases of homebirth attended by empirical  midwives.  The province of Nova Scotia is  challenging the right of one woman to help  another woman give birth outside the hospital system.  It challenges our right to  choose our own birthing experience.  Midwives are beginning to organize all  over Canada.  In Ontario, midwives have  formed a group called the "Ontario Association of Midwives." This group served  as a support group when two midwives attended a birth where the baby died. The  death occurred hours after the laboring  woman was transferred to the hospital for  a problem in the labor. No matter what  the circumstances are surrounding a birth,  the midwives are usually blamed because  they do not have a role in the health system.  However, following the inquest, the  judge suggested that doctors and midwives  establish communication and that Ontario  should be the first province to certify  midwives.  Unfortunately, the Minister of  Health declared the province had no plans  to include the licensure of midwives.  In British Columbia, midwives are well  organized.  They have formed an association called the Midwives Association of  British Columbia, and have organized two  conferences, one in 1980 and the second  one in February of 1983. To help with  planning the integration of midwives into  the medical system, the "Midwifery Task  Force" was formed. Physicians, nurse and  lay midwives and parents are working together to achieve the same goals, education  and licensure of midwives. In the 1983  conference, midwives, parents and physicians joined to promote co-operation between midwives and midwifery organizations  across Canada. Steps were taken to form a  national organization to ensure better  communication and facilitate licensure.  Midwives practising in Canada are doing so  because they feel it is their calling.  They have decided that they can help women  experience happy and safe births at home.  Every time a midwife attends a birth she  is taking a legal and personal risk. We  should support midwives in Canada in their '  work to return the experience of childbirth to the birthing woman.  The midwives in Nova Scotia who were recently charged with criminal negligence  are in need of financial aid to help with  legal costs. Defending these midwives is  to defend our right to choose our birth  experience and our birth attendant. Please  send cheques to: A.P.S.A.C.

But Daly's style was hardly a traditional  lecture. It was an "invitation to take a  journey", she said, "into the country of  the strange, the homeland of women".  While this approach may liave confused at  least some portion of her 500 strong audience, the hearty and enthusiastic response  punctuating her endless stream of witticisms  and wordplay revealed a large following of  women who knew precisely what she was talking about.  The, journey, which she outlines in her last  book, Gyn/Ecology: The MetaEthics of Radical  Feminism, is toward what she calls our original integrity, our original being, the  truth of womanhood and woman energy before  it was buried under a "crust of patriarch-  ial lies." These are the lies that keep  women from knowing their innermost selves,  says Daly. "We are struggling to re-member  ourselves and our history," she told her  audience, and in so doing we are coming to  understand what has happened to our own  passions.  Daly believes women have been denied their  own souls, meaning their knowledge of themselves, as well as the expression of their  own "real" passions. A key portion of her  talk centred on her attempt to distinguish  "real passions" from "pseudo-passions."  Real passions, like love, desire, joy, hate,  sorrow, fear, daring, hope, despair and  anger have an object, she said. They move  toward reality outside of oneself. But our  real passions have been covered over by  man-made counterfeits, false passions, in  which she includes guilt, frustration, anx  iety, resentment, boredom, bitterness and  fulfillment.  "When I'm called a bitter woman", she said,  "my passion is reduced to a lemon. In fact,  I am enraged and there is a reason for  that." And fulfillment, according to Daly,  is the saddest of all the pseudo-passions.  "Just where does one go," she asked, "when  one is filled full?"  The separation of the real from the false  is the point of the journey. She believes  women must recover their original knowledge  of themselves, realizing that numerous diversions, obstacles and even punishments  stop women from fully exploding society's  deceptions about womanhood.  "But you must realize," said Daly, "that  even if you are just a little bit of a  feminist you will be punished just as much  as if you go the whole way." To go the  "whole way" is to reclaim one's self-esteem  and in order to do that women will encounter  what she calls "the terrible taboo".  "The terrible taboo is the taboo against  women's most natural act...women touching  women on the deepest level. It is the taboo  against female connection." Women who are  ontologically touched by women move beyond  the barriers and the boundaries of patriarchy and in so doing "become terrible".  "We are outrageous in crossing this taboo,"  she said. "We are deviant. We are women who  choose to become wild."  Clearly the journey toward uncovering women's mutilated self-esteem in Daly's view  can only be achieved by a full connection  between women. She was quick to point out,  however, that women touching women should  not be reduced to the sexual sphere alone.  Being gay, in and of itself, is not the  ■. To deal only with the sexual con-  If you love this planet...  by Lisa Jenkinson  At the end of February this NFB film was  declared by the U.S. government to be "foreign propaganda". Anyone showing the film  in the U.S. must record their name with the  U.S. Department of Justice or adcfa disclaimer at the beginning of the film stating  it to be "foreign propaganda". The American  Civil Liberties Association is taking the  government's decision to federal court,  claiming that Reagan's measurement is unconstitutional and suppression of free  speech.  IF YOU LOVE THIS PLANET  a National Film Board (NFB) Production  Directed by:    Terri Nash  Produced by:    Edward Le Lorrain  Executive Producer: Kathleen Shannon  I had a chance to view this 25 minute documentary in mid-March at Simon Fraser University. I'd heard a lot about it and the fact  that it had been recently blacklisted in  the U.S. made me curious to see for myself  this "dangerous film".  The speaker in the film is Dr. Helen Caldi-  cott, an Australian born physician now living in the U.S. For almost a decade, Dr.  Caldicott has been waging a public education campaign to inform people everywhere  of the hazards of the Nuclear Age.  She is  currently the national president of the  Physicians for Social Responsibility.  Throughout the film Dr. Caldicott talks to  a group of university students about the  fact that every human being must begin taking action immediately if we hope to save  this planet from nuclear destruction. In-  tersperced in the film is footage of some  of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  outlining the horrifying effects that a  nuclear explosion can have on the human  body. Also included are two short clips  from an early 1940's war film, "Jap Zeor",  featuring Ronald Reagan as a bomber pilot,  ever so eager to do his job. As I watched  these particular segments, it became much  clearer to my why the U.S. government has  taken such drastic action against the showing of this film.  Caldicott compares the arms race to two  little boys fighting in a sandbox over who  has the biggest biceps, bow and arrow or  truck. She likened the mentality of the  world's leaders to that of a nine year old.  More, she points out that the Soviet Union  signed the Salt II treaty, but the U,S.  wouldn'Obecause they insist on maintaining their "more powerful" world image.  She went on to make the following points:  • Among the extent of injuries which any  possible survivors of a nuclear war could  incur are: blindness, deafness, third degree burns and a loss of the immunity to  disease, since the antibodies present in  the blood would be drastically changed or  destroyed by radioactive isotypes in the  air.  • Massive outbreaks of all the diseases  which we now have immunization for. Because  of the literally millions of corpses that  would be around after a bombing, an ideal  breeding ground for bacteria would be present and the radioactivity in the air would  mutate the bacteria and viruses to a point  f  nection is to buy back into patriarchy and  ultimately to reinforce patriarchy's systematic fragmentation of the 'whole self.  Within patriarchial culture, women constitute what she calls the "touchable caste".  Women are touched in this sense all the  time and throughout history by rape, battering, maiming, and dismembering. She uses  the word caste because it implys a rigidity  that does not come through in the word  class, and because it more closely identifies the kind of psychic violence that keeps  women in their place.  Because Daly believes patriarchial culture  is necrophilic", centering on a love of  death, decay, and destruction, her counsel  to women is to embrace a biophilic (love  of life) direction throughout all aspects  of their cultural lives. In this sense, it  is not enough to do battle with existing  norms, cultivating only a 'warrior spirit'  in our personal selves. We must also create,  weave, spin new meanings into our lives  and our current reality. She dispenses with  any notion of a feminist future, for example  saying we create only in the present, in the  here and now.  What is most interesting to those women who  have followed Daly through her three books,  The Church and the Second Sex, Beyond God  the Father, and Gyn/Ecology is how far she  has gone on her own personal and spiritual  journey. Where she was once a reformist in  and apologist for the Catholic Church, she  has now reached a point where she believes  the only purpose for feminists attempting  reform within the church is the personal  process in finding a way out. To Daly, the  whole notion has become analagous to a black  person attempting reform within the Ku Klux  Klan. The lies about woman, pornographic or  otherwise, are"rooted in theological lies.  When she reached this conclusion for herself, she left the Church and centred her  philosophical pursuits within a radical  feminist context.  In a press conference just hours before her  lecture Daly told an amusing story about  her invitation by a minister during the 60's  to speak about women and the church in a  sermon. She said she decided she would end  her speech by walking out of the Church and  inviting women to walk out with her. "I  thought only a few would follow me," she  said, "and that the whole thing would be  quite embarrassing. Nevertheless, I made the  invitation and about a hundred women walked  out with me, much to my surprise. "Word of  the event spread quickly, and in a week she  was receiving calls from ministers asking  her if she would like to come to their  churches and have a 'walkout'. She was  dumbfounded. "I don't think you understand," she told the ministers, "I have  walked out. Don't you.understand? I am not  there anymore; I have left."  Where will Mary Daly go from here? Her next  book, dealing with the passions, is now in  manuscript form and could be on the shelves  within a year. 22 Kinesis April 83  ARTS  The True Story of Ida Johnson: an analysis  by Cy-Thea Sand  There was a* literary classic published by  the Women's Press in Toronto a few years  ago that too few readers know about.  It  is a particular gem for those of us who  love literature but have the impression .  that it is made by and for the upper  classes. The True Story of Ida Johnson by  Sharon Riis should be reprinted, studied  and celebrated. It is a working-class,  feminist and lesbian story which could be  too easily buried and forgotten.  The True Story of Ida Johnson is a short  but brilliant novel of a white woman's  struggle with economic and sexual oppression and the story of Lucy George, a Native Indian lesbian woman. Lucy and Ida's  lives intertwine, pulsating with a sensuality and spirituality reminiscent of Sula  and Nel's friendship in Toni Morrison's  Sula. The True Story of Ida Johnson is a  rare work of both native and working-class  consciousness - a novel that dramatizes  the oppression of racial, economic and  sexual disparity as well as the transformative power of female friendship.  Sharon Riis' style is non-linear. Beginnings and endings, realism and fact are  seen as illusion and truth simultaneously.  Riis' language is rich but sparse. There  is a dream-like quality to the work, yet  its concerns are deadly serious.  Ida Johnson marries when she is fourteen  years old and pregnant, a fate not uncommon for girls in Longview, Alberta in  the late fifties:  Derek Campbell's subjugation of  Ida was not deliberately harmful.  He thought he loved her and the  rest followed.  Ida has two children, spends her time  raising them, watching soap operas and  satisfying Derek's sexual demands. After  five or six years of this she turns the  gas on in their trailer, steps outside for  a cigarette and tosses the butt back into  her home where her husband and children  lie with their throats cut. Ida spends the  next few years travelling a bit, working  as a waitress and assistant cook to survive.  The novel's narrative structure increases  its emotional impact. Ida tells her story  to her childhood friend Lucy George who  poses as a young male hitchhiker named  Luke. S/He stops for coffee where Ida  works. S/He offers to pay Ida twenty bucks  just to have her talk and tell Luke her  life story. So Ida talks about her years  of waitressing in various places, about  being robbed in Vancouver (robbed of the  money she earned exploiting the exploitation of her as a "real" person, that is  poor, working class) and about the psuedo-.  intellectual who said he loved Ida for her  "colossal stupidity". Ida talks about her  marriage; her language is rugged and clear:  "You couldn't actually say I liked Derek  in the sense for instance of his creepy  personality but I loved him; we were truly  in love." We are not given narrative interpretations or even Ida's thoughts as  she moves towards the night of the murders.  The deed is done. Her guilt established by  her one word answer to her father's question about the murders years after the  fact.  Lucy George is a rare portrait in Canadian  literature. She is an authentic Indian  character who "...as a child understood  the inherent limitations of her circumstance. She was female, poor and Indian  in a male, material white world." Lucy's  character is as powerfully drawn as Ida's  although we learn less about her life.  There is only a hint at her close ties  with her powerful and loving mother, yet  Lucy has an internal strength powerful  enough to resist the racism of the white  school of her childhood:  That first day she came to school  she was skinny and dirty like you  wouldn't believe and everyone just  stared. Miss Bird asked if she had  lice right out loud and everyone  laughted including myself and old  Lucy just smiled and said "No,  actually.    Do you?"   She got the  strap for it alright but nobody  ever laughed at her again.  In a culture saturated with Christian  assumptions, Lucy George retains the wisdom and spiritual depth of her people.  One of the most intriguing qualities of  this novel is its spiritual richness.  Without explanation or detailed description, Riis presents us with a Native  Indian character who is true to her people's legends and myths of spiritual and  psychic transformations.*•  We are told  that Lucy was born on a certain day and  year and yet: "She'd been around a lot  longer than that of course but nobody knew  and she wasn't the sort who'd tell."  Riis' portrayal of a Canadian native woman  as a lesbian is a first in our literature  to my knowledge.3 Lucy leaves the hostile  racism of Longview and the hopelessness of  her Reserve and travels around working as  "a deckhand; a mother's, help, a casMex,,  a mavi& star, a cowboy,, a clown.-'' Lucy  poses as a man not only as Luke the hitchhiker in her attempt to reconnect with Ida,  but also for economic survival.  Lucy, meanwhile, sits resolutely  alone in a Munich beerhall.  It's  her night off from the Krazy Lady  cabaret where she has top billing  as Gregor the Georgian juggler.  The Germans think she 's a queer  little fellow.    They humour her  but she has no friends.   "There  goes Gregor," they laugh "He 's  so fast with his balls the ladies  can't get at them. "  continued from p. 21  where it would be impossible for a human to  fight them off.  • Those in fallout shelters in a bombed  city could not survive because the massive  fire storms following a blast would use up  all the available oxygen, including what's  in the shelter.  • Those in fallout shelters in rural areas  would have to stay in the shelters for  several weeks because of the intense radiation present in the air. When they did  come out, they would find no doctors,  hospitals or food. Water would be contaminated and very likely the ozone layer  would be destroyed, causing sunlight itself  to be lethal. SEISI  • Dr. Caldicott says that in various inter  views she's been called "overly emotional"  about the nuclear issue. Her reaction to  this is that nuclear warfare is an emotional issue, one of the survival of this  planet, of this world, and she appeals to  the emotional, nurturing side of women  to launch a campaign based on this emotion  throughout the world to actively fight the  Arms Race. She states that feminists have  an important role to play, and that we  have to move now or we won't be here much  longer.  If You Love This Planet is being shown frequently in Vancouver, by various anti-  nuclear groups and other organizations.  Check bulletin boards around town for information as to the showings. It's a very  important film.  Ultimately Lucy needs Ida's love and companionship and returns home in search of  her. Lucy reveals herself to Ida after Ida  finishes with her story and they continue  on together. The ending of this novel is  cryptic, suggestive both of lesbian love  and mystical revelation. Ida says to Lucy:  "You were too long coming back.  It 's pure  luck that I'm here at all.  I lost touch    '  more times than I can count."  The novel is radical in many ways.

There are suggestions throughout  the work that Ida and Lucy are psychically  connected: a mysterious birthday gift arrives for Ida, Lucy attends Ida's wedding  in disguise, Ida hears Lucy call her on the  night of the murders. The bond between a  native and white woman defies the racist ambiance of their culture. The fact that Ida  is working class is integral. Both women  are hemmed in, limited by their sex, race  and class. They both challenge the imposed  immobility in different but effective ways:  Ida murders her family, Lucy leaves the  Reserve. And the work strongly suggests  that the women need each other, that they  must be together to survive the loneliness  of the disenfranchised.  The novel does not end with the traditional  narrative resolution. Lucy and Ida must  keep moving - there is no real place of  stability for them. But there is love possible between them and Sharon Riis is visionary in evoking its magic. As a lesbian  couple they may survive. In not punishing  her protagonists - one for murder, one for  leaving her "place", both for embracing the  friendship between them as their salvation  - Riis transcends the traditional tendency  to punish woman-identified fictional characters. 4 The True Story of Ida Johnson is  a multi-layered masterpiece, not the least  of which is its advocacy of women's survival.

April 83 Kinesis 23  ARTS  Islands explores the mother/daughter dynamic  by Elizabeth Shackleford  Margaret Hollingsworth's one-act play  Islands was recently performed as part of  the New Play Centre's annual Du Maurier  Festival. Because of rather hostile reviews in local daily newspapers, attendance  remained poor throughout the run. Some of  the few fortunate enough to have seen it  had reactions that were anything but hostile.  The play is set in a roughly finished house  on a West Coast island. Muriel, the owner,  is being visited by her mother Rose, whom  she has presumably not seen for some time.  Conversation between the two women is  strained and difficult.  Rose seems to see Muriel as her failure, a  daughter who places too high a value on  work, who will never give her any grandchildren, whose valiant attempt to be independent is only evidence that she is  profoundly unhappy. Despite these problems,  Rose wants badly to be reconciled with  Muriel. At the very least, she wants the  two of them to give a show of compatability  for the sake of her fiancee, whose ferry  is expected to arrive shortly.  Muriel wants none of Rose's interference.  She values her independence and refuses to  compromise herself in any way, even for  the sake of appearances. She seems very  Fresh from the West Coast Women's Music  Festival where she braved the critical  audience of the open stage, Carol Weaver  recently packed the Arts Club Theatre  for her Vancouver debut concert.

An engaging artist in the folk idiom,  Carol's repertoire embraces the works  of such well-loved performers as Margie  Adam, Cris Williamson (is any women's  concert complete without "Song of the  Soul"?), Holly Near, and native South  American David Campbell, as well as a  goodly and vibrant selection of her own  writings.

Wliferzffi  unsentimental about the past and has come  to accept that it is her destiny to be  alone. Work on the farm is her form of relaxation.  The similarity between these two women is  that each has a strong need for the approval and understanding of the other, yet  'Ģneither is able to extend it. This dynamic  is a common one in mother-daughter relationships and Hollingsworth has done an  admirable job delineating it.  The play becomes more interesting still  with the entrance of Alii, Muriel's ex-  lover. In some ways Alii is Muriel's  opposite. Muriel is forward thinking, Alii  dwells on the past. Muriel is practical,  Alii is so impractical that she is dubbed  insane by her society.  Unlike Muriel, Alii does not need to  struggle for her independence; it is the  natural companion to her distinctive way  of looking at the world. Muriel has a serious approach to life, whereas Alii has a  humourous, somewhat noncommital one. She  laughs when a work or phrase strikes her as  funny and seems not to be inhibited by the  conventional use of language. She instantly  recognizes and shows no respect for the  facades which the other two women have  erected against each other. She also recognizes how alike Rose and Muriel are.  Muriel's apparent self-control slowly dissolves away under the influence of this  disruptive being.  She feels acutely uncomfortable being with her 'indiscreet'  former lover. Added to this is the  unresolved nature of the relationship:  Muriel considers it to be over, but Alii  stubbornly refers to the farm as her home.  Eventually, Alii discovers and begins to  play on Muriel's feelings of guilt. She  describes the inhumane treatment she had  been receiving at the public mental hospital in horrifying detail, while Muriel  becomes more and more anguished by the re  alization that she may have deserted Alii  when Alii needed her most.  Finally Muriel embraces Alii and blurts out  the truth about their relationship. The  great defensiveness with which she makes  this confession is in immense contrast to  Rose's smug pride at being engaged for a  second time. Rose slaps her daughter in  anger and Muriel leaves the house.  Rose and Alii have a stilted and somewhat  amusing dialogue once they are left on  their own. Alii tells lyric anecdotes about  her recent past. Rose frets about having  failed as a mother and worries about the  impression Muriel will make on her fiancee.  When he finally phones, Rose decides that  she must book Alii into a hotel before  picking him up.  Islands is an insightful look at the relationship of one woman to her mother and  her ex-lover. It is rich and humourous and  full of the kinds of things that most women could relate to. The characters are  authentic, their conflicts and the ways  they choose to deal with them are perhaps  too real.  Although the play stood up well on its  own, it does seem to end abruptly. This  hopefully indicates that Hollingsworth intends to write a sequel. Islands is itself  the sequel to Alii Alii Ohy another one-  act play which takes place on the evening  that Alii and Muriel split up. The first  play was a good introduction to Alii,  whereas Islands tells us more about Muriel.  The playwright who has given us such compelling characters and such an interesting  plot almost has a duty to let us know what  eventually becomes of Muriel and Alii.  The New Play Centre's production of Islands  was certainly also worthy of praise. The  makeshift quality of the set was more than  compensated for by the accomplished acting.  Patricia Ludwick, Doris Chillcott and Anna  Hagan took their direction from Kathleen  Weiss.  By Design distorts lesbians  by Catherine Kerr  When Claude Jutra's By Design was discussed  on the PBS televisiou show Sneak Previews,  the reviewers explained that the movie is  about a lesbian couple who want a baby  and who must inveigle a male acquaintance  into siring the child. A short clip of the  film disclosed the moment when the women  confess they had been trying to use this  man as a stud, and he, shocked, says "I  thought you cared about me." Helen, the  would-be mother, replies "I do care about  you. That's why it didn't worlc."  What clinches the male-mindedness of this  plot is that Helen's heterosexual choice  is an ass-grabbing photographer who is so  obsessed with his male prerogatives that  he cannot even pose a model without giving  a running sexual interpretation to her  postures (which, of course, he dictates).  If I described how the movie goes on to  depict a feminist social worker as a nervous flunky, and if I mentioned the total  male self-projection evident in the idea  that Helen must have an orgasm in order to  conceive, I would only be covering some of  the more obvious distortions in By Design.  But I'll have to admit that I stayed  through only about half of them.  I had heard that Jutra had excluded lesbian  sex from the film because he did not want  to approach the subject voyeuristically.  What, then, are we to make of ,the scene in  which the more statuesque of our "lesbians"  is sitting naked astride the thighs of one  male while her partner is lying pinned  under the toiling lardy torso of another?  I made it my cue to depart.  There is a pornographic tradition of films  that .invite you to view "lesbians" being  sexually aroused in environments dreamed  up by men. This whole movie is such an environment. The relationship of the women  is established only as a prop for male  preconceptions; it reveals nothing of the  emotional and erotic domain that women inhabit with one another.  There is a pornographic tradition  in films that invite you to view  lesbians' being sexually aroused  in environments dreamed up by  men. This whole movie is such an  environment.  No film that starts this badly can end well  so be warned: at least seventy minutes of  By Design was achieved by fitting certain  superficial lesbian possibilities around  the male delusion that even the creepiest  lecher on the block is fundamentally necessary to the fulfilment of a woman.  Around the time that PBS was reviewing By  Design I received a letter describing how  the Ministry of Communications is reviewing.  continued on p.   26 24 Kinesis April 83  LETTERS  Working class woman  addresses feminists  Dear Sisters,  I would like to address the subject of  being raised poor and female and how that  has been for me within the Women's Movement  I was born in Sarnia, Ontario in 1951.  When I was three years old my parents returned to their native home place in Co.  Donegal, Eire, to live on a small farm. I  have four sisters and five brothers. We  had "Sunday best" clothes which were usually  new, otherwise it was hand-me-downs for the  remaining days. My mother made us petticoats and sheets from cotton flour bags.  Each child had daily* chores to do before  and after school. I'd milk cows, wash  dishes, take in bags of turf for the fire  and carry heavy buckets of water from the  well. We had an outdoor (non-flush) toilet  about 200 yards from the house and used  grass to wipe our asses. I participated in  farming activities like herding sheep,  setting and gathering potatoes, making hay,  plus household tasks which included scrubbing a large cement floor on my hands and  knees weekly. Sometimes my_childhood feels  like I've lived in the slave era.  The school I attended had two teachers -  one took pupils from 5-9 years, the other  from 10-L4 years. I was the only girl in  my class with three boys. I lived in fear  of the teachers and I don't remember getting any intellectual stimulation throughout this period. One of my teachers spent  most of her day heating her ass against  the open fire whilst we sat frozen at our  desks. The other one spent much of his day  masturbating behind his high bench, (no  joke). If you got beaten at school by the  teacher you daren't tell your parents as  you would only get another beating from  them for being "bad" at school.  Next I went to the Technical School and  learned Commerce and Domestic Science. My  parents couldn't afford to send us to  Higher Education until it became free,  which the three youngest members of our  family were not able to avail themselves  of. After that I won a scholarship to a^  boarding school for one year. My education  complete in Eire, I had no option but to  become a human export and go to England  where I could train as a nurse and get paid  for it-(in Eire I would have had to pay  for the same training).  Some years later  I got sponsored to train as a social worker.  It was not until this period that I had to  confront a Library - that was so scary for  me. My book exposure was mainly restricted  to a few unimaginative text books throughout my school years and my parents never  bought any books for the family. Even  today my family's nearest town Letterkenny  which has a rural population of 8,000  people has a "Public Library" which consists of a small room lined with a few  old books.  So with the above background I first entered the Women's Movement in 1976 whilst  in London, England, through a women's consciousness raising group and Women's Aid  (an organisation for battered women).  Politically I didn't know the left from  the right, felt completely raw and terrified. It felt like I'd fall to pieces  everytime I ventured to open my mouth to  speak, and because I was so scared and  had so little information, I thought all  these other articulate women would think  I was stupid and even neurotic. They were  however good women and made special effort  to explain their jargon language and  treated me with respect.  I came to Vancouver, B.C. in March 1979,  lived with you until May last year when  I returned to live in Eire on a permanent  basis. Once in Canada I was eager to de  velop politically (having enough space  and distance away from Eire and England  seemed essential to me for this to happen).  To do this I embraced many facets of the  Women's Movement; worked within the B.C.  Organization to Fight Facism; joined a  study group within the Workers Communist  Party; as well as worked for a wage to  live on. May I add here that I have been  a single parent since 1973. My time with  you was well spent. It was lovely to explore my Canadian culture and yet treasure being Irish too.  O.K. so I wrote this poem that follows.  Struggling with the Bourgeois clique  within the Women's Movement  You have to be here, you have to be there  You have to make yourself visible everywhere  If you're seen around, then perhaps you're  sound  If you want to connect - get "politically  correct"  If you go to their dances, they'll watch  who you'll romance with  If you go to their meetings, you might  take some beatings  For if you speak out, it upsets their  bourgeois rut  And if you are quiet, they think you can't  fight  But I need some space away from this race  My body to nourish - my being to flourish  So if I'm away for more than a day  Don't you worry about that, for I'll soon  be back  I know my own track, so get off my back  Because the working class poor - knows  what to endure  When to move on and when they belong.  14/6/'81  It reflects my own experience within our  Women's Movement and my determination to  be united as sisters. The discomfort I  felt and the skills necessary to survive  as a woman worthy of recognition are blatantly obvious. My aim is not to evoke a  defensive response from individuals or  groups, but rather to stimulate safety for  other women (especially 3rd World; raised  poor and working class) to speak out and  share what it's like for you wanting to  enter or being involved and part of the  Women's Movement. The mental and/or physical abuse encountered by many of us especially as children made us victims of a  classist, sexist, racist and adultist society and climbing out of the fog in adulthood isn't easy for any of us. Many of us  shake and cry for hours alone or with  loved ones shedding the pain that was done  to us so as to develop sufficient strength  to speak out or even mumble at a meeting,  in the hope we will be heard and respected  by our sisters (and brothers). When we remain silent it is because we are frozen in  our fear, we are silently screaming for  your HELP.  Do chara (your friend),  Caitlin Ni Ghallchoir  "We ain't no CindereUas!"  Dear Kinesis:  The last issue of Kinesis we enjoyed - it  was great to see an issue about musicians  and artists in our community.  However the article "Cinderella's of Rock"  by Janie Newton-Moss and Joy Thompson we  were not so happy about.  We understand the intention behind the article to be a good one, but the research  job, particularly in regards to us, was so  poor that the facts about us were almost  entirely incorrect. Just for the record,  Naomi, who used to sing with us, has never  had anything to do with the band Magic  Dragon; our guitarist Elaine Stef is -not  playing with Junco Run (she did 2 gigs with  them and left the band months ago); Conny  Nowe, our drummer, is not "returning" to  Junco Run, but playing with them (she used  to play with some of the same people in a  band called Tin Twist, but that was years  ago). Annie Moss (Junco Run bass player and  singer) wasn't mentioned at all and she's  an excellent musician! Janet Lumb is not  playing with Ad Hoc - which doesn't exist  anymore. We are still called The Moral  Lepers, still playing together and neither  Marian Lydbrooke or Bonnie Williams are  "lost" to the local music scene.  This may seem like quibling, but if it's  worth writing about, you might as well get  it right.  We don't wish to put them down or harp on  about it, but we'd appreciate being contacted in future - all of us are around in  the community, and we'll be pleased to let  people know what's happening.  The Moral Lepers (we ain't no "CindereUas")  Positive feedback on  pap smear info  Kinesis:  I'd like to congratulate you for printing  the Health Collective's excellent insert,  "A Feminist Approach to Pap Smears." The  booklet provides vital information in a way  that is both accessible and de-mystifying,  enabling women to gain more knowledge, and .  thus power, over our own health concerns.  We have incorporated the insert into our  clinic volunteer training. The response has  be:en overwhelmingly positive.  Marcie Bell  Planned Parenthood Vancouver  Authors rebut  physician's criticism  Kinesis:  We are responding to Dr. Kirsten Emmott's  letter which appeared in the March issue  following our article on a feminist approach to Pap tests.  1. Because we wanted our information to  appear in a Kinesis supplement, space considerations necessitated cutting several  sections of the original text. The topic  of one of these sections was laser therapy.  We have been very interested in this treatment since, in the hands of a skillful  user, it seems to be very precise and this  may enable the abnormal tissue to be destroyed leaving healthy surrounding cells  intact. Our information on laser therapy  is in the files at the Women's Health  Collective. As "far as we are aware however,  laser therapy has not been available in  B.C. since 1981.  2. Robin's healing herstory was also  cut and details of her lesion were left  out. Regression because a punch biopsy  cuts out the lesion is possible if the  area of abnormal cells is very small.  Robin's lesion, however, was noted twice  by the specialist at colposopy to be an  "area of atypia surrounding the os, exy  tending into the endocervical canal."  Because of the extension into the os and  the large area of the lesion, cryosurgery  was ruled out. This was probably also part  of the reason the first specialist mentioned hysterectomy at the first colposcopy. At both colposcopies only one  biopsy was taken at 6 o'clock. Those  biopsies did not take very large sections  of the cervix so, it is unlikely that it  would have taken out a lesion which surrounded and extended into the cervical os.  3. We do not particularly feel reassured  about the effects of synthetic hormones by  the recent disclosure that not as many DES  daughters have gotten genital cancers as April 83 Kinesis 25  LETTERS  previously predicted. Two recent studies  have shown that male offspring have been  harmed more than expected, and that DES  daughers have a higher incidence of the  wart virus found on the cervix than other  women not exposed to the drug in the womb.  Perhaps the drug has weakened the cervical  cells making it easier for infection to  take hold. It seems obvious to us that  the vast case against the use of synthetic  estrogens will continue to escalate.  4. Lastly, we find some of Dr. Emmott's  attitudes to be typical of many doctors.  These doctors see their patients who take  their disease very seriously as showing  "extreme anxiety", while they suggest more  severe surgery for their "transient and  irresponsible" patients. We think that each  woman should be aware that the extent of  her disease may be "overcalled" so that in  the group of all women, there are fewer  that are "undercalled." That information  is not usually included with the recommendation for a particular surgical procedure.  Women need to demand accurate and complete  information around their medical treatment  and to make decisions individual to their  needs and circumstances. Contrary to Dr.  Emmott, we think that it is possible to  approach surgical treatment cautiously, use  natural healing, and be critical of the  health industry.  anyone else. Similarlily we can use humour  to help us recognize that our political  philosophies are (or should be) always  evolving and that the last word is not yet  in on anything.  Maybe if we can look at ourselves and our  cultural idiosyncracies with a bit more  humour and detachment, we might also be less  righteous and more gentle with each other.  How we go about the serious work of creating  a world based on more fair and humane social  and political arrangements then we have now  is enhanced by an understanding of the limits of any one sub-group, no matter how  noble its aspirations, the limits of time,  place and culture. We need this perspective  if we are to keep broadening our awareness  and making the necessary bridges and connections. Satirical humour can be a mirror  to our limitations and a vehicle for expanding our perspective.  Annette Clough  Robin Barnet and Rebecca Fox  D&C poses  genuine risks  Kinesis:  In her letter commenting on the article on  abnormal Pap smears which appeared in the  February Kinesis, Kirsten Emmott expresses  impatience with Robin's fear that she might  get PID from a diagnostic D&C. Kirsten  states..."(getting PID from a D&C, of which  the risk is probably one in two or three  thousand, if that) when it is a question of  diagnosing cancer!)"  Actually, the risk of getting PID from a  diagnostic D&C is from 0.3 to 0.5 percent;  in other words, from three to five women  develop PID in every group of one thousand  women undergoing diagnostic D&C. This figure is approximately ten times higher than  Kirsten guessed it would be.  Anyone who has ever had PID, or anyone who  has ever known a woman who has been disabled  from this serious disease, is fearful of  procedures which might lead to PID. Questioning the need for such procedures and  exploring alternatives before making a decision seems to me to be a wise and brave  way to deal with this fear in a nonemergency situation.  Maureen Leland Moore  Member of a Health Collective group  producing a booklet on PID  Humour appreciated  by local feminist  Kinesis:  I expect you will receive some criticism  for your "Survey of Feminist Culture"  in the March issue of Kinesis. I for one  got a lot of enjoyment out of it and thank  you for it. Besides providing some much  needed levity in these difficult times,  satire which is not vicious in its intent  also has a serious and useful purpose.  Humour can give us a valuable perspective  on our lifestyles and beleifs; it can help  us to see that the social rules and conventions we live by and hold so dear are  transitory and very particular to a generation, a culture, a geographical location,  and are by no means so refined and advanced  that they should necessarily be foisted on  Leave fashions to  the Vancouver Sun  Kinesis:  The special issue of Kinesis 1983 Women's  Day issue was certainly reflective of the  white women's movement today. CONSTIPATED.  An issue on fashion and culture is an insult to non-white women who are faced with  high unemployment in our communities, live  daily with the subtlety of Canadian racist  attitudes, (there is nothing else like it),  denied adequate childcare facilities, confined to living on reserves, confined to  ghettos, denied adequate housing, denied  (not even equal) job oppportunities,  denied an education that does not lie  about their herstory, denied the mobility  that this society allows people of white  I skin colour,...and the list can go on and  on...  How about an issue on WHITE PRIVILEGE IN  A LAND THAT WAS BUILT AND SURVIVES ON  PARASITISM. Let's leave fashions to the  Vancouver Stfti.  Carolyn Jerome  ®  %:    1   V  ^ IP* l*$-^^-4V  Conditions Cover graphic ©Irene Peslikis,  New York  Where were  the fat women?  Kinesis:  23% of the population is FAT. In Canada,  population 22 million, this means 5,060,000  people are FAT, of that 57% or 2,681,800  are Women. Although we comprise a healthy  percentage of the population, manufacturers  still refuse to produce clothing for us  unless they charge a Queen's ransom. NO  NEW CLOTHES, NO USED CLOTHES , NO FEMINIST  CLOTHES.  Where an average size woman may spend  approximately one hour buying an article  of clothing and perhaps another hour to  hem or alter the garment, FAT women spend  one hour buying material, patterns and  notions, then several more hours, cutting  sewing and fitting a garment to have  clothes at a comparable price. At that  patterns are not sized for FAT women,  simply enlarged so the fit is still not  a good one. As a FAT woman more of my  life is used up on basics that average  women take for granted, and sewing skills  are mandatory rather than optional.  In last issue's "Feminist Fashion" spread  you took a light hearted feminist poke at  the fashion industry and feminist fashion.  Of the 19 women shown only 1 comes close  to being described as FAT and my calculator tells me that 23% of 19 is 4.37.  I hypothesize several possible reasons  for the imbalance in this fashion spread:  (a) the photographer and Kinesis have not  embraced the fight against FAT PREJUDICE  as their own.  (b) they do not know 23% of the population.  (c) Kinesis considers FAT women not  Feminist, or not fashionable.  (d) at some near future date Kinesis plans  to publish an extensive report on FAT  Liberation, complete with photos of  BEAUTIFUL, FAT, ROBUST WOMEN.  In addition I noticed that women of colour,  disabled women, children and older women  were conspicuous by their absence. Could  it be that these women were not feminists  or perhaps not Fashionable.  I was quite mystified to find such an  article printed in the same issue as my  letter to the editor about a previous article containing FATISMS, where I clearly  pointed out that FAT women are denied  clothing, as well as medical care, employment and housing. I can only assume then  that the editors of Kinesis have some reason, other than ignorance or oversight,  for the exclusion of FAT women, and disabled women, women of colour, children and  older women. I would like to see this reason in print.  Bonnie H.

It is not possible in this society to be  a 'liberated' womyn without being in a  constant state of conflict and struggle.  However, if our conflict and struggle is  not guided by a consciousness of the magnitude of the problem, then our energies  will be misdirected and futile.  We do not want equality and equal pay in  this patriarchal society. We do not want  equal job opportunities to work in their  office towers, their lumber companies,  their nuclear power plants. We do not  want to be aggressive, competitive female  replicas of the men that rule this society.  We want to develop a feminist resistance'  movement that embraces a means of survival  that allows us to flourish and grow as  rich human beings living in harmony with  the earth.  The womyn's movement cannot be a one-issue  oriented struggle but must understand and  embrace the ecological struggle, indigenous  people's resistance, and anti-imperialist  liberation movements because the same  patriarchal institutions that perpetuate  our oppression also oppress the animals,  the indigenous peoples, the third world  peoples, and the earth.  The authorities plan to use the threat of  imprisonment to contain the development of  any forms of resistance that are not"State-  sanctioned. They believe that prisons will  be an effective deterrent to us, yet they  do not understand that the true spirit of  freedom cannot be subdued. We want people  to know that our physical freedom may be  limited but mentally, we remain free. Our  group unity is strong and individually we  are all politically dedicated to living  through this crap.  We feel strong solidarity with feminist  womyn who are dedicated to questioning  themselves for truth and who have the sensitivity and political consciousness to  never create power struggles and oppressive  orders again!

A recent federal commission has recommended  that all public money for films be delivered through the Canadian Film Development  Corporation.  The Development Corporation, according to  Studio D, has a.n abysmal record vis-a-vis  women: it does not fund women's projects;  it funds projects with no commitment to  the employment and/or training of women;  and it funds projects derogatory to women.  Claude Jutra's Canadian-made movie is perfectly timed to demonstrate this point and  to back up Joy Johnson of Studio D when she  says "The last mirror Canadians need is the  one that reflects a monolithic, singular,  masculinist, Hollywood-made-in-Canada view  of the world."  If someone is collecting dimes for The A  Woman Needs A Man Like A Fish Needs a  Bicycle Trophy for 1983, I'll give a dime  and nominate Claude Jutra in the film  category. But I'm saving my postage stamps  so I can write to Francix Fox on behalf of  Studio D. If I have spared you the expense  of a ticket to By Design, maybe you could  do the same.

Open letter  from Oakalla  Dear Kinesis:  On January 20, 1983, while we were travelling along the Squamish highway, we were  stopped by cops posing as highway flag-  persons. Seconds after the vehicle stopped,  at least 30 men in camo fatigues, armed to  the teeth with automatic rifles, shotguns,  large caliber handguns, and teargas, in  unison attacked the vehicle we were in.  All the cops were screaming hysterically  while they teargassed us, ripped us through  broken glass, and threw us on the ground.  It was horrible having to lay passive to  the whims of these crazed military extremists and their guns. We could imagine how  other womyn felt in other countries  especially being unarmed and having to  survive and accept the horror and death of  a military attack on their villages and  homes. The feeling is too extreme to explain. It suddenly becomes very clear  that these men with their guns are ready  to kill you.  What is happening in Canada today in reaction to the recent sabotage to the B.C.  Hydro Cheekye-Dunsmuir line and the fire-  bombings of the Red Hot Video porn outlets  is not unconnected to the political repression used against people resisting in  other parts of the world. In other countries where the liberation movements are  strong and active enough to threaten the  government and corporate interests, the  counter-insurgency forces respond instantly  with extreme violence. The ultimate weapon  of the people has always been militant  resistance and all police states are constantly developing their violent repressive apparatus to use against the people.  Being womyn-identified, politically conscious environmentalists and determined to  challenge the power and profit motives of  this patriarchal society that ensures the  rape and mutilation of our Mother Earth, we  refuse to accept their labels of us as  terrorists. We know that there are many  sisters who share our radical analysis of  the issues surrounding the charges we face.  For centuries the authorities have reacted  violently to womyn who resisted; they  used to brand us as "witches" and burn us,  now they label us "terrorists" and will  try to bury us in their cement tombs.  Since our arrests, we have felt a.responsibility to the womyn's community to outline why we feel the womyn's movement  must transform itself into a womyn's resistance movement that is capable of  smashing corporate patriarchy.  The world has almost always been dominated  by patriarchal societies but none so manifests the male qualities on all levels and  has stripped womyn of all value as the  modern industrial culture. It is the  historical epitome of patriarchy. Office  towers, cars, strip mines, and nuclear  arms are the physical tribute to MAN.  There is no balance in the corporate  industrialized world. There is no room  for sensitivity and sharing. The balance  is tipping over dangerously towards the .  nuclear precipice and extinction.  The capitalist economic system has become  so pervasive throughout society that its  relations and values of consumerism permeate all aspects of our lives. As a result of this, people have become blind  and incapable of experiencing the richness and depth of the natural world -  forests, mountains, water, animals, and  other humans.  The same institutions and values that  teach people to see trees as lumber,  mountains as mining resources, old people  as pensioners and children as unruly  trouble, teach us that womyn are sex objects. The rape of forests by lumbering  companies and the rape of womyn can ultimately be attributed to the same  criminals - the men who rule the industrial complex. The decision to designate  vast areas of the earth as "sacrifice  areas" in the name of industrial progress  and the decision to sacrifice the El  Salvadorean people in the name of "freedom", is made by the same womyn exploiters  in control of the multinational economy.
