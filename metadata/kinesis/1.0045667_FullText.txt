Yes, it was that  time again: Take Back the Night. We hear  there were boisterous crowds at every  event, and Kinesis plans to have some pictures, as well as a herstory of TBTN, in  our next issue (our special on violence  against women.) So if you've got some  photos, or some stories... give us a jingle.  What is a good Take Back the Night  event without the pie-requisite complaint  that it is "exclusionary." For example...  The Vancouver Sun published a letter  to the editor from a woman who identifies as an "ardent, lifelong feminist." She  wrote that she would not be attending the  event in Vancouver (and encouraged other  women to do the same) because men  weren't allowed to join in. Such a woman-  only march is "offensive, sexist and counter-productive." Not surprisingly, the Sun  picked hers as its letter of the day.  Wasn't Take Back the Night started  some twenty years ago to make the point  that a woman should be able to walk on  the streets at night, alone, without having  to have a man beside her to "protect" her?  This backlash against the work of the  feminist anti-violence movement underscores the lack of understanding of the  violence a lot of women face at the hands  of men. Until male violence against  women exists no more, "feminists" will  continue to Take Back the Night.  Speaking of backlash... Roger  Gallaway is back at it again. The co-chair  of the Joint Senate/House Committee on  Child Custody and Access was out talking up the report the Committee is set to  release at the end of November. Portions  of it were recently "leaked" to the media.  (Hey, why didn't Kinesis get a copy?!)  The contents and recommendations  in the Committee's report should be of no  surprise to anyone who followed the  Committee's cross-Canada "consultations." Right from the start of the (flawed)  process, Gallaway and fellow committee  cohort Anne Cools made it clear where  they stood on the issues. They have both  been very vocal in expressing their opinion (and that of the so-called fathers' rights  proponents) that the Divorce Act is "discriminates" against men.  The "Cools/Gallaway" report (because really it is their agenda) is based on  a premise that ordinarily it is in the best  interests of children to have both parents  actively involved in their lives. While there  appears to be some good recommendations  for women (and children)—such as abusers should not get access to their children  until they clean up their act—it's difficult  to trust that the intention of the Committee  is indeed to ensure the safety and well-being of children. We only need to recall that  Gallaway and Cools point to women as the  main abusers of children.  Another recommendation in the  leaked report is that anyone who makes  "false" (that is, unproven in a court of law,  and not necessarily "untrue") allegations  of abuse in custody battles should be subject to criminal charges. Gallaway has already publicly—and falsely (that is,  wrongly)—stated that 66 percent of the allegations of abuse brought into custody and  access disputes are false. Who are the perpetrators of these lies, according to  Gallaway? Women, of course.  As well, the Cools/Gallaway Committee recommends that unreasonable prevention of court-ordered access be made an  offense under the Divorce Act (our italics).  It's really critical that women challenge  the Minister of Justice Anne McLellan to  ensure any changes to the Divorce Act accurately reflect reality. We need to call on  the Liberal government to take leadership  on this issue; otherwise, a lot of women  could be in even greater danger.  Speaking of leadership... the activists  who were pepper sprayed and roughed up  by the RCMP during last November's  APEC Summit in Vancouver are calling into  account the leadership quality of Prime  Minister Jean Chretien. How much was  Chretien involved in directing the "security" measures taken by the RCMP? Inquiring minds want to know.  Of course, the other pressing question  is, how could Chretien not know the difference between the pepper you put on  your plate and the pepper police spray in  protesters' faces? Someone else in his government seems to be wise about the distinction, at least enough to introduce new legislation that would put small, 250ml bottles of pepper spray into the category of  "prohibited weapons." Apparently, the bill  has been drafted and is before the House.  We'll check further into that.  Back to APEC. Even though this year's  APEC meetings are being held in Kuala  Lumpur, Malaysia—and, "not in my  backyard"—we cannot be complacent. It is  Vancouver   Status   ofWomen  Our appreciation to the following supporters who became members, renewed their  memberships or subscriptions to Kinesis, or made donations during the month of August and September:  Caroline Embling * Sherrill Grace * Azra Kamrudin * Leslie Kenny * A.  MacPherson * Denise Nadeau * Denise Nereida * Cheryl Nash * Jan O'Brien * Edith  Thomas * Shelagh Wilson  A special thanks to our donors who give every month. Monthly donations assist  VSW in establishing a reliable funding base to carry out our programs, services and  Kinesis throughout the year. Thanks to:  Elisabeth Geller * Jody Gordon * Erin Graham * Barbara Lebrasseur * Valerie  Raoul * Sheilah Thompson  more critical than ever for us here in  Canada to continue challenging the corporate globalization agenda behind APEC,  particularly given the renewed push to pass  the MAI.  Needless to say, activists will be in KL  to hold the leaders of the 18 APEC nations  accountable for their political and economic  agendas. The Women's Forum is taking  place November 8-9, and the Asia-Pacific  People's Assembly will be held November  10-15. We'll have a report from Malaysia in  an upcoming issue.  Accountability is a key word these  days. Over the past year, government departments which provide some monies to  women's groups have changed their funding criteria to require more "accountability." So what happens when women's  groups try to hold the government accountable to the impact of the changes they  make? They get turned down for funding.  That's what happened when NAC applied  for a project grant from Status of Women  Canada to do an impact study on the  changes to SWC's Women's Program funding. (Don't forget that NAC already had its  grant proposal turned down after they refused to follow the new funding guidelines.)  Then there's an ad hoc coalition of  women's groups in the BC lower mainland  which applied (through the Vancouver Status of Women) for a grant to look at the  impact of the Ministry of Women's Equality's contract reform package. They were  turned down too. Accountability for some.  On women's economic situation, we  already know that many women get  shafted in this market capitalist system. In  response, a lot of women creating alternative economic structures, mostly at the local community level. In this issue, we profile a few coop ventures, and invite other  women involved in coops or CED projects  to let us know what you're all doing.  If you're interested in women and economic independence, you might be want  to go to a conference that's happening in  New Brunswick next year, September 1999.  The conference is called Women and Credit:  Past Practice, Present Priorities. It will be an  international event looking at issues related  to women's access to credit and assets, and  community development. For more information about the conference, contact  Beverly Lemire, Department of History,  University of New Brunswick at telephone:  (506) 453-4621 or email: lemire@unb.ca  On immigration: the Campaign to Defend Immigrants and Refugees in Canada  is putting out an urgent call to help "stop  the violence against immigrant and refugee women." The groups endorsing the  campaign say "new proposals" for changes  to the Canada's Immigration Act will further entrench the "sexist, racist, anti-working class criteria" used in determining who  can claim immigrant or refugee status in  Canada.  If the new proposals are adopted, anyone who commits a "non-political crime"  in their country of origin would be denied  refugee status because they present a "harm  and danger" to Canada. In understanding  what this means, it's necessary to remember that the country of origin defines  "criminal." For example, campaign organizers say that each year, 100,000 women in  Iran are arrested for the "crime" of disobeying Islamic law.  The federal government wants to table new legislation by the end of the year.  The Canadian govenment has already announced that 16,000 refugee claimants,  many of whom are women, will be deported back to their country of origin, according to the campaign organizers. For  more on the campaign, call (604) 318-6579.  Hey, one final note. In case you were  wondering, yes, there's going to be a sequel to last year's "Trick or Treaty" The  march and rally, organized by the United  Native Nations (which represents off-  reseve Aboriginal people in BC), is held to  challenge the current treaty-making process happening in the province. The date is  October 31, Hallowe'en. Other details of the  event are still being worked out, so for more  information call the United Native Nations  at (604) 688-1821.  In sisterhood and solidarity.  It's Fall, and inside Kinesis we're going on a retreat (outside of Kinesis). A  groups of us are heading for ...the West End  to do a bit of visioning. We're going to  brainstorm about some things we'd like to  do in celebrating 25 years of publishing  Canada's national feminist newspaper.  Content, design, 25th anniversary  paraphenalia, promotional campaigns, the  anniversary benefit and ball..these will all  be topics of discussion. We'll certainly to  take into account the various comments  we've received from our readers over the  years, and we invite more of your input.  Call, mail, fax or email us.  We finally did it. For several years now,  we've been talking about the need to restructure the part-time staff jobs at Kinesis  to best fit our needs in this PageMaker/  Photoshop world.  So first, we'd like to thank two women  who have contributed greatly to the production of Kinesis. Sur Mehat worked at  Kinesis tor more than five years, as the typesetter and later as the advertising coordinator as well. Her talents at last minute back  pages are second to none. Take care, Sur.  And we also thank marilyn lemon who  skillfully handled the task of designing Kz-  nesis. She also took on all our crazy computer problems, and for that we are forever  grateful. Remember the fan, marilyn.  This month, we welcome Jenn Lo and  Amal Rana to Kinesis: Jenn as the Marketing Coordinator and Designer and Amal as  the Production Coordinator. Amal's job will  be coordinating—and seeking out— volunteers. (So stay by your phones!)  What can we tell you about them...  They both recently moved to the big city—  Jenn from Prince George and Amal from  Victoria. They both drive trucks. And they  both added lots of fun in the production  room this month (even though Jenn  couldn't understand any jokes after 10pm.)  We'll tell you more about them in our next  issue... when we get more gossip. In the  meantime, Amal and Jenn... we're glad  you're here.  This issue, we have lots of new writers. Thanks and welcome to Maria  Hudspith, Debbie Singh, Lynn Farrales,  Amal Rana, Ivy Zhu, Valerie Overend,  Pamela Lafayette-Robinson, and Leslie  Timmons. Also a big welcome to Tanja Stein  who was a big help during production.  That's it for now. We'll let you know  how our retreat goes next month.  OCTOBER 1998 News  Women and HIV/AIDS in Canada:  A dangerous victory  by Agnes Huang  How should society deal with individuals who know they are HTV positive  (HIV+) but still engage in unprotected  sexual acts? Rather than shed light on that  question, the Supreme Court of Canada  (SCC) only added further confusion and  potentially opened up the floodgates.  Last month, the SCC issued its ruling  in the case of Henri Gerard Cuerrier, a  Squamish, British Columbia man charged  with two counts of aggravated assault.  Cuerrier knew he was HTV+. Nevertheless,  he had unprotected sex with two women  more than 100 times between 1992 and 1994.  When he first tested positive, Cuerrier was  told by a public health nurse to disdose his HTV  status to his sexual partners and to practise  safe sex. He did neither. In fact, he told one  woman he was not HTV+ when she questioned  him, and he told the other woman he had  tested negative.  At the crux of the charges against  Cuerrier is whether his failure to disclose  his HIV status constitutes "fraud," and,  therefore, whether his failure to disclose  negates any "consent" to have unprotected  sex with him the women may have given.  In the absence of consent, sexual intercourse  amounts to sexual assault, a criminal  offense.  The BC Supreme Court acquitted  Cuerrier primarily on the grounds that the  legal definitions of fraud are not developed  enough to encompass the issues raised in  his case. The BC Court of Appeal upheld  that decision.  The task before the Supreme Court of  Canada was to clarify what "fraud" means  Women and HIV/AIDS:  The fear of  violence  by Maria Hudspith  Male violence against HIV-positive  (HIV-i-) women may affect women's access  to the medical treatment and emotional  support they need, as well as add to the  stresses that impact on their ability to take  care of their own health.  For many women living with violence  from partners or ex-partners, HIV is often  just one more thing to deal with—survival  becomes more about taking care of broken  bones, bruises and emotional wounds than  about cell counts, viral load or combination therapies. In many cases, HTV+ women  die from violent assaults, not from HTV disease.  Battering is the single largest cause of  injury to women. Twenty-two to 55 percent  of women seeking help in hospital emergency rooms are there because of domestic  violence. The fear of contracting or having  HTV/AIDS sometimes becomes yet another  tool by which men exert power and control in abusive relationships.  This happens and impacts on women  in a number of ways:  • A woman's partner may refuse to use a  condom or other protection when having  sex.  • When a woman is diagnosed HIV+, her  partner may blame her for contracting the  virus from someone else.  • Her partner may make her feel ashamed  and "dirty" because of her HIV status. This  may be one of the many ways her partner  may try to isolate her from the support she  needs.  • Her partner may threaten to disclose her  HIV status to others.  • Her partner may withhold financial support, child support, medication expenses  and control her mobility.  • A woman may neglect her own health  because of her need to focus on her emotional and physical safety. She may avoid  going to the doctor for fear of judgement  or fear of others discovering the violence.  • An HIV+ woman may be afraid to leave  her partner because she may feel unable to  support herself or her children because of  her HIV status.  • An HTV+ woman may be forced to work  the streets to make money for her partner's  and/or her own drug habit. This puts her  at greater risk for contracting sexually  transmitted diseases and other conditions  that may further compromise her health. It  also puts her at greater risk for violence,  rape and murder by other men.  While the link between childhood  sexual abuse and risk of HIV infection has  been well documented, there has been little research into the links between violence  against women, HIV and the impact on  women's health.  In a study of women consecutively  using the Women and Children's HIV program at Cook County Hospital in Chicago,  87 percent reported being or having been  in abusive relationships.  This article is reprinted from the Spring  1998 issue of Making Waves, the newsletter  of the Battered Women's Support Services.  Maria Huspith is a community outreach  worker with the Oak Tree Clinic and Positive  Women's Netivorkin Vancouver.  in the context of sexual assault legislation,  and whether failure to disclose one's positive HTV status is fraudulent.  In the end, the seven justices agreed  that failure to disclose should be subject to  some criminal sanctions, and ordered a  new trial for Cuerrier. However, the seven  judges were divided when it came down  to defining what constitutes "fraud." Three  sets of reasons were issued, and all three  greatly differed from each other.  Justice Peter Cory, writing for the majority of judges, ruled that "without disclosure there cannot be a true consent." He  added that it didn't matter that the two  women did not contract HTV from Cuerrier.  The mere fact that he put the women at  "significant risk of serious bodily harm" is  enough to warrant criminal sanctions.  Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dube offered  an even broader definition of fraud, saying that fraud occurs when a person acts  dishonestly—in general, and not related only to  the disdosure of HTV status—which induces another person to consent to a physical act.  She added that the physical act itself does  not have to be "particularly risk and dan-  gerouc" in order to label the dishonest act  fraudulent.  Justice Beverly McLachlin, writing for  herself and Justice Charles Gonthier, presented the narrowest criteria, saying that  the criminal law should apply "only to  those who deceive their partners about venereal disease with a high risk of infection  or harm." She suggests that minimal tinkering be done to existing laws to account  for these circumstances.  Joan Grant-Cummings, president of  the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, calls the Supreme Court decision a "dangerous victory."  "As a health activist, I recognize there's  a privacy piece and a women's rights piece  to this issue," says Grant-Cummings. "We  don't want the court to be ruling on privacy issues, but we want the court to give  relief to women whose lives are put at risk."  The issue of mandatory disclosure is  very complex, Janet Madsen of the Positive  Women's Network in Vancouver concurs.  While she supports women who want to  press charges against male partners who  did not disclose their positive HIV status,  she worries about the potential backlash  against women from the Supreme Court  decision.  "One of the issues for us as an agency  which provides support to women whether  they are HTV+ or not, is the necessity to recognize that mandatory disclosure presumes an equal partnership in terms of con-  sensual or non-consensual sex," says  Madsen. "Between men and women, more  often than not, there isn't an equal partner  ship in terms of power, decision-making  and safety to disclose."  Madsen also points to the connection  between violence and disclosure [see article this page.] "Many women are at risk of  violence if they disclose to their partners—  they can be accused of being unfaithful. If  they are women working in the sex trade  and they disclose, they risk violence or losing their lives."  There is also concern that the SCC's decision could be used as a way to "clean up"  sex trade workers, whether they were HIV  positive or not. Women already subject to  discrimination and harassment could face  even further sanctions.  For many TflV-i- women, the fear that  their status will be disclosed to their  broader community is real. "A lot of  women say that, upon disclosure, they and  their children have lost friends, they've had  their custody challenged, and family members have responded by withdrawing,"  says Madsen. "Disclosure always brings  loss, and there's much more to lose than  just the immediate relationship with a potential partner."  On top of all that, many people working in  theHIV/AIDS service sector are very worried that  the SCC decision will have huge ramifications  outside the realm of sexual relations. In particular, there is concern that some overly vigilant  authority will apply the decision further to catch  a much wider range of cases, says Ken Smith,  the lawyer who represented the BC Persons with  AIDS Sodety when the Cuerrier case was heard  at the BC Court of Appeal.  "Taking the broadest interpretation of Justice Cory's reasons could mean that where you  have a situation that isn't otherwise illegal, failure to disclose is a fraudulent ad, which makes  [the situation] illegal," says Smith.  That, says Madsen, opens up the possibility of the SCC ruling being applied to  doctors, dentists, school children, daycare  workers...to anybody in a social context. "If  non-disclosure of HTV is defined as a criminal offense, then could the law be interpreted to include other kinds of diseases,  or even something as simple as a cold?"  suggests Madsen. "It's a ridiculous example, and yet, it could be applied as such. Where  will the line be drawn."  The Supreme Court seems to have passed  back to Parliament the question of what to do  about the small percentage of cases where people  do consciously decide to infect other people,  says Grant-Cummings. Many would argue that  using the Criminal Code is not the solution. 'If s  too blunt an instrument to catch the irresponsible people," says Smith  The Department of Justice says it is reviewing the SCC decision and examining  what the impact of each set of reasons  would be.  OCTOBER 1998 News  Labour relations in Canada:  Union versus union  by Agnes Huang  Unionized workers on strike against  their union employer. That's the situation  outside the British Columbia Teachers' Federation (BCTF) building in Vancouver. Since  Friday, September 18, members of the Union of Teacher's Federation Employees  (UTFE) have been walking the picket line.  The 120 UTFE members—the support  staff and technical workers at the BCTF (the  union that represents teachers)—have been  without a collective agreement since July  1,1997. While there had been various round  of bargaining talks last Fall and Spring,  negotiations reached an impasse by May.  On the morning of the union's strike  deadline, UTFE and BCTF negotiators came  up with an Agreement in Committee (AIC).  In the AIC, BCTF offered its employees a  four-and-a-half percent salary increase over  four years, bridging language, and four  extra days of holiday at Christmas. [Bridging language ensures that the terms and conditions of an expired collective agreement remain in force until a new agreement is reached.  There was no bridging language in the UTFE/  BCTF collective agreement.] UTFE's bargaining committee took the AIC back to union  members for a ratification vote.  UTFE members continued their walk  out, partly because of provocative action  taken by management. "At 5:15pm Thursday evening, BCTF changed the access  codes to the building to restrict entry," says  Bev Humphries, president of UTFE. "Essentially, they 'locked out' our members."  BCTF's version of the events is that,  with a strike looming, management was  only taking pre-cautionary measures to secure the millions of dollars of equipment  inside the building.  At 4:00pm Sunday, votes were counted  and 63 percent of UTFE members had rejected the AIC.  UTFE says its members will not settle  the labour dispute unless they receive three  things: restitution for measures management instituted in mid-June; the reinstatement of one employee to her previous position; and reasonable protection for term  employees. Humphries says her members  have already compromised in areas such  as wages, term of contract, bridging language and discipline, but they remain adamant about the three outstanding issues,  particularly given the chain of events leading up to the strike.  At the end of May, contract negotiations were going nowhere and the union  took limited job action. UTFE says the job  action was enough to interfere with BCTF's  activities, but did not significantly affect its  operations. The stopped faxing, photocopying and dealing with couriers, placed a ban  on doing overtime, and took their breaks  at the scheduled time [rather than being  flexible to the work situation.] After six  days, the job action was stopped when the  two parties agreed to a mediation date.  Then, in an unexpected turn, BCTF  threw down the gauntlet. On June 17, management cancelled the former collective  agreement and revoked many of the provisions contained in that contract. BCTF:  • placed a ban on union activity in the  workplace;  • increased the work hours [UTFE had negotiated a shorter work week during summer months;]  • effectively locked-out casual (on-call)  employees;  • cancelled most paid leaves; and  • refused to pay out accrued overtime or  allow time off in lieu.  Kathy Powell is one employee affected  by BCTF's decision not to allow discretionary paid leave, which is used primarily to  deal with personal matters such as emergencies, childcare and medical appointments. Powell, who has worked at BCTF  for 26 years, was denied bereavement leave  after a close family member passed away  suddenly. She ended up having to take part  payback [to UTFE members] because it  would imply that BCTF did not act within  our legal rights, and we did."  UTFE has filed an unfair labour practice complaint against the BCTF with the  Labour Relations Board (LRB). Rands says  there is precedent to support the union's  position that BCTF acted in bad faith. She  points to a similar situation involving  teachers in Mission, BC, where the LRB  ruled that an employer cannot arbitrarily  change the terms and conditions of the collective agreement when it has expired, unless those changes are related to the employer's position at the bargaining table.  Rands says BCTF would be shooting  its own self in the foot if the LRB rules in  UTFE workers on strike outside BCTF  of her vacation leave to deal with the family stress and the funeral.  Powell says she is fortunate to have a  significant amount of vacation time. Some  of her colleagues aren't as fortunate and  have had to take unpaid leave to deal with  outside matters.  One member whose car broke down  arrived 20 minutes late for work and was  docked half-a-day's pay. Other members  who have requested time off for medical  appointments, even as little as 30 minutes,  were told to use vacation time or leave without pay  For UTFE, the crux of the continuing  labour dispute is the disrespect BCTF has  shown them. "Their actions have been totally unreasonable; it's a way to intimidate  us," says Powell. "We did six days of limited job action with minimal impact.  BCTF's retaliation has been much greater  than the inconvenience we caused them."  UTFE wants compensation for the  measures taken by BCTF. Jean Rands, a  member of UTFE's bargaining committee,  says the employer's actions were not about  strengthening its bargaining position.  "BCTF wasn't initiating changes it wanted  in the collective agreement. Rather, BCTF  was punishing us."  From management's perspective,  Krieger holds that BCTF acted within its  legal rights. He says BCTF was just responding to UTFE. "When UTFE took a  strike vote and job action in May, it no  longer had a collective agreement and  therefore BCTF was no longer bound to its  provisions," says Krieger. "There will be no  its favour. "If BCTF is successful in this case,  it will make the labour law worse for all  unions in BC, including teachers."  Karen Kilbride, a teacher and chairperson of the Status of Women Committee  (SWC) in Surrey, says she is shocked that  BCTF would respond to the union's job  action in this way. "We wouldn't expect that  from our school boards," says Kilbride. "It  makes reaching an agreement really difficult when the employer takes this kind of  action while negotiations are still going on."  Many teachers and members of ASU,  the union representing non-teaching administrative staff at BCTF, have voiced their  support for UTFE. "We're extremely disappointed with this executive," says Kilbride.  "UTFE staff are very crucial to the running  of our union. It's really unfortunate that a  union isn't able to negotiate fairly with its  own employees."  Since province-wide collective bargaining was put in place a few years ago,  teachers in local school districts became  more greatly affected by what was happening within the walls of BCTF "Our members who are just going on salary indemnity [sick leave pay through the insurance  plan,] won't be able to have their claims  processed because that's all done through  BCTF," says Kilbride  Another sticking point in the stalled  negotiations is the status of a long-time  employee. The woman succumbed to stress  during the dispute and resigned her position. She almost immediately asked to rescind her resignation, and was refused. Instead, management offered her a tempo  rary, two-month position at a lower salary  grade, and only on condition that she sign  away her right to file a grievance.  The union is not prepared to settle the  labour dispute unless the woman is reinstated to her old job or a comparable position within BCTF. "We will not allow her  to be the one person punished for her part  in the dispute," says Rands.  BCTF president Krieger would not  speak on the issue because it is a personnel  matter, but he did say that BCTF was willing to discuss the issue with the union at a  later date, just not at the collective bargaining table.  The final demand the union will not  budge on is a provision giving term employees the right to maintain their seniority level for one year after their contract  expires.  BCTF says it cannot support such a  provision because it would blur the distinction between term and continuing employees, and makes things difficult for the employer. Krieger adds that the union's demand is unreasonable. "UTFE is asking for  something that no other collective agreement has."  However, Rands says what the union  is asking for is not unheard of. "Lots of collective agreements have provisions where  people who do temporary assignments go  on a casual list." The union has even compromised on its original demand, and now  is only asking that the provision apply to  term employees with two years' seniority.  Rands doesn't understand why BCTF  is so reluctant to grant this provision.  "They've agreed to these rights for casual  employees, so it's not a stretch to apply  them to long-term temporary employees."  Lately, Karen Kilbride points out, BCTF  has not had a good track record with its  female members and employees. At the last  AGM, the executive put forward a resolution to collapse the Status of Women Committee (SWC), which had been in existence  for 25 years, into a broader Social Justice  Committee. The motion passed.  "It's ironic that BCTF got rid of the provincial Status of Women Committee (SWC)  in March, and in September its employees—most of whom are women—go on  strike," says Kilbride. She adds that the  feminist caucus within the BCTF is now  organizing support to try and get the provincial SWC reinstated at the next AGM.  Back on the picket lines, Rands says she  is disappointed in how the BCTF is handling the situation. "It's really unfortunate  that a union in its role as employer would  lose sight of the interests of even its own  members and take such an anti-union position."  However, she is optimistic both parties  will soon be getting back to the bargaining  table. "We think more and more teachers  are putting pressure on the BCTF, so we are  hopeful the situation will be resolved."  In the meantime, UTFE members are  set to vote on whether or not to merge with  another, bigger union. They are considering joining the International Woodworkers  Association or the CanadianAutoworkers.  The vote will be held September 30.  OCTOBER 1998 News  Aboriginal women in Canada:  Bill C-31 still discriminates  by Fay Blaney  Despite the heroic struggles of such  Aboriginal women as Mary Two Axe Early,  Jeanette Lavell, Sandra Lovelace and the  Tobique women [from New Brunswick] in  the 70s and 80s, sexist discrimination still  continues under Canada's Indian Act.  These women brought the disenfranchise-  ment issue, Section 12(l)(b) of the Indian  Act, to the women's movement, to the Supreme Court of Canada and to the United  Nations Human Rights Commission. [Under Section 12(l)(b), Aboriginal women lost  their "status" when they married non-Native  men.]  The result of their struggle was the  enactment of Bill C-31 in 1985, which  amended the Indian Act.  Although Bill C-31 allowed the reinstatement of thousands of women and children who had lost status under the previous discriminatory law, the amendment  brought in a whole new set of ways to discriminate against them. In fact, Aboriginal  leaders are now recognizing that Bill C-31  is merely the realization of the termination  policy Jean Chretien was proposing with  his 1969 White Paper Policy [Chretien was  Minister of Indian Affairs at the time].  The Native Women's Association of  Canada is doing work on this issue, and  what they have found is that under current  Bill C-31 registration procedures, many  First Nations communities are headed for  extinction. This is not to say that the membership of these bands will die off, but that  eventually all members will lose their status and all rights associated with it.  According to Elizabeth Hall, an employee working in the Family Reunification  Program at the United Native Nations—an  organization which represents off-reserve  Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia—  the registration process is so convoluted  and uncoordinated that people going  through it often either give up before they  have attained the status which is rightfully  theirs or accept a lesser degree of status than  they are entitled to.  Add to this that the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) is more than happy to  see the termination of status, little effort is  made to inform applicants of what they are  entitled to. The result is that even 13 years  after the passage of Bill C-31, there are still  large numbers of women and children who  have not been reinstated.  The old version of the Indian Act had  just two categories—status and non-status  Indians. Bill C-31 created several different  categories, which include status with or  without membership. And because membership codes fall under the purview of  band councils, some people can have membership with or without status.  Discrimination continues to be a central feature in the lives of women and children affected by this section of the Indian  Act. This injustice takes the form of inequitable distribution of resources, more particularly the lack of programs and services  to address this issue. Those attempting to  negotiate their way through the tangle of  red tape to have their status reinstated need  advocates and other service providers to  walk them through it. Those who throw up  their arms in frustration need to know that  giving up adversely affects their children  and grandchildren.  The worst insult is that sexual disrimi-  nation still exists within Bill C-31—the primary issue that Aboriginal women were  trying to address in pressing for this  amendment. Women are responsible for  registering children for status and part of  this process includes proving paternity and  providing evidence of the type of status the  father has.  If a father is unwilling to sign a sworn  affidavit stating that he is the father, or if  the mother is unwilling to disclose the paternity of her child, then DIA automatically  registers the child as having one non-status parent. This puts the child in the Section 6(2) category mhbh^bbmm  and there leaves her /  him unable to pass  on status.  Another blatant >  injustice has been the :'  lack of documented  information on the ;''<  affect Bill C-31 has on  women and children.  For example, how  many have been able  to return to their  homelands? What  has the experience of  returning home been  like? Are they treated , ;  the same or differ- V;  ently than band !  members who are ;  not Bill C-31s? How '  many are still in urban areas? What support provisions are  made at each level of government, including First Nations band councils, for Aboriginal women and children in urban areas?  While many of us know the answer to  these questions, our knowledge and experience is in isolation of each other. There  are numerous gaps in DIA policies and  practices, but the responses of individuals  and Aboriginal agencies are uncoordinated.  Without accurate and adequate documentation, Aboriginal women's groups have no  leverage when it comes to participation at  a policy level or in trying to access funding.  The Aboriginal Women's Action Network (AWAN) has taken on the challenge  of documenting the effects of Bill C-31. The  project has received funding support from  the Status of Women Canada.  Because we understand all too well the  experience of being kept outside of the decision-making process, we have designed  a model of research that is community-  based and inclusive. The tentative date for  our "Consultations Conference" is November 21 and 22. Participants of this conference will be Aboriginal women from various parts of British Columbia who will  spend a weekend exploring Bill C-31 issues,  learning interview and research methods,  and then formulating the questions this research will address. These women will then  return to their communities and each will  rPFsi  conduct interviews with five women affected by Bill C-31.  AWAN is currently conducting a literature review so that when conference participants arrive each will be aware of all that  has been written on Bill C-31. This should  help determine what direction our research  should take.  One of AWAN's goals is to publish a  book of the stories of the women interviewed for this project. Another goal is to  have the conference, as well as some of the  interviews, filmed for educational and political use. When the interviews are completed, a researcher will then analyze the  data and write a final report, which will be  used as a tool for political lobbying.  , Statistics from  various sources indicate that the majority  of off-reserve status  \N Aboriginal peoples  > are women. And  v AWAN members  who are active in the  Vancouver area understand the frustrates tion of having our  k| \ people be the majority of clients and recipients of non-Aboriginal programs and  services while we  v have no effective participation in the deci-  V sion-making process  \ of these agencies and  organizations.  The problem lies  in the way funding  formulas are devised  and this is where change is essential. However, the larger problem lies with the undemocratic processes inherent in the nonprofit societies acts, in the Indian Act, and  other laws which serve to exclude and silence Aboriginal women.  Since we live in urban areas, we believe  that the provincial ministries of women's  equality and aboriginal affairs have some  responsibility for Aboriginal women. And  since we have status, DIA also should honour its fiduciary obligation to us, whether  we live on or off reserve. Yet none of these  levels of government are prepared to address our needs nor heed our voices.  AWAN's Bill C-31 study will be an incremental step in the struggle of Aboriginal women to free ourselves from the grips  of these many forms of marginalization.  Those with status fall into several  categories as well.  The most important  feature is that only  some "status Indians"—that is, those  reinstated under  Section 6(1)—have  the capacity to pass  on status to their  children.Those registered as Section  6(2) "status Indians"  cannot pass on status. Further still,  there are even more  categories under  Sections 6(1) and  6(2).  If any individuals or groups are able to  lend support or donate funds to AWAN for this  research, call (604) 255-0704 or 879-0894 or  820-8948. Faxes can be sent to (604) 255-0724  or 820-8945. AWAN needs help with compiling resources for the literature review, as well  as volunteers for our conference, in-kind donations for mail-outs and photo copying, facilities for workshops, audio tape recorders and  tapes, and help transcribing the taped interviews.

A few months ago, the CWMA received 170 boxes of briefs, policy papers,  newsletters, minutes, and lobby notes from  the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, an umbrella organization of  more than 650 women's groups across the  country.  Over the summer, a research student  undertake the enormous task of sorting  through the volumes of documents accumulated by NAC between 1972 to 1992. She  indexed all the materials, arranging them  all into nine categories.  The NAC papers add to the growing  collection of printed documents from women's groups across the country in the Archives, founded in 1977 and located in the  Special Collections Library at the University of Ottawa. A listing of what is held  within the walls of the CWMA can be found  in The Canadian Women's Movement Archives: a Guide to our Archival Records published in 1992 by ECW Press, and on the  Archives website at: http://  www.uottawa.ca\library\cwma.html.  Andrea Trudel, coordinator of the Archives, says that what is unique about the  CWMA is that it is based on principles different from traditional archives. The goals  of the CWMA, she says, are to ensure that  materials are accessible and that they are  organized around women's groups, rather  than around individual collectors. CWMA  preserves a critical record of the Canadian  women's movement, and also provides students with valuable work experience.

New client rights  handbook  A new resource booklet on the rights  of people using therapy and counselling  services has recently been produced by  three feminist groups in Ontario.  Client Rights in Psychotherapy and  Counselling was put together by FACE  (Feminist Advocates for Counselling Ethics), the Toronto Rape Crisis Centre/  Multicultural Women Against Rape, Toronto (TRCC/MWAR), and the Women's  Counselling Referral and Education Centre (WCREC).  The handbook addresses such issues  as what constitutes violation of client rights  and options for challenging a therapist; and  talks about how to interview and evaluate  a therapist, including a review of the signs  of ethical therapy.  The section on "Client Rights Violation" includes the following items: your  rights in a process of complaint, how and  why therapists violate clients, warning  signs of violation, impact of violation on  clients and communities, why clients may  not be supported, and options for challenging a therapist/legal action.  The book can be picked up for free at  any of the three organizations. For copies  to be mailed, the organizations are asking  for a donation of $2 for shipping and handling per handbook.  Cheques should be made payable to Client Rights Project and sent to WCREC, 525  Bloor St West, 2nd Fl, Toronto, Ontario, M5S  1Y4. For more information on the handbook,  contact FACE by email at ethics@istar.ca, or  the TRCC/MWAR by email at trcc@web.net.  Asian lesbian conference  From December 4 to 6, the Philippines  will host the 4th Asian Lesbian Network  (ALN) Conference in Quezon City. With the  theme, "Our Voice, Our Choice," the  conference is envisaged to bring together  Asian lesbians for three days of political  discussion, cultural exchange, mutual solidarity and celebration.  The conference also intends to hold the  ratification of the ALN Constitution, a step  towards the formalization and consolidation of the ALN as an organization.  The 4th ALN Conference is being organized by Can't Live In the Closet (CLIC)  Inc, the GROUP Inc, and the Womyn Supporting Womyn Center (WSWC).  The conference will begin with an  opening ceremony and the presentation of  country reports. The second day will be  devoted to workshop discussions and  panel presentations.  The workshop topics planned are:  Identity and Lesbian Existence (coming out,  visibility, relationships, language, labels);  Health, Sexuality and Reproductive Rights;  Culture, Religion and Education (how these  social structures regard, oppress or recognize our lesbian existence); Politics, State  and the Law (looking at the current political and economic changes inAsia and how  these have an impact on our lesbian existence); and, Activism and Lesbian Rights  Advocacy (the state of our activist involvement, gains and losses, challenges).  The fee to attend the conference is  US$50, which includes food and conference  materials, but not travel and accomodation  expenses. Currently, the organizers are exploring possibilities for scholarships,  whether full or partial. Priority will be  given to participants who have not previously attended any of the ALN conferences,  and only Asian lesbians living and working in Asia will be considered.  Anyone interested in present a paper  or conducting a workshop (on the above  topics or another topic), should contact the  conference organizers no later than the end  of October.

Montreal Health  Press celebrates 30  In 1968, when the distribution of information about contraception was illegal, a  brave group of students from McGill University produced the first Birth Control  Handbook and distributed it throughout the  student body. It became an instant hit on  North American campuses and influenced  a generation thanks to its straightforward  facts regarding birth control, sexuality and  abortion.  From there, the Montreal Health Press,  Inc/Les Presses de la Sante de Montreal,  Inc was born—a feminist collective who  dedicated themselves to mass distribution  of facts on healthy sexuality. Over time,  three more compositions were printed: VD  Handbook, Sexual Assault, and A Book About  Menopause. All four set new standards for  debate and community services, and they  rank among the most successful titles in  Canadian publishing history.  Thirty years later, more than 15 million  copies of the the Press' publications have  been produced. Still, as a non-profit organization, the Montreal Health Press has struggled to survive amid cutbacks to public  spending.  The constantly updated handbooks  have been provided to health and education organizations at the lowest possible  price. (Single copies are $5 each, and bulk  copies can be as low as $1 per copy.) In fact,  the people who depended on the Birth Control Handbook 30 years ago are now referring to the same source for facts on menopause!  In 1997, all four publications were updated, including revisions and face-lifts  with new layouts and photos, making them  more attractive and easier to read.  The Health Press encourages clinics,  schools, and community groups to distribute these valuable handbooks. They are  available in both English and French.  Happy birthday!

Health care  advocacy training  A new project to train women in providing advocacy and support around a  variety of health care issues has been initiated by the Vancouver Women's Health  Collective (VWHC).  The VWHC is a volunteer based, charitable, non-profit organization started in  1972. It supports and promotes the idea of  women helping women to help themselves,  and to help women develop a pro-active  approach to their own healthcare. The  VWHC carries out a range of services and  activities for women in Greater Vancouver  and British Columbia.  The organization's new Community  Health Advocate Project (CHA) is co-sponsored by the Vancouver/Richmond Health  Board.  The role of women trained as CHAs is  threefold: (1) To educate women about their  rights in the health care system and ways  to overcome the barriers preventing them  from receiving safe health care. (2) To meet  regularly with the CHA Coordinator and  other CHAs to discuss the barriers to safe  health care they have discovered in their  community, and their plans to confront  these barriers. To collect women's stories  about the violence they have experienced  in the health care system. (3) To be the advocates for their community, doing the type  of work suitable for women in that community in order for them to have access to  safe and appropriate health care.  Anyone who is interested in being a  volunteer CHA will receive extensive training on advocacy, BC's health care system,  some women's health issues, and women's  rights in the health care system. (There may  be additional training as well.)  After completing the training, the  CHAs will become contacts to their communities for health information and assistance. They will work out of a centre where  they will have regular contact with women  in their community.  The time commitment for women interested in joining the CHA project is until  the end of March 1999, with a review and  potential for continuation.

Women and literacy  conference  An international conference intended  to bring together a diverse constituency of  researchers, practitioners and policy makers to discuss issues related to women and  literacy will be held January 24 to 26 in Atlanta, Georgia. The International Conference on Women and Literacy is designed  to allow participants to pose problems and  develop an understanding of the linkages  between women's lives and their literacies.  The conference is presented by the  Center for the Study of Adult Literacy at  Georgia State University, in collaboration  with Georgia Tech's Lifelong Learning Network, Laubach Literacy Action, the Canadian Congress for Learning Opportunities  for Women (CCLOW), and the Centre for  Literacy of Quebec.  Issues tabled for discussion will include women and literacy as they relate to:  welfare to work, health, ethnicity, and domestic violence. During this conference,  participants will examine the issues as they  relate to research, policy, applied practice,  and learners' perspectives.  The early registration fee for the conference is $100, which includes all conference materials, some meals and a reception.  For more information, or an application,  please contact the conference organizer, Sandy  Vaughn, at (404) 651-1400 or  alcsvv@langate.gsu.edu.

Mapping women's  information  Anew project to create a "map" of information about women by women was  one of the key outcomes of the Know How  Conference on the World of Women's Information held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,  lastAugust.  The meeting, which brought together  300 participants from 83 countries, was  hosted by the International Information  Centre and Archives for the Women's  Movement (TJAV). The "Mapping the World  Project," a combination database and web-  see MAPPING next page  OCTOBER 1998 What's News  compiled by Lissa Geller   Cell phones move  to Phase I  Phase I of a formal project which will  provide certain women in British Columbia at extreme risk of violence from their  former abusive partners with a cell phone  is set to begin. This follows the completion  of a one-year pilot project. The cell phones  are pre-programmed to dial 911 service  only.  The pilot was managed by Battered  Women Support Services and supported by  the Ministry of the Attorney General. The  evaluation portion of the project was conducted through weekly interviews with  women carrying the cell phones.  The phones were made available to a  small number of women already enrolled  in the Domestic Violence Emergency Response Systems (DVERS), a community  partnership between BWSS, ADT Security  and the Vancouver Police Department.  DVERS is designed to complement women's personal safety programs, and Phase I  will now see it expanded and re-labelled  the Priority Response Partnership.  The pilot evaluation shows that the  project was well-received and successful.  It also shows the need for the continued  existence of current infrastructure for  women facing violence, as they seek referrals to services and resources to complement their personal safety.  Phase II of the project will possibly see  the greater expansion of the DVERS program where there is little or no infrastructure to support women in situations of domestic violence.  Women using food  banks are poor  A recent Health Canada report shows  that among women and their children who  use food banks, severe poverty and hunger are the norm and that this situation is  not being alleviated by the community-  based system of food banks set up to help  them.  A study conducted through interviews  with women using food banks in Metro  Toronto found that over 90 percent had in  comes less than 66 percent of Statistics  Canada Low-Income Cut Offs for their family size. These cut-offs themselves are notoriously low so the depth of poverty in  these families is staggering.  As well, over 93 percent of the women  indicated that their families had undergone  some level of food insecurity over the past  12 months, with 26 percent of women reporting that their children had gone hungry during that time.  The report notes that the food deprivation documented occurred in spite of the  charitable food assistance women were receiving, as well as in spite of a host of other  strategies which the women employed to  augment their scarce household resources.  The women were also at particular risk  for serious nutrient inadequacies, including calcium, iron, protein and other vitamins and minerals.  The report concludes by indicating that  the consistent inadequacy of social assistance programs is not offset by the ad hoc  activities of community-based charitable  programs like food banks.  by Debbie Singh  CEDAW in the  Pacific  Representatives of Pacific Island governments and administrations discussed  activities to implement the United Nations  CEDAW Convention at a meeting in Fiji in  July.  CEDAW, or the Convention on the  Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination  Against Women is considered a Bill of  Rights for women. The convention covers  all areas of human rights and calls on governments to introduce measures to eliminate any discrimination which impedes  these rights.  About 161 countries have signed the  CEDAW convention since it came into effect in 1991. In the Pacific, four of the region's independent states—Fiji, Papua  New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu—have  ratified the document. The remaining countries of the region have yet to ratify the  document.  The CEDAW Regional Consultation  was the first such meeting of government  representatives to discuss implementation  of the convention in the Pacific.  The regional meeting was jointly organised by the Pacific Women's Resource  Bureau (PWRB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and  the Pacific (ESCAP).  The South Pacific Community (SPC)/  PWRB has been tasked to monitor implementation of CEDAW through the Pacific  Platform for Action (PPA). The PPA is the  blueprint for the advancement of Pacific  women and articulates 13 areas of critical  concern to Pacific women. Some of these  include violence, economic empowerment,  human rights, health, culture, family and  the environment.  The CEDAW meeting resulted in a regional action plan to strengthen women's  departments in the region and assist them  to implement the convention at a national  level.  Emele Duituturaga, SPC Women's De-  velopmentAdvisor called on Pacific countries to question the purpose of the Pacific  women's movement in the context of its  evolution and future direction. She refered  to CEDAW as the "point of convergence  and divergence" in terms of Pacific island  customs and cultures.  Duituturaga encouraged the governments present at the meeting to review their  effective structures and to focus on advocacy based on actions specific to their own  countries needs.  "Many Pacific Island people consider  that the assertion of women's rights leads  to the breakdown of Pacific culture. The  challenge is to find the balance between  being uniquely Pacific, yet achieving development and an improved quality of life.  "Ratification (of CEDAW) in itself is  not enough. Implementation (of the document) and community education is the  key," Duituturaga said.  At the end of the CEDAW meeting, regional government representatives once  again highlighted the lack of technical, human and financial resources as major challenges to development in the islands. Factors such as the need for skills, organisational and management development training in the islands were brought to the fore.  Other development related issues surfacing at the meeting included public sector and economic reforms and downsizing,  particularly in countries such as Papua  New Guinea and the Cook Islands, and the  fallout of the Asian economic crisis on the  Pacific Island region.  The meeting resulted in an accord between the organizers—the PWRB, UNDP  and ESCAP—to continue working together  to assist island countries in implementing  the convention at a national level.  This will be undertaken through collaboration with decision-makers, community, traditional leaders and church leaders.

Last July, the British Home Office recognized new rights for foreign domestics.  These rights were formulated through consultations with Kalayaan, a London based  advocacy group started by Filipinos to  lobby for the right of Filipino and other  domestic workers.  The new employment policy puts an  end to the oppressive Concession Act of  1980, which bound domestic workers to the  employer they were hired by when they  came to Britain. Since the implementation  of the Concession Act, Kalayaan has documented over 2,000 cases of domestic workers who have fled from their employers'  homes alleging confinement, beatings,  sexual assault, rape and withheld wages.  The new employment rights legislation  regularizes the stay in the UK of domestics  who previously found themselves in legal  limbo due to the insufficiencies of the Act.  Following passage of the new policy,  Immigration Minister Michael O'Brien  stated that, "these changes will reduce the  number of domestic workers admitted to  the UK." The Home Office added that domestic workers will now be required to go  beyond the basic performance of household  from MAPPING previous page  site (not downloadable, however), is intended to increase the visibility and accessibility of women's information services  and thereby broaden their base of users.

The defiant  women's fund  In the past, creative women requiring  start up or distribution funds have had to  alter their product to fit someone else's idea  of what it should look or sound like. Traditional financial institutions and families are  often unsupportive of women doing things  their own way.  That's why Verna Turner and Mary  Billy set up the Defiant Women's Support  Fund (DWSF). For years, the two women  talked about the often stated need of  women for easy access to money DWSF  was created to assist women without adequate funds pursue a project or purchase  something they need in order to move on  in their lives.  Both Turner and Billy have put some  of their own monies into the fund. They are  soliciting further investments and donations are being solicited, which will be then  invested in women in amounts currently  not exceeding $1000. Repayment plans will  be tailored to each individual situation.  As investments and donations accumulate, Ethical Funds products will be purchased to diversify the DWSF and ensure a  solid financial base. Eventually, the two  women say they hope to set aside some of  the donations for a Defiant Women's Land  Fund, to purchase property and provide a  place where defiant women can retire and  live out their lives in as free and independent a manner as they choose.  To contribute to the Fund, send donations  to Verna Turner, Box 132, Sointula, BC,V0N  3E0.

Fort Nelson GETT camp speeding to success!  by Emilie K. Adin   More than 170 girls between the ages  of 10 and 13 participated in this summer's  Girls Exploring Trades and Technology  (GETT) Camps across British Columbia.  GETT Camps provide a supportive environment where young women get hands-  on experience and skills in drafting, carpentry and other trades. Instructors for the  camps are women who work in the  trades—one key component of these one-  week daycamps is to introduce participants  to successful women role models.  GETT Camps were first developed  nine years ago at Fanshaw College in London, Ontario. A year later, a camp was  started up in Regina at the Saskatchewan  Institute of Applied Science and Technology. At present, GETT Camps happen nation-wide, with at least six communities in  BC holding camps. [This year, GETT Camps  were also held in four places in Saskatchewan-  Regina, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw and Prince  Nelson and  Princeton.  As well as  receiving  baseline  funds from  the Industrial Trades  and Apprenticeship  Commission (ITAC),  each community's  GETT  Camp Program generated donations and in-kind con-  women who work in a variety of fields  inwhich women have historically been  marginalized and under-represented.

"There's such a huge leap between  what [these girls] have done at home and  what they're allowed to do at our camps. It  opens up a new world for them," says Mackenzie.  A significant aim of the GETT Camps  is to increase girls' awareness of a broad  range of occupations they might otherwise  overlook and thereby offset the discouragement that they receive in their adolescence  in relation to math, science and the industrial arts. GETT Camps reinforce the importance of taking advanced science and math  in high school by stressing the impact these  subjects have on career options.  "Girls are typically not encouraged to  take shop courses and there is a noticeable  lack of female students in higher math and  science courses in high school," says Donna  Dorosh, coordinator of the Fort Nelson  Women's Resource Centre, which admin-  Kootenays GETT campers learning to build their carts  Albert - Winnipeg, Manitoba; Summerside,  PEI; among other places.]  Communities in BC which managed to  garner the financial support and resources  needed to run this project in 1998 were the  Lower Mainland, Nelson and the surrounding Kootenays area, Penticton, Fort  community barbecue.  Another element of the GETT Camps  is role modelling. Field trips to local job  sites provide the girls with the opportunity  to observe women on the job and to become  familiar with various aspects of their work.  Girls also have the chance to take part in  Fort Nelson GETT camp: can  Camp participants in Penticton. They meet many female role models, such as pilots, firefighters and architects.  "If they see a woman in that field," says  Fraser, "this is enough to imprint in their  minds that they can do [this job] too."  Sally Mackenzie, a journeyed cabinet  maker, has for the past three years been the  instructor of the GETT Camps coordinated  by Kootenay Women in Trades and Technology (KootWITT). She points to the im-  we get started?  istered one of the province's GETT Camps.  Dorosh's background as a teacher has led  her to observe this dynamic in high schools  first-hand.  A long-term goal of the GETT Camps  is to increase women's access to apprenticeships, trade school and other post secondary training programs. Current statistics  see GETT next page  OCTOBER 1998 Feature  Women and coops in Canada:  Creating social and  economic stability  Economic survival has always been a critical issues in the lives of women around the  globe. As control over our economic situation  moves further out of our hands, there is growing interest among women to create alternatives to the global capitalist market system—  alternatives that are based more on securing  economic and social stability for women, their  families and their communities, than on maximizing profits.  While women have been involved in cooperative ventures since time immemorial,  more and more women are exploring the possibilities associated with joining or starting up  coops. To further the discussion on the issues  surrounding coops for women, a conference is  being organized in Vancouver for October 16  and 17 [see Bulletin Board, page 21.] An international conference on women and coops  will be held in Paris that same weekend.  Below and on the next two pages, Kinesis presents profiles of two cooperative ventures—Bambino's Family Cooperative and the  Regina Women's Construction Coop and of  WICEN, an online networking strategy for  women involved and interested in coops.  Bambino's Family  Cooperative  by Pamela LaFayette-Robinson  Bambino's Family Cooperative in Victoria, British Columbia is a project that was  started over two years ago. Lori Snow and  myself were the original members, and we  were later joined by Navit Giauque and  Gratia Watson. We are single mothers,  through varied circumstances, and we are  the force behind Bambino's success today.  Initially, we were going to a private enterprise, but then we realized we didn't  have the experience or the financial resources to do so. We also discovered that  we were each skilled at different aspects of  running a business, so then we looked into  working as a cooperative.  We were able to get some training support from Women for Economic Survival  in Victoria and a grant from the Canadian  Women's Foundation. We also received organizational support from Community Options for Parenting Effectively which administered our grant and provided us with  office space and other resources.  For a year-and-a-half we met once a  week for two hours at a time. It was challenging because as the funding we received  was limited, we could not meet more frequently and we often had to bring our kids  along.  On July 16,1998, our vision became a  reality—we opened up Bambino's, a thrift  store and cafe. Our goal is to provide good  quality children's clothing, toys, books and  accessories, as well as baked goods, coffee,  and healthy snacks—all at affordable  prices. Customers will find that our prices  are among the lowest in Victoria.  Our initial idea materialized, thanks to  the hard work of Bambino's cooperative  members, and the generous support of our  local community and various sponsors. We  are a support system for each other, and  while our roles in the Coop are different—  educational discussions and workshops.  We want to be a resource for women, as well  as mentors for other young parents and  low-income families.  When we founded Bambino, we  wanted it to be a place that was family-  friendly and would allow low-income  families to achieve financial independence  Front row (left to right): Saila Giauque, Princess LaFayette-Robinson,  Angelica LaFayette-Robinson. Back row: Navit Giauque, Romona Frey,  Pamela Lafayette-Robinson, Lori Snow, GratiaWatson.  and stability. Our ultimate goal is not just  to assist in eliminating barriers so that low-  income parents can gain meaningful paid  Gratia is the Cafe and Consignment Coordinator; Navit is the Retail and Design Coordinator; Lori is the Office Manager; and  I am the Business and Personnel Manager—many of our job descriptions overlap.  While we still face many challenges as  we learn and grow, our open style of communication has warded off many potential  problems. We are all willing to assist and  learn from one another.  Together, we have persevered through  all the challenges, such as inadequate  childcare and funding, and various personal and business crises, to achieve our  goal.  When we founded Bambino's, we envisioned it as a community meeting place  where children are welcome. Our child-  friendly atmosphere allows children to play  while their parent(s) shop.  Bambino's members and volunteers  working in the store are welcome to bring  their child(ren) into the thrift store during  their shifts. We believe the family is of primary importance, and that a balance can  be achieved between the paid workforce  and the family.  Another one of our goals is to alleviate some of the barriers low-income parents face in acquiring training. We work together with the community and other agencies to provide much needed skills development and work experience to low-income parents.  In the future, we hope to set up a resource centre, with a bulletin board and library, and to facilitate programs such as  work; we are also aiming to eliminate barriers for low-income parents who are already employed. We want to ensure families can become financially stable and able  to live above the poverty line.  As we continue learning valuable  skills—networking, for example—we realize that we still have many challenges  ahead. In fact, we have just scratched the  surface. At times this project consumes so  much of our energy, as we struggle to dismantle obstacles and barriers.  But, above all the challenges and hard  work, we have learned a tremendous  amount. We realize not only our enormous  potential and many talents, but also that  we are not alone. Even those who were initially intimidated by our success helped us  once they understood our goals. We have  and continue to receive enormous support  from the Victoria community.  We are also committed to giving back  to the community: a portion of Bambino's  profits will be used to assist Greater Victoria children from low-income families in  participating in extracurricular activities  (music, sports, arts,ef cetera.)  Come visit us!  Bambino's is located at 607 Vancouver St.  (at Fairfield Rd) in Victoria. Store hours are  Tuesday to Saturday, 10:00am-4:00pm. For  more information, call (250) 995-8499. Donations and volunteers are always welcome.  from GETT previous page  compiled by the Canadian government  show that while women represent a large  proportion of the labour force in Canada,  they continue to face barriers to equal opportunity.  GETT Camps contribute to feminist efforts to ensure that future generations of  women will have the chance to gain meaningful, well-paid jobs—in this case, in an  employment arena where women currently  make up a very small percentage of the  work force.  Mackenzie states that the timing of the  camps is crucial. Some research indicates  that role models have their greatest impact  on students in the middle grades, before  stereotypes are too deeply entrenched and  high school courses selected.  "This is an important time for girls because they begin to make decisions about  courses that affect future career choices,"  says Mackenzie. "We can expose them to  trades and technology before the walls begin to close in."  Liz Wilson is another of the coordinators for Okanagan Peopleworks. She finds  that the greatest thing about the camps is  the tremendous effect the program has on  the girls who participate.  "Girls have enough time and attention  [in our camps] to explore their own ideas,"  says Wilson. "We don't try to put our ideas  onto their projects. This is not the usual way  girls are treated. Usually they have much  more structure."  Linked to the issue of the girls' self-confidence is the way that parents can learn  from their daughters' experiences. "Parents  walk in and are quite blown away with  what their kids have done," says Wilson.  "I think they sometimes underestimate  what girls can do."  These camps serve to prove to girls that  trades /technical work is fun. In the anonymous final evaluations received from the  Fort Nelson GETT campers, positive feedback was given by the participants, such  as'T like working with power tools" and "I  can do anything. I have Girl Power." To  sum up their feelings of the camp, let me  share one of the girls' responses to the final  question in the evaluation. In response to:  "Would you recommend this camp to your  friends?" we received the reply, "Yes way!"

OCTOBER 1998  9 Feature  Report on Filipino women in British Columbia:  Common realities  by Luningning Alcuitas and Lynn  Farrales   The Philippine Women Centre is a grassroots organization based in Vancouver involved  in educating, organizing and mobilizing Filipino women regarding their issues. Started in  1989, the PWC has focused much of its work  on concerns specifically related to migrant  women workers living in Canada.  Below, Luningning is a report on the realities of Filipino women living in two smaller  communities in British Columbia. The massive  forced migration of Filipino women to industrialized countries as domestic workers is an  acknowledged reality. There have also been sensationalized news reports about the tragedies  of many Filipino women who migrate as "mailorder brides," especially to the United States  and Australia. Canada is also a destination for  a growing number of these women. But it has  been very difficult to hear their voices and stories, since they often live in isolated areas.  The Philippine Women Centre has long  been aware of the presence of these women  in such places as Prince George and the  Comox Valley. This past year, we had the  opportunity to visit and share with women  i. i Prince George through a collaborative  iesearch project with the Global Alliance  Against Traffic in Women-Canada. Also, a  member of the PWC spent a month in the  Queen Charlotte Islands as part of her  medical training and was surprised to discover the presence of 40 Filipinos.  We discovered the commonalities in  the situation and experiences of these  women—beginning with their migration  from the Philippines to their present lives  in places extremely different from their  homeland. While we found that isolation  was a prominent factor in their continuing  position of being and exploited and vulnerability to violence, we also saw the strong  desire to educate and organize themselves  as Filipino women. In fact, we came away  inspired, once again, at our strength as  overseas Filipino women.  Filipino women in the Queen Charlotte Islands  The Queen Charlotte Islands [Haida  Gwaii] are located off the Northern coast  of British Columbia near the town of Prince  Rupert. This rugged group of islands is  populated by over 6,000 people working  mainly in the logging and fishing industries. There is also a nearby Haida aboriginal reserve in Skidegate.  There are many similarities between  the small Filipino population in the Queen  Charlottes and the Filipino community in  Vancouver. For example, the waves of migration—from professionals such as nurses,  to domestic workers and "mail-order  brides"—are the same. Segregation of the  community into two classes that work and  socialize quite separately is also common.  The most striking pattern is the prominent number of Filipino women who migrated in the last 15 years. The majority of  Filipino men are relatives sponsored by  these women. This trend is in keeping with  the bias towards the forced migration of  Filipino women.  Many of the Filipino women in the  Queen Charlottes could be classified as  "mail-order brides" because their husbands  travelled to the Philippines to find a much  younger bride after hearing the stereotype  of how Filipino women make "good  wives." The actual transactions occur  through personal contacts in Canada and  the Philippines—an informal industry  helping to fuel the economies of both countries. Once in Canada, the women serve as  sexual partners, mothers, homemakers and,  in some cases, financial supporters of the  household. A smaller number of the Filipino women are former domestic workers  now working in service-sector jobs.  Filipino women in Prince George  Prince George is a growing city of over  100,000 people. Located about 10 hours by  car from Vancouver, its economy is based  on the forestry industry. However, it is also a regional centre for government.  The Filipino community in Prince George  numbers around 200.  Like in the Queen Charlotte Islands, the majority are women. Most of  them came as domestic  workers—primarily because of the presence of  a sub-agent of a well-  known nanny agency in  Vancouver.   The  women  shared that they did not realize  how isolated Prince George is.  They came merely because a  job was arranged through  the agency  The Filipino domestic workers in Prince  George experience the same problems as  those in Vancouver. Long hours, low salaries and the lack of overtime pay were common. However, what was unique was the  added impact of isolation to their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. With little public transportation and virtually no  services designed specifically for them, they  have difficulty even connecting with other  Filipino women.  Often, they meet other Filipinas in the  malls by chance. Through these informal  networks, they receive information about  their rights as domestic workers in Canada.  Without these contacts, the only office "accessible" to them is, ironically, the Canada  Immigration Office. Needless to say, the  women are reluctant to turn to Immigration for help given its power to deport  them.  There are also many Filipino women  in Prince George who came to Canada as  "mail-order brides," or who, once in  Canada, married Canadian men. As in the  Queen Charlottes, the women, while still  in the Philippines, are introduced through  informal networks to their future husbands—later becoming pen pals with the  men visiting the woman and her family in  the Philippines.  The stereotype of Filipino women as  docile, submissive and exotic is also common. It seems that the demand for Filipino  women in the informal marriage market of  Prince George grew by word of mouth.  The situation of these women is even  more precarious than that of domestic  workers. Besides providing cleaning, cooking and childcare, these women become  sexual partners for men much older than  themselves. Many of the "mail-order  brides" are their husband's second or third  wife, forced to care for the children from  her husband's previous marriages. Yet  sadly, many of these women have children  in the Philippines who they hope to sponsor to Canada.  The added impact of vulnerability to  violence and abuse for "mail-order brides"  is striking. The women shared many stories of outright physical and emotional  abuse, without a serious response from  the police who frequently had racist  or sexist misperceptions about  them. There are also more subtle  forms of control being exercised  by their husbands, such  o\ as denying access to  ~' transportation and the  *1 lack of financial support  _§ for household and per-  Js sonal needs.  .§ In these cases, Fili-  ^ pino women have no  ^ place to turn to for help  §3 and support. The existing social service agen-  g cies in Prince George  o have gaps in their under-  "§, standing and, thus, fail to  ~ serve these women in  need. Many women expressed the desire to run to larger cities,  such as Vancouver, where they knew they  could find more support and services.  Continuing the struggle for justice  Despite their grave situation, the Filipino women in Prince George organized  themselves into the Prince George Filipino  Community Association. A mixed group of  women that includes domestic workers,  service sector workers, "mail-order brides"  and first-wave immigrants, have a strong  desire to educate and organize themselves  as Filipino women. The Association is very  supportive of the model of the grassroots  organizing work being carried out by the  Philippine Women Centre.  The Association was instrumental in  supporting Acier Gomez's fight against her  impending deportation by Canada Immigration, courageously speaking out despite  the backlash from the broader Prince  George community [see sidebar.]  Through the link built between the  Association and the PWC, we hope to support and strengthen the further educating  and organizing work which needs to be  done among Filipino women in Prince  George. We can then further expand our  understanding and outreach to Filipino  women in other isolated areas of British  Columbia—and let their cries for justice  resound throughout Canada and worldwide.  Alcuitas is the chair of the PWC and  Farrales is an active member.This article was  reprinted from the newsletter of the Philippine  Women Centre, Summer 1998 issue.  Update on Acier  Gomez's case  The fate of Acier Gomez is  now in the hands of the Federal  Court of Canada. Last May,  Gomez's appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board was  unsuccessful, which means her  deportation order from Canada  remains in effect.  Gomez came to Prince  George in 1990 as a domestic  worker under the Live-In  Caregivers Program. Two years  later, she married her employer.  He had one child already and  they had one child together.  In June 1996, Gomez took  his children and left her husband because of her violence  towards her. A few weeks later,  immigration officials were  knocking at her door, questioning her about her previous  marital status.  A year later, Gomez was  served with a deportation  order on the grounds that she  "misrepresented" herself when  she entered Canada.  The Committee for Justice for  Acier Gomez has been mobilizing  to have the deportation order  withdrawn.

Mercury Retrograde and other stories  by Camille Hernandez-Ramdwar,  Sharon Lewis, Ruba Naddaand Jay Pitter  Sister Vision Press, Toronto, ON  A collection of short fiction from four,  multi-talented women, Mercury Retrograde  takes the reader inside the minds of a diverse and complex set of characters. The  stories include a Palestinian girl caught in  a conflict between the old and new, while  dealing with issues of sexual identity; a  young girl growing up in a mixed-race family, searching for herself through her fearless alter-ego; the warmth of friendship between two young black women; and a  mixed-race South Asian woman in conflict  with social values and stereotypes. The collection reveals much about the diversity of  cultures, the complexity of national pride  and alienation, the resistance to assimilation and the loss of friendship and love  caused by disaffection.  **  Incantations and Utterances: Women, Poetry and Dub  edited by Afua  Cooper  Sister Vision Press,  Toronto, ON  Celebrating the richness and diversity of dub  women poets, editor  Afua Cooper offers a collection of the best dub work being produced  in English. This anthology highlights the  works of twelve women, both internationally established poets and those just emerging, proving that the legacy of dub is as thrilling and powerful as ever before. With contributions by Queen Majeeda, Faybienne  Miranda, Cherry Natural and others. Rooted  in oral tradition, the women come together  to offer their poetry and to put their issues  and concerns on the dub agenda, to chant  about love, survival, equality and sexuality.  Like the drum, their words pulsate with the  driving rhythm of passion. These  word-mistresses use  language and performance to search for and to  celebrate the power of  the word—reminding us  that dub poetry is local,  national and international,  and ultimately, nectar for  the soul.  Sage  by Cyndy Baskin  Sister Vision Press, Toronto, ON  Sage tells the compelling story of the  relationship between three women, Karen,  Nancy and Michelle, who are drawn together through their similar experiences  growing up in alcoholic families. Determined  to build different lives for themselves, they  leave their homes and families. Alcohol,  drugs and sex impact on  their lives  differently,  as they  each  search for  some  meaning to  life. Through  relationships,  therapy, and  learning from  Native culture, the women come to un- derstand the  wisdom of spiritual awareness and knowing oneself. Sage takes the reader through  the very different spiritual journeys of the  women, the harsh and sometimes sordid  circumstances of their lives, illuminating  their struggles, triumphs and failures, and  celebrating their courage.  Curaggia: Writing by  Women of Italian Descent  edited by Domenica Dileo,  Gabriella Micallef and Patrizia  Tavourmina.  Women's Press, Toronto,  ON  Following a tradition of perseverance forged by mothers,  grandmothers, aunts and sisters,  Curaggia provides a forum for  critical discourse about location and identity within Italian cultures. The anthology examines the roles of religion, language,  class, race, gender, ability and sexuality;  documents how Italian women are transforming their communities, excavating social, economic, and psychological experiences of living in Italy and abroad; and celebrates the rich diversity of Italian women's  lives. The stories in Curaggia launch the  processes of naming pain, of shedding  myth, stereotype and distortion of self and  other.  The Queen's New Shoes  by Adwoa A. Badoe, illustrated by Belinda Ageda  Women's Press, Toronto,  ON  The author and illustrator  of Crabs for Dinner [Sister Vision Press] has created another enchanting picture book  for children. The Queen's New  Shoes introduces us to  Esmerelda, the formidable  queen of Istanbul, and her  closet full of 2,499 pairs of shoes.  Esmerelda is not satisfied—she must have  one more pair of shoes to make it an even  2,500. So she issues a royal decree granting a wish to the person who finds her a  pair to match her rainbow royal gown. The  Queen's New Shoesteaches us thoughtful  lessons on greed and arrogance, and offers us a wonderful tale of learning and sharing.

Boys Like Her  is a road movie of young queer life and gender transformation—four distinct voices in  a tag-team dialogue of fictional stories interwoven with exciting and beautiful photographs. With identities ranging from boy-girl  to power-femme to borderline testosterone-  enhanced, these talented upstarts explore  and explode gender, sex and family.  Rita Wong  monkeypuzzle  by Rita Wong  Press Gang Publishers, Vancouver, BC  "The ankle of the moment supports a  whole body of work, snaps if attacked from  a vulnerable angle, let your ankles be naked in the face of fear, to follow the wind's  clues yet to bear steady in changing currents, the curve of slim muscle remains a  wondrous act." Rita Wong's first collection  of poetry is a remarkable achievement.  From the intimacy of the family-owned grocery store to the bicycle laden streets of  modern day China, from the histories of  early Chinese immigrants in North America  to a rainy Tiananmen vigil in contemporary  Vancouver, Wong delivers a stunning volume of soulful reflections on the politics of  race and time. Evocative and urgent,  monkeypuzzle is a powerful work, one that  searches deeply to lay bare and cross the  boundaries of class and race.

OCTOBER 1998 Double Negative: A Vicky Bauer  Mystery  by Leona Gom  Second Story Press, Toronto, ON  Much more than a mystery, Double  Negative uses the genre to pose questions  about guilt, family abuse and violence, and  the complexities of life's important relationships. Vicky's husband falls into a semicoma and  her estranged father has suddenly become  dependent on her. In the midst of all this,  the people who have caused Vicky difficulties are now the subject of acts of violence.  Moreover, Vicky has a new neighbour to  whom she is extremely attracted. His young  son, however, seems troubled and destructive, in stark contrast to his affectionate twin  sister.  From Memory to Transformation:  Jewish Women's Voices  edited by Sarah Silberstein Swartz and  Margie Wolfe  Second Story Press, Toronto, ON  By the editors of the prizewinning  Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish  Women Writers, this compelling collection  addresses political, cultural, spiritual, sexual  and familial issues influencing the lives of  Jewish women today.

This collection aims to explore and define the ties  that bind our past, present and future.  Cracking The  Gender Code: Who  Rules the Wired  World  by Melanie  Stewart Millar  Second Story  Press, Toronto, ON  In the world of  electronic information, are women  seen as simply users of the Net and  skilled workers?  Provocative and  incisive, Cracking  the Gender Code  questions how  the gains  women have  made through  feminism over  the last decades are being  eroded. It  looks specifically at how  the articles  and images of  Wired, the magazine  of the digital generation, are detrimental  to women. Melanie Stewart Millar argues  that simply being computer literate or knowing how to use the Net is not good enough.  Women need to demystify the technology  and crack the gender code to participate  equally in the cyber world of the future.  The Girl Who Hated Books  by Manjusha Pawagi, illustrated by  Leanne Franson  Second Story Press, Toronto, ON  "There were books in dressers and  drawers and desks, in closets and cupboards and chests. There were books on  the sofa and books on the stairs, books  crammed in the fireplace and stacked on  the chairs."

Cunt: A Declaration of  Independence  by Inga Muscio  Seal Press, Seattle, WA  The word "cunt" actually has its roots  in ancient words that were titles of respect  for women. In Cunt, Inga Muscio reclaims  the word as a positive force in the movement to unite and empower women. Her  book is a provocative analysis of women's  relationships with their bodies, including  sexuality, rape, and prostitution.  Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write  About Body Image and Identity  edited by Ophira Edut  Seal Press, Seattle, WA  In more than 20 candid and humorous  essays, a diverse group of women explore  how they have chosen to ignore, subvert,  or redefine the standard of beauty. When  the ideal body reflected in the cultural mirror is white and thin, depending on her race,  ethnicity, sexuality, size or ability, a woman  can find endless ways in which her body  doesn't measure up. The young women  contributing to this collection break down  modem culture's feminine ideal and reinvent  it for themselves.  Beyond the Limbo Silence  by Elizabeth Nunez  Seal Press, Seattle, WA  A coming-of-age story, Beyond the  Limbo Silence traces a woman's journey  from her Caribbean home to a college in  the American Midwest, and her struggle to  integrate past and present against the backdrop of the civil rights movement. Twenty-  year-old Sara Edgehill has left her native  Trinidad in 1963 to attend college in  Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where she joins two  other girls—Courtney from St. Lucia and  Angela from British Guyana—in the task of  integrating the all-white school. For Sara,  coming from a world in which she is connected to a vibrant community and culture,  this cold, alien place in which she is neither  loved nor understood is profoundly shocking and disorienting. Slowly, Sara finds support in her friendship with Courtney, who  covertly practices voodoo rituals, and in a  blossoming relationship with Sam, an African-American who  draws her into the  turbulent civil rights  movement.  The Dyke and  the Dybbuk  by Ellen Galford  Seal    Press,  Djuna       Books,  Seattle, WA  The Dyke and  the Dybbuk features  Dybbuk Kokos, a  soul-stealing demon  of Jewish folklore,  who is freed after  200 years trapped  inside a tree and is  now employed by the  multinational corporation Mephistco.

Reece Johnson  Cleis Press, San Francisco, CA  The Woman Who Knew Too Much is a  stunning debut mystery featuring two compelling female "sleuths"—Jet Butler, a reclusive writer who narrates this tale of murder, water rights, and deadly designer drugs,  and Caroline Marcus, a shadowy figure who  gradually reveals herself as a kind of international "hit artist" working for a private "contracting" firm called The Company. Set in  rural New Mexico near Santa Fe, the novel  opens with Jet trying to help a friend who's  the prime suspect in a local murder investigation. The Woman Who Knew Too Much  has a strong feminist bent, a lesbian  while setting the literary  standard for the current crop  of women's erotic antholo-  subtext, and tackles issues of environmen-  talism and corporate corruption, as well as  personal integrity and history.

In  pursuit of a murderer—could it be  one of them?—the women  share their stories of struggle, triumph, accomplishment and pain. By relating their  personal histories, these women break  open the circle of silence that keeps women  mute, separate from one another, and  "closed in silence."  A Woman Determined  by Jean Swallow  Spinsters, Ink, Duluth, MN  A Woman Determined, by the late Jean  Swallow, is the complex story of how an  automobile accident profoundly transforms  the lives of two women: Margaret Donovan,  the accident victim, and Laura Gilbert, her  attorney. But it is more than that; it is the  history of a close-knit lesbian community  and the consequences of crises upon that  community, its members, and institutions.  It explores women's relationships, particularly how we tend to hold each other to impossibly high standards and the subsequent  anger resulting from unmet expectations.

Helen discovers that the  multinational conglomerate Merrick worked  for is rife with political patronage, corporate  treachery, sexual harassment, disgruntled  employees, vindicitive co-workers and mysterious "vacations." Although fallout from the  investigation quickly puts our heroine at  odds with everyone from her new lover to  her former police partner, she uncovers  nothing to indicate that Merrick's death was  anything but self-inflicted.  The Naked Eye  by Catherine Ennis  Naiad Press  Ever since the woman of her dreams  turned into a nightmare, prominent wildlife  photographer Katherine Duncan vows to  trust only the things she can see through  the lens of her camera. Preferring the dangers of the Louisiana Swamplands to the  perils of love gone  wrong, she relies on the beauty of nature  to fill her days as love once did. But what  about the nights? Katherine's attractive new  landlord, Marlena Weathers, has had her  share of lonely nights, too. Despite  Katherine's misgivings, the women's friendship deepens, as does the sensual tension  between them. But does Marlena have the  patience and the passion to prove to  Katherine that there is more to life than  meets the naked eye?  Endless Love  by Lisa Shapiro  Naiad Press  Writer Andrea Stern is trying to rebuild  her life after a devasting tragedy that left  her grief-stricken and emotionally deadened. She returns home in an effort to reconnect with her family, but dealing with her  disapproving mother, unexpressive father,  and mentally ill sister only deepen her emotional void. Andrea teeters dangerously on  the edge of dispair, until she meets Gwen  Severence, a woman whose strength and  caring will challenge her to make peace with  the past, a woman who will teach her to  live with hope instead of fear, and to believe, once again, that love can be forever.  SALT SPRING ISLAND  OCTOBER 1998 Feature  Women and carpentry training:  Trades are the ticket  by Valerie Overend  Since January 1996, SaskWITT (Saskatchewan Women in Trades and Technology) has been training women in carpentry skills through a program based in Regina. The women who enter the Women's  Work Training Program (WWTP) gain the  basis for completing a four year carpentry  apprenticeship. The goal of the program is  to get these women their trade tickets and  into decent paying jobs.  The WWTP was initiated as a five year  project. Every year, we take 16 new women  into the program. The reality, though, is that  a lot more women want to join than space  and funding allows, so many women are  turned away. Participation is key, and over  time we do lose some women, so the intake is ongoing.  The only criteria for getting into the  program is that women have their Grade  10 Math and a positive attitude towards  physical work. If a woman doesn't have the  math requirement, we will try to help her  get it so she can join the program. Women  with children are also required to have  childcare arrangements in place to ensure  they can complete the program.  When SaskWITT envisioned the program, we assumed there would be 30 per-  training money for the program comes  from the provincial government.  In total, the program involves 46 weeks  of training. This is good, considering that  most government-sponsored training programs last between six weeks and six  months. There are two phases to the  program,and each phase is designed to provide a supportive learning environment in  a traditionally unsupportive trades environment.  The first phase is a 20-week extended  Level 1 apprenticeship. The women learn  the basics of carpentry in the classroom and  the shop, and participate in a life skills component every day. Generally, the life skills  program starts off with self-awareness concepts, moves on to issues of self-responsibility (such as problem solving and assert-  iveness), and then finally ends with strategies for self-guidance (goal setting, future  planning, budgeting, et cetera). We add a  component on job skills to provide the  women with a better understanding of the  culture of a construction workplace.  At the end of the 20 weeks, the women  write the provincial Level 1 carpentry  exam.

This turned out to  be true when we started, but three or four  months later, 95 percent of the women  walking through the door were Aboriginal  women. This is in large part due to our location within the inner city and the program's ability to provide a flexible and supportive workplace.  The majority of the women are on social assistance when they enter the program. Partly, this is because the career  placement centres most active in sending  women to the WWTP are ones working  with women on social assistance.  However, it is not a requirement that  women be on social assistance. Women  who have other income support can still  receive assistance with expenses to enable  them to participate in the program. All the  The second phase of the program is 26-  weeks of on-the-job training. Most women  gain trade time [which is needed for certification] working on projects renovating a  variety of buildings for non-governmental  organizations in the city. One of the projects  the women typically work on is a Habitat  for Humanity house, a house built largely  by volunteers for people on fixed incomes.  Earlier this year, a crew of seven  women from the training program finished  a large project doing renovations at the local Food Bank. The women were supervised by a woman who had attended Level  1 training when SaskWITT first developed  a carpentry training course in 1991. This  woman went on to apprentice with the  Women's Renovation Company for a year,  then moved into the commercial workforce  while completing her four years trade time.  She recently completed her Level 4 training at SIAST Palliser Campus in Moose Jaw  Some members of the Regina women's construction coopertive at the shop  and wrote her journey level carpentry  exam.  The WWTP only delivers the classroom portion for a Level 1 certificate. For  higher levels, the women go to SIAST (Saskatchewan Institute for Applied Science  and Technology). Because of the enhanced  delivery-the classroom portion for Level  1 usually takes seven weeks to complete-  and the additional business training in  the WWTP, what is normally a four-year  apprenticeship, in fact, takes closer to five  years for participants to complete.  After 46 weeks, women can join the  Regina Women's Construction Coop  (RWCC), which was started with support  of SaskWITT [see below.] Through the  RWCC, the women learn business and  marketing skills, as well as gain more  trade time in order to allow them to write  the certification exams for the higher levels. Ultimately, the women will write the  interprovincial journeypersons exams.  One challenge we face is that there  are not enough women with journey papers who can train and supervise the  women in the program. Currently only  two of us working with the WWTP have  our journey papers: Denise Needham  (who is also the business manager of the  RWCC) and myself. Another woman, we  with the skills and certification to facilitate  the program and the job training.  A construction coop for women  In January 1997, the Regina Women's  Construction Cooperative began operation,  although it took several months to actually  get up to speed. The first few months were  certainly more difficult than anticipated  due to difficulty acquiring funding for administration and staff positions.  In June 1997, SaskWITT received a  grant from the Women and Economic Development Consortium, which is supported by contributions from about six  large companies and administered by the  Canadian Women's Foundation. The grant  was for five years, although the bulk of the  money was allocated in Years 1 and 2. This  money was allocated to pay for a Business  Manager for the Coop full-time for three  years, as well as professional fees for legal  or accounting for the full five years.  SaskWITT also received funding for  the Coop from the provincial government's  Strategic Initiatives Program to hire a  superintendant until this December. Strategic Initiatives also provided funding for  WWTP- Level I apprentices  hope, will have her papers soon. Needless  to say, we are always looking for women  see CONSTRUCTION next page  OCTOBER 1998 Feature  from CONSTRUCTION previous page  SaskWITT also received funding for  the Coop from the provincial government's  Strategic Initiatives Program to hire a  superintendant until this December. Strategic Initiatives also provided funding for  business training, marketing, internet  linkup, some rent and a small amount of  bookkeeping. The cooperative shares a  shop and office space with the WWTP.  Since August 1997, the Coop has been  a separate legal entity from SaskWITT.  While SaskWITT still administers the  Coop's financial and business interactions  for the most part, the Coop is slowly coming into its own. It is actually in an excellent position financially and working under very pleasant circumstances for a new  business.  When it began, the RWCC was supported 100 percent through grants. Now  though, only half of the coop's budget  comes from grants; the other half is raised  through the construction contracts it does.  The federal government does contribute  some monies in the form of wage subsidies  that amount to $5,000 a year per woman in  her first year.  There are currently 11 women who are  members of the Coop. Seven of these  women have been with the program since  its inception. This past Spring, six women  in the Coop attended Level 2 training at  SIAST Palliser Campus. That meant half of  the class were women, which was previously unheard of.  In terms of running a successful business, the Coop has found a niche, specializing in barrier-free construction and renovations. Twenty percent of our business in  1997/98 are projects for seniors and peo  ple with disabilities. We're shooting for 40  percent this year.

WWTP- Level I apprentices  to build residences that are accessible. Right  now, RWCC is renovating an old church  into a residence for seniors—this includes  constructing ramps, wider hallways, lower  windows, rounded corners, and so on.  The women in the coop have had some  specialty training in doing home audits for  people with disabilities. As a result, part of  the business training done through the  Coop focuses on learning about and responding to the needs of people with physical disabilities.  Currently, we are doing renovations,  but we want to start building homes. Our  The most pressing issue for the RWCC  is ensuring living wages for the members,  most of whom also support a number of  dependents. In July 1997, the members who  had been working in the Coop since its beginning received a raise from $5.60 to $7.00  an hour. While the wages paid through  RWCC are still low compared to what most  men in the construction industry are getting, they're not considered pathetic, just  poor. The starting wage in the industry is  around $7.00.  In a year from now though, the women  in the coop will be earning more than most  women earn. As their qualifications and  experience increase, they will be able to  earn even more.  The stigma of poverty is minor when  compared to the reality, and the women in  the Coop are determined to work until they  have reached an acceptable wage. The  RWCC is also looking at buying into the  provincial pension plan for its members.  Within five years, the goal is to have  women trained as journey persons and in  running a business, so that the RWCC  would take over from SaskWITT the job of  training women in carpentry.  What drives me to encourage other  women in getting their carpentry certification is my own experience. Eighteen years  ago, I was left alone with two babies and  no trade ticket. The options looked pretty  glum—any of the "typical" jobs women  could get would not go anywhere. That's  why I made the decision to get journey papers. To me, learning a trade means you can  raise your family in dignity.

Women in Cooperatives  Electronic Network  by Carol Hunter  WICEN (Women in Co-operatives  Electronic Network) is an electronic discussion group ("listserve") open to women and  men who share an interest in issues surrounding women in co-operatives and  credit unions. It provides a forum for an  exchange of ideas, experiences and information; a place to pose questions or propose solutions; a place to share "best practices" and case studies; and a place to network or make new contacts.  WICEN was launched by the Canadian  Co-operative Association (CCA) in response to a growing interest among women  in the cooperative sector for a venue to  share ideas, experiences and concerns, including concerns about women's (under)  representation on boards of directors and  ways in which women can be more involved in decision-making within co-operatives and credit unions.  At the CCA's 1995 annual general  meeting, a resolution was put forward calling for the establishment of a national  women and co-operatives network. This  resolution was moved by Marian Jefferies,  a director of Co-op Atlantic, a wholesale  coop. (Jefferies, herself, is the only woman  on Coop Atlantic's board.) The resolution  passed unanimously.  Currently, WICEN has 100 subscribers—subscribers who are members, directors, employees, volunteers, and managers  of co-ops and credit unions. Some subscribers are involved in smaller, local coops and  credit unions, while others are involved in  larger federations and associations. Although, currently, most of the subscribers  are based in Canada and the United States,  WICEN is open to people worldwide.  WICEN is an important forum because  there are few opportunities in Canada for  women to come together to discuss women  and coops. Canada is such a large country,  and many women don't have the budget  to go to coop conferences.  One of the key issues addressed  through the listserve is board representation. Many women on coop boards feel  quite isolated and have a great desire to net  work with other women in similar situations. WICEN is a good place to discuss  strategies to involve more women on  boards.  Subscribers also discuss issues related  to running a coop business, such as how to  access start-up capital or grants, or how to  set up a coop in a specific sector. One other  item that has been the topic of much discussion are social audits. Many subscribers are addressing ways to measure an organization's performance on more than just  financial grounds.  WICEN is currently moderated by the  CCA. As a moderator, CCA will try to keep  the discussions rolling, suggest discussion  topics, and post items of interest.  You can participate in this conference  in a number of ways by:  • posting questions;  • responding to questions posted by  others;  • letting us know about resources (print or  electronic), conferences or workshops;  • letting us know about co-op or credit union initiatives which promote women's involvement in decision-making;  • letting us know about co-op or credit union practices which present barriers to  women's involvement; or  • posting short documents, book reviews,  or other materials to the conference. (Please  do not post documents longer than three  pages. Longer documents can be posted in  CCA's website.)

Centime Zeleke  When one scans the program selection  for any major international film festival and  notices the paltry number of women directors represented, it becomes evident that  women are still having a hard time breaking into  the  film industry at  both the commercial and independent  level.  That the Vancouver International Film  Festival (VIFF) be any different in this regard from other film festivals would not  have been unexpected. However, as I  scanned through the program guide, I was  pleasantly surprised by the number of entries by women.  This year the focus of the VIFF is on  themes of music and exile and immigration. Within these themes, there are a  number of works by women, ranging from  the compelling films that make you ask  yourself, "How did they get so much  money for this production?"  One film in this series done from a  feminist perspective is In my Father's House  by Fatima Jebli Ouazzani. The documentary follows the filmmaker back to Morocco, the country she left in order to escape an early and arranged marriage and  the other traditional expectations of  women.  The film, though, is not a simple day-  to-day look at Jebli's return. Instead, it  blends three narrative strands. The major  thread of the film is, of course, her return  home after 16 years away. Jebli has made a  life for herself in Amsterdam, but she feels  there may have been a price paid for leaving—the price being an exile  from one's  own home  and from  parts of one's  self.  The second thread is  the story of  Jebli's grandmother who  speaks about arranged marriage and surviving life under the  conditions the filmmaker more or less fled.  Through interviews, it becomes apparent  that the grandmother recognizes she has  had little choice in determining what her  life would look like. And she regrets this.  The third thread of Jebli's documentary is the story of Naima. Naima is a Netherlands-born Moroccan woman who opts  to have a traditional marriage in Morocco  with the man she has chosen to be her hus  band. Naima's story contrasts heavily with  both Jebli's and her grandmother's story,  particularly since we see how Naima is allowed entrance into her father's house,  while Jebli is rejected. The film's unique storytelling method allows the audience to ponder women's choices,  women's autonomy and Naima's  naivete, in a non-didactic fashion.  Also under the theme of music and exile, the VTFF will present  through its archival program a  tribute to Josephine Baker. Baker  was an African-American singer  and actress who became one of  Europe's best paid entertainers  while residing in Paris in the  1920s and 1930s. Her film roles  were "exotic," constructed for a  white male gaze.  In those roles, Baker is usually  shown as happy, dancing and singing. A  popular and well-circulated image of her [see  the VIFF catalog] is one  in which she is dancing  with bananas around her  waist.  Cheryl Dunye's recent film The Watermelon  Woman illustrates the importance of honouring actresses such as Josephine  Baker, as they paved the  way for the Black filmmakers and actresses of today.  More importantly, Dunye's  film   reconstructs   the  agency of the women cast  in roles such as the Watermelon Woman, by showing  the context in which they  worked.  The VIFF's presentation  of Josephine Baker provides little context,  except to say she was a "woman of colour"  with "sexy modernity." The program is  careless and seems to be more a part of Vancouver's tired lounge revival.  It is in the Cana- dian Images Program where I  found a large  number of interesting works by  women. This  year's program is  the largest VIFF  has ever presented with over  90 entries. Of  these 90, approximately 40  films are made  by women. As  Ken Anderlini, curator of the Canadian Images program, admits, "This is not quite  gender equity." Still, it is noteworthy.  Among the works by women, several titles  are films made by Aboriginal women and  women of colour. One film to definitely  check out is Alanis Obomsawin's third film  in her series about the Oka crisis,  Spudwrench: Kahnawake Man. [Her previous  films were Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance and My Name is Kahentiiosta.]  ^^^^_        choir Gin* f    *  Other  films to catch  are Annie Frazier Henry's  visual and musical odyssey through the  landscape of North America, Singing Our  Songs; Shelley Niro's Honey Moccassins; and  Shanti Thakur's Circles. Circles is an intimate and passionate documentary that  looks at the way "circle sentencing"—a traditional form of justice for some Aboriginal communities—is being combined with  the Canadian justice system. Also veteran  filmmaker Loretta Todd's new documentary, Today is a Good Day: Remembering Chief  Dan George, delivers both content and style.  Local artist Jennifer Abbott will premiere her long-awaited piece about animal  factory farming in her documentary, A Cow  at my Table. Unfortunately, Abbott's film is  an intellectually weak look at a subject that  is rich with content.  The documentary swings  back and forth  between the  not-so-convincing and far-too-  simplistic argument that all  animals have  the right to not  suffer, and the  not-very-  well-explored  idea that factory farming  is part of  what  Va n d a n a  Shiva calls  "an ethics of  anesthesia;"  that is, part  of a system that commodities all life forms  into objects for capitalist consumption.  Nevertheless, the documentary does  present some interesting and not so known  facts about the animal industry, and is  worth seeing if only for that.  While there are a number of films directed by women at the VIFF, much of the  content they deal with is not about  women at all. Our  lives are still not  in focus. It was  therefore refreshing to  check out the  entries from  Quebec. Choir  Girls, Ladies of  the 9th Floor  and It's your  turn, Laura  Cadieux [directed      by  Denise Filiatrault] are all pieces that are  unapologetically about women's lives and  women's stories.  Patricia Kerns and Deborah Van Sleet's  Choir Girls is a good-looking, charming and  funny documentary about a Montreal  women's choir called Maha. Ultimately,  however, the piece is about women com  ing together tc  change each oth  er's lives and thi  lives of womer  around them.  Choir Girls is being screened witi  Catherine Martin's Ladies of the 9th Floor, ir  a program dedicated to the memory o  Kathleen Shannon founder of the now defunct National Film Board's Studio D, the  world's first government funded film unil  dedicated to supporting and promoting  women filmmakers.  Creating feature length films costs a lot  of money. Women, and particularly lesbians, often do not have access to the resources needed to create features. However  there are a lot of lesbians making shorts.  "Quickies," a program of queer Canadian  comedy presents a number of works by local lesbians, including Maureen Bradley's  Go Dyke! Go and Carol Ducharme's Straight  from the Suburbs. The program also contains  the lovely lesbian noir-ish type film, If Happened in the Stacks, a story of lesbians chasing each other in the library stacks.  Talking about features, women should  definitely check out the feature length documentary, The Brandon Teena Story. Directed  by Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir, the  documentary has been the recipient of numerous awards at Gay and Lesbian Film  Festivals around the world. The documentary tells the story of transgendered  Brandon Teena who spent most of her daily  life passing for a boy, and charming and  seducing girls. However, when she is outed  as a biological woman, Teena is raped and  eventually murdered.  Using a straight forward journalistic  style, Muska and Olafsdottir's documentary explores the complexities of being  transgendered. It also explores the ways  women's biological bodies are so easily  treated with violence by the men who assume they control and can therefore determine the fate of women's bodies.  Rumour has it that about six feature-  fiction and non-fiction films about Brandon  Teena are in the production stages. It seems  Teena will continue to be somewhat of a  sensationalized object well after death.  Knowing this increases my appreciation for  the simple and factual way in which  this, the very  first documen-  tary about  Brandon Teena,  has been presented.  The Vancouver International  Film Festival runs  September 25 to  October 11.  E. Centime Zeleke  has been involved in  numerous community media projects. She is  the 1998 program coordinator of Out on  Screen, the Vancouver Queer Film and Video  Festival.  OCTOBER 1998 Arts   Oral histories of people with developmental disabilities:  From the inside out  by leanne Johnson  In October 1996, British Columbia finally closed the last of its large institutions  for people with developmental disabilities.  The automatic institutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities  began over a hundred years ago with the  creation of the Woodlands in New Westminster, and ended on October 21, 1996,  when the last two residents were moved to  new homes within the community.  The process of downsizing Woodlands,  Tranquille, Glendale and the Endicott Centre took 15 years. The residents were returned to their original communities, which  were spread out all over the province.  Afraid that the stories of the former  residents would be lost and their voices forgotten, a committee from the BC Self Advocacy Foundation initiated a project to  collect oral histories from the former residents. [The BC Self Advocacy Foundation is  an organization comprised of directors and  members with developmental disabilities, setup  to encourage individuals with developmental  disabilities to become part of their community  and to encourage self-advocacy.]  When the committee finished collecting the oral histories in 1996, they decided  that a book would not be an appropriate  medium to give voice to these individuals,  so the organizers approached Persimmon  Blackbridge and asked her to collaborate  with the story tellers.  Blackbridge, a Vancouver-based writer,  sculptor, and activist, was an excellent  choice  t o  work  on this  project.  She  had  previously  collaborated  in sev-  e r a 1  projects  including the  sculp-  t i  Marianne Crowley working on her contribution to the exhibit  book project, Sunnybrook, which examined  the dehumanizing effect of institutions and  the inner strength of those who live in them.  Blackbridge and the former residents  collaborated to create From the Inside/OUT!,  a multi-media art exhibition that tells the  stories of 28 individuals. Their stories remember the pain and sorrow of isolation  and the courage of resistance, and the relationships they formed.  The  core of  •2 the mul-  -§ timedia  | exhibi-  P^ tion is  g the oral  | histo-  5 ries.The  £ exhibi-  ^ tion is  _^ c o m -  ^> prised  £> of indi-  |j vidual  8 and col-  § lective  "tart  pieces of  visual  art based on the residents' experiences of  living in and out of these institutions. Some  were there for a period of two years, others  as long as 35 years.  The visual art is combined with photographic and historical documentation  hung along walls that are formed into long  maze-like corridors. A soundscape plays  over the exhibit as you walk along and another soundscape can be listened to with  headphones.  The organizers hope the exhibition will  be an opportunity to educate the community in the social justice issues that affect  people with disabilities. From the Inside/  OUT! is presented by the BC Self Advocacy  Foundation in partnership with the BC Association for Community Living, the Artists and Communities Program, and the  Roundhouse Community Centre in celebration of October as Community Living  Month.  While Community Living Month has  not yet been proclaimed by the province,  celebrations are being planned throughout  the province. Call your local association for  Community Living to find out what is happening in your area.  From the Inside/OUT! is at the Roundhouse Community Centre, 181 Roundhouse  Mews, Vancouver until October 11, with an  opening Gala on October 1 at 7:00pm.  leanne Johnson is a Vancouver-based writer and  visual artist.

OCTOBER 1998 Arts  Indigenous women in the arts:  A creative gathering  by Michelle Sylliboy  The art and creativity of indigenous  women will be honoured at a gathering at the  Roundhouse Community Center in Vancouver,  November 6 to 8. Ancient Memories Thru  Women's Art, organized by the Indigenous  Women in the Arts Collective, will bring together indigenous women from a broad range  of artistic expressions for a weekend of workshops, discussions, performances and healing  circles. As well, an exhibition of works by Aboriginal women artists will be on display at the  Roundhouse. Opening night of the exhibition  will be October 17 at 7:00pm and will run until  November 10.  Michelle Sylliboy, the key organizer of  Ancient Memories, talked to Kinesis about  how the gathering came together, what it hopes  to accomplish, and the challenges it faces.  Sylliboy is from the Mi'kmaq Nation. Originally from Una'ma'kik (Cape Breton), she has  been living in Vancouver since 1990. She is a  painter, sculptor and poet, and a recent graduate from the Emily Carr Institute of Art and  Design.  Initially, the idea for the gathering was  inspired by an interview I did with Sandra  Laronde [for Kinesis, March 1997 issue.]  She's with Native Women in the Arts  (NWIA) in Toronto, and they've been organizing a lot of activities in support of the  creative work of Aboriginal women artists,  such a readings, workshops and performances. [NWIA also publishes a journal of writings and artwork by Aboriginal women. The  first journal published in 1995 is titled, In Vast  Dreaming; the second, published in 1996, is  titled, Sweetgrass Grows all Around Her.]  When I attended Emily Carr, I felt out  of place when it came to relating to western art and artists. While a number of artists did come to the school to give artists'  talks, most of the ones invited were geared  toward western art. This trend is slowly  changing, but it's still way behind when it  comes to First Nations artists and artists of  colour. That's when I knew this gathering  was really important.  There are lots of Native artists, but  when you look for books and resources  about these artists, they're hard to find. It's  difficult to find resources about Aboriginal  artists because it always comes down to a  lack of funds. Money's not a bad thing because everybody needs to survive, but you  don't always have the funds needed to  bring these people or resources to you.  The purpose of the Ancient Memories  Thru Women's Art gathering is to start a networking and mentoring process and to address the lack of information about Aboriginal artists and questions such as: Where  do emerging artists go when they're just  starting out? Who do they talk to? Who can  they learn from? What other things can they  bring towards their creativity? What is First  Nations art?  The gathering is intended to explore  our creative tools. We're all artists, whether  we're painters, dancers, musicians, poets,  writers. As First Nations people, creativity  surrounds us as a whole. It reaffirms how  distinct we are as First Nations people.  Therefore, it's really hard to define indigenous  or Aboriginal art  because it's not  the same as  western art.  At the gathering, there will  be Elders, youth  and women of  all ages—because that's how  you learn. You  learn from your  kids, from your  grandparents,  from your community. Everything is community based. Without the community, you lose  yourself. That  was evident at  our fundraiser.  [The Indigenous  Women in the Arts Collective held a benefit  concert and silent art auction in mid-September.] The community rallied together and  put the event on.  Ancient Memories is being set up from  a mentorship point of view, so that emerging artists can connect with artists who  have been at it for a long time. The gathering will also bring women from different  mediums together to allow their expressions, opinions and creativity to come out  through sharing.  Loretta Todd is going to premiere her  new documentary on Pauline Johnson.  Denise Lonewalker is premiering her new  dance. Sarah Good is going to do a workshop based on her songs and stories. We're  also going to have workshops for women  on how to put their portfolios together and  on what is available in terms of grants. The  Wild Women Revue—a group of Aboriginal women in Victoria who organize shows  for Aboriginal women—are going to do  workshops on the politics of getting funding support.  The only challenge for us right now is  getting funding on a bigger scale. Funding  for single artists is a lot easier to find than  for an event. It would be great if someone  out there would just donate a large amount.  It's hard to raise funds because this is an  event for Aboriginal women. We've written a lot of proposals and grants and people are hesitant to support us.  I think there's a fear [among funders]  because we're  not    charging  people $300-400  to participate.  How can we?  No one from the  community  would   come.  Funding agencies are also saying they won't  fund us because  they think it's a  "conference."  Well, it's not a  conference; it's a  _^ gathering,  _§ which   means  |^ it's about artists  ^ sharing stories  32 from a First Na-  perspec-  ig tions  £, five.  How did I end up here  f. aging sometimes, but we  have to plug on.  The gathering will work because I think it  is very important for the community. If just  one person says, "I've always wanted to do  this and I'm so grateful that I was able to..."  then it'll be worth every effort putting it  together.  We're holding the gathering at the  Roundhouse Community Center and their  mandate requires the project to be community-based and accessible. This is fine with  us and it's one of the reasons we applied  for their support. Accessibility is fundamentally what Ancient Memories is all  about.  Women generally don't have a lot of  money. The gathering is for those who  wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity  to take a video workshop or a photography workshop or dance workshop or a  drumming workshop. Women can attend  the gathering on a pay as you can basis.  Those who cannot afford an entry fee can  attend for free.  The gathering will allow many women  to do something they would never have  been able to do because they've got kids or  because they work or don't work. We will  provide workshops for kids as well a lot of  women face because they do not have the  money to put their children in these programs.  Women are going to come away from  the gathering having developed a piece of  work. They'll come out with new knowledge, and many of them will leave with a  taste of what it's like to work in different  art forms. That's one of the main things we  want to happen.  I've talked to some women who don't  consider themselves artists, and those are  the women we want to have at the gathering. They are the artists who are behind the  scenes at the potlatches and pow wows-  the weavers, headers, carvers, dancers.  These are the women who have been at  their art for 10 to 50 years, or so. They are  the ones who have contributed to their communities. We want them to share their experiences.  What it comes down to is the definition of what indigenous art is and what we  have done with it for the past 500 years.  I'm very excited to say we've had a  great response from the community. Chief  Bill Williams [of the Squamish Nation] attended our fundraiser and gave a very supportive speech. Chief Robert Joseph donated art and catalogues from his show at  the Vancouver Art Gallery. A lot of Elders  came out, and we received support from  the performers, all of whom donated their  talents. We've also received generous donations from artists, so there's tremendous  activity.  Kelly White, who co-organized the  performers for the fundraiser, said she received a lot of phone messages from people saying they were still riding high from  the benefit concert. People are hearing  about the gathering and they're excited.  I think it's going to be a great weekend  of creativity, healing and learning. A positive vision for the future.  The Indigenous Women in the Arts Collective will need a lot of volunteers to help document the event, as well as equipment: video  cameras, tape recorders, et cetera.

OCTOBER 1998 Arts  Interview with sculptor Myriam Fougere:  Mermaids gotta have vulvas  by LeslieTimmins   When you hold one of Myriam  Fougere's sculptures in your hands, you  feel as if you've lifted something right out of the landscape, a stone or shell or  bone. The clay surfaces  glow from hours of hand-  burnishing washed over  with the warm earthtones of  leaves and algae used in the  pit-firing. Mermaids,  women lovers in naked tender embrace, sculptural  vessels flowing out from a  fold of vulval lips, all reunite the female body with its  natural sources.  Fougere began showing  her work at women's festivals  in the late 1970s. Recently,  she's exhibited at the Grunt  Gallery, the Gallery of British  Columbia Ceramics and Art  Inside.  Leslie Timmons: The vulva is one of the  primary forms you work with. How did  that come about?  Quebecoise sculptor  Myriam Fougere presents  hand-built sculptures in  porcelain.  Myriam Fougere: I just picked up some  clay in a friend's studio one day and started  playing with it. When I realized I had made a vulva  shape, a cunt, I immediately collapsed the clay. But  for about six months I  asked myself where had I  seen this shape before in  art. Where was it in the  world? I realized it was  hidden.  Timmons: When you  start a new piece, do you  know whether you'll use  the vulva shape or the  shell, or some combination?  Fougere: Once I cut the  clay the size is set, but the  shape is still to come. As I  turn the clay in my hands  the shape emerges, as if between the clay and the  hands there is an understanding of what  needs to be done.  Timmons: You're self-taught. Did you  ever consider going to art school?  ;: I thought about it, but I never  went. I decided that women would  be my audience and I would listen to their feedback.   Recently, men have begun to  buy my work, too, which  is fine.  Timmons: What led  you to the figurative  pieces like the women  lovers?  Fougere: As a lesbian  I am looking, once again,  for images that are not in  the world. As a woman I  also feel that we need to re-  appropriate our vision of our  bodies, and our real bodies are  much more interesting to sculpt!  am trying to discover in myself a vision of a woman from the inside. |_0  How can I represent a woman's  body with all of its seriousness and life experience? I am looking for this essence and  for a true connection between our bodies  and nature.  Timmons: Your mermaids make this  connection very explicit.  Fougere: I love the idea of gangs of mermaids roaming the sea together,  but I find the representations by  male artists terrible: long hair,  pretty features and perfect  breasts, but no genitals. I  took the hair off to give  them a kind of dignity and to show  their faces better. I  see them as elegant,  big women with  strong shoulders  and large breasts,  and I always give  them a vulva.  I     encourage  people to hold my  sculptures.   They  have   a   calming  irs power, like stones. I  want to keep my work accessible in price, too, so that people can afford  to buy it.  An exhibition and sale of Myriam  Fougere's work will be held December 4-6  in Vancouver.
