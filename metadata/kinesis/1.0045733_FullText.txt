Telephone: (212) 570-5001  A guide  to quitting  the killer weed  The Canadian Council on Smoking and  Health has recently produced a resource  called Taking Control: An Action Handbook on Women and Tobacco. The handbook is intended as a guide to help groups  and agencies understand women's tobacco  use and design quitting programs that are  relevant to girls and women.  The book traces a short history of  women's smoking, presents information on  the tobacco industry and its profit-making  strategies, explores what smoking may  mean to women and how women can work  together to kick the habit.  Attractively designed, the handbook is  intended to compete head-on with cigarette  ads directed at women. It also contains resource hsts of contact names and publications.

KINESIS ////////////////////^^^  /////////////////////////////////////^^^^  NEW  WS  Fumbling all 'round  Playing football with our funds  by Nancy Pollak  It's 1890—oops, 1990—and the ladies are holding a bake sale.  On International Women's Day, Vancouver women occupied the  Secretary of State offices to protest funding cuts to their centres.  Denise McCann of White Rock pedalled cookies and muffins to  cover the costs of rent, telephones and staff for 33 centres. She  collected $32.  Women's centres and feminist  organizations across Canada are  scrambhng to have their funding  restored in the wake of last February's proposed cuts to the federal  Secretary of State Women's Program (SecState).  Instead of sweating out the fiscal year-end—often a period of  financial hardship—women have  been staving off the bitter end.  And not aU groups have made it.  In British Columbia, where almost 30 centres lost 100 percent  of their core funding, the closures have begun. Centres in Kiti-  mat, Terrace, North Vancouver,  Kelowna, William's Lake, CampbeU River, Courtney, Port Alberni  and Chetwynd wUl dose at the beginning of AprU.  Some centres are shutting down  completely. Others wUl maintain  skeletal operations and devote  their entire (volunteer) energies  to fundraising. Others refuse to  make that sacrifice and wUl only  continue if and when money for  staffing is found.  Women's groups haven't given  up on finding money for salaries  and overhead from the very source  that axed them. Mary Collins, the  federal Minister Responsible for  the Status of Women, has been  the subject of repeated requests  for funding restoration, as has the  Secretary of State Gerry Weiner.  CoUins, a newcomer to the portfolio, has shown Uttle knowledge  and even less savvy about the hot  potato she's been handed, and is  widely considered by feminists to  be ineffectual.  Weiner has been a study in  indifference. Multiculturalism (his  other portfolio) is his baby, and  the women's and Native programs  of SecState receive httle of his  attention. A spokesperson from  Weiner's office said the minister  "agonized" over his decision to cut  women's groups—an agony he has  kept very private.  In Ottawa, the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC) and the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) have  aimed their lobbying efforts at 30  Conservative MPs who won the  last election by a slim margin.  "[Gran] may force  us to offer...job  hunting groups in  order to get a  dime..."  (The AFN also lost all their SecState funding. Altogether, $50 mU-  hon was cut from Indian and Inuit  programs in the federal budget.)  As Kinesis goes to press,  Weiner is preparing to appear  before an aU-party parliamentary  standing committee to defend his  estimates—and there is a smaU  hope that lobbying efforts may  produce changes to the SecState  budget.  Native transition house coming  by Joni Miller  A woman arrived at the Vancouver Status of Women as Kinesis was in production. She had  been beaten by her boyfriend and  wanted to get out. Calls to local  shelters proved futUe—they were  full or had conditions the woman  could not meet.  "I'd really Uke to talk to other  Native women," she said.  Soon, this woman wUl have that  option. In March, the provincial  government confirmed core and  operational funding for a Native  women's transition house to be located in Vancouver.  The Healing Spirit Lodge Society (HSLS), the group that wUl  administer the shelter, is currently investigating either buying  a buUding or having one buUt to  their specifications.  If aU goes weU, they plan to be  open by September 1990 with an  aU Native staff.  The house wUl offer a holistic approach, says Gloria Nicolson,  president of the Society.  "We place a lot of value on our  spirituality," says Nicolson. "It's  not just getting beaten up—you  have to deal with the whole family  hfe. There is a problem that wUl  not be solved just by transferring  the woman and chUdren from the  violent home."  Nicolson has a long history  of involvement in the Native  women's community. She is executive director of the Professional Native Women's Association which formed initiaUy as a  support group. In the last 10 years,  the association has been involved  in projects ranging from group  homes for teenagers to a survey of  the needs of Native elders.  Doreen Sterling of Hey Way  Noqu says there is a great need for  such a shelter. "We have felt the  existing places to be not sensitive  to [Native women's] needs as Native people," she says.  Hey Way Noqu is a new famUy treatment program whose mandate is to help Native people overcome problems relating to sexual  abuse and drug and alcohol addiction.  Sterling says that Native women  who come to the program to work  on their alcoholism find that, as  they get healthier, they want a  healthier partner as weU.  "They need a place to go [to  get away]," SterUng says. "Most of  these women have famiUes on the  reserve, not in town."  The HSLS started as a committee of the United Native Nations  (UNN) on family violence. After  researching the situation in the  Native community, they concluded  that a shelter was badly needed  and began negotiations with the  province.  HSLS may be looking to the city  to provide a land base.  "We're ready to help in any  way we can," says Joyce Preston  of Vancouver city social planning.  "Ten additional beds in the city  wUl certainly be welcome." She  says the city supports the new  project. This has not always been  the case.  "At one point, the city supported a multicultural transition house, not a Native one,"  says Nicolson. Women from Battered Women's Support Services  (BWSS) and the Women's Research Centre have worked for several years with social planning  to establish a feminist transition  house in Vancouver.  (Vancouver lost its feminist-run  transition house in 1983 under Socred privatization measures: after a lengthy fight, the Salvation Army took over the existing  house.)  Nicolson reports feehng anxious  when the Ministry of Social Services and Housing announced the  funding for a Native house.  "Pressure was put on us to say  that since there were only operational funds for one house, we  should give up [and establish a  multicultural house]," says Nicolson. "It was a hard decision to  make, but we felt that because  the money was designated, we  wouldn't give it up.  "The women didn't set out  to divert our funding ... they  worked in good faith, and we supported that." Nicolson added that  she is happy to hear that the other  group wUl continue their efforts.  Says Karen Larcombe of BWSS,  "A Native women's shelter is obviously necessary, but it isn't  enough. H the government is trying to pacify women by funding a  Native women's house, they're ignoring the reaUty that [Vancouver]  stiU doesn't have a house that services the whole community."  Nicolson stresses that the new  house wUl not just serve battered  women. "We also want to offer  shelter to elders who are mistreated and people in crisis. We'll  be keeping two beds for crisis situations [other than battering].  "We want a place where people  reaUy, really care."  In British Columbia, much of  the fightback effort has focused on  Carol Gran, the provincial Minister Responsible for Women's Programs. Gran was on a provincial  tour of women's groups and local communities when the federal  cuts were announced and she was  quickly showered with requests for  emergency funding.  The federal government has justified its abandonment of core  funding for women's centres by  calling it a provincial responsibility. Gran's portfoUo, less than a  year old, has yet to pour any new  money into women's groups.  The minister's response has  been less than encouraging. In  late February and again in March,  Gran and CoUins met to discuss the fate of the province's  women's centres—and issued confusing statements about their  plans and timetables. (Gran even  denied having received any requests for emergency funding,)  By mid-March, Gran admitted  at a pubUc meeting in Vancouver that she had no intention  of providing operational funds to  keep the centres open, but that  she would announce a new program in early AprU. Numerous BC  women's centres have faxed Gran  copies of their SecState funding  apphcations so that she could be  fully aware of their services and  needs.  Like CoUins, Gran appears  to be a nice enough woman  hamstrung by httle power, less  understanding—and a political  affiliation to a pro-business, anti-  woman party. The best proof of  this is in the proverbial pudding:  in the month of March, as women's  centres pleaded with the ministers  for emergency funding, Gran and  CoUins handed out juicy plums to  their other constituents.  CoUins, who is also the junior  minister of defense, dehvered $28  million to Microtel Pacific Research of Burnaby for a satellite communications system which  operates at Extremely High Frequency.  TRIUMF, the particle physics  complex at the University of  British Columbia, received $89  million from Gran, who doubles as  Minister Responsible for Government Services.  Gran also bought herself major embarrassment when, on International Women's Day, her ministry announced a women's Medal  of Recognition and logo contest.  Women's centres are angry that  Gran has rejected the call for  emergency funding and are apprehensive about her forthcoming  program. The stated priority of  Gran's ministry is, ironicaUy, economic independence for women. In  Social Credit terms, this translates  into individual solutions to individual problems.  In public and media appearances, Gran has presented herself  as a survivor of single parenthood  and a successful business person.  Training and re- entry programs  rate high in her choice of programs, a fact that hasn't escaped  women's centres.  see Funds page 4  KINESIS Across B.C.  FMEP  Confusing program yields little  by Shelly Quick  In January 1989 the B.C. Ministry of the Attorney General  launched the FamUy Maintenance  Enforcement Program (FMEP).  This highly criticized program is  designed to help single parents secure chUd support payments from  their negligent ex-partners, usuaUy men. Clearly there is a need  for such a program. A recent  FMEP status report cites research  which estimates that "up to 85  percent of ah former spouses in  Canada regularly default on their  support payments."  Unfortunately the program has  proved to be unsatisfactory in  many ways—particularly for those  on income assistance who are  forced to use the largely ineffective  system.  Lorna H. is one of the women  on income assistance enrolled in  the FMEP against her wUl. Lorna  has been with the program virtuaUy since its inception and has yet  to see any benefits from her participation. She is angry, she is frustrated and she would gladly obtain  her own legal counsel but the government wUl not aUow her to do so.  In the spring of 1987, Lorna was  pregnant with her second chUd,  hving on welfare and worrying  about the fact that the father was  denying paternity and threatening  to leave the country for at least  six months. Given the chance to  participate in what she beheved to  be a FMEP pUot project, Lorna  seized the opportunity.  "I often feel that I have no control over my Ufe because I'm a single mother and on income assistance" says Lorna. When she en-  roUed in the FMEP pUot project  she saw it as a potentially empowering experience. Now, three years  later, Lorna feels marginalized.  She stiU hasn't received any  payment from the father of her  second chUd and her file has lain  virtuaUy stagnant for over a year.  The only contact the program  has initiated with Lorna concerned  their attempt to force the father  of her first chUd to start making  support payments. The FMEP is  pursuing this despite the fact that  both Lorna and the man have an  unspoken agreement that he does  not have to acknowledge publicly  or privately his paternity.  The government last took action against the father of Lorna's  second chUd in December 1988.  He appeared in court and arrangements were made for him to begin making monthly support payments in January 1989. Lorna felt  strongly that he should be made  to pay support for the time that  had elapsed between her pregnancy and the date when he finally showed up for court, but she  was advised by the government's  lawyer not to "push" the already  reluctant father. Lorna recaUs feeling that her ex-partner was receiving more consideration than she  "Unwanted: sexual harassment"  by Noreen Shanahan  "Wanted: single mom to share  house in New Westminster. $250."  This classified advertisement,  which appeared in March in Vancouver's Province, was undoubtedly circled in red by several  women in their search for an affordable place to Uve.  When Patricia Moore read it  and caUed the hsted number, however, she became furious and concerned that women not share the  house with the man placing the ad.  Four years ago she responded  to an identical shared housing ad,  moved in, and within a month was  told to either become his sexual  partner or pack her bags and get  out.  "At the time I was four months  pregnant and coUecting welfare.  When I first moved in it was okay,  then he started saying he wanted  a girlfriend—and couldn't meet  'nice girls' in bars. I lasted a month  before he finally kicked me out on  a mere 12 hours notice.  "And the other day, when I first  heard his voice on the machine, I  wanted to warn women, I wanted  to find some way to stop him."  Moore immediately called the  Tenants Rights CoaUtion and  WAVAW (Women Against Violence Against Women) expressing  her concern.  "I realized women are raped  aU the time, and generaUy there's  nothing I can do about it. But  in this case—there must be something I can do," she said.  According to Cindy Bratkowski  in the Province's classified advertising department, the ad can't be  puUed unless documentation Uke a  pohce file exists. "It's very hard  to deny advertising, we can't do  it merely on the basis of a complaint."  Moore is considering placing a  'warning' notice close to the man's  advertisement, and writing a letter  to the editor at the Province.  MeanwhUe, on the basis of  Moore's complaint, the Vancouver  Housing Registry (listing avaUable  rental units throughout the Lower  Mainland) refuses to accept this  man's listing.  Brett Haughian of the Tenants  Rights CoaUtion recognizes this  kind of coercion as one particularly ugly side effect of the overaU  lack of housing.  "As a woman's housing options  lessen, sexual harassment by landlords increases," he said. "Patricia  Moore's caU [to TRC] represents  several other women who feel too  vulnerable to complain."  Haughian received another caU  several months ago from a landlord requesting a tenant.  "He asked if I had a hst of single  mothers needing housing. I asked  him why and he said he wanted  to share his suite with a 'young,  white, pretty Woman.' "  Moore is also concerned that  high rents makes the $250 this  man is asking particularly appealing.  "The average price for a two  bedroom suite is $560, not including utUities; welfare only aUows  $450," she said.  When she stiU hadn't received  any payments by March 1989,  Lorna decided to leave the program. She went to legal aid and obtained the services of a lawyer she  felt comfortable with. Aparently  both Lorna and her new lawyer  were unaware that leaving the  FMEP was no longer an option.  (According to the GAIN Amendment Act of September 1988, single parents on welfare must use the  FMEP and its lawyer. A Charter  challenge is now underway against  the act.) (see Kinesis Dec/Jan.  1990)  By chance the FMEP discovered Lorna had obtained her own  lawyer when an FMEP worker recognized Lorna in court in October  1989.  Since that time, Lorna has been  alternately told that she was never  enrolled in the FMEP, that she  was enrolled in the program but  that nothing further can be done  on her case untU her ex-partner  is arrested, and that the program  is looking into seizing a portion  of her ex-partner's income tax return, wages, or any U.LC. benefits  he is receiving in order to secure  the arrears and future monthly  payments.  This last possibihty sounds positive but Lorna describes herself as  "afraid to hope." She also points  out that under current regulations,  welfare aUows single parents to receive only $100/month in support  payments—anything more goes to  the Ministry. She worries she wUl  only receive $100 of the $1400 her  Funds from page 3  "Gran has been talking about  ways of 'improving' women's services, " says Kairn Mladenovic of  the Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre. "We're concerned she may  force us to offer job readiness or  job hunting groups in order to get  a dime [from her ministry]."  The provincial legislature reconvenes the first week of AprU  and details of Gran's program wUl  be released then. Since a BC election is expected as early as May,  Gran's program wUl Ukely be a  hard-sell. The Socreds are slated  to introduce a budget AprU 19  and, given their unpopularity with  female voters, other programs may  be tossed to women's groups.  Centres in BC have had a difficult time waging the fightback  and planning to survive the imme-.  diate future. The BC and Yukon  Association of Women's Centres  (BCYAWC), with help from the  Vancouver YWCA, has been consolidating statistics and other relevant information on the various centres' services— information that was not readily avaUable  when the cuts occurred.  Differences have emerged about  how to deal with the crisis. The  Port Alberni centre, for instance,  has rejected the idea of carrying on  projects and programs with volunteer labour only.  "That has been SecState's agenda for years," said Alberni's  Heather Nelson. "Their explicit  message has been, 'get your volunteer membership up and keep it  up.' We decided there had to be  funded staff."  ex-partner owes and she also worries that, in the future he may only  pay support every few months to  ensure she receives $100 in total. It  is possible to make appeals to the  ministry in such cases but Lorna  adds, "I'm so sick of fighting for  money."  FMEP director Sandra Edel-  man recognizes that negligent parents sometimes maliciously make  late payments and says the program usuaUy wUl take funds directly from the parent's source of  income in such cases. When parents work iUegally or hide assets,  however, the government is powerless. Of the $100/month for parents on welfare pohcy, Edelman is  quick to point out that it is a decision of the MSSH, not the FMEP.  The distinction between the  FMEP and the MSSH is confusing  to many people, including those  enrolled in the program. When  asked for a possible reason that the  lawyer refused to ask for pre-natal  payments at her December 1988  court date, Edelman responded by  pointing out that pre-natal payments are not covered by FMEP  lawyers.  So how did Lorna obtain her  original court order for monthly  chUd support payments with the  aid of a FMEP lawyer? Lorna acknowledges that her experiences  have been confusing but comments  "they can call it what they Uke,  I'm forced to be in their program,  I've been in the program since  1987, and I want my money."  SecState project funding is still  avaUable to women's centres, but  project funds include smaU hon-  ourariums only, never salaries.  Port Alberni wants that pohcy to  change.  Other centres intend to carry on  with major volunteer fundraising  efforts. The upcoming BCYAWC  conference agenda was amended,  after some controversy, to focus  on the funding crisis. Both Carol  Gran and a SecState representative, invited to attend the conference, have been asked to confine  their visits to half an hour.  In national news, 36 women  in Newfoundland occupied the offices of SecState in St. John's on  March 26 to protest simUar funding cuts to that province's seven  centres—five of which face closure.  (Forty centres in Quebec were  also cut.) Demanding Ml restoration of funding, the Newfoundland  women intend to stay untU AprU  1st.  The four national women's  groups completely cut—the pubUcations Healthsharing, Canadian Women's Studies and Re-  sources for Feminist Research  and the Canadian Association  for the Advancement of Women  in Sport—are looking for new  money sources. Healthsharing,  which lacks the institutional affiliation of the other periodicals, is  lobbying the Ontario ministry of  health for support.  "Our May issue is on hold, and  we're hoping to go to press in August," said Healthsharing editor  Amy Gottheb.  4 KINESIS ///////////////////M^^^  Fathers:  Going for custody, going for control  by Georgina Taylor  Ignoring the blatant reality that  families are often places of violence  and patriarchal domination, famUy court judges in Canada are increasingly applying the concept of  "gender neutrality" when making  decisions about chUd custody.  The result: when Canadian men  apply for custody, they now win  50 percent of the time. Another  result: thousands of women and  chUdren are devastated when their  bonds of love and caring are  severely limited.  Last spring, women facing custody battles in Vancouver decided  to form a support group. The impetus for the group, which is sponsored by the local YWCA, grew  out of a forum on chUd custody organized by the Vancouver Status  of Women. The group's founding  members, Ajax and Nancy, work  with battered women in Vancouver. Their observations of women's  custody experience includes a recent increase of men using the  court process as a place of violence  and control.  We, the women in the group, beheve that as long as inequalities  exist between men and women,  gender neutrality is an absurd legal doctrine in custody situations.  We have a forum to question why  the courts grant custody to fathers when they continue to physically abuse, sexuaUy abuse, abandon and neglect their chUdren.  We question why men, who have  not been the primary caregivers  of children, win over women who  have been. We've learned that  money is a major factor. Male economic superiority is seen as contributing to the chUd's best interests. Upon divorce the paternal standard of hving rises by 42  percent, whUe the maternal standard often decreases by 73 percent. Most single parent mothers  and their chUdren Uve far below  the poverty hne.  While women decry their poverty and lack of maintenance support, the state's solution is to  grant custody to fathers which reduces the costs of social assistance  for women and maintenance enforcement. ChUdren become mere  commodities and women an economic drain on the state in the patriarchal economy.  As stated by one group member:  "Society praises us for nurturing  our chUdren at home. Yet upon divorce, if we choose or if economic  reality forces us to remain home,  we are accused of using our chUdren as a meal ticket."  Given this poverty, how can  women find good, ongoing legal advice? Dependence on legal  aid lawyers severely restricts the  choices women can make in selecting lawyers. Lawyers who accept legal aid cases do not always  give them priority, and the ones  who do are overwhelmed by their  caseloads. One woman recaUs that,  after inquiring about the status of  her case, her lawyer's response was  "after aU you're just a legal aid  case."  In addition most lawyers are  men and not empathetic to women's experience. These factors  leave women poorly represented  whUe the economic gap between  men and women assures that men  can continue a long, drawn-out  court battle.  Our experiences in the custody  support group show us that fathers  who fight for custody of their chUdren are not primary caregivers  during marriage. Many of them  physicaUy abuse and psychologically terrorize their wives. Some  have physicaUy ejected mothers  from their homes and kidnapped  the  chUdren.  With  the help of  ...fathers  who fight  for custody...  are not  primary  caregivers  friends and mother replacements,  men brainwash their chUdren by  economic manipulation, physical  force, emotional intimidation and  criticism of the mother.  PhyUis Chesler's study on chUd  custody in the US concluded that  62 percent of fathers who custo-  diaUy challenge women have physicaUy abused their wives during  marriage and/or during the custody battle.  We have learned in our group  that mothers who are professionaUy successful are criticised for neglecting their chUdren. A woman  in our groups describes her judge's  remarks: "You cannot possibly  look after your chUdren and have  a career." This same judge did not  address how the custodial father  would accommodate his chUdren's  needs and his professional career.  H we are artists, we are judged  flaky and unstable. One such noncustodial mother was ordered by  the judge to quit school and get  a fuU time job, so she could pay  maintenance to the custodial father whUe he attended law school.  If we leave or walk out in order to "find ourselves" we are uppity and too smart for our own  good. If we are Native women married to white men, or if we are  immigrant women, we often lose  our custody struggles. A Spanish  speaking woman in the group said,  "I lost custody of my chUdren today, I don't know what happened.  I don't speak Enghsh."  If we have affairs, we wUl be cus-  todiaUy challenged for sexual activity. A member of our group recalls: "My husband had five affairs  during our marriage. When I had  an affair he told me, 'no judge is  going to grant custody to a whore.'  Sexual outlaws (strippers and  prostitutes) lose custody as weU  as access. Lesbians arouse disgust  and terror in the minds of judges.  Lesbianism is the ultimate threat  to patriarchy. They can sometimes  oidy retain custody on the condition that they change, hide or deny  their identity. In other words: Stop  being lesbian.  Our sociahzation in a patriarchal culture as "good girls" works  against us, making us unprepared  to fight men in a court of law  for custody. When we become immersed in the judicial process we  take our emotions with us, and aU  our training about what it means  to be a "good mother" and a  "good person."  We may approach the custody battle with shame, trepidation, humUiation and powerlessness. We quickly learn that men  use violence, threats and lying to  win. We haven't learned to value  aggression—we don't want to—  but we soon learn that lying becomes necessary.  As a result of their sociahzation, men are armed with the  tools to fight custody battles and  win. They are taught to meet aU  challenges with a competitive and  aggressive response. This, combined with an equahty doctrine entrenched in law, sets the stage for  an ever-expanding statistic on sole  custody awarded to fathers.  A custody battle challenges our  psychological identity and our relationship to our chUdren. When  women are battered psychologically, sociaUy, economically and ju-  diciaUy we may become immobi-  Uzed. Depression, Ulness, anxiety  and chronic fatigue may soon follow. Women come to the custody  support group armed with what  are perceived as personal stories.  Through sharing our experiences,  we are reminded that the personal  is pohtical.  We recognize that behind our  immobUization and depression is  anger—and we become enraged.  We recognize our need to speak  out, but we are Umited by our fear.  We realize that custody battles  may never end as our children are  held hostage. Our support group  encourages women's strength and  voice. It helps to aUeviate the humUiation and self-blame women  experience when we are isolated in  a patriarchal culture.  For information about the  custody support group, contact  the YWCA at 683-2531.  LEAF challenges:  A BC brand of sexism  by Kinesis Writer  British Columbia is the only  province in Canada whose Human  Rights Act permits discrimination  on the basis of sex in the area  of employees' benefits—and the  Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) has launched a  human rights complaint to change  the law.  SpecificaUy, LEAF is challenging the fact that employee disabihty benefit plans can exclude  women on pregnancy or maternity  leave. The consequence of this exclusion is loss of income: women  are eligible for Unemployment Insurance benefits at 60 percent of  their pay, but ineligible for disability benefits which usuaUy total 90  percent.  Company disabUity benefits are  triggered when a person cannot  work for medical reasons. "Pregnancy, chUdbirth and recovery are  legitimate medical reasons for absence from work," said LEAF  spokesperson Jane ShackeU. "Excluding women from disabihty  benefits because their inability to  work is related to pregnancy is sex  discrimination."  LEAF has the Supreme Court  of Canada on their side. Last summer, the court ruled in Brooks vs  Canada Safeway that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy  was indeed discrimination on the  basis of sex. In Brooks, three female Safeway employees in Manitoba chaUenged the company's disabihty plan which excluded pregnant women.  Now, a hospital worker in the  Lower Mainland (who prefers to  be unidentified) has teamed up  with LEAF to challenge her em  ployer and the BC Human Rights  Act which permits the discrimination.  Not aU feminists agree that  pregnancy and maternal leave  should be labeUed disabilities for  the sake of employee benefits.  LEAF acknowledges the difficulty.  "It's a semantic problem," said  ShackeU, who noted that Safeway  itself argued that pregnancy was  not a disabihty, but "voluntary"  and hence not subject to benefits.  The Supreme Court's ruhng  in Brooks, whUe very strongly  favouring the rights of pregnant  women, does not guarantee success  for the LEAF case. The Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms  permits laws to be discriminatory  if the discrimination is "demonstrably justified in a free and  democratic society." Employers—  and provincial legislators—can be  expected to launch such a defence.  KINESIS Across Canada  ^XXXX^S^XX^X^^  Beware the  Meme implant  by Susan Dyment  Many Canadian women who have had a  breast implant during the past five years to  "beautify" their bodies are the centre of a  •growing controversy about the health risks  of the Meme implant. In 1989, Health and  Canadian doctors  are now removing  Memes in advanced  states of  disintegration  Welfare Canada ordered one of its senior  researchers to destroy his evidence of the  Meme's danger to women, fired him when  he refused to remain sUent, and declared the  Meme implant safe.  Dr. Pierre Blais stiU claims that the implant is not safe for women because the  foam material used in its construction was  The Graduate, 1989:  never designed for insertion in the human  body. Dr. Carolyn Kerrigan, a Montreal  plastic surgeon who has used the Meme implant on her own patients, wrote the Health  and Welfare document which reported the  Meme implant involved httle risk. Real  Laperriere, the former Progressive Conservative Party riding executive and Montreal  businessman who has sold 12,000 Memes in  Canada during the past five years, refuses  to speak to the press.  The Meme device is a basic sUicon proth-  esis covered with the same foam that is used  in air filters, mattresses and aircraft parts.  The foam manufacturer, Scotfoam of Pennsylvania, upon learning of its use in breast  implants, stated: "We do not recommend  such uses due to a lack of long-term data  on health effects."  The foam is glued to its prothesis with  an industrial-strength bathtub sealant by a  California company, Surgitek. Surgitek defines the foam as medical grade, despite a  statement by the American Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) that there is no such  thing as medical grade foam. The FDA investigated Surgitek in 1988 and reported  dozens of serious violations, including lack  of quality control and a lack of sterUity to  the extent that workers were seen blowing  into the "sterile" breast implants.  A growing number of American and  Canadian women are reporting health complications after receiving a Meme breast implant. Canadian doctors are now removing  Memes in an advanced state of disintegration after as httle as eleven days of implantation. Once in the body, the cells that attack the foam are extremely capable of oxidizing and breaking it down, and the ultimate abihty of women's bodies to expel this  material from the bloodstream is unknown.  Plastic surgeons have reported an inabUity  to retrieve foam imbedded in the breast tissue from defective Memes.  ^2rW  Most women complaining of Meme complications are speaking out after less than  a year's implantation. Nothing is known  about the long-term health effects for those  stiU receiving the Meme breast implant  in Canada; many questions remain unanswered.  Perhaps a better question might be why  the government is protecting consumer access to this product. The Meme implant  is a simple invention whose promotion in  Canada has resulted in high incomes for distributors and plastic surgeons, at the cost of  Ulness and trauma for an increasing number  of implant recipients.  Mistressing the arts of change  by Margaret Stodart  Completion of graduate level studies in  Enghsh results in the granting of a Masters of Arts, right? WeU, aU that might be  about to change, at least if Carolyn Gammon has her way.  Gammon, a graduate student at Concordia University, was scheduled to convocate  in May 1989 with a Masters of Arts in Creative Writing. Her graduation is on hold indefinitely, however, because she is officiaUy  seeking to be granted a Mistress of Arts.  Gammon contends that the degree she is  granted should reflect the reaUty of both  her educational experience and her personal pohtics. Her commitment, over the  last three years, to a lesbian-feminist thesis has led her to actively challenge the hnk  between sexism and semantics.  "My thesis was created from a long and  rich lesbian poetic tradition," said Gammon. "It is the education I claimed at Concordia that has led me to question the very  foundation of language and raise this question of how words shape society."  Like many feminists, Gammon is conscious of how words connoting maleness  have power—and words connoting female-  ness lack respect. "Many terms that are  used for women [such as mistress] have  been derogated to take sexual connotations," says Gammon. "These words should  not be mistreated...It's about time we reclaimed these terms. We have to take these  connotations and wave them in the air."  HistoricaUy, gender-specific alternatives  such as the Spinster of Arts (to complement  the Bachelor of Arts) and gender-neutral alternatives such as the Laureate of Arts were  used in the degree granting process in North  America throughout the nineteenth century.  Burrett CoUege in Tennessee, which  closed its doors in 1925, was a coeducational institution which conferred the  Mistress of Arts degree. SimUar degrees  were most often conferred by colleges for  women. By the 1930s, these degrees were  phased out. Nevertheless, a glance at history makes it clear that Gammon's request  is not without foundation.  The prevaUing bureaucracy at Concordia does not view Gammon's request as  simple, however. In fact, a cynic might  claim that the maze of pohcy-making bodies  through which Gammon's case must wend  exist purely to discourage such challenges to  the status quo.  The renaming of any degree at Concordia  needs the approval of the foUowing bodies:  Please mail my subscription for 1 year (4 issues) to:  Name:     Code:   Q Individual $12 (Personal cheque only)  D Group/library/institution $24  (USA: odd $2 Cdn or US funds; Othe  Donations ove  D New D Cheque enclosed  [J Renewal Q Biff me  : add $3-lnternotional Money Orders Only)  $10 are tox deductible  Return this card and your cheque to:  WOMEN HEALTHSHARING  14 Skey Lane, Toronto, Ont.

Clearly, the length of the process serves admirably as a deterrent.  Further, Graeme Decarie, a member of  the Gender Equity Committee, beUeves  Gammon's case is not a priority.  "There are enormous problems facing  women at Concordia," said Decarie, "such  as lack of women in faculty and pay equity.  Is this important and can we afford to put  our resources behind it?"  Gammon disagrees. "To say that it's not  a priority is in itself sexist. They think that  because it's just dealing with words it's not  a priority."  Gammon has been told her case would  become a priority if she represented a larger  number of students: renaming one person's  degree to both reflect personal preference  and give others the future option necessitates creating a whole new degree.  H the Gender Equity Committee's response was intended to discourage Gammon, that is not hkely to happen. Gammon  sees herself involved in a ground-breaking  exercise which is undeniably part of the slow  eradication of the sexism entrenched in educational practices. Her hope is that other  female students wUl come forward and make  similar requests.  Carolyn Gammon is asking for letters of support, information pertinent  to this issue—and feedback.

KINESIS Across Canada  mi  WHAT* S NEWS?  by Linda Choquette  Pay equity  pays up in  Ontario—for some  Pay equity may become a reality for  22,500 female employees of the Ontario government. Raises ranging from a few cents to  as much as $7/hour make up the total $96  million it wUl take to bring the government  into compliance with its own pay equity legislation.  Redress payments under the settlement  wUl be made in lump sums over the next  three years. The first cheques wUl go out in  AprU, 1990.  "There were very, very few jobs that received no increase," said Isla Peters, pay  equity spokesperson for the Ontario Pubhc  Service Employees Union. Some increases  were as high as 28 percent, and more than  90 percent of the employees performing  female-class jobs got hikes. Most female-  class jobs—so called because of the percentage of women in the classification—are clerical, cleaning and health care work.  Pay equity legislation requires a comparison of female-class jobs with male-class  jobs. Points of comparison include skiU, effort, working conditions and responsibiUty.  In one example from the new agreement,  the work of psychiatric nursing assistants  was compared to that of supply clerks. The  nursing assistants wUl get raises of $2.07 per  hour.  The union president called the increases  a victory for the union, but noted the legislation does not apply to women in many  workplaces where there are no male employees for job comparisons, hke Ubraries and  day care centres.  Sexual offenders  start young, get  little help  According to a recent study, one in four  aUeged sex offenders in Canada is under  the age of 18, and of those teen-aged offenders, more than half are 14 years old.  A spokesperson for Metro Toronto's YMCA  who was involved with the study expressed  surprise at the age of the offenders and  called the problem "a terrible topic to confront and think about."  The study found that victims ranged in  age from two years to 76, but the majority—  71 percent—were aged from six to fifteen.  Eighty-eight percent of the victims were female. The offenders were virtuaUy aU male.  Their offenses were fondling, attempted or  completed forcible penetration. They used  physical force in 43.6 percent of the attacks:  five percent of attacks involved weapons and  verbal abuse was common.  Boys under 12 years of age were responsible for 27 percent of the attacks. "Sex  offenders appear to be getting younger,"  said the report's authors, Dr. Frederick  Matthews and Dr. WiUiam Stermac. Unfortunately, the authors apparently faUed  to make a connection between youthful offenders and society's sanctioning of male  violence against women, resorting instead  to sociological/biological explanations. Peer  pressure and the thriU of novelty were cited  as possible motivation for younger attackers  and the report suggested older adolescents  are "hormonal/chemical-driven." ■  Bemoaning the lack of services set up  to treat young sex offenders, the YMCA  blamed lack of government support and denial of offenders, their parents, professionals  and the pubUc as exacerbating the problem.  The statistics, from a recent Metro  Toronto study, were extrapolated for a national estimate.  Welfare cutbacks  linked to  Free Trade deal  Jane Scharf of the Ottawa-based Coalition for Better Access to Social Services  (CBASS) is concerned that welfare cutbacks are a result of the Canada-US free  trade agreement (FTA). Scharf warns that  welfare disentitlement initiatives in Ontario  and Nova Scotia may represent new national pohcy designed to satisfy FTA conditions.  "The free trade agreement," says Scharf,  "requires that Canadian social programs be  harmonized with those of the US in order  to ehminate unfair trade subsidies. [In the  US] the decision of who is eligible for welfare is made by labour market conditions in  each state."  According to Scharf, weKare departments  have used the "labour market conditions"  disentitlement reason both ways. In Ottawa,  singles and heads of two parent families  were deemed ineUgible in 1988 because unemployment had decreased, but the number  of "employable" welfare appUcants was up.  In Nova Scotia, aU able-bodied persons  were cut from welfare rolls because unemployment figures were high, and the demand  for welfare was expected to increase by 50  percent in 1990.  Ottawa advocacy groups have been active in protesting the disentitlement pohcy.  According to Scharf, "The ministry would  back down if advocacy groups got involved  in individual cases. However we beheve that  it may start again in Ottawa at any time."  In January, CBASS filed for an injunction  with the Supreme Court of Ontario against  the Ottawa welfare department's disentitlement pohcies. CBASS is organizing a committee of concerned community workers and  lawyers to consider developing a national  response to these FTA-hnked welfare pohcies.

No protection  for farmworkers  from toxic spray  Dinoseb, a herbicide banned in the U.S.  and partiahy banned in Canada, has been  approved by Agriculture Canada authorities for continued use on BC's raspberry,  bean and pea crops despite acknowledged  risks to farmworkers. The Canadian Farmworkers' Union, based in British Columbia,  were quick to denounce the decision, charging the government with heeding the wishes  of growers' associations at the expense of  the workers.  The Agriculture Canada memo which announced the pohcy says "apphcators [farmworkers] were considered to be exposed to  significant health risks in handling Dinoseb  products."  Referring to a compromise between  risks and benefits, government spokesperson  MicheUe Edwards said, "Some growers had  a strong need for the product and they said  there was no alternatives avaUable."  Edwards said Dinoseb would be completely banned when alternatives were  found, but according to a report on the  chemical, a comparable replacement is years  away. MeanwhUe, BC farmworkers, the majority of whom are immigrant women, have  no choice but to endure such health hazards.  Dinoseb is labeUed as toxic in Enghsh  and French, but a farmworkers' union  spokesperson says Punjabi, Vietnamese and  Chinese language warnings would be more  appropriate.  Taxpayers must  support defense  spending, says Court  The Supreme Court of Canada wiU not  hear JerrUyn Prior's claim that using a portion of her taxes for defense spending is a  violation of her constitutional rights. "I've  put my beliefs before the system of law and  basicaUy been told it's not worth hearing,"  she said.  Prior, a Vancouver endocrinologist has  withheld about $1000 each year from Revenue Canada since 1982. The amount, proportionately equivalent to the amount earmarked for defense in the federal budget,  goes to a trust fund administered by Conscience Canada.  Two years ago the Tax Court of Canada  ruled that Prior, a Quaker, could not choose  to divert some of her income tax towards  peaceful expenditures. She appealed this de  cision to the Federal Court of Canada and  was turned down in February 1988. The  court ruled freedom of rehgion and conscience could not take precedence over the  government's constitutional right to raise  money for defense.  The same court in October 1989 dismissed Prior's claim that the government  infringed on her freedom of conscience.  Now, with the Supreme Court's refusal to  hear her case, she can go no further in the  Canadian judicial system.  "It shocks my behef in the system of law  ... and what the Charter of Rights reaUy  means," she said.  Prior may take her case to the United  Nations Human Right's Commission.  See ya in the  movies—especially  if you're a guy  Statistics contained in a report commissioned by Toronto Women in Film and  Video show that women in Canada's film  and television industries are paid less than  men and under-represented as producers,  directors, location managers and art directors.  According to the study, women working for independent companies dominate  bookkeeping, wardrobe, makeup, hairdress-  ing and script supervision jobs and earn on  average about 75 percent as much as men.  Women comprise more than half the National Film Board workforce, but hold 92  percent of office positions, and only 36 percent of filmmaking jobs. CBC male producers earned about 10 percent more than female counterparts.  Toronto Women in Film and Video is a  non-profit organization which promotes the  hiring of women in movies and broadcasting. The $108,000 study surveyed the period 1987-1989.

Nevertheless, a strong pro-  woman, feminist response to the RCRT  is essential and women across Canada—  regardless of their level of "expertise"—  should be gearing up now to have our voices  heard.  The commission has called for the submission of briefs addressing any of the six  areas of concern identified as their mandate  (see box). It wUl then hold public hearings across Canada in the fall of 1990 (dates  and locations should be released in AprU)  at which briefs can be presented.  The Royal Commission (see Kinesis,  Nov. 89) wUl inquire into and report on  current and potential medical and scientific  developments related to NRTs, considering  in particular their social, ethical, health,  research, legal and economic implications  and the public interest, recommending what  poUcies and safeguards should be applied.  While aU of this may seem overwhelming  to groups and individuals who lack research  time or dollars, there is help avaUable.  The Canadian Research Institute for the  Advancement of Women (CRIAW), has  put together a kit called "Our Bodies ...  Our Babies?"—a research tool for women  interested in preparing and presenting a  brief to the Royal Commission. The kit is  a good place to begin for individuals or  groups who have never presented a brief  and/or for women who are concerned about  but unfamihar with the issues surrounding NRTs. The kit includes fact sheets  and critical analysis of various technologies; several back up articles such as Marsh  Saxton's "Prenatal Screening and Discriminatory Attitudes Towards Disabled People;" information about initiating and facU-  itating a discussion on NRTs; step-by-step  guidelines for action research, lobbying and  preparation of a brief; and resource information.  In addition, CRIAW has created a more  What the Commission will study  The Royal Commission on Reproductive Technologies wiU examine in particular:  • Implications of new reproductive technologies for women's reproductive health and weUbeing;  • The causes, treatment and prevention of male and female infertUity;  • Reversals of sterUization procedures, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, embryo transfers, prenatal screening and diagnostic techniques, genetic manipulation and  therapeutic interventions to correct genetic anomalies, sex selection techniques, embryo  experimentation and fetal tissue transplants;  • Social and legal arrangements, such as surrogate chUdbearing, judicial interventions during gestation and birth, and "ownershp" of ova, sperm, embryos and fetal tissue;  • The status and rights of people using or contributing to reproductive services, such as  access to procedures, "rights" to parenthood, informed consent, status of gamete donors  and confidentiality, and the impact of these services on aU concerned parties, particularly the chUdren; and  • The economic ramifications of these technologies, such as the commercial marketing of  ova, sperm and embryos, the application of patent law, and the funding of research and  procedures, including infertUity treatment.  in-depth research tool caUed Reproductive  Technologies and Women. This manual is  bUingual and contains a couple of overview  articles, 47 abstracts of key feminist articles, a bibhography of publications and a  glossary of relevant terms.  There are two things that I particularly  hke about the kit: it impresses on us that  the issues surrounding NRTs are ones that  threaten the rights of all women and questionably benefit a very few; and the information in the kit is basic but sufficient to  get anyone prepared to write a brief.  KeUy Maier of the B.C. Association of  Social Workers is an activist around NRTs.  She beUeves women must be encouraged to  overcome "fears that they haven't possibly  got anything to say. The most important  thing is [we need briefs] from every woman's  perspective", as weU as from the groups  such as the Disabled Women's Network and  the Legal Education and Action Fund who  wUl research and represent specific perspectives.  Sue Cox, a student in sociology who is  researching NRTs, also expressed concern  that briefs come from aU women: women  with and without fertility problems, women  who are and are not of chUdbearing age, and  women of aU economic brackets. Without  a cross-section of people presenting briefs  we risk being "ghettoized as the women's  groups."  Joy Thompson, a Vancouver health activist adds "We don't want a deep chasm  between femimsts and potential users [of reproductive technologies]." Thompson recognizes that women who are potential users  have a huge and immediate stake in the outcome of this commission process.  In BC, there is some momentum to form  a coaUtion to actively lobby women and  women's groups to prepare briefs, and to  provide networking and resource information. The interest for such a body has been  expressed by Bonnie Waterstone of the Vancouver Status of Women who organized a  panel discussion in February called "NRTs:  In Our Best Interests?"  Support the Lubicon Lake Cree  by Kinesis Writer  Lubicon Lake Cree women are calling  on women across Canada to support their  quest for a just land claim settlement.  The Lubicon Lake Cree's land claim in  southern Alberta received widespread attention two summers ago—50 years after  the struggle officially began. After months  of road blockades and media attention,  a deal was struck in October 1988 between Alberta premier Don Getty and Chief  Bernard Ominayak. The Grimshaw Agreement, which set aside an adequate amount  of land for a reserve, was then forwarded to  the federal government for approval.  Ottawa instead presented a "take it or  leave it offer" which faUed to provide the  Lubicon people with the capabihty to once  again become sociaUy and economically independent. The federal offer, which included housing and a school, doesn't commit any money to training and development  programs. The Lubicon Lake Cree have said  the offer "would ensure we remain forever  dependent on welfare to support ourselves,  and upon outsiders to manage and provide  for us."  Negotiations are stiU in process, and the  Lubicon Lake Cree women are requesting  the help of Kinesis readers to ensure a future for their chUdren and their community.  Lubicon Lake Cree women support the  land claim struggle because a just settlement would make it possible for their community to become self-sufficient and to care  for its elders and youth. In order to buUd  this community, the Lubicon Lake Cree  require running water, a community-run  school, recreation facUities, a chUdcare centre, housing, a laundromat, a nursing home  for elders and employment opportunities.  Despite a disinformation campaign about  the federal offer, apparently designed and  fostered with the Prime Minister's consent,  the Lubicon Lake Cree are determined to  press their demands.  The request for solidarity was issued  through the Aboriginal Rights Support  Group in Calgary. Said spokesperson Rosemary Brown, "the strength of the women's  movement in Canada depends upon our wUl  to aid each other ... We responded when  Aboriginal women demanded that they not  lose status when 'marrying out.' We must  respond this time, too."  Write to Prime Minister Mulroney  and demand a response from him directly; also send a copy to your MP:  Parliament Buildings, Ottawa, ONT  KlA 1A2. Let the Lubicon Lake Cree  women know you support their struggle by sending copies of your letters to  the Aboriginal Rights Support Group,  Committee Against Racism, P.O.

At this meeting a number of women who  represent a wide range of perspectives on  NRTs agreed that they would hke to meet  again in a few months. This meeting would  bring together groups and individuals who  are preparing briefs to share information,  insure that aU aspects of the commission's  mandate have been addressed, and see if  there are any major conflicts in terms of recommendations.  Maier also thinks some coordinated activity is necessary but voiced concern about  the shortage of funds, especially given the  recent cuts to women's centres. Shelley  Hines of the Vancouver Women's Health  CoUective echoed this concern. She said  the Health CoUective simply does not have  the funds, the woman power or the office  space for coordinating activities, although  they would be quite wUUng to (continue to)  house and provide resource material.  AUison Rice, a UBC School of Nursing  professor, when asked about local organizing suggested that a survey be done of local facUities to establish what technologies  are avaUable in British Columbia, how frequently are they used, to what purpose and  with what success rate, complications, etc.,  by contacting the people who are doing the  work.  At the panel discussion on NRTs a hst  of possible questions for discussion was circulated and the final floater was "What  would a holistic, women-centred, women-  directed approach to reproduction involve?"  This question was what many women felt  most compeUed to discuss. It wUl not be  asked by a Royal Commission on Reproductive Technologies, but it is the kind of question we must keep in our minds as we work  towards the commission hearings—and beyond them.

KINESIS Across Canada  Funding scrapped  Less and less for more children  by Lisa Schmidt  The 1980s came and went, and along with  them, our hopes for a national strategy on  chUd care soared and crashed.  A report issued in 1984 by the Royal  Commission on Equahty in Employment  concluded that chUd care was a necessity  and recommended that the government take  action to prevent a problematic child care  situation from becoming a full blown crisis.  Two years later, the Katie Cooke Task  Force on ChUd Care published the results of  a two-year study that reaffirmed the need  for government action towards creating a  national pohcy on chUd care.  Another report appeared in 1987, this  time prepared by the Special Committee on  ChUd Care; again the same conclusions were  reached.  Yet apart from issuing reports on the urgency of the chUd care situation in Canada,  the federal government has done httle in  terms of addressing the growing demand for  accessible and affordable care for children.  Some subsidies and tax breaks for low income famiUes were introduced but these do  nothing to meet the demand for day care  spaces.  In 1989 the Tories reneged on their election promise of a national program. Their  excuse: deficit reduction. Now, in their 1990  budget, more blows have been dealt to parents and kids needing chUd care.  The ChUd Care Initiatives Fund has been  cut by $1.75 million. The fund is the government's only program which seeks to address  chUd care needs, especially in rural communities, among Aboriginal and Inuit famiUes  and for special needs chUdren. Last year,  208 projects were funded, mainly dealing  with research and demonstration services.  (The fund was never used to buUd and operate new day care spaces.)  Perhaps more significant than the fund's  erosion is the restricting of federal transfer  payments to British Columbia, Alberta and  Ontario. Transfer payments from the federal government are used by the provinces  to maintain and develop social services—  including welfare and child care. The three  provinces by Ottawa's reckoning"wealthy"  enough to withstand the restriction—wiU  now be able to plead poverty as a justification for eUminating or simply failing to improve chUd care services.  MeanwhUe, many Canadian famiUes eh-  gible for subsidies are unable to get them  because there are so few day care spaces  avaUable for their chUdren. In BC alone,  300,000 chUdren are in need of chUd care  services but only 20,000 hcensed spaces exist.  The lack of spaces is only part of the  issue. Low salaries and less-than-perfect  working conditions keep people from becoming care providers for chUdren.  Peter Ashmore, the Resource and Information Coordinator for the Westcoast ChUd  Care Resource Centre, beUeves that funds  for the training and recruitment of staff  are equaUy as important as the creation of  spaces.  "Even if the funding was there to cre  ate the buUdings," says Ashmore, "without  funds for training we wiU stiU have nothing."  There is no easy solution. The Social  Credit government's interest in working  with corporations to create some of the  needed spaces wiU not make day care more  affordable for the vast majority of Canadians nor wiU it address the chUd care needs of  people who are not employed by large corporations.  "Many of us beheve that [corporate daycare] is only part of a comprehensive daycare strategy," says Ashmore. "Even large  corporations can only meet a portion of  their employees needs."

KINESIS SSS/////SS//SS/////S///S////S//////S/S////S//S/S/S/S/S//SSJ  ///////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////^^^^^  International  Not as workers:  Women protected as "fetal vessels  n  by Kinesis Writer  An American court decision described as  "the most important sex discrimination case  in any court since 1964" could result in barring women from many high-paying industrial jobs.  Since the decision last November, the  Johnson Controls Company of Wisconsin  has a right to bar aU women of chUd-bearing  age from jobs that might expose them to  dangerous levels of lead. A judge who dissented from the ruhng by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said if the decision  is carried to its logical conclusion, "twenty  miUion industrial jobs could be closed to  women."  "The ruhng basicaUy upholds the idea  that women are fetal vessels for their entire Uves-untU they prove otherwise," said  Joan Bertin of the American CivU Liberties Union. She argues that fetal protection  rules are part of a profound backlash against  women who are seen to be "deserting" their  role as guardians of the unborn.  Many organizations, including the National Organization for Women and Planned  Parenthood, are supporting a move by the  union at Johnson Controls to file an appeal  of the case to the US Supreme Court.  The United Auto Workers (UAW) argues  the company should make the jobs safe for  both women and men. Johnson Controls  makes lead batteries. Exposure to lead is  harmful to women and men, and potentiaUy  damaging for their offspring. The UAW beheves that barring only women from these  jobs is discrimination.  According to a brief issued in support  of the UAW's stance, "Fetal protection pohcies overtly limit, condition or threaten the  employment opportunities of aU women, regardless of their chUdbearing intentions, because they reflexively accept the unfounded  stereotypes that aU women inevitably bear  chUdren and are at constant risk of doing  so, that women are the only appropriate  objects of pohcies designed to protect the  health of future generations, that women's  employment rights can and should be sacrificed to attain this goal, and that alternatives to discrimination need not be explored."  Women are stiU free to work in many  jobs in which they are exposed to hazardous  or toxic substances—the low-paying ones.  There have been no moves to keep women  from being dry cleaners, pottery painters,  dental technicians and other jobs that expose them to substances that are potentiaUy  dangerous to both woman and fetus.  South Korean justice:  According to Mary Becker, a professor at  the University of Chicago Law School, fetal  protection legislation for weU-paying jobs  "didn't exist untU the 1970's, when women  started to move into these jobs." General  Motors, DuPont, B.F. Goodrich, Guff OU  and American Cyanamid have aU restricted  certain jobs from women because of fetal  protection poUcies.  Although the Seventh Circuit Court of  Appeals ruhng is binding only in three US  states, it wiU give support to all US employers who want to keep women from certain  jobs. Only four judges of an 11-member, aU  male panel opposed the November ruUng.  Source: New Directions for Women  Ten years for crossing a border  by Kinesis Writer  Rim Su Gyong  Poland:  A 21-year-old South Korean woman was  recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for  attending the 13th World Festival of Youth  and Students in North Korea last summer.  A South Korean law forbids travel to North  Korea (the Democratic People's Repubhc of  Korea).  Rim Su Gyong and her "co-conspirator"  Moon Gyo Hyon were found guilty of fomenting protests against the American and  South Korean governments and of militarily  aiding North Korea by providing information about dissidents and opposition movements in South Korea. Moon, a Catholic  priest, was sentenced to eight years.  Rim's ordeal started when she attended  Church in Solidarity  with fetus, not women  by Kinesis Writer  For the second time in a year, feminists  in Poland are speaking out against proposed  legislation that would ban aU abortions.  The bUl, which first surfaced in 1989 but  was dropped before the elections last June,  has been reintroduced recently by Solidarity members in the Senate. It would outlaw  aU abortions, including those needed to save  a woman's Ufe and in rape and incest cases.  Women and doctors who defy the law could  face up to three years in prison.  Jolanta Plakwiez of the Pohsh Feminist  Association has described the avaUabUity of  abortion as an aspect of communism not yet  discredited. For years, women in most eastern European states have enjoyed relatively  unfettered access to abortion.  All that may be changing in Poland. The  parliament (Sejm) has stopped core funding to family planning centres which may  now face closure. The abortion bUl was petitioned by 37 of the 100 member Senate,  aU but one of whom represents Solidarity. The influence of the CathoUc church in  Solidarity—and Pohsh society in general-  is a key to the changes.  Solidarity and the CathoUc church have  been closely aligned in the struggle against  state communism, but Plakwiez beheves the  party faithful wUl not necessarUy support  the church's involvement in the abortion issue. Solidarity leaders are expected to put  off debate on the proposed legislation for as  long as possible—in order to avoid the pohtical fight which wUl ensue.

After traveUing 10 days through West  Germany and Japan to reach the Festival,  Rim signed a joint statement with student  leaders there calling for students from both  North and South Korea to work for peaceful reunification. The dividing hne between  the two Koreas was drawn by the United  Nations after the Second World War. Today, about 45,000 US troops remain permanently stationed in South Korea, along  with a vast arsenal of conventional and nuclear weapons. A US general maintains operational control over most of South Korea's  600,000 troops.  After the World Festival, Rim publicly  stated that she planned to cross the border from North Korea to South Korea on  July 27, the 36th anniversary of the end of  the war in Korea which resulted in the continued North and South divisions. Realizing that Rim was putting her hfe in danger,  the Korean Association of Catholic Priests  for Social Justice sent Moon to accompany  Rim on her border crossing.  After the US Army refused Rim and  Moon's request to return home, the two  went on a hunger strike.

A member of the  Federation of Transvaal Women (FED-  TRA W), Duarte was one of thousands  of people detained during the repression of the late 80s. She visited Canada  again this March, a guest of External  Affairs. Her message: all is not well in  South Africa, despite what the SA government may want us to believe.  Duarte's stop-over in Vancouver was  unscheduled and brief. Louie Ettling  taped this interview "on the fly."  For myself, a lot has happened. I spent  eight months in detention, eight very long  months from March 17,1988 to December 2,  1988. My detention happened a year after I  was here. First, when I went back into South  Africa from Canada I was stopped and questioned about my visit: what were my Unks  with the African National Congress (ANC),  was the ANC active in Canada and how—  aU that sort of thing.  I was very honest, wanting them [the  South African government] to understand  the strength of the ANC. [The South  African government] placed a restriction order on me that lasted untU June 1987. I  was also placed on the hst of people that  were "co-conspirators" in the Delmas treason trial, two years after they arrested everyone else.  In 1987 they restricted me for a second time. They Ufted those restrictions in  November 1989.1 thought, weU maybe they  decided to ease off. But no, they actuaUy  became much more repressive. EventuaUy  they just detained me in 1988.  It wasn't easy. No detention is easy, particularly if it is without trial. You have no  right to challenge them. You can't see anybody. The only people you see are them. I  did see my lawyer occasionaUy, but he was  powerless too. I was detained in terms of  Section 31 under the State of Emergency,  which is for the protection of the communities. I'm considered to be a security threat,  which I think is absolutely ridiculous. Nevertheless, I came out of detention and was  restricted immediately, as I was released.  That is so hard on people, emotionaUy  and psychologicaUy. I had to be home every day between 6 pm and 6 am: so, I was  house-arrested at night. I wasn't aUowed to  leave Johannesburg without the permission  of the commissioner of pohce. I am not allowed to speak to more than 10 people at a  time. I am not aUowed to speak at any university campus.  Like many other people, I've just derestricted myself and have done aU those  things. And there hasn't been a foUow-up. I  don't know what they wUl do.  Let's talk about what has happened inside South Africa since the last time I  was in Vancouver in 1986. We saw the  most extreme period in terms of repression from 1986 to 1989—we estimate more  than 60,000 people were detained at one  time or another. There was the advent of  the hit squads, and people disappearing—  people who have never been found. We have  seen pohtical changes too, in terms of the  nationalist party government shifting some  of its focus towards power sharing. But beheve me, it's more a situation where they  would stiU retain control and we are not  happy with that.  At the same time, there has been an absolute right-wing upsurge within the country. And just to make things more complex, a much more confident black majority. [There is] more confident support for  the trade union movement which has consolidated its forces, and our understanding,'  of working class leadership [is] emerging in  very clear terms. There is also an understanding of the kind of economic position we  would Uke to buUd that would give the people more benefits than what investors would  hke to have, a position that is not very popular with many outside investors, but we are  going to work very hard for that.  For me the most significant change has  been the unbanning of the ANC and the release of Nelson Mandela. That has been very  good for us.  Ensuring Democracy  What is happening in South Africa now  is deep-rooted organization of the ANC  at street committee level and at township  level. There is also a much more deep understanding of the non-racial aspect of our  society and an integration of Black and  white people into developing a society that  is going to be non-racial. Democratic [pohtical] practices have begun to emerge more  solidly: a criticism of centraUzed democracy,  an understanding that there must be cen-  . tralization but also democracy.  We've also learned a lot from the eastern European situation, which hasn't in any  way affected our resolve to develop a socialist society. It is in the socialist world where  [there is] the kind of action that shows that  nothing is sacred. One can criticize and then  grow out of that criticism. So we don't see  what is happening in eastern Europe as negative, but as an advance for socialism.  What I have seen in Canada since I arrived has been incredible: talking to people on the plane, everybody thinking that  socialism has faUed. It's hard to explain to  someone you meet for the first time that  it has not faUed, that it is just developing  into a more open approach, much more so  than in a capitalist society. It is much more  guarded here: I mean, if we have to challenge the whole way in which the rich milked  the west, it wouldn't be easy. It is so deep-  rooted. Maybe one day we wUl.  In South Africa there's a very grassroots  understanding of that sort of development.  It's come from the trade union movement.  And I must tell you that I'm an absolute  behever of organized labour. I beheve that  it is one way of ensuring democracy, partic-'  ipation.  We have not accepted entirely the position that [President F.W.] de Klerk is  putting forward. We beheve that he is doing what he's doing to appease international  concerns. The release of Nelson Mandela  was "popular." It got tied up with South  Africa's economic position as weU: "We'll  give you the money for the loans you need  if you release Mandela," I also think that  Mandela is just a remarkable man, he's absolutely wonderful. My generation of people  really see him as a person of absolute leadership qualities. The respect for him and  some of the other leaders is unquestioned. I  think that the support for the ANC is now  stronger than ever before.  When I was in Canada before people  asked "What about the violence between  the different tribes?" That doesn't exist  over the country. In Kwazmu there is some  [violence] because there is a particular situation there and the regime has exploited that  to the fullest. But it doesn't exist in terms  of ordinary folks on the ground who want to  free South Africa. And we saw that when  Mandela was released. Everybody went to  the "Welcome Home" raUies—thousands,  miUions of people. So, I think that we've  [the ANC] actuaUy succeeded in asserting  our position within the country. HopefuUy  the international community wUl accept our  leadership. We would hke to cooperate with  the world, but not at the expense of our own  beliefs.  I think there is a lot of room for people  to participate in the free South Africa situation.  There has  been an  absolute right-  wing upsurge  within the  country...and  a much more  confident  Black  majority  Women's Reality  There has been a lot of development with  women. Since 1984 new women's organizations have emerged and we now have weU-  organized regional organizations in South  Africa, The major focus has been the uplifting and development of women, both as  individuals and as a collective.  South African women have had the experience, fortunately for us and unfortunately  for the people we've had to learn from,  of looking at other hberation movements  and seeing what happened to women after,  that they were just not "given their space".  They were accorded this role of secretaries,  a "woman's secretariat," anything but complete integration into the mainstream of the  society on a pohtical and economic level. We  are saying: we don't want that. We don't  want anyone to say that we are being represented by the "women's sector." We say:  "No, as women we have the right to participate on aU levels of the society, as equals.  Politically, economically, individuaUy."  At the same time we accept and understand that we wUl have to continue to fight  for the freedom of women from cultural  and traditional roles, which are very deep-  rooted in most of Southern Africa. There's  a specific understanding of the role of the  woman as mother, chUd, homemaker. It defies the reality though, for the reality is that  most women—certainly in my part of the  country—are single parents. The men went  to the mines and didn't come back, which  is an epidemic of the apartheid structure.  There's a matriarchal society in the  home. The woman makes the decisions and  the pohcies in the home. Outside of it, she  has no power. Legislation itself undermines  women. And the very first law that we [wiU  change] after we take power, is the law that  women are stiU accorded the status of a  chUd in South Africa. You become the ward  of your husband or your oldest son.  Then we are also challenging things Uke  Lobola (bride price) which is very much  an African issue, not just a South African  one. It does result in women being maltreated. If you "bought" someone you can  do what you want with your purchased  goods. There are psychological problems attached to that for us as women; wife and  women abuse is an issue we tackle head-on  inside the country. We've recently stepped  up campaigning against rape. We've got  the "people against women abuse" organization, which has begun to have tremendous  success. There was a tremendous amount  of scepticism when they started out, because people felt that these were the ultra-  left femimsts, you know. But really, there  is no such thing in South Africa, These are  women fighting for women to be seen as  equal.  Honestly, we have many difficulties as  women. We don't have many women in  power, in decision-making bodies, not even  in the ANC. I think there are too few  women. In the USF there is one woman on  the National Executive Committee, and on  the regional executive committees of each  USF. Women are often represented as a  sector. No woman is elected as a president/treasurer or secretary. Unbeheveable!  What we are doing at the moment is we  have undergone a tremendous amount of  "dual education," as we call it.  Powerful Union for Domestics  The one thing we've begun to look at is—  should women be organized separately? We  say yes, because our situation is special  in Africa. We want to develop into confident people, for the society wUl not do it  for us. The capitaUst apartheid society in  fact discourages that. Women are so far  down the ladder: we are almost a separate class of people, below at times, what  would be known as the "working class."  We have fewer opportunities than anyone  else. I speak particularly, of course, of Black  women.  There have been a lot of achievements,  though. The South African Domestic Workers Union has become a very powerful organ in a constituency where women are traditionally maltreated by other women. So,  it's not only attacking the thing that men do  to women, but also the things that women  do to each other and themselves.  Secondly, we have also managed to organize successfuUy around basic issues such  as chUdcare. And we've come a long way.  We've organized our own publications [such  as] "Out Mama," nursery rhymes putting  women forward. Moving away from Tristan and Isolde, Cinderella, The Riding  Hoods and the Big, Bad Wolf. It just  isn't relevant to South Africa, We are moving towards giving chUdren the opportunity  to express themselves in a language which  is non-sexist. Saying: mothers are as equal  as fathers, and both have the responsibU-  ity to raise me as a chUd. And our curriculum in the daycare centres of Federation of Transvaal Women are based on popular education, on giving chUdren the freedom to become critical thinkers, which the  Department of Education and Training denies us. Giving chUdren the absolute knowledge that, whether they're male or female,  they can be confident human beings. And  they really are that.  Women are very good at campaigning.  We are very active in the civic organizations on the ground, which really is the key  to our abihties. The Soweto rent boycott,  for instance, is an example of this kind of  work. People have reached the stage where  they could confront the local government  authority on the whole question of a one  tax pay system for Johannesburg, which  Soweto is part of. While you work in Johannesburg and pay taxes there, your community doesn't benefit from it. Women were in  the forefront of this particular struggle. We  have taken a lot of lead roles.  The education struggle, health and  welfare—you name it. Nurses have been  organized very successfuUy with doctors  into the South African Health Workers  Congress. A very progressive understanding of health care work has emerged—away  from that understanding that the hospital  is the only place where people can be cured,  based on the old British system. Women  play a very important role in looking at traditional healthcare. Many traditional healers are women and now we look back at  that tradition. We have more faith in that.  A lot of people want to write it off as  "witchcraft": it's actually using every resource that nature and the community has  to offer.  On education: many people, from 1985  to now have become internal refugees; particularly young people, aged 9-20. They left  their homes because of pohce harassment  and have migrated towards cities. We estimate in Johannesburg alone that there are  at least 15,000 such students. We have developed what we caU street schools, through  the help of the church. All the teaching is  done voluntarily. People with professional  skiUs then come after work and give input.  We are now saying to anyone who is wUling  to give that kind of support—if you want  to come to South Africa, we wUl be happy.  But it has to be done formaUy, through the  ANC. People have to understand that they  have to communicate with us through legitimate channels if they want to assist.  Twenty-thousand Prisoners  Many people are stiU in prison. There is a  woman by the name of Jennifer Schreiner  who is charged on two counts of terror  ism. She's a white woman. Many people  think that white people don't go to jaU  for apartheid activities, but there are many  women, [in jaU] especially these days. In the  case of Jennifer, we would Uke people to  make a special appeal for her release because she's in jaU because of her poUtical be-  Uefs. We view her as a freedom fighter. We  are concerned because she is isolated from  [the people arrested with her] because they  are all Black and she is left alone on the  other side. It's not a good situation for her.  Having been in prison myself I know what  it is Uke—and she's been in prison for three  years.  When I was there, people that I met in  Canada had organized a campaign for me.  It was very, very heartening when this came  to my attention. Jenny is waiting for a trial  that is dragging on and on.  The government is hiding that there is  stiU this repression, the fact that the laws of  apartheid are stiU very much intact. The Internal Security Act the Suppression of Communists Act, the Group Areas Act, the Separate Education Act, aU are stiU there. And  so is the state of emergency. People have  to look beyond what de Klerk says with his  mouth and look at whether there is content  in the motion. Is he moving just to appease  the international community or is there poUtical movement inside the country.  Our view is that he is not moving poUt-  icaUy at aU. There are stUl poUtical trials  going on. Twenty thousand people are said  to be stUl waiting to be tried. We say, if the  government is sincere, let them scrap aU of i  that. Release aU poUtical prisoners. AU ex-  Ues must be able to come home without fear  that they wUl be detained. Our demands for  a future South Africa are not going to be  negotiated from a position of weakness. We  definitely talk from a position of strength.  We beUeve that we—especially the ANC—  have that strength at home.

Even our so-called "pop culture" is a corporate fantasy fabrication orchestrated by large companies hke RCA.  Poor people are invisible in this culture. Television and film bland portrayals  of white couples on the rise does not represent the real demographics of our society.  Where are the people who are poor? Not  only are we invisible in mainstream culture,  we do not have economic access to it. What  often separates poor people from culture is  the cost of a ticket. Some people have it, we  don't.  Because we are excluded from mainstream culture, we have to create our own  culture. Through culture making, we reinforce our own experience as poor people. We  articulate our analysis creatively and passionately.  To hven up a recent End Legislated  Poverty (ELP) conference in Vancouver,  poverty activists brought along our own culture.

Grant  On March 14, the Vancouver Status of  Women sponsored an evening called New  Ideas for a New Decade, focusing on some  of the issues of concern to women of colour.  The audience was treated to plays, skits and  dialogues by three groups: Colours, a representative from Aquelarre magazine, and the  women's caucus of the South Asia Student  Association. Feminism and poUtical change  was the evening's stated theme—how, as  women of colour we need to verbalize for  ourselves what these issues are and also  make the mainstream women's movement  aware of our issues.  "As women of colour we are often silenced. Someone wUl make a remark that  makes you so angry that you just shut up,"  Through a series of skits and a mock television talk show, Colours demonstrated and  analyzed some effects of racism. Two women  role-played a scene that is aU too famiUar to  many women of colour. A woman of colour  and a white woman are introduced to each  other. Upon hearing the woman of colour's  name, the white woman immediately tries  to shorten it, to make it Enghsh- sounding.  This is such an affront: it is saying, "I wUl  only accept you on my terms ... I wUl Uke  you if you become more Uke me." Suggesting we should change our names shows a  complete disregard for us.  This lack of validation for the woman of  colour is also seen in the women's movement. Another woman in Colours pointed  out, "frequently organizations that are pri-  marUy white assume that we have the same  Women of  colour need  to develop  our own  language  said a member of Colours. Her words rang  true for me: you get so tired of being patient  and understanding—at least I do. I have  gotten so angry, but haven't known what to  do with that anger so I have been sUent a  lot in my Ufe. What is causing this anger?  It is the daily barrage of insults, racial jokes  and lack of respect that must be dealt with.  It is often the smaU irritants that are the  most maddening and frustrating.  agenda." A round table discussion foUowed  about what could be done to make the  mainstream women's movement more aware  of our agenda. Most agendas are made to fit  the majority but there are always some people who don't fit on this agenda. A member  of Colours commented that the first step in  making people aware of our agenda is for  them to listen to what we have to say. It  was also pointed out that women of colour  -^  Canadian woman studies  les cahiers de la femme/-  cws/cf  Feminist Quarterly  • 100-page   beautifully   illustrated   forum   for  education, advocacy and change  • articles on current issues, theory and action  • each issue examines a topic specific to women's  experiences and concerns  Please enclose cheque or money-order for $22 payable to Canadian Woman Studies foryour yearly subscription (4 issues).

M3J 1P3  need to develop our own language since our  way of speaking is part of who we are as  people.  WMte people often define how to speak,  said a woman in Colours. Their attitude is  that if you do not meet their criteria, then  you don't speak weU enough. As women of  colour we need to be proud of ourselves and  our cultures. The women in Colours were  Constanza SUva, Terrie Hamazaki, LesUe  Komori, Chris Itahim, Eileen Kage, Raven,  Bonnie Fabian, SybUa Valdivieso and Sonia  Marino.  The second presentation was by Carmen Rodriguez and Magaly Varas, two  founders of the magazine Aquelarre. (The  name means "Ulegal gathering of witches.")  Aquelarre formed because Latin American women needed to have their own way  of expressing who they are and what their  desires and dreams are. Rodriguez and  Varas pointed out that most Latin American women came to Canada for poUtical  reasons, whereas other groups frequently  came here for a better way of Ufe. Latin  American women came with plans to go  back home once the poUtical cUmate in their  countries changed.In Canada, the agenda of  their groups was to help other Latin women  with Ufe's necessities: where to buy good  food when you only have a Uttle money, for  example.  They operated and governed themselves  this way untU the men got involved and told  them to be more "pohticaUy active."  The women then found themselves with  a complete lack of power in their own  groups—men had aU the power. And when  they tried to become involved in the mainstream women's movement, they felt out of  place. Finally they realized that, as Latin  American women, they needed to create  their own space: they could not continue in a  state of submissiveness. Both feminism and  it was for the mainstream to find out about  them.  The women from the South Asia Student  Association were Sunera Thobani, Darshan  Mann, Sutinder Sanna, Jyoti Sanghera, Raj  Pannu and Amarat Pannun. They used skits  to reveal a variety of experiences they face  as South Asian women. They explored the  fact that women's studies often treat women  of colour as objects or as if they were exotic creatures. To Ulustrate this point, they  played out a very poignant scene which concerned a white woman's studies professor  who felt she was quite hberal because she  had a young woman of colour working for  her. This particular professor hked to teU  everyone that the "girl" was Uke a member of the famUy. Despite the exceUent rapport this woman claimed, she talked to the  woman of colour as though she was very  backward and could not comprehend even  the simplest details.  The group pointed out that, frequently,  their ceremonies were not respected by  mainstream women's groups but were instead seen as backward, whUe the ceremonies practiced by white women were seen  as progressive. And they acted out a scene  that dealt with the same subject as a scene  by Colours. It started with the classic Une,  the one aU women of colour are famiUar  with. You know, the one that starts by asking, "So ... where are you from?"  If you happen to reply something stupid  Uke "Canada" the inquisitor keeps on q  tioning untU they find out where "you are  really from." You know, where your parents are from—and if that doesn't give the  expected response, they wUl go down your  famUy tree untU they receive a satisfactory  From my own experience, when people  continue asking me where I am from, I  start thinking I must look Uke I don't be-  ...the classic line,  the one all  women of colour  [know]: "so,  where are  you from?"  a desire for a better Ufe could be expressed  poUticaUy, they discovered.  Varas and Rodriguez pointed out that  although leftist Latin men say men and  women are equal, it is only a theory. Aquelarre gives them a chance to discuss these  concerns. The women want a revolution, but  women's issues have to be dealt with now  and the revolution could not be aUowed to  take precedence over women's issues. Varas  and Rodriguez stressed that it was necessary for mainstream women's groups to talk  to them and keep the hnes of communication open. Communication is essential, they  said, because it is easier to find out what is  going on in the mainstream movement than  long here. Then I ask myself, what would I  have to look Uke for people to feel I looked  Uke a Canadian? I wUl not accept that I  have to be white to be a part of this country. I think that getting together and talking about these issues helps lessen the isolation and alienation you feel as a woman of  colour. You realize that you are not alone.  Getting together and talking about our  feelings also takes away the ahenation. I  did not feel as alone after the March 14  evening and I feel that this kind of dialogue  is essential: it lets you know that other people are going through the same thing you  are. It is this kind of dialogue we need if we  are to gather strength and gain power.  KINESIS <s*^*^^^*^^^^^  ARTS  Peacemongerers among us  Canadian women:  by Tarel Quandt  UP AND DOING:  Canadian Women and Peace  ed. by Janice WUliamson  and Deborah Gorham  Toronto: Women's Press, 1989  • Up and Doing: Canadian Women  and Peace is an anthology which explores  the involvement in and ideas of Canadian  women about peace. Its contributors are  Canadian activists, storyteUers, writers, poets and academics, whose many perspectives are woven together.  The book is divided into four areas. First,  women's involvement in peace is historicaUy  contexted. Two middle sections discuss current feminist peace analysis and peace activism. The book concludes by offering images of peace through poetry and prose.  An Impressive Heritage  Canada has an impressive heritage of female peace activism. In the first part of this  century, women such as Francis Benyon,  Laura Hughes, NeUie McClung, Violet Mc-  Naughton, Alice Loeb, Laura Jamieson (and  the hst goes on) devoted much of their Uves  working for peace.  Their commitment to peace and their  analysis of war led them to develop a broad  understanding of social injustice. They understood war as rooted in the desire for  power and money, and forms of oppression  became visible: sexism, racism, capitahsm.  These women hnked warfare to the prevalent social injustices which existed: as Nellie McClung said, "war is but that daUy injustice writ large."  Many women's commitment to justice  stemmed from their behef in Christianity.  But whUe Christianity gave them the impetus to struggle for peace, maternal feminism was their theoretical framework. A  prevalent assumption among many of these  activists was that women were inherently  more peaceful because of their potential to  mother. They concluded it was necessary  to embrace women's ideas and incorporate  them into society's decision-making process  in order to create peace.  WhUe women were organizing for peace  in Canada, women globaUy were doing the  same. By the early 1920s an aU-female international organization committed to promoting peace was developed. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom  (WILPF) stUl continues this struggle today.  Thinking Peace  Current feminist theories of peace and war  maintain many of the insights of our fore-  sisters' analyses, but the concept of maternal feminism has been rehnquished by  many. It has been replaced with an understanding that women's and men's tendencies towards peace or war are culturaUy  created rather than inherently acquired.  As one contributor stresses "[women] have  no special virtue." Women's connection to  peace is due to their specific historical circumstances as caregivers and relationship-  focused. Peacefulness is not an intrinsic female quahty.  In this section the militarization of our  society is a major theme. Many of the authors examine how the pubUc is being brainwashed into accepting the growing miUtary  presence in our Uves.  Ideology of the new right which fosters  the understanding of the universe as good  vs bad plays a critical role. This prevalent  attitude polarizes issues into black/white,  us/them leaving no room for concepts of  cooperation or negotiation. The new right  phUosophy justifies the existence of a powerful military. Anyone disagreeing with our  nation is wrong—the enemy—and therefore  must be destroyed.  Gender stereotypes, embraced by the new  right, are the organizational keys which  "con" the pubhc into accepting miUtariza-  tion. According to prevailing gender ideology, in order for a male to be worth-  whUe he must be "mascuhne"—read powerful, tough, aggressive, unyielding. Any other  behaviour is weak (feminine) and must be  rejected.  The best way to prove one's masculinity  is to own lots of violent weapons. This is  true for the individual male and the collective male (the government, the military).  The pubhc is programmed by multiple medias to buy into this mythology.  Movies, action/adventure fiction, advertisements in soldier magazines and pohtical  rhetoric propagate the mascuhne (virile,  potent, menacing) image of the warrior  e.g. Rambo. The images of hypermuscular,  white, male heros brutally murdering hundreds of people is commonplace in popular  entertainment.  Terror has become so famihar to us that  we have been conditioned to accept it in our  hves. Therefore, instead of revolting against  the buUd-up of nuclear arms the public has  given into this danger as a part of 20th century hfe.

Those making the  decisions about warfare utilize the objective, rational, realistic method of thinking—  the mascuhne form. Reahty is perverted.  War is discussed in terms of balance sheets,  statistical information, maps, evaluation of  profit. The kiUing of millions of people is  quantified into units. This form of decisionmaking uses "hard facts," the only important facts.  To ponder the inhumanity of the acts of  war is to be subjective, ineffectual, feminine.  In the attempts to be mascuhne, males disconnect themselves from the reaUties of Ufe  replacing them with facts and figures which  are valued in the male domain of power.  Acting for Peace  Contributors to this section Ulustrate that  acting for peace raises many difficult questions. While much effort has been spent examining and criticizing war in its entirety,  meanings of peace seem quite elusive. Voices  throughout this section ask, "what does  peace mean?" Interestingly, many of them  rely on Christian ideology to understand  peace.  "Bannmg the bomb" or "Peace is the antithesis of war" is too simplistic. As many  contributors stressed, peace means much  more than simply taking away war toys.  They urge the readers to focus discussions  on peace because we need to learn what it  is that we really want. The Utopian ideal of  a happy world is not helpful.  As aU of us develop fuller meanings (not  absolutes) of peace, methods for promoting  our visions wUl become clearer. We wUl have  a better conceptual framework with which  to evaluate our actions in pacifism, civU dis-  ■a obedience and direct actions (such as the  1  Litton "  * This book provides an interesting in-  I troduction to women's peace activism in  1 Canada.

It is an exercise in responsibility,  a self-induced consciousness raiser, and  a good way of enriching one's writing.  Humour always allows you to be a serious writer, and it saves you from being  a grim one.  —Chin Lyvely  Are comic books a vahd form of cultural  expression? My answer is an enthusiastic  "yes!" I've been collecting comic books for  almost a decade and the form has changed  profoundly in that time.  The Comics Code was instituted in North  America in the 1950s to censor comics,  whose audience was seen as mostly chUdren. The Code served to retard the maturing of comics as an art form on this  continent: the Japanese, for example, have  viewed comics as an alternative form of literature for decades.  In the late 1960s "counterculture," there  was an explosion of underground comix.  (They were called "comix" to distinguish  n Wimmen's Comix #14,  them from the mainstream comics.) This  stimulated the growing-up process of the  medium and changed attitudes, so that it  became acceptable for adults to be seen  reading comic books.  However, only a few comix featured work  by women. There were two major reasons  for this. The first was a "boys' club" atmosphere where women weren't welcome. The  second was the sexist and pornographic material which made up the bulk of the under  ground comix. Many women, disgusted by  misogynist content, went no further.  Other women attempted to inject a strain  of feminism into comix. A handful penetrated the club and wrote and Ulustrated  beside the boys. Many of these women appeared in the first aU-woman comix book, It  Ain't Me, Babe, published by California's  first feminist newspaper, of the same name  in 1970. Sales of the publication were respectable enough for some of the women to  start up Wimmen's Comix in 1972. With  a five-year interruption between 1978 and  1983, Wimmen's Comix now comes out  roughly annually with a different theme in  each issue (#12-Fashion, #13-Occult, #14-  Disastrous Relationships, #15-Little Girls).  For female comix artists and readers, the  emergence of Wimmen's Comix and, in  1972, Tits and Clits marked a time of  recognition, and an exploration of their own  stories.  There were difficulties inherent in working in comix and the exclusion of women  by male cartoonists was only one hurdle. There were production problems: when  Chin Lyvely and Joyce Farmer formed Nan-  nygoat Productions to publish Wet Satin,  a comic book of women's erotic fantasies,  the printer refused to print it, even though  he had printed the male Bizarre Sex. His  reason: male sex comics were satires, but  Wet Satin was "serious, and therefore  pornographic."  Men were not the only critics and censors  of women's comix. Many women in the feminist community perceived comix as a masculine form of expression. In 1973, Ms magazine rejected an ad for Wimmen's Comix  because it thought the comix was obscene.  Many feminist bookstores refused to carry  Tits and Clits because they were disgusted  by the material—mostly feminist satires of  sex.  Much of the content of women's comix  is directly sexual, reflecting the origins of  women's comix in underground comix. In  Wimmen's Comix #15, about Uttle girls,  the artists explore growing-up experiences,  from first sexual encounters to the discovery that "by the time I was eight, I knew I'd  never be Uke the other httle girls," (Baby  Butch Dyke.) Tits and Clits #6 contemplates motherhood and the accompanying "growing bewUderment at one's transformed body," as weU as lesbian SM. In  Dynamite Damsels #1, Roberta Gregory  takes a look at the women's movement (our  cornucopia of committees) and coming out  as a lesbian.  There are plenty of reasons to censor  women's comix —almost as many as there  are reasons to censor any kind of art. However women's comix, hke other art, explore  the world in which we must hve. They try,  From It Ain 't Me, Babe, 1970  in an often cynical fashion, to find some humour in it. Often, there is a sense of recognition, of "that's happened to me, too!"  within the pages of women's comix.  It is quite amazing that women's comix  have actuaUy survived. Not only did their  co-artists in the underground discourage  them, but also the feminists to whom they  were trying to tell their stories. And finally, the comics distribution and sales  network was and continues to be completely male-dominated. (Nannygoat Productions, publishers of Tits and Clits,  Wet Satin and Abortion Eve, had to distribute their comix through a distributor  who handled mostly pornography.) Eventu-  aUy, most comics end up in a comic store  which is usually owned and managed by  males, with an almost 90 percent male clientele. Because the managers see no female  customers, they usuaUy do not order anything which looks remotely feminist. (The  exception, in Vancouver, is The Comic Shop  on West Fourth and Arbutus, and they only  order a smaU quantity.)  Today some of those attitudes have  changed. However, back issues of feminist comix, usuaUy weU-thumbed, can only  rarely be found in male-owned comics  stores, usuaUy buried in a box behind  the counter, hidden alongside the Bizarre  Sex and Real Canadian Beaver Comix.  Julie Doucet, in Wimmen's Comix #15,  Comic books continue to be regarded as  lower form of communication, not quite literature and not quite art.  I am often asked why I read women's  comix. I do so because I find them inspirational, almost every time. Whenever I find  a new comix by a woman, I hide away for  half hour or so, no matter what I happen to  be doing or have to do. Within the pages of  Wimmen's Comix, Dynamite Damsels  and  Girl Fight  Comics, I find kindred  Many feminist  bookstores  refuse to carry  "Tits and Clits"  spirits, sharing their hves with me for a  short time. Like me, they are questioning  their relationships, with men and women,  and the roles we play in society. Comics in  general are growing up, and becoming a respectable form of expression in themselves.  In the pages of my women's comix, I find  myself.  One of the biggest problems with  mass media, and perhaps the arts too, is  the lack of relevant content... We have  a lot to say that has not been said, and  there is no reason why we can't use this  material as a basis for our own brand  of humour.  —Chin Lyvely  Comix to look for include:  • Wimmen's Comix— an excellent anthology with work by established and  new women creators.  • Tits and Clits — as enjoyable, but  much harder to find than Wimmen's  Comix  • Anything by Trina Robbins, Roberta  Gregory and Dori Seda  • Good Girls — by Carol Lay  • Rip Off Comix — an anthology  comic which usually has a few works  by women. It also has the advantage of being published relatively frequently, four times a year.  KINESIS sm**^s**s***ssK*^^  ARTS  Skateboard, spider^  sand and safety  by Susan Prosser  PATTERN MAKERS  by Sandy Frances Duncan  Toronto: The Women's Press, 1989  Pattern Makers is a fairy tale. The language of Sandy Frances Duncan's new novel  has a chUdlike simpUcity, but the experience  of three socially damaged women healing  themselves is complex. This novel is a journey of transformation—a journey of three  women, each of whom has through coping,  already distiUed herself into a new being.  Yvonne has escaped from her refrigerator  (where she has been hving and honing her  interior decorating skiUs for months) with  magic powers: unexplored power to materialize or UteraUze her desire. She discovers  her house is rapidly fiUing with sand; anguished, Yvonne leaves home and family to  wander through a desert. Jane wakes one  morning as a turtle and leaves home soon  after when she realizes her husband hasn't  even noticed. They meet on a tiny oasis.  MirabeUe joins the wandering duo when  she loses control of her skateboard, careens  down a hill and splashes into a pond from  which she is rescued by Yvonne. MirabeUe,  1146 Commercial.* 253-0913  _-   FOR  pEMINIST  THE0RY&  ITERATURE  Rctrxacus  BOOKS  311 W. HASTINGS ST. VANCOUVER  V6B1H6 TEL. 688-6138  a doll-Uke torso, has been confined to a  skateboard for days because her fingers, toes  and finaUy Umbs fell off every time "she  committed an act of maternal or wifely self-  sacrifice." She has propeUed herself around  with a vacuum cleaner hose clamped between her teeth. Newly installed on Jane's  back (sheU), MirabeUe is soon convinced to  travel west out of the interior (of B.C., literally, but... ) in search of the ocean. Jane  longs for waving kelp and a herd of turtles.  The trio of women is rounded out by a large  spider which has foUowed Yvonne ever since  they encountered one another in the desert.  Pattern Makers abounds with chUd-  Uke qualities which give it a vividness  rare in my experience of adult Uterature.  This is a departure from Duncan's first  novel Dragon Hunt, which was more experimental: less a fairy tale and more a  play of voice, memory, dream and magic.  It is the magic which Duncan carries over  into the present novel. The issues in Pattern Makers—motherhood and woman-  centred relationships—are painful, but the  metaphors #te embodied, real and brightly  coloured.  I have two quibbles with Pattern Makers. Duncan's characters teU their story  very weU, but the narrator often overrides  their voices or actions by characterizing how  they said or did something. This made the  reading heavy in places. As weU, I resisted  the inclusion of overused chches such as  rainbows and aurora borealis, again because  I felt what was happening at the time was  expressed powerfuUy enough.  Duncan has written several chUdren's  stories. In her article in Room of One's  Own on the nature and present state of  Six women:  chUdren's Uterature she said, "One writes  from some impetus from the chUd in oneself,  writes more to satisfy that part than any  cluld 'out there' ... Because of nostalgia,  rehved memories, recoUections of the original mUieu, subconscious sets of intercon-  nectedness, chUdren's Uterature is slower to  change, is less amenable to innovation than  other genres."  I find it fascinating that not only has  Duncan used exactly these sorts of constructs to create Pattern Makers, she has  retrieved the larger than Ufe quality that  makes fairy tales so compeUing.  But the fairy tale is not only the genre  of Pattern Makers, it is the bones of  the story. Duncan's story is about women  who escape from the reality which underlies  most fairy-tales (as Andrea Dworkin says in  Woman Hating) to a fairy tale in which  they can remake their hves. Duncan takes  process out of the coUective meeting into  the physical and emotional landscape.  On the road one day MirabeUe Ukens  their journey to the Wizard of Oz. Jane  immediately takes her to task and an argument about the value of fairy tales ensues. Jane demands that MirabeUe tell a  story, and MirabeUe says she can't make  up new stories only remember old ones.  Jane asks her to reteU Red Riding Hood  but MirabeUe objects: "Fairy tales are one  of the safe things in the world ... they've  gone on for generations ... they tell the  way the world is. Why must you ruin  it?" When Jane insists, "they're more than  hes, they're crimes," Yvonne mutters, "how  come they're hes? Who wants to he to us  Ues? What's the difference between Ues anc  stories?"  MirabeUe does eventuaUy reteU Red Riding Hood and we find the girl more than  a match for the wolf. And Granny's been  'sleeping' with the woodcutter for years  Pattern Makers is a fantastic(al) account  of how three women break out.  Lives not easily lived  by Shelly Quick  SOUTH OF AN  UNNAMED CREEK  by Anne Cameron  Madeira Park: Harbour, 1989  Women in a male-dominated society  quickly learn that almost everything gained  is gained at the price of compromise with  the patriarchy. In women's hterature these  compromises are often mapped out and  used as testimony for other women. This  charting of the patriarchal terrain is a crucial tool for the women's movement.  Growing awareness, however, can sometimes be overwhelming. If you're feehng a  Uttle overwhelmed right now, you may enjoy  reading Anne Cameron's Klondike novel,  South of an Unnamed Creek. In this book  you wUl meet six women affected by the patriarchy, but by no means beaten by it.  WfttfHKK  SHMTHWM  58Cir2S5«§  Cameron's characters are even more inspiring because they are hving in Canada  during the slightly more oppressive 1890's.  Their roots he in lands as far away as Scotland and China. Their backgrounds are diverse, but aU share the threat of poverty  that society imposes on women who Uve independently of their family and choose not  to marry.  As if to stay in keeping with her characters' unorthodoxy, Cameron tells her story  in an unusual way. The first half of the novel  is broken into six separate narratives to correspond with the six hves of her heroines.  The movement forward is slow and undulating. One woman's Ufe is studied and then  another is foUowed untU aU six women have  been written about. Then, Cameron wUl return to the woman with whom she began  and begin the process again.  This undulating progression is an effective way to hold the readers' interest. Just  as you're becoming interested in one character the chapter wUl end and you have to  read about someone else. At times you may  find yourself wishing that you could read  aU six narratives simultaneously. And the  prospect of seeing these women join forces is  sure to keep you reading weU into the night.  The problem with having six characters  in a book this size is that once they do meet,  Cameron can no longer spend as much time  on each woman. During the book's second  half I was frustrated to see some characters  losing importance.  This is not to say that the second half  of the book is any less entertaining than  the first half By placing her characters in  the Klondike during the goldrush Cameron  could hardly bore her readers. And as the  women struggle to run their hotel, the novel  takes on a rather Utopian hue. The image of  six women forging their own way 'south of  an unnamed creek' is at once exhilarating  and inspiring.  EventuaUy the women lose their utopia.  Although her characters are strong, their  resUiency cannot obliterate aU of the difficulties that they encounter. Much of their  strength comes from the wisdom to know  when they should leave a situation.  The loss of the hotel is in keeping with  the cyclical motif that pervades Cameron's  novel. For these women, happiness is a tenuous emotional state.  When I began to read Anne Cameron's  novel South of an Unnamed Creek, I  found the resUiency of her characters dubious. I felt that Cameron, by faUing to allow her characters time to ruminate on their  misfortunes, was trivializing the impact  such experiences have on real women. Gradually I came to understand that Cameron  purposely leaves out the pain in order to focus on what these women can do despite  what has happened to them. All of the  women instinctively foUow the credo put  into words by one woman's grandmother:  "Always make sure you can pay your own  way... it's hfe and not easUy Uved." By the  end of the book these characters can both  pay their own way and Uve a Uttle easier.  KINESIS Arts  //////////////////////^^^^^  Shakespeare rewritten:  From fool to woman of vision  by Jeannie Lochrie  GOODNIGHT DESDEMONA  (Good morning JuUet)  by Ann-Marie MacDonald  directed by Banuta Rubess  Nightwood Theatre  I was apprehensive about going to Ann-  Marie MacDonald's play Goodnight Desdemona, (Good morning Juliet) not because it garnered a Chalmer's award and I  really wanted to hke it, but because of all  the bad press the male Vancouver critics  gave it.  Goodnight Desdemona is, in fact, brU-  Uant, not to mention gut-spUtting funny  aU wrapped up with fabulous acting, costumes, scenery and music. The premise of  the play is that modern-day Professor Constance LedbeUy has discovered the Gustave  Manuscript, Shakespeare's original source  for Romeo and Juliet and Othello which  the Bard transformed from comedies into  the tragedies we love/hate.  After being duped by a ruthless male academic she works for and loves, Constance  throws her research into the garbage only  to find herself transported into the twUight  zone of the ancients, the world of the "real"  Desdemona and the "real" Juhet, from the  tragic into the comedic.  MacDonald's play is about Shakespeare's  gals bonding, about Constance getting a  third eye view of her present passive  predicament (getting dumped and passed  over for a juicy academic posting) because  OtheUo (who's white, not Black in this version) and aU the other Shakespearean characters have karmic ties in the present.  For a feminist there was lots of food for  thought. The male critics just didn't get  it, though. And their poisoned pens were  mightier than the sword in this case because  the house just wasn't as full as it ought to  have been.  Constance as the wise fool is a fascinating feminist set-up. At first she repulsed me.  Constance, with her siUy red hat and Sun-  Desdemona (Diana Fajrajsl) and Constance Ledbelly (Kate Lynch) have a one-sided  pillow fight.  day school teacher's outfit and absentmind-  edness, is not the stuff of heroines. She is  a female type we so often see in theatre: a  milk toast.  Women... must be sick  and tired of playing  wimps and vamps...  In retrospect, MacDonald has employed  Brecht's distancing technique which stopped  me from identifying with Constance and  made me pay more attention to her than  I would have if she had been a towering  inferno of feminist rage. And MacDonald's  archetype of the woman academic who is  not in touch with reality is briUiant. Who  wants to relate to this brownie leader? She's  an archetype though, and this play is about  alchemy and cosmic truths.  Goodnight Desdemona is aU about Us-  tening to your dreams and whispers. And  Constance does Usten, so that by the end  of the play we witness and identify with  her alchemical transformation from passive  academic to "the Queen of Academe;" from  frustrated heterosexual to lesbian, from fool  into a woman of vision.  An interesting and consistent theme in  many of Shakespeare's plays is sexual confusion: men and women reversing roles. McDonald does much with this in Goodnight  Desdemona. Constance is mistaken for a  man—and JuUet gets a big thriU—and so  does Constance—when Juhet finds out why  she's bored with Romeo. We become witness to a rare scene: lesbian love-making onstage which suffers from coitus interruptus,  unfortunately. And there is a wonderful gay  dance scene, boys with boys and girls with  girls. And Desdemona and Juhet fight over  Constance's affections.  Put the taboo in a comedic context and  you can get away with murder. JuUet, looking Uke a punk rocker, tracks Constance  down and declares her love for her in a  parody of the lesbian erotic complete with  "erotic oysters and pale rose dew taste of  womanhood." The audience laughs but how  many have ever heard such wonderful poetry Uke this before?  Constance's tragic flaw—and they aU  have them in this story—is that she sees  herself as "just a school teacher" giving her  power away to her heartthrob, when in fact  the Fates teU her she has a "holy task" to  re-write history and publish the missing hnk  in Shakespeare.  Macdonald is doing what many women  artists are doing: she is entering into the  text and re-writing what could have been.  Plunging wholeheartedly into the subtext  and giving us characters to be reckoned  with. Presenting Women instead of the famihar victims that have become archetypes  lodged in the human unconscious and acted  out in the "real" world.  Much Uke Sally Potter's Thriller, a rewrite of Puccini's Mimi, MacDonald gives  us images of strong women, bonding and  falling in love and empowering one another.  A case in point is Desdemona, definitely  the star of this show. Not the wimpy victim  we know and hate, she is for MacDonald an  amazon warrior extraordinare who coaches  Constance to get in touch with rage and  passion. When they chant "Bullshit! BuUshit!" it's more powerful than any tragic so-  Uloquy could be.  Women of the theatre must be sick and  tired of playing wimps and vamps, angels  and whores. It is clear that MacDonald  knows her stuff. I can't wait to see what she  wUl do next. If you didn't see it, take heart,  the play has recently been published.  VINEGAR TOM  Caryl Churchill's Vinegar Tom is a non-traditional look at witchcraft that connects  the victims of the 17th century to the stereotyping of women today, illuminating  continuing issues such as prejudice, humiliation and violence against women.  Set in an English village in the middle of the 17th century, her play is a raw and  shocking illustration of a society that used poor, old, single or sexually unconventional  women as scapegoats by accusing them of witchcraft. Churchill intersperses the  historical material with contemporary songs that are occasionally crude and sexually  aggressive in order to examine the political themes in a modern context.  The Vancouver Little Theatre and Pink Ink's production of Vinegar Tom runs Tuesday through Saturday, through April 21st at the Vancouver Little Theatre, 3102  Main St. back door. Performances at 8:30 pm. Tickets are $10 with a group rate  of $7 per person for groups of 10 or more. For reservations call 876-4165.  KINESIS s^^vsssssssaass^ss^^  ARTS  /N^O>V\£*  by Melanie Conn  In a month when we could aU use a Uttle  pleasant distraction, science fiction comes to  the rescue!  SHADOW OF THE WARMASTER  by Jo Clayton  Daw paperback, 1988  As far as I'm concerned, Jo Clayton is the  queen of the swash-buckUng sf adventure.  Her books are irresistible, especiaUy when  I'm in the mood for an irreverent, down-to-  earth and just about invincible heroine. As  Shadow of the Warmaster begins, Ade-  laar aici Arash is in a state of wUd irritation:  her headstrong daughter, Asian, has gone  missing and it's clear that Adelaar wUl have  to find her, undoubtedly going to a great  deal of trouble in the process.  Asian, who is an academic and "basicaUy  rather duU", according to her mother, has  been off-world doing research—she's a kind  of anthropologist whose specialty is understanding ahen social systems. (Even before  the reader meets Asian, we suspect she may  be a little more interesting than her mother  thinks.)  In a lovely twist for Clayton fans, Adelaar is no outlaw hke some previous protagonists. Instead, she's a designer-installer of  security systems whose expertise is sought  throughout the galaxy. Her first step is to  barter her considerable skiUs in exchange  for an exotic team to help her in her rescue  mission. Her trade is with Swardheld Quale,  an elegant man whose castle needs protection and whose languid style (he knits to  relax) provides an amusing counterpoint to  Adelaar's impatience.  As the group sets out along a trail that's  already three years cold, their story alternates with Asian's. Captive on a planet over  which looms an enormous ship armed with  a nightmare weapon, she has many adventures of her own. Her biggest problem is to  resist malevolent propagandists who want  to use her knowledge to manipulate the pop  ulation. She also has a surprisingly undra-  matic reunion with her long-lost father.  Through it all, she does a lot of growing up and emerges as much more than her  mother's daughter.  VENUS OF SHADOWS  by Pamela Sargent  Bantam paperback, 1990  Now this was exciting to find in an airport bookstore: the latest Pam Sargent  novel, a long (643 pages) epic spanning four  generations and more than a century of  the Venus Project. The book is the second  in the series about transforming Venus to  make it habitable for human hfe. The first,  Venus of Dreams, is the story of visionaries dreaming of a new world and the technology required to make it a reahty. Venus of  Shadows describes the pohtical and social  obstacles confronted by the Venus settlers.  Sargent is stiU working on Child of  Venus, the final book In the series, the personal story of a woman who inherits the  dream finally come true.  Sargent is obviously engrossed in the series, explaining in the Afterward:  "The more I learned about Venus, the  greater  the obstacles became;  to ter-  raform that world would take ... centuries. The story I thought could be told  in one book soon burgeoned beyond that  length; the problems in telhng it, along  with the technical difficulties any planetary engineers would realistically face,  seemed insurmountable."  In fact,  she has succeeded very weU.  Shadows reads Uke a good historical novel,  gradually introducing characters and aUow-  ing them to interact against the larger backdrop of Venus' pohtical struggles to maintain its autonomy. One of the strongest  themes is the increasing power of "Ishtar," a  fundamentalist erotic cult. Demanding conformity and outlawing same sex relationships, Ishtar threatens the anarchist structure which has been so carefully cultivated  by the original settlers. The struggle is  '-' ^ -^«• /\> Cr Z- •r^r i  vividly played out between Risa, a leader in  the colony and her daughter, Chimene who  becomes the Ishtar Guide.  What surprised me about the book is  that, for the most part, Sargent's female  characters are unsympatheticaUy drawn.  What a disappointment from the author of  The Shore of Women a few years ago, to  say nothing of the Women of Wonder series. In this book the women are demanding, insensitive and generaUy unUkable, despite their dedication to their work. It's up  to the male characters to provide warmth  and understanding in relationships and as  leaders. Although the plot kept me going  right to the end, I kept wishing for a more  balanced (and realistic) picture of women.

She  knows what she hkes and she has done s  great job of selecting stories for this collection. Unhke many anthologies which have  a homogeneous feel to them, these stories  vary widely in tone, length and style.  There are several I would describe as surrealistic or dream-Uke, packing a gut-level  punch. "Womankind" by Rosaria Champagne is a sparse and eerie tale taking the  concept of "real" men and women to a  bizarre conclusion. Mary Ellen Matthews'  "ChUdren of Divers Kind" is the ultimate  clone story with an unmistakable flavour  of horror. Stories such as these surprised  Sturgis when she was preparing this anthology and convinced her to change her original terms of reference for the book because  they plumbed "the psychological or emotional depths of horrifying situations aU too  recognizable."  Other stories in the collection are of the  more straight forward variety which doesn't  mean they are predictable or less gripping.  Not at aU! "Signs of Life" by Barbara Kras-  noff is a wonderful piece which features  a down-and-out, drug-addicted space trav-  eUer whose expertise as an interpreter for  the Deaf provides her with an opportunity  to change her fate. The story also presents  the reader with a remarkable picture of the  power and beauty of signing in a topsyturvy world where the Deaf occupy positions of utmost importance for the whole  community.  But my favourite story was without a  doubt the funniest one.

LETTERS  Let's not forget the facts  Kinesis:  I am writing in reply to the letter from A  Space in your Feb. 1990 issue charging PEN  Canada with racism. Just to set the record  straight, their letter was obviously written  before June CaUwood publicly expressed  her regrets at telhng Vision 21 to "fuckoff".  Secondly, Vision 21 was invited to meet with  the Board or members of the Board but  turned down the invitation. Thirdly, Canadian PEN is re-evaluating its membership  criteria for published writers and anyone  can join as a "Friend of PEN." Yes there is  racism in our hves, in some more than others. Yes we must break down the barriers.  Yes we must open the windows. Yes we must  communicate.  And let's not forget the facts. The 54th  International PEN Congress in Toronto and  Montreal (which I attended) was a breath  of fresh air after the one that proceeded in  New York. For the 1st time over 50 percent of participants were women and it was  one of the most racially integrated Congresses ever. For me it was a very memorable and inspirational week. HopefuUy the  next Congress wUl continue to break down  waUs. But the work must be done from the  inside not from an angry distance.  For those who are interested in joining  PEN please write me c/o 4708-45th Ave.  Delta BC V4K 1J8. The BC membership  has been meeting informaUy for a year and  we are primarUy concerned with Writers-  in-prison. We have adopted two Buddhist  monk writers imprisoned in Vietnam. Thich  Tue Sy and Thich Tri Sieu. Their death sentences were recently commuted to 20 years  due to international outcry.  At the 54th PEN Congress the International Network of Women Writers was  formed. Write the Women's Committee of  PEN American Centre, 568 Broadway, New  York, NY 10012 for more information.  Sincerely,  Mona Fertig  Member of the Board of Directors,  PEN Canada  Ladner, BC  Why should we  pay to protest?  Kinesis:  It was good the International Women's  Day march and raUy happened (March 10).  It was weird that the organizers agreed to  fork over $800 for a permit. Given the government's horrendous slashes to women and  Native groups, and their attempt to re-  criminaUze abortion, why should we pay to  protest injustice? That money could have  been far better used.  Renee Rodin  Vancouver, B.C.
