GOT TO KEEP EM  IN  THEIR PLACE  but but © 73  analysis  Until the women's movement raised  the issue, wife-battering went unrecognized and unreported.  Beaten  women were forced into pretending  that theirs was a non-problem. In  this way, wife-battering has much  in common with rape. Both were  seen as personal rather than social problems until the women's  movement raised consciousness a-  bout them.  Both stem from the  system of male supremacy within  which women are pieces of property  to be used/abused by men.  But  there are two important differences  between rape and wife-battering.  One is that the wife-batterer is  supposed to be the very person to  whom the woman can turn for shelter  from the storm. The other, and  this is vital, is that in the case  of wife-battering (partner-battering might be a more accurate term),  the woman is economically dependent  upon the man.  Woman's position in the family as  an unwaged worker is one which society has trained her for and encouraged her to enter. Her skills,  those of home maintenance and child  rearing, are not skills which she  can easily sell, as society can  conveniently pretend that these are  non-skills.  Stemming from this e-  conomic dependence is a whole network of emotional and psychological  relationships between the woman who  is being beaten and the man who is  doing the beating.  Then there's  the kids. Even if the woman is  working, she's earning less than  the man 90% of the time.  Her income is keeping the family above  the poverty line. To ask a woman  to walk out of this overnight (as  in, "If a man ever struck me, that  would be jLt. .I'd be out that door  so fast...") is to ask her to a-  bandon not only her physical shelter and her arrangements for having  something to eat, but also the  whole social fabric she has been  trained to accept.  Betsy Warrior  writes:  "Women's economic dependence on  males must be abolished and  the family structure itself  must be changed. Sexism, like  racism...is a political philosophy of which wife beating is  but one expression. Only when  turn to p.3  action  Throughout the last decade, feminists  have been working upon public education to dispel myths surrounding wife-  battering. When TIME, in September of  '74, professed to enlighten us on the  subject of "Wife Beaters and Their  Wives" by telling us that the men  were 'mother's boys' and that the  beaten women were "aggressive, efficient, masculine and sexually frigid"  we didn't let them get away with it.  The women's movement has consistently opposed the ideology of the church  and of psychiatry which rationalizes  the oppression of women. ("Women  are like the masses in wanting to be  mastered and ruled." - Freud) Myths  surrounding female masochism have  been widely brought into doubt.  Along with public education, the  women's movement has demanded social,  economic and legal changes which  will make it easier for the battered  woman to escape her husband. For  an excellent account of these  demands, and of the current parlous  state of Canadian justice with  respect to battered women, read  Violence Begins at Home, which appeared in "The Canadian" (The Province's weekend supplement) on  November 2, '76. VSW member Arlene  Gropper and Joyce Marvin investigate  the alternatives for the battered  woman. Where can she go? The police  consider 'family disturbance'  calls trivial matters. In a recent  six month period in Vancouver, they  bothered to make written reports  on only 17% of such calls. And  locally, only a few cases ever do  reach the court. Gropper and Marvin  quote a JP's remark: "Most charges  by battered women are withdrawn at  a later date, and besides, these  are private matters between a man  and a woman."  Where can a woman go? An extensive  study of wife battering in the  Vancouver area in the fall of '76  indicated that well over half of  the women contacted Emergency  Shelters, Transition Houses, Crisis  Centres and the Vancouver Status  of Women. Almost a quarter of the  cases in this Vancouver study contacted Vancouver Transition House.  Of the 330 women contacting the  Transition House, 180 had to be  turned away due to lack of facilities, turn to p.3  what it's like  My name is Jamie. I'm an ex-battered  wife and I'm a feminist.  I didn't  have enough money to leave my husband  when he started beating up on me.  I was dependent upon him, period.  I've said it before and I'll be  saying it again: it all comes down  to dollars and cents. If I could have  left him then, I would have. I didn't  have many job skills. Typing: 30 wpm;  working in a store. Three kids under  four. I couldn't leave. When I hear  people say, "Why doesn't she leave  him?", well, I want to scream: she  can't, you dummy, because she's got  to eat!  I got married when I was 18 because  I was pregnant. I had my first two  children one year apart. The first  time he beat me up I had one four,  one three and one just a baby. I'd  found that I could either do the  housework, or look after the kids.  Not both. So I opted for looking after  the kids. My husband wanted a clean  house. I did, too. He'd just been  fired from his job, and the only  thing he could get was driving a  truck in the afternoons. That first  time I did tell somebody, although  later I learned to keep quiet about  it. My neighbour saw my bruises and  my black eye - he used to go for my  face, first - and asked me if I'd run  into a book.  I said, "No, my husband  beat up on me." She said: "Isn't  that funny!!", and laughed. She was  under society's pressure not to admit  that such things could happen, I guess.  Another time he beat me up, he got  me in the bathroom, and he flipped  me backwards into the bath.  I got  out of the bath and went into the  bedroom to get dressed. Next thing  I knew he was grabbing me by my feet  and dragging me out the front door.  No way I was going to be locked out  of my own home, so I got round the  back and crawled through the basement window. He was sending the kids  around to lock all the doors and  windows.  The fifth time he did it, I called  the cops. They took their time  arriving - I could have been dead  by the time they showed up. My husband turned to pudding when they  finally came, however.

Your article was reprinted from a  gay liberation journal, The Body  Politic, in which we were badly misquoted.  Our actual statement, ready by  Gloria Geller, was, however:  "We, the B.C. Federation of Women,  Rights of Lesbian Subcommittee,  believe lesbian oppression and  women's oppression to be more  aligned than lesbian oppression  and gay male oppression. As  lesbians we are equally oppressed  as women. We feel that the oppression of lesbians is the ultimate extension of women's oppression. Lesbians are oppressed  less for relating to women than  for refusing to relate to men in  the approved female roles. The  struggle for lesbian rights cannot be separated from the struggle for women's rights.  The gay  fight for equal status with heterosexuals does nothing to change  our patriarchal society where  men have power over women. Until  women have equality with men, the  fight for equality with heterosexuals merely gives gay men equal  status with heterosexual men and  reinforces the oppression of  women. Our fight is not only  for the right to relate to someone of the same sex."  It seems peculiar that you would  choose to reprint an article from a  'Gay Liberation' journal, when feminist papers, like Toronto's The  Other Woman, carry such accurate  reports of these conferences. (You  do not need to go so far for information. The Rights of Lesbians  Subcommittee meets in Vancouver  regularly, usually right in your  basement!)  We appreciate the coverage of Lesbian  events and issues in Kinesis; this is  an important step in building a  strong, united women's movement. We  would be pleased to send reports  directly to your paper, knowing now,  that information we send is used.  Please, please though, approach us  on matters concerning statements  allegedly made by the Rights of Lesbians Subcommittee.  (We are busy  enough taking responsibility for  statements we actually do make, let  alone misinterpretations!)  Thank you.  Sincerely,  Yvette Perreault for  The Rights of Lesbians  Subcommittee of the B.C.  Federation of Women  With reference to the unsigned article entitled VIGIL AT THE PEN on  page 14 of your January 1977 issue,  Vol. 1, #2, it is noted in a box  statement that this purports to be  "Facts from the Prisoners* Rights  Group.

Please be advised that this article  did not emanate from the Press and  Publicity Committee of the Prisoners' Rights Group, the only authorized source for such a release.  In view of the nature of the article which contains several errors,  omissions and distortions,.as well  as the unwarranted inclusion of my  telephone number, it would be  appreciated if this correction be  published in the next issue of  KINESIS.  Thank yop for your cooperation.  Yours sincerely,  Claire Culhane  for PRISONERS' RIGHTS  GROUP  Editor, Kinesis.  Dear Sister (if I may so address you):  Dulce Oikawa's article, "Women and  Religion", gives a wrong impression  of the Anglican conception or recognition of sacraments. As an Anglican  I should point out that the article  confuses Roman Catholic and Anglican  beliefs when it asserts, "Other sacraments in the Church include baptism,  confirmation, marriage, holy orders  (ordination), penance (forgiveness),  and death".  (I don't think death is  regarded as a sacrament in either  Church, but we*11 let this pass!)  The 25th Article of Religion of the  Anglican Church says, in part: "There  are two Sacraments ordained of Christ  our Lord in the Gospel, that is to  say, Baptism, and the Supper of the  Lord.  "Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,  Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted  for Sacraments of the Gospel, being  such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the  Scriptures; but yet have not the nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and  the Lord's Supper, for that they have  not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God."  Theology is not a speciality of mine,  but I can at least quote Article XXV!  Sincerely yours,  Geoffrey B.Riddlehough onolysisfcont)  from col 1, p.l  This political crime is not simply a  matter of male-female sexual politics  but reflects the domination of our  society by those who exploit the  many for the profit of the few. As  long as our social decisions are being made on the basis of what is  profitable rather than what is humane, the wife-beater has a whole  arsenal behind him.  As a feminist  lawyer puts it, "A judge isn't going  to put a guy who makes a living in  jail and his wife on welfare.  In  terms of the respective values of  our society, his earning money outweighs her possible injury."  The growing movement which demands an  end to wife-battering also recognizes  that the violence expressed by the  man upon the woman is an expression  of a violent society. He's taking  out his anger upon her which is produced within him by having to compete  for his job, by being pressured by  his boss, by lay-offs, speed-ups, etc,  Instead of fighting back against this  exploitation, he finds it easier to  release his frustration by kicking  his wife around. It's, one step up  from kicking the cat. The battered wife is thus a casuality at the  end of a long line of abuse and  alienation which is integral to  our capitalist system.  Transition Houses are a necessary  step in combatting this brutality:  women must have a safe place away  from their attackers. But finally  it's a temporary Band-Aid solution,  as are more sensitive responses  from the legal system. What we  are really opposing is the violence  of a whole society.  action  cont. from col 2, p.l  Clearly, battered women realise that  their greatest chance of support  will come from other women. The  establishment of Transition Houses,  and their staffing by feminists  is a priority of the women's movement. Throughout B.C., the struggle  for funding for these Houses is  an acute one. We now have Transition Houses in Victoria, Vancouver,  Langley, Kamloops and Prince George.  None of these has funding which  is adequate to meet the needs of  battered women. In Maple Ridge,  (from col 2, this page.)  Chez Nous, a transition house, had  to close its doors when its LIP  funding ran out. Ishtar transition  house, now in Aldergrove, was forced  to close its doors for several months  in '76, but has been able to reopen.  Port Coquitlam women are currently  battling with Human (sic) Resources  Minister, Vander Zalm, for a transition house in their area. VSW URGES  READERS TO WRITE TO VANDER ZALM  IN SUPPORT OF THE REQUEST BY THE  PORT COQUITLAM WOMEN'S CENTRE FOR  A TRANSITION HOUSE IN THEIR AREA.  In New York City, a class action  suit is under way against the New  York Police and the Family Court.  It is being filed by one of 12  married women who were seriously  beaten by their husbands and then  refused assistance by the police  and the family court. This the  first time, ever, that such legal  action has been taken by women.  The National Congress of Neighborhood women and other women's groups  who were active in organising the  suit are also demanding funds to  provide shelters for battered  wives. They insist that these shelters must be controlled by women's  groups, not by the state. This class  action suit follows on the heels of  a large speak-out in NYC by battered wives: most of whom were poor  and working class, nearly half of  whom were Black.  In Vancouver, a research group sponsored by the United Way has just  completed an extensive study of  Wife Battering. Included in their  Recommendations are the establishment of Transition Houses. We  must ensure that such new Houses are  staffed and controlled by feminists.  jemie's Story  (continued from col.3, p.l)  a whole week to actually make up my  mind to press charges, but I did  it. Then the lawyer got me to see  a marriage counsellor. My husband  kept telling me that if I went ahead  with the charges I would give him  a criminal record and jeopardise  his job, and his job opportunities.  The counsellor went along with  that argument. I was swayed by  that, because my own future depended on his job. And the kids'  future did, too. So I dropped the  charges. I really regret that now.  Another thing was that my 12 year  old daughter would have had to go  to court as a witness and it would  have been really ugly for her.  I joined the Women's Liberation  Alliance in Vancouver in 1971.  My husband felt that I was really  threatening his authority. He was  'very liberal' about it when I  told him that I had become involved  in the women's movement. But underneath he was afraid. And still is.  He feels very strongly that he  has lost his authority, and that  I have pressured him to change.  And in 1971 none of the other men  at work had wives who were into  women's liberation.  I felt really stuck with raising the  kids, and until I joined the women's  movement I had absolutely nowhere  to go for help. Being at home with  them all day was really hard. I  had a few Christmas jobs - one  year I worked in pyjamas. I got home  at 6.45 and had to start picking up  after the kids; it was really exhaust'  ing. Then I worked at the Bay in  china and I nearly went round the  bend.  Finally I got a job as a  coordinator of a gift shop and it  was a bit better. But the kids were  still all my responsibility. When I  did turn to my husband for help  with them, he would say that I was  being "too goddam lenient" and wade  in with hobnail boots to show me  the 'right' way to raise kids. He  was beaten as a child himself. He  says that he deserved it. He really  believes that.  Being in the women's movement was  the first time I felt I had any  support behind me, and that my  ideas were being given any credence.  I felt more confident, and I learned  better how to stand up for myself  in an argument. One of the things  I did shortly after joining the  movement was to go on strike at home.  I didn't do any housework for four  months. After that time (and there  were fights along the way) my  husband said that if I started  doing housework again, he would  give me an allowance.  Because he is_ making good money  now, and has ample job security  (he works for a crown corporation),  I have been able to leave and get  a 'good' separation allowance so  that the kids and I can get by.  The very last time he started hitting me, I jumped on him and started  fighting back with all my might. He  was really surprised (drunk, too,  which is usual when he's attacking  me) and I was able to really let  him have it.  I think he'll never  try to beat me again. I have no  special fighting skills. I just laid  into him, punching and kicking and  pulling his hair.  Now that we're formally separated,  I still see him sometimes. You  don't just take a large chunk of  your life and throw it away, no  matter how bad it was. Just before  I left him, he was being a little  less of a John Wayne. Maybe more  Henry Fonda.  But now he's hard at  work embracing the male stereotype:  39, with a good job at last.  Into sailing in competitions.  Making a suave come-on to younger  women. His last desperate attempt  to prove that he's a real hero.  If anyone is in the situation that I  was in, I would advise you to leave,  if you are at all able to, in any  way. Do it. Don't stick around. It  took me eighteen years to make the  move and twelve of those years were  most unhappy. After spending that  long a time in that kind of repressive atmosphere, I became more and  more unsure of myself. Often I  felt ashamed for staying, and very  guilty. Any self-esteem I ever had  had shrivelled down to next to  nothing. CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT:  a feminist critique  The Canadian Human Rights Act  (C-52) is a Federal Act which is  being read in the House this session. It has already passed First  Reading and is approaching Second  Reading. Now is the time for feminists to respond to the Act and to  have our voices heard, before it's  too late.  We recognize that the effectiveness  of the human rights legislation  depends on three elements being  fully met:  adequate legislation,  suitable appointments as Commissioners and funding and commitment from  the government for Commission to  implement legislation.  The Canadian Human Rights Act should  begin with an adequate preamble  affirming the unalienable rights  of citizens to participate fully in  society.  We feel that it is important for this legislation to promote rights and not merely oppose  discrimination.  The difference between recognizing rights and freedoms and providing economic and  social conditions to exercise them  must be acknowledged.  The legislation should be broad, positive  and aimed at enhancing the dignity  of all human beings as well as improving their quality of life.  It  must have supremacy over all other  federal legislation,.  The legislation must state positively and clearly that discrimination  can occur only if reasonable grounds  exist.  Any definitions, exceptions  or elaborations should enhance this  concept.  It should encourage and  facilitate the individual's access  to remedy as a matter of right and  provide a unified clear and free  avenue of recourse for victims of  discrimination.  The legislation must give the Commission independence, making it  responsible to parliament similar  to the bilingualism legislation.  The Commission should have wide  powers to promote human rights  through education and. affirmative  action programmes to investigate  and mediate actions.  It should be  able to appear before tribunals  and other parliamentary committees  in the role of amicus curiae.  It  should also make itself available  to persons and groups wishing to  make presentations.  It must have  the power to review existing legislation, regulations and practice  and advise the government, and  make recommendations for changes  in laws, etc. which contradict the  legislation.  Finally, while recognizing that education and mediation  should be the first objectives of  the Commission, the Commission must  have the machinery to enforce orders  and the discretion to make awards  in those cases where individuals  have suffered financial loss or  humiliation.  The effectiveness of the Act will  depend on the quality and integrity  and commitment of the persons appointed as Commissioners.  The HRC  should be appointed by Parliament  to whom it should also be responsible. Members of the Commission  should not necessarily be lawyers  and should realistically represent  the male/female ratio in Canada.  Lastly, it is obvious that the Commission will need adequate funds and  human resources to enable it to be  effective in the battle against discrimination.  The Federal Government has had ten  years to listen to concerned groups  and to study various provincial human rights branches in action. There  was even a trial run in 1975 when  Bill C-72 was introduced.  The Justice Minister's Christmas gift for  '76 was in a few instances a slight  improvement to the previous bill,  but not the far-reaching legislation  we had hoped for.  At best it is a  cautious step to halt outrageously  discriminating practices on the most  narrow grounds. Every effort seems  to have been made to protect the  Crown and its agencies from having  to scrutinize their own attitudes  and practices of discrimination.  SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  REGARDING BILL C-25  1.  The preamble should include a  positive affirmation of the rights  of all individuals to be allowed  to develop their pergonal abilities and to be judged by those  abilities.  Reference should be  made to the Bill of Rights and  the United Nations Declaration  of Human Rights.  2. There must be a primacy clause  to ensure that the Human Rights  legislation has supremacy over  other existing legislation.  3. There is no clause stating that  discrimination can only occur  because of reasonable cause.  The categories listed in the  Act (race, national or ethnic  origin, colour, religion, age,  sex or marital status, or conviction for an offence for  which a pardon has been granted  or by discriminatory employment  practices based on physical  handicap) is much too limited.  In addition to a reasonable  cause clause, political affiliation, life style, sexual orientation, economic or social  standing, previous criminal  conviction, mental or emotional  handicap, should be included  unless such characteristics  are shown to be directly related to the capacity to perform the assigned work.  4. Denial of services, facility  or accommodation should be based  on reasonable cause.  5. Sections 11(3) (4) and 14(a)  should be removed.  11 limit and  /or restrict the present definitions and could be interpreted  to ensure that women are contained in job ghettos.  6. The several sections excluding  CPP, all pension, insurance and  annuity plans could be adequately  dealt with under sections 32(7),  64, and 65. Under section 32(7)  no one may lose benefits already  provided.  The Commission can  decide when to take action,  thereby giving time to establish  new regulations and legislation,  which are in agreement with Human Rights legislation.  7. The Indian Act has been specifically exempted from this Act.  VSW, while recognizing the need  for this, believes that allowing  the blatant sex discrimination  found in this Act to remain,  makes a mockery of the government's stated intention of curbing discrimination.  8. The Cabinet retains too much control (regulations regarding procedures for investigation, consent needed to prosecute under  the Act, Treasury Board approval,  no budget, can appoint Labour  officers and assign to them  Human Rights duties).  Commission should be able to make  regulations subject to approval  of Parliament. There should be  no statutory limit to the number  of regional offices.  Two good things:  1. Section 11 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer  to establish and maintain differences in wages between male and  female.employees employed in the  same establishment who are performing work of equal value.  2. Section 22 gives the federal  Commission the power to review  any regulations etc. of the  federal government and to make  recommendations regarding them,  and to enter into agreements with  the provincial human rights to  perform each other's functions  and duties and work together on  projects, etc.  This critique was prepared at VSW  by ombudsperson Carol Pfeiffer, in  cooperation with Johanna den Hertog,  Sheila Jones and Shelley Lea. UIC  HASSLCS  SORWUC (Service, Office and Retail  Workers of Canada) are currently  fighting a UIC decision which has  denied benefits to a woman on the  basis that she was not employed  during the requisite 10 week period  around the date of conception.  This is a discriminatory clause  and should, therefore, be eradicated.  In addition, both AUCE and SORWUC  have encountered problems with the  existing UIC Act in trying to get  union clauses that deal with  maternity and pay leave implemented. At AUCE, they have a clause  which provides that the employer  will pay women the difference  between her Maternity Pay on UIC  and what she would normally have  received in salary had she been  working during her maternity leave  period, if she afterwards returns  to work for at least six months.  Find out more about this situation from SORWUC at 681-2811.  Last month, in reporting upon  comments upon women's issues in  the Federal House of Commons,  Kinesis raised the issue of the  eligibility of women for UIC  benefits upon the premature  birth of a baby. The Hon. Bud  Cullen, Federal Minister of  Manpower and Immigration,  responds:  "On February 1, 1976, the legislation governing the payment  structure of maternity benefits  was changed. Under the changes,  a woman may be entitled to receive  the maximum of 15 consecutive  weeks of maternity benefits  beginning as early as 8 weeks  before the expected week of birth  and ending as late as 17 weeks  after the week in which her baby  was born.  Any woman who has a premature  baby can apply for maternity  benefits as soon as her baby is  born and may be eligible to  receive the maximum of 15 weeks  of benefits. Of course, she must  still meet the basic qualifying  conditions. She must have at least  20 weeks of insurable employment  in the 52 weeks before applying  or since the start of her last  claim, whichever is the shortest  period. She must also have at  least 10 weeks during which she  worked in insurable employment  or received benefits between the  30th and 50th week before the  week in which her baby is born.  As the economy deteriorates, the  government is moving to whittle  down the UIC ACT so that fewer  unemployed workers qualify for  benefits. Last December 9, Bud  Cullen tabled a motion to amend  the Act.  The eligibility for  benefits was extended from a  minimum of eight weeks to twelve  weeks.  50,000 jobless were deprived of benefits.  This discrimination extends in a  sexist manner to women. Whereas  ordinary workers must now work  12 weeks for a minor claim, the  pregnant woman must have worked  for 20 weeks.  And she must be  working while she becomes pregnant!  The Vancouver Status of Women  gives its fullest support to  groups such as AUCE and SORWUC  who are organising to challenge  this Act, which oppresses women  workers with elegant, bureaucratic  sexism.  AN €XTPA MUSICAL P£VI€W  Sandra heindsmann  January 23rd, the Vancouver New  Music Society presented a concert  on the occasion of Barbara Pent-  land's sixty-fifth birthday.  Extra-musically it was as interesting and rewarding an evening  as it was for the ear. My particular pleasure was at the visible contribution local women had  made to the evening. Firstly,  Ms. Pentland is an inspiring Vancouver artist, whose work Disasters  of the Sun was commissioned especially by the New Music Society.  Much New Music is difficult to  listen to, although usually Intellectually interesting. Both  Interplay, a chamber piece for  accordian and strings, and Disasters were beautiful and pleasurable.  I was impressed moreover at the,  may I say dignity, maintained by  the accordian despite my expectations.  There are no gimmicks in  Pentland's work, and the accordian  was used in the best tradition of  New Music, which approaches sound  as if it were newly discovered,  showing us what is possible to hear.  Disasters, the major piece of the  evening was interesting too, in  that Ms. Pentland had been inspired  by her friend Dorothy Livesay's  poem series of the same title.  Both women have not only maintained  their artistic vision as women into  maturity, but show development  which dignifies us all in its dis  avowal, by example, of our major  obsolescence myths. When Livesay  writes to the sun "I have lived  sixty-five years/under your fiery  blades" and "My hands that used to  be leaves...have become roots  gnarled in soil" in a sequence  which includes "no more lovely man  can be/than he with moon-wand/who  witches water" our ideas on aging  and the sexual lifetime are expanded.  This necessity to reevaluate in the midst of pleasure  is a true gift of art.  Phyllis Mailing, soloist, has been  commended many times as an exceptionally fine interpreter of New  Music.  I would like to thank her  moreover for the clarity with which  the poetry was expressed.  Both  Pentland as composer and Mailing  as performer let music and word  enhance each other, without the  operatic distortion one too often  encounters.  Besides these three  outstanding women artists, two  other aspects of the evening added *  to my sense of sexual pride.  In  Tom Takemitsu's piece Bryce, flautist Kathy Cernauskas conducted  while playing, in an unostentatious  manner of competency which also  says much for this consistently  satisfying series of concerts by  the Society.  The sense of sharing  this living music among creators,  performers and appreciators is  well housed by the Vancouver East  Cultural Centre's intimate setting,  visually and accoustically.  The  fourth piece, a fine quartet for  strings, was by Ruth Seeger, yes,  Pete and Mike's mother. The program notes that she "brought an  adventurous mind to composition  despite her rather small output".  One cap understand this, as she  raised her talented family at the  same time that she both "developed  teaching methods for children  utilizing folk music" and "transcribed, edited and arranged several thousand American folk songs"  in collaboration with the Library  of Congress.  Some day we will not  have to highlight the contribution  of women artists, nor even to note  their integration in the world of  their fellow workers. Meantime,  an evening of excellent music by  two women composers, a poet and a  performer-conductor does much to  raise the spirits and contrast the  old picture of men in tuxedos fiddling away to each other while we  peak around our elaborate hair  sculptures to watch.  The collaboration of these artists  and the Society and the four men  (in quiet grey suits) who played  Pentland's and Seeger's pieces -  the Purcell String Quartet - and  the men and women (in black and  white street clothes) who played  with them in other pieces (one  percussionist dipping bells and  chimes into a dish of water) gave  us a far different picture for eye  and ear.  I thank them. U.S.  HOUSEWORK STILL DOESN'T PAY  A nationwide drive opened in November to enforce the extension of  federal minimum wage laws to 1.5  million maids, cooks and other  domestic workers.  The campaign  is coordinated by the National  Committee on Household Employment  which wOn federal minimum wage  coverage of $2.20 an hour for  household workers in 1974, after  a 10-year struggle.  Since then,  enforcement of that law has been  almost non-existent.  Household workers have a median  yearly income of only $2,700 per  year.  97 percent of them are  women, 54 percent are Black and  the median age is 50.  Abortion in Europe  -Italy's lower house of parliament  has passed a new abortion law which  replaces a Mussolini-era ban on  abortions as a crime against the  purity of the Italian race.  This measure, which was passed  by a coalition ranging from C.P  to conservative Liberal, was  opposed by the governing  Christian Democrats and by  the Roman Catholic Church.  The new law would permit  abortions to avoid "ser  -ious danger to the physical or mental health of  the woman in relation to  her state of health, to  her economic, social or  family conditions or to  circumstances in which she \  conceived, or in anticipation of abnormalities or malformations in the baby to be\  born."  A woman wanting an abortion  would have to consult a doctor,\  but could make her own decision  after a week of reflection.  HOLLAND ABORTION CRACK-DOWN  For the second time in two years an  attempt has been made to close down  the Bloemebhove Abortion Clinic, the  only one in the Nederlands which  will terminate pregnancies over 12  weeks.  Over a thousand people, mostly women,  protested at the closure, breaking  into wards locked by bailiffs. At  present, abortion clinics are technically illegal, though they are  tolerated by authorities while abortion law reform is being debated.  ABORTION ILLEGAL IN PORTUGAL  Women lawyers working through the  Democratic Women's Rights Movement  in Portugal have completed their  list of feminist demands. Although  the new Portuguese constitution  guarantees equal pay and insists  that working women should be paid  their full salary before and after  childbirth, the guarantees have only  recently gone into effect.  The constitution does not mention  abortion, and therefore, under the  law of the previous regime, abortion  is still illegal. Hundreds of the  more than 150,000 abortions performed in Portugal each year are fatal  due to unsafe conditions.  SOUTH KOREA  The women's movement in Japan has  begun to campaign against kisaeng  tourism in South Korea. The  kisaeng  (Korean style geisha) is  licensed by the South Korean  government to 'entertain her  guest in his bedroom' and 'kisaeng  girls' are hired by the tourist  hotels in Seoul to cater to their  guests, predominantly male delegations of business people coming  from Japan. As well, young South  Korean women are exported to fill  the same functions in the Japanese hotels, with the connivance  of the South Korean government  which stamps their passports  "Artistic Delegation".  The industrial structure of South  Korea has changed greatly  within the last decade. Between  1962 and 1969, for example, there  was a 10% shift from agriculture  to manufacturing. As in many  CHILE  i\  wor  'developing' countries, this  neglect of agriculture has created  rural poverty, mass migration to  the cities and the growth of urban  slums. Private investors put their  money into textiles and clothing,  electronics, cars and pharmacet-  ucials, banking, insurance and  tourism in preference to education,  health care or agriculture. Thus,  the people fleeing from the poverty of the countryside provide  cheap urban labour pools for the  new industries. For the women, who  are employed by the thousands of  small and middle-sized factories,  a working day is 10 - 12 hours  with one short break, often extended to 18 hours. The pay for this  is about $12 a month. Ten hours  as a whore, however, brings the  woman twice as much as she earns  in her 10-18 hour factory day.  Under this free enterprise system,  she is free to choose between  two modes of expl- .tation.  (Facts from SPARE . :B, 9 Newburgh  St, London.

The detailed report was prepared  by the Advisory Council on the Status of Women for discussion by its  30 members from across the country  at their first quarterly meeting  of the year today and Wednesday.  The wage gap between men and women  public servants widened, the concentration of women in administrative support jobs increased and only  three more women were promoted to  executive positions, the report  said.  "It is evident.that government policy directives made at that time  have not been effective," the council concluded in the report.  "It is apparent that the government  will have to be even more aggressive  if it is really serious about improving the status and opportunities  of its women employees.  Although the number of women in the  public service increased to 89,129  or 32.6 per cent of the total employees in 1975, from 81,911 or  31.7 per cent in 1974, their employment in top jobs barely changed,  the report said.  few illusions  On January 18th, the quarterly  membership meeting of VSW was held  at the YWCA. The meeting began with  a discussion of the current status  of women i.e. poverty. Afterwards,  the discussion moved into a workshop  with members exchanging their ideas  and feelings about the state of the  movement at the moment. It was a  very fruitful evening, and the  discussion was open and honest.  Joyce Legaux and Sandra Currie, both  of the VRB, introduced an excellent  discussion of the deteriorating state  of the Canadian economy. As both  pointed out, women today have fewer  illusions about what we have achieved  with the maginal reforms of the last  decade. Legaux summarised statistics  indicating that women are losing  ground steadily. Single female heads  of families are increasingly to be  found within low income groups.  Sandra Currie pointed to the fact  that as soon as low income women do  manage to make a small amount of  money, it's all taken away in childcare.  It was the feeling of the  membership that heavy-duty economic battles are on the agenda for  women in the lean years ahead.  detroit could  care less  MOM'S REPAIRS IS NO MORE. However,  the WOMEN'S AUTOMOTIVE RESOURCE  CENTRE, a  LIP project which provides  nake-work employment for two of the  collective's members will continue  until the end of May.  Mom's Repairs is NOT closing down  because they're broke. "We have a  terrible attraction for government  money", explains a collective  member, "and probably we could go  on receiving it for years, slaving  away for poverty-line wages if we  wanted to". The notion of 'women  mechanics' has become acceptable to  funding agencies and even has a  somewhat trendy image with the  media. The women at Mom's provided  an example of this: a local t.v.  station phoned up and wanted somebody to come down and repair a  pink Fiat. They stipulated that the  woman must be wearing overalls.  The women spoke about what they  had gained from the collective.  "To learn how to repair cars was to  take power back for ourselves in  an area where it has been kept from  us. This power is real; it breaks  the mold, and small changes are  accomplished in our cognitive  system. It's a learning process  about how changes happen. It's a  poltical process. When I go down  to the lumber yard and I know  exactly what I want, the man I'm  dealing with stares at me like he's  just met a talking dog. Something  is happening in his head. It's change,  "When we started our work repairing  cars, that was how it felt. But our  work turned into providing a service,  and it was no longer a sharing of  political change with other women.  It's simply impossible to share this  taking back of power with other  women when you have learned all you  have to learn. You find yourself  playing the role of woman mechanic.  "Then there is the question of what  is really changed in the system when  the oil is changed. What if every  single woman in B.C. knew how to do  her own tune-ups? This process does  not necessarily challenge the system.  Detroit could care less. You can  compare our work with that of food-  coops. It's beneficial for the people  who are connected with it, but the  corporations like Safeway and Ford  can carry on regardless. In a way,  it's a con job, offering women  power over something (their old  Volvo, e.g.) that Detroit will  have made obsolete within five  years."  Mom's Repairs Collective has been an  extremely positive experience for  all of the women involved. They will  now continue in the movement working  for political change in other areas.  The WORKSHOPS organized by the  WOMEN'S AUTOMOTIVE RESOURCE CENTRE  WILL CONTINUE. For info phone Ina,  874-2564.  provincial  victories  CHANGE OF NAME  B.C. Health Minister Bob McLelland  announced recently that legislation  allowing married women to keep their  maiden names will soon be introduced  into the provincial legislature.  The law if passed would also allow  divorced women to revert to their  maiden names without going through  the complicated legal procedures now  required.  In addition, the bill, entitled Change  of Name Amendment Act 1977, would  allow a husband or wife to take each  other's last name after marriage.  Both spouses would have to consent  to name changes.  There is no statutory requirement  today for married women to take their  husband's surnames. It is only a  matter of custom.  However, many financial institutions  like banks won't recognize a woman  who doesn't use her husband's family  name.  Finally, the proposal would protect  children's rights as they may be  affected by name changes.  Feminists in B.C. have been pushing  for such legislation for many years  since B.C. is one of the few Canadian  provinces without it.  Rosemary Brown,  NDP MLA introduced a private members  bill on the subject last session.  56 bills were passed in the B.C. legislature last session. Although some  benefited women, none were specifically aimed at women's rights. This  will be the first piece of legislation  the new Social Credit government has  introduced for women.  It's ironic that we had to wait for  this reform to be enacted by a Party  which does not even profess to have  policy on women's issues.  RUMORS AND MORE RUMORS  A little victory in the human rights  field provincially.  VSW has learned, from usually reliable  sources, that three Boards of Inquiry  have been approved since the small  flurry of letters and complaints  landed on the Hon. Minister Alan  Williams' desk.  Some people actually  got replies from the Minister himself  but the Minister directed Ms. Ruff to  reply to our request for action.  More on the provincial scene in the  next issue.  Watch for amendments and new legislation on Matrimonial Property in this  session. Our understanding is that  the government is not prepared to  implement the Berger recommendations  so we may have to start fighting that  one all over again.  (Copies of the  Berger material are on file at VSW.) SpeaKjng  the oppressors'  language  janet  Summerton  This is the oppressor's language,  But I need it to talk to you.  - Adrienne Rich  It is with considerable trepidation  that I attempt to discuss sex differences in language from my position  as a woman, when my vehicle of communication is a language created by  men.  The language, because it reflects the male world view, is far  from adequate to express the vision  of awareness and consciousness many  of us are experiencing.  Indeed this  new perception is constantly slipping  away from us because this straight-  jacket of language does not allow us  to verbalize and thus objectify and  share it.  Few serious attempts have yet been  made to deal with the issue of sex  and language.  Scholars in linguistics and anthropology have observed  and written of sex differences in  exotic languages since the beginning  of the century.  The differences in  English have been alluded to by scholars and writers throughout this century but have only recently been  studied seriously.  Surprisingly,  myths regarding our version of language have crept into the literature  and have been transformed into facts  supported with negligible amounts of  concrete evidence. As a result of a  handful of research reports, a few  articles and three books published in  1975, the lines are being drawn, the  areas of concern mapped out.  I am  concerned with how the language treats  us, how we use English and our styles  of verbal and non-verbal interaction.  Mary Ritchie Key points out the importance of considering Malinowski's  concept of context of situation.  "Every human being participates in  many varieties of behavior, depending  upon the relationships of the participants, the situation where interaction  takes place, and the whole range of  conditions involved...many of the  differences which are attributed to  male and female behavior are mixed  in complex ways with other dimensions  of behavior." My comments refer to  general tendencies rather than hard  and fast, exclusive rules of communicative behavior.  HOW LANGUAGE  TREATS US  Let's first consider the use of male  terms as generic, rather than gender  specific - that is using man, or mankind to mean all human beings.  This  usage has been challenged for long  enough that some headway is being made  towards the use of terms which include  women.  But consider the widespread  common use of manpower, one man show,  manmade, brotherhood and forefathers.  The masculine pronoun used for the  hypothetical person or unknown person  is fading out and being replaced with  the pronoun they.  Increasingly, the  forms he/she or s/he are being used  in written language.  However, we are  still confronted with modifiers such  as lady doctor or woman pilot and  feminine endings such as heroine or  poetess, and attempts to change the  order of male referents as first are  often met with derision.  So we still  have man and woman, his and hers, male  and female, brother and sister.  These  habitual language patterns help to reinforce the concept of us as invisible,  as outsiders.  So deep in the psyche  are these traditions, that as I write  I am tempted to speak of woman as the  other.  We are conditioned to the masculine use of we and us - we have  been trained to interpret the world  through their eyes.  Pairs of words which originally were  symmetrical now have widely divergent  meanings.  Consider for yourself if  the contemporary meanings show equality or degradation.  Think of mistress and master, matron and patron,  spinster and bachelor, governess and  governor.  When will we be able to eliminate the  use of girls for females of any age?  Why do we still accept the expression  'his bride', or the gross inequity of  'man and wife'?  How can we discourage  the use of animal terms to describe  us? Why do only women fret, scream,  shriek, become hysterical, be vivacious or pushy?  If we use or listen  to phrases like 'old wives tales',  'venus fly trap', 'black Maria',  'weak sister' and 'seminal thinkers',  or men's disparaging comments of  other men such as 'he's effeminate'  or 'he's an old woman', what must be  the extent of our psychic damage?  If we also consider the barrage of  sexual terms it is easy to conclude  we women are objects, spoken of in  terms of our relation to men, not as  equal members of the human race.  We  should react strongly to charges of  being manly or unfeminine now we are  beginning to articulate our genuine  experiences.  Some researchers have investigated  dictionaries for evidence of male  domination.  Varda One found that  more space is given to male items,  sex role stereotypes are reinforced,  drawings are mostly of men and male  animals and more insulting terms for  women are included.  Although some writers question the  importance of this information it  seems imperative to me to correct  this sexism in language wherever possible.  Jespersen says "If we turn  to the actuating principles that determine the general changeability of  human speech habits, we shall find  that the moving power everywhere is  an impetus starting from the individual and that there is a curbing  power in the mere fact that language  exists, not for the individual alone  but for the whole community." As  members of fifty one per cent of the  population we could initiate and sustain change in these habits.  OUR USEOF  LANGUAGE  There has been a trend, especially  with early researchers, to consider  our language as peculiar, deviant -  an aberration.  This I hope to avoid  and to show instead that the language we are taught is a way of keeping us apart, out of the mainstream  of social affairs.  Snide remarks  about the triviality of our talk  abound in male literature.  I would  suggest our talk is rendered such to  help keep us in our place.  Consider  most of these issues as generalizations in regard to our interactions  with men, for our communication  patterns in that sphere are vitally  important to our position.  We women tend to substitute requests  for commands or assertive statements:  Would you please?  Do you mind?  We also avoid being assertive by inserting hedges:  perhaps, I guess, sort of  kind of, maybe  And tag questions:  isn't it?  do you think so?  Lakoff and Key claim we tend to use  intensifiers (so, such, quite, very)  which end up distracting, thereby  weakening, plain forceful speech.  Jespersen claimed women are fond of  hyperbole and use more adverbs such  as awfully, terribly, absolutely and  frightfully.  Really?  SP€€CH &  STATUS  These patterns of speech are part of  the fabric of our social beings and  indicate hesitancy and submission. To  drop these patterns leaves us open to  charges of behaving like a man, of  being unfeminine. Yet with these  patterns certain spheres of activity  are closed to us.  It is, indeed, a  double bind.  We also tend to use more correct  speech.  This has been researched  in the United States and in England  by Trudgill, Wolfram, Shuy and  Labov. Various reasons are put  forward for this - the most prevalent refers to the relation between  speech and status.  Because we are plainly aware of our second class  status we use correct English in a  vain attempt to maintain, if not  elevate, our position.  Our Style Of Interacting  Contrary to popular belief women talk  less than men in mixed interactions.  This has been researched by Argyle  et al., Strotbeck, Hilpert et al.,  Kramer, Soskin and Swaker. Also,  researchers have found we interrupt  less and do not actively respond to  male interruptions. We have difficulty getting and maintaining the  attention of a group, especially in  a task-oriented situation.  Various researchers have found that  our utterances and writings are considered to lack authority by both  sexes.  In other words, our talk is  considered trivial, and men often  respond in a patronizing way.  Jessie Bernard differentiates between  instrumental and expressive talk -  "the first having to do with orientation, facts and information, and the  second with feelings, positive or  negative." Cultural expectations  are that we will be mainly concerned  with the latter. Researchers have  found this is the case. We work hard  to maintain the conversation, often  falling into a pattern of asking  questions, or apologizing for our  behavior. We learn to control our  speech, thus supporting the impression we are living in the background,  on the fringe. This is certainly not  the dialogue of equals.  SMILG!  SMILE!  Non-Verbal Communication  "Social 'interaction is the arena where  women are continually being chewed  up...Women are constantly being put  down when they act uppity, or reminded  to stay down even when they don't, by  many little reminders of their inferior status...examples are environmental clues, non-content aspects of  language and movement & gesture in  interaction."  (Henley)  We respond to these reminders with  gestures of submission and appeasement  such as lowering our eyes, and smiling.  In fact our behaviors indicate our  attempts to seek approval from the  dominant males. That we smile more  than men has been noted by Chessler,  Firestone and Key.  As Key says, "In  fact they smile more than males throughout their lifetime, if they learned  their lesson well - that females are  supposed to be pleasant."  Henley's research indicates women are  touched more than men.  She suggests  touching has a dual nature of either  indicating intimacy or status (the  toucher being of higher status). Thus,  touching, unfortunately, is another  important reminder of our role as object and subservient.  Conclusion  The purpose of these comments is not  to suggest that men are the enemy and  the cause of our condition.  Cynthia  Ozick wrote "Society, remember, is  above men and women; it acts in men  and women.  So you must not make the  mistake of thinking that the culture  of women is the conspiracy of men.  mm mmgu1 &jm<§>w&®i  IP     A      PfRSorv/  \_D£TER^\lN£pj  HE   'S^^ she:    is  Persistant nagsinq  [NOTj^AUflFULl  [SENSITIVE!  <^l  |4_J)£C|S{0N   tAAK^RJ  HE   IS SHE IS  AN UPTIGtrr RITtH  [■Sexually   active,  HE   IS SHE IS  i OPPRESSED!

If language does influence thought it  is important for us to continually  assess our use of the language so the  words we use no longer block our expressions of our authenticity. The  power of language is so pervasive and  subtle, even for the most aware of us;  the process is difficult and fraught  with many lapses into traditional  behavior.  Language can be considered an expression of shared assumptions.  But as  we become more aware of our authenticity we question these assumptions  and the concomitant implicit values  and behavioral models.  As a result  communication with men may become  more difficult.  Conscious action to  eliminate the sexism in language and  our modes of communication which  perpetuate the myth of us as outsiders could lead to a more androgynous society.  The change will not  come easily because of our conditioning, the necessity of functioning  in the day-to-day world and because  men may not easily accept the change  in our status.  But as Judy Chicago  says, "As long as we go to men, move  into their sphere without demanding  that they move simultaneously into  ours we will always be the other in  their world."  ©   CjUNILLA    MUNGAIV    H">S"  At the end of January, Janet Summerton  begins a six-week course on the sex-  differences in language. This course  is being organized by UBC's Women's  Resources Centre, which is part of the  Continuing Education Department.  It  is being held at the Resource Centre's  location on the third floor of the  Vancouver Public Library.  NO COMMENT  On January 4, The Vancouver Sun carried a front page interview with Janet  Summerton.  It was a classic example  of the need for Summerton's work.  On the fact that we talk more  quickly to men than we do to each  other (an attempt to get it all said  before we are interrupted, dismissed  and trivialized):  "The little woman at home - heh heh  - isn't going to like this but I  sometimes hear her going a mile a  minute whether I'm in the room or  not."  On the way in which words such as  'cute', 'lovely' and 'adorable' are  restricted for use by women:  "Not  quite.  Though you should have seen  the way everyone looked at the guy  who sits behind me at work when he  started talking like that."  When Summerton pointed out to him  that men occupy more personal space,  and that consequently a man feels  more at ease touching a woman than  vice versa:  "True, but only in a  pinch." SPECIAL SIX PAG€ SECTION  what does  it mean ?  where is it  going?  Affirmative Action has been heralded as a major breakthrough for  women.  "Equal pay for equal work"  has been a catch-phrase of the  women's movement since its inception.  Affirmative Action laws  were enacted in the U.S. in 1965.  The Canadian government has instituted an equal opportunities  program for its public servants.  In the B.C. legislature, Rosemary  Brown has called for adoption of a  far-reaching Affirmative Action  program.  Both the Vancouver Resources Board and City Hall have  undertaken studies dealing with affirmative action.  Corporations,  in some cases, have "seen the  writing on the wall" and have instituted their own equal opportunity programs.  What does all this mean and where  is it leading us?  Let's look in more detail at some  of these actions and at conditions  in the work force to see if we can  answer those questions.  The ghettoization of the Canadian  working woman has increased, not  decreased, over the past decade.  Sylvia Gelber, director of the  Women's Bureau in the Department  of Labour, describes "the ever-  increasing occupational segregation  of the female labour force into  low-paying occupations." ■ Seventy-  two percent of all women workers  are in the service, retail and  clerical areas, and the percentage  of women employed in those areas  is going up.  In 1963, 30 in every  100 women workers were clerical;  in 1974, 36 in every 100 were clerical workers.  Every year, women make less in  every job category.  Every year,  the. wage gap widens.  Men make more  even in those jobs which are so  called "women's jobs."  In 1973,  the male clerical worker earned  34.2% more than the average female  clerical worker.  The average woman  earns about 45% less than the average man.  A QUICK FEMINIST QUIZ.

IS THIS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?  Canada does not have specific affirmative action legislation, nor  do any of the provinces.  Although  there are "equal pay" laws in all  provinces, they are sufficiently  vague to render them largely ineffective.  Rosemary Brown, British Columbia  NDP/MLA, last year introduced a  private, member's bill in the House  dealing with an Affirmative Action  Plan defined as:  "a plan, program, scheme or schedule setting out the proposal of an  employer for promoting full equality between men and women in all  aspects of employment and education, including hiring, promoting,  superannuation, training and retraining, and access to jobs."  Acceptance by the government of  the principle of an Affirmative  Action Plan, the Act goes on: ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  IS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS PHOTOGRAPH?  "is a recognition by the recipient  of provincial government monies  that the onus of responsibility  for ending sexual inequality in  society rests fully upon these institutions. ..government departments,  Crown Corporations, government  commissions, boards and agencies  ...not on the individual."  Any individual "aggrieved by the  failure of such institutions...  shall have access to the Courts.  "Ninety days after the coming into  force of this Act, any recipient  of provincial government monies  not having registered an Affirmative Action Plan will no longer  receive provincial government  monies."  v.r.b. program  The Vancouver Resources Board's  Affirmative Action Committee, in  February 1976, presented an overall  plan to the Board which accepted  it unanimously and assigned staff  and program funds to the committee.  Subsequently, the plan was incorporated into the Collective Agreement.  This is the first time that  a detailed Affirmative Action Plan  has been written into a contract  with a public service agency in  Canada.  The fall 1976 interim report of the  committee shows, in addition to  other findings dealing with minorities and handicapped, that not  only are men and women not represented evenly in most job classes,  but that men get the highest salaries in every job class even in  those traditionally female bastions;  clerical, housekeeping, social work.  (Further confirming the 1973 Department of Labour statistics.)  Among the committee's recommendations  are: 1) that the VRB adhere to the  principle that qualifications and  ability are the prime considerations  in hiring and promotion decisions;  2) that the VRB adopt, as a long-  term goal, a policy of 50:50 participation of men and women in all  job categories in the VRB work  force; 3) that sex-segregated job  classes be examined in order to  develop ways of assisting employees  to move to other jobs, and to encourage the gradual desegregation  of all such job classes.  city hall  Vancouver City Hall has a Special  Committee re Equal Employment. It  was struck during Philip's reign  as Mayor. At the moment, studies  have been commenced to gather  data upon the employment patterns  of people with disabilities, of  visible minorities and of women.  Shelagh Day, a Provincial Human  Rights Officer,has coordinated the  gathering of data upon the employment of women at City Hall. Her  findings, and those of groups  reponsible for reporting upon the  employment of the handicapped, are  well advanced. Within the next  few weeks, Councillor Darlene  Marzari, a Committee member, will  be taking a proposal to Council  which will provide funding for  the collection of data upon the  employment of minority groups.  If Marzari's bid is successful  (and VSW gives it full support)  City Hall will have a completed  study sometime later this year.  BUT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO  THEN? So far, Volrich et. al.  have shown little commitment..  VSW MEMBERS ARE URGED TO LOBBY  COUNCILLORS AND THE MAYOR IN ORDER  TO RAISE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT  THIS ISSUE.  bonnie  webster  Bonnie Webster, of E.L. Webster &  Associates, a local firm engaged  in management consulting, feels  that "affirmative action" evokes a  negative response in the management  people she has spoken with.  Ms.  Webster surmises it is because of  affiliations with U.S. companies  who were forced to adopt affirmative action policies by law and the  subsequent court cases, etc., since  1965.  The U.S. experience has  made these management people wary  —"equal opportunity" is fine;  "affirmative action" is not.  Ms. Webster, who quit her job at  B.C. Tel to start her company, was  motivated by a desire to make a  personal contribution to International Women's Year.  She feels  "it's necessary for women to organize numbers talk." What is  needed is for women, all women in  a firm, to organize first, and  then present a collective proposal  of their demands to management.  Otherwise, it is too easy for management to use the union and salaried women against one another.  Ms. Webster admits, however, that  "cross-class" organizing is probably difficult.  Salaried or  management women are afraid, realistically, that their career  chances will be hurt.  Much of Ms. Webster's work is with  corporations wanting or needing to  integrate more women into management.  She doesn't feel that an  emphasis on identifying and training women for management positions  will take away from training or  needs at the lower levels.  There seems to be an increase in  "job enrichment" programs.  Why?  With increasing mechanization,  workers become discontented, productivity falls, and employers  become concerned.  Ms. Webster  tells her corporate clients that  it's to their benefit to adopt  "equal opportunity" programs for  women.  The Financial Post (June  21, 1975) agrees:  "it may be important to determine  the level of women's discontent.  If the company is facing a near-  revolution, getting on with an  equal opportunity program may be  a matter of some urgency, and a  number of short-term actions may  be required.  Conversely, and  more likely, if discontent is  quietly simmering, an orderly,  carefully phased program may be  both sufficient and more constructive in the long term." (!)  When asked if she saw any  "co-optation" problems (e.g. the  drawing off of the young, upwardly  mobile women to "ride herd" on the  other women) Ms. Webster hesitated  and said, "I tend to be idealistic;  but I hope that doesn't happen."  I U.S. AFFIRMATIV€ ACTION  UNDER ATTACK  PROPOSED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULES  CHALLENGED BY WOMEN'S AND CIVIL  RIGHTS GROUPS  NEW YORK (LNS) - Another hard-won  gain of the 1960's, the Affirmative  Action program, is in serious trouble, and scores of women's and civil  rights organizations are fighting a  proposed watering down of the program at government hearings in New  York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and  Chicago in early December.  Affirmative action rules currently  cover over one-third of the U.S.  workforce by requiring companies  with large government contracts to  actively aid women and minorities  with hiring, training and promotion.  The new and highly controversial  affirmative action regulations claim  to streamline the program and make  existing regulations easier to under-  s tand.  But civil rights and women's groups,  after extensive review of the new  regulations, have concluded that the  proposed changes, to quote testimony  by Gloria Parker of the National  Urban League at New York hearings  December 6-10, "are dangerously regressive and represent an overt move  to sabotage more than a decade of  progress."  Said the New York group Women Office  Workers, "If these new regulations  are implemented they won't cut out  red tape, they'll cut out the guts  of affirmative action."  The proposed regulations would require only companies with government  contracts over $100,000 and with  more than 100 employees to prepare  written affirmative action plans.  (The previous cut-off was $50,000  in contracts and 50 employees.)  Complete figures on the number of  companies affected by this one change  are not available, but the number  would drop dramatically - from over  100,000 to less than 100, according  to one estimate.  The number of government contractors  subject to review before the award  of government contracts would be cut  substantially too: only companies  with $10 million in contracts will  be subject to pre-award compliance  review, as opposed to those with $1  million contracts before.  ABOUT 30 MILLION WORKERS, OR ONE  THIRD OF THE NATION'S TOTAL  WORKFORCE ARE AFFECTED BY THIS  PROGRAM.  UNDER THE NEW REGULATIONS, INVESTIGATION OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  COMPLAINTS WILL BECOME OPTIONAL.  ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN THE RULES  ARE ALL DESIGNED TO PERMIT MORE  BUREAUCRATIC MANOEUVERING BY  COMPANIES TO AVOID COMPLYING  WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS.  THE NEW RULES GIVE UP ANY PRETENSE OF REAL ENFOCEMENT OF  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ON THE PART  OF THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE  PROFITED FROM DISCRIMINATORY  LABOUR PRACTICES FOR YEARS.  This one change, Women Office Workers  (WOW) estimates, will cut the number  of colleges and universities required  to undergo pre-award reviews from  between 8 and 10,000 to only five  institutions.  The Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) also gains more power to exempt specific contracts and  establishments from the affirmative  action regulations if it is in the  "national interest"* Complaints  about non-compliance can be referred  to the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) which with a  backlog of 120,000 cases, is essentially non-functional.  Built-in  time limitations for compliance are  eliminated in the new ruling, encouraging delay and non-compliance.  "A cabinet-level department (OFCCP)  has set out to rescind" the Executive Order establishing Affirmative  Action and to "substitute an enfeebling directive", a National  Organization for Women (NOW) representative testified in New York  hearings December 6-10.  According to Oscar Garcia-Rivera,  directorvof the Puerto Rican Legal  Defense and Education Fund in New  York, "It is at best graceless for  this administration in its waning  days to seek to change - by considerably weakening - regulations which  at least are committed on paper to  the goal of equal employment oppor-  meanS Women are auaran-  teed an et{uai shot      .  at no>b£.  •  ^U4^J  tunity by employers being given  directly billions of dollars in  tax-payers money."  OFCCP's proposed new regulations  were published September 17 in the  Federal Register, which relatively  few people see, with a standard 60-  day comment period before they  would go into effect. Working women's groups such as Women Employed  in Chicago and WOW in New York had  heard about the upcoming changes  and had requested copies of the proposed regulations as early as June.  But OFCCP director Lawrence Lorber  never responded to their requests.  Meanwhile the "Equal Employment Advisory Council", which represents  large corporations and the National  Association of Manufacturers, were  studying drafts of the proposed  regulations and met with OFCCP to  "refine" them.  Once women's and minority organizations read the new regulations, the  reason for the OFCCP's reluctance  to publicize the changes became  clear. Lorber originally denied  their requests for hearings, and it  was only through a hard fight that  the comment period was extended and  the hearings granted. Written comment can now be submitted until December 27, with the new rules ex*-  pected to appear in the Federal  Register 30 days later.  The Affirmative Action program as it  now operates is far from effective.  But the proposed revisions, according to Women Office Workers, "merely  codify and further institutionalize  that failure."  "The solution ought to be to commit  more resources, not to reduce the  scope of the coverage." affirmative action:  WHAT W€ STAND TO LOS€  The following are excerpts from an  article by Laurell Ritchie which  appeared in This Magazine. Laurell  Ritchie is an organizer with the  Canadian Textile and Chemical Union,  and a Board Member of the National  Action Committee on the Status of  Women.  Take a look folks.  It's the Affirmative Action Programme.  Good for all  that ails working women! A powerful  new tool! A modern miracle drug!  Or so we're being told.  Affirmative Action is the name given  to programmes set up in various corporations and institutions, both public and private, to promote equal  hiring and promotional opportunities  for women.  It's not exactly a household word yet, but give it time.  Based on the Affirmative Action programmes now in effect for federal and  provincial crown employees, a model  programme would initially involve  securing top level corporate commitment and the establishment of a programme administrator and advisory  council within the firm.  The next  step would be to collect data on the  sex breakdown of the internal work  force, job categories, salary levels,  etc. and to identify women with potential for development and training.  Based on this information, a file on  "promotables" would be built up for  reference when job vacanacies occur  in areas of underrepresentation. The  company would also develop an active  non-discriminatory recruitment programme. ' '  Other efforts would be made to set up  job ladders and rearrange tasks to  eliminate dead-end jobs.  While no quotas are involved, there  would be target dates for improvement and a monitoring and evaluation  system.  Universities, banks, unions, civic  governments, the federal and provincial civil service, the CBC, Canadian  University Students Overseas (CUSO),  and a dozen other insitutions have  recently tabled "Status of Women" reports, virtually all of which call for  Affirmative Action programmes as "the"  answer to the discrimination unearthed.  So what's the fuss?  Why would anyone  challenge Affirmative Action? Don't  we support equal opportunity for women?  oo-opfafion  Equal job opportunity and equal pay  have long been priorities of the Canadian women's movement and so they  should be, as fundamental economic  issues. At a time when the gap between men and women's earnings is  actually widening, when women are  increasingly ghettoized into a limited  spectrum of jobs, when they are  wrapped in dead-end jobs and face  discrimination in job benefits, we  all feel the need for immediate action.  But we often become lazy. We lose  grip of the tactics, the programmes,  the strategies. We attach ourselves  to the initiatives of Canadian governments or the American women's  movement, and call them our own —  without much questioning.  But we  should question.  Affirmative Action, for example,  would appear to be a very broad term  that could cover many of the demands  being put forth by working women. If  we were sitting down for the first  time to define an Affirmative Action  programme, we might want to include  everything from child care to skill  training to equal pay for work of  equal value.  But Affirmative Action was not defined  by the women's movement. Its historical definition was molded by corporations and governments. And that definition is a dangerously narrow one.  In fact, Affirmative Action has become  the brand name for employer programmes  geared to co-opting upwardly-mobile,  career-oriented women into corporate  management. A carrot is being dangled  to draw off the young, articulate,  English-speaking, intelligent, energetic, self-confident women to positions of control where they will be  required to ride shotgun on the rising  demands of other women.  We are witnessing the emergence of the  Corporate Woman.  From the point of view of government  and industry, it would seem to be the  cheapest and least disruptive method  of accommodating an ever-growing and  unpredictable women's movement.  Let's look for a moment at the origins  of Affirmative Action.  american  history  Affirmative Action was developed in  the United States as a legislative  response to the demands of Blacks and  other minorities, such as Spanish-  speaking Americans.  A law was introduced with complicated  goals, quotas, and timetables requiring companies to employ the protected minorities in the same ratio  as they were represented in the relevant labour market and to increase  their numbers in the higher corporate  echelons.  Then came a growing concern about demands being made by the American  women's movement.  In 1972, the American government  introduced a law requiring government  contractors to initiate Affirmative  Action programmes, with goals and  timetables, to provide equal promotion  and placement opportunities for women.  "As amended by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Act of 1972 (Public Law  92-261), Title VII covers employers  with 25 or more employees, public  and private employment agencies,  labor unions with 25 or more members,  labor-management apprenticeship  programs, state and local government agencies, and public and private educational institutions.  Effective March 24, 1973, employers  with 15 or more employees and labor  unions with 15 or more members will  come under the provisions of the  law. Title VII forbids an employer  to discriminate between men and  women with reference to hiring,  discharge and compensation, and to  terms, conditions or privileges of  employment.  Employees may not be  segregated or classified in any  way that would tend to deprive a  woman or a man of employment opportunities because of sex.  "Conditions of employment in which  it is unlawful to discriminate include (but are not limited to) job  assignment, layoff and recall,  promotions, training, sick leave  time and pay (including maternity  leave), medical and insurance coverage and overtime."  American business considered these  programmes a bitter pill indeed but  their own corporate journals were  warning that survival from the  "Women's Revolution" could depend on  the implementation of Affirmative  Action programmes and the integration  of women into management.  Corporations were told that such programmes  would be the best defense against  costly litigations in the courts and  destructive wholesale investigations  of other company practices by the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  Barbara Boyle, an American expert  on Affirmative Action (who is a partner in a New York City management  consulting firm and has been retained  by Canadian National and other corporations to develop Affirmative Action here in Canada) elaborated on  the corporate point of view in an  article entitled "Equal Opportunity  for Women is Smart Business":  "...the fact is that women are  working and must be considered as  a resource that needs to be effectively managed, motivated and utilized... just like men.  "From a dollar standpoint, the female labour force constitutes an  important reservoir of talent which  is necessary to use to remain competitive in the business world. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL  "...corporate leaders can no longer  ignore half the population when they  are looking for creative and executive talent...Kept in 'women-type'  jobs, they have not efficiently used  their aptitudes, intelligence, education and skills.  "...many women decide that they are  not interested or do not have the  ability to move into management positions or new areas of responsibility.  They are, however, more productive  and happier employees after this decision is reached because they have  had a choice."  Even job training is seen by the corporations as part of the upward mobility theme.  Business magazines  reason that "Women will have to be  given additional exposure in new jobs  and duties at the same level in order  to provide the seasoning necessary  for upward advancement."  As one reads the many, many articles  on the American Affirmative Action  programme, equal opportunity begins  to sound like nothing more than a  giant game of numbers. One starts  to envisage each corporation operating its own abacus, manipulating the  'female employee' beads and the 'male  employee' beads up and down the plus  and minus columns - all in the name  of complying with legislation.  A few  women go 'up', a few men go 'down'.  But it's still the same old framework.  Canadian  experience  As early as 1973, articles on Affirmative Action started appearing in  Canadian business magazines.  The  March, 1975 issue of Canadian Personnel and Industrial Relations Journal  carried an article on "Positive Action  for Integrating Women Into Management"  which rationalized Affirmative Action  as follows:  "Management talent will be the major  shortage during the 1975-1985 period.  In addition, we are facing a productivity crisis which can be met only  by effective management and maximum  utilization of human resources.  A  program directed at the inclusion of  women in the term 'human resources'  is not only socially responsible but  makes economic sense. We need manage-  ers, and we need productivity.  Why  not use all our workerpower to meet  these needs?"  The corporate agenda became that much  clearer as business magazines continued to feature articles such as "The  Executive Suite - Feminine Style".  Upward mobility was always the theme.  Meanwhile, Canadian women read about  the astronomical figures being awarded  in U.S. courts under the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the Civil  Rights Act.  Many of the settlements  involved millions of dollars of back  pay for past discrimination in hiring  and promotions. The idea of Affirmative Action appealed to the upwardly-  mobile, career-oriented women who  stood to gain under such a programme.  In Canada, various governments started  setting up Affirmative Action guidelines for their own employees.  When  Janet Smith spoke in Montreal in 1974  she was coordinator for the Office of  Equal Opportunity for Women in the  Federal Public Service.  She explained  how their Affirmative Action programme  was operating - how job competitions  were being opened up to both sexes,  how the number of women in senior and  middle management was increasing ana  how more women were to be put on  management-trainee programmes.  But she also had the following to say:  "Women still get paid less on the  average than men in the same category.  This is to be expected in areas where  women have less experience, such as  management.  But this is also true  in the support category (including  clerks, secretaries, and telephone  operators).  In 1973,' men averaged  $7,840, women $6,650.  In 1969, the  average man in the support category  earned approximately $900 more than  the average women.  In 1973, the wage  gap in favour of the men, widened to  $1,190."  In any case, Affirmative Action was  off to a quiet start in Canada.  Then, suddenly, it was International  Women's Year.  The federal government, along with  various provincial and civic governments, seized upon Affirmative Action  as their pet project for 1975.  Ontario Premier Bill Davis held a conference in February of 1975 calling  for voluntary Affirmative Action efforts from the "Captains of Industry"  assembled in a posh Toronto hotel.  Prime Minister Trudeau held a similar  conference in Ottawa in November for  chief executive officers of major  Canadian employers, each delegate  attending at the personal invitation  of the Prime Minister. But the  federal government's emphasis on  Affirmative Action did not go unprotested. A group of Ottawa women  picketing outside that conference  called such programmes "window-dressing", "a superficial change" and  "a minor issue".  A Critical View  The Canadian women's movement must  take a more critical view of Affirmative Action:  - Women must examine the realities  of the work force before putting an  emphasis on the lack of women in  corporate managements since managerial positions are necessarily fewer  than jobs covering direct production,  service or clerical work.  Statistics  Canada tables indicate that on average, only 1 worker in 10 is in a  managerial position.  The emphasis  must be on issues and demands that  touch the lives of the majority of  women, not an elite.  The task facing the Canadian women's  movement, now as always, is to maintain the priority and primacy of issues which speak to the mass of Canadian women, not the few who are used  as role models for the corporate world.  We cannot go about telling the women  at their typewriters or sewing machines "Forget your lousy working conditions and pay.  Someday you too may  be a supervisor."  The women's movement must give guidance to the fight for real changes.  Neither governments nor corporations  are going to lead the way on issues  that challenge one of the key ingredients of their profitable industries  - the use of women as a reserve pool  of cheap labour.  As Grace Hartman, now President of  the Canadian Union of Public Employees  has said:  "Hand in hand with the move to make  women a part of the mainstream, there  should be a parallel move to make  life easier for the woman who will  never be a senior executive in business or government...In the long run,  what is more important to women:  Making a symbolic infiltration of  the fire department, or having enough  money to put bread on the table? That  is the fundamental question of liberation.y  our economy  literally depends  on the use of  women as a  reserve pool  of cheap labour  - The exploitation of women is deeply  rooted in the structure of our economy.  Our economy literally depends on the  use of women (and immigrants) as a reserve pool of cheap labour.  But there  is nothing in Affirmative Action that  challenges this fundamental economic  problem.  Affirmative Action in fact  presents a non-antagonistic, attitud-  inal approach rather than a structural  approach.  It allows governments and  corporations to sell the public on  the idea that women's emancipation is  only a "matter of attitude", while  they reassure themselves that equality  for women won't cost them much more  than the cost of a consulting firm.  Companies can rethink "attitudes",  promote a few women and never really  touch the corporate pocketbook.  But  women's equality will take more than  a change in "attitude". AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  Ritchie summarises her position on  Affirmative Action with the following  points...  - Affirmative Action promotes the  ultra-feminist position that woman's  emancipation is complete when she  achieves equality with men.  Not only  that, but she must be capable of going  "where the men are" to find that  equality.  But women need men as allies on many fronts. Affirmative Action could well be used to drive a  wedge in the common cause of men and  women fighting other forms of injustice in the workplace.  In talking  of Affirmative Action, one hopeful  Canadian business journal suggested  that this could all be leading to "an  international Union of Women of America (sic) with members in several industries".  Nothing could be more  destructive to the union movement in  this country.  - Affirmative Action will divide  women into the 'promotables', 'the  less than enthusiastic promotables',  and the 'unpromotables'.  A women's  movement embracing programmes that  create such divisions chances losing  allies and credibility among lower-  income women, native women, and  immigrant women (who together probably form the majority of working  women in this country).  The women  who don't 'make it' will have good  cause to see articulate, able women  as enemies and competition rather  than an leaders who will assist them  in fighting for justice for all.  - The huge cash settlements made in  the U.S. courts for suits under the  Affirmative Action programme are not  going to necessarily follow for Canadian women.  First of all, there is  not the same division of powers in  the Canadian legislative and judicial systems,  and secondly, the  American multinationals that predominate in Canada will be better prepared the second time around.  Business journals already offer advice  under such titles as "Make Your Equal  Opportunity Program Court-Proof".  - Recognition must be given to the  role of the American multi-nationals  in the exportation and promotion of  Affirmative Action for Canadian women.  Our governments have had in mind a  pale carbon copy of the American original, one that would be acceptable  to those corporations. Of course,  IBM will consider moving some women  up in the ranks. After all, they've  already made the initial investments  with some American consulting firm  to set up an appropriate programme  for their homebase operations.  But were we to move in the direction  of paying women better wages for the  work they are doing now, thereby cutting off one of the chief sources of  cheap labour in this country, the  threats of shutdown would fly fast  and furious.  We would be told that we had just  priced ourselves out of the international market.  Which raises a very serious question  for the women's movement in Canada.  How can the fight for women's equality  in this country ever be won if it is  not clearly connected with the fight  for an independent economy, an economy  which could incorporate such social  goals as the economic equality of  women?  - Affirmative Action is easily promoted as a panacea for the problems  of working women.  But sexism in employment goes well beyond discrimination in hiring and promotions.  Sexism is used as a tool to exploit  women, en masse, in the service,  clerical and sales jobs where they  predominate:  "Affirmative Action might be acceptable if it was clearly indicated as  only one ingredient in an overall  government programme to establish:  -equal pay for work of equal value  -adequate child care facilities  -improved pregnancy leave  -improved labour laws that would  make union organization less formidable  -strengthened laws on equal pensions and benefits."  As mentioned in the introduction,  this article appeared in full in  This Magazine. They are located at  3 Church Street, Toronto and this  article appeared in their March-  April '76 issue.  The purpose of this presentation  upon Affirmative Action is to  introduce readers to the nature of  the issue and to several of the  debates surrounding it. We look  forward to some response from  readers in the hope that informed  debate might ensue in these pages  which would serve to educate us all,  (eds.)  At the Vancouver Status of Women,  we recognise that Affirmative  Action programs are only one  step towards the liberation of  women. While working for the implementation of Affirmative  Action schemes, we also demand  quality childcare, equal pay  for work of equal value, just  maternity benefits and more  equitable pensions and benefits.  We also recognise that the wage  gap is widening in every job category and that unemployment among  women has increased greatly over  the last decade. We see women  working as bank tellers for  years without chances of promotion. We see them training men at  their work, and we know that these  men aren't tellers; they're management trainees. Anything that can  be done to break down the female  job ghettoes, and to breach the  wage gap, must be done. VSW is  in full support of the Labour  policy developed by BCFW (the  British Columbia Federation of  Women) which calls for the implementation of affirmative action  schemes by government and by  unions in cooperation with the  women's movement. This final  stipulation is vital. We must  raise our demands so that we are  working for what we want, not for  what they tell us we want.  VSW has several immediate goals  for the implementation of  Affirmative Action schemes in  B.C.  Firstly, we give our full support to the moves to implement  Affirmative Action Schemes within  the Provincial Government. There  are 37,701 persons in the B.C.  Public Service. Although 55% of  these public servants are women,  they are not represented at  significant levels in the power  structure. Organizations which  purport to represent the composition of Canadian society must  take sex as well as age, education etc into account to ensure  that they truly represent the  views of all citizens.  Secondly, we support Affirmative  Action programs at the level  of city government. We demand  that the Mayor and Council  commit themselves to the full  implementation of the Affirmative Action Scheme at City  Hall. In particular, we advocate  the appointment of a liaison  person directly reponsible to  the Mayor or to the city manager,  who can direct department heads  to take affirmative action.  We cannot allow City Hall simply  to accumulate a bunch of data.  They must begin now upon designing a program for implementing  affirmative action.

Winter has set in but with no  vengeance as yet. The first "staying"  snow fell on Christmas Eve, which is  very late, and the temp, hasn't  dropped below minus 20 yet.  I'm trying to remember when I last  sat down to collect my thoughts - I  think it was in mid-November. I have  not done a lot of travelling since then  just a trip to Fort Nelson, Dawson  Creek and then down to Vancouver.  Fort Nelson was fascinating - located  300 miles north of Fort St.John on the  Alaska highway, it is an ancient  village and trading post now rejuvenated by the logging and natural gas  industries. I was reminded of how far  north it was when the sun set (at the  end of November) at about 3.00 each  day.  I stayed with Audrey Greer (one  of the few women Canada Personpower  managers in BC) in her beautiful log  house and I met some really energetic  women. The Fort Nelson Daycare Society  has just received LIP monies to conduct  a survery of the interests and needs  of the Fort Nelson women, with long  term plans to develop a rec centre,  a community service directory, drop-in  and information centre. February is  known as the suicide month in Fort  Nelson - for women, that is. The long  winter nights and short days in an  isolated, male-oriented community take  an annual toll. So we are left grasping for minimal LIP monies to patch  up an inadequate social service system  in the north.  Some of our contracts are now underway. Marie Mitchell has put together  an intensive two-day skill development  workshop that she will be taking to  about eight or nine northern communities over the next two-and-a-hali;  months. Topics include: "Structures  and levels of governments and institutions"; "Methods of dealing with  those Structures"; "Publicity";  "Developing local women's issues";  and "Political Skill Development".  Many of the women here know the  problems in their communities, but  the system is so mind-boggling that  it keeps them in a passive, powerless position. These workshops will  look at that position, question it  and start to change it.  And this weekend we have the first  formal meeting of the Northern B.C.  Women's Task Force on Single Industry  Towns! Ellie Burton and Chris Wozney  fly in from Kitimat tonight; Emily  Pacholuk and Gina Baker drive down  from Fraser Lake tomorrow, as do  Joan Kotarski and Karen Klassen from  Mackenzie. Three members of the  Women's Research Centre (Gene Errington, Helga Jacobson and Linda Yancy)  are flying up tomorrow to teach  research skills and to coordinate  work plans.  That's all for now,  Diana Bissell  Prince George  January 14, 1977.  jraser valley  ISHTAR WOMEN'S COLLECTIVE has produced  a half-hour T.V. program for Western  Cable 10 in Surrey. The whole production is handled by women: camera work,  directing, interviewing, program planning, etc. This year Ishtar women have  been joined in the production work by  other women from the Fraser Valley  Women's Coalition. Even with this infusion of new woman power, the work  load is heavy. The 'work' is fun and  challenging and the Ishtar women would  like more women, particularly from  New West, Surrey and Langley and environs to share the experience with  them.

A  major need of women today is access  to support and information regarding  the changing image of women.  The  Women's Centre is trying to foster a  positive feeling for women in this  respect. For this reason and in response to repeated demands from the  women of the community, they have  started discussion groups about the  following:  Feminist Study Group  Young Mothers Group  Mid-Life Group  Self-image Group  Young Women's Group  Among future plans the centre will  be sponsoring week-end workshops such  as Assertiveness Training, Sexuality,  Verbal and Physical Self-Defense, etc.  The LIP grant received for the work  at the centre covers a statistical  survey on Women and Work in Powell  River. This survey will interview  women in an effort to identify, evaluate and document the particular difficulties women may have in their  integration or re-integration into the  labour market, and to identify areas  where job training is necessary.  Any woman interested in further information about the above programs may call  the centre at 483-3781 or drop in for a  cup of tea and a chat during the following hours:  Monday and Tuesday 11-3,  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 11 - 5,  Saturday 1-4, and Sunday 7 - 9 p.m. ICFW  BRITISH COLUMBIA FEDERATION OF WOMEN  has a position open for an INTERNAL  COMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZER.  This is a volunteer position which  involves:  - being a member of the 1976-77  Standing Committee;  - being responsible for putting  out a mimeo newsletter after each  Standing Committee meeting - which  occurs bi-monthly.  The Standing Committee travels to  communities throughout B.C. for several of its meetings.  For further  information contact Susan Sanderson,  734-2827 or 876-2865.  The second Standing Committee Meeting  of the 1976-77 year is happening in  Vancouver, on February 5 and 6. The  meeting is taking place at the B.C.  Federation of Labour office, 517 E.  Broadway.  Interested observers are  welcome to attend, but are advised to  contact the Co-ordinator regarding  available space and times.  Phone  Susan Sanderson, 734-2827 or 876-2865  for further information.  RIGHTS OF LESBIANS SUBCOMMITTEE  OF THE B.C.FEDERATION OF WOMEN  held their first subcommittee  meeting of the year in Vancouver  on January 15, '77. 30 women  attended this meeting, and there  was representation from Vancouver  Island, the Fraser Valley and the  Lower Mainland.  The role of the Subcommittee was  discussed, along with the recommendations passed at the BCFW convention  in Vernon. As an action area of BCFW,  it is one of our responsibilities  to implement all of BCFW policy.  Although some legal changes are  necessary, the major changes necessary to eliminate lesbian oppression  are those of attitude. This is  where every woman involved in BCFW  and in the women's movement can  begin to assume responsibilty for  the fight against the oppression  of lesbians.  In order for both lesbians and feminists to work towards a clear political  analysis of lesbianism/feminism,  the Rights of Lesbians Subcommitee  will continue to offer a workshop on  lesbianism/feminism. This workshop is  designed for every BCFW member and  includes:  - a presentation and discussion of  lesbian feminist theory  - an explanation and discussion of  ,the myths and fears surrounding  lesbiansim  - a sharing of strategies for dealing  with the topic of lesbianism in  groups, families, etc.  We have been invited to do two workshops in Campbell River for their  conference in February.  Again this year the Subcommittee  has formed several small groups in  areas of particular concerns, such  as:  we're  Sisters  - Lesbian/feminist workshops (this  group does the workshops)  - Lesbian mothers  - Lesbians and Education  - Lesbians and Employment  - Lesbians and the Media  - Lesbians and Therapy  These groups meet regularly, then  bring their findings and action  proposals back to the General Meetings.  If you are interested in either  being part of the general Rights  of Lesbians Subcommittee or in  working on any specific aspect of  our "sub-sub-committees" (and  there are certainly many fronts  one could work on!), call this  number for further information:  872 2156.  The next Subcommittee meeting is  on Sunday, February 20th, at 1.00  in the afternoon at VSW - 2029 W.  4th Ave.  Canada has a new, bilingual newsletter, LESBIAN CANADA LESBIENNE.  The  energy for the newsletter grew out  of the national lesbian conference  held in Ottawa in October of last  year.  At that conference, it was agreed to  form local branches in five regions  of Canada: the Atlantic provinces,  Quebec, Ontario, the Prairies and  British Columbia. Each region had  its own meeting, and selected representatives who later met with the  representatives of the other regions  to set up networks of communication.  At this meeting, the idea of the  newsletter was conceived, as the  editors explain, "to keep the hot  feminist blood flowing, to keep the  lesbian pride burning and to keep  our political minds and our hearts  in touch with our sisters across the  country."  The women from the Atlantic provinces,  APPLE (Atlantic Provinces Political  Lesbians for Equality) have accepted  the responsibility of publishing the  newsletter.  Send contributions (and donations!)  to the APPLE women c/o Anne Fulton,  44 Arlington Avenue, Halifax, Nova  Scotia B3N 2A1.  The B.C. WOMEN'S STUDIES ASSOCIATION  CONFERENCE will be held on Saturday,  March 12, 1977 at Simon Fraser University in the South Court Lounge.  The conference will begin at 9:00  a.m. and finish at 5:30 p.m. There  will be a status report on the structure of women's studies in B.C., and  papers are invited in the following  areas: Women's Studies and Feminism;  Student Projects; Research on Women  and other Revelant Topics. Deadline  for abstracts is February 12, 1977.  Send all abstracts or requests for  information to Meredith Kimball,  Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies,  Simon Fraser University, Burnaby.  Dinner and an evening of entertainment will follow the conference.  Childcare is available, but pre-reg-  istration for care is essential.

SAV€  VSW  AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL OUR FRIENDS  RE: VSW FUNDING  DEAR FRIENDS,  As you may know, our core funding  from the Provincial Secretary expires on March 31, 1977, and we are  making another grant application in  the hear future. As you have been  kind enough to send us a letter of  support of VSW in the past, we are  hoping that you will be able to do  the same for us again this year.  Our basic services have not changed.  The three general areas we are involved in are: para-legal women's  rights counselling; public education  on the status of women; advocacy  for feminist legislation, programs  and funding.  Overall, the demand for our services  is increasing steadily beyond our  ability to deal with it, due to  our limited budget and staff. Our  ombudservice handled 1,200 cases  last year. We did about 90 speaking  engagements during that period,  and each month, about 50 requests  are made for information and publications from our reference library.  You might be interested to know that  of some 200 feminist groups in B.C.,  we were the only women's group that  received funding in 76-77 from the  Provincial Secretary. As a result,  almost one third of these groups  have now been forced to disband,  due to lack of funding. This makes  it all the more imperative that VSW  continue its services.  With loss of additional grants and  inflationary costs, our grant for  75-76 meant a reduction in staff,  and we have not raised their salaries,  which are quite modest, in two  years. Therefore, this year we are  applying for our original $75,000  plus an increase to hire more staff  and to increase wages. This will bring  us to $115,000.  This grant is by no means guaranteed  to us from one year to the next.  Therefore, a showing of COMMUNITY  SUPPORT FOR VSW is vital. We would  very much appreciate your support  in the form of a letter. It will  be sent along with our grant application to the Provincial Secretary.  Thank you so much for your help.  Nancy Conrod  President  Vancouver Status of Women  CHILDCARC  &S€XISTTAX€S  It's tax time.  If you are a  single parent mother, you will  already know that the Child Care  expenses of the Income Tax Act is  grossly sexist.  The Articling Student Caucus of the  National Women and Law Association  (85 Winchester Street, #4, Toronto,  Ontario) is organizing a national  protest against the sexist nature  of the Income Tax Act policy on  child care expenses. Their letter  follows. VSW urges its members to  send letters in support of this  action by the Women and Law Assoc,  to the appropriate Ministers who  are addressed at the top of their  letter* (All at the Parliament  Buildings in Ottawa, no stamp is  necessary). Send a cc- to VSW and  one to the Women and Law Assoc.  Ministers  Department of Finance  Department of Revenue  Department of Justice  Government of Canada  Dear People:  Re: Income Tax Act, s63, Child Care  Expenses.  It has come to our attention that  the reference income tax section is  discriminatory in its application. A  single parent father can deduct  more for child care expenses than  a single parent mother.  The Child care expenses section  contains other discriminatory aspects which should be investigated  and corrected.  1) The policy of this section is  unacceptable since it assumed a  woman must shoulder the child care  responsibility.  She must bear the  expense of the babysitter when she  goes out to work in the paid labour  force. Women generally earn 60%  of men's incomes. (Statistics Canada, Dept. of Labour, Women's Bureau) . Thus either her husband pays  for child care and she deducts it  (which is unfair to the husband,  who should be able to deduct his  real expenses). Or, she pays the  expenses (usually more than the  permitted deduction) and her earn  ing power and consequently, her  financial independence is considerably reduced. This sex-stereotyped division of responsibilities  is especially discriminatory. A  clause should be developed which  allows for maximum flexibility of  responsibilty and/or joint responsibility.  2) An indirect discrimination results from the absence in the definition of child care expenses  (s63(3) (a) (ii)) of persons studying in full-time institutions.  Under "earned income", there should  be added a provincial or Canada  loan or grant. As well, to s63(3)  (a)(ii) the phrase, "and to persons  engaged in full time study at an  accredited institution" should be  added.  3) The $1000 per child is inadequate  and unrealistic in terms of the present cost of living and cut-back  wages. A person running a business  is entitled to deduct the full a-  mount of expenses. Yet a maximum  is placed on child-care expenses.  Caring for children is a worthy  valuable activity and full recognition of its value should be reflected in tax policy.  4) The child care expense deduction should be from tax payable and  not from taxable income as at present. Babysitting expenses are  approximately the same whether the  parent is at a $5000 a year annual  taxable income level or a $50,000  a year taxable income level. The  lower income person is therefore  paying a higher proportion of income for child care and benefits  least from a deduction from taxable  income. This discriminatory discrepancy should be rectified.  In conclusion, since the described  discrepancy in allowable deduction  for child care expenses between a  single parent man and a single parent woman is so clearly discriminatory, our Association would like  a clear explanation from you as to  why this section is drafted this  way. We would like responses as  well to the four other points  raised.  Will you give your assurances that  this section will be amended to  eliminate discrimination and the  blatantly unfair discrepancies before the budget changes are given  final reading?  We are awaiting your response before proceeding with further analysis of the underlying policy of  this section.  Thanking you in advance for your  prompt attention to this matter,  I am  Yours truly,  Kriss Boggild, Chairperson  Women and Law Association  Articling Student Caucus  cc: Conservative Party  New Democratic Party  Councils on the Status of Women  Other interested groups SOM€ HON. M€MD€RS  Following is a brief report on what the  federal Cabinet Ministers and MPs said  about women's issues during the month  of December 1976. Once again, VSW urges  all members and readers to write to them  about the matters discussed. If you  don't know who your MP is, just ask us.  Cabinet Ministers are addressed as "The  Honourable..., Minister of...". Members of Parliament are addressed as MP.  While Parliament is in session, no postage is necessary. Just put "O.H.M.S."  where ffhe stamp normally goes.  ABORTION  PCN5ION5  On December 9, 1976, MP Whiteway of  Manitoba asked the Minister of National  Health and Welfare if the statement that  "abortion is an acceptable form of birth  control" in the booklet "Teacher's Guide  for Sex Education" recently published  by Lalonde's department is legal.  The Honourable Marc Lalonde said the  booklet dees not say that, and stressed  that the government position has always  been that abortion is not an acceptable  means of birth control.  On December 22, 1976, MP Epp of Manitoba  asked the Prime Minister if the federal  government would introduce amendments  to the Criminal Code in 1977, restricting abortion to cases in which the  mother's life is seriously jeopardized  in view of the fact that "50,000 Canadians lost their lives in 1976 by being  aborted."  Trudeau replied that the Badgely  committee had studied the operation  of abortion laws across Canada and  that its report will be tabled  soon by the Minister of Justice.  Your views on abortion should be  directed immediately and repeatedly to Basford. c.c. to Lalonde and  your own MP.  CQUALWOPK  EMPLOYMENT  On December 2, 1976 MP Aideen Nicholson  of Ontario asked the Minister of Manpower  if he would revise the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations used  by the federal government for civil service jobs.  She criticized the book for  including foster mother and child care  attendant in the same category as tattoo  artist and cabana boy, rating foster parent skills lower than a dog trainer.  The  Honourable Jack Cullen replied that the  book was published in 1971 and would indeed be updated.  On December 6, 1976 Ms. Nicholson charged  that the book reflects male bias in underrating service jobs which are mainly  staffed by women and immigrants.  She  stressed these jobs would have to be reevaluated if the intention of the equal  pay for work of equal value clause in  the newly proposed federal human rights  law is to be met. Mr. Arthur Portelance,  Parliamentary Secretary to Cullen, said  the book would be revised by April 1,  1978 with consideration to foster parent  and childcare jobs.  In the meantime, the Vancouver Sun reports that Manpower has renamed some  1,500 civil service jobs with non-sexist  titles but has not changed its own sexist  name.  (New job titles do not mean re-  evaluation.)  Cullen should be pressed on the matter  until it is concluded.  Send carbons to  Nicholson, Lalonde and your own MP.  On December 7, 1976 MP Knowles of Winnipeg asked the Prime Minister if the  federal government would review all  pension plans under their aegis, in  particular the shortcomings of spouse's  allowance, the non-inclusion of housewives in the CPP, pensions of only 50%  to surviving widows of public servants,  and the denial of pensions in many cases  to veterans' widows.  The Honourable Marc Lalonde, Minister  Responsible for the Status of Women,  replied that a complete review is now  being made of all pension plans private  and public in Canada.  However, he  denied the allegation of discrimination  in pension plans, saying that "It is  merely a matter of dealing differently  with people according to the conditions  in which they find themselves, male or  female.  That has nothing to do with  the status of women as such."  On December 13, 1976 Knowles raised the  issue again.  He said perhaps Lalonde  meant women don't get pension equality  because they are not in the labour market at all or as long as men and therefore do not qualify.  Nevertheless  Knowles argued this is discrimination.  Mr. Paul McRae, Parliamentary Secretary  to Lalonde refuted Knowles' accusations  and explained that the new human rights  legislation if passed would prohibit  discrimination in pensions and fringe  benefits, and that an inter-departmental  committee is reviewing the matter.  Knowles charged McRae with missing  the point.  Lalonde should be pressured on the  issue.  Send carbons to Knowles and  On December 7, 1976 MP Broadbent of Ontario asked the new Minister of Manpower  what he proposed to do about the underemployment of Canadian women. Broadbent  said 23,000 women have dropped out of the  labour force during November, a rate much  higher than that of men. He also noted  that the level of unemployment for heads  of families is almost 50 per cent higher  for women. The Honourable Jack Cullen  argued statistics with him briefly and  then said he is doing all he can within  his limits to create and find jobs for  the unemployed. He did not say what he  is doing specifically for women.  Cullen should be notified that many  Manpower programs are not equally  available to women (remember the  closure of Women's Independence  Necessary and the Manpower Women's  Advocate Sit-in, the fall of '75),  and therefore he must institute  special programs for unemployed women.  ILLG5ITMACY  On December 17, 1976 MP Lavoie of Quebec  moved for leave to introduce Bill C-389  to amend the Interpretation Act to prevent discrimination between illegitimate  and legitimate children.  The motion  was agreed to by the House of Commons,  given first reading and ordered to be  printed.  Write to your MP asking that he/she  support the bill until it is passed and  the reasons why you think illegitimacy  should be abolished.  your own MP.  SCNATOP5  On December 20, 1976 MP Fairweather of  New Brunswick asked the Prime Minister  if he would summon more women from the  11,413,700 women of Canada to the upper  chamber (Senate).  The Right Honourable  Trudeau replied that the number of  women in the last few years who have  been appointed to very high offices in  the courts, to lieutenant governorships and to the Senate is indicative  of the federal government concern for  women.  (MP Hees of Ontario then said  "Pierre is the Earle McLaughlin of  Parliament.")  Mr. Fairweather asked  if six women out of 194 Senate places  is a fair and adequate representation  of the women in Canada.  Trudeau said  it is not sufficient and that "We know  the historical reasons why women have  not been as active in politics as men.  Fortunately, we are beginning to correct  that."  Ask Trudeau for a list of the women  appointed during his administration,  their positions and their names. Press  him to appoint more women.  Send carbons to Fairweather, Lalonde and your  own MP0 The following materials are now, or  soon will be housed in the VSW library  where they are available for reference  five days a week.

Reviewed by Norah Hartman  In Cuban Women Now, Margaret Randall  illustrates through interviews with  Cuban women their view that the roots  of their liberation lay in the radical change at the base of their  society which occurred with the victory of Fidel Castro in 1959.  This book is divided into three parts:  the first is a brief description of  the Cuban women's revolutionary history, the second and major section  consists of interviews with Cuban  women in all aspects of life and the  third is a chronology and glossary  which was of great assistance to this  reader.  Women from areas of life are interviewed: agricultural workers, revolutionaries, ex-domestics, dancers, an  actress now director, ex-prostitutes  and foundry workers, and of all ages.  Each person describes her life before  the revolution and the changes which  it has brought.  Many details of their lives are revealed such as the shopping bag plan  for working mothers, the fact that  some husbands will do laundry, others  won't, how the Children's Circles  became staffed by ex-domestic workers and the details of the extensive  literacy program.  4  Some women described their experiences  during the revolutionary war and how  they achieved respect from men through  their courage and resourcefulness in  violent situations. This respect has  aided women in their liberation from  sexually determined roles in a "macho"  society.  The description by an ex-prostitute  of the efforts to wipe out prostitution were vividly portrayed. She  tells how she was forced into degrading conditions through economic oppression, how this situation was  recognized by the present government,  and how women were removed from  prostitution, educated and given  a purpose in life through employment.  Everyone interviewed emanated great  joy and pride in being able to work,  particularly in the production of  sugar. Moreover, one also learns  through these interviews how the  Central Committee has influenced  every aspect of life. It has produced revolutionary art, theatre  and music.  This was difficult reading for someone unfamiliar with life in Cuba, but  it is valuable as a source of information from the women themselves who  are enthusiastically carrying out  the promises of the revolution.  RAPE by Carol V. Horos  Tobey Publishing Co. Inc.  Box 428, New Canaan, CT. 06840  (1974)   $2.95.  Reviewed by Diana Smith  Rape, to this writer at least, is  the ultimate expression of women's  oppression, whether before, during  or after the act itself.  Of the books currently on the market  dealing with rape, this book I recommend.  For starters. Horos gives a  straight—forward approach to the  crime, its consequences and its prevention.  Other recommended books on the subject give similar information but  all tend to deal with some areas more  extensively than others. For instance  Rape, The First Sourcebook for Women  by the New York Radical Feminists  covers better the political/feminist  issues of rape.  But for practical  information in an easy-to-read form  Horos' book is very useful.  She begins with a short historical  overview, aptly sub-titled 'a painful  perspective'.  For example, biblical  law forced an unmarried rape victim  to marry her rapist with the added  penalty that he could never divorce  his victim. Who, after all, would  want spoiled merchandise?  Following this Horos attempts to dis-  spell several of the myths surrounding  rape. Among these are the old favourites that rape is motivated by uncontrollable sexual urges and performed  by a stranger who leaps out of the  bushes.  Studies in fact show that the  major motive is aggression and often  the victim and rapist are, at least  casual acquaintances.  In studying the rapist, Horos finds  him to appear to have no distinguishing characteristics.  One study found  "...their heterosexual adjustment is  quantitatively well above average."  The particular value in this book is  its heavy focus on the preventative  aspects of rape; precautions to take  whether at home or outside to avoid  assault; and self defense techniques  to use to resist an attack.  Horos then deals with the process involved if a woman is raped and decides  to report to the police.  This includes  the detailed questioning and written  statement; a medical examination, not  only to treat the woman for injury but  to collect evidence should the case go  to court; and the legal procedure if a  man is charged with the assault.  The final chapter gives information on  how to start a rape crisis centre with  a brief list of its functions. Typical  of the whole book, this chapter is  factual and with limited analysis, although any commentary is relevant and  rarely rhetorical.  Like most other books on rape readily  available, this one is written by an  American about the situation in that  country and so the statistics given do  not necessarily reflect what is happening in British Columbia. Nor is the  U.S. Directory of Rape Crisis Centres,  given in the back of the book, too  useful to Canadian readers. However,  rape, like most other areas of women's  oppression, cuts across national borders and makes most of the content  relevant to us also.  This book is one of a series from the  "Women's Library" compiled by The  Centre for Women Policy Studies, a  publishing program of literature useful to women.  A notable feature of  this program is a 70% discount to  groups, organizations and services who  intend to distribute the book free.

OLIVIA RECORDS (Box 70237 Los Angeles  CA 90070) now in its fourth year  as an American national women's -  recording company has produced two  new albums. "Where Would I Be Without You" features the poetry of  Pat Parker and Judy Grahn. Both  celebrate lesbian struggles in  white heterosexual U.S. The other  new record is by BeBe K'Roche, a  four woman band whose music combines  Latin, rhythm and blues, and jazz  elements.
