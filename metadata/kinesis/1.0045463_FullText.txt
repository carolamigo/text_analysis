Dear Santa,  We have worked very hard all year  and there are many things that we  haven't got that we feel we deserve  to have.  Some of our requests may have a familiar ring.

FACT:  Advance cancer kills 60% of  women within 5 years.  FACT:  If cancer detected early  enough less than 10% will  die within 10 years.  FACT: There are breast cancer  screening techniques that  detect the desease at its  earliest stage, reducing  spread of the disease from  70% to 34%.  T:  Dennis Cocke, Minister of  Health, has delayed action on  recommendations by a commi-  tee of B.C. doctors that a  mass screening/early detection program be instituted  because he is not sure whether the program would help  "a significant number of the  people of the Province'to  warrant such an expense".

When the newsletter was laid-out  the main part of ..the article was  inadvertently omitted. Our apologies  and we are now including the  Recommendations (43-50) of the Report  of the Royal Commission on The Status  of Women in Canada pertaining to the  position of women in Crown Corporat-  ions.     _£d>  Crown Corporations are, in very general terms, organizations owned by  the government and entrusted with  a specific task or business endeavor.  Examples include the CBC, Central  Mortage and Housing, the National  Harvest Board, the Economic Council  and many others.  Once again, the minister on the spot  is the Hon. Marc Lelonde.Minister  Responsible for the Status of Women.  Write him at the Parliament Buildings  in Ottawa. .  You can also send copies to Prime  Minister Trudeau, the MP from your  area and the Advisory Council on the  Status of Women (63 Sparks Street,  Box 1541, Station B, Ottawa).  Rec.  43  We recommend that federal Crown  Corporations and agencies (a)  ensure that women scientists  and technologists receive equal  consideration with men for appointment, and (b) make a special effort  to give graduate women employees  , a chance to take post-graduate  degrees.  We recommend that federal Crown  Corporations and agencies (a)  develop transfer and promotion  measures that will encourage  women to move out of the traditionally female occupations  into other occupations,  and (b) emphasize in recruitment programmes that all occupations are open equally to women  and men.  We recommend that each federal  Crown Corporation and agency  devise a long-term plan for the  better use of womanpower within  its organization.  We recommend that, where the  size of staff warrants it, federal Crown Corporations and  agencies appoint one or more  qualified people whose primary  duty for the next five to eight  years will be to provide for the  training and development of  women in their organizations.  We recommend that federal Crown  Corporations and agencies with  rotational programmes between  field and head offices ensure  that women are considered for  rotation on the same basis as  men and are not judged in advance on their freedom to rotate.  We recommend that federal Crown  Corporations and agencies (a)  review their selection procedures  to ensure that women are used  in recruitment and selection  programmes, and (b) have senior  women officers on their personnel  administration staffs.  We recommend that different provisions on the basis of sex be  eliminated from superannuation  and insurance plans for federal  Crown Corporations and agencies.  We recommend that federal Crown  Corporations and agencies (a)  make clear to educational institutions, and to the public, that  career opportunities within their  organizations are open to women  and that they are encouraging  women to prepare themselves for  such careers; and (b) require  each private organization with  which they do business to include in each contract, a clause  that prohibits discrimination  in employment on the basis of  sex.  — Roberta Schlosberg an     equal      partnership  WORKING GROUP ON MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY  Community of Property Proposal  The working group on Matrimonial  Property is proposing a significant  change in the law affecting the property rights of married couples.  While this proposed change to community of property may be seen as a  radical departure from the existing  law of separate property, it is felt  that the notion of community of  property more adequately reflects the  'Ģ way both partners intend their married  life to be ordered by allowing both  of them to participate in the relationship as equals.  Although It is true that such a change  from an existing system of laws based  on separate property to a system in  which property acquired during marriage  is shared poses some difficult technical-legal problems, these technical  questions of implementation and  integration can all be solved without  sacrificing the rights of the spouses  or third parties.  Such systems are  working successfully in other jurisdictions. The real question is whether  it is desirable to have a legal system  of matrimonial property which imposes  serious restrictions on the economic  role of the wife, as does the existing  system of separate property; or  whether the legal system of matrimonial  property should be one which allows  both spouses to participate in and  benefit from their marriage equally.  Some knowledge of the common law  origin of the existing law of separate  property during marriage is necessary  in order to better understand the  implications of the proposed change  to community of property.  Very briefly, prior to the late  1800's there existed in the common  law jurisdictions the fictive notion  of "unity of spouses". What this  meant was that, upon marriage, the  law saw the partners as only one  person, and that person was the  husband. As a result all property  brought into the marriage by the  wife became the property of the husband.  Once wed, a woman had no right  to deal with any property.  She had no right to enter into any  contract. Her husband had absolute ,  right to deal with the property of  the marriage in any way he chose,  including disposing of it.  The inherent unfairness of this system was recognized late in the 19th  century and, in an effort to rectify  the situation, the common law jurisdictions enacted the Married Women's  Property Act. This Act is still the  basic statutory protection of the  right of a married woman to deal with  the property she brings into the  marriage.  It gives the married woman  the right to enter into contracts  and to assume liability to the extent  of her own separate property. Thus  what was created by the Married  Women's Property Act was the system  of "separate property": a system  which acknowledges that both the  husband and the wife bring into the  marriage their own property; a system  which views the property and its  products as the separate property of  each spouse throughout the marriage.  It is a system which considers spouses  to be economic strangers until the  marriage breaks down.  It is this  view of spouses as economic strangers  which has created the morass of laws  which attempt to deal with the resulting extremely inequitable distribution of property on breakdown.  Furthermore, this view creates a  situation in which the wife is forced  to be economically dependent on her  husband not only during marriage, but  after.  It is a view which.does not  seem to consider the contribution  of the spouse who assumes responsibility for the home to be of any "real"  value.  It does not take into account  the fundamental difference between  the economic relationship of persons  doing business as strangers and the  economic relationship of spouses.  It is. this fundamental failure to  recognize the nature of the relationship between husband and wife which  has resulted in a legal system that  forced the Supreme Court of Canada  to come to the horrifyingly unjust  decision in Murdoch v Murdoch.  Operating from the beliefs that:  1 All persons should be equal  under the law.  2 Marriage is a partnership of  shared responsibilities.  3 The roles of economic provider  and homemaker are of equal  value to the relationship.  4 Married women are not economically incompetent.  the Working Group set out to find or  create a system of laws which would  satisfy them all and thereby provide  a structure in which marriage would  be a relationship of equals rather  than a relationship of dependence in  which feelings of superiority and  inferiority cannot often be avoided.  The proposal to change to a full and  immediate community of property system would, generally speaking, have  the following effects:  1 All property brought into the  marriage by the spouses would  remain their separate property.  This is as it is now under the  system of "separate property".  2 All property acquired during  marriage, with the exception of  gifts and inheritance, would be  community property. Under the  system of "separate property"  all property acquired by either  spouse during marriage remains  their separate property.  3 Both spouses would have an equal  right to deal with the community  property independently, with the  exception of real estate and  household goods.  (Dealings involving real estate or household  goods would require the joinder  or consent of both spouses.)  This means that, whereas now a  wife cannot obtain credit in her  own name based on family assets  which are legally "separate", a  wife would be able to obtain  credit in her own name and in her  own right on the basis of the  "community" assets.  4 Upon separation all property  brought into the marriage by  either spouse will be returned  to that spouse, and all property  acquired during marriage will be  divided equally between the  spouses.  Full and immediate community of property with joint management is a  system which acknowledges the equality  of men and women within the institution  of marriage.  It is a system which  allows for equality of responsibility  and independence during marriage. It  is a system which reflects the way  most of us now order our married lives.  And it is a system which provides a  legal framework to support the commonly held intention of happily  married couples that property common  to the marriage (such as the family  car or television set) is "ours"  rather than "mine" or "yours".  Finally, it is a system which, upon  breakdown, divides the community  property on the basis that it was  intended to be, and was in fact  shared equally while the marriage  was good; therefore, it is just and  equitable that that division be made  final when the marriage dissolves.  It is a system which, by making such  a division, recognizes that economic  input is not the only important  contribution to a.marriage, that, in  fact, both spouses contribute to it  equally, in their own ways.  - Gina Quijano  Editor's Note: A transcript of The  Balloon Lady: You And Mrs. Murdoch,  a discussion on married women and  the law, is available to study groups  from the Advisory Council on the  Status of Women, Box 1541 Station B,  Ottawa. The transcript is a discussion presented by the Women's Institute in Manitoba with June Menzies,  vice-chairwoman of the Advisory  Council on the Status of Women, Muriel  Arpin, chairwoman of laws, National  Council of Women of Canada and Jean  Carson, legislative chairwoman,  Provincial Council of Women of Manitoba. etter  embers"     forum  obby  The Letter Lobby Committee feels that  the content of the foregoing article  is of vital importance in the move  towards greater equality for women.  The actual recommendations of the commission have not been made yet, these  are only the statements of the Working  Group on Community Property. We would  like to impress upon several key cabinet members the need for recommendations based upon the working group's  findings.  Province wide support is  necessary on this issue.  Please clip  and send the following letter (or write  it out in your pwn hand) to: Hon. Alex  MacDonald, Atorney General of B.C.,  Hon. Norman Levi, Minister of Human  Resources, Premier David Barrett, and .  your local M.L.A. All can be addressed  c/o Parliament Buildings, Victoria,B.C.  To: Alex MacDonald, Attorney General  Norman Levi, Minister of Human  Resources  Premier David Barrett  I urge you to adopt a system of full  and immediate community of property  with joint management for British  Columbia.  Such a property system  best reflects the true partnership  nature of marriage.  It best implements economic justice between spouses  since both spouses contribute to the  prosperity of a family, though they  may do so in widely different ways.  Adoption of this system of property  would go far to promote the stability  of the family and justice between  spouses.

V6B 1H7  681-7532  THE MISS CANADA PAGEANT  CINDERELLA FOR A YEAR  The recent Miss Canada Pageant (MCP!)  was the epitome of female sex-role  stereotyping.  Contestants were  judged on"beauty, grace, charm, poise,  carriage, sincerity, taste, dignity,  talent and intellect". WOW..  But all these and beauty are in the  eye of the beholder.  I wonder who  picked the judges and who the contestants themselves would pick as  Miss Canada, from their peers.  The Pageant is a classic situation  for women to be in, competing with  one another for the attention of a  common beholder, measuring up to  someone else's standards.  The attention paid to intellect and  talent seemed embarrassingly superficial, a token, a trinket, another  part of the contestant's wardrobe.  The presentations by the 'girls' (as  they were referred to although they,  were all over 16) were painfully  self-conscious, many naive to the  point of obnoxiousness.  But that's  purity and innocence for you.  Accompanying music ,was s.erious to  the point of pretentiousness.  It  seemed like I was watching a corny  high school play or even a halloween  masquerade.  I have heard it likened  to the dying tradition of the 'coming  out' ball.  If these were homosexuals in drag,  people would be laughing or be in a  state of shock. Yet they take the  Miss Canada Pageant seriously! It is  beyond me.  I was torn between  laughter and dismay.  A highlight of the Pageant is the  awarding of the Miss Congeniality  trophy to the one woman who has been  the best sport through it all, probably the one who has been the most  self-effacing of the lot, the ultimate of NICE.  But nice is not  enough.  Eight semi-finalists were chosen  publicly in front of the remaining  non-winners who applauded unques-  tioningly, smiles unfailing.  To me  it was gauche.  They were unable to  express their disappointment in  private during the big moment.  I wished that just one woman had  stopped smiling moronically long  enough to frown, that when they all  clustered around the entertainer  during the break in the show to kiss  him (obviously staged) that just one  had stood back and looked disgusted,  that when Miss Canada (who spoke on  women's rights) was chosen, she  refused the crown, and in front of  millions, right there on Canada, had  given her reasons very succinctly.  And then the runner.up would follow  suit.  I ask you, is a fur coat and a compact  car and a $ 1,000 scholarship really  such a big deal? After it's all over  where is Miss Canada going to wear a  fur coat in the days of endangered  species. A $ 1,000 scholarship won't  take you through a year of college  today.  Training for an executive  job in the field of her choice would  be more appropriate.  Imagine a Mr. Canada Pageant, the  contestants all tall, dark and handsome. What man would introduce himself as the proud representative of  beautiful B.C.?  What man would allow  himself to be paraded down the stage,  not once, but twice in a black lycra  jockstrap, with a banner strategically  draped over appropriately sized bulges.  What man would compete for being the  most suave and debonair, the epitome  of the white knight to match Cinderella? Why do women do it?  Much is made of the "wonderful opportunity" Miss Canada has to travel  and the "fantastic" job of diplomacy  she does for Canada. I thought this  was Trudeau's job. Does she ever  associate with the Prime Minister in  any meaningful way? No, Miss Canada  is powerless, another classic situation for women to be in.  Miss Canada may be a good public  figure (excuse the pun) but the unstated obvious reason for the Pageant  is commercial interest, from the  designer's collections she wears, to  the products she must endorse.  On  radio recently, I heard a previous  Miss Canada state she was paid $ 100  per week (minimum wage!) and her time  was rented out at exorbitant rates  by promoters who get the profits.  Clearly, Miss Canada is exploited.  Someone at Vancouver Status of Women  suggested there be a MS. CANADA  AWARD, to be given to the feminists  of 1975, who achieve the most concrete  and positive changes in the status of  women.  I think this is a very good  idea for an International Women's  Year project. How about it?  - Karen Richardson SOMEIHI  GOING ON AT  THE OFFICE  YOUDONT  KNOW.

After  discussion it was decided to send a  letter to the standing committee of  BCFW affirming VSW's support for a  federation of women as an umbrella  group.  It was reported that there has been  protest from other groups as well as  VSW about the appointment of Marc  Eliesen . (See letters,page ^ this  issue).  It was decided to provide LIP with  an endorsement of Reel Feelings for  a half-hour daily radio program for  six months.  Alice James reported that the new  Federal Action Group is coming along  well. (See report, p.9 this issue).  WORKSHOP ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE  Anyone interested in kid's literature 'Ģ  writing, drawing, reading, historical  point of view, or just plain talking  about the whole field?  If so why not  phone this office and we'll try and  put a group together and see what  "goodies" emerge from our collective  pens.There might be a possibility of  doing an occasional page for Kinesis  or maybe producing a small booklet  ourselves.  Think of that one dubious word TOMBOY  and the infinite cartoon, fiction,  article possibilities that emerge  from just one word. Why not share  some of your ideas?  Contact Heather Kellerhals - 736-3746  WRITER'S WORKSHOP  The writer's group is slowly growing and we remind you again that  anyone is welcome to join the group  at any time.  It is led by CP copy  editor Carmel McDougall who has been  a tremendous help in teaching us how  to clean up our writing style and  develop more technique. Because of  Carmel's shift changes at work we  have to be flexible with meeting  dates so if you are interested in  joining us please call Diana at the  office and ask about the Writer's  Workshop Meeting.  (Look for a creative writing page in January Kinesis)  COMMUNICATION SKILLS  Nine of us are learning specific  communication skills in a workshop  led by Diane Waterman and Sandra  Yasin of the Counselling Department  at UBC.  It has been incredibly effective six week course.  Is there  anyone out there who would be interested in attending another such  course if one were to be scheduled  in the early spring? Call and let  us know.  LETTER LOBBY  John Turner must be going out of his  mind wondering why all these long  letters concerning income tax are  arriving from B.C. daily.  Our Letter Lobby members have been writing  at an unrelenting pace and the message is getting across. Dr. Katie  Cooke wrote to say "this is certainly the kind of support which the Advisory Council on the Status of Women  feels is essential to having a women's  concerns throughout Canada recognized  and acted upon by the Federal Government".  If you are interested in becoming a part of the Letter Lobby  Committee please write or call Diana  Bissell at the office (out of town  members WELCOME) and you will be sent  the basic information package to help  you begin.  Group Co-ordinator, Dorothy Holmes, keeps in close touch with  all writers who want some help in putting letters together.  You might be interested to know that  in a recent House of Commons debate,  local M.P. Stu Leggatt really took  Justice Minister Otto Lang to task  for his personal prejudices concerning abortion, and for his efforts  to cut off funding to women's groups  doing abortion referrals. We immediately wrote Mr. Leggatt supporting  his stand and sent off'yet another  letter to Mr. Lang saying you-know-  what. It seems that Leggatt is determined to keep the abortion issue  in front of Parliament, why don't  you drop him a line urging him on?  (Mr. S. Leggatt, M.P., House of  Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.)  MEDIA ACTION  Seen any bad ads lately? Please  send them into Nadine Allen at the  office and she will make sure that  the worst ones are printed in Kinesis.  HAVE YOU THE TIME?

BOOK  REVIEW  COUNSEL FOR THE DAMNED  Arrogant, pompous, egotistical  and basically illiterate, Neil  Fleishman's Counsel For The Damned  could equally well be titled Memoirs  Of A Male Chauvinist Pig.  Page after  page of awkward, self-laudatory reminiscence, contrived dialogue, and  situations warped to present woman  in the light of a totally incompetent  subspecies, do not make a book.  Counsel For The Damned is essentially  autobiography, if gratuitous opinion  is acceptable as a self-portrait.  Fleishman's universal truth appears  to spring directly from the genitals:  "It all ends up behind that bedroom  door.  If a man cannot make it in bed  with her, if he's nothing more than  a deadbeat flogging the mattress, then  no- really free woman will ever accede  to any reconciliation with him. When  a woman learns what her rights are,  she will put the blame where it belongs.  There is no substitute for craftsmanship - no substitute for a large cock  and the knowledge of how to use it  expertly."  The book is written in a strange variety  of styles, as though Fleishman had  engaged a number of ghost writers and  fallen out with them one after another,  But through it all there is this appalling ego, somewhere between Mike Hammer  and Dostoevsky. Women are castigated  for "never having the decency or guts  or wholesomeness to have children/'  He recommends "good healthy whoredom"  as a means of paying for a divorce,  (and incidently as a means of "paying  their lawyer properly") - "most women  don't have the guts to do in public  and illegally what they have been  doing legally in the privacy of their  own homes throughout the years of their  marriage."  Braggadocio and bombast are old-  fashioned words in 1973.  But Counsel  For The Damned is an old-fashioned  book.  "One more peep out of you," says  Fleishman to a six foot client. And  "I wait, puffing on my cigar, glancing  through a Kelmscott Chaucer reprint.  A curl of smoke tangles my cavalry  moustache " Almost the only fiction lawyer cliche missing from the  book is "three fingers of bourbon from  the bottom drawer of my desk...."  Fleishman's clients alJL have "twin  thoracic protuberances" or they are  "striking blondes/' "She is so well  endowed that I s^are at her in mute  astonishment..."'ñ†  There are, in North America, a number  of organizations known as "Vanity  Presses", through whose offices, and  for quite a lot of money, anybody can  get a book published.  Review copies  are sent to book editors, who usually  dump them into the trashcan, and the  remainder sent to the author for having around the house, in case friends  drop in.  They are usually written by  retired prairie wheat farmers, or  registered nurses, and called Twenty-  five Years of Wheat or High White  Beds.  They are invariably dull,  introspective, and singularly  lacking in either excitment or  enlightenment.  J.J. Douglas is  not a vanity publisher, even  though Fleishman's book, seen as  a sole example of their choice,  could easily give that impression. "Lengthy conversations are  offered as verbatim, and there  is a strange recurrence of gauche  prose which appears to have been  carefully stored in the author's  memory againct the day when he  would write this book.  "Whatever  it is that had lain dormant in  her erupts as if activated by  some diabolical catalyst...."  Fleishman invents names, like  John Toonerville, and then invents jokes to go with the names,  offering the complete package as  further evidence of his sparkling  wit.  "Your names John Toonerville?  You look to me like you're a little  off your trolley, but I guess that  completely escapes you, doesn't it?"  In one supposedly factual account  of a well known bank robbery, Fleishman changes the name of the convicted  criminal, unfortunately choosing a  name which has overtones of racial  discrimination, and then again proceeds to misquote the trial judge's  sentencing remarks as verbatim, even  though, by his later admission, he  had nothing to do with this case  until some eight years later. At  this time he was introduced to the  woman involved by a well known Vancouver human interest journalist,  Simma Holt, who for some strange  reason he chooses to thinly disguise  as Linda Hunt.  Like most male chauvinists, Fleishman's final romanticism is Mom and  apple pie.  The last two pages of  the book are a two page "Valedictory"  - an old lady, a Bible, and much  talk of love.  The dust jacket says that Fleishman's  partner calls him the Wizard; his  opponents and some of his clients are  more likely to refer to "that sonofa-  bitch Fleishman." I think that's a  little mild.  - James Barber  PWA  rehiring  pregnant  stewardesses.  (just beating  the stork!) ... CONFERENCE FAILURE ...  'WOMEN TO-DAY IN NOVA SCOTIA'  I recently attended (as a delegate  from Halifax and as a workshop  leader) the weekend conference on  Women Today in Nova Scotia (Our  Potential, Opportunities, Priorities).  It was a failure, in a very important  way.  It was demoralizing and alienating, when it should have been  inspiring and unitive.  I think that it could be constructive  to share my thoughts on this conference, since failure was built into  the structure of the conference.  We can avoid the same mistakes in  planning future conferences.  Throughout the conference, delegates  were treated as less than mature,  responsible adults. We were led,  herded, protected, and patronized.  We_were told that we could 'dress as  it pleases you' for the banquet.  As  if we needed to be told!  Although  the panel discussion was open to the  public, the questions were cut off  after 20 minutes because it was  10:30. We had to insist on microphones being set up for this question  period.  I guess the important people  on the panel didn't have to hear what  we ordinary people thought.  The  conference programme was vague and  changeable, so that we never knew  what was really going to happen next,  and we had to put up with officials  interrupting our workshops with  announcements, on a PA system.  The structure of the conference was  unnecessarily complex.  On Saturday  we each attended four workshops.  The  pace was so fast that we were late  for at least two of them, and we were  all exhausted by the end of the day.  The activities were held in two separate buildings which had a steep and  slippery hill between them.  There  was a 'Recommendations Committee' and  a 'Post Conference Planning Session'.  We didn't know who was involved, or  what they were going to do.  Thejtone of the entire conference was  anti-feminist.  One panelist spoke of  the issues that are important to  'aware' women today.  That panelist  was a man.  Another panelist said that  she wishes she were a minister's wife,  and not a minister. Although men were  not allowed at the conference, almost  half of the workshop leaders were  men - 14 men and 33 women'.  In some  cases there were women who worked with  those men, and could have led the  workshop (sitting silently in the  workshop).  There were no workshops  on rape, abortion, sexism in schools,  the image of women in the media,  socialization, marriage, non-sexist  child-raising, the politics of house  work. . .Consciousness Raising and  Family Planning were added at the last  minute.  There was no day care provided.  Women were prevented from getting to  know one another on an equal, sharing  sort of way. We had neither the place  nor the opportunity to talk with each  other.  It was intended that the workshops be tightly controlled.  The  workshop leaders were instructed to  talk for five minutes each, to field  questions, and to record two recommendations (on a form provided) - all in  one to one and a half hours.  The conference was obviously organized by and for women who believe  that we have never been discriminated  against or that we can get whatever  we want if we are polite/aggressive  enough.  It was designed for women  who 'would rather be a woman than a  person', who 'didn't come here to  listen to women', who scoff at the  title 'Ms.', who react violently to  women wearing cover-alls.  It was not a conference for feminists.  We were outsiders, intruders.  The conference cost at least $ 20,000.  There were approximately 300 delegates.  The four maritime provinces  have been granted $ 40*,000 of the  $ 1 million IWY money for women's  projects. That's 4%   - Sandra Arthurs  IWY'75  On the weekend of October 19th-20th,  the Office of the Secretary of State  brought representatives of over eighty  women's groups to Ottawa for the unveiling of the government's plans  for International Women's Year.  The Facts  1)B.C. and the Yukon will be getting  $80,000 in grant monies for the period  extending from now until the end of  March 1975. An additional $80,000  will be rendered to cover the time,  period April to December 1975. This  money comes from the office of the  Secretary of State.  2) Additional funds will be made  available for cultural activities,  advertising promotion , a young  woman's programme and administration  expenses - all from the Office of  the Secretary of State.  3) No grant application for more than  $25,000 will be considered.  4) The Office of the Secretary of  State will be spending a total of  $2,500,000 on IWY.  5) The Secretariat for the International Women's Year - which is  distinct from the Secretary of State-  have an additional $2.5 million.  They propose to spend the money in  the following manner:  $500,000 - on a three month long  advertising campaign designed by an  almost exclusive male advertising  team.  $1,000,000 - on five regional  conferences aimed at involving the  uninvolved in some undisclosed manner.  $1,000,000 - in a manner which  has not been explained although delegates took pains to elicit this information.  6) Manpower is getting no additional  funds.  7) Sue Findlay the innovator of the  Women's Programme for the Secretary  of State faced the loss of her job.  A competition for her job was held  and she lost.  The Feelings For IWY  1) There was controversy about the  inequitable distribution of grant  money which saw-some strange inequities such as that of B.C. -  Yukon getting more money in grants  than Quebec which has a much larger  population.  2) Delegates felt funds were insufficient as well as poorly distributed.  3) The consensus was for something  lasting to be achieved in IWY, for  the focus to be on long term needs.  4) Delegates placed prime emphasis  on legislative change.  5) Real concern was registered  over the "letting go" of Sue  Findlay at a crucial time in the  planning for IWY, a concern expressed  in a joint telegram sent to the  powers that be.  6) While recognizing the importance  of social service* there was a marked  preference for focussing on actions  leading to political change.  7) Delegates were aghast at the ways  in which secretariat proposes to  spend their $2,500,000 and expressed  themselves in no uncertain terms.  8) The suggestion was made that the  conference which had been billed  as a "consultation" did not truly  conform to that definition.  Rather  we were informed of what was to take  place with limited powers to influence those happenings.  -Roberta Schlosberg In the VSW Executive Meeting report  in the November issue of Kinesis, it  was announced that Roberta Schlosberg,  president, had sent a letter to the  provincial government protesting the  appointment of a male, Marc Elieson,  as IWY'75 representative.  Mr. Eliesen  responded to the letter and a flourishing correspondence has grown up."  The letters are reprinted below.  First, Mr. Eliesen's response to the  initial letter of protest.  September 30,1974  Dear Ms. Schlosberg:  The Premier has asked me to reply to  your letter of September 25, regarding International Women's Year in  British Columbia.  Allow me to clarify my particular  role with regard to this subject  matter.  The Office of the Planning Advisor  to Cabinet is a recently created  central policy and planning unit,  which will attempt to co-ordinate  various activities between line  departments and government agencies.  The Office will also attempt to advise and support Cabinet on overall  planning and priority matters, as  determined by the Premier and the  Cabinet.  One of the specific responsibilities  of my office is to deal with matters  related to federal-provincial and  intergovernmental affairs.  In that  regard, my staff and I assist the  Premier and Cabinet in policy  analysis and co-ordination regarding  arrangements and agreements between  provincial governments and the federal  government - as well as any matters  dealing with International implications.  In addition, we advise on  administrative arrangements and we  participate in the planning and organizing of conferences and ministerial meetings between the Prov .ce  and other levels of governr..;nt.  Since International Woman's Year is a  matter related to the United Nations  and involves federal and provincial  discussions and consultation, this  clearly involves my office and our  participation and involvement.  You should be aware, however, that  some time ago Ms. Kathleen Ruff,  Director of the Human Rights Branch  of the Department of Labour, was  officially designated by the Province  as the person to represent the Province of British Columbia at all national and international meetings  related to International Women's Year.  Ms. Ruff and my office - as a central  co-ordinating body - have been in  contact, and we will be working together in this area.  I hope the above clarifies any misunderstandings you may have had  regarding my participation in this  area.  I must say quite frankly, though,  that your letter disturbs me personally, since it goes counter-against  the entire philosophy of the United  Nations' International Women's Year.  As many others havd expressed, there  is a justifiable concern that governments will treat U.N. International  Women's Year lightly as if it is  "just a ladies' meeting". No doubt  you should be aware, if you are not  already, that United Nationa officials  are urging various governments to  ensure that men are also involved in  planning related to this Year, and  are represented in conferences and  meetings, personal involvement being  one of the better processes of learning and understanding.  I believe  it is a credit to this Government  that they have chosen not to treat  this event lightly, by referring it  to the central planning office w&ich  has to deal with priority items•  I would be pleased to meet you and  discuss this matter more extensively.  If you have any additional questions  or concerns, or, to repeat the Premier's request - any suggestions for  United Nations' International Women's  Year— please get in contact with me.  Yours very truly,  Marc Eliesen  Planning Advisor to Cabinet  dialogue  To which Ms. Schlosberg replied.  October 16, 1974.  Marc Eliesen,  Planning Advisor to Cabinet,  Parliament"Buildings,  Victoria, B.C., V8V 1X4  Dear Sir:  Thank you for taking the time to  clarify the role of your office in  International Women's Year.  Clearly, International Women's Year calls  for liaison between the various levels of government, and if your office has been charged with the responsibility, International Women's  Year does demand your participation.  What is not clear, however, is what  implications International Women's  Year has for this Province.  Presumably, this government is not  going to participate in International Women's Year purely on the  national and international levels.  We look to this Province to initiate some activities of its own.  My original letter sought information about what these activities  would be. Two months later I still  don't know.  For this reason I welcome a meeting to exchange information. Please let me know the  prospective date well in advance so  that I can arrange child care.  The fact that this government is not  treating International Women's Year  lightly pleases us. Nevertheless,  we do have two major concerns:  1) That International Women's Year  will be lost in the. shuffle as  just a minor concern in an office which is already invested  with so much responsibility,  2) That "to co-ordinate various  activities between line departments and government n^  agencies" is one task, but  to stimulate and encourage  these activities is quite another. For these reasons, we would  like to press for the appointment  of a woman, selected in consultation with B.C. Women's groups, to  assume these responsibilities.  Kathleen Ruff makes an ideal representative but is too overworked and  underbudgeted to take on this task  also.  I welcome the participation of men  in International Women's Year although admittedly encouraging this  participation does not rank as a  high priority item with me. However, there is a difference between  participation and dictation. The  purpose of International Women:'s  Year as I understand it to highlight  the achievements of women, a purpose  which is not achieveddby letting men  "run the show". After all, if women  can't be trusted to run their own  "showV what have we really achieved?  The idea that men must be involved  in International Women's Year to give  it any real validity or legitimacy is  objectionable.  If governments treat  International Women's Year lightly ■•  because the majority of participants  are female, this response provides  a graphic illustration of the real  status of women, a status that belies  the United Nations rhetoric about  striving for equality, one of the  three goals set forth for Interna*-'  tional Women's Year. Women will take  note of a philosophy that dismisses  their year as "just a ladies meeting", a philosophy that attaches all  kinds of pejorative connotations to  ladies meetings.  Our goal is to see "ladies meetings"  taken just as seriously as those of  "gentlemen". Otherwise, International Women's Year may be "just a ladies  meeting" but it will be our "ladies meeting".  Give us a chance  to do our own orchestration.  Sincerely,  Roberta Schlosberg,  President  cc. Rosemary Brown  Kathleen Ruff  •Here is Mr. Elieson's reply. He  tacitly rescinds his offer of a meeting and fails to comment on a single  point raised in Ms.Schlosberg's letter.  Ms. Roberta Schlosberg,  President,  Vancouver Status of Women,  2029 West 4th Avenue,  Vancouver, B.C.  Dear Ms. Schlosberg:  Thank you for your letter of October 16th regarding International  Women's Year.  You will, no doubt, have received  by now the letter of October 16th  from Kathleen Ruff regarding this  subject-matter.  I hope you will be able to communicate to her any suggestions that  the Vancouver Status of Women may  have on Government activities in  this area.  Yours very truly,  Marc Eliesen,  Planning Advisor to fiabinet  cc Ms. Kathleen Ruff  Mr. John Wood        <■ IO  "Its a pretty good deal for you women  working here at the canal," said the  guy with the orange hard hat.  "What-  daya make? Three, four dollars an  hour? Nothing wrong with that for  a woman!"  I told the orange hard hat that I  was making $6.95 an hour.  "Seven bucks an hour,"he gasped.  " You  mean you make the same as I do?!"  ************  This past summer I was a construction worker on the multi-million  dollar Kootenay Canal Development.  I was the first female to be hired  on the job site to do anything other  than office work.  Shortly afterward,  two other women were hired -Claudette  Burton and Gayle Peppard.  The three  of us worked as junior lab technicians  on the massive hydro-electric project  which is located in the West Kootenays  between the towns of Nelson and Castle-  gar.  Basically my job involved testing  concrete, testing the stuff that goes  into concrete and testing the stuff  . that is made out of concrete.  I was  employed by B.C. Hydro.  The Kootenay Canal Development is a heavy  duty construction project which has  employed well over 1,000 men during  the first two years of its three year  operation. Most of these men are professional construction workers who  have followed British Columbia's hydroelectric projects - such as those  at the Peace River and Mica Creek -  for several years.  Since we were the first three women  to appear on such a job site, we  turned a few heads around, to say  the least.  It was an interesting  experience and one which shed a  lot of light on how a female can fit  into the predominantly male world of  the construction worker.  I discovered that people earn good salaries in  construction, that there is, in most  cases, no good reason why the people  drawing that big money can't be women,  and- that the male construction worker -  welcomes a woman on the job. Mind  you, some men, like my friend with  the orange hard hat, frit perhaps a  bit threatened by the iav_t that we.  made as much money as them. And  some men insisted on whistling and  shouting at us as a means of communication.  But for the most part, I  think the men felt it was a change  that was long overdue. After all  it is a rather unnatural environment  that dictates that men work only with  other men.  Getting Hired  When I went job hunting this spring  I wanted a good paying job. My husband and I were setting up a homestead on a 133-acre piece of property  we own with some other people. The  plan was for me to work while Stan  built us a log house. Construction  jobs are by far the best paying jobs  in this area so that is where I  applied.  ************  My application form: "I am strong  and healthy, used to doing pretty  heavy work, and accustomed to working  in o situatibn dominated by men (I  used to be a newspaper reporter).  I am also interested in learning  about the business of constructing  a major power project."  ***********  The men who do the hiring at the  canal say that they are Vall.'for"  hiring women to do any jobs they  are capable of.  The problem is  that all jobs on such projects, with  the exception of managerial positions,  are unionized. And if there is a "  man on the union's list available  for work, he gets hired before the  new applications are considered.  New applications were being considered for four positions in the B.C.  Hydro lab this spring.  Since three  of these were filled by women, it  seems to be just a matter of applying at the right time and convincing  them you can do it.  I should point  out that there were several men who  applied for the lab jobs as well.  Doing It  Male office worker visiting the lab:  "Look at the way she tears the mold  off that concrete! Boy, I bet your  husband is afraid to get into a row  with you!"  ***********  It seems to be a common fallacy that  construction workers are muscle, -bound  creatures who throw steel girders  around all day.  In actual fact there  are millions of dollars worth of  heavy equipment to do things like  that, and the most exercise a lot of  construction workers get is walking  to and from the lunch room!  Granted  there are jobs where you have to be  fairly strong.  But there are a whole  spectrum of jobs where no more than  average strength is required - surveyors, inspectors, teamsters, some  operating engineers' jobs,etc.  My job involved a lot of lifting,  shovelling and digging, but nothing  that I couldn't handle.  On the few  occasions when I came up against  something that was too heavy for me,  I didn't feel badly about letting  one of the men do it.  If it had  happened every day, I probably would  have quit.  I was never out to prove  that I'm as strong as any man.  I was  very conscious of maintaining my end  of the work load, however.  I know  there were times when I refused help  or didn't ask for it becasue I felt  it necessary to prove that I could  do it.  Construction jobs seem to c;.../y a  built-in boredom factor.  Crossword  puzzles are sacred - to find someone  had already done the crossword in  the only copy of today's paper is  grounds for homicide.  Once the novelty of the new job wore  off and I was programmed to do what  I was.supposed to do, it was day after day of boredom.  I found I was  more dependent on the people I worked  with for stimulous than I had been  on any job before.  Conversation at  coffee breaks and lunchtime became  very important.  It occurred to me one hot August afternoon that some females probably  thought that I was crazy to want such  a job.  I came from the batchplant  THE FEMALE  CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  (where they make batches of concrete)  into the B.C. Hydro office with straggly  hair, a sweaty T-shirt, muddy jeans  and muddy boots that felt hot and  soggy inside.  The girls in the office  were moving around in the cool of the  air-conditioning in pant suits and  sandals.  It was hardly the time to  tell them they should break out of  the traditional female role of the  secretary and take up their shovels!  Fitting In  Lab technician: "Itve worked on construction for 11 years in different  parts of Canada and I've always wondered how come women didn't get into  it. This is the first time I've seen  women on a job and I think it's about  time."  Teamster:  "How's my little sweetie?  Got a kiss for me today?"  ***********  It was the feeling of some administration people that the female  presence on the job would "clean up  the boys' act".  The lab walls were  plastered with Playboy and Penthouse  cut-outs when I started working there.  These didn't embarrass me, nor did  *~Herstory'75  Saskatchewan Women's  Collective  I follow the suggestion of some that  I put up Playgirl photos of Burt  Reynolds.  But after several months  of looking at those cutesy photos  of naked women, Claudette and I one  day decided we needed a change.  So  we tore them down and put some pictures of an old cabin and a stream  and seme trees. Hardly anyone noticed,  much less complained, which made me  wonder how much the pictures were  looked at and how much they Were put  up because that's the type of behaviour expected in an all-male domain.  I think the female presence did a  lot to humanize the working situation at the canal.  The "average construction worker" is usually depicted  as a hard-working, hard drinking male  who thinks of nothing except his pay  cheque and who is buying the beer  after work.  Because of this image,  a man with any tendencies toward  sensitivity or thoughtfulness might  well feel compelled to hide this  side of himself, especially from his  fellow workers.  But with a woman,  they were more inclined to show these  feelings.  It really felt good to  discover a warm, sensitive person  under the rough exterior some men  presented initially. And I enjoyed  the camaraderie with the men on the  job. With just about everybody, there  was some way of relating, some spot  you could touch that would spark a  conservation. Of course, there were  the ones whose only communication  consisted of whistles and shouts.  We occasionally got tickets to eat  at either of the two man camp cafeterias which are set up to feed the -  men who live in trailers on the job  site.  This was always a nerve-testing experience with men gaping, shouting obscenities and pounding the  tables when a female walked in. And  once, after one of us had been doing  some work down at the powerhouse which  is where there was the greatest concentration of workers, a boss from  the powerhouse called our boss to  tell him not to send a woman down v;  there again because he lost $500  each time in general work stoppage.  It seems to me that men who stop work  to shout and gape at a female need  more exposure to women on the job  site so they can learn to share a  working space in a more civilized way.  And Would You Do It Again?  I was laid off on October 4, after  working six and a half months at the  canal.  It was generally a very positive experience and I would definitely do that type of thing again.  I have discovered that construction  is a field that will open up to women  and a field where women can feel  confortable.  Another door is open to you, ladies.  — Linda Oglov 12  the great  toilet  war  OR  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHATCS GOING  ON AT LORNEX MINES?  Recently Dr. Bonnie Buckwa, a chemist,  laid a complaint under the Human  Rights Act against Lornex Mines, charging that they did not extend to women  the same terms or conditions of employment that they did to men. Men  were provided with accomodation and  meals at the mine site, but Dr. Buckwa  had to find her own, at her own expense, in a town some sixty miles  away. Lornex was found to be in contravention of the Act, was ordered  to pay Dr. Buckwa compensation, and  to"make camp accomodation available  to female employees on the same terms  and conditions as male employees."  It looks like a victory, right? So  another woman, Jean Tharpe, applied  for accomodation and quickly found  out the difference between the intent  of the law and thw spirit with which  the company decided to enforce it.  Ms Tharpe was placed in a bunkhouse  with 18 men, sharing a common bathroom that contained four toilet stalls,  four shower stalls, urinals and washbasins.  She wanted equality, and  baby, she was going to get it, even  though there were empty trailers on  the camp site that could have been  used, even though the situation the  company created inconvenienced all  employees.  Then began the war of the toilets.  It was discovered that health regulations governing industrial camps  state tgat if there is more than one  toilet in a room that room vannot be  shafed by both sexes. The company  countdred with another regulation  that states if there is only one  toilet and one shower in a room that  can be locked, and that room is shared by seven or less employees, the  employees can be of both sexes.  The  next move - divide the bathroom in  half, rip out half the toilwts, sho—  ers and washbasins, put locks on the  doors, and reduce the numbers of  occupants in the bunkhouse to fourteen, one of whom was to be Ms Tharpe.  This was potentially even more inconvenient for the employees, and was  well on the way to accelerating dissatisfaction.  It's an old employer  tactic - pitting one group of workers  against another.  In this case, by  attempting to create hostilities between menaand women the company was  clearly trying to show that it was  impossible for both sexes to work u  under the same terms or conditions  of employment.  The union involved,  the United Steel Workers, protested  this action to the company and the  press.  The B.C. Federation of Labour  protested to the company and to the  Minister of Labour, since it was an  order from his department that was  being mocked.  The last word was that the company  has decided to make one end of the  bunkhouse for women only - a simple,  fair, and obvious solution.  One wo  wonders why it took so long.  The moral: if a company doesn't want  to extend equality to women it will  go to considerable lengths to attempt  to make it impossible, government  orders or not, and that one of the  most effective forces for change in  this area is the collective action  of men and women workers.  -Gene Errington  subscribe!

In his speech at the NDP meeting in  Kamloops August 31, Premier Barrett  announced a survey of the status of  women aged between 50 and 60 years,  under the department of Human Resources  headed by Norman Levi.  The aim of the  study would be to find answers to the  questions: Who are they? Where are  they? What are their economic and  social needs?  When Rosemary Brown recently returned  from Sweden, she brought back a survey  conducted in 1962 entitled: "Single,  widowed and divorced women (with no  dependents) in Stockholm, aged 50-66."  The survey was made by a team drawn  from the committee of the status of  women (part of the city's administration) and the bureau of statistics.  I  translated the parts that I found most  interesting but a further evaluation  might follow when we have the B.C.  report to compare with.  In comparing  the facts and figures that follow  below, we have to keep in mind that  this waa the state twelve years ago  and various conditions might have  changed since then. On the other hand,  I find it incredible that this research  was done when the rest of 'the Western  world, and especially the rest of  Europe, did not even dream about spending a thought, let alone money, on  women's matters.  "One of the reasons for conducting this  survey," says the introduction,"was  the fact that these women are the  biggest group dependent on public financial help. Another reason is the  fact that elderly people, and especially women, find it extremely difficult to get suitable jobs." (Note that  when the mincome age was lowered in  B.C. from 65 to 60 there was a dis-  proportionally high increase of women  applying for its bendfits.) "The aim  of this survey is to find out the  actual situation of the single, widowed and divorced women( I shall refer  to the whole group from here on as  'single') in order to take the appropriate measures to improve it, especially in the work situation.  The  city might have to change its policy,  allow more possibilities for continuing education, training and so forth.  In the survey special emphasis was  put on the living conditions, work,  health, education, edonomic conditions and social contacts. Attention  has been given to the women who have  stayed home all their lives taking  care of their parents.  It is believed  they should get financial compensation  for their work (i.e. by employing  them officially for the work by the  government).  The findings of the  survey are usually classified in age  groups - 50-54, 55-59,60-66 - and  status - single, divorced, widowed.  It is interesting to note that in the  age group 50-66 in Stockholm the relation men-women is just a little  over 1 and 3 and that 20,281 women  were single (12,727 men), 9848 women  divorced (6077 men), 14349 women widowed (2882 men).  The survey was done in the spring of  1962 with the help of the available  statistics and 1000 interviews in  which the lower income class is relatively overrepresented. Below are  short summaries of the findings.  Choosing the selections was very difficult indeed and if anybody is interested in further details please contact  me through Kinesis.  WOMEN IN  SWEDEN  A SURVEY OF WOMEN BETWEEN  50 AND 66 IN STOCKHOLM  1) HOUSING AND LIVING CONDITIONS  More than half of the women are  living by themselves, more widows  live alone followed by the singles,  then by the divorced women. About  10% are living alone but rent out  rooms to other people, only 2% of  this group are renting rooms themselves.  Four % live common law and 20% live  with parents or children.  The rest  live with various other relatives.  More than 70% of the women live^in  rented apartments ( but one should  consider that in Europe there are  hardly any private homes in the cities),  9% live in condominiums and only 3%  own their own house.  The rest live  with relatives, employers,etc. Most  lof the apartments have kitchens.  Most of the younger group have bathrooms (least of all the widow group).  The standard in general is only very  slightly below the average in Stockholm.  2) WORK SITUATION  About 3/4 of the women were employed  with comparatively more unmarried  women earning their own living. Next  came the divorced followed by the  widowed women.  Of the 15 kinds of  work which account for all work done  by the women of this survey, the three  biggest groups were: 1) clerks and  shop assistants, 2) cleaning ladies,  3) domestic servants and baby sitters.  Only about 5% of the interviewed  women are in so-called higher qualified positions (either by schooling,  long experience, etc).  In absolute  numbers this would be 2100-2200 whereas the total of qualified jobs in  Stockholm is 80,000 (61,000 occupied  by men, 19,000 by women).  26.4% of  all the working men are in the highest  qualified positions as compared to  11.8% of the working women.  If we  narrow it down to women between 50  and 66 we only find 6.5% in these  positions (compared to all women working in this group).  This shows that  single women are overrepresented in  domestic servant and cleaning positions.  But it was also shown, that these women as a whole performed for more  than 10 years the same work.  Even  the working widows had worked an average of more than 20 years. This shows  that we are dealing with considerable  amounts of time which should be remembered when setting up programs for reactivating women of 50 years of age  and up for work, schooling,etc.  Approximately 8% of the women in this  survey worked(for no financial compensation ) for other people, mostly  their children, and those were mostly  women who had formerly been married.  About 1800 or 4% of all women in this  age group dedicate some or all of their  time to the care of older and sick  people,1000 of them their own parents.  13  There are about the same number of  working women as not working who are  doing unpaid household and nursing  work.  Women not working at the time of the  survey were asked if they would be  interested in working.  Twenty-seven  percent would have liked to go to  work, 78% of them would have preferred  parttime work. Most of the women who  did not intend to work gave health  problems for the reason.  Twelve percent did not think they needed to work  or thought they were busy enough with  their daily homework. Of the women  presently not working, these desired  full time employment: 27% of women  between 50 and 54, 12.1 % between 55  and 59, and 16.3% between 60 and 66.  More widows were interested in working  than divorced women.  The methods most  chose when looking for work were:  1) answering want ads, 2) going personally to employers, 3) through job  agencies.  3) EDUCATION  Seventy-five percent of the women had  only a minimum school education.  Only  3% would have qualified for university  (note: the school system is different  and there are somewhat stricter qualifications required if you want to go  to university).  Only 35% had an actual  training for their work in schools  or by apprenticeships.  Of the unmarried group about half had training, with  22% having training of more than one  year. Approximately 1/3 of the women  would welcome possibilities for job  training and further education.  A most interesting fact was the few  women with a university level education were mostly in the oldest age  group, and that about twice as many  were divorced (4.9% as compared to  single,2.7%, and widowed,2%).  The question was asked:if the women  knew about the training programs already available in the city,(free  classes,  available under certain conditions, even for women in the highest  age..group).  Only about 1/3 were informed about the possibilities, the  others were completely unaware of it.  The divorced women were the best informed group.  When asked what kind of training they  would want, most were interested in  office or nursing jobs.  Though this  is not necessarily what they really  wanted since most of them were unaware if the range of possibilities  open to them.  4)THE NEED OF SOCIAL CONTACT AND ADVICE  One-fifth of the interviewed women  would like more social contacts, with  the least desire among the unmarried  women and the strongest with the  divorced ones. About 1/5 belong to  some kind of club, 85% thought a  counselling service for single women  was necessary, and about 45% said  they would make use of it.  The next chapter took a very detailed  look into the economic situation.  Since the information is relatively  old, I'd rather not go into details  but I just want to mention that Sweden  has probably the best developed system  of social assistance in the Western  world, as well as probably the highest taxes.  MORE.... WOMEN IN SWEDEN (CONT'D),  5)HEALTH  About 2/3 of the women are fully able  to perform work without any physical  limitations, 22% only partially, and  11% are not able to work at all.  The  breakdown is:  family  unmarried  divorced  widowed  fully  fit  72.9%  57.3%  63.7%  partially  17.9%  27.4%  26.4%  not fit  |  8.7%  15.3%  9.8%  Ninety percent of all the healthy  group are working.  Ten percent of  the not fit group and 60% of the  partially fit women are working.  The reasons for wanting to work were:  l)need the money  2)like contact with other people  3)like to work.  (This reason was  especially given by women who were  not considered to be in good enough  health).  The reasons for not wanting to work  were:  1)1 am sick, I don't have the energy  (15% of the healthy group made this  statement)  2) I do not need it financially.  3)1 am busy enough at home.  SUMMARY  About 2/3 of the women between 50  and 66 years of age are living by  themselves, their housing standard  is relatively good, the amount of  space per person was slightly above  the average in Stockholm.  Three-  quarters of the women support themselves by working. Almost all the  women had gone to work at some point  in their lives.  The average income was relatively low*  the widows being in the best financial  position, next the unmarried ones.The  worst situation was found with divorced  women.  These are some of the facts that I  found in the report.  I leave it to  you to draw some conclusions.  It was  interesting to actually see figures  and facts which one usually just has  a feeling might be right (like the  situation of divorced women, education,  etc).  It would be interesting to see  whether another report is planned in  Stockholm and compare the figures.  But in the meantime lets look forward  to what's happening here and now.  —•Viviane Hotz  Do you have small children? Do you  ever wonder, in the precious few  minutes you have to wonder in, if  there isn't somewhere an answer to  the "stay home?" "day care?" "see  if Grandmother is free?" "babysitter?"  dilemma?  Lisa Samuel Newman found a very work-*  able answer during the fifteen months  she and her husband and baby daughter  spent on a kibbutz in Israel. After  watching both her daughter and herself  grow as people she asks "Why do we  not recognize the need for mothers  and children to develop separately  as human beings as part of their waking hours? Why do we perpetuate the  myth that every woman has a twenty-  four-hour-a-day job as a housewife  and mother? That attitude belongs to  an era when housework was done by  hand, when adults and children were  not as mobile as they are now and  kept close to home."  In her article Why Are We Canadians  So Hard On Young Mothers? in the  November issue of Chatelaine , Ms.  Newman, now living in North Vancouver,  B.C., offers some suggestions for  "brightening the lot of the young  mother " while offering her child "a  chance to grow and develop as a human  being."  Read it!  "e know that women in the 50 years  and over age group are badly neglected in feminist publications(and every  other publication for that matter!)  One of our members who wrote in to  complain about this apparent lack  of interest in women in her age group  referred to herself as one of "the  forgotten women." No group of women  should be neglected or "forgotten".  But we are'finding it very difficult  to obtain information on women in  the 50 years and over group.

However the return has been a little  disappointing.  From a membership  of over 1000, 26 people filled in  and returned the Questionaire.  Their  suggestions and opinions have been  most valuable but it is certainly a  very small sampling of the membership.  On the basis of the Questionaire  responses received to date, the following results have been tallied:  POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT  1. VSW will feature women candidates  in KINESIS and sponsor all candidates  meetings on women's issuesswhenever  possible (e.g. in the upcoming civic  election campaign). This would enable  members to decide for themselves their  own degree of involvement.  Is this sufficient for you?  y£*~i3       NO-5  2. If not:  A.

Women candidates who display a  serious concern about inequities  pertaining to women and a genuine desire to correct them.  C. Male candidates who have consistently supported women's issues.  D. No candidates.  }*S-I  »©-/  The general opinion was that Kinesis  was an effective communication link  between members and there were several interesting suggestions for  topics to deal with in future issues.  Members who had made use of VSW services such as Ombuds, Transition House,  Orientation Meetings,etc. offered  warm praise for the help they had  received.  If you would like to express your  opinion please do so!  It does not  need to be written on the Questionaire form - just jot down your ideas,  suggestions, complaints,opinions.  Communication goes two ways - we would  love to hear from you! 15  SFWR UNABLE TO GET OFF GROUND      ft$\  The 1000 members of Stewardesses for  Womens rights are fighting their  image of sexy, flying waitresses.  They have produced a 60 second commercial outlining the exhaustive  training in all phases of emergency  procedure that they must undergo.  It is an attempt to educate the public  to the seriousness of the position  of stewardess on commercial flights.  The reason you have not seen this  "counter-commercial" is because the  television stations have refused to  run it. After all, they make big  money running airline ads such as  National Airlines*"Fly Me", and  Continental's "We Really Move Our  Tail For You." '  The airlines are hoping that SFWR  will not reach the 34,000 stewardesses who. are not yet members.  One  company refused to sell SFWR a list  of its stewardesses (although it does  sell the list to hosiery and cosmetic  manufactures) and stated the reason  was SFWR was a feminist organization.  miSCELLttNY  ON SETTING UP AN OMBUDSERVICE  Gene Errington, VSW Ombudswoman, has  drawn up an excellent step-by-step  guide to setting up an ombudservice.  The guide lists the essential publications you must have at your disposal, tells you how to establish  contacts with such community members  as lawyers, MLAs,-doctors, psychiatrists and also with important groups  and agencies such as the Women's Bureau  of the Department of Labour and the  Advisory Council on the Status of  Women.  There is a point-by-point  list of what kind of cases to accept,  how to handle these cases and how to  advertise and publicize your ombudservice.  If you wish a copy of this excellent  guide, contact Karen Richardson of  Western Canadian Women's News Service,  2029 West Fourth Ave, Vancouver.B.C.  ALL WOMEN CANDIDATES MEETING  The VSW sponsored All Women Candidates  Meeting held November 14 in the main  Vancouver Library was a great success!  Twenty-nine of the candidates featured  in the November issue of Kinesis spoke  at the meeting.  In her opening remarks Chairperson  Gene Errington stressed the importance of having women in positions  where decisions are made that affect  us all and spoke of the "double  burden" carried by women in politics.  The candidates spoke in three groups -  Council, School Board,Parks Board and  at the end of each group of candidates -  there followed a lively discussion  period.'  The candidates expressed their concern about the abortion issue, the  problems of poor people, the inadequate housing and child care facilities  in the city and the role sterotyping  that still exists in the school system.  At the conclusion of the meeting the  candidates expressed their appreciation to Bobbie Patrick and her committee for providing them with the  opportunity to present their platforms.  4  •C. Police  Commission Task Force  on Women  KfitftY M   —   (gETQl^QFTtiEW^  W«~^S  -£*fe^=~*  TASK FORCE ON WOMEN AND THE POLICE  The B.C. Police Commission has established a Task Force on Women and  the Police to study three areas of  concern: women as police officers,'  women as victims of crime, and  women as offenders.  In all three of these areas the  relationship of women to the police  may well be different from that of  men to the police.  In studying  these issues, the Task Force wants  to draw upon the experience of as  many parts of the province as  possible.  Thus> the Task Force  would like to hear the experiences,  opinions and ideas of your groups  and your communities in these areas.  There are no policewomen outside  of Victoria and the Lower Mainland,  but the Task Force would like to  know how' you would react to women  police officers in your communities.  What jobs do you think they could do?  Should do? How do you think your  community would react to them?  In the area of women as victims, the  Task Force would like to know what  experiences women in your community  have when they are victims of crime.  Are the police generally helpful and  sympathetic or not? Is there a dif-  erence in treatment depending on the  crime, e.g. burglary verus rape?  How are family disputes and family  assults handled ? Do the police  respond at all to such complaints  and how?  Finally, if you have any information  concerning the treatment of women  offenders by the police in your community^ the Task Force would like to  share it.  If you have any ideas or information  you'feel would be useful to the Task  Force please contact Joanne Prindiville,  the researcher for the group, at:  British Columbia Police Commission  409 Granville Street  Vancouver, B.C.  684-2137  Since the Task Force will be preparing  recommendations for consideration  by the BCPC at the end of the year,  input should be made as soon as  possible to have maximum effect.  Any information or ideas you can  provide will be greatly appreciated  and will assist the Task Force  enormously in its study. And it may  provide the basis for substantive  necessary changes.  -excerpted from letter from  Rev. R.A.

Judging from past performance, Canadian  films were well on the way to establishing themselves to be traditionally  bad. Here is one film that defied  this nearly sacred tradition - a  comedy no less.  The main theme of this story is the  initiation of a young cub reporter  into the rough world of the newspaper  business and women. The setting is  in a great buzzing metropolis in  Canada.  I couldn't pinpoint the location any closer except that there was  a lot of snow and trees.  The only  bit of Canadiana missing was the  Great Mounties.  The time is somewhere  around being paid $ 18 per week and  coffee being a nickel.  The characters included: a managing  editor, the number one boss, whose  talents were limited to twisting up  his face, bellowing, firing people,  and being as incompetent as humanly  possible; the city editor whose  dreams of making theirs a great newspaper were fulfilled only by means  of slipping into print little stories  describing the boss, ie., that the  boss was an imbecile and behaved  accordingly; and Sonny, the newspaper  photographer, whose greatest preoccupation was women   how to get them  into bed in the fastest, easiest way  possible. A regular chubby, locker-  room talking Don Juan. Last but not  least, there was Mr. Barnes, the  young cub reporter, fresh out of  McGill, embarking on his chosen  career and leaping wholeheartedly into  every pitfall he could, including  falling in love with a woman reporter  from a rival newspaper.  This wasn't just love for sex.  It  was the REAL THING. As he described  it to Sonny,"...it's okay to do it  if you're not in love...but you can't  if you are (in love)...but then, if,  unless you really are, then it's  okay..." — the general gist of what  he was saying being that love, sex  and respect were all rolled in one.  (Pardon the pun).  It was a touchingly  sweet, even quaint, attitude but  where was he all his life? The concept boggled Sonny's mind.  But that  wasn't all. Young Mr. Barnes was  also a virgin. At this point, Sonny  took to serious drinking.  The object of Mr. Barnes' affections  was Julia the dedicated and beautiful reporter whose only goal was to  form a newspaper workers' union  using any and every means at her  disposal, especially those outlined  in the Feminine Wiles Manual. A few  examples of the guidelines:  leaving  her reporter's pencil behind so that  Mr. Barnes could chase after her to  return it. This was a variation of  the dropping-the-lace hanky routine.  Another example: giving Mr. Barnes  the "I would if I could" look in the  eyes but doesn't.  This is from the  chapter entitled "How to Get What  You Want" from the above-mentioned  Manual, guideline numbered #3B.  It  is commonly referred to as holding  out. Don't knock it, it worked but  not until after the city editor's  wife took a hand in things and gave  Mr. Barnes a few pointers. Now here  was a real woman.  She was out to  seduce him and seduce him she did.  No messing around. He was a better  man for it, her favours that is,  not the best, mind you, but at least  better.  Improvement, like good help,  is hard to come by these days.  As a Canadian movie, this was one of  the best so far.  The comedy was  actually funny. Wayne and Shuster,  we didn't even miss you. Migawd, it's  almost sacriligious. What's Canadian  filmmaking coming to?    " ■        " .  &      - Monica Mui  WHAT ONE  WOMAN  CAN DO  GET  INTO  ACTION. I 7  A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE  FELLOW TEACHERS,  I DID NOT HAVE "MONO"!  If a friend breaks a leg, you say,  "That's too bad, Jane.", visit her  at the hospital, sign the cast and  walk out knowing she is fine.  If Jane has a nervous breakdown,  your reaction will be very different.  The family will likely tell only  close friends whom they can trust to  be discreet. Younger brothers and  sisters are often lied to about the  real nature of the illness.  Few  friends will overcome all obstacles,  including the stigma surrounding the  illness and go to visit Jane.  This  is unfortunate, for as pointed out  by R.D. Laing, the patients' family  situation is often the original cause  of their problem.  If Jane is to  return "outside", she vitally needs  the support of friends while in the  hospital.  The tight-lipped, close mouthed,  "we-must-protect-you" attitude toward  mental illness is a crippling thing  to the disturbed person.  Firstly,  it may keep them from seeking help  until they are forcibly brought to  the hospital by friends or family.  Secondly, it turns patients into  round-shouldered failures, when they  get out of hospital.  If you break  your leg skiing, people readily accept  your "accident".  They do not hold  you responsible for it. Yet, when  someone has been mentally ill, they  are made to feel guilty and ashamed.  Another aspect of the secrecy surrounding the whole psychiatric process is the legal aspects surrounding  distribution of videotapes and tape  recordings of patients in psychiatric  sessions.  If former patients were  not afraid of people's reactions,  these could be released and made public. As an educator, I feel it is  essential for public understanding  that they are.  Students should be  able to watch a psychiatrist helping  a patient and see a schizophrenic,  a psychotic or a manic depressive in  the acute stages of the illnesses.  J,ust as literature now abounds with  accounts of mental illness; Mitford's  Zelda, Virginia Woolf's Diary, Plath's  The Bell Jar, Baker's description of  Hemingway's breakdown before his  suicide,  I would also tell students  about Malcolm Lowry and note the  link between his alcoholism and mental illness.  The subject should be  made fascinating and approached  without fear.  Jane was me, ten years ago.  Between  the ages of 20-25, I had three nervous breakdowns.  They began when I  left the interior to come to U.B.C.  At home I had been talented, attractive and well-liked.  Perhaps the  only signs heralding a breakdown  might have been an unusually high-  low mood swing, as well as a curiously  deep lack of self-confidence.  The  experience of the breakdowns was a  crushing blow for me.  I emerged  shaky, scared and ashamed.  I did not  tell anyone I was seeing a psychiatrist nor did I mention to strangers  having had a breakdown. My recovery  was gradual, with the aid of many  friends I taught school and later  returned to U.B.C. to finish my  degree.  This summer things looked good. A  successful teaching year ended. An  interesting summer job.  Some poetry  being published. Many fine people.  On the surface, all looked rosy.  Except people were telling me to  "slow down", "take it easy", "take  care" instead of goodbye. And I  occasionally rationalized to close  friends that as long as I ate and  slept properly, all would be well.  I clung to this myth even though I  began to feel pushed and hyperactive.  Labour Day weekend, I drove up to  cover a Rock Festival at (ironically)  Knutsford near Kamloops for a local  magazine.  After running out of gas  at 11 p.m. near Cache Creek, irrational  incident compounded on irrational  incident and I wound up about 4 a.m.,  acutely disturbed in the Kamloops  jail. Kamloops, a city of over 5,000  (remember that mental illness hits  one in ten) did not have adequate  facilities to handle my type of  illness.  Family and friends went through a  nightmare, on hearing first, that I  was missing and then at the fact the  RCMP were driving me to Crease Clinic.  Lawyer and journalist friends of mine  promised my parents assistance. My  former doctor was contacted and  efforts were made to arrange a transfer for me to Vancouver General Hospital when I was calmer.  If you are  admitted by the police to Crease,  you generally stay there one month  until your case is reviewed in  Victoria.  At Crease Clinic, I was put on a  drug which started to be used six  years ago, sodium lithium. And  within a week I was functioning  normally, arguing with the nurses  about the nature of my illness,  writing poetry and taking notes on  what was happening around me.  The only fair Way to describe Crease  is to contrast it to VGH. VGH is  intimate and cheerful with a nurse,  assigned to you, who spends time  getting to know you personally and  letting you know you are cared about.  At Crease Clinic the beds were so  narrow and uncomfortable, I had to  take sleeping pills. At VGH the  beds were 50c less a day and softer.  I seldom took sleeping pills.  The boredom of the other patients  and the restless pacing of the men  at Crease gave me an uneasy feeling  that I was on a set of a Peckinpah  movie about an asylum.  This was  enhanced by the Gothic enormity of  the rooms which made patients appear  like separated nucleii. The staff  seemed to only work with the patients  when they were approached. And  though generally kind, I felt they  were too busy to talk.  Patients  seemed a little afraid of both each  other and the staff. At VGH ward  meetings and small groups made you  regard your fellow patients, as  human beings.  There was no humour  at Crease Clinic, but I often laughed  at VGH.  Seven years ago, my experience was  humiliating, but this time the experience was illuminating. Many patients  were round-shouldered and ashamed of  their illness, as I had been. And  somehow my whole struggle with mental  illness fell into perspective.  In  many faces I saw unhappiness and  despair. At Crease, I saw people  with what I termed "burnt-out" eyes.  Listening to patients in the VGH  small group sessions, I pondered how  as an educator, I could teach my  students self-confidence and self-  reliance to avoid this situation.  So many people who talked in small  group sessions were trapped in bad  marital situations and afraid to be  on their own.  I was lucky.  Friends visited me and  were happy to discuss my experience  with me. They also took me out for  dinner almost every night in my last  eight days at VGH. Lawyer friends  watched my situation at Crease, eager  to jump in if needed. My former  doctor immediately helped when contacted. My job is waiting for me and  I have received 20 days full salary  and 70% for these past two weeks.  When I told my friend next door, I  had walked after my release from VGH  to the Kitsilano apartment building  I lived in, alone and happy, she  laughed and said "That's just like  you."  Yevtusheko wrote a poem "Lies" which  jells my feelings both as patient  and educator:  Telling lies to the young is wrong  Proving to them that lies are true  is wrong  Telling them that God's in his  heaven  And all's well with the world  is wrong.  If Yevtusheko is true, why as a writer  and educator, must I lie about my  illness to both teachers and students?  Why do friends go out of their way  to hide facts of my illness, I am  not ashamed to admit. When did my  illness become "mono"? Why couldn't  my students visit me? Why would I  have to lie on an application form  about it if I wanted to get another  job? Why when I am gradually learning to handle an illness that most  of you would consider tragic, do I  have to hide it when talking about  it is one of the better kinds of  therapy? If I can laugh about being  four days in a Kamloops jail, why am  I now being persecuted?  - Name Withheld  "Married men seek psychiatric help  less frequently and remain in asylums  for shorter time periods than do  married women or single men.

Women and Madness -  Phylis Chesler IB  letter      lobby  The following paragraphs are taken  from the CANADIAN PRESS STYLE BOOK,  a guide for writing and filing  editors, revised 1974. We wish  to bring to the attention of  Canadian Press our feelings  concerning the matter of titles.  The LETTER LOBBY COMMITTEE has  decided to focus on this particular  section of the CP style book  on your behalf.  If you want to  let CP know that we find their  policy entirely unsatisfactory  please read the statement carefully (all underlining done by  ourselves), then cut out the  accompanying letter and send it  to the Canadian Press office  in Toronto. You may also wish  to send a copy of the article  and letter to the Vancouver  office at 1455 West 7th Avenue,  Vancouver, or to your local  community newspaper. Let's  get the point across, not only  that one doesn't have to be  militant to use MS., but that  it is an insult to have to be  "prominent in our own right"  before we can be called by our  own name!  fhe following is quoted directly  from the CP Style Book, revised  1974.  "A married woman or a widow, if  addressed as Mrs., always is  referred to by her husband's  Christian name, never by hers.  A married woman prominent in her  own right may be referred to by  her own name without "Mrs",—  Ellen Fairclough for example.  (But if Mrs. is used, she is Mrs.  Gordon Fairclough.)  A widow retains her husband's  Christian name or names.  A divorced woman normally retains  her husband's surname but may use  either her own Christian name  (Mrs. Mary Smith) or her own surname  in lieu of a Christian name  (Mrs. Johnson Smith). Follow  whichever form the woman has  used.  Certain militant members of the  women's liberation movement wish  to be known as Ms. (with period,  pronounced miz or muz) rather than  Miss or Mrs, which they term  degrading♦  Such use is not common,  in Canada. So use Ms. only when  insistently requested. All  stories using Ms. should mention  the request and say whether the  woman in question is married or  single—not as a put-down but as  a matter of news interest.  Here is the letter that the LETTER  LOBBY COMMITTEE suggests you  clip and send.  Canadian Press,  36 King Street East,  Toronto, Ontario  Attention: General Manager  Mr. Dauphinee:  I strongly object to the CP Style  Book ruling on the use of Miss,  Mrs. and Ms. A woman's own name  is her maiden name.  She is not  required by law to take her  husband's name. This is only a  matter of custom.  The ruling assumes that a woman  "prominent in her own right", is  the exception and that wives and  mothers are not newsworthy or  important. This is an insult to  all women.  A woman need not be militant to  prefer the title Ms. This is  used increasingly in Canada and  is widely accepted in the United  States. The title Mr. applies  whether a man is married or not.  The equal term is Ms.  The new Human Rights Code of B.C.  makes it illegal to discriminate  against people in regard to  marital status. A woman's marital  status is not a matter of news  interest.  It stereotypes women  into a role and is no one's  business.  The foreword of the CP Style Book  states, "The purpose of this Style  Book is...not to raise barriers,"  and to present an "impartial picture  of the world." I think the CP  Style Book ruling on women's titles  is PARTIAL to chauvinist prejudice.  It reinforces barriers to women.  I urge you to rescind and abolish  this obsolete ruling. A reply  would be appreciated.  Yours sincerely,  Appointment of two women M.P.s as  Parliamentary Secretaries.  (The nine women elected do constitute  a record - but nine is still  not enough to cheer about!)  ©  66 oue  H£liU\/A  Cf\K  \C 13  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Dear Editor:  Serious consideration should be given  to curtailing production of the pos-*  ter that ends "...children are not  jobs".  I appreciate the intent of  that statement, but I don't appreciate its unfortunate implications,  implications which I find offensive  and ill-conceived however well-  meant .  To say "...children are not jobs"  implies that caring for children  is not a job which is to say takr-  ing care of children is not important.  Jobs define personal importance in our society. Ergo, if  caring for children is not of real  importance, those who are engaged  in child care have no real importance. Moreover, if taking care  of children is of trivial merit,  children themselves can't have  much value. How misogynist (we  all know the sex of most child  care givers) and misopedist can  we get?  I know it is always open season on  housewives.  There are probably more  unflattering stereotypes about us  than any other group going. Nevertheless, before feminists start  taking pot-shots at us too, a sight  should be taken on some important  considerations:  1) Why do we rhapsodize over the  values of quality, 24 hour,  non-sexist child care and then  turn around and put down the very  women who provide it on a personalized basis?  (i.e. do a good  job or at least try in raising  their own children).  2) How can we assume there is going  to be meaningful social change in  the direction we want to see it, -  if feminist opt out of child care  en masse? I ask you who do you  think is going to be having those  children and caring for them? By  the time non-sexist day care becomes available it is already too  late.  Real social change won't  happen by accident but only by  design.  3) How can any one who has not cared  for children on a long term basis  and/or does not intend to in the  future have the temerity to assert "...children are not jobs".  How do you know? Do you posit  an independence and eternal youth  which means you will never have  to depend on other people's children?  4) Zero population growth? Hurrah!  ...but quality as well as quantity has to be considered. Day  care has drawbacks which sometimes makes full-time parenthood "a necessary career, a career which does have its joyous  moments.  5) How can we retroactively insult  our own mothers, most of whom  made our care a full time occupation with at least a few positive consequences for us and  hopefully for them?  Sexism has got to be attacked from  all sides, but if you want to eradicate one of the roots of the problem you have to begin, with children,  in infancy, which is what I am presently doing.  If you prefer to work  on another root, I applaud you, but  I ask your appreciation of the in-  portance of what I'm doing.  I don't  like being patronized and put down  by women any more than I like the  same treatment from men.  "...children are not jobs"? My retort? "This  gallery is closed." because feminists are no longer sniping at the  lifestyles of women which differ  but complement theirs.  Roberta Schlosberg  STAFF REPLY:  We are stunned that this interpretation was possible from our  poster. When we chose this slogan we were responding to what we  saw as a completely different message—a message that said we must  look at the family in a. new and  better way.  Husbands are not "supervisors, foremen'" (New Webster's  Universal Dictionary definition of  'boss'); wives are not "hired out  for a specified time, as a horse"  (same definition* see 'job'); children are not "a piece of work".  Rather, all are members of the family,  all share responsibilities and privileges.  Children, who require special  care, are entitled to receive it from  both parents, and from the community  as well, since they hold our future.  We felt the poster attacked the trivializing of child care, since it  attacked a view of the family that  places the woman, traditionally entrusted with child care, in an inferior position to her husband. We  thought it suggested that the wife  was more than just an employee in the  family. And we thought meaningful  social change requires this new perspective.  It is difficult to explain words or  phrases that are not explicit, as the  words on the posters are not, and  clearly, as tbis letter shows, other  interpretations are possible. We  agree with the views expressed in  tnis letter, and we thought, hoped,  and intended that our poster support  these views.  Dear Kinesis,  Could you help me?  I would like to beg, borrow or steal,  for a short time,a record or tape  made by Jody Eliason (spelling?), or  find a source where I could buy such  a record or tape.  S.

Dear Kinesis,  Meant for awhile to write you - I am  a member of the Vancouver Status of  Women but have lived since May here  in Germany.  You have been very helpful to me  several times on previous occasions,  and I hope you will be able to help  me this time.  I just would like  to ask you to forward the monthly  newsletter to me at my West German  address for the time that I am staying here, will you?!  I asked the people at my last address  in Vancouver to mail it to me, but  they must have liked it themselves,  and they never mailed it to me.  I  can't blame them.  I miss the monthly  issue, the more since people here  are backward compared to North America, particularly where Women's Liberation is concerned. Although the  law grants equal rights, of course  in reality they do not exist.  I just felt it personally last month  when I strictly refused to take turns  in making coffee, because the list  showed only the names of the female  employees of the department, and  not the names of the men, that are  in equal positions.  The old lady  that usually makes the coffee and  wants another lady to help her,was  the worst in attacking me.  She  said,"Are you insane? The gentlemen making coffee and doing the  dishes !" Most of the men turned  against me too, but I stood up for  my beliefs.  So, please, would you mail me the  issue of October or November or both  Attached is a cheque for your costs.  Thanks a lot.  I miss Canada terribly!
