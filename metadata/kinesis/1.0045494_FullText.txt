August 5, 1976  Provincial Secretary  Legislative Buildings  Victoria, B.C.  Dear Ms. McCarthy:  Re: Funding of Vancouver Status  of Women  We understand that Vancouver Status  of Women received funding from Provincial Secretary because we qualify  as a "provincial body" according to  your granting criteria. However,  we hope that those numerous women's  groups who have been denied funding  through your department have not  been left with the impression that  VSW was funded by you as a provincial representative of the entire  B.C. women's movement.  We are a provincial body in that we  provide legal services, skill-sharing,  information and resources to women  and women's groups all over the province, as evidenced by our monthly  reports to you.  But we wish to make  it very clear that we are not a provincial umbrella group for all  feminist organizations. That is the  function of the B.C. Federation Of  Women.  While we speak to issues of common  concern to women throughout the province, we speak on behalf of VSW  only, and not for other women's  groups or centres as we have no mandate to do so.  In the women's movement, we work towards common goals  while remaining independent of one  another, as sister groups.  VSW does  not tell other groups what to do or  think. We act only in an advisory  capacity when requested.  Moreover, we wish to emphasize that  we support the concept of core funding for women's centres throughout  the province because they provide  vital services to women in the local  community which are not available  elsewhere, therefore, we are deeply  distressed that a number of important  women's centres are closing for lack  of funding. We want to make sure  that the government does not believe  that by funding VSW it is meeting the  needs of B.C. women adequately.  We thank you for your consideration  in this matter.

Monday August 9th, 1976 I dropped  my five year old daughter off at  St. Alban's Day Care Centre in  Burnaby. There was no Lainie to  pick up Monday night. Monday  night Lainie was in Winnipeg. I  was at work that day so I am able  to only relate what happened as it  was told to me.  The husband who I have been separated from for almost three years,  arrived at St. Alban's in the morning. He presented identification  and a court order which was certified in Manitoba to the assistant  supervisor of the day care.  She  called the supervisor to ask what  to do, and was told to wait...the  supervisor would come. At some  point in time the chairperson of  the day care centre board was  called.  I was told later that  the "waiting" done that day was  on her instruction.  The court order was read by the  day care centre over the phone to  the police. They said it was  legal and the appropriate action  to take was to release the child.  Lainie left the day care centre at  about 11:30 a.m. with her father.  At 2:30 p.m. I was called at work  and informed of what had happened.  Three hours had passed from the  time Lainie left until I was  called.  I left Manitoba in March with  legal custody of my child, leaving  no forwarding address.  My reason  for leaving was to^establish a new  life for Lainie and myself. I had  spoken with the day care centre  supervisor in June telling her  that there was the possibility of  Lainie's father finding her and  attempting to take her.  Our discussion concluded with her assurance that should this happen, I  would be called immediately. Given  the opportunity, I may have been  able to prevent Lainie's going, as  there is some question about the  validity of a Manitoba court order  in British Columbia.  Why didn't St. Alban's call me before  releasing Lainie in her father's custody? Why did they wait three hours  after she was gone to call me? What  about the effect this will have on  Lainie? Why is she in Winnipeg with  no clothes...none of her prized  possessions?  Is our legal system  truly making the welfare of my child  a priority?  I have no answers.  I miss my Lainie.  She's my daughter.  She's my friend. We grocery shop,  cook meals, clean house; together.  We walk in parks, talk about her day  at school, my day at work, our future;  together. We work, play, and love;  together. And we used to live together.

NEWS  A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME...O  In Ontario, an amendment to the Vital  Statistics Act has made it legal for  a couple to give their child a hyphenated name, combining both the father  and .mother's surnames, providing the  father's name comes first. This  applies also to children born out of  wedlock. Under the old law, children  had to take the father's name, even  in cases where the mother was using  her maiden name and wanted to pass  it onto her children. Previously,  children born out of wedlock would  take the mother's name unless the  father swore paternity, in which case  case the child's last name would be  the father's surname.       (KR)  MS.

New Address:  WOMEN IN FOCUS  #4 - 45 Kingsway  Vancouver, B.C.  (Phone: 872-2250)  As of July 16, 1976 the Women's Office  has been evicted from the Student Union  Building, Room 230, U.B.C.  The reason that was given for this  eviction by the Student Administration  Committee was that the space occupied  by the Women's Office was, "untenably  excessive (sic) for a non-subsidiary  of the Alma Mater Society".  The issue  of space allocation was not discussed  at the meeting which was attended by  representatives of the Women's Office  wherein the motion of eviction was  passed.  Over the past six years, the Women's  Office has been frequently hassled and  undermined by some members of the A.M.S  student executive.  There is a basic  conflict between running a 'Women's  Centre', remaining sensitive to what  is in the best interests of women, and  continuing to attempt to conform and  work within a bureaucratic structure  that is made by and organized with  the interests of those in power (i.e.  a patriarchal society).  About this  particular topic, I hope to write more  in the near future.  In spite of the severe problems of  being constantly harrassed by male  student executives, sporadic and insufficient funding, and working within a university that has never acknowledged or supported the very  important work achieved by the many  women who have mostly donated their  ideas and labour to The Women's Office  of U.B.C, we have managed to operate  in what we consider to be the interests  of women.  Some of the many achievements by members of the Women's Office Collective  include the following:  A. A non-credit Women's Studies Course  offered yearly over the past five  years.  This program consisted of many  topics and mainly took the form of  discussion and lecture groups.  This  non-credit Women's Studies Course led  to the instigation of the Women's  Studies credit course now available at U.B.C.  B. The 'Women's Action Group', which  combined with 'The Women's Grievance  Committee', did much work on campus  fighting the most overt signs of  discrimination against women. W.A.G.  also researched and published the  widely used and well-reputed, "A  Report on the Status of Women at the  University of British Columbia".  This report has led to the formation  of the U.B.C. Committee for wage  parity. This committee allows the  women who teach at U.B.C recourse  to correct wage disparity that may  exist between themselves and their  male peers.  C. 'The Women's Research Collective'  researched and published the student's  experience of discrimination in "The  Voices of Women Students".  This  booklet has been requested by hundreds  of colleges, universities, and libraries across Canada.  D. The Resource Library.  Over the  past six years, we have collected a  large amount of books, publications,  newsletters, magazines, research  papers, newspaper clippings, etc.  which are all cari- catalogued and  available for the use of interested  persons.  In fact, an impressive  literary resource on many topics  ranging through the political, social,  economic, and "cultural".  E. A 'Women's Music Library' consisting of 30 cassette tapes of music  composed and performed by women.  The  range of styles includes jazz, blues  and classical.  F. An 'Audio Tape Library' made up of  many guest speakers. The list is too  long to include here, approximately  35 tapes. Anybody1 that is interested  please write to us for a brochure (see  new address).  G. Our last achievement is the 'Women  in Focus' audio-visual library that  we have established over the last, two  years.  It consists of 36 audio-visual  tapes, most of which are in colour,  are half an hour long and are available for inexpensive rental and resale.  These tapes were produced by an  all-female team who were trained by  'Women in Focus'. They are on and  about women.  Through the production  of these tapes, women have learned  the technical skills of audio-visual  production and have been able to present primary research on women in a  form that can readily be seen and  heard by all women.  For further details, please send for a brochure at  our new address.  These are the major areas that we have  worked in, and so that these various  resources can continue to be used by  women, we have moved them into the  community.  Our new address is: #4 -  45 KINGSWAY, VANCOUVER, B.C.  (PHONE  NUMBER: 872-2250).  "Come up and see  us sometime". We are fortunate to be  able to share an office with 'The  Women's Research Centre of the B.C.  Women's Studies Association'.  Through the 'Women in Focus' audiovisual tape library, we hope to make  ourselves economically viable in order  to continue making this series. During  the last year, 'The Women's Office'  was not funded at all. We have approached many agencies for funding,  any kind of funding, but like so many  women's groups we have found that  there is. a little money for 'innovative' projects, but very little to  sustain a long-term program.  Grace  McCarthy's office of the Provincial  Secretary has not as yet acknowledged  our funding proposal sent to her in  February 1976. This kind of treatment makes it very clear to women what  they can expect from this government. '  We hope that you can help us maintain  our office. We need your emotional  and economic support.  Please feel  free to make use of the resources  listed above, and let us have any new  ideas that you may have for future  programs for our television series.  We would also be happy to talk to  people on the problems and joys of  working in the media.  Thank you for your support in the past  and we hope that you will continue to  support us in the future.

WOMEN   UNIONIZE  bank  The Service Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) applied  to the Canada Labour Relations Board  for Union certification for the Victory  Square Branch of the Canadian Imperial  Bank of Commerce in Vancouver. The  application is the first in the history  of the Bank of Commerce.  There are twenty employees at the  Victory Square Branch. Eighteen are  women. The starting salary is about  $600 per month. An employee at the  Branch tells why they decided to  unionize: Though we work for one of  the largest and most profitable employers in the country, we make some  of the worst wages in the work force.  We can barely live on the salaries  that we are making. Inflation takes  its worst toll on the unorganized  worker. The Bank is now using the  excuse of the Anti-Inflation Board to  keep any wage increase at an absolute  minimum. Today more than ever we need  the protection of a Union contract."  The Service Office and Retail Workers  Union of Canada (SORWUC) was formed  in 1972 by women workers in Vancouver  who are committed to eradicating the  unfair difference between male and  female wages. The Banks are well-  known for discrimination against their  female employees. In the last several  years there has been some improvement  in promotion opportunities for women,  but the vast majority of women in the  Bank are concentrated in the lowest  paid categories. 72% of all Bank employees are women. Yet in 1975, of  the 67,000 women who were working in  the eight largest chartered banks,  48,600 made $585 per month or less.  (See Employment in Chartered Banks,  Marianne Bossen, published by Advisory  Council Status of Women and Canadian  Banking Association).  SORWUC sees the application by the  Victory Square Branch employees as  a major breakthrough in what has so  far been a totally unorganized industry. One of the women employees  comments: "It is a common myth that  banks ca^n't unionize. But after a  little investigating we have found  the opposite. As employees in banks  we fall under the federal Canada  Labour Code. This law guarantees us  the right to unionize into the union  of our choice. It only takes 35% of  the employees in your Branch (excluding management) to sign union cards  — then you can"apply for union  certification. If a majority of the  employees have joined the union, you  will be certified automatically. If  you have less than a majority, the  Labour Relations Board can order a  secret ballot vote'.'  "As bank employees in SORWUC we will  have our own union Local, we will  elect our own Executive and negotiating team, and we Will decide ourselves  what we need or don't need in our  Union contract.  SORWUC is continuing its leaflet campaign at banks and hopes to apply for  several more branches in the coming  months. They are anxious to talk to  other bank employees about unionizing  — the problems and the possibilities.  All replies in strictest confidence.

Board covering employees at Vancouver  Transition House.  The union's primary demands were for  recognition of "on call" workers.  These are relief staff who replace  permanent staffers for sick leave,  designated holidays and other compensating time off and for vacations.  In lieu of fringe benefits, they will  be receiving an additional $.2,00 per  shift, double time for working on  statutory holidays and 6% of their  gross earnings for vacation pay  (equivalent to three weeks annual  vacation).  Also included in the collective  agreement are clauses providing for  International Women's Day (March 8)  as a designated holiday, a 4% shift  differential since Transition House  is a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week operation,  and, for employees who do not own a  vehicle, a taxi allowance of up to  $8.00 for staff transportation between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and  7:00 a.m.  The new Agreement provides for wages  of $6.99 per hour, including the  shift differential.

RAPE VICTIMS PROSECUTED  Off Our Backs, a Washington D.C  women's news journal, reports that  in Australia, two women have been  charged with 'false complaint' after  reporting rapes. The charge, under  the "Vagrancy, Gaming and Offenses  Act", is a rarely used one and has  never before been applied to a rape  case.  One of the women, victim of a gang  rape by nine men, was acquitted after  outcry by Australian feminists.  She  had withdrawn her rape complaint when  the tremendous strain of an 8-hour-  long police interrogation immediately  following the rape became too much  for her; she was charged shortly  after.  The second woman, however, was convicted, given a year's probation,  and ordered to pay court costs. The  police charged her with false complaint after taking the words of the  rapist and his witnesses, BEFORE any  court proceedings had even taken  place, that no rape had occurred.  A group called "Australian Women  Against Rape" will help to fight the  conviction when an appeal comes up  shortly. As Rosalind Innes, a member  of the group, says, "...Not only is  it outrageous as an individual instance of the way rape laws operate,  but it is setting a very dangerous  precedent to stop women even more  from reporting rape." She is asking  for the support of the Women's Movement internationally.  To protest the use of false complaint  charges in rape cases, send letters  or telegrams to: 1) District Court  Judges, District Court Bldg, North  Quay, Brisbane 400; 2) Minister for  Justice, c/o Justice Dept, Old Treasury Bldg, Queen St, Brisbane (Mr.Knox);  3) Minister for Police, c/o Minister's  Office, 161 Ann St, Brisbane 04000  (Mr. Max Hodges). i '  - Janet Beebe  ACSW  ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE STATUS OF  WOMEN  The following recent publications of  The Advisory Council on the Status of  Women are available from Box 1541,  Station B, Ottawa KIP 5R5.

WOMEN OF OUR TIMES  VANCOUVER WOMEN OF OUR TIMES  At this time, when the art of communication has reached a peak never before achieved in human memory, whole  nations have been unable to communicate  with each other. This shouldn't surprise us because very often two people  living in the same house are not able  to communicate.  Vancouver Women of Our Times expresses  a desperate need to achieve the art  of communication — between nations  — between people in the same country  — the same city — the same home.  Vancouver Women of Our Times proposes  to learn by each other's need and  experience how to achieve wisdom and  beauty for the benefit of ourselves  and the people with whom we come in  contact.  Vancouver Women of Our Times proposes  to have a very minimal exchange of  money, .if at all. There will be no  raffles, bazaars, etc. There will be  no refreshments so that no one will  have the responsibility of preparing  them.  Vancouver Women of Our Times will  learn to communicate with one another  — perhaps in so doing they will learn  to what depths they have that need —  to what depths the people around them  have that need — and with practice  perhaps they will somehow learn to  fill the void.  The first chapter of Women of Our  Times will be written in Vancouver  and aimed at the age group between  forty and sixty-five because it is  the group which is most neglected  and is suffering greatly, not only  because it is beset by personal problems but also because these women  feel the lack of communication most  obviously.  Later, when we have learned more, we  will perhaps enlarge our scope.  For more information about Vancouver  Women of Our Times call: Molly at  731-0890 between 9 a.m. & Noon (except  Tues. & Thurs.) and between 6 p.m.  & Midnight any night, OR  Grace at 874-0053.  nuiw  breast     cancer  A report for the Registered Nurses  Association of.B.C. on breast cancer  has been published to help fulfill  recommendation 277 of the Foulkes  Report — "That the government promote increased research into the  clinical aspects of breast cancer  and its treatment."  This report unearthed some startling  statistics. They found that breast  cancer is the leading cause of death  of all cancers in women, and one out  of 15 women will contract it. Twenty-  one per cent of cancer deaths and 4%^  of all deaths are due to breast can- -  cer. Women between 35 and 54 are the  most suseptible. Here, this disease  is responsible for 32% of deaths from  cancer and 13% of all deaths, making  it the biggest woman killer for that  age group.  The report committee agreed that something had to be done. They felt that  public education is essential since  a breast self-exam and a visit to the  doctor is the most important step  towards early detection. But there  is a problem. Publicity seems to  bring out those women who are relatively aware in the first place. The  self-exam is important to all women,  though. How is it possible to penetrate through the barrier to isolated,  unaware women?  Mammography was also considered to  be another early detection tool. We  must get our definitions straight at  this point, since mammography is often confused with thermography, Xeromammography, and mammory duct contrast  radiology. Mammograpny xs a sate  tissue type of x-ray of the breast  using a low kilovoltage. There is no  discomfort and the dose is considered  acceptable. This instrument may be  used as a diagnosis in symptomatic  women or as a general screening of  the population. However, it does not  substitute for a biopsy or a 'palpable  lesion'. (Feeling a lumpc) If the  mammography does not show an abnormality when other symptoms are appar  ent, it does not ent;irely^ rule out  cancer. The value of the alternate  methods above has not yet been ascertained .  The report came to several conclusions: 1)Expanding B.C.'s screening  program ,is uncertain due to a shortage of funds.  2)To decide how often and at  what ages a woman should be screened,  B.C. needs a pilot program,,  3)The role and contribution of'  different occupations in the health  field regarding early detection of  breast cancer requires further examination.  4)Alternate methods of screening need further study.  5)Public education is only  reaching part of the population, and  further study is required to ensure  that the information is disseminated  more widely.  6)Screening programs should be  operated so that quality is not overlooked for quantity.  A copy of this report may be obtained  from the Registered Nurses Association  of B.C., 2130 West 12th Ave. Vancouver.  (Reprinted from Kelowna Status of  Women Newsletter, July 1976)  the pill  BREAST CANCER AND THE PILL  An article in July 76 Ms. reports that the Journal of the  National Cancer Institute says  that patients who took oral  contraceptives for two to four  years have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer—  2% times that of women who did  not take the pill. Women with  a prior history of benign breast  lumps increase the risk 11 times  by prolonged use of the pill.  The statistics were derived from  a 3 year case-controlled study  at the California State Department of Health.  (KR)  pregnancy  TEENAGE PREGNANCY EPIDEMIC  Good Housekeeping magazine, June  1976 reports that in the USA teenage  pregnancy is the nations' number one  health problem among adolescent  girls.  In 1974, an estimated  610,000 unmarried girls became  pregnant, an average of one or two  for every high school classroom.  What alternatives did they seek?  About 110,000 married hastily.  Half of those will probably be  divorced in 5 years.  275,000  sought abortions.  Currently one  out of three legal abortions in  the US is performed on an unwed  mother.  About 200,000 chose to  be unwed mothers.  The illegitimacy rate increase only in this  group. Among unwed mothers at  school, half dropped out. National Planned Parenthood estimated  that one in every five young women 15 to 19 will become pregnant  before 20. According to a Johns  Hopkins study, three out of ten  who have premarital intercourse,  became pregnant.  (K.R.)  long life  aOMEN LIVE LONGER  Latest U.S. government figures show  women living almost 8 years longer  than men (75.3 years for women vs.  67.6 for men), up from between 2 to  3 years at the turn of the century.  Genetic and hormonal differences are  often common explanations for this .  gap. Some scientists thought men had  more stress than women which shortened  their lives, but among equally cloistered monks and nuns, the nuns live  longer. As one scientist said, "Women  seem to be built for the longer haul."  (New York Post,1/12/76. Reprinted  from Health Right, Women's Health  Forum, New York). 8  A 6HOET'STOGY  I was experiencing my usual spaciness  upon hitting a new town. It had been  several hours since I had had conversation with anyone, other than "coffee  please" and as I sat in the streetside  cafe with progressive jazz notes dancing on my coffee steam, I pulled out  some nude snap shots taken in a Wool-  worths booth in L.A. and thought of  better days.  My heels were uncomfortable from breaking in ray earth boots, and my.fingernails were full of tobacco collected  from each dive into my phony suede  coat's pockets looking for change; and  against my better image, loneliness  was seeping in through the second hole  in my pierced ear. I would have enjoyed  anyone's company just then. When I  felt I could no longer guiltlessly  have another re-fill, I collected myself and my pictures and began strolling aimlessly down the sidewalk. My  head was inside the Bla Bla Cafe on  Ventura Blvd. when I first heard his  voice. It was coming to me by way of  Tedda's blues voice who I had heard  several weeks previously. When the  two meshed, he repeated:  "So you're a tourist,too."  "Yes," I said looking into the eyes  of a middle aged businessman in his  double knit best. "How did you know?"  "By the way you were walking. You seem  to be at a slower pace than most of  the people here. Sort of looking  around."  Upon his comment, my mind shifted to  a scene in a southern California  amusement park where a sailor had  mistaken me for a hustler because I  was "walking slow and sort of looking  around". He was so sure of it, that  he and his friends pooled their money  in front of the double ferris wheel  while waiting for me to slink by.  "And you're a tourist, also?" I hear-  my conversation starved voice saying.  "Yes, I'm in town for a business meeting. Would you like some coffee?"  I thought of the four cups that I had  just had and agreed that coffee and  conversation would be nice. And so  began another incident.  We walked for several blocks before  I realized that we had passed several  coffee shops and had that not been our  agreement? I once again recalled a  situation —in San Francisco this  time— whereupon being approached by  two young sub-normal looking men, I  consented to coffee and a free ride  to the airport. Who would have thought  that such dorkey lads would have had  a small room "on the way to the airport" furnished with girlie photos,  bar-bells and whips. My college track  training saved my body and my soul  that day.  "I don't know, sometimes I just prefer  petting..."  What? What had he been saying to me  while I time-travelled?  "I think you misunderstood me. I  really thought we were going for  coffee." Reality closed in.  "Oh, I know. But my car is just down  here. Tell me how do you like men  going down..."  "I don't like men doing anything."  I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and turned to face his shocked  gaze. "You asked me if I wanted coffee,  and that was all. I had been sitting  in that cafe for hours. I wanted conversation. That's the only reason I  agreed to come along. I don't relate  to men sexually."  "Oh! You're bi-sexual. How exciting.  Where did you say you were from? Los  Angeles?"  His entire face lit up, resembling  that of a jack-o-lantern.  "I didn't say J was tbi-sexuall" I was  angry at him for being titilated by  my sexuality and angry at me for falling into another trap.  "Oh, I see. So you're not interested  at all. I have money. Here, let's sit  down and talk about it." He motioned  to the bus bench. "I knew two lesbians  once," he continued, "let me tell you  what they liked. No, better still,  what do you like..."  No more. I turned and started walking  away and in doing so heard a nauseous  voice shouting, "I like it because  it's warm and tender and EQUAL! Get  it buddy? EQUAL!" I turned immediately  into a near-by bookstore and ignoring  the questioning eyes of the sales  clerk found my way to the travel section. (Knowing he really expected me  to go to the homosexual shelf so he'd  know for sure.) Why me? Was it really  the way I walked? It couldn't be my  clothing. Jeans on women were no longer  considered a novelty. And he couldn't  see my breasts under my jacket. Would  travelling alone always make me this  vunerable to such otherwise obvious  situations?  I thought the person next to me was  eyeing me suspiciously, (by now everyone was a lesbian spy) so I grabbed  a book off the shelf and stared deep  into the black on white, which soon  became white on black and then blurred. I finally decided that it really  wasn't my problem and that indeed I  was just a victim of circumstance,  (circumstances being that I was functioning alone as a woman in a non-  supportive environment by walking  slowly down the street).  I gave the travel section a legitimate  check and upon replacing the book I  had been holding, chose a new one. The  sales clerk smiled as I made my purchase.  The evening fog was coating Santa Cruz  as I stepped out the door. The streets  were fairly populated. The jazz musicians had just stopped performing. The  night looked good. I thought perhaps  I'd stop in at Mona's Lounge for a  dance or two, later on. I had just  begun thumbing through my book while  walking down the street when somewhere between "Things to do and see"  and "Accomodations in your favorite  city" I heard:  "Hey you with the book. Wanna have a  drink?"  I didn't look up. I didn't smile. I  just went to Mona's an hour earlier.  - Connie Smith  celebrate  LABOUR DAY THIRD WORLD WOMEN OUTREACH  COUNTRY CELEBRATION  A group of women and children living  in a wilderness area of Northern California are holding a Third World &  Working Class Women Celebration over  the Labour Day weekend.

Before  joining the VSW Ombuds Staff, Johanna  worked with Vancouver Rape Relief and  Vancouver Women's Health Collective  and brought with her a wealth of experience and organizing ability.  Johanna lists the Women's Rally for  Action as one of the highlights of  her year: "To be involved in one of  the biggest political actions ever  undertaken by women in British Columbia  was for me a tremendous gain in  political consciousness and organizational experience."  Johanna feels that she has learned  "an incredible amount about the  Specifics of discrimination against  women, and the laws and institutions  of B.C., through Ombuds work." But  she also mentions the frustration  of never having enough time to "sink  my teeth into any one issue... of  always feeling fragmented."  It    2         CD O  3   F>» 3  MOO.

By developing and using her skills  in research and writing Johanna intends  to continue to work within the women's  movement — but independently rather  than within a salaried structure.  We wish Johanna Love and Luck — but  we will certainly miss her clear perception and calm reasonableness and  her ability in helping people work  together.  music  FEMINIST MUSIC LOVERS   Buy a Holly Near record!

HELP  Last month (August issue) we mentioned  some of the jobs around the VSW office  that we would appreciate having help  with. We are very pleased that a member has contacted us and- volunteered  to attend Human Rights hearings. This  will mean that VSW will always be  aware of what is going on at these  hearings even when a staff member  doesn't have time to attend.  We have also been extremely fortunate  during the past few weeks in having  the volunteer help of Hiroshima  Chakravarti! Hiro has organized the  filing system on MPs, MLAs, and Alder-  people and is busy gathering information for each of the files; she answers  phones; gives out information; proofreads KINESIS; exerts a calming influence .... and we don't know how we  would have managed without her in  the last few frantic days!  VIP worker Molly Dexall is up-dating  the clipping file and she and Violet  Johnson are re-organizing the whole  file to make it easier to work with.  Remember anyone out there who is doing research — this file is very  useful and is available for anyone  to use.  VIP worker Andi Wescott has been  getting all our publications in order.  (Send for a VSW Publications list.)  We were low in stock or had completely  run out of some of the materials and  Andi has been producing more. She  looks quite 'fetching' (not to mention  'winsom') in her canvas printer's  apron.  The Office has been extremely busy  and it doesn't look like it is going  to let up. We get a million ... well  an awful lot ... of phone calls everyday and it is a tremendous help to  the staff if someone volunteers to  do a few hours of answering. So  anyone out there ....  Book Reviews — VSW gets books from  publishers for our library if we  write and print a book review. Drop  by the Office and pick up a book to  review. 10  WHAT IS A WOMEN'S CENTRE?  B.C. has possibly the most prolific "  "grass roots" women's movement in  Canada. The source of its strength  lies in the many feminist groups and  centres located throughout the province. Each status of women group is  unique, developing in response to  the needs of community women in each  locality. In general there are four  types of women's centres:  a) action groups lobbying for specific  women's rights legislation, services,  etc.  b) drop-in centres with ombudservices,  members' activities, public education.  c) transition houses giving temporary  crisis accomodation and counselling  to women.  d) special interest groups in government and professional women's agencies.  Each women's group is at a different  level of development,, feminist consciousness and political commitment.  Many start as informal consciousness-  raising groups, growing through the  stages of information and referral,  media work, and political action.  Status Of women groups are founded.on  the principle that as long as women  are treated unequally in our society,  compensatory services such as those  offered by feminist women's centres  will be required. Feminist groups are  engaged in a plethora of activities  aimed at eliminating sex discrimination  against women, both individually and  en masse, in all aspects of our society.  (Reprinted from the Introduction to  Guide to the B.C. Women's Movement)  Money is tight this year — sound  familiar? — and it is more important  than ever that women's groups maintain contact. KINESIS is received by  many women's centres in B.C. or is  received by women who are members of  their local groups and subscribers to  KINESIS. Women all over the province  are urged to make use of KINESIS as  both a source of information and a  contact line. Let KINESIS know what  and how you are doing so the information can be shared with other women.  Following is the information that  we have received about the funding  situation of groups in B.C. If there  is more information to be added PLEASE  let us know.  CAMPBELL RIVER WOMEN'S PLACE: applied  to Provincial Secretary for funds &  were refused. Trying to stay alive  in one small room on donations.  CHILLIWACK WOMEN'S GROUP: a member  of Fraser Valley Women's Coalition  & will receive operating expenses as  needed from Coalition's Sec. of State  grant.

CRANBROOK WOMEN'S GROUP:is intending  to apply to Sec. of State in the fall.  DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE WOMEN'S CENTRE: a  .  drop-in centre for women in Vancouver's  East Hastings area. Volunteer at Centre  states they have applied to "about 50  different places in the last 6 months  — private organizations, government  departments, etc." At present the  Centre has an interim grant from Sec.  of State to cover rent and utilities.  This is expected to run out bv the  end of November. Volunteers are staffing the Centre. A L.I.P. application  is planned in the fall. A request to  the Provincial Secretary for an outline  of the Office's criteria was never  answered.  FRONYA ( MISSION WOMEN'S CENTRE): is  a member of the Fraser Valley Women's  Coalition and will receiving operating  expenses as needed from the Coalition's  Sec. of State Grant. Fronya received  a Seco of State IWY Grant and has  managed to eke it out in order to  exist until now.  FRASER LAKE WOMEN'S COUNCIL: application to the Provincial Secretary was  turned down. They have received some  money from Sec. of State.  FRASER VALLEY WOMEN'S COALITION: a  coalition of five women's groups in  the Fraser Valley — Fronya (Mission),  Maple Ridge Women's Centre, Ishtar  Resource Centre, Port Coquitlam Area  Somen's Centre, and Chilliwack Women's  Centre — applied to Secretary of  State for a grant. The Coalition  has received approximately $12,000  to cover operating expenses for the  Coalition. A 3-person committee will  administer funds to the member groups  as needed. The grant also provides  for a half-time salary for a worker  who will maintain a library, do public  relations, publish a newsletter with  contributions from the member groups,  co-ordinate activities, organize workshops, etc. The grant is until the  end of the fiscal year. The Coalition  also applied to the Provincial Secretary for $6000 and was turned down.  HOT FLASHES WOMEN'S 'THEATRE: LIP  funding ran out.  ISHTAR TRANSITION HOUSE: the Transition  House was forced to close last Spring  because of lack of funds. Later money  was received from Dept. of Human Re-,  sources to start up another House —  the original house had been rented  after Ishtar was forced to move out.  Ishtar is having difficulty finding  a suitable house — since they will  receive money on a per diem rate it  is not feasible to operate the House  with less than ten beds.  ISHTAR WOMEN'S RESOURCE CENTRE: is a  member of the Fraser Valley Women's  Coalition and will receive operating  expenses from the Coalition's Sec.  of State Grant. Staff is voluntary  and they have had a summer student  working on a Sec. of State Summer  Student Project which ends at the  end of August. They are considering  an application to LIP in the fall.  ISIS, WOMEN Aim  MEDIA: funding application to Provincial Secretary turned  down (see KINESIS, August issue,-page  15 for details). Appeal rejected.  Provincial Secretary suggested Isis  apply to Dept. of Education. Dept.  of Education rejected this suggestion.  They are desperately trying to find  a source of funds. In the meantime  booking requests for their services  and materials continue to pour in  from all over the province. Watch  KINESIS for announcement of how they  can be contacted after September.

This  column will discuss legal separations,  restraining orders, possession orders  and family assaults.  The Court can make an order that the  couple live separate and apart. The  husband and wife cannot force the  other to live together. The Court  can also make an order as to possession of the family home.  A spouse  can be granted the right to live in  the family home, irrespective of who  owns the home.  For example, where  the wife has custody of the children, she may be given possession of  the home. This order is effective  until the family property disputes  are legally settled, in a superior  court.  If one party has been harassing the  other, the Family Court can also  issue a restraining order requiring  that person to stay away from the  family.  Even if the family home  belongs to the offending spouse,  the Court can require that spouse  stay away from the family.  A  restraining order is valuable in  that it gives the police the authority to remove the offending  spouse if he breaks the terms of  the order; if you have no order the  police have no authority to act.  Family Court also deals with criminal assault cases which involve  family matters. During the hours  that the Court is open, family assault complaints should be filed  at the Family Court.  In the evenings  and on weekends, the complaint can  be filed at the regular police station. The Court staff are often  unwilling to take family assault  complaints as they are sometimes  dropped after the heat of the  moment has passed.  Be insistent.  If your complaint is proven in  Court, the Judge can order the spouse  to post a bond (a sum of money) that  he will keep the peace in the future.  If he breaks the terms of the order,  i.e. threatens you or assaults you  again, he forfeits the money to the  Court. Also, if you are not living  together, he can be ordered to stay  away from your family.  The Court  order is useful if future incidents  are likely to occur because the  police then have legal grounds to  keep the spouse away.

Such international mobli-  zation occurred, for example, in  support of the Three Marias in Portugal. Without this kind of support  they might not have been acquitted.  Organizing support of this kind,  whether in the form of fund raising,  publicity, demonstrations, etc. will  be greatly aided by a network in which  at least two women in each country  will take on the task of mailing information sent to them by or about  sisters in need of international  support, to all the feminist/women's  groups in their countries. The Coordinator of this international feminist  network is Nicole Van de Ven, 165  Bvld. General Jacques, 1050 Brussels,  Belgium. Volunteers are now being  sought from each country. An International Feminist Newsletter will be  published every 3 months from information collected at ISIS (cas postal  301 - CH 1227 - Carouge, Geneva,  Switzerland)."  REGISTRY OF CANADIAN WOMEN  The Media Club of Canada has received  a $5,000 grant from National Health  & Welfare to compile a registry entitled Canadian Women of Note, Com-  puterized.

We have  now ordered and receivedl about 50  free feminist paperbacks as review  copies from publishers and now have  a backlog of reviews to publish. I  was happy to receive an offer from  Hellie Wilson of Ottawa to do reviews  of two books she read about in Kinesis.  Hello Hellie if you are reading this  month. Thanks to Angela Page and  Heather Kellerhais for this month's  reviews.  (KR)  BOOK  REVIEW  The Suffragette View  by Antonia Raeborn 1976  Reviewed by Heather Kellerhals  Essentially a picture history of the  early suffragette years, the idea for  this book began with the author's  discovery in 1964 of an album of  suffragette-photographs.  By gradual  additions to this collection and  interviews with surviving suffragettes  or their relatives, the author has  been able to piece together a fairly  complete record of the times.  The book begins with a brief sketch  of the personalities involved in the  founding and initial organization of  the Women's Social and Political Union  in 1903, notably the Pankhursts and  Pethick Lawrences.  It ends with the  beginning of the first world war and  a postcript on women's war effort.  Chapters are well organized:  the  historical background is presented  first, followed by clearly labelled  photographs.  The photographs, many of them available for the first time, dispel the  still widely held notion of the suffragettes as a bunch of wild-eyed  women.  From these pages a striking  collage emerges - women from all  walks of life being drawn together,  skillfully organized and radiating  courage, determination, and a calm  beauty from their faces.  Many of  the photographs stand as a contrast  to the often lurid newspaper descriptions and artistic renditions of  the suffragette movement.  Generally, and I think wisely, the  author reserves personal comment and  allows the photographs to speak for  themselves. On one occasion however,  she states "...it is difficult to  understand why so many of them were  willing to sacrifice their families  and their health by submitting to  imprisonment and forcible feeding.  Such stoicism and suffering seem an  excessive price to pay for the sake  of the Parliamentary vote" - a somewhat naive comment when one looks at  the history of the human race.  Altogether a fascinating book to read  or browse through, with a haunting  cover portrait of a woman that is  repeated on the last page. Pity it  was felt necessary to add Malcolm  Muggeridge's name on the front in  print as large as the author's. He  writes a two page preface!  BOOK REVIEW  13  Laura Secord  by John M. Bassett and A. Roy Petrie  in The Canadians series published  by Fitzhenry & Whiteside, Don Mills  Ontario 1974.  Reviewed by Angela Page.  This series of textbooks is presumably  aimed at the Grade 4-7 age group. It  includes Emily Carr, Marion Hilliard,  Agnes McPhail and Elizabeth Simcoe -  five women to twenty-three men plus  the Group of Seven - as well as Laura  Secord.  Her story is outlined in dramatic  terms, VLth rather irritating imaginary conversations and the odd chapter  on details of domestic life or the  practice of slavery. There are  sketch maps, drawings and reproductions of documents:  an effort is  made to convey the flavour of the  time as well as its military history  and the story of Laura's heroic walk  through unsettled country bearing  news of the enemy.  She comes out of  it as more than a chocolate box heroine (is it uniquely Canadian to turn  popular female figures into brands  of candy?), and a good deal is made  of her and her husband's efforts to  gain financial recognition for the  service she had done her country.  I had not realized before that she  was born in Massachusetts and did not  come to Canada until she was eighteen,  nor that the only official acknowledgement of her bravery in her lifetime was one hundred pounds in gold  from the Prince of Wales in 1860,  nearly fifty years after her walk.  As this is a textbook as well as a  biography of a famous Canadian, I  suppose it is fair enough to put in  frequent questions between the  text and pictures to make sure the  reader is still awake, but I prefer  the simple way in which the story of  Deborah Sampson was told for children  in a recent issue of Ms., without so  much educational padding to disguise  the lack of information about the actual woman involved. This book could  be valuable in reminding children and  teachers that women as well as men  can be brave, independent and resourceful, especially in time of war,  but the point is not put across  clearly enough for me.  BOOK  Emily Carr  by Rosemary Neering  Fitzhenry & Whiteside Ltd. 1975  One of a continuing series 'The  Canadians'.  Reviewed by Heather Kellerhals.  Though these short books - in this  case 61 pages - are designed for  school use, they are,of interest to  the general reader and may serve as  stepping stones to a more detailed  examination of the individual's life  and work.  I read Emily Carr with  great interest, relating what was in  it to the artist's own journals  Hundreds and Thousands (published by  Clarke Irwin, 1966) or some of her  other writings such as Klee Wyck.  Rosemary Neering writes well and  organizes her material clearly so  that a vivid portrait of Emily Carr,  the artist and person emerges. The  various influences on her artistic  development are noted; early trips  up the B.C. coast, art schools, voyage to France, meeting with the Group  of Seven. The author avoids most of  the pitfalls inherent in such a short  work and does not repeat the mistakes  seen in some of this series.  For  example, most of the questions asked  of the reader are relevant, although  I did find one rather surprising  query, "Can you think of any reasons  why she (Emily Carr) might have preferred animals to people?" I was glad  to find the questions at the end of  each chapter, instead of alongside  the text which was confusing. There  is a good selection and use of detail,  with the occasional lapse here and  there. For example why is it necessary to mention not once but several  times, Emily's intense dislike of a  certain Victoria family.  All in all an interesting book, containing many photographs of Emily Carr  and reproductions of her work. Read  it for yourself and give it to your  children.  BOOK  REVIEW  Loving Women  by the Nomadic Sisters, illust. by  Victoria Hammond. Available from  P.O. Box 793, Sonora, California  $3.50 plus 25c postage, or the  Women's Bookstore, Vancouver  Reviewed by win.  A beautifully illustrated and sensitively written sex manual by Lesbian  feminists.  Topics include "masturbation, vibrators, water play, penetration, environment, foreplay, oral sex and manual  stimulation".  It includes plenty of personal notes  like, "I guess there are a lot of  people who think lesbians just climb  on top of one another and pretend  they have penises." A great myth  dispeller.  "Women have not been encouraged to  feel good about their sexuality...Our  hope is to develop a sense of pride  in ourselves and one another and feel  good about all female sexuality."  "We thought it was time to expose the  joyous, natural side of loving women  and of sexual love between women."  A book by, for and about women - a  good healthy source of information to  promote understanding.  Good follow-  up to the more general discussion of  Lesbianism in "Our Bodies, Ourselves".

SCI—Fl  FEMINIST SCIENCE FICTION  THE WITCH AND THE CHAMELEON reviewed  by Ruth Dworin.  Do you read science fiction? Do you  find yourself frustrated by the stereo-  typically stupid roles women play in  most science fiction books written by  men, and, unfortunately, in many books  written by women? Have you been drawn  to the works of feminist writers such  .as Joanna Russ, Suzy McKee Charnas,  or Vonda Mclntyre? Are you looking  for good feminist analysis of science  fiction? Then perhaps its time you  discovered The Witch and the Chameleon,  Canada's (and perhaps the world's)  first and only feminist fanzine.  The Witch and the Chameleon, published  "irregularly" (three or four times a  year) contains fiction, poetry, graphics, book reviews, and numerous letters  to the editor. The latter often reveal  a fascinating dialogue between science  fiction writers about their politics.  The writing is consistently top-notch,  I particularly value the short storiest  Any of them can match or top the quality found in the average science fiction anthology or magazine: however,  in most of the stories the subject  matter is too radical (i.e. feminist)  for the average editor. If you are  interested in learning more about the  political motivations behind the books  /ou read, you can follow the ongoing  debate between Joanna Russ and Marion  Zimmer Bradley about their perceptions  of feminism that has spanned the last  several issues. If you want to find  Out about new science fiction books  by women writers, the review section  provides an excellent start; not only  does it include good feminist analysis  of books published, but the reviewers  themselves are often established writers. Also, the graphics and overall  layout of the magazine (especially  those in the recent double issue) are  superb.  Amanda Bankier has been quietly struggling in the wilds of Hamilton to produce this heroic effort singlehanded.  It's obvious that there is a great  need for a fanzine of this sort, as  she gets a lot of support from some  of the better-known women science  fiction writers. Articles by Joanna  Russ, Vonda Mclntyre, Kate Wilhelm,  Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Suzy McKee  Charnas, among others, appear in The  Witch and the Chameleon.  If you want to read this wonderful  magazine, you'll have to write to  Amanda, as it's not likely you'll  find it on your local newsstands.  Sample copies of back issues are 75c  (the recent double issue is $1.50 and  is highly recommended). A year's subscription is $4 (for three issues).  She also welcomes manuscripts and  graphics.

S.H.RARKE;  Olympics  OLYMPIC COVERAGE.SEXIST  During the Olympic Games the Vancouver  Status of Women joined Ttfomen across  Canada in protesting certain aspects  of the CBC coverage of the games.  Objections were voiced concerning  the lack of female sportscasters, the  use of the term 'girl' instead of  'woman' or sportswoman', and the final  outrage — Gary Lauten's "gluteus  maximum (sic) awards" where Lautens  gave awards to the breasts of female  competitors that most appealed to him.  Protest, was immediate — phone calls  to local and telegrams to local stations and CBC Toronto, and even small  demonstration in Toronto, Ottawa,  Montreal and Saskatoon.  A public apology was issued by CBC and  VSW received a letter from CBC president Johnson assuring us that "we  issued an apology to our audience and  instructions to our production teams  that no further lapses of taste such  as this item would be tolerated."  Secretary of State Hugh Faulkner wrote  that he "very much regretted that it  proved offensive to you and to other  viewers across the country, owing to  its manifestly sexist implications."

Telephone: 736-374*  THIS ISSUE :-  FRONT PAGE GRAPHIC: Kathy Horrocks  CONTRIBUTORS: Erin Williams, Karen  Richardson, Marion Barling, Nicola  Sumner, Janet Beebe, Molly Dexall,  Connie Smith, Angela Page, win,  Heather Kellerhals, Jo Lazenby  WORKERS THIS ISSUE: Janet Beebe,  Hiroshima Chakravarti, Jo Lazenby  EDITOR: Jo Lazenby  KINESIS:  In August's Kinesis' excerpts from  Hansard, Rosemary Brown said, "there  are a couple of other serious things  I wonder if you're looking at, and  that's the whole business of women  in prisons." As New Zealanders say,  "Good on you Rosemary".  And now I wonder if Ms. Brown would  also look at women in mental hospitals?  I have witnessed an assault  upon a young woman of eighteen by a  rough, intimidating male orderly in  the Intensive Care Unit at Crease.  So habitual and unwitting is the  sadistic behavior of certain members  of the staff they did not cover up  their behavior in the presence of  visitors.  I was told by the consulting psychiatrist, "I demand two males to each  female nurse in this unit." At the  time of my visit there were four  attendants for three frightened  patients, one of whom had had his  teeth knocked out; the two other  patients were women.  Alas, this fear of and planning for  violence—and for male nurses to  handle it, is unbecoming in a psychiatrist, shows lack of trust in his  patients, communicates itself to  stflff. The staff, we observed, acted  as jailers and indeed evoked fear and  violence in the patients. A young  woman locked in solitary in the unit  beat on the door and screamed all  during our visit one day. We were  told by an aide she had screamed all  night.  In a back issue of Kinesis, under  Policewoman Can Handle Violence, it  was stated that "women are less likely to resort to unnecessary force in  citizen encounters and are more likely to diffuse volatile situations".  The assault I witnessed was on a  pathetically frightened young woman  who had broken out of her solitary  (which, unlike prisons, does not have  a toilet).  If the nurse does not  respond to the patients beating on  the door—as has been documented in  Crease, the patient may resort to  urinating on the floor.  I would like Ms. Brown to investigate  psychiatric abuse. When Ms. Brown  was chairperson of the Legislature's  Select Standing Committee on Health,  Human Resources and Education, she  made no mention of mental patients.  Perhaps now that she has more time  for research she might rectify this  omission and start looking into the  status of the most neglected, most  mistreated, and most pathetic members  of our society—not prisoners, but  mental patients.  Therese Spitzer  KINESIS:  An article appears on Page 11 of the  July issue of KINESIS under the HANSARD  heading dealing with rug ranking in  the Civil Service.  Your readers will be interested to  know that to all intent and purposes  rug ranking has been abolished. Under  a banner headline in the Public Service Alliance of Canada newspaper  (May 1976) an announcement was made  that a two year agreement was reached  early in April of this year.  The agreement provided "for the much  talked about re-classification of secretaries to get rid of the rug ranking prevalent in the Federal Public  Service where secretaries were classified according to the work of their  bosses and not according to their  work." The agreement was made retroactive to January a2, 1976. It has  affected over 15,000 persons, most  of whom are women.  More information is available on this  subject from P.S.A.C., 233 Gilmore  St. Ottawa K2P 0P1.  Sincerely,  I.L. Mitchell (Mrs.)  Co-ordinator, Women's Employment,  Pacific Region.  KINESIS:  We have been in Calgary for 2 years  and even after all that time away  from Vancouver, I could not do without KINESIS. And I share the "magazine" with gals here*  Olivia Wilson  Calgary, Alberta.  KINESIS:  My August issue of Kinesis arrived  today and I note that two articles  look like free advertising.  I would  like to know your policy on this; I  refer to p. 5, "Women Need Insurance"  and p. 20, "CCEC".  If Ms. Gedroff is an insurance agent,  I think this should be indicated and  also it is your duty to edit her  article. That any of your staff could  allow the publication of that old myth  "women control 70% of the nation's  wealth" is incomprehensible to me;  inasmuch as it is proven on p. 22 of  The Report of the Royal Commission on  the Status of Women in Canada" that  women actually control about 20% of  the nation's wealth.  Also I would like to know what CCEC  stands for.  I have read the article  twice and can't unravel the secret.  Is it a secret?  Patricia M. Russell, Vancouver  Ms. Gedroff is indeed an insurance  agent. She inquired if KINESIS would  be interested in an article about  the need of women to insure themselves as men dO — to protect their  futures. I felt that it would be of  benefit to KINESIS readers to draw  attention to this topic and so printed the article. Ms. Gedroff has  offered to hold a workshop for women  to explain the need for insurance  and the various options.  As for the "women control 70% ...."  — you're quite right, it did slip  by me & is probably entangled with  the other old myth about spending  most of the money. I'll try harder.  A spokesperson for CCEC gives the  following explanation; " The CU  Charter from the Provincial Govern- Letters  cont'd  20  ment is in these initials. The  initials come from the name of the  original society which was the Community Congress for Economic Change.  The Credit Union grew out of this  society and exists seperately from  it. The CU has as its main aim the  providing of low cost credit to  those traditionally discriminated  against by the conventional credit  granting institutions. Enquiries  are welcome at the office, 125 East  8th, Vancouver. Phone: 876-0910."  As women and single parents are in  the above mentioned group I felt  the article would be of interest  to KINESIS readers.

Keep up the  good work.  Joyce Hamilton, Burns Lake  KINESIS:  In response to Geoffrey L. Riddebough,  the question may well be asked if the  cause of feminism is menaced by the  ignorant hysteria and lurid rhetoric  of men. I cannot answer Dr. Smith's  challenge for her, but I can comment  on the 'choice' Mr. Riddebough gives  women.  It is very curious that he perceives  only two choices open to women—to  accept men as fellow sufferers or to  regard them as "the enemy' . It seems,  somehow, a rather common patriarchal  offer. Has he never heard of separatism—a very sane and human position  whereby men are neither accepted or  fought against, but merely ignored?  Janice Summer  KINESIS  WHY CAN7T THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTAND  HOW IMPORTANT WOMEN'S CENTRES ARE??  As a volunteer at the Richmond Crisis  Centre I am only too aware that most  of the calls are from women.  These  women have problems with family, welfare, health, loneliness, and insecurity.  The list is endless!  These  women are not nagging and complaining,  they are scared and they need a place  to go where they can feel wanted,  make friends, and gain confidence.  This kind of support and the experience gained can only come from a  women's centre.  Not from a community centre, a crisis centre, or a  family centre.  This is why women's  centres are so vitally important.  Finally, we have a women's centre in  Richmond (The Richmond Women's Resource Centre), so before we lose it,  let's enjoy it and let's use it.

A combination of there not being  enough woman-hours in the day and  the flow of contributions dries up to  a trickle in the summer. But now that  we are heading into Fall (not that  we really had any Summer) I hope to  see articles, essays, humourous pieces,  personal experiences, ideas, whatever,  come pouring in.  If you would like to write something  for KINESIS, please do! It will make  the editor very happy, it will make  the readers very happy, and it will  make you happy too! Try it and see!
