Fourth/W    736-3746-7-6  Vpiumsv  ■mini ii   ,   No^  ;SD 0317-9095  An old friend called last week.  She first came to Status of Women two years ago in the middle  of a messy divorce.  She was over fifty. Her husband had left her.  Said she was too crazy  to live with. Maybe she wasn't totally straight-headed. He had been dating his secretary  for months. Her children blamed her for the divorce. Wouldn't even speak to her.  Then  the court registrar awarded her $200 a month maintenance.  This from a professional man she  had put- through school.  She hadn't worked outside her home for over thirty years. Had no  skills or special training.  She was a bit depressed.  After a few months, after talking to women in the same state of life, she began to try to  provide for herself.  Went to Langara for a basic business course.  Got a part time job.  Then last winter she got a full time job. Meanwhile her ex-husband left the country and  married his secretary. He never once paid her the $200 a month.  When she called last week, she said that her first evaluation on the full time job was  very bad. When she went home to think about it she had a mild stroke and has been in  and out of hospital for two months.  She said "All I want is to be independent.  I know  I have to be.  I'm trying so hard, but nothing is working".  This sounds like soap opera or bad novel or something.  But it really happened and I  cried when I hung up the phone. We must stop this waste and cruelty. Whatever happens  in legislatures or in schools, whatever our actions are, we must remember that this is  the heart of the women's movement. Women who embrace-a role that all the world approves  and urges them into, who willingly become dependent people are left.like this alone,  resourceless, nearly helpless.  It happens every day. And then they are roundly criticized  for not having planned better for the future. We are not finished until every woman can  do for herself when the need arises.  The answer to "WHY NOT?" must be "I'm trying so hard - but nothing is working yet."  Nancy Conrod  President, VSW trip to Ottawa  Ottawa_- July_3 and 4  On July 3 and 4, I joined four other  women from NAC in Ottawa for talks  with Marc Lalonde, Hugh Faulkner,  Katie Cooke and assorted M.P.s.  NAC's four major priorities for this  meeting were resolved at the NAC annual  meeting which was held in Winnipeg in  May. They were:  equal pay for work  of equal value; child care; birth control and abortion; and family and  property law.  Discussion with Lalonde  continued for two hours. He will  bring the equal pay questions up with  Mr. Munro (Labour minister).  In the  area of child-care, he feels they  "can't do more than we're doing  already." He feels that they are  already stretching the Canada Assistance Plan (subsidizes day-care for  families on welfare) as it is.  He  felt that the House of Commons was  lagging behind the rest of the country in its attitude to abortion, but  Lang apparently wants to review the  situation of the existing law and have  a debate to follow.  What has been  the hold up for the past three or  more years? The government feels that  simply removing abortion from the  criminal code stops short, that we  should be suggesting some kind of  positive legislative control to be  placed upon abortion. He acknowledged  the inequities of the present system  of family property law in the provinces,  but feels that it is not in the area  of federal legislation and that they  would face great uproar from the  provinces if they took the issue upon  themselves.  Friday morning we met for breakfast  with Gordon Fairweather, Flora MacDonald,  James McGrath (we had invited M.P.s  from our home constituencies - not all  were able to attend),  Stanley Knowles,  Aideen Nicholson, Monique Begin, Simma  Holt, Peter Stollery.  It was an informal discussion and it became very clear,  very quickly, where support was and  was not coming from.  From there we  went to the House of Commons. Lang  was answering questions from Diefenbaker  regarding legislation which arose from  the Morgentaler case.  Following this, we met with Hugh  Faulkner and his special assistant.  The discussion centred around funding --  how previous grant has been spent and  how future grants should be allocated.  Should he fund small regional women's  centres, or large national organizations such as NAC? We discussed the  resources presently funded by the  Secretary of State and expressed our  hope that adequate funding would be  continued after International Women's  Year.  ;  We then held a press conference - parts  of it were on the CBC National news  that evening.  Our last meeting was with Katie Cooke,  chairperson of the Advisory Council.  We reviewed for her the things we had  done and the reactions we had received.  The action NAC suggests to follow this  meeting:  1) meetings with local MPs re: resolutions and responses we received in  Ottawa. Ask for action!  2) pressure MPs and Faulkner for the  passage of Bill C-20  3) emphasize to Faulkner the importance  of his department's funding  Though we attempted to bring our issues  into focus, there were certainly no  promises made. There was buck-passing  onto provincial governments and  evasiveness of issues.  It remains  to be seen what will happen and it  requires a continuous push from women  across Canada to make those important  legislative changes happen.  - Miriam Cropper  we got it  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMME  FOR MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES  Shelagh Day of the B.C. Human Rights  Branch requested a public representation before City Council to present  the case for an Equal Employment Opportunities Programme for municpal  employees.  The Vancouver Status of  Women made a similar request. While  fully supporting the two motions concerning the Human Rights Code —  committment to its provisions and a  general review of hiring and promotion  practices — we take the position  that an E.E.O.P. is imperative. On  July 22, 1975, Vancouver City Council  voted unanimously for the adoption o#  such a scheme.  The following is the Vancouver Status  of Women Brief on Equal Employment  Opportunities Programme:  The Vancouver Status of Women, in its  concern for the equality of all workers, wishes to propose that the City  of Vancouver establish an Equal Opportunities Programme.  We strongly support the resolutions  adopted by the Standing Committee on  Community Services regarding the British Columbia Human Rights Code. Indeed,  it is important that the City make a  public committment to its provisions.  While Human Rights Legislation does  prohibit discrimination in terms of  salary levels, hiring and promotion  practices, the code does not provide  the mechanisms to fully examine all  of the discriminatory aspects in a  place of employment. So far as the  individual is concerned, Human Rights  Legislation can only deal with discrimination after the fact.  An Equal Employment Opportunities Pro  gramme would have the mandate to fully  examine the employment structure. This  would involve an analysis of representation of women, minority and handicapped persons in each department and department level, salary scales, hiring  practices, definition of merit, skills,  and job categories. Utilizing this information, a plan of action can be  formulated. Equal Employment Opportunities Programmes usually involve the  setting of particular objectives in  each departmento This can involve  training programmes, re-structuring  of positions, special encouragement  to disadvantaged groups, and on-going  examination of progress. An important  element of such a scheme is that the  onus is placed upon the employer to  deal directly with all discriminatory  practices, and give proof of its  achievement.  Several models for Equal Employment  Opportunities Programmes exist. We  believe that it is imperative that  such a programme be separate and apart  from the personnel department. Such a  programme must have a director responsible to a council committee and a full  time staff. They would be responsible  for research and the assistance of  department heads. An advisory committe  would be struck with appropriate representation.  The Federal Government of Canada has  instituted such a programme and several provinces, and the Toronto Mayor's  Task Force on the Status of Women are  committed to such programmes. It is  imperative that all levels of government be exemplary in assuring equal  opportunities for all workers. Hopefully the adoption of such a scheme  would be an encouragement to the private sector to follow suit.  - Glinda Sutherland  affirmative  action  The women of the United Church in  B.C. have passed a resolution in  support of provincial affirmative  action legislation and are also in  the process of setting up an affirmative action plan for lay women and  clergy in their church. Their Outreach  Committee, headed by Daphne Anderson,  is working on C-R Workshops to examine  the role of women in the church and  feminist theology. The committee is  calling for letters of support of their  efforts, to be directed to Reverend  Art Anderson, Executive Secretary of  the B.C.

Recently a judge in an Ontario rape  trial voiced the opinion that there  is so much free sex available that  a man would have to be almost out of  his mind to resort to rape. He also  censured women hitch-hikers, declaring that while he did not excuse the  rapist's actions "if women and girls  were more circumspect, there would  be fewer sexual crimes."  If we are frightened and angered by  the attitude revealed by these statements — we should be! They reveal  that this "man of justice" believes  many of the basic myths surrounding  the crime of rape — eg:  MYTH: the rapist is a sexually unfunfilled man carried away by a sudden  uncontrollable surge of desire.  REALITY: a group of convicted rapists  at Mountain Prison who were involved  in a series of discussions with wc  men from Vancouver Rape Relief confirmed that rape is a crime of  aggression. The desire is to intimidate, subdue, master — not to obtain sexual gratification.  Some of  the men said they had wanted their  victim to struggle.  In our society  a man's manhood and sexuality are  very closely tied to aggressive behaviour. We are socialized this way—  men as victors, women as victims. The  prisoners also felt that nothing was  being done to alter these attitudes  while they were in prison.  An American doctor has released a  study involving a group of convicted  rapists in which he maintains that  the motive for rape is not sexual  pleasure.  In his study, 50% of the  men had not achieved orgasm during  rape, and 75% had had wives or girlfriends with whom they were having  sexual relations regularly.  MYTH: most rapes occur in back alleys  or to women who hitchhike.  REALITY: in the Greater Vancouver  area about 80% of rapes are casual  acquaintance rapes; approximately 5%  are rapes of women who are hitchhiking.  Another popular myth, not mentioned  by the judge, is that women fantasize  about rape and, as men are often heard  to say, "really want it." Marcia H.  Rioux states in her discussion paper  '"When Myths Masquerade as Reality: A  Story of Rape," prepared for the  Advisory Council on the Status of  Women, April, 1974, " The very idea  that a woman could enjoy being attacked, that she could enjoy being exposed to injury or death, that she could  enjoy being treated in a humiliating  and brutal fashion is preposterous."  Everyone has sexual fantasies, but  rape is a violent, totally unromantic  assault.  Rape is the fastest growing crime in  our society—and it is the most under-  reported one.  In Vancouver 200 rapes  were reported between May 1974 and  May 1975. Police estimate that this  represents about 10% of the rapes  committed during that period. They  say that if 10 of every 100 rapes are  reported, 4 or 5 will go to trial,  and 1.5 will result in conviction.  The legal procedure is so lengthy —  3 to 6 months before a preliminary  hearing, then perhaps another year  before the trial; the entire expert  ience is so traumatic and humiliating;  the sense of shame that society forces  the victim of this crime to assume  is so strong that it is not surprising that only 10% of rapes are reported.  There is obviously great need for  BAPC  changes in attitudes regarding rape  and in legislation dealing with the  crime.  In September 1974, Justice  Minister Otto Lang announced his intention of presenting to Parliament  proposed changes in the Criminal Law  relating to trials for rape, necessay  to "...protect the victim from the  acute embarrassment and harassment  that often attend the report of a rape  under our present system."  Mr. Lang presented his proposed changes  to the National Conference of Rape  Crisis Centres held June 20-22 in Ottawa and attended by representatives  of 22 rape crisis centres from across  Canada.  It was understood by the Conference that these amendments would  be introduced in the House of Commons  in the fall.  However among the amendments to the  Criminal Code introduced in the Commons  July 17 by the Minister of Justice,  were several dealing with rape and related sexual offences. The changes  would make it easier to gain a change  of venue for rape trials and prohibit  publication of the identity of the  victim when an application is made by  the prosecution. Evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct would be  permitted only at the discretion of  the judge and only if reasonable  notice in writing is given. Either  the accused or the prosecution would  be able to apply to the judge to close  the court to the public.  Representatives from Vancouver Rape  Relief £oint out that these terms already exist in case law — at the discretion of the judge. And. the media  has generally been good about not publishing the names of victims in rape  trials. However,, by making the case  laws statues it would put more onus  on the trial judge to introduce them  into the proceedings.  The most important amendment introduced  by Mr. Lang is the elimination of the  rule of corroboration. The Criminal  Code (sec. 142) requires that in a  trial for rape or indecent assault,  if the only evidence that implicates  the accused is the evidence of the  female complainant, and that evidence  is not corroborated in a material  particular by evidence that implicates  the accused, the judge must "instruct  the jury that it is not safe to find  the accused guilty in the absence of  such corroboration, but that they are  entitled to find the accused guilty  if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence is true."  Evidence of torn clothing, bruises,  screams and especially the distressed  condition of the victim (as reported  by others) may or may not be capable  of furnishing corroboration in law.  Whether it is or not will depend on  the facts of each case. Whether a  given item of evidence satisfies the  basic characteristics of corroborat*  ive evidence is a question of law  which is up to the judge to decide.  If he accepts it as capable of being  corroborative, he then leaves it to  the jury to decide whether or not  corroborative inferences should in  fact be drawn from such evidence.  This present requirement of corroboration puts the character of the complainant in issue in a trial. Rape  must be the only crime in which the  victim is on trial!  Members of the rape crisis centres  would like to see more far-reaching  changes made in legislation dealing  with rape. They want the word "rape"  removed from the Criminal Code altogether.  They feel that the crime  should be classed as an assault — a  crime against a person. The "moral  judgements involved in the (present)  law are made evident by the fact  that by legal definition, rape can  only be perpetrated by a male person  against a female person.  If forcible  sexual acts and humiliation are illegal  then they must be considered illegal  and unacceptable wherever and against  whomsoever they are enacted. Under  these conditions, the concept of a  male person raping a male person or  a female person raping a male person  would be legally possible." (Marcia H.  Rioux).  At present the sexual intercourse  involved in the crime is considered  more important than the physical  assault. There are degrees of assault  and if a rape were treated as an  assault case there would be a much  greater chance of conviction. The  present allowable maximum penalties  for rape (eg. forcible rape: life)  are out of proportion to the crime  and, are a deterrent to conviction.  In reality convicted rapists rarely  receive more than five years. For  example, the rape trial mentioned  in the opening paragraph resulted  in a sentence of 2 years less a day  definite and 2 years less a day indeterminate in a reformatory.  During the month of August representatives of rape crisis centres across  Canada, including Vancouver Rape Relief, will be meeting in committees  to draw up a brief outlining the  changes they would like to see in  legislation dealing with rape.  Vancouver Rape Relief, 1027 West  Broadway, would appreciate copies of  any correspondence concerning rape.  Vancouver Rape Relief has been in  operation since April 1974 and receives  funding from the provincial Department  of Health. At present they have  6 full-time paid staff and approximately 30 non-paid volunteers. Workers take a 6 week training course  entailing court, police and hospital  procedures,and medical followup as  well as role playing and discussion  groups. The crisis line operates on  a 24 hour a day basis (732-1613) and  the centre provides counselling,  accompaniment service to police,  hospital, court,etc., referrals to  medical services, information and  aan file a third party report if the  victim does not wish to prosecute.  The victim's name will not be used  but the information is helpful to the  police in identifying repeating rap**-  ists and/or suspects. They provide  support for the woman who has just  been raped — whether or not she decides to report the rape. They also  provide counselling and rap sessions  for women who have been raped in the  past. Members of the centre regularly give talks to groups of policemen,  studentsjetc and are hoping to organize a course for policemen similar to  the one in Los Angles on how to deal  with rape victims.  If you are interested in working with Rape Relief,  a new training program begins in  September.  - Jo Lazenby The IWY Van is on the road in B.C.!  The mobile information unit is being  driven by Sheila Purdy of Vancouver  Status of Women, and Gillian Smith  of Everywoman's Bookstore in Victoria.  The program is funded by the federal  government and Lynne Pearson is the  B.C. Coordinator of the IWY Secretariat and the program contact person  and organizer.  Sheila and Gillian have been on the  road since early June and feel that  their work falls into three general  divisions which overlap and interact  with one another:  . they provide information on  federal and provincial services, legislation, and legal rights of men  and women  . they collect information on  issue, experiences, problems that  affect B.C. women  . they try to help women link up  with other women in the province-  Following are excerpts from a letter  from Sheila Purdy somewhere out there!  "Hello at long last.  There is a lot  to say so I think the best plan would  be for me to first explain the kind  of display,that people are seeing  Our co-ordinator Lynne Pearson, has  gone out to most of the communities  before we do. We have learned that  the most successful public displays  are those where we are on a main street  between the hours of 11 am and 4 pm  and where Lynne and the women she has  contacted have done some advertising.  The display — basically people are  seeing a table overflowing with federal and provincial government materials that relate to women.  As people start to browse, we inform  them of who we are, that this is part  of Canada's programme for IWY? that  they are welcome to take copies of  most of the literature on the table  and that we have information on specific issues (listed on a poster) if  they are interested or have a specific problem.  The next stage is for us to find out  a bit about the person and we ask  general questions hoping to hit on  one or two subjects that the person  feels ase important.  If she talks  about day care for example, or employment, education, housing, etc. as  issues that are important to her, we  document the details.  If possible,  we try to let her know that some positive steps re. the status of women  are being made and talk in particular  about Gene Errington's job, Eileen  Caner's branch, Reva Dexter's position, the Human Rights Branch, etc.  If the woman is already tuned in to  the women's movement, then we talk  more about women's groups, WCWN, etc.  Getting women interested in the recommendations of the working group  on matrimonial property is another  priority.  Now I should tell you what issues  are turning up again and again.in  small towns. Day care, I feel, is  going to emerge as the number one  priority of young women in B.C.,  regardless of their interest in the  status of women. Let me give some  examples:  . Port Alberni is a one-industry  town, with MacMillan Bloedel employing.most of the working population.  The majority of jobs are shift-work.  They began employing women lh  years  ago. One young woman, a single parent, works in the mill and so must  on the road  employ a babysitter.  The mill job  pays well but out of her $700 net  pay, she spends approximately $350  on day care and babysitting payments.  In other words, the financial advantage to working in a non-traditional  occupation is nullified by having to  use two types of child care.  Her  priority,then, is to have 24 hour  child care.  . Women elsewhere who would like  to work, feel that they could not  afford the child care costs, especially if they can only get shiftwork jobs. This applies not only to  most industry jobs but also to nursing, and waitressing.  . One woman in Cranbrook, a  single parent, works as a waitress  Friday nights and Saturdays. The day  care centre there is open Monday to  Friday 9 to 6. At the moment friends  take the child overnight on Fridays  but this is only a temporary arrangement and apparently Cranbrook is very  short on babysitters.  Our files are filling up with similar  stories.  A lot of people, women of all ages,  are picking up the brochure on  apprenticeship training. Young girls  we are talking to do not realize that  these courses are open to women.  Of  course we ate  quick to point out that  women are sometimes discouraged from  enrolling and must therefore be persistent.  Employment opportunities  in general are very limited in small  urban areas that we have visited.  But it is also true that few women  consider trying to get employment in  the major industry in their town.  Some do not know that women are being  allowed into 'non-traditional' occupations in mills and smelters.  Others would like to work but not  in that kind of employment.  We toured Cominco fei Trail.  Our  guide, a man who had worked for Com*-  inco for 40 years, told us that during the war women worked in nearly  all areas of the smelter, and, in his  estimation, were as competent as men  in all the operations. At present,  44 out of 3,700 employees at Cominco  are women.  Many women are still not aware that  they can take action against an employer who discriminates on the basis  of sex.  So far we have referred  three or four women to the Human  Rights Branch of B.C. One Comox woman  who works as a cleaner in the hospital, believes that her job is substantially the same as the male janitors'  work but is paid less because of a  lifting requirement written into the  janitors' job description.  The most popular pamphlets in our  display are 'Women and the Law'.  They are being bought up as quickly  as we can get them. Women's groups  find that conducting sessions on  "Women and the Law" attracts a lot  of women in the community.  In the first three weeks of our tour  we were able to set up displays and  show films in eight schools, on Vancouver Island and in the Princeton  and Grand Forks areas.  Teachers and  students are responding enthusiastic  ally to the Women's Kit, with the result that many schools are planning  to purchase the Kit on their own or  in conjunction with the public li±-  brary and the established women's  groups in town, such as the Business  and Professional Women's Club or the  Women's Institute.  Thus far we have  heard of two cases where girls have  been denied entrance into woodworking  courses in the high schools.  In Cranbrook a girl was told by the principal  that having a girl in the woodworking  class would distract the boys, which  could lead to accidents with the mach-  inesy and therefore, it was the school'  board's policy to refuse girls entry  to the course.  Such cases are being  referred to the Department of Education's Consultant on Sexism in Public  Education.  Apart from public displays and school  events, we are also invited to conduct workshops or participate in discussions. We have given workshops in  Courtenay, Port Alberni, Nanaimo,  Trail, Cranbrook, Grasmere, and Fernie,  usually in conjunction with the women's  group in the area.  In these workshops  we have made use of the slide show on  jobs for women provided by Manpower.  At this point we feel that public displays are the most immediate means  of reaching the uninvolved and those  who will not come out to a public  meeting.  The women's groups with whom we have  made contact are proving to be our  greatest support and we are trying  in return to give them some encouragement and ideas on how they can expand  their operation or simply keep from  folding. Women's groups in small  towns are faeed with two major problems.  One is that there ace not usually enough women to warrant more  than one group.  Therefore, it is  crucial to their survival that women  of different ideologies or priorities  be able to work together.  Secondly,  attracting new members in a small  town is especially difficult after  the first wave, and original members  find that they are ready to go on  with their own lives after a few years.  Going back to school means that much  less time can be devoted to the wo»  men's group.  Our coordinator is finding that as  she sets up activities for us in very  small places, women's groups such  as the Women's Institute and the B«C  W.C. are responding very well.  We did make it to the Kaslo Festival  and that was fun! Gillian and I made  it a time for relaxing. Right now I  am completely zonked, as you can tell  from this letter."

Avis Rosenberg. farm and domestic Workers  On April 10, 1975, the Select Standing  Committee on Labour and Justice tabled  its report on Farm and Domestic Workers, recommending the inclusion of  these two classes of workers in provincial protective labour legislation.  Since that time, the B.C. Labour Code  has been amended and we hope that by  the fall these workers will be afforded  protection under the Maternity Protection Act, the Payment of Wages Act,  the Truck Act, the Employment Agencies  Act, the Control of Employment of  Children Act, the Workers Compensation  Act, the Annual and General Holidays  Act, the Hours of Work Act and the  Minimum Wage Act.  In our own brief  (October 31, 1974) to the Select Standing Committee and support paper (May,  1975) for the recommendations we pointed  out that exclusion of these two categories of workers is indeed contrary  to the philosophy of such legislation^  and contributes to their deplorable  working conditions, job insecurity  and low wages.  A particular concern of Status of Women  is the plight of women domestics who  enter Canada on working visas.  While  we do not excuse the province for its  failure in this area, we believe that  the Federal Government Department of  Manpower and Immigration has been a  leading offender in allowing the gross  exploitation of these workers.  Individual employers and employment  agencies must make application to  Canada Manpower for work permits.  The work permit sets out hours of  work, days of work, duties, salary  and living accommodation.  One Canada  Manpower official told me that the  minimum salary for which it can issue  a permit is $ 180 per month, while  another said the base rate is $ 200.  An official stated that although he  personally would only issue a permit  at a minimum rate of $ 250, "this  would vary from counsellor to counsellor."  slavery  The employee must present the permit  to an Immigration Official upon entry  into the country - for rubber stamping.  I was told by one official that they  are "not interested" in the working  conditions of these people.  Supposedly,  where the prospective employee is  interviewed by an immigration official  in her home country, the official will  explain the provisions of the visa.  But one must balance this with the  glowing stories of life in Canada that  are presented to these women by recruiting agencies in the home country.  For example, one woman was led to  believe that she would be able to make  application for landed immigrant status and bring her whole family to  Canada.  Clearly, from her discussion  with the agency, she had no idea what  a pittance $ 200 is in Canada. We  recognize the fact that many of these  "agency promises" are verbal, but we  believe that the Department of Immigration should be scrupulously moni-.  toring such practices and insuring  that employees know exactly what their  status within Canada will be. Unfortunately, V.S.W. cannot obtain copies  of Department of Immigration regulations which might afford some protection where a written promise has been  made between employer and employee.  A few examples of domestic working  situations follow:  1. A woman had been promised $ 250  per month but only received $ 200.  She worked five days a week for  ten hours a day. On her two days  off, she was given nothing to eat.  2. A woman worked seven days a week  with only two one-half days  off.  For the five days she  worked ten hours a day. Her  agency had promised her $ 250 per  month but she was only receiving  $ 225.  3. A woman received $ 240 per month  and her room and board was deducted  from her salary.  It is also standard policy that the  cost of a woman's return air fare is  deducted from her salary.  And for all this there is really no  recourse. People fear leaving their  positions as their visas would become  void.  Finding a similar job is not  a solution for there is no guarantee  that conditions will improve. Technically these people are not eligible  to receive Canada Manpower counselling  services.  Complaints can be made to  Manpower regarding wages, with Manpower  approaching the employer, however,  it was repeated to me that Canada-  Manpower is not an enforcement agency  and certainly cannot enforce the hours  of work provisions. Finally, CM.  affords these women absolutely no job  protection, so by filing a complaint,  the employee risks being firedo.-,  Manpower is closing its eyes to a form  of slavery. The federal government  is engaged in a special agreement with  the government of Jamaica that even  facilitates the recruiting of women  for these ugly positions.  But women  from all over the world are arriving  in our country to be subjected to the  worst of working conditions.  If work permits continue to be issued,  the Federal Government must establish  clear policy and protection to these  workers.  Guidelines must comply with  federal minimum standards where provincial labour legislation does not  exist and these must be fully enforced.  - Glinda Sutherland  pregnant   flight    attendants  Pacific Western Airlines has been  found not guilty by B.C. Provincial  Judge Douglas Reid of contravention  of Section 59.4 of the Canada Labour  Code. The section states that a woman who has worked for 12 consecutive  months cannot be laid off solely because she is pregnant. Judge Reidl  felt that the flight attendants in  the case were laid off for reasons  of safety.  He felt that PWA's most  impressive witnesses were two flight  attendants who had been involved in  a plane crash. At a later time both  women had been pregnant and felt that  they could not have performed as well  had they been pregnant at the time  of the emergency.  Under cross-examination, both stated that they didn't  think that a pregnant woman or a woman with, children should be working  at any job. That particular point  didn't carry much weight with the  judge.  The judge also maintained that the  reason CALFAA's (Canadian Airlines  Flight Attendants Association)  collective agreement states that  women will take a leave of absence  (voluntarily or forcibly) is because  Of PWA's "concern for safety". The  Canada Labour Code states clearly  that its provisions hold precedent  over any collective agreement if the  labour code is more beneficial to the  employee.  The judge maintained that  PWA does not have a history of discrimination (why didn't'they hire  married women until a few years ago?)  and its prime concern was safety.  One questions their sincerity when  it is understood that the first three  months of pregnancy are the mpst critical, whereas the fourth month is the  time when a woman begins to show that  she is pregnant. Why isn't safety a  factor up to that point?  The ramifications of this case go  farther than the issue of whether a  flight attendant should or should  not work. Once a precedent is set,  and the provisions of the Labour Code  are disregarded, there is nothing to  stop every other industry from following suit, effectively negating the  federal maternity protection.  CALFAA and VSW have contacted Labour  Minister John Munro, Justice Minister  Otto Lang, and Minister reponsible  for the Status of Women Marc Lalonde  asking for an appeal or a new trial  in the case. This case has gone on  for a year already—it looks as though  it will continue for a long time.  - Miriam Gropper  NEWS  An adviser on Indian women's activities has been appointed by the federal  Department of Indian Affairs. Ms. Van  Every-Albert, a Cayuga Indian from the  Six Nations Reserve near Brantford,  Ontario, will work with nearly 200  band-level women's groups across Canada to acquaint them with programs  and resources available and to assist  them in maintaining contact with each  other, as well as publicizing their  activities.

Away from a crowded, polluted city,  noisy traffic - pressures and a demanding four year old child. Well, it  happened. One whole week at Hollyburn  Mountain.  It was a single parent's  retreat and even the doctor couldn't  have recommended anything better.  Transportation was provided to and  from the mountain. Along with two of  the organizers I stayed in a cabin  which is part of Westlake Lodge. This  was quite an experience in itself.  It was a thoroughly relaxing and ex-  hilerating week away from everything.  No routines. No tension. No alarm  clock to shake you out of a dreamy  sleep.  It was just so nice to wake  up and hear the birds chirping instead  of the C.N. trains, which is what I  live next to. And no screeching cars.  Just to be able to lie in bed with  no one telling you it's time to get  up. The fresh air is something else!  There, when you take a deep breath  .you get high just from the crisp.cool  air. We slept on foam mattresses on  the floor in our sleeping bags. The  fireplace was on a great deal of the  time as it was pretty chilly first  thing in the morning and at night.  Parents' Retreat is for parents on  social assistance or low-income.  If  you wish, you can swim, hike, sun  bathe, canoe, do crafts, read, listen  to music or simply sit back and relax.  Parents must arrange babysitting for  their children for the five days but  if this does not seem possible, you  can call Parents' Retreat as the staff  may be able to help you work something  out.  A contribution of $ 10 for food  is all that's requested. This retreat  operates from Monday to Friday until  the end of August. There is accommodation for about a dozen people each  week.  If Parents' Retreat interests  you, the number to call is 731-5727,  local 211 to find out more about it.  I'm sure glad I phoned!  - Kathy Horrocks  laws   insufficient  "... the fact remains that where women  only are employed, equal pay laws are  irrelevant and cannot contribute in  any way to the improvement of women's  pay," states the recently published  1974 report of the Women's Bureau,  Labour Canada.  The report points out that occupational  segregation by sex is increasing since  the earliest equal pay legislation  was enacted. Sex-typed job ghettos  may be a way for employers to avoid  complying with equal pay laws. In  other words, women won't get equal  pay until they have equal work.  What are the drawbacks of current  equal pay legislation? They are often  under the jurisdiction of both provincial and federal governments thus  sometimes conflicting.  At the same time, weak penalties for  violations of the law do not persuade  employers to pay women equally. Many  enforcement agencies are not fully  empowered to inspect for contraventions  and can only react to individual complaints.  Therefore, the burden of proof of discrimination in employment often rests  with the individual woman who may be  ignorant of protective laws and therefore not fight for her rights; who may  fear reprisal from the employer if she  does lodge a complaint; and who may  well be unable to afford a lengthy  court battle.-  Also, a case won by one woman will not  improve the status of thousands of  other women who are similarly discriminated against. What is the answer? The Women's Bureau report suggests that affirmative action plans  are one direction to take.  In the meantime, the Women's Bureau  report predicts that, "...a high unemployment rate at a time of continuing  inflation may well bring an unfavourable reaction.  It is still too early  to hope that the long standing practice  of hiring women last and firing them  first will be reversed in the time of  economic depression."  Will we all have to go back to the  kitchen again?  - Karen Richardson  VSW Board of Directors  Member-at-Large  socio-economic  profile  The Women's Economic Rights Branch,  B.C.

These phenoxies have been found to  work directly on the endocrine  system of rats causing frightening  birth defects.  Humans are even  more succeptible to phenoxy  herbicides than rats.  Furthermore,  even though the use of DDT, DDA,  DDE and Dieldrin was banned between  1969 and 1972 we have retained  traces in our fatty tissues. Dr. S  Stanton Maxey of Florida states that  these herbicides are carcinogenic.  When he removed a cancerous breast  from a female patient her fat  tissue showed the presence of  Silvex, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, DDT, DDA, DDE  and Dieldrin. He concludes  "Since current animal work indicates  that herbicides (eg. 2,4,5,-T)  in combination with organic  pesticides (eg. Dieldrin) are up  to four times as toxic as either  agent alone I feel, until proven  otherwise, my patient's cancer was  caused by these agents".  In a recently released report of  an inquiry on environment held in  California in June 1974, Dr. Diane  Courtney, Chief of Toxicology,  Environmental Protection Agency,  National Environmental Research  Centre, Research Triangle Park, N.C.  was asked by Senator Tunney: "From  what you suggested, even with parts  they cannot measure of dioxin, that  it can produce fetal damage?" Dr.  Courtney answerd "Yes."  If you would like more information,  a speaker for your group or are  interested in becoming involved in  a group to combat the use of these  . dangerous phenoxy herbicides contact:  Merriam Doucet - #24, 3313 Dewdney  Trunk Road, Port Moody, 936-6492. ?2^RAILROADINGtt22^^  A while ago we heard that the C.N.R.  had announced that a study would be  done regarding the Status of Women -in  the C.N.R. as a basis for a plan -  of action to implement integration  of female employees into significant  roles in management.  This study was  done by Boyle Kirkman Associates of  New York, a consulting firm apparently well experienced in this  particular field.  Beginning last August, the consultants  interviewed a number of managers  and female employees in selected  locations to identify the concerns  and problems.  A meeting was held  with top management at which the  problems identified would be reviewed in order to make a decision  on a plan of action. The final stage,  just beginning, consists of development and implementation of the  plan based on the decisions taken.  We have been pressuring CN to  make this study public, not only  because CN is a crown corporation  and as such should be setting an  example for private industry,  but because it would offer those of  us committed to Affirmative Action  legislation an excellent opportunity  to monitor%n important first step  forward. Communication was received  from the Minister of Transport's  office stating that, "the CNR is not  at liberty to publish the report of  the study completed by their consultants. . .they, Boyle, Kirkman  Associates, take strong objection  to releasing this report in its  entirety because it contains  proprietary information which  could be useful to their competitors  or potential competitors."  We were sent instead a copy of the  CN employee newspaper for April/75  tnac contains an article about the  study and this summary of that .  article will have to suffice for  now.- Stay tuned for further  developments though!  The Boyle Kirkman study found that *  although 1/3 of the Canadian labour  force was female, only 4% of CN's  work force was female, and less than  % of 1% was holding jobs at the senior  management level. The study also  disclosed a lack of expressed  committment on the part of executive  management generally to improve the  status of women in the company; an  unconscious bias among the majority  of managers which would foster  discriminatory actions in respect  of promotion or the full utilization  of the capabilities of female  employees; and deficiencies in  personnel systems and procedures  in relation to the recruitment,  promotion and development of female  employees.  According to the report, "CN's  managers are unaware of executive  management's interest and concern  on the women's issue.  Clearly, top  management must recognize that  the motivation to change must be  created through executive directive."  Specifically, CN's executive  management needs to (1) get  involved in demonstrating their  commitment and in measuring their  managers on progress against  pre-set goals, and (2) require  that each major department define  their own specific problems,  develop detailed programs for  solving them and set concrete  targets for line managers to  achieve. ,  Employee relations officers from  across the CN system have already  met to review personnel systems in  order to improve identification,  training and promotion of female  employees and in March of 1975  the first awareness training  seminar for senior officers was  held. These seminars are conducted by Boyle Kirkman staff  who feel that the ideal situation  would be that upon completion  of the seminar participants  should (1) understand their own  behaviour by having had an  opportunity to bring out, discuss  and analyze their own attitudes  towards women in CN, (2) understand the changing role of women  , and discuss the advantages and  problems for CN, (3) understand  how to manage and motivate women  within their own areas more  effectively, and (4) develop  strategies to better utilize women  within each of their own  departments.  Awareness seminars will also be  held for women employees, hopefully  enabling them to (1) eliminate some  of the inner blocks to progress,  (2) learn about and plan to take  opportunities for advancement,  and (3) prepare themselves to fill  those positions and cope with  new pressures.  We will, in the near.future, contact  some of the women involved in this  program within the CNR and talk  to them about their feelings about  this kind of affirmative action  program.  -Diana Bissell  (Most material here gathered from  Evelyn Leblanc's article in the  April/75 issue of "Keeping Track",  Employee Communications Branch,  P.R. Dept, CNR, P.O. Box 8100,  Montreal)  — advisory     council  The second annual meeting of the federal Advisory. Council on the Status  of Women was held in Ottawa June 9,  10 and 11.  Four new members appointed to the 30-  member council were present. The new  member from B.C. is Norrie Preston  of Victoria.  Marc Lalonde, Minister responsible  for the Status of Women, attended  briefly and told the members he was  hopeful that the Omnibus Bill, C-16,  would be given third reading in the  House of Commons later this week.  A request was made that the Minister  of Indian Affairs, Judd Buchanan, be  made aware of ACSW's stand that nonstatus Indian women and their: children should not be evicted from reserves  while discussions on revisions to the  Indian Act are proceeding between the  federal Government and the National  Indian Brotherhood.  Labour Minister John Munroe was asked  to make a public statement in support  of the Canada Labour Code provision  prohibiting the dismissal of pregnant  employees.  A statement on the rights and responsibilities of spouses to each other  in marriage was accepted unanimously  by the members.  It emphasizes the  principles of equality and shared  responsibility, including the recognition of unpaid work within the family as being as vital as paid work  outside the family.  A paper on rape recommended fundamental changes in the law respecting rape  and related sexual offences.  The ACSW recommended that the CBC be  asked to reconsider its refusal to  permit use of birth planning information. The federal government was requested to subsidize and assess information programs and set up federal-  provincial mechanisms for the distribution of birth planning information.  guide  "Federal Services for Women" is a  guide to federal programs, services,  and grants of interest to women,  published by Information Canada.

This month we would like to draw  attention to the Royal Commission  Report's Recommendation # 152.  "WE RECOMMEND THAT THE WORDS OF  PREVIOUSLY CHASTE CHARACTER BE  DELETED FROM ALL SECTIONS OF THE  CRIMINAL CODE"."  The Report well points out the  injustice of introducing the  moral character of the victim  in defining a crime, that in  four sections of the Criminal  Code the presumption of chaste  character of a female (up to  21 years of age) before the offence  is basic to the interpretation of  the offence and that, very often a  young woman is forced into the  position of having to defend her  "virtue" before a court.  To demands at the National Conference  of Rape Crisis Centres in July, that  references to "previously chaste  character" be removed from the  Criminal Code the Minister of Justice  responded that he would "look into it."  When you are writing to support re-  form^in laws relating to assault (see  article p.17) make sure that the Minister does "look into this" and press  him to take the needed action. Write  to Hon.

In fact, in 1972 only 4.2% of women,  compared with 12.6% of men, held managerial or executive positions.  Judged on these statistics, tradition*?  ally considered "men's roles" which  offer high status, high responsible  ity and high income still appear to  be generally out of reach for women.  Is this due to discrimination against women by male-dominated executive  ranks, or is it due to women's own  self-concept of what her role in life  should be? One must answer yes to  both parts of this question for I  believe it is the traditional attitudes of society that have caused  both external and internal discrim-'r  ination against women advancing in  the business world.  Women, and indeed girls, have been  both openly and covertly discouraged  from even aspiring to managerial/  executive positions.  Business aspirations have not been considered normal  for women and therefore, by virtue of  social pressure alone, most girls have  not braved the loneliness experienced  by women at the "top" or the stigma  which society attaches to the "busi*  ness woman" whom it suspects is  necessarily unfeminine. Girls have  been encouraged,on the Other hand,  to believe that marriage and motherhood are normal and that women should  fulfill the accepted female role of  wife and mother exclusively.  Another important discouraging factor  has been the erroneous belief that  women are biologically unsuitable for  high pressure jobs which demand above  average intelligence and motivation.  This attitude has affected the coun*  selling of girls in terms of how much  and what kinds of education they  should acquire. By under-rating their ,  potential and by under-educating themselves women have been channelled  into female sex-typed jobs (i.e. nursing, teaching, secretarial).  It has  been a matter of demotivation or a  stifling of career expectations from  girlhood.  Fortunately, attitudes are changing  and,whether it is by choice or by  need, a few women are shedding the  old self-concepts and aspiring to careers in the male domains. The major  attitudinal change is women's awakened awareness of their own potential  and of their own realistic desire for  self-fulfillment through a career or  through combining a career with marriage and motherhood..  And what about the myth of definitive  male/female characteristics which has  caused sex-typing and discrimination  in jobs?  In her book, Women in the  Public Interest, sociologist Dr.  Jessie Bernard discusses in detail  the nature of inner differences and  similarities between men and women  and among women themselves. She  states "...that most human traits,  even when their incidence varies by  sex, show considerable overlapping  between the sexes...We cannot, therefore determine qualifications for a  job—or lack of them—simply by sex."  If we accept Dr. Bernard's theory that  males and females share most human  traits in varying degrees in each person, then there should be no sex-based  barriers to men or women aspiring to  whatever jobs they as individuals are  characteristically suited for.  Attitudes of the male-dominated executive ranks in government and business are altering as witnessed by  the changes in government regulations  and corporate policies concerning female employees.  Canadian legislation  rules against job discrimination and  unequal pay and the federal and provincial governments have established  the Public Service and Human Rights  Commissions for the purposes of upholding the laws and furthering the  rights of women in the labour force.  Government policies regarding equal  opportunities for women within their  own public service ranks are progressive compared to the private business  sector which has not been as quick to  change. An enlightened change in attitude is, however, exemplified locally  by Woodward's Stores. Two years ago  the male senior executives of Woodw  ward's established a policy to actively promote more women into senior  management ranks. They have diligently pursued this policy to the extent  that whenever there is a managerial  opening in the company, at least one  of the candidates for the position  must be a woman. The management ranks  are slowly being filled by competent  women who are proving the sagacity of  the still male-dominated Executive's  decision.  Attitudes are definitely changing in  some instances but there are still  many barriers and harsh realities for  women to contend with if they do  aspire to managerial levels. The  slow rate of cultural change is something that women must accept and it  is just one of the invisible hurdles  to be cleared if they want to make it  up the business ladder. Invisible  barriers abound. Women must accept  the fact that they will probably eri<-  gender male and female hostility on  the wau up as well as when they reach  the top. Most women do not receive  the organizational support that their  male counterparts automatically experience and women will often be  subtly excluded from the informal  "stag" discussions where some of the  most significant thinking goes on.  Credibility is another problem, particularly in the eyes of outsiders.  A woman.just doesn't look like the  "boss". And, topping that is the  problem that women don't have wives!  Some of the other very real obstacles  to women aspiring to management ranks  are marriage and maternity.  It is  essential that married career women  have the total support of their husbands in order that they may be guilt-  free and truly free to be as flexible  as men in the same positions.  Business trips, luncheons and irregular  or long working hours may all be considered as just part of the job. Maternity can be a very negative factor  in the mind of the employer when  young women seek positions of responsibility; and, of course, the problem  of quality child care is something  that every working mother must contend  with.  Although unequal pay for women is  more of a reality in the lower labour  echelons it is still said to be apparent in the management hierarchy. However, when this point was discussed  with Vancouver business women, only  a few felt that they, were underpaid  while most felt that their salaries  were comparable to those paid to men  in similar positions. It might also  be noted here that having a higher  education does not help women as much  as it helps men to earn more money.  It is unfortunately a well accepted  fact that women must work much harder than men to prove their ability.  Pauline Jewett said that she knows  she was put through twice as many  hoops as her male counterparts when  she was seeking her original political nomination in 1961 and, also,  when she was applying for her present  position as President of Simon Fraser  University. Dr. Jewett believes that  because of excessive adversities that  women must overcome as they rise to  senior levels, they actually begin  to thrive on adversity.  She also  believes that women are almost too  grateful for the "good" things (jobs  won) that they do receive. This, in  her opinion, tends to make a woman  a more cooperative and sensitive  secretary to executive provided, as  Letty Cottin Pogrebin says, "...you  have the three 'C's*—competence,  confidence and cool."  A discussion of the realities for women in business would not be complete  without a look at the rewards they  are seeking. Ms. Pogrebin, the enthusiastic Director of Publicity for  Bernard Geiss Publishers, New York,  has no doubts that a career in the  business world offers everything for  a girl who wants everything: a chance  to have a fascinating social life,  challenges, rewards, money and a family all simultaneously. More seriously  though, there are the very human ego  returns; the feeling of expertise,  success in the eyes of others, and  women  in business  why not?  "boss*. If this is true, and if there  were more women actually clearing the  hurdles to the boss's chair, then I  believe we would see a less authori-*  tarian pattern of administration  evolve.  For all the obstacles for women in  business there is perhaps one encouraging fact.  In some fields of  business talent is more important  than education and thus higher education is not absolutely necessary  although it is certainly an advantage.  It is possible therefore to  take the experimental route from  the wonderful feeling of self-confidence and self-fulfillment.  Having considered the obstacles and  the rewards inherent for women in  the world of business, one might well  pose the question: Is the career—  the rat-race as we know it to be for  men—worth the candle? Perhaps it  isn't when you study the masculine  concept of career and its dehumanize  ing demands. That is partly why women so often can not and are not willing to pay the price for men's careers per se. So, why not liberate  men as well as women by "adjusting  the Establishment to the lives of  women rather than the lives of women  to the Establishment." Why not?  Assuming that women will want to pursue a meaningful and stimulating life  via a business career, albeit on their  own terms, in what fields of business  are they most likely to succeed?  Traditionally they have found fewer  barriers in the fields of personnel,  public relations, advertising and retailing.  Senior positions are now  opening up for women in other fields  such as finance...banking, insurance,  and investments. And, the fields of  consumer products, real estate, construction, leisure time and civil service are all considered ripe for women in the future.  If a woman wants  to eliminate the hurdles of the traditionally male-dominated fields she  is advised to look to the underpopulated or new fields opening up such  as computer science.  Women should not be discouraged from  seeking success in any field in which  they show ability and interest. That  they can achieve success has been  proven by those described by Caroline  Bird as the "Loophole Women", those  topflight women who have made it to  the top in almost every field.  Some  have succeeded through sheer hard  work and competence and others have  succeeded through being related to  the owner or president of the company  —an easier route to be sure!  The success of Mary Wells Lawrence,  President of Wells Greene, Advertising Agency, N.Y., is well known and  she is definitely one who has made  it to the top on her talent and drive.  Katherine Meyer Graham found herself  in management in the newspaper and  publishing business following her  husband's sudden death in 1963.  By  1967 she had overwhelmingly proven  her ability by building up the Washington Post into the third largest  daily in advertising lineage.  Mildred Cousin of Bonwit Teller and  Gerry Stutz of Henri Bendel in the  United States, are proof that women  can be very successful presidents of  large stores.  Other pattern breakers are Julia  Walsh who, in 1965, was the first wo-  woman to gain a seat on the American  Stock Exchange (while managing a  household of twelve children!) and  Muriel Siebert who, on 1967, was the  first woman admitted to membership  in the New York Stock Exchange.  Also prominent in the financial field  is Sylvia Ostry, the recently appointed Deputy Minister of Consumer and  Corporate Affairs for the Canadian  Government*  Singling out these few nationally  eminent business women may prove  that women are capable of assuming  senior business positions. One might,  however, feel somewhat awed by their  success and regard them as exceptionally superior women whom one could  not hope to emulate.  I will not argue this point but will cite some  Vancouver business women who, by virtue of being successful right here in  our city, may serve as more realistic  models.  Marilyn Chilvers, homemaker and mother, is the Public Affairs Director  for Canada Safeway Ltd, and such, is  an executive of the company. Marilyn  did not rise through the ranks as is  customary in her company but was  brought in j>ust over a year ago to  fill a newly created position, one  that was admittedly created with a  man in mind.  Highly respected in the financial  field is Barbara McDougall, a senior  research analyst, who fills the function of assistant manager of the research department at Odium Brown &  T.B. Read Ltd.  Barbara honoured in  economics and political science at  university and began her career in  finance as an economist in a bank.  With ten years experience in the investment industry she now has no  qualms about aspiring to more senior  levels.  Alix Granger is another highly competent woman who, after three years  in the computer industry and nine  years as a security analyst, earned  her master's degree in economics at  Simon Fraser University while serving  as the only woman instructor in the  Commerce Department. This year, after time out for a family, Alix has  written a book entitled Investing  Profitably in Canada in which she  offers advice to the investor and  bold criticism to the business community.  Computer systems engineer, management  consultant, Vice-President of Operations of the Vancouver Stock Exchange  —men's roles? Perhaps, but all are  former jobs employed by Barbara Berg  who is presently doing merger and  acquistion work in the Strategic  Planning Department of MacMillan  Bloedel Ltd.  In another field of finance is Suzanne  LaBarge, M.B.A., who is treading on  formerly exclusively male terrain as  a senior assistant manager at a major  Vancouver branch of the Royal Bank of  Canada.  Even the very staid world of  banking is beginning to recognize women for managerial levels although  there are still no female bank officers (executives) in the Canadian  banking system.  Prominent in the personnel field are  Audrey Schatz and Barbara Rae who  serve as presidents and general managers of their own respective companies. Having risen from the secretarial ranks to their executive suites,  both of these very successful "total"  women agree that personnel is an excellent field for women to advance  These few women are indeed breaking  old rules by aspiring to and succeeding in roles traditionally held only  by men. They have each dealt with  and obviously overcome most of the  barriers set up by society for women  in business and, by. doing so, they  have helped to lower or eliminate  those barriers for women to follow.  The laws have been written. External and internal attitudes towards women are slowly changing. Equal opportunity for women has theoretically been  achieved. Now, it is up to women  themselves to take advantage of the  new climate of opportunity and to realize fully their own potential in  whatever way they choose. Women do  have a choice.  If they are confident,  bright and eager to penetrate the managerial/executive ranks in the business world, then, why not?  -Judy Gosney  Women in Business—Why Not? was originally submitted as a term paper for  the Professional Development Seminar  (Commerce 180) at Capilano College  taught by Andrea Kiss. One of the most important tasks  facing any feminist is communication  with others.  It is imperative.that  we speak up about women's issues to  government, share knowledge with  and pass on information to other  feminist groups as well as sharing  our understanding of the women's  movement with those who have not  yet "heard the word".  In doing  public speaking to non-feminist  groups this past year as a V.S.W.  staff member I have slowly evolved  a formula that seems to work for  me and I'd like to share it with  you.  These points may not work for  everyone, but they have proved most  successful when used for high  schools, business associations,  sorority groups, community groups  etc.  You will note that the  "rhetoric" of the movement is  missing from my comments and that's  because I have a strong feeling  that the rhetoric is often too  threatening as a first introduction.  If a person can't chew, you don't  feed them granola, you mix up a  healthy concoction of pablum  and wheat germ and spoon feed them  the first time around! Here goes:  1. Begin by describing as generally  yet as succinctly as possible what  the women's movement is doing for  our society, and what your particular  group is doing for women in your  community.  People need a precise  definition to work from, let's give  them one of ours for a change.(Have  fun working out something you can say  in less than 10 minutes! Perservere,  having that "definition" is a great  way to start.)  2. Be knowledgeable about the Report  of the Royal Commission on the Status  of Women and its recommendations.  There  is food for a thousand speeches in  that document.  Be aware of the changes  that have occurred since the Report  was released four years ago. Know  about the Advisory Council on the Status  of Women, their background study papers  and recommendations they have put  forward. ACSW has also published a  bookelt entitled "What's Been Done"  that oulines all action (and inaction)  taken by the federal government on  Royal Commission recommendations under  their jurisdiction. Use it.  Your audience can often become activated  around proposed legislation or the  lack of it.  3. Have pertinent facts and figures  on hand to prove your points about  discrimination. The Women's Bureau  of the federal Department of Labour  publishes a yearly report entitled  "Facts and Figures on Women in the  Labour Force" that will provide the  you with enough depressing statistics  to last a lifetime.  4. "Real life stories" are the best  education/conversion tactic. The  message goes home with a punch when  people can relate personally to the  issues at hand.  So many are not  aware of the enormity of the problem,  others may be living through them  but are unaware of where to go for  assistance. The topic of rape is  a good example.  When we talk about  what is likely to happen to a  raped woman from the time of the  assault to her appearance (or  non-appearance) in the courtroom  you can feel the anger and concern  rising from the audience.  Invariably someone asks how this  can be so and our tactic has been  to throw the question back at them  speak up!!  and immediately the group gets into  a discussion of how our society  views a woman's sexuality, or  perhaps female "passivity" versus  male "aggression".  Thanks to the  assistance of staff at Vancouver's  Rape Relief Centre we are able to  offer guidelines on how to combat  this situation within the present  legal framework.  Then we talk  about research that is being done  on rape and let people know how  they can involve themselves in  working towards change. And there  it is - you have created a concern,  offered educational guidelines  and provided a consciousness-raising  experience.  Similar situations can occur  around employment discrimination.  I recall a terrific speech given  by Shelagh Day of the Human Rights  Branch in which she told story after  story about discrimination based  on sex that clearly underlined  the immensity of the problem.  When she was finished people KNEW  exactly what sex discrimination  was all about, and she had educated  several hundred more people about  how to begin combatting it with  effective use of the Human Rights  Code.  5. Make it clear that the Women's  Liberation Movement is not only  concerned about the need for new  legislation, but is actively  working- to change society's  stereotyped view of women. Point  out that this means not only  working out in society to change  educational policy, media images  etc., but working directly with  women and within the movement in  consciousness-raising groups, self-  help couselling, health and abortion  lobby groups.  It is not only  society's attitude towards women  that needs adjusting, it is our  own well-conditioned attitude  towards ourselves. One of the  lines people throw out is "Aren't  women their own worst enemies?"  My response to that is "Yes, we've  been trained very well, but the  movement, offers support and guidance  for those of us who want to move  out of the competitive sphere of  behaviour".  Education and media are stimulating  topics and I'll take a few sentences  to deal with them. There has been  much material produced regarding the  need non-sexist educational  practices, women's studies etc.  The B.C. Teacher's Federation has  a Status of Women contact person  in every district of the province  and she has a wealth of printed  and practical information to share  with those who ask her. Use her as  a resource person or contact the  B.C.T.F. directly for information.  You can gather together examples of  sexist advertisements to take along  for a talk on media images of women.  Mount the ads on construction paper,  group them together according to the  sexist idea they are portraying and  they will do much of the convincing  for you. You may find, as we have,  that many non-feminist women feel  we are Vnit-picking" when it comes  to criticizing sexist ads.  They  are all for equal pay but see nothing  wrong with being depicted as mindless  sex objects! Try and direct the  discussion towards women's attitudes  towards oneself pointing out how  this is shaped by the world around  us and this will often sharpen  the focus on the danger of sexist  advertising. A tactic that often  creates a "buzz" in a mixed group  is to ask the following question,  firstjof all the women, then of all  the men - "If there was anything  you could change about your body  would you do it?" We find that many  more women than men agree that they  would want to change their body or  appearance. We ask "Why?" and  suggest that perhaps sexist  advertising, reflecting societal  pressures for a woman to be  eternally young, sexy, thin,  always men-pleasing , could have  a part in their attitude towards  themselves.  Someone will invariably  point out that men have damaging  stereotypes too - and we agree with  them, pointing out that the women's  movement wishes to remove all  damaging sex role stereotyping  and usually commenting that the  typical male stereotype still  leaves them in a position of  self-determination/power/independence  whereas the female stereotype is  the reverse!  6.  Be prepared, especially in mixed  groups, to handle the typical put-  downs.  Some that I've heard -  "What do you women really want?",  "I like being feminine - you  probably haven't even got a man",  "Your organization must be for  weak women only", "All women who  have children must take the  responsibility of staying home  and taking care of them".  Put-downs usually come from  ignorance, misunderstanding, fear  or outright prejudice.  If you want  to deal with them at all first try  to isolate the cause, then take the  appropriate action.  Ignorance can usually be removed  or lessened when you take a few  minutes to make your point clearer.  Fear can be safely defused when  you openly acknowledge it.  I  have seen many tense situations  unwind when one says "It sounds  as if you "are afraid of this coming  about...", or"I understand your  fear of this but...". Unless I've  got a zinger of a response I leave  prejudiced comments alone.  They  don't deserve the honour of a reply.  After a year of talking to people  both in and out of the women's  movement I am convinced that those  of us who can should work towards  removing the media stereotype of  the "women's libber" wherever we  can.  I am constantly aghast  at the amount of damage it has done. .  Time and time again women have come  up to me after a talk and said,  "I didn't think women's lib was  like this at all!" It takes time,,  and it takes energy and some women  argue that this time and energy should  be focussed on other activities within  the movement. cThe truth is that there  is much untapped energy and support  out there in all of our communities  and I think if at all possible, we  should start looking for the key  that fits the door to their  meeting rooms.     -Diana Bissell  See P. 13 for a list of resources  useful for building speeches.

NEWS  BREAST CANCER DETECTION EQUIPMENT  Breast cancer detection equipment was  installed recently in Lion's Gate  Hospital, North Vancouver. Eventually  25 other regional centres will have  similar equipment available. While  this program is an important step  forward, Colin Gabelmann, MLA, says  it does not meet the need for a mass  breast cancer screening program. He  urges concerned people to write to  the Minister of Health Dennis Cocke,  Parliament Buildings, Victoria, B.C.,  carbon copy to himself, pressing for  such a program.  WCWN  SPOTLIGHT on a member  Ever since she was in High School,  Joy Bradbury has planned to go to  Law School.  After her B.A. these plans were postponed while she took teacher training  and taught for a year so that she and  her husband could both afford to take  a year out to travel in Europe. When  she arrived back in Vancouver, Joy  applied for admittance to the UBC Law  School and was accepted.  However by the time the 1970-71 term  was to begin she had an infant daughter  to consider. And she had her awareness  of one of the special problems faced  by women raised very abruptly! She  simply could not find suitable care  for daughter Jennifer while she attended classes. At that time there was no  Day Care at UBC — and very little  anywhere else!  Joy had to inform the Law School that  she was withdrawing. It was, she says,  "one of the most difficult things I  have ever had to do." Positions in  the School were difficult to obtain.  There was only one other woman in the  class. It was unlikely that the opportunity would occur again.  Staying at home that winter Joy did  some free lance writing on various  political and sociological topics  (she is still a stringer for.Newsday  in New York) and a lot of thinking.  The nudge she needed came in 1972 with  the Provincial elections. NDP candidate Phyllis Young was running for  MLA in the Little Mountain Constituency  and one of her leaflets arrived at  Joy's home.  It stated that Ms. Young  was, among other things, a member of  the VSW Executive. Joy had been aware  of VSW, had seen it mentioned in the  media, had read the newsletter. It  seemed that her interests were converging on a point where she could  take action. She phoned the NDP Office  and went out to canvas for Phyllis  Young. At a coffee party given for  Ms. Young by Carole Anne Soong she  met more women who were involved in  the feminist movement and she decided  to join VSW.  Her interest in community and political work did not end with the election of her candidate. She herself was  eleeted to the executive of the Little  Mountain NDP Constituency and last  year was Vice-President of the group.  Although she no longer lives in the  Little Mountain area, she still does  constituency work, primarily with the  newspaper "The Mountaineer."  Joy is excited about the contacts women are building with one another,  the network that is forming. In her  work in politics she has seen the  clout of the traditional power blocks  — the unions, the "Old Boys", etc.  Now women are starting to build a  power block and "they can't ignore  us!"  Remembering the helplessness that she  had felt when forced to give up her  position at Law School, Joy is using  her political and organizing skills  to combat the lack of power that  limits the choices that women have.  For the past year and one-half she  has been involved with The Boat Day  Care Centre at 13th and Victoria,due  to be opened officially in September  by MLA Phyllis Young. The Centre consists of seven pre-fab units and funding is provided by the Human Resources  Board. As one' of the organizers and  member of the Board of Directors, Joy  has been adamant that the children  at the Centre will be treated in a  non-sexist manner. This is a consideration in the hiring of staff and  such traditional features as "Dolls'  Corners" have been replaced by "Imagination Corners" where the children  can dress up, and create things from  various shapes. The only sour note  so far is the embarrassingly low salary  the Board of Directors must offer to  trained people doing work as vital  and demanding as caring for children,  Joy has also been working with the  VSW Federal Action Committee, a small  group formed to learn more about federal politics and legislation that  affect women. They decided to focus  their attention on the Canadian Pension Plan and its treatment of women  (eg. the exclusion of homemakers). A  great deal of research (and a great  many meetings!) led .to a brief containing recommendations which is due  to be released in September.  Until she resigned for philosophical  reasons in May, Joy was also a member  of the BC Federation of Women. She  had been elected at the BCFW Convention at UBC in September, 1974.  As we have all learried, when you become involved in political, or feminist, or community issues, as your  committment grows things really tend  to snowball.  It is very easy to get  to the point where every waking moment  seems to be spent organizing, meeting,  discussing, researching, lobbying,etc.  Fascinating but exhausting! Joy found  that she had to learn to pace herself,  to set priorities, to recognize which  issues are most urgent. She feels it  is important to maintain a social existence that is not just narrowed to  people who share her opinions and interests. It is necessary to be aware  of other opinions and values.  Joy's main priorities are her family,  the women's movement and politics and  she feels economically privileged in  that she can afford to make the choice  to stay home with her children until  both are in school — Jennifer 5,years,  Keith 4 months.  She enjoys the time  she has to spend with her family and  feels that the work she is doing will  help guarantee that Jennifer will feel  free to make her own choices in how  she uses her life.  Her husband Keith is interested in her  activities.  "He told me to say I  couldn't do it without him," Joy reported. "I refuse to say it, but he  is very supportive."  Any lingering regrets about the lost  law careerx  I asked. Joy is getting  that under control too. She is taking  law courses from the University of  London as an external student. She  does her courses by correspondence  and the UBC Law School supervises her  exams. The courses and exams are the  same as those taken by internal students. (The University of London has  accepted external students for years.  UBC is still debating whether or not  to have night and downtown classes.)  In approximately four years she will  have an English Law Degree and if a  law firm here will accept her as an  articling student, she can be admitted  to the Bar.  She doesn't anticipate  any problem. But as Joy points out,  she knows a lot more about how to  overcome problems now.  - Jo Lazenby  book  Just in time for your summer reading,  Her Own Woman is making an appearance.  It is a profile of ten Canadian women  including such notables as Judy La  Marsh, Margaret Atwood, Abby Hoffman,  sculptor Esther Warkov and others.

GROUP IS  HOLDING A RALLY'AND MARCH ON  SATURDAY, AUGUST 9 BEGINNING AT  1:30.PM AT VICTORY SQUARE AND  MARCHING UP'TO THE COURTHOUSE.  SPEAKERS, MUSIC, A CHANCE TO  DEMONSTRATE OUR FEELINGS ABOUT  CANADIAN ABORTION LAWS.  THAT'S  SATURDAY, AUGUST 9, 2 P.M.  BEGINNING AT VICTORY SQUARE.  SUMMER STAFF  LESLIE DIXON has done wonders with  our downstairs library and research  files and has brought us up to date  with all subscriptions to feminist  newspapers, magazines etc.  She is  also preparing the audio-visual  library catalogue and purchasing  some a-v equipment for our own use.  See page 5 for some of the Woman  Alive tapes that are available.  LESLIE McDONALD has initiated five  workshops for high school women  on topics ranging from rape to  abortion and is in the process of  setting up a "Career-Lifestyle"  seminar for young women to take  place in the fall.  SHEERA WAISMAN has silkscreened  several hundred new t-shirts, all  of which have sold already!  She has plans to silkscreen several  hundred more, including some that  will fit children.  She has also  designed and screened several  hundred VSW posters that we will  be posting in public areas  and is working on designs for  feminist notepaper and Christmas  cards. All of this material  will be available by the early  fall.  ORIENTATION  Even though we are in the middle  of summer, and one would think  people wouldn't go to meetings  at this time, we are always  pleasantly surprised to find .  a dozen or so women turn up  for Orientation meetings in July  and August. Orientation dates  for August are Thursday the 14th  and Thursday the 28th at 8 pm here  in the office.  Come to an  Orientation Meeting if you want  to learn more about what we do  at VSW,and how you can help.  letter'  WRAP UP  In the VSW Annual Report, the  Letter Lobby Committee is listed as  "an action oriented group which  researches problem areas and comml  unicates with provincial and federal  governments regarding the need for  action ". We began with only five  members in September of 1974 and  grew to 25 active letter lobbyists  by June of 1975.  Some of our committee's action areas  were : abortion and birth control,  breast cancer, day care, human  rights legislation, inclusion of  housewives in the Canada pension  plan, income tax, housing problems  of single parent women, labour code  violations, matrimonial property and  part time work.  In addition  individual members wrote letters on  matters which had come to their personal attention.  On May 1st we had a "work day"  which resulted in a mass mailing to  all federal M.P.'s pointing out  parliament's slowness in passing  women's legislation.  Our circular  had considerable impact, and the re  response from M.P.s and cabinet  ministers was encouraging .  (See  Miriam Gropper's article on page    Members can be assured that the  Letter Lobby Committee has made  itself known to our politicians,  especially in Ottawa. Dr. Katie  Cooke has also given us a lot of  encouragement to continue this  method of lobbying.  I personally  have found the work very satisfying  and hope that our members have as  well. A note of thanks should go  to the VSW office staff, especially  Diana Bissell, without whose help  we could not have been so effective.  FALL FOCUS  When we meet again on September 12  I would like to concentrate on several  areas of prime concern to women, one  of which is wage disparity.  I am  sure you are aware, as is every  politician, of the continuing  wage disparity between male and  female workers for identical work,  and that the gap is widening.  Our labour legislation states  lobby  that there must be "equal  pay for equal work" but employers get around this clause  by giving different names to  identical work, for example  "cleaning woman: and "janitor".  Provincial and Federal labour  codes should be amended to  read "equal pay for work of equal  value" before the law can be  fully enforced.  People can join Letter Lobby  from all over the province, and  groups can join also. We send  out minutes of our meetings to  all members to keep them informed,  and we send out a "basic info pack"  to all new members so that  everyone has access to the same  resource material.  If you are  interested in becoming *a part  of this active lobby group,  please contact the office at  2029 West 4th Avenue, Vancouver,  or call me, Dorothy Holme, at  936-1662.  Dorothy Holme,  Letter Lobby Co-rordinator Everyone owes herself a time in her  life when she lives alone and is  accountable only to. herself for her  use of time, money and decision-making  power."  This my mother told me at a time when  I was going to live alone for the first  time. Her statement came back to me  last year when I set out, during a  period of unemployment, to decide what  I really wanted to do for a living.  I had encountered a variety of occupations to that time and was ready to  find something that I felt good about  doing, that earned a reasonable salary  and wasn't going to infringe on my  free time to an unbearable degree.  That seemed like a tall order but I  fomnd that, given the time to work out  the mechanics of such a choice free  from the distractions and demands of  a full-time occupation, it wasn't as  nard as I had at first thought.  With admittedly a great many negatives  in my mind (I knew a lot of things I  didn't want to do ) I set out to list  the skills I had used in previous jobs  or that I wished to try out in a new  j ob..  I had learned and used several types  of communication skills.  In teacher  training techinques of questioning  and reporting were stressed.  I had  dealt with the public is several jobs  and enjoyed this. My experience with  teaching and law enforcement had taught  me firmness and discretion.  I had  handled cash for several employers  and knew this was something I could  do efficiently and well.  In teaching, I had had a salaried  job where the hours of actual work  were largely self-determined, and I  had decided that I did not want that.  Unless there was a direct, visible  result of my labours, I felt that the  time I spent in preparation every evening was wasted. The long hours took  their toll in my personal life—the  first year I taught I didn't read one  "good" book and I had given up active  participation in choral music, one  of my great loves.  Having failed typing in high school  (the only subject I can remember failing) I was not blessed (?) with any  office skills beyond rudimentary clerical duties. I did not want to"work  in an office."  A'week of construction work in the  country had left me feeling good about  the exercise(good food as well—I  gained 10 pounds!) but too exhausted  at the end of the day to do anything  but sleep.  After this skills analysis, I was left  with a mental list of things I liked  and things I didn't like.  I found  I wanted a job where I was meeting  the public and one that was structured  enough so that I knew what was expected of me.  I wanted to be able to use  the skills that I had within this  framework. This led to the next step  which was to see if this multiplicity  of factors could fit into one job.  I rejected teaching as the hours were  too unstructured and I still had  neither the appropriate degree to  teach where I wanted nor the money to  obtain it.  A job as a storekeeper or cashier I  felt would become routine and, although  though the money is good, I didn't  want to be a store manager.  The Customs job I had had one summer  had used many of the skills I wanted  i can see  clearly now  to use in a job. I knew that I couldn't  get back on as a summer student, and  that, if I wanted to work permanently  for Customs, I would have to start as  a clerk in an office somewhere. (I  knew that,I would then be eligible  to apply for job openings as they  occurred since job openings, advertised ..on a competitive basis, are usually only available to those already  employed in the Public Service.) A  look at the organization of the Department showed me that a wide range of  occupations was available and not out  of my reach in skills, although I  noticed that when women were appointed to positions of authority ( and  higher salary) it was almost always  in the field of personnel. There i^  one woman Collector (in Cornwall, Ontario). The Collector is responsible  for the admimistration of the port  and I believe she is the only one in  Canada.  I had first hand knowledge  -of what the job of Inspector entailed  and felt that, given a lot of study,  I would be able to do that job adr-  equately or at least know enough about  it to qualify for eligibility in the  competition.  After many calls to Manpower about  jobs in the Public Service, I obtained a casual position working for Manpower as a clerk. While with Manpower  I looked for a permanent job with the  Public Service, preferably with Customs  and Excise, Just before my job was  terminated I learned of a job for  clerks in Customs and was interviewed  and accepted.  Immediately I began looking for pro-"  motional competitions, either for the  level I wanted to be in at the airport  or at an intermediate level elsewhere  to enable me to get a wider range of  expe-ience. I had planned to study  one night a week, at least, in preparation for competiton for the kind of  position I wanted.  I noticed two  days after I started that there was  an opnning for an intermediate position and I decided that since I was  going to be studying anyway, this  would give me motivation. Since there  were obvious economic benefits associated with getting the promotion, it  was relatively easy for me to give  preparation a high priority when I  planned my free time activities. I  studied every night, learning regulations and all the other things I needed to know for my ihterviEw.  All this paid off—I got the promotion  and was sent to the Post Office to  work. Happily a supervisor who had  been most supportive of my aspirations  within Customs was there.  Soon a poster appeared for an outside  officer (Inspector), which was just  What I had been waiting for.  I knew  that this position was due to be reclassified and that the requirements  would probably change when this occurred. This, therefore, seemed to be  the time to apply. Even though I had  been with Customs permanently only  four months, I had had previous experience and I had used my preparation  time well. I had learned alot and  knew where to find information which  was not at my fingertips.  I was going for my holidays on tour with the  Bach Choir to eastern Canada, and I  requested a letter of introduction so  that I could study in the various  cities we would be visiting. When I  got to Montreal I called Customs and  asked for permission to use what materials theu had available for study  purposes.  I found the people I talked to most helpful and ended up spending two days with the officers working on the docks, learning about the  clearance of vessels large and small.  The interview took place shortly after  my return to Vancouver and again I  was successful in getting the promotion I sought.  I was placed at the  airport, where I wanted to be, which  reinforced my feelings of suitability  to the organization and also made the  studying very worthwhile.  I feel comfortable about doing my  job and will probably feel this way  for some time to come.  I have had  good feedback from my superiors about  my work. From here I would like to  go farther within the organization  but I'm not sure where yet.  I would  like to stay within the operational  part of Customs rather than personnel.  I'm presently going through a decisionmaking process similar to when I was  choosing a career, only this time on  a smaller scale.  I am deciding now  whether to apply for a transfer to  the dock area(although I really like  airport work) as there is a greater  variety of activity on the waterfront,  and it is a good place to gain experience. One of the women I work with  recently started to work there and  now that there is one woman on the  waterfront I feel a little; better  about making the move myself. It is  also encouraging with regard to the  position of women in Customs. Until  now it was unthinkable that a woman  would work on the docks. Reasons—  the ones given me included the dirtiness of the job(it's mainly outdoors)  and the language one is exposed to.  There is also the fear that a woman  working on the docks was setting herself up to be raped by the first sailor on the first ship she had to board,  I'm not sure whose fantasy that was.  but it seems the area of town has  little to do with the possibility of  being attacked and raped. This is  not a happy situation by far, but it  certainly weakens the argument that  women shouldn't be working around  marine traffic.  I found the process of analysing what  I really wanted to do for a career  very exhilarating and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who is  either dissatisfied with her present  job or is seeking one for the first  time. It's not easy to do, especially  if one is not used to thinking of  oneself in analytical terms, but it  pays off. Seeing something through  from thought to cashing the paycheque  (which is the object of the whole  exercise after all) gives a feeling  of accomplishment I have found in few  other areas of my life.  I learned  a great deal about myself and my  skills and when the payoff came I can  can truly say that I deserved it, and  having battled a negative self-image  for most of my life, this was the  greatest satisfaction.  -Rosalind Bell 16  In the course of writing their book,  "Never Done, Three Centuries of Women's  Work in Canada," the Corrective Collective, a Vancouver feminist writer's  group, found that male scholars preoccupied with war and politics had  written women out of history.  "Well yes, there were a few general  references to women as in ... 'the  women and children were ... left at  /V£  the fort, or drowned in the river,  /'*  or starved in winter'..." But, what<  else did women do?      ...  "—-^^  Faced with the task of rediscovering//  and reconstructing Canadian women's '. -  history themselves, the Corrective Ljrt,  Collective turned less to academic K  than to personal accounts:  family Igexi  scrapbooks, novels by women, diaries, J-  letters. c .—  The book is presented in a picture-  and-story album format, with hand-  drawn illustrations, a print version  of stories passed from mother to  daughter over the generations.  "Never Done" spans some 300 years,  beginning with the European women who  braved long and perilous ocean voyages to come to an unknown colony  during the 1600's.  Coming to Canada  out of desperation, in many cases  their lives here weren't any better.  Imagine the culture shock of a.civilized urban woman reduced to the isolation and heavy labour of pioneer life!  Life for the pioneer woman 200 years  later, in the 1800's, was much the  same.  Recounting the memoirs of a  prairie woman whose ranch was on the  main settler's trail, the book tells  how she had to cook for all the men  or get a bad name in the district.  In her words, "it was a life of slavery.  In shearing-time I had to cook  for 15 men; they needed five meals a  day and I couldn't get a woman to  help me for love or money."  In summer, to avoid a fire in the heat of  the day, she rose at 4 a<m. to do  the ironing.  In the early days, women helped change  things not because of any social or  political philosophy so much as out  of a need to survive.  Isolated in  the bush, our foremothers wrote of  their need for female companionship  in their diairies.  They were leaders  in founding back-woods churches and  bees because they offered a chance  women's work is  "NEVER DONE"  m  'i'<^L  to socialize. Women also agitated  for better roads so they could do  some visiting.  Their lives were harsh. Treated as  chattels, they suffered numerous pregnancies, chronic ill health and early  death.  It is not surprising many  women opted for life in the church,  where nuns "had the rarest treasure  for a Canadian woman, leisure to pursue their own interests," and freedom  from unwanted pregnancy.  Although housework was the main occupation of most pioneer women, it was  not the only one. Women cleared the  land, worked as loggers, owned and  operated mines, hunted for meat and  trapped furs.  They did this while  raising families, with or without  husbands, they built and furnished  houses, tended livestock and worked  their farms," long before equal  rights legislation.  "Never Done" describes events in the  Rebellions of Upper and Lower Canada,  when women managed to find the time  to take part in war by "spying,  sheltering fugitives, and sabotage."  While the names of soldiers who died  in battle were remembered, most female  victims remain nameless in history.  The Corrective Collective also  retrieved some of the history of  women's involvement in economic lobbying as good examples for women  today who are trying to improve the  status of working women. Did you  know that "militant action in Lower  Canada began with a boycott of English  goods, led by women."? They had been  displaced as spinners, weavers and  dressmakers by imported clothing and  wanted to preserve their livelihoods.  The book closes with an examination  of the role of women in the Industrial  Revolution, working as servants,  teachers, nurses, salesclerks, "typewriters" and in factories. They began  a history as exploited workers which  continues in the 20th century.  "Today, more women work for wages,  but come the end of the week, women  s-e.-Nstill say to themselves, "Oh Lord,  It's Friday already and the laundry's  not done.'  So ... women's work is  still in the home."  " "Each decade brings new politicians,  a ,new war. But women's work is so  much the same.  The methods of doing  her work may improve, but her role  and the major tasks of the home remain constant."  "Never Done" is not concerned with  the well-known female historical personality, but the "millions who never  became famous, for in these millions,  rests the history of women in Canada."  Andrea Lebowitz , one of five women  who wrote the book collectively says  that "Never Done" has been selling well  in B.C.  It was published in Toronto  by the Canadian Women's Educational  Press in November 1974 and already more  than 5,000 have been sold.  Another 10,000 have been ordered by  the B.C. Department of Education for  inclusion as a classroom text on social  studies in every senior high school  in B.C.  The book should be available for $ 3.95  in most of the larger bookstores and  libraries in the lower mainland.

Reversing  her previous position, in June she  took a stand advocating the integration of women's studies  material into existing curricula,  rather than the implementing of a  separate course as an elective—  an approach she now called "questionable".,  A public meeting sponsored by the  B.C. Teacher's Federation on the  25th of June passed the following  resolution: "Whereas Women's Studies  Courses are valid curriculum content  and should be included in the program of each secondary school, BE IT  RESOLVED THAT the existing Women's  Studies Course be printed and distributed by the department of Education to each secondary school as  a model for locally developed courses  on this topic."  A subsequent meeting discussed possible action to be taken in September  in order to gain public support for  Women's Studies Courses—public meetings, petitions, polling of students,  printing of the course, etc. The  strong feeling voiced at this meeting  was that "integration" of women's  studies into existing curricula (read  burying), was totally unacceptable.  On the 9th of July, Heather Knapp and  Jane Gaskell, the two women who wrote  the course, and Gail Neuberger, Linda  Shuto, and Reva Dexter of the Advisory  Committee on Sex Discrimination in  Public Education, met with Eileen  Dailly. On this occasion the Minister  said she had reconsidered, and would  once again be prepared to endorse and  print the course as a unit, provided  that certain revisions were made.  The newest list of objections include  the discussion of common law marriage  in the "Family" section, certain parts  of "Images of Masculinity and Femininity", and the changing of the title  "Biology" to "Physiology".  She also  indicated that she would like to see  the "Politics" and "History" sections  expanded.  A spokesperson for the Minister said  that the official status of the course  is that it is "under review".  In a  statement made by Ms. Dailly on July  17th, she said that the department  has had "some difficulty" in approving  a course "...which would put over the  objectives of a women's studies course  and at the same time be a course that  has credibility and acceptance."  In any case, even if the women's  studies course is finally approved  in the near future, the delay has  been effective—now the earliest  that it could possibly be available  to students is September of 1976.  Leslie McDonald media action.  The Media Action Group has come  across this excellent media guideline in the July/75 issue of Media  Report to Women that they have decided  to reprint here for you to use in  your own resource file and letter-  writing.  A fully copy of this  report entitled "Advertising and  Women, A Report on Advertising  Portraying or Directed to Women"  may be obtained from the National  Advertising Review Board, 850 Third  Avenue, New York, NY, 10022.  National Advertising Review Board  tells how to clean up sexist ads.  The Report of the Consultative Panel  on Advertising Portraying or Directed  to Women has been released by the  National Advertising Review Board.   ^,  The NARB established the Panel in  1972 after receiving repeated  complaints about the treatment  of women in ads.  "To deny that the problem exists,  in fact, is to deny the effectiveness  of advertising.", said the Panel's  Report.  "For what the critics are  saying is that advertising, in selling  a product, often sells a supplementary  product as well.  Sometimes in  woman-related advertising, that  image is negative and deprecatory.  Unfortunately, such images may be  accepted as true to life by many  men, women and children especially  when they reinforce stereotypes  of a time gone by.  Seen in this  light, advertising must be regarded  as one of the forces molding society. Those who protest that  advertising merely reflects society  must reckon with the criticism  that much of the current reflection  of women in advertising is out of  date'.'  Following a section of the Report  on the Panel's findings when it  examined ads are four checklists  for advertisers,- questions ad  writers and companies should ask  themselves before creating or  approving an advertisement. Two  checklists seek to avoid destructive  portrayals and negative appeals  and two checklists seek constructive  portrayals and positive appeals. A  few excerpts from the constructive  portrayals checklist are:  "Are the attitudes and behaviour  of the women in my ads suitable  models for my own daughter to copy?  Will I be happy if my own female  children grow up to act and react  the way the women in my ads act and  react?"  "Do my ads reflect the fact that  girls may aspire to careers in  business and the professions? Do  they show, for example, female  doctors and female executives?  Some women with both male and  female assistants?"  "Do my ads portray women and  men (and children) sharing in the  chores of family living?  "Do the women in my^ads make  decisions (or help make them)  about the purchase of high-priced  items and major family investments?  "Do my ads portray women  actually driving cars and showing  an intelligent interest in  mechanical features, not just in  the colour and upholstery?  "Do my ads portray two-income  families? For example, husband and  wife leaving home or returning from  work together?  "Are the women in my ads doing  creative or exciting things? Older  women too?  In social and occupational environments? For  example, making a speech, in a  laboratory, or approving an ad?"  responses  Last months's MEDIA ACTION featured  the ad for "Love's Baby Soft". A  member of the Penticton Women's  Centre sent us the following letter:  Dear Karen:  In response to your article in the  current copy of Kinesis on "Love's  Baby Soft',' just let me outline the  apathetic responses that I have received from both "Chatelaine" and  "Miss Chatelaine" upon admonishing  them for publishing this ad.  Chatelaine— "The editorial department has no connection with the advertising department and we do not  see ads until they actually appear  in the magazine."  Women are the writers and editor but  a male advertising crew determine the  advertising policy!  Miss Chatelaine — "... magazine publishing in Canada is a tenuous proposition. .. decisions are made on the  basis of money in the bank. The choice  becomes: a magazine with flaws vs no  magazine at all."  Neither editor seemed sufficiently  disturbed by their lack of control  over advertising content to do anything about it.  I hope you have more success.  I was  extremely discouraged in receiving  their responses but now that I see  that others feel the same way, will  carry on .and write directly to the  manufacturer.

The result of this  classic piece of Victoriana was that  Lesbianism, in England, has never been  illegal in the criminal sense, although  from a social standpoint, lesbians  have encountered every shade of treatment from social ostracism to misunderstanding and downright persecution.  Krafft-Ebing in Psychopathia Sexualis,  published in 1882, writes of over two  hundred medical cases that he consider-'  ed to be deviates, and here among the  necrophiliacs, rapists, child molesters  and sundry other charmers, are the  histories of seventeen lesbians.  Thus in 1928 when Radclyffe Hall, a  lesbian, or invert, as she preferred  to say, a distinguished author and1  winner of several international awards,  wrote a book on lesbianism she was  taking a great risk. At first all went  well and the critics of the more responsible newspapers recognized her  sincerity in stating that "I wrote  the book from a deep sense of duty.  I am proud indeed to have taken up  my pen in defence of those who are  utterly defenceless...." Unfortunately  the Sunday Express published a sensational article, complete with banner  headlines and "butch" pictures which  contained the stirring statement, "I  would rather put a phial of prussic  acid in the hands of a healthy girl  or boy than the book in question."  The end result of all this was an  application from the Director of Public Prosecutors for an order under  the Obscene Publications Act of 1857,  which gave magistrates the power to  order destroyed any obscene book.  Norman Birkett (later Lord Birkett,  and a most respected advocate) appeared  on behalf of the publishers and in  an impassioned plea (impassioned for  him that is; he was a rather reserved  gentleman) declared "Nowhere is there  an obscene word or a lascivious passage,  it is a sombre, sad, tragic,  artistic revelation of that which is  an undoubted fact in this world." All  to no avail, since the magistrate refused to hear any of the thirty-nine  distinguished witnesses called to  speak in the book's defense and ruled  that since the subject was obscene,  ergo the book was obscene. Radclyffe  Hall, bitterly disappointed, but surely not surprised, left for Europe,  her book banned in England, but a  roaring best-seller in the United  States.  That defence by Norman Birkett  (described in Norman Birkett by H.  Montgomery Hyde, 1964) stayed in my  mind as a compassionate, deeply felt  plea from a very "straight" man. So  I was elated to find (in an exhibition  of banned books from the Bible on  down, or up, according to your point  of view) a paperback copy of The Well  of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall, published by Corgi at $1.95.  Norman Birkett was surely right in  his assessment; it is certainly  neither "obscene" nor "lascivious"  and although the literary style is  somewhat overblown, it is a sad and  very touching book. The London Times  Literary Supplement review of the time  said," this long novel, sincere, courageous, high-minded and often beautifully expressed as it is, fails as a  work of art through divided purpose  ..." This is a fair comment, but I  found it a moving engrossing story  and quite acceptable as such, if not  a "work of art;"  During the ensuing search to find out  something about Radclyffe Hall, (which  was easier said than done, I may say)  I came across a remarkable book Woman  + Woman, by Dolores Klaich, published  by Simon & Schuster, Rockefeller Centre  630 Fifith Ave., New York 10020, in  1974. As far as I can tell, it is  only available in the States, and none  of the local bookshops have heard of  it. Subtitled Attitudes Toward Lesbianism, it is exactly that, from interviews with lesbians to sex and psychology (Freud et al.) and what Klaich calls  historic witnesses from Sappho to  Stein and Woolf, taking in Radclyffe  Hall and others, enroute. Although  obviously not widely known, nor reviewed in any of the publications I  read, it is a book that should be  publicized if only because 'at the  time of this writing'(Woman + Woman)  "the only mass-marketed book written  by a psychiatrist devoted solely to  lesbianism was Frank S. Caprio's  Female Homosexuality". Klaich asserts  that, largely for lack of other; general books on the subject, Caprio's  book "has taken on, for the public,  something of a definite appearance."  Klaich then quotes and analyzes Capr  rio's views ranging from "Lesbians  are basically unhappy people" to "women unconsciously prefer to fulfill  their maternal role and to be loved  by a man." His data apparently comes  largely from interviews with prostie  tutes and with his patients and since,  as Klaich points out, the great majority of lesbians are neither the one  or the other, this presents an unbalanced view at best.  But the real  mind-boggier is that Gaprio uses as  one of his sources, cases from Life  Romances, and even the people who  write these epics don't believe them.  Perhaps Klaich should have set her  book in novel form, which would have  undoubtedly made the best-seller list,  even though it is not a "sensational"  book, but-a well-researched, fascinating and,I feel, ultimately fair and  very readable book about a touchy  (still) subject.  - Margaret Nicholls  the avid articler  AVID ARTICLER  Carol McQuarrie who has an uncanny  knack for finding Free publications  with articles for feminists sends in  the following two goodies:  BOOKS IN CANADA — a national review  of books— May 1975.

Sincerely,  M.D. Power  Ed. note - Yes Ms. Power, we are  aware of the age range we are reaching,  our readership ages (that we know  of) run from age 13 to 82.  Sisters:  I was so pleased to read the article  "Feminist English". Words are indeed  very powerful. We define ourselves  and others through words.  Those who have the right to define  are masters of the situation. Lewis  Carroll ("Through the Looking Glass")  understood this clearly.  "When I use a word," Humpty  Dumpty said in a rather scornful  tone,"it means just what»I choose  it to mean—neither more nor less."  "The question is,"said Alice,  "is whether you can make words mean  so many different things."  "The question is," said Humpty  Dumpty,"is which is to be master—  that's all."  Sincerly,  Lee Smith  Dear Friends:  If anyone would like any info  regarding aspects of being a  letter carrier, please feel free  to call.

Academic, statistical and personal material is being solicited. Persons interested  can.assist by: sending a copy of any  published article that appears rele«r  vant (give source and date); writing  your thoughts and experiences, giving  your age and occupation, with consideration to what you have accomplished  in your personal life and/or career  that you attribute to the fact that  you have never married.  Send submissions by August 31, 1975,  to Marianne Bossen, Co-ordinator,  Research Committee, 123 Home St.,  Winnipeg, Manitoba R3G 1W8  Dear Sisters,  I was quite concerned and disappointed  to read in the July issue of Kinesis  two references to our "trusty post  office" and the inference of poor  service. Perhaps I could have overlooked this had this not been a fairly  regular feature of the paper as of  late. As a feminist and postal worker,  a carrier not represented by the  union I am defending, incidentally   I must protest.  First a piece of information.  From  the references in the letter you published from the P.O. Customer Service  I have assumed that the newsletters  that arrived so terribly late were  sent third class. As you know, third  class mail is considerably cheaper  than first class mail.  Cheaper rates  have their drawbacks.  Bulk mail has  absolutely no priority at the post  office.  If there is a deluge of  mail, a slowdown or a strike, this  is what waits the longest. When it  is finally sorted through its  special status continues as carriers  do not have to deliver third class  mail immediately.  Another method to ensure a speedier  delivery is the practise of boycotting the postal code. Do not  use the code and write "Boycott  the code - support postalworkers"  on the envelopes. Many people are  confused about this so I'll try  to explain briefly.  The government  wishes to automate the post office.  We applaud this as it could be  progressive and faster. However,  many people will be losing the only  job they have ever had and in many  cases, the only job they have the  skills and education to perform.  The government of Canada has given  the right to most unions to use in  their negotiations the fact that  automation threatens jobs - they  have the right to negotiate around  this. However the government is  denying this right to its own employees.  They do not want to stop  automation, they only want rights  for all the people. A job is a right.  Canada Post employs thousands as  clerks and sorters (represented by  Canadian Union of Postal Workers -  CUPW) and as carriers and drivers  (represented by Letter Carriers  Union of Canada - LCUC).  These  people are mainly unskilled and the  number of course, includes many  women. As feminists we ought to  be supporting these sisters,  brothers and friends in their  struggle to gain a decent living  wage.  It is commonly known among  post office employees that those  among us with dependents frequently  must take on a second job in order  that they might all eat.  CUPW has  also raised a demand for childcare  facilities to be established by the  government for its employees (postal  especially). This is hardly a demand  a feminist would not support.  These inside workers, in a fight  for job security and a good wage  must use the only weapons they  have - slowdowns and strikes. What  other weapons have they but the  mail? I hope I have managed to  clarify several things about the  post office - why we must support  these employees. They are only  doing what they must.  Support  them and us.  Sisterly,  Lee Smith. VSW  VSW BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING  The monthly meeting of the VSW Board  of Directors was held June 25, President Nancy Conrod in the Chair.  It was decided to renew our membership in the National Action Committee  on the Status of Women and at the  same time express our desire for a  more national representation.  Endorsement was given to the "High  School Women's Studies Course."  It was agreed to send a letter expressing VSW concern over the danger for  women in downtown parking lots to  the Downtown Parking Corporation,  with copies to Rape Relief and Darlene  Mazari.  The next Board of Directors Meeting  will be held July 23 at 7:30 pm in  the VSW Office.  general  meeting  A General Meeting of all members of  VSW will be held September 16 at 7:30  p.m. in the Board Room of the Vancouver YWCA.

Plan to attend!  SFU  Simon Fraser University President  Pauline Jewett received a letter  from the Universities Council of  British Columbia commending her action in not allowing Simon Fraser  University funds to be spent to encourage discrimination between the  sexes.  Dr. Jewett earlier wrote to her vice-  presidents, deans and chairpersons  saying that any functions paid for  by the University must be held at a  location other than the University  Club. Her memo said"The University,  of course, will not be paying for  any membership in the club or in any  other club that permits discrimination."  The University Club denied membership  to Dr. Jewett by voting recently to  continue its male membership only  policy.
