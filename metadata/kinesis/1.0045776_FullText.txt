Thesaurus and  Index available  Researchers of the contemporary Canadian women's movement now have two new  tools, courtesy of the Canadian Women's  Indexing Group. Canadian Feminist Thesaurus is a bilingual book featuring over  6,000 items. The Thesaurus uses a standardized vocabulary to help researchers  find or organize written materials by, for  or about Canadian women, the Canadian  women's movement, and Canadian women's  studies. The Thesaurus primarily uses  terms from the 1972-85 period of the  women's movement and is designed to improve access to Canadian feminist periodicals. In addition to the terms derived from  feminist literature, the book also uses terms  grouped under: countries and nationalities,  the main linguistic and cultural groups of  Native peoples, and Canadian legislation  and party politics. The 800-page book costs  $55 plus applicable taxes and handling.  The companion to the Thesaurus is  the Canadian Feminist Periodical Index, 1972-85). This bilingual index covers 15 Enghsh and French periodicals (including Kinesis) and contains over 14,000  records with access by subject, author and  title. Designed for both general users and  specialists studying Canadian women and  the femimst movement, the Index is detailed and easy-to-use. The Index is ap-  prox. 1,200 pages and costs $85 plus taxes  To order, write to OISE Publishing, the  Ontario Institute for Studies in Education,  252 Bloor St. W., Toronto, ONT M5S 1V5  or call (416) 923-6641.

Women and aging  bibliography  Simon Fraser University's Gerontology  Research Centre recently published Women and Aging: An Annotated Bibliography, 1986-1991, compiled by Monica Mori and Janet McNern. This bibliography follows the centre's earlier publication  Women and Aging: A Comprehensive  Bibliography by Donna Lea Hawley, 1985.  The new bibliography includes 378.references to journal articles annotated and  arranged into fourteen chapters: attitudes  toward elderly women, crime and victimization, demographic characteristics, drugs,  economic status, education, employment  status, health care, housing, informal support networks, physical health and illness,  pohcy, psycho-social aspects, and social relationships.

The first conference, "Justice  for All", was held in Kingston Ontario in  the fall of 1990. In a flush of excitement  the tiny Vancouver contingent volunteered  to host the second conference.  The Kingston conference included sessions on the current state of the law regarding spousal benefits, a session on pornography, a Native healing circle, a lesbian organizing session, a session on campaigns in the  US to get pohce to keep records of violence  against gays and lesbians, etc.  The first organizational meeting for the  conference will be held Thurs. Nov. 21 at  the Vancouver Gay and Lesbian Centre,  7:30 pm. This meeting will discuss in a general way what people want to see at a conference; establish a steering committee; discuss who should be asked to sponsor, fund  and house the conference; and set up a process for people to have input into the agenda  and a decision-making process.  The best possible conference would be  one which speaks to the concerns of the  lesbian and gay community here, and also  advances the state of legal knowledge and  strategies for gay and lesbian legal struggles. That could include getting American lawyers, judges, and activists to talk  about their experiences. For example, anti-  homophobia training is a mandatory part  of training for judges in California.  Everyone is welcome at the meeting.  Bring ideas, energy, creativity.

Inside  Kinesis  Kinesis has begun a community Unks  project—a way for us to get feedback from  women in various community organizations  as well as to inform them about the paper  and the opportunities it provides. This is  part of our on-going work to be more responsive to different communities and representative of more women. Our first meeting was with the women's committee of  SUCCESS, Vancouver's Chinese-Canadian  service organization.

Wow, women women everywhere. New to  production this month are Sonja Hebert,  Candice McClure, Sylvia Kinzie, Camie  Kim, Janice Wong and Fatima Jaffer. And  writing for the first time (or for the first  time in a long time) are Cyndia Cole, Kaija  Pepper, Yasmin Jiwani, Sarah Huocheson,  Yvonne Brown, Barbara London, Eva Novy  and Erin Soros. Welcome, one and all.  Cathy Griffin has taken on the daunting  task of compiling Bulletin Board. She'll be  pouring through the stacks of submissions  every month to bring you a clear and concise  directory of events and services. And she'll  know everything first. Birgit Schinke, Kinesis' advertising coordinator, has added  distribution to her repertoire. It's a race  against time to get those bundles of Kinesis  hot off the press and into the newsstands.  First distribution, next the Indy, then traffic court ...  And there's always the goodbye. This  month, we bid a premature goodbye to Debbie Bryant, our production coordinator of a  few months. Fate has dealt Debbie a great  almost-full-time job which she, understandably, could not pass up. We were tempted  to sabotage her job interview because we  reeaaalllly don't want her to go. She's been  a wonderful co-worker: her years of experience in graphic arts and obvious dedication to training volunteers made for an easy  and fun time during production. As well,  Debbie has been a thoughtful contributor to  the Great Debates that flare up at Kinesis, and we dearly hope she'll be around for  more. Good luck with your new job, Deb,  and don't be a stranger.  PS: So, natch there's a job opening.  Please see the ad on page 23 for details.

It was a wipe out, with the NDP taking  51 of 75 seats and sending all but seven Socreds back to the corporate boardrooms and  used car lots.  Incredibly, the Liberals, who haven't held  a seat in the legislature for over 10 years  and reneged on much of their platform the  day before the election, took 17 ridings—  thus becoming the official opposition. A testament, perhaps to the old saying: 'governments aren't elected, they're defeated.'  Regardless of why they won, the NDP is  here and feminists are savoring the victory  and promises of more accessible and affordable daycare, pay equity, core funding to  women's centres, sexual assault centres and  transition houses, extension of benefits and  protections to part-time, domestic, cultural  and farm workers, and full funding of abortion services.  Look also for the end of Bill 82 (the Compensation Stabilization Act which slashed  gains in union contracts) and changes to the  labour code that will restore to unions some  of the organizing clout lost under the hated  Bill 19—changes that will benefit women in  the retail, office and service sectors in particular.  At this point, optimism is high and there  is a feehng that for the first time in years  women have an opportunity to make substantial gains. No one expects everything  in the first year or even the first term,  although there is agreement that some  promises—such as programs and services  around violence against women—should be  carried through quickly.  At the same time, however, there is a  sense that it would be unwise to sit back.  especially in hght of much NDP talk of fiscal responsibihty, balanced budgets, building wealth and cautious change—language  that too often bodes ill for social spending  in general and for women in particular.  The concern isn't so much that the NDP  will renege on its promises, but that women  will be vying for attention alongside other  interests—in particular, a powerful corpo-  "As soon as the NDP here starts doing things that will benefit people, whether  its welfare or labour issues, there will be a  tremendous amount of pressure from business," she says.  To offset that pressure, say Swanson and  other feminists, women must come together  in a strong lobby of their own to serve as  a counterbalance to corporate and other  An all-candidates meeting focusing on women's issues, hosted by  Vancouver Status of Women, was well-attended — and the candidates  (pictured above) were well-grilled.  rate lobby that expects government to tow  a tight hne on spending.  As Jean Swanson of End Legislated  Poverty points out, business in Ontario  "freaked out" when the government raised  welfare rates and she predicts the same for  BC once the NDP increases GAIN rates and  the minimum wage.  Four Women and One Lyin' Brian  Mr. Prime Minister found himself on trial in Vancouver on the National Day  of Action (October 26). The charges? Willful destruction of social programs,  shameless sell-offs of natural resources, nasty attacks on working people, total  disregard of women's issues—and too much kissy-kissy with a guy named Bush.  Oh—and those "free" trade negotiations with the US and Mexico. Funny how  Brian never talks about that. Does Mila know? We'll tell you more, next issue.  forces that attempt to push women's demands off the priority hst and to act as  a continual reminder to government that,  tight financial times or not, it has promises  to keep. Ultimately, they add, only women  speak for women.  Sandra Greene, a vice-president of the  Indian Homemakers' Association in Prince  Rupert, is confident the NDP will stay true  to its promises, but agrees that women  should not wait for things to be handed to  them.  "In general, women have to speak up  more. We have to know what we want, who  to talk to and what to say," says Greene,  whose top priorities are grassroots funding  for the community to better deal with issues hke family violence, and settlement of  Native land claims.  The Indian Homemakers' Association  plans to ask for direct funding from the  province (the federal government cut their  core funding years ago) and an investigation into the appalling hving conditions of  Native women in prison.  Gloria Nicolson, executive director of the  Native Women's Professional Association,  says it remains to be seen whether Native  women will fare better under the NDP than  they did under the Socreds, although she  personally beheves they will make headway  on self-determination issues.  What Nicolson wants most is a commitment from government that Native people  will have input into any programs or services that involve them. "The only ones  that work are the ones run by our people,"  she says. She also beheves women's groups  and organizations must work together to  achieve mutual goals but adds that non-  Native women must acknowledge and respect Aboriginal women's different perspectives on some issues.  Also pleased to see an NDP government are the Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre (DEWC)—which now expects the  promised core funding—and the Tenants  Rights Association, which expects changes  to the human rights act that will prevent  landlords from discriminating against families with children.  Winnifred Tovey, community legal worker  with the Tenants Rights Association says  that while changing human rights legisl;  tion is a good move, it won't accomplish  much if the NDP keeps to its pledge not to  increase government bureaucracy. Upsizing,  says Tovey, is what is needed to give people  more access to the system.  DEWC board member Karen Leman  says her organization is willing to give the  government time to get settled and do  some planning before meeting its funding  promise, but DEWC wants to see movement  within a year.  In the meantime, she says, the centre expects more direct access to government."We  think Darlene Marzari will be made minister of Women's Programs and she's been a  strong advocate," says Leman. "I'm hopeful that that will translate into a more ongoing relationship between government and  women's centres and more of a grassroots  perspective."  For Mobina Jaffer, national vice-president of the Immigrant and Visible Minority Women's Association of Canada, the  election of an NDP government and  ticularly four MLAs (one woman) from the  Indo-Canadian community, means positive  changes are on the way.  "My children and I are now part of the  government process and the community,"  Jaffer says. Among her priorities: more ESL  programs for women ("for every one man  in BC who can't speak Enghsh there are  two women") and quick action on violence  against women. Jaffer chairs the provincial  task force on "family" violence.  Gem Wirszilas, spokesperson for the DisAbled Women's Network of BC (Dawn BC)  also wants women's centres and transition  houses to get more funding, but most of  she wants them to be accessible to women  with physical and other disabihties who experience a high incidence of violence and  sexual assault but lack access to services.  "Disabled women are miles behind in education, employment and housing. There  are victim's services for other women but  they aren't there for us because of the extra cost to make them accessible," says  Wirszilas. She is confident the NDP will  move in these areas and also look at more  out-patient services for psychiatric patients  and better employment programs for people with mental disabihties—although she  expects it will take time.  As far as Karen Larcombe, staff member at Battered Women's Support Services  (BWSS) is concerned, the time is now.  Larcombe is also happy to be dealing  with the NDP rather than the Socreds but  is fed up with waiting for programs and  services that will allow organizations hke  BWSS to adequately address the needs of  women dealing with violence and sexual assault. "It's time to stop task-forcing and  writing about this issue to death," says Larcombe. "We need to put pressure on the  government to make sure this issue is no  longer tokenized."  Workers at Vancouver's Women Against  Violence Against Women (WAVAW) rape  crisis centre agree. "We don't need any more  See NDP page 4  KINESIS ssssssssssss**^^^  NEWS  Marzari and MacPhail:  Power: the nature of politics  by Jackie Brown  The NDP will hve up to its promises to  the women of BC, but in no way should  women's groups and organizations assume  their lobbying days are over, says re-elected  MLA Darlene Marzari.  "The nature of pohtics is power," says  Marzari, "and women cannot for a moment  assume that just because there is a 'woman  friendly' government that social attitudes  will automatically change and that women's  priorities will hit the top of the hst in a period of serious restraint."  Marzari says now is the time to strengthen the women's movement and apply pressure via the women's ministry (which she is  hkely to head) and all MLAs. "Women can  assume that the NDP will hve up to its priorities and promises but it's a question of  timing and when women's issues will hit the  priority hst," she said.  MLA Joy MacPhail, another strong feminist newly-elected, agrees that women must  continue to lobby government but is confi  dent the government will be able to carry  through with its spending priorities.  Neither corporate sector pressure nor the  party's own commitment to "fiscal responsibility" will interfere with that process,  MacPhail says, despite a much larger than  expected provincial deficit.  "Most of the red flags around fiscal conservatism were raised by the media because  they too are large corporations and have a  vested interest in promoting that position,"  says MacPhail, an economist. "Throughout the campaign we promised we would  be responsible economic managers. But we  have priorities, and they are working women  rather than business people.  "You can be fiscally responsible and still  meet the needs of the people you represent.  Big business has had a pretty easy time  of it in this province and that's probably  why they're a bit leary of what will happen in the future. They're not going to suffer under our government but they will be  asked to pay their fair share. And with everyone paying their fair share, we'll be able  to meet our commitments to certain British  Columbians."  And, says MacPhail, women can rest assured that members of the government will  also be lobbying hard to make sure the government delivers on its promises. That process will be assisted by a caucus that includes 16 women and a cabinet that will  be representative of the women elected, she  said.  So what can we expect in the first year or  so? According to Marzari, government will  move quickly in terms of violence against  women—a process that will involve acting  on recommendations from the provincial  task force on family violence, as well as providing core funding to women's centres and  transition houses.  The Everywoman's Health Centre and  Elizabeth Bagshaw abortion chnics in Vancouver will also get funding that will cover  the full cost of an abortion. .£•  The government will also begin work on  a pay equity process and the building of  a comprehensive daycare system, although  Marzari stressed that both are long-term  NDP from page 3  studies or task forces, we need money for  grassroots services," says staff worker B.J.  Tyner, adding that a WAVAW priority is  redirection of multicultural funds to make  organizations hke WAVAW more accessible  to women of colour.  The Vancouver Status of Women—which  lost ah its provincial funding under the Socreds in 1983—wants the NDP to respect  its commitment to communities by funding  women's advocacy work at the grassroots.  "If the NDP truly wants to be a force  for social change," says VSW's Trisha Joel,  "they'U have to create more solid links  with community-based women's groups.  [Premier-elect] Mike Harcourt talks a lot  about consultation. WeU, women's groups  are so incredibly busy with day-to-day work  it's hard to always be an effective partner  in 'consultations.' Advocacy and research  work by women suffered terribly under the  Socreds, and we want the NDP to reverse  that trend."  VSW's hst of demands includes an end  to forcing women on welfare to enrol in  the FamUy Maintenance Enforcement Program, a privatized scheme to collect support payments from dehnquent spouses.  The FMEP has been roundly criticized for  violating women's legal rights—and for its  inefficiency.  Both Tyner and Joel also expect improvements under the NDP but how much  and when, they say, is stiU open to question. And both say a strong women's lobby  Says Rowles: "Pohtics being what they  are, it doesn't matter what government is  in—they wUl be under tremendous pressure from corporations to change nothing.  The NDP has pohcy and an inclination to  change but it's up to the women's community, labour and other interest groups to  "...women's groups are so incredibly busy  with day-to-day work it's hard to always be  an effective partner in 'consultations.' "  lobby hard so that there is a counterbalance."  Adds Harvey, a member ol the lobby  group, Women for Better Wages: "Just because we have the NDP doesn't mean we  can now just wait for them to make the  changes. The business lobby is going to  come out screaming as they did in Ontario.  The three-piece suits and cellular phones  wUl be out in force. It's time to get motivated and become an inclusive force. That's  the way we'U maximize our potential."  The NDP has also promised to provide  protection to domestic workers, artists and  is necessary. To that end, VSW is organizing an early November meeting with other  lower mainland women's groups to plot a  strategy for lobbying the new government  in an effective—and collective—manner.  Trade unionists Mary Rowles, women's  rights director with the BC Federation of  Labour, and Anne Harvey, an activist with  the Office and Technical Employees union,  hke that idea. While both beheve the NDP  wUl move on areas hke pay equity, they  caution that women should not rely on  promises alone.  flfe%, IJjeWw In, ZQwJjuJLajL {$ ^ ^wk.@  PUP...

Lois Shelton, staff lawyer for the Domestic Workers Association of BC,.says:  "That's what we want and we want it early  in the term. It's a simple change. We've  been working on this issue for a long time  and we'll keep working on it."  And at long last BC's two abortion chnics  are expected to receive funding early in the  term so that women no longer have to pay  a portion of the total cost of an abortion.  Hilda Thomas, president of the Everywoman's Health Centre, also expects establishment of an advisory committee made up  of representatives from the women's community, to look at potential models for reproductive health centres in other areas of  BC.  Thomas and Joy Thompson, of the BC  Coalition of Abortion Chnics, say the NDP  is also expected to introduce legislation preventing hospital boards from banning abortions. Thompson also wants the government to provide travel funds to women  who must leave their communities to obtain  abortions—denied by the Socreds who did  not consider abortion a necessary medical  service.  If increased access to and full funding  of abortion is good news for women, both  Thompson and Thomas stress there is stiU  work ahead. Referring to the high debt load  left by the Socreds, Thomas says women  must make sure that is not used as an excuse for delaying services.  "It's a question of priorities," says  Thomas. "Women are always told there is  no money and then we see that there is  money for things hke domed stadiums."  Thompson puts it more forcefuUy: "There  are some very strong feminist MLAs and  a number wUl get into the cabinet but the  majority [of ministers] are going to be men  who are not known for their sensitivity to  women's issues.  "The strength of the women in government must be supported by our movement  ... And what our movement has won is  some room to acquire resources to continue  our fight."

KINESIS News  yyyy//yyyyyy/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,  Touchdown to reality:  The Hill/Thomas playoffs  by Yvonne Brown, Noga Gayie  and Barbara London  Judge Clarence Thomas has received his  hfe sentence to sit on the bench as a Chief  Justice to the Supreme Court of Appeals  of the United States of America, the most  powerful nation in the world.  During the weU-pubUcized Senate hearings, we had aU the makings of an aU-  American footbaU game, complete with its  clever power plays and dramatic touchdowns; its fans, sponsors, promoters and  commentators. Unlike footbaU games, where  fans crowd into two camps, one for each  team, in this pohtical game we had fans  cheering from several camps in the stands:  femimsts, racists, civU Ubertarians, Uberals,  conservatives and mascots.  We were particularly intrigued by the  power plays in this game. They were discernible in three locations. The first was in  the African-American community; the second, in the workplace; and the third, the  pohtical arena.  To the dramatic kick-off signaUed by  president George Bush's announcement of  Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination, a  swift and forceful offensive came from the  African-American community which scored  against Judge Thomas' civU rights records  and his limited judicial experience.

HaUed as  a landmark decision by some, the case raises  questions about the scope of its influence  and about WCB pohcies and procedures relating to women.  As a result of the exceptionally brutal  attack in May, 1984, the woman was left  sterUe and psychologicaUy unable to function in a workplace. (She has requested  anonymity.) The initial WCB ruhng on the  case assessed her disabihty as meriting a  mere 7.5 percent pension; the ruhng was  subsequently re-evaluated at 10 percent.  The woman was originaUy examined by  two male WCB staff psychologists whose  assessment resulted in the meagre award.  During the appeal, independent psychologist Laura Brown described the woman's  experience and its aftermath as "similar to  that found in survivors of torture." Brown  is a specialist in post-traumatic stress disorder.  Anita Braha, the lawyer at the BC Pubhc  Interest Advocacy Centre who appealed the  woman's case, beheves the unanimous decision awarding full compensation has set a  national precedent: "Primarily because the  decision establishes rape trauma syndrome  as a compensable disabihty," says Braha,  "and secondly because it establishes the extent of compensability."  There have been no other workers' compensation cases involving rape trauma syndrome reported in Canada. Although the  ruhng is not legaUy binding elsewhere in  Canada, Braha beheves it wUl influence  other provincial compensation boards.  The director of Women's Rights at the  BC Federation of Labour, Mary Rowles,  is considerably more cautious in her interpretation of the decision's impact. As each  WCB case is decided on its individual merit  and no reference to precedent is aUowed,  Rowles feels that unless the ruhng is translated into concrete pohcy, how this case wiU  affect future decisions is debatable.  The WCB itself does not regard the early  October ruhng as landmark, although they  acknowledge their pohcy on rape trauma  and disabihty is presently under review.  While the impact of this case remains  to be seen, it has undoubtedly brought the  issues of rape in the workplace and rape-  related post-traumatic stress syndrome into  the spotlight. It has also brought the WCB  evaluation and policy-making procedure under scrutiny, and has raised additional aUegations of sex discrimination by Braha.  The dramatic increase between the initial 7.5 percent to 100 percent rating  in consequence of this independent examination raises questions about the adequacy of WCB sensitivity to sexual assault trauma. WCB spokesperson Scott Mc-  Cloy attributes the sharp contrast in compensation awards to the "additional information" brought forward by psychologist  Brown, and denies any intention by WCB  to downgrade the extent of the woman's disabihty.  Braha views the original low assessment  as a failure to recognize the reaUty of the  trauma experienced by the claimant, "as  weU as the psychologicaUy debiUtating effects of sexual and physical assault. Assaulted women need people with expertise  in this area; psychologists must understand  and know about rape trauma syndrome."  WCB's McCloy 3ays the board "tries"  to have women psychologists assess women  who have been raped—if any are available.  Braha also contends that the decision  not to award the woman compensation for  sterUity is discrimination on the basis of sex.  The WCB has established pohcy for compensating male impotence based on the potential loss of the abihty to procreate.  There is no simUar pohcy for female  sterUity. The claimant, whose sterUity resulted from assault injuries, would appear  to fit within these guidelines, yet no award  was granted.  Braha is fihng a complaint with the BC  Human Rights Commission. "The fact that  a woman is sterile is a definite loss of the  abihty to procreate, and therefore should be  compensated," says Braha. "In my view, the  faUure of the WCB to compensate women  for sterUity when they compensate men for  impotence is sex discrimination. [The absence of] pohcy in their manual then puts  a heavy burden on the claimant to justify  that her sterUity is compensable."  The unanimity of the review board decision suggests the compensation ruhng is not  hkely to be appealed. Nevertheless, cases involving psychological disabihty come up for  review periodicaUy. What this wiU essentiaUy mean for the woman is that at some  point in the future, she may once again be  submitted to the same ]  came also from feminists who did not wait  for the proverbial pass to their end zones.  They mounted their offensive on Judge  Thomas' lack of pubhc expression on feminist issues, such as his public declaration of  never having discussed the case of Roe vs  Wade and, as the hearings were to reveal,  his ignorance on the oppressive aspects of  male dominance.  When the score was a 7-7 tie, we saw the  game move into overtime with new players  entering and occupying strategic positions  in centre field. The Senate teams huddled  in readiness for the final play-offs when the  game was upset by a phenomenon akin to a  natural disaster: the leak of alleged sexual  harassment.  As the hearings into sexual harassment  proceeded, the fans and players threw dirt  and worked themselves into a pit buU frenzy,  whUe Thomas was cast in the position of the  underdog who had to be rescued.  It is the workings of the male power  structure in effecting that rescue which are  instructive. On the one hand, we saw within  the African-American community condemnation leveUed at Professor Anita HUl for  so-caUed betrayal of the African-American  male and for outright disloyalty to her race,  thus in their minds violating the age-old tradition of "race first."  One was not privUeged to see strong support for an in-depth analysis of sexual harassment as it affects working women of aU  races and classes. But rather, we witnessed  the shifting of loyalties within the African-  American community in which men and  women were willing to overlook Thomas's  aUeged transgression and support his candidacy, in spite of his other short-comings.  Once the debate shifted to sexual harassment, the once powerful voices against  Judge Thomas remained sUent rather than  speak out on the issue.  The Senate hearing was cast in the mould  of a classic rape trial, where it is the female victim's words against her male aggressor within a male-dominated justice system. The verdict in this case was true to  form as in most rape cases, where the ag  gressor is acquitted even when his acquittal  is shrouded in doubt.  The arguments against Professor HiU's  charges are not new, in fact, they are boring. One yawns at the suggestion of Professor HUl fantasizing. One despairs at the  charge that Professor HiU had not laid  charges against Judge Thomas 10 years ago  when the harassment occurred. The foregoing show the ignorance or the denial of  the oppressive nature of the male misuse of  power in the workplace.  It is still the case that, although there  is a merit principle for advancement in  the workplace, women are not factored in.  Women are therefore in the unenviable position of having always to calculate the high  price they must play for their professional  advancement and for the maintenance of  their personal integrity. The two are at  times extremely difficult to balance and  women have been—and stiU axe—forced to  **  *********  The Senate hearing  was cast in the  mould of a classic  rape trial...  ****w**im**j**i  remain sUent. H anything, the hearings have  made pubUc the very negative repercussions to women who dare to reveal violations against them.  In summary, the final touch-down in the  game came when the Senate of 98 percent white males voted in favour of Judge  Thomas, thus rescuing the underdog and  restoring the male-dominated status-quo.

KINESIS SSSSSSJS*S*S**SS:  WHAT' S NEWS?  $10 million  for foundation  On October 2, Los Angeles milhonaire  Peg Yorkin announced her donation of $10  million to the Feminist Majority Foundation, a lobby group she co-founded. Half  the money wiU be used to start an endowment for the organization and the other half  wiU be used to make RU 486 (the "abortion  pUl") avaUable in the US.  Yorkin's donation, which Feminist Majority president Eleanor Smeal describes as  "the largest gift in women's rights history,"  wiU aUow the foundation to mount a campaign to pressure the French and German  manufacturers of RU 486 to export the drug  to the US, and to lobby the Food and  Drug Administration to permit its use. At  present, the manufacturers are withholding  RU 486 from the US market because of fears  about the country's right-wing pohtical climate.  by Karen Duthie  YorMn is furious that what she calls the  world's "most advanced scientific nation" is  denying women access to a medical discovery which has been used in the treatment  of breast and ovarian cancers and the elimination of fibroid uterine tumors, in addition  to terminating pregnancies.  Midwifery degree  in Ontario  By 1993, a bachelor's degree in midwifery  wUl be avaUable from some Ontario universities, according to the province's health  minister. Frances Lankin announced in mid-  October that a midwifery curriculum is  presently being developed by medical doctors, nurses and midwives.  The university program, the first of its  kind in Canada, wUl enable midwives to be  "on par with medical practice," said Lankin.  "It would have to match the kind of credentials that are put in place for other professions." Ontario wUl also soon pass legislation to regulate midwifery as a full-fledged  medical profession.  Not aU midwives and women's health activists support the Ontario government's  approach of harmonizing midwifery with  mainstream medical practice.  Mother loses  out(Part 1)  On October 9, a California appeal court  ruled 3-0 that Anna Johnson, a 'surrogate' mother who bore a child last year for  Mark and Crispina Calvert, is a "genetic  stranger" to the baby and has no parental  rights.  The baby boy was conceived through in  vitro fertilization using the Calvert's egg  and sperm. Johnson was then implanted  with the fertilized ovum. She bonded with  the unborn chUd early in pregnancy and unsuccessfully attempted to keep the baby at  birth. The Calverts, a mixed race couple,  had paid Johnson, a Black woman, $10,000  to carry the chUd.  The appeal court based its decision on  blood tests that showed Johnson was not  the biological mother of her baby. Judge  David Sills ruled that Johnson's claim to  maternity had to be resolved the same way  a man's claim to paternity would be. The  court then concluded it would be in the best  interest of the boy to have only two parents.  Mother loses  out (Part 2)  An Alberta Native woman has lost her  fight to have her chUdren raised in a Native community, and wiU have no say in  their upbringing. The unidentified woman  has been battling with Alberta Social Services to have her two young chUdren moved  to her Winnipeg-area Indian reserve from  their Calgary home with an adoptive white  famUy.  The mother had staged a 28-day hunger  strike over the summer in a park in downtown Calgary to protest against the government agency's decision. Social Services originaUy scooped her chUdren in 1988, and she  has tried repeatedly since then to have them  returned either to herself or to her cousin's  home on the Ojibwa Brokenhead reserve.  Sources: The Globe and Mail; The  Vancouver Sun  Lesbians and the gender bias committee  by barbara findlay  ' In May, the Law Society of BC, the body  which governs lawyers in the province, set  up a committee to examine whether there is  "gender bias" in the law (see Kinesis, June  1991). The BC Gender Bias Committee is  composed of six part-time panehsts, three  men and three women, aU white. They are  now conducting pubUc hearings around the  province.  Many feminists are critical of the committee, viewing it as another exercise in  demonstrating what is already known to  people who should already know it. The  Law Society is providing no resources to  community groups to prepare briefs, so feminist groups are left with the task of analyzing the entire law and legal system, with httle time or resources. Because the focus of  the committee's work is on "gender bias,"  there are concerns the committee wUl miss  the experiences of women who have to deal  with sexism compounded by racism, homophobia, poverty, disabihty or anti-Semitism.  Lesbians in Vancouver are now organizing to ensure the committee hears the concerns of individuals and groups.  How does the law see lesbians? In some  provinces, lesbians and gay men are protected from discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation. The BC Human Rights  Act lacks that protection, but the NDP are  committed to amending the Human Rights  Code to cover discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation or family status.  The federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms doesn't specificaUy include sexual orientation and there have been cases testing whether lesbians and gay men are covered by its general equahty guarantees. The  Supreme Court of Canada has not yet ruled  on that question but there are some lower  court decisions that have been encouraging. The most recent, Haig and Birch vs.  Canada, a case of the Ontario Court of Justice, holds that the Charter does extend  protection on the basis of sexual orientation and goes on to say that if human rights  codes do not contain that protection, they  are contrary to the Charter.  So this is a crucial time for lesbians who  have to hold their breath to see, literally,  whether they are going to have the same  civU rights as other Canadians. If the answer ultimately is yes, then lesbians wUl be  able to challenge laws hke the Immigration  Act that permit heterosexual married people to sponsor their partners but do not extend the same rights to lesbian partners.  Even with equahty guarantees, lesbians  stiU face homophobic attitudes in the  courts. In custody cases, the courts have  held that although being a lesbian is not  itself grounds to lose custody, being pohticaUy active or being "indiscreet" may  amount to a Ufestyle not in the best interests of the chUd. The underlying message  is that although lesbian behaviour can be  tolerated if it is private, lesbians must not  come out of the closet.  The law has not known how to deal with  lesbian and gay partnerships and families.  When lesbians and gay men have gone to  court seeking equahty in spousal benefits,  they have argued that if employment benefits hke medical insurance are provided to  "spouses", then they should be avaUable to  lesbian and gay partners. Courts have gone  both ways on the question. Some have held  that it just isn't possible for lesbians to be  "spouses" since the very idea imphes a man  and a woman. In BC, a recent decision of  the BC Supreme Court says that lesbians  and gay men are entitled to equal treatment  in the provision of medicare benefits. The  court held that the regulations under the  Medical Services Act were contrary to the  equahty guarantees in the Charter because  cheaper premiums were provided to heterosexual spouses but were not avaUable to gay  and lesbian spouses.  There is a debate inside the lesbian community about whether it is a good strategy to be going to the courts to argue that  lesbians are "just hke" heterosexual families and deserve the same protection and  benefits. First of all, some lesbians argue,  not aU lesbian relationships are "hke" heterosexual partnerships and such a strategy  leaves those people out. Secondly, the "fam  Uy" as it is known to the law has aU sorts of  aspects to it—ranging from the laws about  custody, maintenance, division of property,  inheritance, and so on, to laws which treat  spouses differently than two single people  for purposes of welfare benefits, insurance  premiums, etc. Do lesbians really want to  buy into all the aspects of "family" law?  In order to make sure lesbian voices  are heard by the Gender Bias Committee, a meeting is scheduled for Thurs.  Nov. 7 at the Vancouver Lesbian Centre, 876 Commercial Drive (7:30 pm).  Lawyers barbara findlay and Gwen  Brodsky will give an overview of the  law relating to lesbians and will provide  lawyers/law students as resource people to any group or individual wanting  to make a submission to the committee, which holds its Vancouver hearings  in January.

In a demonstration and letter-  writing campaign, women students and former staff of the WSO have expressed their  anger and disagreement with cuts made to  long-term counselhng under the new director.  According to Ray Edney, a fuU-time  WSO counsellor who resigned in September, counselling was cut without the support of staff. "[Director] Marsha Trew decided that she would do what the [university] administration wanted her to do," says  Edney, "in that she would have the office do  more advocacy work or planned organizational change rather than one-on-one counselhng."  To accommodate these changes, the office no longer offers long-term counselling—  women are now seen for a maximum of six  sessions. "CounseUing time was cut by 50  percent," says Edney. "Drop-in counselling  is avaUable, but the more on-going counselling has been severely cut back."  Director Trew defends the cuts by arguing that advocacy work is necessary to  "reach more students." Some of the WSO  changes whl address this mandate: women  have been appointed to work in coUabora-  tion with Nursing, with Social Work and,  in an arrangement Trew describes as a major coup, a woman is working directly with  Applied Science to address misogyny within  the faculty and to increase the enrolment of  female students.  WhUe feminists agree that UBC is in  desperate need of "planned organizational  change" and that advocacy on an institutional level is needed, women are furious  that counselhng was axed to finance that  work. Says Edney, "Advocacy is important.  If the university wants us to do that work,  then give us more staff. No effort was made  to [advance] that argument."  Subscribe!  $24.00 for 2 years— 8 issues  Single issues: $5.00 each  order from  Gallerie Publications  2901 Panorama Drive  North Vancouver, BC  Canada V7G 2A4  Trew defends the changes by claiming  that a 1989 WSO review committee recommended the office do more advocacy work.  While the committee did suggest the office  revitalize its advocacy role and that "the office would gain prestige and a higher profile by its affiliation with the academic programs," it also reported that the long-term  and crisis counselling services of the WSO  were not offered elsewhere. Said the report,  "The possibility of recommending that the  WSO be made a sub-unit in Student CounseUing was considered ... and rejected on  the basis that that would amount to abolition of the office."  Nancy Horsman, a WSO counsellor who  retired this faU, has been the most vocal  critic of the changes because, she says, she  has not had to protect her career—unlike  other staff women. Horsman argues that the  changes reflect the administration's goal of  co-opting the WSO for its own ends. The  office has always done advocacy work, says  Horsman, and this work "developed out of  working with students in counselling rather  than for students in a top-down model."  Advocacy has included the development of  a separate Sexual Harassment Office, the organization of panels and conferences, and  group workshops around such topics as date  rape, sexual harassment, sexual abuse, eating disorders, self-defense, self-esteem, career goals, writing and exam stress.  Horsman argues that the increase in advocacy is not really an increase at aU.  She beheves that in the wake of several  high-profile misogynist events at UBC, the  President's Office needs more "window-  dressing"—programs that are highly visible  to the pubUc but that may not be addressing the real needs of women students.  "UBC has to improve its image," says  Horsman. "So aU this attention is given to  setting up committees and increasing advocacy. But what's really happening is that we  put our energies into more gift wrapping for  the pubhc."  Trew and her new staff are not concerned  that their work is being co-opted and beheve that, without advocacy, feminist coun-  seUing is nothing more than "band-aid"  work. "Like me, a lot of counsellors would  hke to 'run counselling out of business,' "  says Janice Hope, a new staff member, "because that would mean the whole system  has made some changes. We want to change  the environment. The point with feminist  counselling is recognizing that a lot of  women's problems are because of a greater  social structure. H we're not working on  campus to create major social changes, we  are not doing our job as feminist counsellors."  But Horsman explains that increased advocacy leads to increased counselhng needs.  When women attend workshops, for instance, they become more aware of the sexism and abuse in everyday hfe on campus.  The new staff says that counselhng is still  avaUable for these situations. "Most people  who come here for counselling wUl now go  for a maximum of six sessions," says Hope.  "On the other hand we might not even go  for as long as six sessions because at the  first meeting we would look at what the issues are and the woman might decide that  she's fixed."  Edney argues that a six-session limit is  simply not adequate in many situations.  "When you're counselling women, you are  usuaUy deahng with some kind of sexual  abuse. You just are. You can't work with  women and avoid that." She explained that  in sexual abuse cases, group workshops and  six-week counselhng sessions are the real  "band-aids."  The new staff recognizes some women  have greater counselhng needs, but these  women wUl now be referred elsewhere. Trew \  says that the WSO cannot take responsibU-  ity for long-term counselling. "The [question] is, what's the appropriate mandate  around this office?" says Trew. "The Student CounseUing Centre (SCC) exists to do  student counselling. That's their mandate-  that's the only reason they exist. That's not  the mandate for this office. This office is for  serving students and for identifying issues  important to women."  The vice president of UBC, K.D. Srivas-  tava, agrees with Trew, saying the SCC has  expanded its services and now "feels it offers  sensitive counselling for women students."  The 1989 review committee report does  not support this opinion: "Student Counselhng asserts that it can provide the counselling services now sought from the Office  for Women Students. The committee found  clear and plentiful evidence, however, that  a significant segment of the campus population, including all the patrons of the WSO,  firmly beheves the WSO offers counselling  service and support that is not and cannot  be provided by the SCC."  EUen Pond, a student organizer of the  weU-attended demonstration against the  cut-backs at the WSO, maintains that student counselling is a completely unacceptable alternative. "It's not feminist counselhng," Pond says. "It's quite weU known  in the underground women's network that  you don't go to student counselling. It's  also quite weU known that if you are a lesbian you don't go to student counselling. So  that's a serious problem.  "[The SCC] are students and don't have  the training to counsel these women. The  UBC Women's Centre has been quite clear  in its demands. We want the WSO to reinstate long-term counselling. But our concerns have been ignored."  Edney says that not only is the proportion of female counseUors very low at the  SCC, but women students are not guaranteed feminist counselling. "Women who are  in crisis or need support are not in the best  position to be evaluating their counsellors,"  says Edney. "It is very easy when you are  emotionaUy distraught to be taken in by  someone who seems to be fine before you  realize that this person isn't a feminist. So  it's really good when you are in emotional  turmoU to go to an office where you know  that it's okay, that it's safe, that you wiU  get a feminist counsellor.  " And that's what is lost. Seriously lost."  Erin Soros is a former UBC student  who now works as a secretary.  Victory in Ont.  Harassment: both  sexual and racial  Colgate Palmolive has withdrawn its appeal of a landmark workers' compensation  ruhng which awarded one of its female  employees compensation for Ulness arising  from sexual and racial harassment on the  job.  The ruhng made by a Workers' Compensation Board Hearings Officer was the first  of its kind in Ontario. It recognized stress-  related Ulness arising from harassment as  a workplace injury and compensable under  the Ontario Workers' Compensation Act.  After the decision was announced in June  1990, the company said it would appeal. But  it withdrew its appeal in late September,  only days before the hearing was scheduled  to begin.  The woman has been supported by the  Women's Legal Education and Action Fund  (LEAF), which sees her case as an important test case for equahty in the workplace  for all women but particularly for women of  colour.  The woman, employed at a Colgate Palmolive soap factory, was one of few Black  people in the workplace and often the only  woman in her work area. She was exposed  to a poisoned work environment resulting  from racist sexual harassment. Over a six  year period, she was subjected to racist  and sexist slurs, obscene hand-drawn pictures and sabotage of her work and production hne, which management did httle  to address. When a soap carving of a penis was placed on the assembly hne in front  of her and her male co-workers, she finaUy  broke down. She suffered a nervous breakdown which has kept her from returning to  work for four years.  The first time she applied for workers'  compensation, it was denied. But she won  the right to benefits when she appealed to  the Hearings Officer.  Says Connie Nakatsu, LEAF staff lawyer,  "This decision is a landmark because it recognizes sexual and racial harassment on the  job as injurious to women's health and it  provides women financial recourse.  "The case also demonstrates that sexual  harassment combined with racial harassment makes women of colour particularly  vulnerable to workplace harassment. Often  women of colour are forced to work in a destructive work environment which severely  limits their opportunities."  The woman stiU has an outstanding complaint of sexual harassment against the  company at the  Ontario Human Rights  Commission.

And they do aU of these in a small  but rapidly growing pubhcation called Her-  spectives which deserves a closer look behind its unsophisticated exterior.  Forty or so typewritten and photo-copied  pages stapled together present the words  of women in traditional forms of poetry  and fiction, and also through opinion pieces,  journal writings and letters. Herspectives  writing can be raw, open and honest in contrast to the over-controUed precision often  found in many hterary magazines. Women  speak of their own hves and from their  hearts. There is a sense of women sharing  their stories whether they hve on a farm in  northern BC in a small town in Ontario or  in San Diego.  Dialogue moves through the pages but  comes through most strongly in the letters.  These are not your usual "Letter to the  Editor" type but long personal conversational pieces. From issue to issue, women  reply to each other directly. One contribu-  ter, more than that; not hterary magazine,  not "academic" or polished enough for that.  "It's so new it almost doesn't have a  name," says BUly, "[but] what we caU  ourselves is the dialogue of the common  woman."  support, on how the magazine wiU develop.  When I first read Herspectives, I also  had difficulty placing or labelling it. It  was put off by the strong New Age feel  of the pubhcation, with its focus on goddess rehgion and spiritual healing percolat-  Mary Billy  tor describes the letters as "a talking-healing circle." The July issue had letters from  Deanna, hving in the wUderness in northern BC telling about her 12,000 honey-bees;  from Julie talking about Canada's constitution; from Margaret-Marie reminiscing  about a woman whose hfe of emotional  abuse led her to kUl her husband. There  were also numerous messages of support for  editor Mary E. BUly who puts Herspectives together single-handedly, four times a  year and who has recently been struggling  against cancer.  I sat with Mary BUly in a coffee shop in  Horseshoe Bay, halfway between Vancouver  and her home in Squamish, and hstened to  her talk about Herspectives. She told the  story of the conception and birth of the pubhcation she struggles to name: not newslet-  BUly recounted discussions with her  friend, writer Gert Beadle, about "the need  for a pubhcation which addressed the needs  of ordinary women." They shared a frustration with the male-dominated publishing world which was unresponsive to much  of women's writing, as well as the feminist  press which seemed more focused on "an urban, academic way" and ignored the needs  of "a whole mass of women in smaU towns,  rural women ... needing to feel good about  their hves and find out what women were  doing across the country ..."  With eight paid up subscribers, BUly embarked on the production of Herpsectives.  She continues to work alone, now receiving  letters and submissions from rural and urban Canada and the United States. She is  perhaps being pushed gently into admitting  she may be editor/publisher of a new "httle  magazine."  BUly sees the focus of Herspectives  as "the affirmation of women and their  choices," with the additional purpose of presenting women writers who find it difficult  to be published. As editors go, she is unusual in that as a writer herself, she knows  how rejection can feel and tries to respond  quickly, often with an encouraging letter.  She is also open to taking directions from  subscribers, at present her sole source of  ing through the hterary content. I've never  been sold on this approach to the empowerment of women with its soft-hne on feminism. As I understand the "goddess" approach, women's power is beheved to stem  from our creative and nurturing instincts,  and our connection to the natural world.  The stress is on the need for women to  turn inward, to find strength from within  and to use it to heal ourselves and others.  I'm happier with outward rage (outrage) directed toward the patriarchy.

It speaks of centuries of cousins,  aunts, mothers, grandmothers, friends—the  Black women who are the central force of aU  my distant and close relations. Sisters know  each other in a way nobody else does. Our  abihty to hft each other up, even if we hve  far apart or rarely see each other, is an acquired survival skiU.  In a world where the assertions of white  supremacy and male dominance attempt  to thwart Black women's self-actuaUzation,  sisters most often rely on each other for support.  Sisters are the woman sibhngs I never  had. They're the ones who inspire me with  their teachings and perseverance despite  "the odds." Sisters are the unsung heroes.  "Sister" is one of those rare Enghsh words  that we, as Black women, can claim and  share with aUies who aren't our brothers.  "Sister" bespeaks pride, affection, and  determination.  Sisterhood is a bond that brotherhood often forgets.  Sisters remind me that the slavery many  of our ancestors survived cannot and must  not be relegated to "unimaginable" status.  In a sea of predominantly white Canadian  faces, I seek the sisters whose presence reminds me that we are unique ... we are  survivors, and the descendants of survivors.  It's only fitting that Dionne Brand's most  recent film would be named Sisters in the  Struggle.  The women in Brand's film speak and  sing the realities that Black sisters in  Canada are confronting everyday. Their  voices are echoes of the whispers that circulated in my ears over years of struggling for  my own personal place, identity and autonomy in this white-dominated society. Our  sisters' messages are dehvered simply and  clearly; and yet, these messages are simultaneously complex—layered with hundreds  of years of herstories that ache to be heard.  Sisters in the Struggle is the second of  a triad of films about contemporary Black  women in Canada in the "Women at the  WeU" series. The series is sponsored by the  National Film Board of Canada's Studio D.  Sisters was co-directed by Montreal's Studio D executive producer Ginny Stikeman.  A few years ago, Brand was assistant director of Older, Stronger, Wiser, the first  film in the series. She and director Claire  Prieto assembled a portrait-style documentary about some individual sisters who have  worked long and hard to improve the quality of hfe for their brothers, sisters, and chUdren in southwestern Ontario.  Seeing Older, Stronger, Wiser was a  mildly shocking experience for me. I sat in  the midst of a mostly non-Black audience  Vancouver's Robson Square Media Centre and saw my favourite first grade teacher,  Cleata Morris, on the screen. I also recognized several other famihar faces in scenes  showing the annual Labour Day parade in  the small Black settlement of Buxton, Ont.  My family and I drove there from our homes  in the Windsor, Ont. area almost every  year. The film reminded me of some almost-  forgotten chUdhood experiences. It recorded  some of the elders of my home community,  and offered ghmpses of "Black versions" of  our his/herstories north of the States. All  these voices, experiences, and events might  have faded into obhvion or remained the unheralded oral his/herstories of Black people  in Canada, except Brand and Prieto had the  foresight to document them using an accessible medium hke film.  And the best part was that Black women  were creating the images. It was hke kissing the NFB dinosaurs Fields of Endless  Day and Voice of the Fugitive goodbye.  Those films have some archaic, stereotypical portrayals of Black women's experiences  in Canada which beg modernization.  In Sisters, Brand interviews Rosemary  Brown, executive director of Match in Ottawa; Carolyn Jerome, anti-apartheid activist in Vancouver; Amanthe Bathalien,  Montreal-based social worker; June Beecok,  ...layered with  hundreds of years  of herstories that  ache to be heard.  director of human rights for the Ontario  Federation of Labour's anti-racism program; civU rights activists, Akua Benjamin  and Sherona HaU; 1988 Toronto mayoral  candidate, Carolann Wright and members  of the Toronto Black Women's CoUective.  Sisters might be seen as the sequel to, or  contemporary of, Older, Stronger, Wiser.  It offers a more up-beat, up-to-date look  at the concerns of some pohticaUy active  Black women today. The influences of rehgion, domesticity and maternity—which are  so often represented as the central focus of  Black women's realities in Canada—are finally overshadowed by the telhng of our immediate struggle for autonomy outside of  the home. Sisters also tackles some basic issues hke community-based self-defense  and self-definition. One woman in the film  spoke out about being a lesbian. This act  was a challenge to heterosexist denial that  assumes aU sisters in our communities are  straight. It was a courageous move, given  the homophobia of people in our communities which constantly threatens that lesbians and gay men should stay in the closet.  Her words articulate one aspect of the multiplicity of our identities as Black women in  Canada.  Sisters is successful in presenting ghmpses of the pohtical "big picture" as it relates to Black women's experiences with  racism and sexism in urban Canadian envi  ronments. Street scenes of demonstrations  against pohce brutality and their acquitted  murderers reveal the frustration that many  Black people feel as we are constantly under attack. And, however subtly, references  are made to the importance of linking issues  of Black Canadians to First Nations issues  and those of our other sisters and brothers  of colour who have been terrorized by institutionalized and personalized racism. The  murders of J.J. Harper and Betty Osborne  are cited in relation to the Montreal pohce  murder of Anthony Griffin and the Toronto  pohce shooting of Sophia Cook. Brand's images and her subjects' statements help us remember the outrage that is so often forgotten in this media-saturated society where  state-sanctioned violence is rarely exposed,  despite its constant threat.  Sisters Is validating. It reclaims some of  the experiences and sentiments that many  Black women in Canada share.  A uniquely Canadian feature of this film  is its recognition that Black people's experiences here are not limited to anglophone regions. The very eloquent words of  Amanthe Bathalien are translated in Enghsh subtitles for the non-French speaking  audience. However, in this film's attempt to  integrate Black women's culturaUy diverse  experiences (ie., as recent immigrants, indigenous Blacks, young women, and francophone women), it does not say "everything  for everybody." For example, the majority  of sisters represented in the film are members of the Toronto-based Black Women's  CoUective. This' leaves one with the impression that there are few, if any, other Black  women's groups or organizations in Canada.  In particular, there were no references to  the Congress of Black Women, an organization which has been nationally active for  decades.  Sisters wUl not stand as the monolithic  Black Canadian women's film of aU time.  I'm sure Brand and her co-director are  aware of the limitations of "one-shot-deal"  film making opportunities. Black women  can't afford to be a flash-in-the-pan fashion. There's much more work to be done  ... more catching up to do. And we can't  expect that any single film (or series of  films) wUl fiU aU the gaps that exist in our  his/herstories as Black Canadians. We must  continue to relate our stories to the rest of  the world; a world which is virtuaUy ignorant of our contemporary existence ... ig  norant of the multiplicity of our identities  and experiences. Our exclusion from dominant white (and predominantly white feminist) discourses and images has been too  long-standing. Sisters in the Struggle is a  landmark film which conveys vital information.  But we must go on from there. We need  to continue pushing our boundaries to explore more innovative ways of story-telling.  We can't afford to continue restricting ourselves to documentary formulas of film production. Remember, it's the younger generation that needs to hear some of these messages, and I know from personal experience  that 50 minutes of "talking heads" won't  capture a young person's attention for too  long.  I praise Brand, and others hke her, for  keeping the flame of creativity burning in  our communities. At least they recognize  the imperative nature of this kind of work,  of these kinds of records. Brand has courageously responded to her calling as a community activist, artist of many talents, and  risk taker. She is quoted in a brief biography  which accompanies the film's press release  as saying: "Daily I am struck by the bril-  Uance and honesty of women with nothing  to lose—which is what makes my obsession  with the Black woman as subject a hfe-long  project." As more Canadian Black women  acquire and develop their skiUs as image  producers, I expect that we wUl see experimental works, animation and other forms  which display more imaginative and stimulating ways of telling our stories.  Some ideas expressed in this review  emerged from a discussion with other  Vancouver-based Black women during  and after a private screening of Sisters  in the Struggle at a pot-luck lunch October 5. I am thankful to Barbara Binns,  Noga Gayle, Sygnia Ricketts, Yolanda  Ricketts, Selina Williams, and Suleh  Williams for sharing their ideas and  opinions regarding this review.  Sisters in the Struggle will have its premiere screening for the Vancouver public Nov. 5 at 7:80 pm, at the Robson  Square Cinema. Admission is free, and  Brand will be in attendance to answer  questions from the audience.  JANISSE bROWNING is one helluva  typesetter.  KINESIS Nov. 91 International  Mexico:  Campaigning for prostitutes  by Claudia Colimora  Claudia Colimora was a candidate  for the Representative Assembly of  the Federal District of Mexico on the  Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT—  Mexican section of the Fourth International) slate during the 1991 election  campaign in August. This feminist, who  has fought hard for contraception and  abortion rights, is also a prostitute involved in urban struggles, who demands  the legalization of her profession. She  lives in Mexico City.  We want to win the recognition of the  rights of prostitutes and its legalization.  Pushing it into secrecy is proof of hypocrisy  and "double standards" in society, and  means that the women are unscrupulously  oppressed and exploited by officials.  In Mexico, prostitution is controlled by  laws passed 56 years ago which are completely obsolete. Prostitution is Ulegal and  clandestine and that means that prostitutes  have no rights. It would be a much better  situation for them to be legaUy recognized,  even if they have to pay taxes on their earnings, than to be at the mercy of corrupt of-  ...I was attacked  fiercely, since I said  loud and clear that  every woman on the  planet can end up a  prostitute...  I am 35 years old and have three chUdren.  I started working as a prostitute when I was  a secretary at the social security, at a moment when I had big money problems during the Ulness of one of my chUdren. I was  working more than 12 hours a day at the office and, furthermore, was obliged to gratify the sexual desires of my boss to keep my  job. I soon realized that I could make much  more money as a prostitute.  Four and a half years ago I got involved  in the struggle against AIDS. It was vital  that the other women should know about  the causes and consequences of this terrible disease. This was very difficult work and  we had no money since we had no institutional support. We founded the civU association CuUotzin, which fights for health care  and civU rights for prostitutes of both sexes  as weU as street chUdren.  CuUotzin organizes many information  meetings about AIDS and its prevention; we  work with the National Anti-AIDS Coordination (CONASIDA), which provides us  with condoms which we distribute free to  the prostitutes. Today the women refuse to  go with a chent who wUl not agree to use  a condom. We have achieved very positive  results, and, as vice president of CuUotzin,  I have even met with representatives of the  World Health Organization (WHO).  Thanks to our efforts, there is now a hospital which interests itself in the medical  problems of prostitutes and examines them  regularly, not only to detect the AIDS virus,  but also hepatitis B and other contagious  diseases. The hospital also carries out free  gynecological and oral tests for prostitutes  and free operations are provided for them  and their chUdren.  CuUotzin also takes up the cause of domestic employees who suffer sexual harassment and violence at the hands of their  ficials and pohce.  The legalization of prostitution would  also permit a more effective control of  AIDS. The current AIDS legislation is in  fact the 1934 law on syphUis with that word  replaced by AIDS throughout.  We have also won the right to daycares for chUdren of prostitutes who work  during the day. In November 1990, after  a meeting between prostitutes' representatives and members of the Health Ministry,  the Provida movement [inspired by American "pro-life" conservatives, and violently  opposed to abortion], went and destroyed  the two existing prostitutes' daycares. They  continue to function, but now in places  known only to prostitutes.  We are currently setting up a project for  chUdren hving on the streets where they seU  smaU items or do deals. They are especiaUy  vulnerable to prostitution and drugs. We do  not want to shut them in inhuman orphanages. We are hoping to set up canteens and  open nightshelters, to give them free education and technical training that wUl help  them to find a proper job.  We have a similar project for prostitutes.  We don't intend to teach them to sew or  embroider, or to do crochet and cross-point.  They must have real choices so that they  can get weU-paid jobs when they decide, out  of age or fatigue, to leave this profession.  In Mexico, women work for pitiful wages.  In the frontier zones for example, the  women who work in maquiladoras drudge  for 15 hours a day and stiU don't earn  enough to hve, and have to work as prostitutes at the weekend—this is true for about  half of them.  As long as such low wages are being  paid, and in the absence of real social security for aU and daycare, women wUl continue to become prostitutes to eat and feed  their chUdren—95 percent of prostitutes are  mothers.  Becoming a candidate  Since I am also a feminist, I took part in the  National Convention of Women for Democracy in March 1991 which brings together  40 organizations, movements and women's  unions. The Convention proposed me as a  candidate for the elections and looked for a  party that would put me on its hst.  We suffered various rebuffs, but the Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT) and the  Sociahst Electoral Front (FES) accepted at  once. This cost them votes and provoked violent attacks from the right, above aU from  the Party of National Action (PAN) and the  Provida movement. For, apart from calling  for the legahzation of prostitution, a systematic campaign against AIDS, and sexual  education at aU levels, I also called for the  liberalization of abortion.  Provida produced photos of a completely dismembered foetus of at least eight  months and I was described throughout as  a "aborter" along with Rosario Ibarra and  other feminist candidates of the PRT.  This work with the PRT has been very  important for me, since, although I am not a  mihtant, I agree with many points of its pohtical platform, including free sexual choice,  the right to organization, the rejection of  violence against women, democratic rights,  the legahzation of abortion and the reappearance of the disappeared.  My election campaign was very difficult.  At the start, journalists treated me in a  friendly enough way, comparing me more  or less to la Cicciohna [an Italian porn star  who won a parliamentary seat on the Italian Radical Party ticket]. Later they realized that I was serious and absolutely determined to make myself heard and see prostitution legahzed so as to break the power of  the corrupt authorities.  Then, I was attacked fiercely, since I said  loud and clear that every woman on the  planet can end up a prostitute, and that  blessings and white dresses only serve to  hide the fact that one belongs sexuaUy to a  man.  During the campaign I got to know about  the needs of prostitutes throughout the  country. Their rights are systematicaUy violated. For example recently there were  two pohce operations in Queretaro where  aU the women and transvestites were arrested, stripped and spattered with paint.  We oppose these periodic onslaughts by the  authorities in districts where prostitution  takes place; prostitutes are citizens Uke anybody else.  In MexicaU, every two weeks the prostitutes are taken to a health centre where  they are massively dosed with a type of  peniciUin, even if they do not have any sexually transmissible disease. This weakens  their body's defences.  r>^' " DESKTOP PUBLISHING  I  periodicals      catalogues       j  ads      newsletters ^ J  In the state of Sonora, during AIDs tests,  the heads of the health department have  been insisting that people give their names,  addresses and date of birth, although AIDS  testing is meant to be anonymous, secret  and free. After a struggle we finally put a  stop to this.  When I went to do a meeting in Lower  Cahfornia, a conservative daily in Tijuanna  wrote that the PRT fiUs its ranks with prostitutes and homosexuals with AIDS.  This was the first time that a prostitute  has been a candidate in an election in Mexico, and it is clear that many women voted  for me; however there was such a massive  fraud by the ruhng Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that we did not win any  representation. In the polling station where  I voted with my son in the presence of several journalists, there was not a single vote  for the PRT by the time of the count.,  I wanted to win because I want the media  to finish with their horror stories and double standards and in order that our voice  should be heard. I am a voice for those that  have none.  | programs  £ customized graphics  3 Deborah Kirkland  SLIDING  253-5109 j  C   A   L   E  Reprinted with permission from International Viewpoint, and with permission  from Claudia Colimora.

Relatvies often keep a woman trapped in  her care-giving role, denying she has a problem as long as she is able to function.  But women in BC who are able to break  out find that there is very httle official help  for them in the community. In particular,  there is a crying need for women-only residential treatment facUities—places where  women can find intensive support—and the  genuine safety—they need to heal themselves. The province's Alcohol and Drug  Program (ADP) funds almost three times  as many "beds" for men as women. Of a total 280 residential treatment beds, only 20  are specificaUy for women. Fifty-one beds  are funded for men, and 194 are designated  co-ed. In most co-ed treatment centres, men  occupy two-thirds of the beds.  The smaU number of spaces avaUable to  women reflects two long-held myths in the  treatment of chemically dependent people:  that many more men than women have  the problem, and that chemically dependent  men and women require the same types of  treatment.  Yet many alcohol and drug counsellors  estimate that the proportion of chemically  dependent men and women is about equal.  According to a recent Alcoholics Anonymous publication, 45 percent of its membership are women. Many counsellors also argue that women require different treatment  programs for successful recovery.  Seven of the women-only beds in BC are  at Maiya House, a treatment centre near  Nanaimo, Vancouver Island. Since 1989 approximately 200 women have participated  in the centre's holistic, six-week intensive  treatment program which includes group  therapy, one-on-one counselhng—from a  feminist perspective—plus a healthy diet  and exercise.  The centre may soon close down, however. Its lease expires at the end of this year  and unless ADP provides Maiya House with  a letter of support the program wUl not continue. ADP has said it wUl not make a decision on this matter before mid-December.  The need for women-only treatment beds  is essential, says Susan Strega, executive di  rector of Maiya House. "More than 90 percent of the women we see have either been  raped or battered, or sexuaUy assaulted as  chUdren," says Strega "Two thirds to three  quarters of our chents have had aU these  things happen to them."  Because so many chemically dependent  women are or have been victims of sexual  abuse, outpatient counselhng services offered by ADP are often inadequate. Chents  are limited to 30 hours of counselling and  the day program's mandate is directed towards drug counselhng, not therapy.  Stressing the connection between women's chemical dependency and the violence they experience, Strega says safety is  a critical treatment issue. "Women have to  "More than 90 percent  of the women we see  have either been raped  or battered, or sexually  assaulted as children."  be in a safe environment to look at the concerns that are part of their chemical dependency," says Strega.  Co-ed treatment centres are rarely conducive to the women who need to talk about  sexual abuse. Hilton J, a woman who attended the Maiya House program in August 1990, drank for 31 years before kicking  alcohol in 1987. She had the option of going to a Native treatment centre near Terrace, but chose Maiya instead. She preferred  the smaUer number of chents at Maiya, but  she also saw the need to be in a women-  only house. "Talking about sexual abuse—  I'm able to do it now, but couldn't have  talked about it with men around. I would  have been more closed up," says Hilton.  Several graduates of the Maiya House  program point to other beneficial aspects of  the centre. For many, it was the first time  they felt comfortable with other women. SU-  via, who was chemically dependent from her  early teens untU 18 months ago, was physicaUy abused by her alcoholic mother. "It  took courage to be in an aU-women house,"  she says, "but at Maiya I learnt to trust  women for the first time."

"Giving up [the drugs  and alcohol] was hard enough at first" says  Nancy, "and I wasn't ready in the beginning  to do any of the other work that goes along  with treatment." She found, however, that  she eventuaUy needed to deal with some  resurfacing emotional issues. "I had a lot  of family issues to deal with, self-esteem  issues, and Maiya helped me see through  some of those." She says that although the  idea was initially intimidating, being with  other women enabled her to better confront  her issues.  The former chents aU found that being away from their daily environments—  including the demands of chUdren and  partners—helped them to come to terms  with their chemical dependency and with  the intensity of the program. As is required  for aU women wanting to attend Maiya  House, Heather had been seeing an outpatient ADP counsellor before beginning the  program, but found that she wasn't able to  talk about some of the most serious issues  in her hfe.  "I'd always get to the main issues just before the end of the [counselling] hour," says  Heather, "and so the next week we'd have  to start aU over again. Maybe I wanted it  hke that. I didn't want to get to the core."  Lack of Access—and  Shortages of Everything Else  Existing treatment programs are not an option for aU women, however. Three-month  waiting hsts are the norm. There are also  no treatment centres which offer cluld care.

WhUe she technically has the  option of temporarily placing her chUdren  with the Ministry of Social Services and  Housing, most women understandably do  not consider this to be an alternative.  Maiya House is not wheelchair accessible,  and neither is Aurora House in Vancouver,  which offers the 13 other women-only beds  in the province. A lack of provincial funding  prevents the remodelhng of these houses.  About one-third of the chents at Maiya  House and one-quarter of the chents at Aurora House are Native women, and Susan  Strega feels there is a need for some culturaUy specific treatment of their dependency. "I think Native women are sometimes hesitant to be part of a mixed, non-  Native group, because there's a lack of  understanding of [their experiences]," says  Strega "They experience racism in those  mixed groups which may seem subtle to others, but not to them."  FunctionaUy UUterate women make up  about 20 percent of the Maiya House clientele and Strega says that treatment programs must be made to fit their needs as  weU. "A lot of the avaUable educational information is beyond the capacity of women  who are UUterate. They can't read the information, and if they're watching it on video,  often they can't understand the words."  Adding that they would hke to produce  more information in comic book format and  in bigger letters and smaller words, Strega  says the obstacle for Maiya House is once  again funding.  Strega says that treatment programs are  most accessible for educated, white women.  "That's a terrible thing," she says, "but  that's the truth."  For those women who are able to access  treatment such as at Maiya House, leaving the program can be a time of anxiety.  Leona, a woman from Quesnel, hke many  chents, found it difficult to leave the safety  and understanding within the house. "It  was so safe there to talk about whatever "  needed to," says Leona "But I used the last,  week as preparation time for going home."  Women are strongly encouraged to maintain post-treatment support in order to ease  the transition and to stay in recovery. Many  continue to see outpatient ADP counsellors, attend AA meetings and other support  groups. Maiya House also hosts four "Relapse Prevention" weekends a year where  women can come back and talk about their  areas of concern. CUents often stay in contact with each other and with the Maiya  House staff.  Although the lease on Maiya House is  nearing expiry, Strega is cautiously optimistic the change in the provincial government may bring positive news for the program. "I'm hopeful the NDP wUl take a different view of drug and alcohol services in  general. I also hope that from their general  commitment to gender equahty, they wiU  take a different point of view of the inequity  in residential treatment beds."

Jn North America, the debate about "reproductive choice"  among mainstream feminists often focuses on abortion rights or,  recently, on the legal, ethical and political challenges of reproductive technologies. The fact that contraception—safe, reliable and  voluntary contraception—remains a pressing daily issue for millions of women throughout the world often gets lost in the debates.  Yet contraceptive politics are pivotal to reproductive choice,  and the forces that control contraceptive options—governments,  drug companies and "family planning" organizations—rarely have  women's interests at heart. In May, 1991 Kinesis examined RU  486 (the "abortion pill")—the newest option for women when contraception fails or is unavailable. Here we examine Norplant, described as the first major development in contraception since the  1950's. Norplant is legal in 17 countries around the world and is  presently "under the skin" of hundreds of thousands of women.  by Lois Leveen  In December 1990, the United States Food and Drug Administration  approved Norplant, a new contraceptive method (see box). Since then,  debates over the values and risks of Norplant have raged among femi  nists and health care providers. Although the makers of Norplant have  not yet appUed for permission to do pre-approval testing in Canada, the  recent avaUabUity of Norplant in the US and in US-funded famUy planning programs is already concerning feminists here.  Controversy surrounds any new birth control method. Problems resulting from such unsafe products as the Dalkon Shield and DES have  made women understandably wary of anything touted as a breakthrough. Heterosexual partners remain unsatisfied with available birth  control methods because they are inconvenient, ineffective or unhealthy.  Manufacturers, fearing the sort of law suits that foUowed the Dalkon  Shield, have Uttle impetus to develop new methods. Strict federal regulations and pressure from the growing anti-choice movements in Canada  and the US have also adversely affected pharmaceutical companies' efforts to develop improved contraceptives.  For feminists, the argument about the level of drug regulation in  Canada and the US can be double-edged. Many women understandably  want more information and study than the Department of Health and  Welfare and the American FDA require before approving products hke  Norplant. On the flip side, the US-based Population Council, the nonprofit organization that developed Norplant, has been justifiably criticized for doing so much of their research and trials on Third World  women. Virtually every other method currently being developed is being created and tested in Third World countries. Because these coun-  Norplant is a chemical form of birth control which involves the insertion of capsules  under the skin of a woman's arm.  Norplant capsules prevent pregnancy because they contain levanegestrol, a synthetic  progestin. Progesterone is a hormone produced naturally by women in the second  half of the menstrual cycle. The presence  of synthetic progestin throughout the cycle  (as in PiU or Norplant users) prevents pregnancy in three ways: it blocks the body's  hormonal stimulation for maturation and  release of the eggs; it thickens the cervical  mucus so that sperm are less able to reach  the egg; and it makes the uterine hning inhospitable to the implantation of fertilized  eggs.  A Norplant unit consists of six flexible  silicone capsules. Each capsule is 34 mm  long and contains 36 mg of levanegestrol.  The levanegestrol is continuously diffused  through the waU of the capsules into the  bloodstream. Although the amount of synthetic progestin in the bloodstream of Norplant users decreases over time, the average  level is lower than it is with PiU users.  The capsules are inserted on the inside  of a woman's upper arm,.approximately 9  cm above the elbow crease. This site allows a woman's body to protect the unit  from bumping or jostling. A doctor or clinician makes only one smaU incision, through  which the capsules are inserted in a "fan"  pattern. The capsules rest just below the  skin. The procedure requires a local anesthetic and is performed in an office or chnic  setting.  The Norplant unit is visible only in thin  women, although the capsules can be felt  through the skin. As with any procedure,  the amount of scar tissue and the rate at  which the tissue heals varies from patient  to patient.  The capsules are removed in a similar setting. The removal procedure usuaUy takes  longer, because of the presence of scar tissue  around the unit. Once the unit is removed,  a woman may become pregnant right away,  have a new Norplant set inserted, or switch  to another method of contraception.  tries lack the heavy regulation and stringent monitoring of Canada or  the US, multinational corporations are able to subject their populations  to the earliest wave of drug trials.  This pattern is repeated within Canada and the US where study participants tend to be poor women and/or women of colour—not upper  middle-class, coUege-educated, white women. It is important for white  feminists to remember that the avaUabUity of weU-tested pharmaceuticals is a privUege that can only come at the expense of individuals wUling to risk their own health in a study setting.  An additional criticism is that most of the birth control products currently being developed saddle women with complete contraceptive responsibihty. Men face no risks, no bothersome side effects, and no concern at aU with these methods. Societal conventions about men's re-  sponsibUities for sex and pregnancy are only a partial cause of this  imbalance. In fact, most of the "new" methods are hormone-based—  basicaUy modifications of the PiU. In some cases the drug itself differs,  but often the only thing new is the means of getting the hormone into  the blood stream (researchers hope that implants, shots, and vaginal  "rings" wUl be more direct and less prone to "user faUure" than oral  contraceptives). In other words, there has been no shifting of responsibihty to men because there has been no fundamental re-thinking of  whose fertility should be controUed.  Norplant Safety: Pros & Cons  There are some specific concerns about Norplant's medical safety. For  three decades, opponents of the birth control pUl have mistrusted its  chemical base (chemical methods are more hkely to have high risk side  effects than barrier methods hke diaphragms or condoms). On the other  hand, proponents of the PiU cite the lower rates of cervical cancer and  other diseases among pUl users and insist that the use of synthesized  hormones provides a way to beneficiaUy regulate the level of hormones i  that are present in the female body anyway.  Because Norplant contains only levenorgestrel, a progestin, it could  be an option for women who cannot take combination birth control pills,  which contain estrogen. In addition, Norplant continuaUy releases smaU  amounts of hormones and wUl eUminate the hormonal "surges" caused  by the PiU. However, Norplant has the same contradictions and simUar  side effects as the PUl and does not offer a new option for women who  have chosen not to use the PiU for health reasons.  According to preliminary studies, users of Norplant have not had any  aUergic reactions to the capsules themselves. Implantation and removal  procedures are considered simple enough that the only major risk is  that the setting for the procedures might not be completely sterUe.  Health Action International's Group on Women and Pharmaceuticals has expressed concern that Norplant units have "migrated" to other  parts of the body or been lost altogether during Third World trials.  Wyeth-Ayerst, the company distributing Norplant in the US specificaUy  states that the capsules "should not migrate ... and cannot break"  after implantation. Without more evidence to support either of these  claims, it is impossible to determine whether migration or disintegration  presents a serious risk to Norplant users.  Norplant does have potential side effects, and women wUl need to be  weU-informed of these. For example, if they are not aware that nausea  and depression are possible results of Norplant, women may inadvertantly comphcate the problem by taking other medications. Irregular  bleeding—prolonged periods or spotting—is a fairly common side effect  and women should be counselled to consider in advance how they wUl  feel and how they may be affected, religiously and culturaUy, by abnormal bleeding patterns.  While Norplant is considered a relatively effortless contraceptive  method—after insertion, a woman has nothing to do except have the  capsules removed after five years—that ease can lead to problems.  Those problems are not intrinsic to Norplant as a method, but to the  health care systems that offer the Norplant option. For example, there  wUl be no reliable way to track Norplant recipients and women wUl be  solely responsible for having the implants removed after five years, when  the lowered amount of hormone in the units leads to a risk of ectopic  pregnancy. As weU, there is no way to ensure that a woman who can afford or who receives government funding for a Norplant implantation  wiU have access to the money for the removal procedure five years later.  Norplant also lacks the benefits of a barrier method of birth control,  and women with implants are more Ukely to be exposed to ADDS and  other sexually-transmitted diseases. In addition, women who do not  need to make contraceptive or pregnancy-related visits to a doctor are  less likely to schedule annual gynecological exams, including pap smears.  Because of these potential health risks, health care providers of Norplant must empower women to make weU-informed decisions about their  sexual practices and medical care.  Opportunities for Abuse  On January 4th, 1991, less than a month after the FDA approved  Norplant, Tulare County Superior Court Judge Howard Broadman  in Visalia, California ordered a pregnant mother of four to have Norplant implanted, because she had been convicted of child abuse. In another case, the Kansas State legislature this spring considered a bill that  would pay $500 to female welfare recipients who agree to have the implant, with a $50 annual bonus to be paid each year they kept Norplant  in. Several other states have debated giving imprisoned women parole  incentives and giving social service recipients monetary incentives in exchange for Norplant use.  Although none of these measures have gone into effect, it is obvious  that the avaUabUity of Norplant adds another means through which the  state can determine women's reproductive activity. It is difficult to control any technology once it has been created, and feminists wiU need to  continuaUy monitor any proposal or decision that relates to forced or  encouraged implantation of Norplant.  The state, employers and the conservative movement have already  made huge inroads into controlling female fertility. The idea of forced  vasectomies for fathers who are neghgent in cluld support seems ludicrous because male reproduction is not considered a state issue. Yet regulations concerning women's access to contraception, sterilization and  abortion are already common. Unfortunately, the same high effectiveness and ease of use that makes Norplant an appealing contraceptive  also makes it easy to use coercively.  In California, the Office of FamUy Planning, which provides major financial support to women's chnics throughout the state, has already  committed itself to funding Norplant. This move has enraged some clinic  administrators, who have laced funding denials from OFP for other services they consider vital, such as chlamydia testing. Why has OFP chosen to fund a new and controversial contraceptive whUe they continue to  refuse funding for testing of the most common sexuaUy transmitted disease? The apparent answer is that they are more interested in keeping  poor women from reproducing than they are in keeping them healthy.  But, argues Ev Simon, a pregnancy and HTV counsellor at the  Women's Needs Centre in San Francisco, aU OFP money Comes with  those strings attached. "We routinely take OFP funding because it is  the only way we can provide our chents with the services they need. We  cannot condescend to women by limiting their contraceptive options and  stiU caU ourselves a pro-choice clinic."  Norplant is powerful because it provides a 99.21 percent certain temporary sterilization. Permanent sterUization is currently the most common contraceptive in the US, chosen by 38 percent of those who use  contraception. In Canada, where the rate of contraceptive sterilization  is even higher, nearly one out of every four sterilized individuals later  seeks to have the procedure reversed. Women who feel frustrated by  contraceptive faUure and traditionally consider early sterilization wiU  have another option with Norplant.  Sterilization has been abused for years in so-called famUy planning programs in the Third World, and among Black, Aboriginal and  Latino/a communities in North America. Much of the criticism of Norplant concerns the potential for its widespread abuse in such programs.  The Population Council's stated goal is to develop new contraceptive  technology for Third World nations. Opponents to this use of Norplant  argue that the potential problems—including the lack of staff supervision, the difficulty in maintaining sterile implantation and removal sites,  and the mobUity of many of the women these programs target—far outweigh any benefit that Norplant may have. And some of these problems,  such as the potential for coercion or misinformation, have long been elements of US-financed famUy planning programs in the Third World.

The evenings have two parts:  "Open Discourse," a panel discussion  on a topic relevant to women artists;  and "Salons and Beyond," a loosely  structured get together with beer, coffee  myself to my father," said Shani Mootoo.  Yet it was not so much any particular  statement by these artists that seemed significant as the remarkable, unspoken assumption of the evening. This assumption  was not simply that women could gather together as a support system or that we could  listen to common struggles and encourage  each other as working artists. Rather, the  assumption was that a group of women  Isn't this determination to...make visible one's  experience the origin of the women's  movement?  and a chance to talk to other women  with the same passions.  "Style and Form"—the first of this  series—was held in October. Teri Snelgrove,  artistic director of Tamahnous Theatre, began with remarks about discourse and salons. Salon means hving room and since  eighteenth century France, women have  sponsored and set the tone of salons. Salons are noted for the exchange of ideas-  gossip is important but secondary, Snelgrove quipped. Gertrude Stein's salons were  formative in the development of modern  art. Snelgrove's hope for the evening was  that one person would inspire another, hke  improvisational jazz. Let's talk about the  things we care about with an attitude of  hstening—and change the world, she urged.  WeU, I thought, I hke to talk and sometimes to hsten. Ideas inspire action and I  certainly want to change the world. So I  hstened to the panel of five women with  over a hundred years experience in making art: Kate Weiss (programming director for 1992 Women in VIEW Festival); Susan Frykberg (composer/creator of electro-  acoustic music); Barbara Bourget (artistic  director of Kokoro Dance); Brenda Leadlay  (director and movement teacher at Carousel  ^Theatre); and Shani Mootoo (visual artist  iand author of This is Our Little Secret.  The panehsts addressed "Style and  Form" and asked "What is art?" They answered:  Art is personal empowerment.  Art is hke chUdbirth which creates hope  through blood, pain and struggle.  Art is ecstasy and heartbreak.  Art chaUenges and contributes.  Art forges an identity from fragments.  Art is insight into the human condition.  Art is communion.  Art is responsible to the community it  serves.  And they spoke with passion and inteUi-  gence.  "If we can't break the sUence—expressing  ourselves with impact through art—then  people wiU express themselves with impact  through violence," said Kate Weiss.  They were open and personal.  "I was told I could not be a baUerina because I don't have black hair and aU baUeri-  nas have black hair," said Barbara Bourget.  They spoke with humorous honesty.  "AU I need to do to assure a total constriction of creativity is to start comparing  might draw on their experience of artistic  work and define art. The power to define  has not been ours before and here it was neither claimed nor proclaimed. In this evening  of open discourse, that power was simply assumed.  Now that's progress, I said to myself.  This would not have happened 20 years  ago. Then women did not assume the right,  the power or experience to define art—  especially to each other, with no male authorities to legitimize our statements.  This is progress. We've accomplished  something. This excites me. Yet, in seeing  what we've created, I see more clearly what  we stUl must do.  During the discussion that foUowed the  presentations, Kate Weiss painted RESPONSIBILITY in large white letters on  the black backdrop. Responsibihty for  what? By whom, to whom?  Shani Mootoo addressed these questions  by writing her presentation as a dialogue  with herself: "... questioning myself, moments before I begin to paint." Her token  position as the only woman of colour on  the panel was both highlighted and counteracted by her decision to have Sherry Jamal read the dialogue with her. Sherry Jamal is an architect/artist/writer published  in Harbour and South Asian Review.  Mootoo's dialogue asked: "What about  sexism, racism, elitism, marginalization,  professionalism, co-optation, risk-taking,  proving oneself and forming personal/cultural/national identity?  And also asked: "Do you have to get so  pohtical?  "I am looking forward to the day when a  person is not quahfied by class, colour, sex,  sexual orientation, age or creed, when we're  human beings each one valued as highly as  the other. Then I'U cool it on the pohtics."  The audience responded with attention  and applause to Mootoo's dialogue. But in  discussion, only Zool Suleman, founder of  Rungh magazine, took up the issues she  raised. He gave examples of racist stereotyping in Canadian art today and shared  an experience of protest. Susan Frykberg responded by speaking of her efforts to include  the traditions and expressions of other cultures in her work "Machine Woman." Then  the topic changed. I sensed the kind of timid  or non-response that is often given to someone breaking a sUence that causes others  discomfort.  Whether we are cultural workers or consumers of culture it is time we not only hs  ten but actually take up the issues raised.  Women of courage claim that white women  cannot revolutionize or redefine art by their  inclusion if it ignores or accepts the exclusion of people of colour.  In her conclusion, Mootoo said:  "I am Canadian! I don't have to conform to oppressive ideas that dictate what  art is, or should look hke. Foreign ideas, foreign to me, imposed on my people through  conquering, colonizing, displacing, and destroying our cultures. Alright! Enough of  denying my experiences, my past, my traditions. I am going to use images, materials, methods of working that I know, not  just from my chUdhood, but from my pasts,  pasts that I do not even consciously know,  except through gut feehngs and reactions to  constraint. I am going to unearth, invent if  I have to, a visual vocabulary, and insist on  having a dialogue that recognizes my differences as, not outside, but an integral part  of Canadian mainstream culture."  Isn't this determination to validate and  make visible one's experience the origin of  the women's movement?  Those with the power to define speak in  a language that excludes the experience of  those without the power to define. They do  so by assuming the universahty of their own  limited vision, concerns, issues and agendas.  Mootoo and Jamal referred to this language  as Artspeak, the language of the establishment, grant applications and abstract ideas.  The visions, issues and concerns that  arise from the concrete reaUty of women of  colour working in the arts need to be on the  agenda for aU feminists or we wUl faU to create the hberation and freedom of expression  we say we want, and settle only for success  at learning Artspeak. White and middle-  class women are the most vulnerable to the  delusion that our own inclusion in the art  world is enough. It is not. If we define art  as that which empowers the disempowered,  which creates truth and destroys violence,  which unites an individual with aU that is  alive, then we are responsible for making it  "Open Discourse" plus "Salons and  Beyond" continues for two more months.

Talk 16 foUows the hves of five 15 and  16-year-old girls over a period of a year. It's  extremely funny, stylish and honest. I attended the film with my 15-year-old friend  Erin Bowe, and we both enjoyed watching  and talking about Talk 16 afterwards.

Her companions are her mother and her mother's  friends. A few feet away lies the supine  body of a lone male, basking in the sun,  oblivious to the little girl's stare.  The girl walks over to him, spade in  hand, her eyes fixed with a determination common to young children. Slowly  and deliberately she approaches him.  Suddenly she is there, eyes riveted to  the bulge between his legs, spade poised  in the air, ready to dig where the bulge  conspicuously protrudes. On the verge  of taking that final plunge into discovery, she is startled by his yell, "Hey  whad'you think you're doing?"  Lori Spring's Beach Story tells of  that frustrated desire to know the other  gender—a gender separated by evident  physical difference, and also by gender relations which have been compounded by  women's complicity with patriarchy. The  story begins with a scene of grown-up Alex  at the beach with her mother. Her flashbacks into this chUdhood memory form the  substance of the film's 15-minute journey.  In Alex's past hes the grounding of her mistrust of men and her sense of the potential  violence they embody.  Little girl surrounded by women  seemingly laughing at her. Her eye level  gaze focuses on the area between their  legs—they are all the same. She is humiliated by their mockery. She pees.  Angry strokes, cutting the water's  edge. A young woman now, Alex still  cannot shed the ringing sound of their  laughter. Her gaze follows back to the  beach, where she sees her mother engaged in animated conversation with  a lone male who has strolled over to  her in search of a cigarette and some  conversation. Another man. Confusion,  frustration and self-defeat surround her  as she emerges from the water and sits  at the edge, away from her mother and  the man. A vision of violence rips in  front of her eyes. He is choking her  mother. Swiftly she turns around, but is  confronted with a picture of normalcy.  Her mother is laughing with the man.  Beach Story capsuhzes the contradictory emotions forming the bedrock of gender relations, relations buUt on patriarchal authority and compounded by layers  of subjugation, complicity and domination.  It is an intricately woven tale of emotions  sparked by the desire to know differences  and to put them in place. But human relations are scarcely the kind that can be packaged in neat boxes and filed away for future  references.  The tension Beach Story evokes reminded me of a statement by an articulate young woman in the documentary After The Montreal Massacre: namely, that  we are taught to fulfil roles and expectations  which are contradictory. On the one hand,  we are socialized into a passive acceptance  of our fates, waiting for Prince Charming to  capture our hearts and lead us into a haven  of security. On the other hand, we are besieged with daily acts of violence—violence  directed at us solely on the basis of our gender. And in the aftermath of that violence,  or threat of violence, we are once again told  to turn to those who belong to the same  gender as those who violated us.  In the quagmire of these contradictions,  where can we hope to find any sense? Director Lori Spring leaves us without an answer. In part, the answer can be decoded  from the relations that are presented to us.  The young girl-now-turned-woman, looks to  her mother in askance and is reassured with  a smUe. A sense of resolution through solidarity permeates this final scene.  Beach Story is a complicated tale. The  richness of emotions it communicates in 15  minutes comes close to the style and sophistication characteristic of renowned filmmakers. Spring's work is refreshing. She captures the innocence of femaleness with a  clarity that stays in the mind of the viewer  long after the film has ended. Spring's other  works include Street Passages: A Modern  Romance and the award-winning drama,  Inside/Out.

Kaija: Was Talk 16 a hard idea  to sell? How did you interest the financiers in it?  Janis Lundman: It actually turned out  not to be that hard an idea to seU. We told  people we wanted to do a film on a year  in the hfe of five 15-year-old girls and people were very supportive about that idea.  When we got down to the nuts and bolts  and how much money and aU that kind of  stuff, it started getting a httle more complicated. But people generaUy loved the idea,  which was surprising because there was no  guarantee that we would find the right girls  or that the film would turn out the way it  did.  Adrienne: I don't think there's a lot  out there on teenage girls. There's a lot  of dramatic "boys coining of age" films,  and for example [the documentary film]  28 Up dealt a lot with the male experience, but the female experience in that film  wasn't very strong, wasn't explored three-  dimensionaUy. The idea of foUowing five  people about for a year appeals because  things do happen and that age group, especially for young women, is a very turbulent time. We did a Uttle bit of research and  found that it was between 15 and 16 that  you begin to experiment a lot more with  your sexuahty, with maybe drugs or alcohol. In fact, a lot of them had already experimented at age 12 so we were a bit late  at some levels.  Kaija: The girls told us a lot of very  intimate details. Do you think making  the film was good for them?  Janis: I think it was very good for  them because we found that age group—  not only girls, but boys too—are very isolated. They think that they're the only ones  going through their particular set of problems, they have very few people they can  talk to. They can't talk to their parents, or  they don't think they can; guidance counseUors and teachers are aU too wilhng to  give advice; friends are often very judgmental. We ended up not only hstening but  also questioning them—why are you doing  this, or why aren't you doing that? So they  spend the whole year having people question them constantly on their behefs, their  values and their attitudes and it made them  a lot more aware of who they were. One of  the girls, Astra—the girl who had run away  from home a number of times— [doing Talk  16} was pretty weU the first commitment  that she kept.  Kaija: Were you ever tempted to give  advice ?  Adrienne: It was really hard, especiaUy  with some of the girls, because you did  want to give advice but no, we knew we  couldn't. We tried to phrase our questions  in a way that would make them think without it looking hke we were being judgmental  and I think we managed to do that. They  sorted out some of the problems for themselves by being subjected to this constant  process of examining themselves. We were  just there as a vehicle to maybe trigger some  self-exploration.  Kaija: Because of the personal nature  of what the girls revealed, did you ever  feel you were exploiting them?

Kaija: Despite some extreme differences among us, I liked all the girls.  Why do you think that was?  Adrienne: I think part of that is they  Talk 16 actors Astra, Rhonda, Helen, Lina and Erin  were honest, they were being themselves.  We decided to film it over a whole year  so you get a chance to know these girls.  One of the purposes of the film, too, was  to break past first impressions. We tried  to give you a chance to get to know these  five women so you can try and understand  what they're going through, how they make  their decisions and the struggles that they  go through.  Kaija: You used something you call  "live portraits" in the film. These were  charming and obviously very useful in  giving pictures for a voice over. How did  they come about?  Adrienne: We had come up with a number of ideas before we started shooting that  we wanted to try, and rather than having  a stiU photo we wanted to have a moving  photo of the famUy, so we asked them to  look into the camera and just sit there. They  sat there for more than what you saw, a  minute or a minute and a half!  Janis: And it is very revealing because  you see more in that kind of a situation:  what they do in their movements, if they  do want to keep stiU—and some of them  couldn't keep stiU! You can see a dynamic  between the group, too, which worked reaUy nicely.  Kaija: Talk 16 is a very warm, intimate film. How big was the crew?  Adrienne: We had a smaU crew: a female cinematographer, a female camera assistant, and a sound recordist who was male  but we just considered him one of the girls  after a whUe! For some of the larger shoots  we would also have a production assistant.  Janis: We thought it would be better for  the girls to be able to talk to us with a female cinematographer. Towards the end we  had to bring in a male cinematographer two  or three times when [cinematographer] Deborah Parks couldn't make it, but by that  time they were so used to the process it  didn't matter.  Kaija: How did you share directing?  Adrienne: We would discuss what we  wanted to capture and we would have a  D.D. each day—a Designated Director—so  one person would direct one day, and the  other person would direct the next so there  would only be one of us at a given time talking to the cinematographer.  Janis: We have our own company and  are in the position of producers and con  trol the paycheck. This is one of the reasons  why we had an aU-woman crew. Deborah  Parks had never been hired at that level,  to shoot 50 hours of film as the main cinematographer. Same thing with the assistant  camera. We tried very hard to get a female  sound recordist—they don't exist—at least  not in Toronto! Our editor and production  manager are female. So we are in a sense  mentoring—we're giving women an opportunity to work on a larger scale than they're  used to.

Hull  Sitting in the audience at the Cinematheque, I play a little game with myself. I  scan the room jam-packed with ponytails  and mismatched earrings and lots and lots  of black tights and leather jackets, and I try  to guess which person is Yvonne Rainer—  the feminist, avant-garde, post-mod, independent, not to mention highly successful  American filmmaker—the woman we have  all gathered to hear (and see) introduce her  latest film, Privilege.  But when Rainer strides to the podium,  the woman who stands before us presents  a kind of anti-image in her unstudied understatement. She is not small, but simply  appears that way. She wears beige, I think.  Sensible shoes. She holds her elbows tight  at her sides, alternately crossing her arms  in front of her or stuffing her hands in her  pockets.  When Yvonne Rainer speaks she seems  to lift into a presence, the words animating  her, the words clearly the most important  thing. If her image is no-nonsense, so are her  words—only they are more powerful. And  if Privilege is about challenging the roles,  the images and the representations of our  identitities as constructed by otherr, Rainer  both rejects and typifies these politics. She  is the invisible but vocal social observer.  In this film about race and menopause, she  attempts and often succeeds in converting  the invisibility of people of colour and postmenopausal women into a heard voice.  In many ways, Privilege defies direct description. I find myself thinking in  metaphors. I think about how I leave the  average film: duly sated, I stuff it in some  corner of my memory Uke a chestnut in my  pocket, not to be found or thought of again  until spring dry cleaning rolls around. Try  [Rainer] is the  invisible but vocal  social observer  this with Privilege and the chestnuts multiply, spilling out of your mind's pockets in  swells. Whatever you may think of it (and  I think it's amazing, brilliant and flawed),  this film will not leave you alone. It implicates me—especially me, white woman,  white feminist, privileged white—in ways I  had thought about, but not genuinely felt.  When asked what audience she had in  mind, Rainer responds without hesitation:  "My audiences are primarily white—have  always been and probably always will be."  She plans, however, to take this film to  Black audiences, to hear their reactions.  Later, she adds that Privilege is not an exhaustive treatment of menopause or racial  issues, but more a challenge to younger  women and men who don't want to know.  (Okay, okay, but tell us about the film,  fer chrissakes.)  Privilege begins with a few pithy truisms on women's experience of aging. In a  clip from Between Friends, Carol Burnett  laughs, "I finally get my head together and  my ass falls apart. I'd hke to will menopause  away." The character Jenny claims, "When  you're young they whistle at you, when  you're middle-aged they treat you Uke a  bunch of symptoms and when you're old  they ignore you;" and one real-life interviewee claims that, "Keeping your dignity  as you enter menopause is Uke fighting city  hall."  In between the testimonials of these  women, Rainer offers a few choice cUps from  a 70's educational film on menopause. The  footage looks and sounds Uke something  from the 50's, with mostly male doctors  (sponsored by drug companies peddling estrogen replacement therapy) offering helpful information: "...even though the role  Jenny then confesses to Yvonne a story  she has never told anybody. In defense of  her white friend, Brenda, who narrowly escaped being raped by Carlos, a Puerto Rican man, Jenny perjured herself on the  stand, falsely claiming that she saw Carlos  in Brenda's apartment. Carlos goes to jail,  Jenny got it on with the upper crusty attorney who tries the case. But the crux of this  story is dramatized in scenes where Brenda  argues to Carlos that Freud's idea of the  dark continent of woman and her blood is  connected to the imperiaUst notion of the  The  most  reriM  B^ thing  was  the   silence |  SMkated   from  friends    am  jfllregar&ng  (mm  the    detail  - oi  * «y     single  middleage. >  %is younger,  my sex YdSi  een the object  of   all   m  d*   of  questioning,  I from     prqp  ^ solicitous^!  iCfn^V^  curiamity     to  pm crr<  No% that   I  kdid not fif  eat to  be Ji>o%ng for  la man,  flte  ItfMgtf-desires  Ifeemedofn?

(Oh thank  you, doctor, thank you.)  Rainer also offers inter-texts shot off a  computer. There are some horrifying statistics cut with gallows humour: by age 50,  31 percent of aU women in the US have  had hysterectomies. The hysterectomy is  the most commonly performed surgery in  the US. And then there's a saying among  doctors that "No ovary is so healthy it is not  better removed, and no testes so diseased it  is not better left intact."  But at the heart of the film exists a  real story—several stories, in fact—drawn  directly from Rainer's own experience.  "Yvonne" Washington (played by African  American actor NoveUa Nelson) has decided to make a documentary film about  her change of Ufe. She wants to interview  an old friend Jenny (played by white actor AUce Spivak) about her experiences  with menopause. Jenny demurs, preferring  to tell about the times when "they whistled" at her. In a series of complex maneuvers between past and present, race and  menopause stories, Yvonne and Jenny strike  a deal.  Jenny tells a "hot flashback" of a time  when, as a young, attractive woman, she  failed to see those in the shadow of  privUege—the people of colour and ethnic  minorities Uving in her own neighbourhood.  Jenny's hot flash becomes a metaphor for  social outrage: "Having passed the frontier  of attractiveness to men, she [too] is on the  other side of privUege." (I wonder, though,  how many people are scratching their heads  and saying, wait a second, losing your position of privUege is not the same as being  born without it. These are not equivalent  experiences.)  Black man as dark continent which Unks  white fear of blackness with the colour of  shit.  Blood and shit. "What an obnoxious  idea," balks Yvonne. "What?" asks Jenny  blankly. "How shit gets connected up with  blackness and badness," says Yvonne," ...  it's capitaUsm pure and simple that has  given us racism ... White women always  manage to use their victim status as a  way of pleading innocent to the charge of  The fact that "Yvonne" is played by an  African American woman who often utters  such truths has been criticized by many  ...you can't forget  who wrote the  script, who framed  and contextualized  the information...  viewers. At the two screenings I attended,  there were a number of people who felt that  Rainer was using the "Yvonne" character's  race to legitimize Rainer's message.  Rainer defends her choice: "I had to begin and end with Black women questioning  white feminism ... there is a whole history  of exclusion of Black women as marginaUzed  and ignored in white feminist writings. We  are aU sisters, but we are not." She hopes  her film reveals the crisis in feminism of the  white middle class woman "speaking for aU  women." At at the same time, you can't  forget who wrote the script, who framed  and contextuaUzed the information, who directed this film.  Rainer points out that she did not write  the dialogue for the people of colour in the  film. Instead she used excerpts from works  by Eldridge Cleaver, Piri Thomas, Franz  Fanon and others to avoid "putting words in  the mouth of or "crowding out" authentic  voices. However, these texts do not read Uke  dialogue. WhUe the menopause story was  broken up with Uve interviews and personal  epigrams, the "race" story had no such leai  ening and my attention ground to a halt  during several of the longer monologues. For  me, the result was that the menopause story  ultimately usurped the race issues.  And I could not, in the end, get away  from the idea that the story of women's  aging was more successful because it was  more Rainer's own story. The story of Carlos and Brenda also stems from Rainer's experience, but as she attempts to draw the  paraUel between a race-based lack of priv-  Uege/visibiUty and an age-based faU from  privUege/visibiUty, the world Rainer cannot  participate in fuUy ends up sputtering into  theory.  WhUe Rainer appears very sensitive to issues concerning the appropriation of Black  voices in this film, I was uncomfortable  with her repeated invocation of the words  of Gloria Anzaldua on the subject of appropriation vs. proliferation. Clearly Rainer  feels she has proliferated (spread) positive  cultural images and not appropriated or  crowded out the voices of people of colour.  StUl, I heard her use these words so many  times, I felt she was using them too much  for her own benefit.  Rainer is, however, in top form on issues pertaining to representation and film  narrative. In Privilege the film becomes  a witness to itself, self-consciously enacting its own theoretical issues. Rainer tells  us what she's doing at every step of the  way, deUberately exposing, in virtuaUy every scene, the guts of filmmaking and especiaUy the terrific power wielded by the  film director. She is the only filmmaker I  have ever heard describe the cinema as "especiaUy seductive and sinister." Pointing to  critic Pauline Kael's comment that "only in  the movies can you send your mind away,"  Rainer clearly requires that the viewer not  send her mind away.  Narrative realism is dismantled at every turn—here we see the gaffer, there we  see the director before the camera, later  we watch the actors out of character at  the film's wrap party. Rainer disrupts our  assumptions time after time. These techniques, combined with the coUage effect of  the entire film, wiUfuUy expose the wizard  behind the spectacle. In her own words,  Rainer wants to "restore the critical capacity to the spectator who has been carried  away by cinematic Ulusion." TaU order, but  she succeeds brilUantly.  Privilege begins with Rainer herself  playing Helen Caldicott, the AustraUan activist. She stares blankly at the camera  declaring, in Caldicott's own words, "We  are pathetic. We haven't got any guts ...  And I'm one of you. I haven't got any  guts either." Yet I can't help but beUeve  that with this film Rainer has taken up  Caldicott's chaUenge. She does not always  succeed, particularly on issues pertaining to  representations of racial identity. But the  fact is she puts herself out there (personaUy and inteUectuaUy) on issues white feminists have swept under the carpet—that's  already more guts than many of us have.  Jillan Hull thinks being a critic is a  lot easier than being a filmmaker.  KINESIS sssssssssssssss*^  Arts  The eco-debate:  Humanism or feminism?  FINDING OUR WAY:  Rethinking Ecofeminism  by Janet Biehl  Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1991  by Sarah Hutcheson  In Finding Our Way: Rethinking  Ecofeminist Politics Janet Biehl provides  us with a rich exploration of the ideas faUing  under the banner of ecofeminism. She argues the need for serious debate within both  the ecology and feminist movements given  their faUure to address questions raised by  ecofeminism.  At its root, ecofeminism is a movement to  unite feminist and environmental concerns.  Biehl contends that whUe ecofeminist writings are diverse, there are some centralizing themes in the Uterature. First, there is  FINDING  OUR  WAY  a general acceptance that throughout the  history of western thought, women and nature have been frequently associated with  one another and counterposed to culture.  Second, women have innate and superior capacities for caring and nurturing. FinaUy, by  virtue of their sex, women are uniquely able  to recognize and value the interconnected-  ness of aU Ufe forms, both human and non-  human.  Biehl argues that ecofeminism has not  Uved up to its promise nor potential for creating a space within which feminism and  ecology can jointly challenge both sexism  and environmental degradation. She contends that, instead, ecofeminism has "...  become a force for irrationaUsm, most obviously in its embrace of goddess worship, its  glorification of the early NeoUthic, and its  emphasis on metaphor and myths."  In laying the groundwork for her discussion, Biehl acknowledges she is in agreement with ecofeminists on several points.  The most central of these is that women's  oppression in most cultures has not been a  function of biology but of male-created hierarchies. Of equal importance is the notion  that western culture does not appreciate its  real dependence on the biosphere and, as a  result, is continually degrading the environment.  Biehl outUnes and critiques some of the  dominant themes of the ecofeminist Uterature. Many ecofeminists paint "woman-nature" metaphors, pointing out that both  have been defined as "other" throughout  western thought and have been simUarly oppressed. Biehl states that the acceptance of  the male-derived image of "woman-nature"  has meant ecofeminists have, by definition, placed women outside western culture which, whUe misogynistic, constitutes a  wealth of ideas and knowledge not to be casually dismissed. Ecofeminism casts women  in a reductionist Ught, revealing them as  "essentiaUy" other to western culture.  Biehl takes ecofeminists to task for the  notion that women are innately more caring and thus inherently equipped for the  task of mothering the earth back to health.  She suggests that arguments about women's  essential nature serve, to reinforce male-  created images of women as being ruled by  their biology. One of the lessons of feminist projects thus far has been that any attempt to define women as essentiaUy anything generaUy works against us. If we are  nurturing in nature then we "naturaUy" belong in the home doing just that. Essen-  tiaUst arguments have traditionally acted  as barriers to women's participation in the  pubUc realm. Biehl further argues that by  emphasizing caring and nurturing, ecofeminists have reduced women's potentiaUties,  ignoring our capacities for consciousness,  reason and freedom.  Another thread of ecofeminism Biehl critiques is the call for goddess worship. The  assertion that the worship of a goddess  wUl change the material reality of women's  Uves today ignores the institutionaUzation  of women's oppression. Biehl questions the  value of this notion on the grounds that it is  misleading at best and dangerous at worst.  She is also critical of women such as  Starhawk who beUeve we wUl recognize our  calUng to preserve the earth once we understand not only that nature is aUve but  that we are inextricably intertwined with it.  According to Biehl, this method of reasoning "... becomes not only an approach for  viewing our interconnectedness with natural ecosystems and the inorganic world but  a universal panacea for dealing with the  problems created by capitaUsm and social  oppression."  Biehl continues her critique of ecofeminism by chaUenging its rejection of the  "best" legacies of western culture; democracy, reason and scientific understanding.  She states that the most valuable achievements of western culture should not be dismissed because they have been produced  primarUy by men. Instead we must take and  use what we deem to be useful. Thus ratio-  naUty should not be cast aside as valueless  or inherently misogynistic because it is associated with male culture. We must instead  embrace our capacities for rational thought  and thereby expand our range of faculties.  Central to most ecofeminist thought is  the assumption that the oppression of  women constitutes the primary oppression  in society today, a claim which Biehl finds  problematic. While women are objects of  domination they are not necessarUy the sole  primary objects of domination. She argues  that "it is difficult to see how freeing women  from misogyny wUl also free women—or  men—from oppression under capitaUsm and  the nation state, let alone racist societies."  She continues to argue that the Uberation  of women is dependent upon the end of aU  forms of oppression, not only the end of  male domination. All these institutions of  domination are too tightly woven together  to be addressed in isolation from one another.  Biehl views social ecology as the appropriate vehicle for creating positive change.  The central tenet of social ecology is that  the end of the domination of nature is not  possible untU we also successfuUy chaUenge  hierarchy and class structures in human society such as sexism, homophobia, racism,  nation-statism, economic exploitation, capitaUsm and aU other social oppressions. A  genuinely free society is only possible if aU  forms of hierarchy are abolished.  Biehl ends her discussion by stating that  "if women have a 'caUing' it is not the particularistic ... one that ecofeminists assign  them ... it's the chaUenge to rise to a gen-  cisely because we are seeking "answers" to  our environmental "problems" that we must  take a critical look at any theory which professes to provide them.  Finding Our Way: Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics is thought-provoking on  two counts. Not only does Biehl provide us  with a valuable critique of ecofeminism but  she also encourages us to consider the offerings of social ecology. The constant strug-  gUng within feminisms to adequately address oppression in its numerous guises (sex,  ...her critique of ecofeminism [challenges] its  rejection of the "best" legacies of western  culture: democracy, reason and scientific  understanding.  erous ecological humanism, ... to an aU  embracing sense of soUdarity, not only with  nonhuman Ufe but with men who form an  integral part of humanity as a whole. To  heighten specious differences ... is to taint  ecology and the authentic goals of feminism  aUke."  At a time when people have an ever-  heightening concern with the environment,  ecofeminism provides us with an alternative  analysis. Biehl's book is timely as it is pre-  race, class, age, sexual orientation) makes  the exploration of social ecology important  work. Perhaps we must be wary of any theory which focuses on one form of domination to the exclusion of aU others and instead look for ways to address oppression.  as such rather than particular manifestations of it. Biehl's book wUl surely be valuable to anyone attempting to think their  way through the offerings of ecofeminism.

I  would Uke Elaine to clarify some points so  that I may really consider the perspective  she has put forth. What are the issues that  (we) feel about the women's movement and  that are not being discussed in Kinesis?  How do we fix the fact that Kinesis is inherently racist and classist? Who is getting  dumped on? What is the "correct Une" that  must not be interfered with and whose Une  is it?  Elaine continuously uses "us," "our,"  "we;" so I assume she must be referring to  me as weU. I am a Vancouver femimst yet I  don't know what controversy is being censored by Kinesis'!

Martin Dufresne  Montreal Men Against Sexism  Montreal, PQ  How about  giving up power?  Kinesis:  Briefly, power and privUege are problems in the feminist movement. This we  know. White, middle/upper class women often speak for aU women without acknowledging the women of colour and First Nations women that they so often exclude or  push to the margins. Okay, many of us know  this too. So, what's being done about this?  WeU, I know what isn't being done. Instead of me seeing a Black woman performing on stage at the recent Vancouver Status of Women benefit, I saw Nan Gregory  up there misquoting Sojourner Truth and  misrepresenting Langston Hughes. One step  forward, two back. "Life ain't been no crystal stair," that's for sure.  I expect there wUl be more dialogue  among white, privUeged women about the  issue of "giving up power." This is aU I have  to say. The situation should speak for itself.  Janisse Browning  Vancouver, BC  Statement from  In Visible Colours  Kinesis:  [The foUowing statement was issued by  the former board of directors of In Visible  Colours.]  On September 9, 1991, Mr. Justice Preston ruled that in the case between In Visible Colours (IVC) and Women in Focus  (WIF), IVC be awarded 75 percent and  WIF be awarded 25 percent of the profits  generated by the In Visible Colours-International Film and Video Festival and Symposium.  Mr. Justice Preston further affirmed that  WIF was wrong to have seized the funds and  withheld it from IVC, at least as to the 75  percent of it.  It is unfortunate that the case between  IVC and WIF escalated to the heights that  it did. Contrary to the statements of specifi<  individuals acting in the capacity of board  members of WIF, IVC attempted to negotiate a way out of this situation many times  in the period between the initial seizure of  the funds by WD? and the summary trial  held on September 9th.  These attempts at negotiation are documented in rVC records, but were frustrated  by the board members of WIF refusal to  budge from their position stating that aU  the funds generated by In Visible Colours  were in fact "owned" by WIF, and that  In Visible Colours was a "group of women  claiming to represent the festival."  This interim board, led by Sue Jenkins,  was instrumental in pushing this case to  its logical Umit, putting it before a male  court system rather than letting matters  take their own course and aUowing the WIF  membership to decide on a course of action  that was morally and pohticaUy faithful and  just. That course of action was specified and  articulated by the WIF membership at various meetings prior to this summary trial.  Yet, the board did not see fit to foUow the  dictates of the membership and pursued a  course of action that accomplished Uttle for  the organization.  At the outset of the summary trial, Kim  Roberts, the counsel for WIF's board members, went first with his submissions and immediately suggested that WIF was wUling  to settle with a 75/25 split, based on a draft  contract drawn up by WIF employee Deborah Mclnnes during the Festival in 1989.  Both WD? and IVC had stated in their  pleadings that neither party beheved this  to be a vaUd contract. At no time had WIF  ever indicated to IVC that it beheved IVC  was entitled to 75 percent of the profits. H  Kim Roberts truly beheved in his cUent'i  case, he should have taken the opportunity  to push for 100 percent. Yet, he did not.  So what did WIF achieve by pushing this  Utigation so far? Even the 25 percent that  was awarded wUl Ukely be used to pay Kim  Roberts his fees. And why didn't the WD?  board state that they were wUUng to settle for 25 percent at the outset and thereby  avoided the expense that goes into Utigation? At numerous occasions, the IVC board  had stated that it was wUUng to help its sister organization out of the financial quagmire surrounding it. AU that was required  was an acknowledgement that the funds  painstakingly generated by IVC belonged to  In Visible Colours. Needless to say, that acknowledgement never came forth, and the  old Board's acknowledgement was rescinded  by the actions that foUowed when it learned  of WIF's dire financial straits.  Despite aU this, we the old board of  In Visible Colours, would Uke to extend  our thanks and sincere appreciation to the  membership of Women in Focus, who stood  beside us during this turbulent period. We  wish you the best and hope that you do not  have to suffer the outcome of the actions undertaken by the WD? interim board members.
