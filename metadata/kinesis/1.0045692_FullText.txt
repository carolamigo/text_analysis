Palestinian  speakers  The Vancouver Committee to Support  Palestinian Rights will be hosting two Palestinian women who are touring North Amer^'  ica to generate support for and understanding of the Palestinian struggle. The women  were scheduled to be in Vancouver from mid  to late November but as the person making the arrangements with North American  contacts has been detained by Israeli authorities it has been impossible to confirm  dates.  Women who live on the West Bank or  the Gaza Strip are living in an area that  has been occupied by Israel and subject to  military rule for 20 years. They, along with  men, are subject to arrest and imprisonment  for political reasons and under conditions  of extreme ill-treatment including torture.  Women prisoners have conducted two successful strikes for better conditions.  Women are also frequently put under  house arrest. Families regularly have their  houses destroyed if one member of the family is even suspected of illegal political activity. Palestinian women who live in refugee  camps in Lebanon have been shot and killed  while attempting to return to the camps  with food for their families.  The Committee recognizes that there are  many parallels between the experience of  Palestinians and Canada's Native people, a  fact which often escapes Canadian's attention. As only one example, Canada was colonized by England and settled mainly by  European immigrants. Canada was established in total disregard of the wishes of the  Native population. The same is true of the  state of Israel. In both cases the colonizers  portrayed the land as empty and waiting to  be settled; in neither case was this true.  The Committee will be organizing an  evening event when the Palestinian women  arrive. Please watch for notices about this  and come to hear what they have to say  about conditions in their homeland. For  more information call 877-0514.  Housewives  report  It's Time To Speak Out, the second  report of Housewives in Training and Research is now available. The report was developed by seven Vancouver women who  interviewed women in their communities  about their daily lives as housewives and  mothers.  Sections on individual women's stories  are balanced with factual information on  welfare, education, poverty, daycare, immigrant women and more.  The study concludes with recommendations to housewives that urge them to seek  emotional and financial recognition for their  work and to governments calling for pensions and wages for housework. The report also urges the media to play a role by  presenting realistic and positive images of  housewives and their work.  Copies of the report can be obtained  by writing Housewives in Training and Research, c/o South Vancouver Family Place,  7595 Victoria Drive, Vancouver, B.C. V5P  3Z6. A donation of $1.50 to cover postage  costs is requested.  Call for  submissions  Healthsharing, a Canadian feminist  health quarterly, is planning a thematic issue on Women, Health and Economics for  June, 1988.  The issue will address the impact of economic factors on women's social, emotional  and physical lives. It will include personal  and analytical articles, and will look at individual and systems level concerns.  Proposals should indicate whether an article is a personal experience, introduction  to a problem, an analysis of issues or an  interview. Also include the angle, what or  who will be quoted, how long the article will  be and why it will interest Healthsharing  readers. Manuscripts due on Jan. 15th.

The paragraph should have read as follows: "Meister's complaint generated broad  public attention when the Ports Canada  police intelligence unit decided to investigate her background to determine whether  she was planning "any other aggressive actions." Intelligence officer, Larry Kozak,  asked Meister's acquaintances about her  home life, her political affiliations, whether  she had a job and what community groups  she belongs to."  Since the publication of the October issue  Joan Meister has received an apology from  Ports Canada. While pleased that Ports  Canada has acknowledged its responsibility, Meister has suggested that since Ports  Canada has admitted investigating other legitimate protesters they should be required  to destroy any files they have on activists  pressing for disabled access improvements  to Crab Beach.  Corrections  Our November cover image was attributed to an unknown artist. In fact the  image is from a work by well known artist  Fernand Leger (1881-1955) called Nus sur  fond rouge painted in 1923.

Coalition for Abortion  Clinics: building support  by Noreen Howes  Vancouver women marched and rallied on October 18. continuing  the B.C. Coalition of Abortion Clinics (BCCAC) campaign to open  an abortion clinic in Vancouver. The clinic coalition is working to  raise $500,000 for legal defense costs before the clinic opens.  Many British Columbia Social  Credit women disagree with their  leader on one important issue according to Jackie Ainsworth of the  B.C. Coalition of Abortion Clinics  (BCCAC).  "Women Socreds we've talked  to are upset that (Premiere  William) Vander Zalm is trying  5 to impose his personal political  | views on the populace ..." she  § said. "They feel that in a province  *«! where eighty-seven percent of the  8 people support choice on abortion,  § there should be a separation of  "? church and state."  2 Most of these women, Ains-  •c worth added, are pro-choice but  not necessarily pro-clinic. One  woman active in the Social Credit  party however does support plans  to open a free-standing abortion  Trail cleaners lose fight  by Noreen Howes  Attempting to keep their jobs,  fourteen office cleaners at Cominco Industries in Trail, B.C.  took on their bosses—both in the  Steelworker's union and in the  company—and lost.  Early in October, eighteen months after these women were told  their cleaning jobs were being  handed over to janitors (union  brothers anxious to get back  to work), an Industrial Relations Council (IRC) decision ruled  against them.  "There is nothing inherently unlawful in a union making such a  decision that favours one group of  employees over another," the decision reads. "The Panel understands the sense of injustice the  Complainants may feel... but unfairness is not necessarily unfair  representation."  The women filed a Section 7  complaint against local 480 after  they were laid off in March 1986,  charging the union with acting in  bad faith and in a discriminatory  manner. The union had refused  their request to grieve the lay-offs.  "Pretty soon we'll be dinosaurs," said Charleen Davidow, a  cleaner with eight years seniority.  "Extinct in this company ... and  the union sat on their behinds and  didn't lift a finger to get us rehired."  The August IRC hearing which  ruled on the women's jobs was  boycotted by local 480 as part  of an overall B.C. Federation  of Labour strategy. Their action  proved detrimental to the women:  evidence of the union's bad faith  and discrimination was called in-  admissable and hearsay due almost entirely to the union's absence.  Although Section 7's are historically hard to win, Steve Geller,  the women's legal counsel, said the  IRC made a political decision in  supporting the union over the office cleaners.  "It was done to demonstrate to  the Steelworkers and (Ken) Geor-  getti and the B.C. Federation of  Labour that the IRC didn't deserve this harsh boycott treatment."  clinic in Vancouver, and has offered to share her fundraising skill  with BCCAC.  "As a backroom worker for the  Socreds she does fundraising and  she comes up with some great  ideas like gourmet dinners at a  hundred bucks a shot."  BCCAC is unwilling to provide the woman's name at this  time, honoring her request for  anonymity. They also refused to  divulge the names of other supportive members of the Social  Credit party.  Clinic organizers say the only  way to successfully keep a clinic  open is to have a broadly-based  coalition; a membership drive is  therefore a priority within BCCAC with people from all political  parties asked to join.  "B.C. has the highest pro-choice  support   in   the   country,   which  Consider their odds: living and  working in a company town where  both the company and union want  them gone and where hundreds of  RCMP runs amok  by Marianne van Loon  Continuing the fight against pornography, RCMP raided a downtown Calgary office in mid October, and seized 42 slides. The office  belongs to the Alberta Coalition  Against Pornography (ACAP) and  the slides, of magazines and books  sold locally, are part of their anti-  pornography presentation.  Janet LaVoie, coalition spokesperson said, "It's been wonderful  publicity, but it's absurd. They  should be supporting us. If we  have porn on view, its because it's  for sale (around Calgary). That's  where they should be putting their  energy.  The raid followed a complaint  by a man who had seen the anti-  pornography presentation previously. When he found out it was to  be shown again, he contacted the  authorities who duly attended the  show. The RCMP discussed with  ACAP the possibility of making  a presentation to Alberta's Attorney General to determine if the  slides were illegal or would come  under the "public good" classification. However, this was apparently  not the usual protocol, and two  RCMP constables, armed with a  search warrant raid the ACAP offices and made off with the slides.  Subsequently the Attorney General declined to press charges and  the slides were returned, in a  brown paper bag, by a plainclothes  officer.  The company was "in collusion"  with the union, he added, over the  decision to replace the office cleaners with janitors—a "meeting of  the minds" said one Cominco representative at the IRC hearing.  "There's nothing in the collective agreement that prohibits the  employer from transferring work;  therefore the employer has open  season on the union with the  union's acquiescence ... it's a sad  commentary on the union representation of its members, how they  square that duty with how they  get along with the employer."  The fourteen women have lost  in their bid to regain their jobs  but what's not lost to them is  the strength and courage they've  sharpened throughout this fight.  "We've hit a few nerves,"  said Davidow, "that these 'dumb  women' could take it this far."  laid-off men grasp at the chance to  get back on the Cominco payroll.  The women could find no legal help, "All the lawyers in Trail  are either in the company pocket  or the union pocket," and they  sought instead the counsel of a  lay advocate. But legal expenses  still accumulated leaving the office  cleaners with a $2,000 debt.  Further, the women were bar-  raged from the outset with sexism  from their union brothers.  Davidow recalls Local 480 president Bob Schmidt warning her  that the women had made so much  fuss they'd be sure to never work  again and that since they weren't  'breadwinners' in the same way as  men are, they therefore don't deserve the jobs.  "According to the union hot  con't on page 4  means a lot of Socreds out there  want the right to choose," said  Ainsworth, "And of course we  want individuals in the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties represented as well."  NDP support is clear with  leader Mike Harcourt assuring  Medical Services Plan coverage for  the clinic if his party gains power,  and with the NDP Women's  Rights Committee continuing to  take an active role in the coalition.  Outreach work is also being  done through B.C. Federation of  Labour who will mail BCCAC  membership requests to their locals across the province.  "We'll inform local officers of  the clinic campaign, remind them  of our policy supporting freestanding abortion clinics and suggest they tell their members to join  the coalition," said Astrid Davidson of the B.C. Fed.  The fact that clinic support is  rooted in the Vancouver women's  movement, says Ainsworth, makes  outreach to rural women an important part of BCCAC's membership  drive. Support letters for the clinic  have recently gone to every B.C.  women's centre.  Fundraising—both   for   the  clinic's eventual opening and for  legal expenses in the event of it being shut down—are also a high priority of BCCAC.  Although the amount of money  needed to actually open the clinic  is not known, BCCAC estimates a  $500,000 legal defense fund must  first be raised to protect clinic  workers.  According to Ingrid Pacey of  Physicians for Choice doctors  want this financial security before  they will agree to work in a clinic.  "It's a great risk physicians would  be taking," she said. "It's an illegal act and they will be harassed  by government, by the courts, by  anti-choice people on the street  Physicians for Choice is comprised of forty doctors supportive  of choice on abortion but opposed  to free-standing abortion clinics,  and another forty favouring the establishment of a Vancouver clinic.  "Right now there isn't a cohesive group of doctors that support  that position (of opening a freestanding abortion clinic in B.C.),"  said Pacey. "There isn't money for  legal defence or for the clinic."  There are presently no doctors willing to work in a Vancouver clinic. "We feel strongly  that we're not going to find a Morgentaler to work in the clinic and  we don't really want one," said  Ainsworth."We don't want to be  open to the charges of a travelling  abortionist ... we want a team of  B.C. doctors."  Both Ainsworth and Pacey believe it to be a matter of educating  doctors of the advantages, both in  terms of accessibility and medical  attention, to providing the services  of a free-standing abortion clinic.  "We're still miles away from  any real discussion on opening a  clinic," said Ingrid Pacey.  KINESIS ACROSS B.C.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^^  \NXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^^  Legal aid cuts gut family law services  by Jackie Brown  There is a growing speculation  that more B.C. women are having to turn to social assistance because the legal aid system cannot  adequately represent their rights  in family law matters.  Insufficient provincial funding  and strict eligibility requirements  are cited as major problem areas  hich make it difficult for many •  women to either obtain maintenance orders or have them enforced. As a result, some are being  forced into poverty.  Barbara Findlay, Director of  Client Services for the Legal Aid  Services Society, says prior to restraint measures in 1982, a woman  was eligible for legal aid if paying for a private lawyer would  impair her ability to adequately  house, feed and clothe herself  and her family. Now, however,  eligibility is based on Statistics  Canada poverty guidelines, and  only women earning $810 net per  month or less qualify.  "So that means there are many  women who can't afford a lawyer  in a long maintenance or custody  battle and they aren't able to get  any help form us," said Findlay.  Jessica Gossen, of Gossen and  Dunnaway, notes that the "absurdly low" financial levels means  that even a woman in a low paying  clerical job may not qualify for legal services, "despite the fact that  she is below the poverty line."  Even those women who are eligible and get a maintenance order  often have difficulty getting them  enforced. Gossen says one reason is  that family law fees are so low that  lawyers eventually reach a point  where they can no longer afford  to stay on cases dragged out for  months by men who know their  wives will eventually run out of  money to fight.  "Women in society aren't generally made a priority and another  example of it is legal aid funding,"  says Gossen, who adds that the  family law tariff rate is the same  for criminal law—a mostly male  area both in terms of lawyers and  offenders—even though family law  requires four times the work.  Those lawyers who take cases  on a "pay as you go" basis for  women who aren't eligible for legal aid, have an even tougher time  of it, she says. "I have a client in  a low paying clerical job ... and  basically I've funded her lawsuit.  Her husband is a longshoreman  who earns $40,000 a year to her  $10,000. She has an order, and he's  ignored the process. So what happened was, she ran out of money  and I've run out of the ability to  fund the lawsuit."  Findlay says legal aid will provide enforcement assistance only  in those very few instances where  it is clear that the woman cannot proceed on her own. She adds,  however, that family counselling  services will help initiate a "show  cause" hearing—where the husband must tell the court why he  can't pay.  But, she said, it is up to the  woman to convince the judge that  he can—an often difficult process  especially since the husband could  have had plenty of time to prepare his defense. "She can cross  examine, but that is a skill even  some lawyers find difficult to acquire," says Findlay, adding that  such hearings don't have a high  success rate.  When asked if enforcement  problems could be sending more  women to social assistance, Findlay conceded the possibility: "I  can't say, based on the statistics  we have, that it's a fact. But what  is true, is, if Mrs. Smith comes to  us for enforcement of arrears, she  won't get it unless it's urgent."  Gossen says there is no doubt  that strict eligibility requirements  and enforcement difficulties have  increased the number on income  assistance. Lack of reasonable  maintenance along with provincial funding cutbacks to daycare  and homemaker services, makes it  impossible for many women with  children to go to work, she says.  Gossen says the situation is  even more desperate for women  who can't get restraining orders to  prevent their husbands from abducting the children or to protect  themselves against abuse.  "Over and over again, I've met  up with women who have been  forced by the process or by their  own lack of knowledge about (battered wife) services and by the incredible hustle it takes to get legal  aid funding for a lawsuit, into situations where they've been literally  fearing for their lives over a course  of six months."  And, ironically, says Gossen,  many are winding up with abusive  con't from page 3  shots they were just womenfolk  working for pin money," said Steve  Geller. "Schmidt was outraged  that this handful of 'ladies' had the  temerity to fight him ... they were  supposed to roll over and die, not  be fighting two years later."  Bob Schmidt denies exercising  any discrimination. "I have always  pushed women to the forefront,  same as I push men," he said,  citing his daughter, a champion  jockey, as an example.  Steve Geller found the experience of working with the women  awe-inspiring.  "They got told over and over  again 'we are the power so  step aside'," he said, ^>ut these  extraordinary women still have  the feeling in their bones that  when they're treated wrongly—  especially by their union—they  want to make it right."  Bob Schmidt disagrees. "...  the impression I'm left with for  these ladies is that all they care  about is themselves, yes, they're  selfish."  "We're trying to support ourselves and they say we're selfish!"  said Davidow. "When our husbands walked out on us and left us  with kids to support none of them  lifted a finger to help ... it'll be  the men who'll complain about all  the women on welfare! They'll say  'she's just scumming off the guys  who are working'."  According to Geller, the women  have won a great victory by their  courage, stamina and unity: victory for all Local 480 rank and  file members. "It'll be a cold day  in hell that the union will proceed  in such a cavalier manner with  a group of workers in the days  ahead."

To try and make more husbands  pay their court-ordered maintenance, the B.C. Attorney General's office has established the  Family Maintenance Enforcement  project. However, the program is  only for women already on social  assistance, says Findlay, and operates in the Vancouver area only—  although plans for its expansion to  other regions are in the works.  While Gossen says the program  theoretically makes it tougher for  husbands to skip payments because they would be in contempt  of court and go to jail, she says  judges rarely impose the penalty.  "My view is, you have many  older judges, who have grown up  with a different attitude towards  family law and maintenance and  have a different attitude towards  the 'poor man' who is being taken  to court. It's 'why doesn't she just  go out and support herself and  why doesn't she just go away."  Gossen says while the courts might  be publicly saying they are going  to get tough, "it's not the case."

The Vancouver School  Board's (VSB) Hungry Children's  Committee had only identified 500  hungry children by June of this  year.  The Child Poverty Action Committee (CPAC), established as  a result of a April forum on  child poverty which alerted British Colombians to the problems of  hunger in the provinces schools,  presented a brief to the VSB in  late September urging stronger action on hunger issues.  The CPAC brief argued that  the school board should actively  seek funds for a universal food program in Vancouver schools to ensure that poor children are not  singled out. The CPAC says that  the VSB committee's actions, to  date consisting of further study,  further education for teaching staff  and more research into the effects of hunger on learning, are  not enough. It recommends that  the school board seek support  from the federal Canada Assistance Plan (CAP), which could  provide up to 50 per cent funding  for a food program. According to  the CPAC the school board could  also investigate the prospects of  hiring a consultant from the City  of Vancouver to actively seek CAP  funding.  A variety of other groups at the  school board meeting also urged  more concrete action. The British Columbia Association, of Social Workers asked the VSB "...  not to shirk their responsibility on  the basis that such needs are more  properly in the domain of other  government departments because  this excuse is unacceptable at a  time when the arm of government  most responsible — the Ministry  of Social Services and Housing —  has directly reduced income support levels for the first time in 60  years."  The British Columbia Nurses  Union (BCNU), also appearing before the VSB, said "If the school  board is to succeed in their mission  of providing an education to Vancouver's children they must address the problem of inadequate  nutrition. To this end we suggest  first, food and second, education.  The BCNU recommended that the  VSB "... consider a breakfast program and nutrition education."  Support for school food programs will only come from public  pressure and this need will not be  met until the public is informed by  major newspapers such as the Vancouver Sun and Province. Both  newspapers failed to report the  strong demands for a ftfbd program from a wide cross section of  community groups.  KINESIS //////////////////////^^^^^  Across Canada  Advisory council ducks  leadership on free trade  by Esther Shannon  Canadians who have come to  expect that the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of  Women will provide leadership  and activism on the major social,  political and economic policy issues confronting women in Canada  are in for a surprise when it comes  to the issue of women and free  trade.  A look at the Council's recently  released publications on women  and free trade discloses, at best,  a mixed and, at worst, a dangerously misleading message to Canadian women. As significantly, the  message to the federal government  and business, the key supporters  of the free trade initiative, is that  the Advisory Council is not going  to make waves about the impact of  free trade on women.  In October, the Council published three background papers  on free trade and its impact on  len, all presented with the disclaimer that the information in  each paper was "provided by the  author, and does not necessarily  fleet the views of the Council."  Two of the papers present re  search and analysis on the impact  of free trade in two key sectors,  manufacturing and services; the  other paper entitled "Free Trade  and Canadian Women: An Opportunity for a Better Future" attempts an overview, touching on  the key sectors and women as con-  A reader studying these papers  and attempting to draw some overall conclusions is left at a total loss.  The authors of the papers investigating the impact on women in  manufacturing and service industries present analysis and statistics  that lead inescapably to the conclusion that free trade will have  a profoundly negative impact on  women working in these sectors.  The author of the overview paper,  however, hails a bright future for  women, both as workers and consumers, if a free trade deal is consummated.  The paper on manufacturing,  co-authored by Ann Porter and  Barbara Cameron, and the paper on services, authored by Marjorie Cohen, agree that free trade  will mean an increase in unemployment for women in both sectors. Both also argue that wages in  these sectors will fall and working  conditions will be eroded. As well,  both agree that social services and  legislation affecting women, such  as equal pay and affirmative action, may be called into question  by Canadian employers who believe such services and policies put  them at a disadvantage when it  comes to competing with American business.  The third paper, prepared by  Katie Macmillan presents an overview of the issue and concludes  that "a free trade arrangement  with the United States would  improve economic prospects for  Canadian women."  Macmillan argues that women  "particularly in the service sector will face greatly expanded job  opportunities" and that "the removal of tariff barriers on goods  and services imported from the  United States would mean substantial savings for Canadian consumers." While Macmillan agrees  that women's employment in the  manufacturing sector could drop,  she says such industries are "already under intense international  competitive pressure."  South Africa  Commonwealth grapples with sanctions  by Nancy Pollak  Joseph Clark, Canada's Minister  of External Affairs, admitted to  "sanctions fatigue," eager Canadian officials romped on the giddy  heights of high moral ground, and  Brian Mulroney — for the first  time in a very long time — smelled  like a rose.  The Commonwealth Conference  has come and gone, and while  no gains were made on the central issue of sanctions against  South Africa, African leaders were  pleased that Canada's prime minister maintained a strong pro-  sanction position.  With Britain standing alone in  its refusal to endorse sanctions, the  remaining Commonwealth countries reaffirmed their belief that  "economic and other "sanctions  have had a significant effect on  South Africa and that their wider,  tighter and more intensified application must remain an essential  part of the international community's response to apartheid."  Britain, whose trade with South  Africa far exceeds that of all other  Commonwealth nations combined,  has steadfastly asserted that putting the economic squeeze on Pretoria will only 'hurt' Black South  Africans.  A recent poll of Black South  Africans revealed that fully 67 percent support full sanctions as the  appropriate means of forcing the  South African government to end  its 16 month-old state of emergency and, ultimately, to abolish  apartheid.  ir-^                           V  TANZANIA  /   ANGOLA     _T"~"N3  |                         ZAMBIA  ^-  \                (=^\ZIMBA8W  Imozamb"  QUE1  \        J Botswana)?—/  \ SOUTH AFRICA/  TU  Britain did, however, agree to  join Canada in providing economic  support to South Africa's neighbours, the front-line states.  Margaret Thatcher had been  expected to demonstrate Britain's  'abhorrence' of apartheid by promoting such aid measures, rather  than sanctions, and there was considerable worry that assistance to  front line states would overshadow  sanctions as the Commonwealth's  foremost anti-apartheid strategy.  Observers were satisfied this did  not happen.  The economies of the front line  states have traditionally been interwoven with South Africa's, producing a dependency that has  proven devastating. In addition,  Pretoria is waging unofficial war  with many of its neighbours: South  African-backed soldiers in Mozambique have destroyed rail and port  facilities, hamstringing that country's economy. (Mozambique was  granted observer status at this  —and the next —Commonwealth  conference.)  Vancouver anti-apartheid activists give Mulroney a mixed  review for his conference performance. While congratulating  Canada for defying the intransigent British, African National  Congress member Kerensa Lai  Thorn asserted that only total  sanctions, rather than Canada's  elective approach, will work.  "Brian Mulroney, in his speech  to the U.N. in 1985, stated that  Canada would sever all diplomatic and economic ties if South  Africa didn't move away from  apartheid. The time has now  come for Mulroney to keep his  word," said Lai Thorn. Describing  Canada's present level of sanctions  as "pretty good", Lai Thorn also  remarked that there were "loopholes everywhere."  Louie Ettling, active in various anti-apartheid groups, observed that Mulroney's progressive  stance gave organizers "something  to kick against, something to work  with in Canada."  Petro Canada continues to peddle Vancouver sulphur to Pretoria,  and Carolyn Jerome of the "Call  Off The Sulphur" group felt "no  enthusiasm, no progress" from the  conference.  Shell Canada and its Netherlands-based parent deal extensively with South Africa. This  fall, the anti-apartheid network  is gearing up for a major  Canada-wide boycott of Shell.  To get involved, or for details,  contact 734-1712 or 877-1287.  About the only thing all three  papers agree on is that major labour adjustment programs,  specifically geared to women, will  be required if Canada and the  United States conclude a free trade  treaty. In other words, a free trade  deal is going to have a major impact on women.  This is, apparently, the single  point of agreement that the Advisory Council has with the papers. In a press release accompanying the studies the Council says "Labour adjustment programs must be designed to accommodate the unique needs of  female workers and offer retraining programs with assistance for  childcare." The Council also states  that, for effective programs, "it is  essential that women's views be  taken into consideration."  According to Cohen, a leading  feminist economist and the author of a recently released book  on women and free trade, the  Council's intention to concentrate  on pushing for labour adjustment  programs is "pathetically inadequate."  "Calling for adjustment programs," said Cohen,  "is just one  minor thing ... Currently no adjustment program policy exists  with respect to free trade and  women's past experience shows no  great success with labour adjustment programs."  Sylvia Gold, Council President,  described the papers as fulfilling  the Council's mandate to bring issues of concern to women to public attention.  "We have taken leadership on  this issue ," Gold said, "in producing these documents ...   We are  fulfilling our goal of informing and  educating the public ..."    ^  "These three papers," said  Gold, "present three different perspectives because we don't have a  crystal ball on free trade ... We  hope women will use the papers to  make their own judgments."  According to Cohen the Council  approach is extraordinary. "Free  trade," Cohen said, "is going to  have a massive effect on women  and the government is not serious about studying this impact.  There were 72 studies done for  the MacDonald Commission (The  1985 Commission urged the government to negotiate a free trade  deal with the Americans) and as  far as we know not one of them  addressed women. This is an clear  indication of how seriously government is taking women's concerns.  "The Council must come out  strongly and advise the government not to go through with this  deal. It must take its role to speak  v much more seriously."  Gold agrees that the lack of  studies on women and free trade  is "a major problem" and says  that the Council will continue to  urge government to undertake this  work.  She does not, however, see the  Council advocating a position on  free trade, either for or  "We intend to continue to monitor issues around labour adjustment," said Gold. Aside from that,  Gold says "We've done our work  on free trade and we will be moving to a number of other areas that  need our attention."  Meech Lake  Parliament  approves accord  by Kinesis StafT Writer  The Meech Lake Accord was  passed by Parliament in late October with only a handful of Liberal and New Democrat members  of Parliament voting against the  agreement.  Women's groups opposed to the  accord seem, however, to have  found a new ally, amid continuous signs that the accord has less  than unanimous support amongst  Canadians.  Recently elected New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna has  expressed reservations about the  accord saying that he is uncertain the accord has adequate protection for women's and minority rights. McKenna has also criticized the accord's amending formula, which he says would block  any hope for an elected Senate.  McKenna's comments have rais  ed new hopes that English women's groups may yet get the accord  amendments they have been lobbying for since all provincial governments must approve the accord  before it passes into the Constitution.  The accord designates Quebec  as a "distinct society" and gives  the provinces a say in the makeup  of the Senate and the appointments to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  With the important exception  of women's groups in Quebec,  women's groups in Canada argue  that the accord's vague language  could allow Quebec to discriminate against women despite the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  They have urged that Section 16 of  the accord, which extends special  guarantees to aboriginal and multicultural groups, be expanded to  include women.  KINESIS      87 NOV. Across Canada  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Esther Shannon  Fines program unfair  According to recent provincial  Justice Department figures almost  half of the women jailed in Saskatchewan in fiscal 1985-86 were  behind bars because they did not  pay fines levied as alternatives to  prison. Figures show 43 percent of  women, compared to 32.6 percent  of men, served time instead of paying fines.  Aria Gustafson, executive director of the provinces Elizabeth Fry  Society said the difference between  the numbers of women and men  going to jail indicates a desperate  need for changes to the system.  She said some poor women, including single parents are unable to  take advantage of Saskatchewan's  fine options program because they  can't afford childcare.  The fine options program allows  offenders unable or unwilling to  pay fines the opportunity to work  for a given time instead of paying fines. The program would be  more fair if the government put up  money for babysitting according to  Gustafson.  Stillbirths increasing  Recent statistics are showing  the incidence of pregnancy loss, including miscarriage, among younger women is increasing to as much  as eight times greater for women  aged 20 to 30 than for women 30 to  35. Researchers believe that a sexually transmitted micro-organism,  ureaplasma urealyticum, may be  responsible for an increasing number of young women bearing stillborn babies after the fifth month  of pregnancy. Studies show that 85  per cent of sexually active adolescents have the organism in their  genital tract and it is thought  that younger women have been exposed to more genital tract microorganisms through having more  sexual partners than older women.  Ureaplasma urealyticum is sexually transmitted and grows like  bacteria in the genital tracts of  both men and women.  Incest award overturned  An Ontario incest victim has  had a $50,000 jury ordered compensation award overturned by the  justice presiding over the Ontario  Supreme Court case. Mr Justice  William Maloney ruled that the  woman's claim was nullified by the  statue of limitations.  The jury found that the woman's 56 year old father had committed incest against his daughtf  from the time she was eight ui  til she left home when she was ll  They awarded her $10,000 in general damages and $40,000 in punitive damages.  The statute of limitations normally provides that an action in an  assault suit must be started within  four years after the cause arises or  six years in the case of negligence.  The woman left home in 1973 and  did not start the action until 1985.  The woman's lawyer argued  that the statue of limitations pro  vides that the run of time is  stopped if a person is of unsound  mind when the action arises, and  that applies until the person becomes of sound mind. The Justice did not accept the lawyers  argument that the woman was  of unsound mind, despite testimony from a psychiatrist who  said the woman experiences numerous problems including insomnia, nightmares and phobias.  Gay rights  stalled  October 26 marked the second anniversary of the report  of the Parliamentary Committee  on Equality Rights which recommended that the federal government include sexual orientation as  a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human  Rights Act.  In the face of continued inaction from the government EGALE,  an Ontario based coalition of concerned individuals and groups has  launched a major drive to demand  that the Conservative government  enshrine protection for gays and  lesbians in the human rights act.  The National Action Committee  on the Status of Women (NAC)  is a strong supporter of the campaign and points out that "the  absence of equality rights legislation is an unacceptable signal that  the government condones discrimination against lesbians and their  families."  Canadians are urged to write  the Minister of Justice, Ramon  Hnatyshyn, House of Commons,  Ottawa, Ontario, KlA 0A6 asking that the government include  sexual orientation as a prohibited  ground of discrimination. Copies  of letters should be sent to Prime  Minister Brian Mulroney, Liberal  Justice critic Robert Kaplan and  N.D.P. Justice critic Svend Robin-  Legalizing  midwifery  A special task force on midwifery, set up after the Ontario  government promised to incorporate midwifery into its health care  system, has issued its report. The  task force calls for training and licencing of midwives as independent professionals, the establishment of a midwifery college to  regulate the profession and safeguards to guarantee standards of  midwifery practice. The report  also recommends that midwives,  in consultation with the medical  profession, prepare a protocol to  be used in assessing which mothers can safely give birth at home.  Ontario's Health Minister has announced she will seek reactions to  the report before taking any action  on its recommendations.  Quebec  farm women  organize  The newly formed Federation  des agricultrices du Quebec intends to teach farming women how  to protect themselves legally in  the event of a marriage breakdown  Pap smears cut cervical  cancer  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The incidence of death due to  cervical cancer among Canadian  women has dropped by over 50 per  cent since the development of pap  smears over 35 years ago. But from  1971 to 1980, the incidence of the  disease in women 15 to 24 years  old rose by 79 per cent, due possibly to an increasing trend to multiple sex partners.  Experts now agree that cervical cancer can be initiated only  by a sexually transmitted agent,  however they also hold that there  are a number of cofactors at work,  the most important of which is believed to be smoking. Interestingly,  barrier methods of birth control  are seen as helpful in reducing the  risk of cervical cancer.  While pap smear tests and early  treatment are working, medical research into the causes of the disease is continuing with much of  the work being done in Canada.  Since 1976, several human Papilloma viruses (HPV) have been  studied for malignant potential.  If  !«©Lf  and help farm women secure loans  from financial institutions.  Mariette Breniel, a founder of  the Federation, said that in the  past "women shared the farm work  but they weren't guaranteed anything." Women now account for 11  percent of Quebec farm producers,  up from four percent in 1984.  The association is made up of  regional women's farm groups and  has 1,400 members. It hopes to affiliate itself with Quebec's largest  farmers' association, L'Union de  producers agricoles, later this  year. The Quebec government contributed $165,000 to help set up  the association.  Government  funds  anti-choice  Alberta feminists are up in arms  over a federal government decision to fund a series of workshops  by the pro-life Alberta Federation of Women United for Families  (AFWUF).  The Federation, an affiliate of  Real Women of Canada, was  granted $5,800 from the Secretary of State for five workshops  at their annual November conference. According to Federation  board member, Lorna La Grange,  "It's the first time I think the government funded a pro-family, pro-  life, women's lobby group in North  America." The workshops include  topics such as lobbying, prostitution and child care.  Luanne Armstrong, of the Alberta Status of Women Action  Committee, noted that Secretary  of State funding guidelines prohibit groups from using government funding to fight the abortion  issue. "Whatever work we do on  the abortion issue, we do with private funding," Armstrong said.  SURVIVAL KIT FOR THE 80s  'op  Oo  <5o  <5p  <§>^>  =BT    ZJSZ  s s  t=i   <n  ftft  r\. typflflOOKfi.W  There are 46 known human Papilloma viruses that cause many wart  conditions, most of them benign.  Two particularly dangerous cervical infections caused by HPV-  16 and HPV-18 are currently being studied to determine the viral agent responsible for malignant  cervical growths.  Researchers have found that  HPV affects cattle causing warty  growths and scientists have been  able to develop an effective bovine  vaccine that offers hope for hu  man immunization. It is estimated, however, that the development of a human vaccine could  take as long as 12 years.  Pap smears are done to pick up  pre-cancer of the cervix, known  as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). According to one researcher, "If there is one good  screening test known, it's the pap  smear."  Treatments for pre-cancer, involving extreme heat (electrocautery) or cold (cryotherapy) as  well as laser vaporization and traditional surgery, are effective in  most cases.  There is controversy about the  stage at which treatment should  begin. What is unclear is the ma  lignant potential of what is known  as a flat condyloma, a wart like  growth. Some medical experts call  for treatment if the flat condyloma is observed, while others say  you are only treating the effect  of the virus, not the virus itself.  There is still not enough information to conclusively say whether or  when flat condylomata should be  treated.  It appears, however, that a  flat condyloma can develop into  a atypical condyloma and from  there follow through a number of  pre cancer stages to severe dysplasia (CIN 111) or carcinoma-in-  situ, a stage still treatable by the  above mentioned methods. Invasive cancer of the cervix, the final  stage, traditionally requires radical hysterectomy and radiation  treatment.  6    KINESIS Nov.   87 ///////////////////^^^^^  //////////////////M^^^  Health  Breast feeding activist  urges action and support  by Nancy Pollak  A billboard in east Africa.  In each massive panel, a cheerful African  woman demonstrates an aspect of breast  feeding. Her plump baby suckles happily,  held securely in the crook of her arm.  Mother carefully washes her nipple before and after the feeding. Healthy mother.  Healthy baby.  A government campaign promoting maternal and infant well-being? Not on your  life, says Margaret Kyenkya, a breast feeding activist from Kenya. This particular  public message was brought to the women  of Africa by Nestles, the infamous manufacturer of infant formula. It brims with misinformation.  "Look at how this baby is positioned [it is  incorrect]," says Kyenkya at her Vancouver  speak in October. "And this advert tells a  woman that you wipe your breast before  and after each feed. If you advise a woman  to wash her nipple on the day she delivers,  the following day her nipples will be hard,  the third day they'll be cracked, and she'll  be hooked on breast milk substitutes.  "The International Code states that information on breast feeding should be coming from experts, not from the manufacturers of baby food." It's not hard to see why.  The Code — the International Code on  the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes  passed by the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) in 1981 — is a prime tool used  by Kyenkya and the worldwide movement  against the multinational corporations producing infant formula [see box].  The Infant Feeding Action Coalition (IN-  FACT) Canada sponsored the cross-country  tour by Kyenkya, the former African Regional Coordinator for the Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), and her successor,  Christine Lwanga of Kenya.  Disturbing Trends  Kyenkya made it plain that neither the  1984 lifting of the Nestles boycott nor the  Code's near-unanimous passage (only the  U.S. voted against) were grounds for relaxed  vigilance by organizers. With annual sales  at $4 billion and growing, the infant formula  industry is as vigorous as ever.  "Statistics show that breast feeding rates  are on the increase in western countries. The  more educated women are, the more they  breast feed," said Kyenkya.  "In Africa it is the opposite, and I think  this applies to Latin America and Asia ...  breast feeding trends are going down, faster  than they were in the 60's."  The reasons are multifold. Traditional  home births are decreasing as women are  persuaded to use health facilities which  mimic western practices and actively discourage the establishment of lactation.  Increased urbanization and compulsory  schooling — the separating of mother and  child — are also leading factors.  A new threat to breast feeding are attitudes surrounding the AIDS epidemic. Although the HIV virus has been found in  the milk of infected women, there have been  no studies proving transmission. As one researcher said, "Before we in the west make  recommendations that will impinge on the  lives of some of the world's neediest people,  we need to consider it's effects ... an un-  proven attempt to prevent even one infant  infection [may] lead to-injury and death to  countless thousands ... from infection and  malnutrition."  The devaluing and maligning of breast  milk, described by Kyenkya as "a very valuable world resource we are allowing to go to  waste," has appalling consequences for babies.   .  It is estimated1 that 40,000 children die  daily in the Third World. Activists are convinced that many of those lives could be  saved by the nutrition and immunological  protection offered by breast feeding.  The economic consequences are also significant. "[INFACT Canada] predicted that  in the 80's, the developing world would be  spending at least $1 billion annually on formula ... that is more than the World Bank  was lending African nations in 1977 to settle their economic problems."  The economic drain is ludicrous on more  than the national scale: one study has shown  that a Kenyan minimum wage earner would  have to spend 32 - 67 percent of her pay on  formula.  Working women were of particular concern to Kyenkya. "One of the myths used to  encourage bottle feeding ... is that this is  a modern world and women in Third World  countries need to go out and work and, as  long as they work, they cannot breast feed.  "My question is, if we have to work, do  we then have to condemn ourselves and our  babies to a life of bottle feeding?"  The question can be applied globally.  The factors compelling Canadian workers  to stop breast feeding — employment conditions which simply won't accommodate a  nursing mother, and the absolute need to  earn money — are exaggerated for poor  Third World women. And, as Kyenkya said,  "[breast milk substitutes actually] increase  Margaret Kyenkya and her son. Mugada.  their load of work for nothing ... as long  as their babies are not breast fed, they get  sicker more often and the mothers spend  more time going to clinics."  Maternity leave legislation wouldn't help  the majority of women working in the 'informal' sector (such as sweat shops, stores and  rural areas). Citing a study showing that  unrefrigerated breast milk survives for over  8 hours, Kyenkya recommended that "we  support working women in learning how to  express milk, so they can leave it for their  babies."  Modern World, Disastrous Results  The 'modern world' issue crops up again  and again for Kyenkya, and it reveals a class  dimension. Wealthy Third World women eschew breast feeding, and poor women — rural and urban — emulate them with disastrous results.  Kyenkya described how, at the Women's  Decade Conference in Nairobi, 1985, her  group's display in the appropriate technology area didn't please everyone. "The  decision-makers — for instance, a woman  Minister of Health — didn't want to hear  about it. [It's] challenging her position: she  worked hard, she held her heart and left her  Nestles vs. the Third World  In the 70's, a global outcry against the aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes  in the Third World by multinational giants such as Nestles, Mead-Johnson and Wyeth resulted in a boycott against Nestles. Infant formula was — and continues to be — responsible for countless deaths: mothers are unable to understand cryptic labels, formula is overdi-  luted to make up for an inadequate supply, and a lack of clean water and sterile bottles  and teats exposes babies to deadly illnesses.  Worse still, bottle feeding deprives a baby of the essential nutrients and natural defenses  in breast milk, and robs both mother and child of an emotional bond.  The International Code grew out of this movement. Strengthened in 1986, the Code advocates the promotion of breast feeding and advises restrictions on the commercial behaviour of multinationals. For example, companies are not to supply free samples to hospitals, a prime route by which new mothers are seduced into bottle feeding.  The Nestles boycott ended in 1984 with the company agreeing to comply with the Code.  Since then, Nestles and the other firms have made a mockery of that promise. Free samples  are unloaded daily, in Kenyan hospitals, in Canadian hospitals. Attempts have been made  to compromise breast feeding action groups with promises of funding. Articles critiquing  the benefits of breast milk are planted in magazines.  The Code is a guideline only: to date, only four Third World countries have actually  made it the law of the land. In Canada, the federal government passes the buck to the  province and the province shrugs its shoulders, saying our hospitals are private and beyond legislation. And babies in Canada continue to die.   children behind and moved between men  and went up.  "Now you want to pull her back and bring  your babies crawling in her office. That's not  nice. We still have that to fight."  Kyenkya's work in Africa has been  energetic mix of grass-roots organizing and  government lobbying. D3FAN's network has  spread from Kenya to Zambia, Ghana,  Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Nigeria,  Uganda and Mauritius (they are not allowed into South Africa). Working closely  with traditional mothers' support groups  and health workers, IBFAN has succeeded  in keeping breast milk substitutes out of  many government hospitals. Private and  ligious mission hospitals still accept — and  - free formula samples.  Just Four Women  In Nairobi, a small volunteer group of breast  feeding counsellors made an enormous difference.  "Clinics can be very crowded ... 300  women waiting with their children. These  counsellors would go at six in the morning  and start shouting about breast feeding.  ^They have changed the situation ...  Nairobi so much that women in every part  of the city call them up to get help. Just  the four of them. Because of their work,  started getting funding ... the government  is starting to respond by having their own  employees promote breast feeding."  Li the 70's, African organizers relied  heavily on western anti-formula groups for  information and strategies. Now, the information and strategy flow has reversed.  Kyenkya described how an African colleague, invited to a breast feeding conference in Ireland, galvanized the isolated organizers into coordinated action.  She called upon Canadians to do the  same. "The person working with mothers in  the hospitals needs the link with the person standing on the street demonstrating,  and the link with the women in government  who are feminist."  For Kyenkya, it takes "getting the  courage to challenge the system; to say, yes  we want to be free, but with our children  along with us."

International  Mexico City women's centre has broad  goals  by Kim Irving  It's dusk and rainy in downtown Mexico  as I pass by the military police who guard  this corner day and night. Although they  pay little attention to passers-by, I still feel  unnerved. It is with a sigh of relief that I  spot the crescent women's symbol above the  name Cuarto Creciente on the nearby building. It tells me that I have arrived at Mex-  > City's first women's centre.  I am immediately welcomed into the  Centre and given a tour by Angie, one  of Cuarto's most dedicated workers. The  Centre is divided into several rooms: a  health room where women can receive alternative health care and birth control information, an art room that is used for  everything from photography to macrame;  " brary and documentation centre; and  for the more energetic feminist, a fully  equipped dance studio. Each Friday night  the'Centre hosts a coffeehouse with local entertainment, which provides enough funds  to keep the place open.  The Centre is situated on the site where  the statue of Coyolxauhqui was discovered.  This Aztec moon goddess, according to  myth and the women at Cuarto, was the  last matriarch to reign before the rise of patriarchy (she was murdered by her brother  who stole her crown).  While visiting the Centre I am able to  talk with Virginna Sanchez, founder and  coordinator of Cuarto Creciente. After  spending ten years in Europe where she  studied and was involved in the women's  movement, she returned to Mexico with  the dream of opening a women's centre.  Her personal funds went towards the first  month's rent and renovation of the Centre, where she lived for the first two years.  Cuarto Creciente is named for the day  that it opened, October 6, 1984, the eve of  the quarter moon.  Virginna, you spent some time in Europe during your twenties. Could you  tell me a bit about your experiences?  I arrived in Europe in '73 and returned  back to Mexico in '82. When I left I was  married. In those days women had to marry  in order to get out of the house. So here  I was, part of a traditional couple—and I  was dying. So I left for France. There, I  worked and also studied. I met some Latina  women and began to acknowledge my Latin  identity. I stayed in France for seven years  and came out as a lesbian through a very  intellectual process which started in our  women's group meetings where we knew  that the best of our energy and commitment  was with each other, yet we were always going home to our men each night. Eventually  we questioned "why are we going home to  men?" We began to realize our sexual feelings for each other.  When I returned to Mexico there was  not really an active movement here. I was  strong on the idea of building a women's  centre. I wanted to create a space where life  could have some continuity. I met with several groups and there was some positive and  negative feedback to my idea.  Cuarto Creciente t's Mexico city's first  women's centre. I understand you received some criticism after it was  opened. What was the criticism?  There was criticism that Cuarto wasn't  solely a lesbian centre—which was never  my intention. This doesn't mean I'm hiding my life, my identity, my love for women.  It's just we cannot reproduce the ghetto. I  thought Cuarto could be a stimulus for lesbian issues—I believe in common living.  And this past few years I've gone through  another process, that is beginning to relate  to men again. This is very much criticized.  It's been hard fighting the criticism from the  women I know—the ones I was formed with,  but I don't feel bad about my process at  all. At Cuarto now, you'll find a mixture of  women. You'll find women who don't know  how to read. You'll find secretaries ... and  this has been criticized.  I want to work for a place where women  are offered the chance to meet. Where their  prejudices are allowed to meet—and that  they face these prejudices. It is those prejudices that stop us from being able to work  together. Unless we allow ourselves to be  confronted with all women, or women's centres we don't like ... we are then only fooling ourselves and we are dividing ourselves.  And this only benefits the state.  In those days  women had to marry  in order to  get out of  the home.  Doing Something Together  It's been mentioned several times to me  that the 1985 earthquake was what initiated the formation of new groups in  Mexico. Where were you at the time of  the earthquake?  At the time of the earthquake several  women were living with me at Cuarto. Out  of six of them, four lost their family homes.  And one was about to have a baby. So, here  I was left alone again—one year after starting the Centre. I was ready to throw the  towel in! But, at that time, there was a  very desperate need. In the streets it was us,  the people, that organized the traffic, took  away the rubble, did the rescue work ...  it was very tragic but also very wonderful.  You see, it had been fifteen or sixteen years  since masses of people have done something  together (since the 1971 rock concert massacre). So after the earthquake our unity  was very strong. But there was also a very  fast attack by the state. They sent the army  in who tried to stop our work.  Since I was alone, I decided to concentrate on my neighbourhood, Cuarto's  cuorto  creciente  neighbourhood which was in the centro—  a very big and poor neighbourhood. This  was very fruitful. It was a whole new discovery for me finding all these strong beautiful women near me. And when they realized what Cuarto was they became very  supportive. Some more women moved in  with me, so we rented a space upstairs and  kept the Centre as a women's centre. There  were very poor women, middle class women,  women who had just left their homes. However, personal problems swallowed my energy and we never got to do as much outreach as we wanted. It's been a year and a  half since they left—and now they are just  returning.  This all sounds emotionally draining  I've learned it's worth sticking with it. To  stick out those natural emotional rhythms.  Since I don't live there any more, as of two  months ago, women who are new there and  women from the previous collective have no  one to direct them. So it's going through a  kind of a crisis—and I have to allow that to  happen instead of running to it and try and  fix it—solve the problems.  It's been hard for some women—all the  women working at Cuarto now are new to  feminism. I guess I haven't been very organized in their formation. I should have made  it easier for them to fit in—I realize this  now.  But I'm proud—I think we all can be  proud that we finance ourselves. We can pay  the Friday night bands, the phone and rent  and provide two small salaries. Of course,  my hope for Cuarto is that the women in  the neighbourhood will eventually take it  over, to satisfy their own needs.  In 1981 you went to the First Encuentro of Latin American and Caribbean Feminists in Colombia—what  was that like ?  In Colombia, I worked hard to organize  a lesbian workshop which everyone was opposed to initially. Everyone had their reasons; two of my Colombian friends said they  were tired of heterosexual women always  using them. However, the workshop went  ahead and in the first hour over 300 women  attended—practically the whole Encuentro!  Organizing Inside the Empire  What role did Mexican feminists play  in the Encuentro—from the first to the  upcoming fourth one in Mexico this October?  In Colombia there was six Mexican  women and I believe we played the big sister role. The second one in Peru was more  academic. Peruvian feminists have ten times  the structure compared to Mexico organizing. In the third one, in Brazil, I don't  think Mexicans played much of a role. In  this fourth, the role we are going to play  is going to come through the lesbian issues.  It's the only group that has considered having a lesbian look on the rest of reality.  Also, Mexican women should recognize that  the Colombians, Peruvians and Brazilians  have experience in organizing Encuentros.  We are fooling ourselves by taking it so easy.  ... we knew that  the best of our  energy and  commitment was  with each other..  I have been quite frustrated with the coordination of the fourth. They have been  quite deaf to my suggestions that we have  the geographic privilege to be meeting with  our Chicana sisters, whose political and  feminist experiences are totally different  than ours. We have a lot to learn from them  and they have a lot to learn from us. This  social change that we visualize will not come  about by isolating ourselves. We have to go  KINESIS INTERNATIONAL  ///////////////A  In order  not to fall  into the traps  of the state  we need  long term  visions  beyond our national limits. American Latinas and the Third World are very strong—  and we would be stronger if we were organized inside the empire. So, I'm very frustrated that I haven't been able to communicate this to the organizers in the last two  years.  But feminists here and the left must  be continuously bombarded with Americanism ... plus you've had the privilege of living abroad and being a part of  other movements.  Yes. I think having studied in the U.S.  and Europe, having the privilege of being  able to go back and forth, helped me see the  use of combining information. Like, learning about the Italian feminist struggle—how  they were torn to pieces and where they are  now—and sharing that information so that  we don't have to go through the same experiences ourselves. But there is a common  prejudice amongst different political lefts—  at least in Latin American countries. When  you talk about the social struggles somewhere else, when you make some kind of  analogy, they think you are imposing left  imperialism. Of course, you have to be careful you're not, but sometimes we don't recognize what we can gain from learning from  other struggles.  Have the Encuentros assisted in  forming the Latina feminist movement?  Very much. They have helped us focus on  producing a common strategy. It's where we  have been able to meet outside patriarchal  institutions. It's where women have started  talking about our sexuality, birth control  or our demographic repressions. And where  we've been able to go back to our countries  with new information and tools. Between  the two years of the Encuentro's we visualize and verbalize our commitments as a continental movement.  You also attended the International  Lesbian Conference in Geneva in 1986.  What   was   gained   there  for  Mexican  Seven months after the earthquake, we  went to Geneva. Everything on our minds  was absorbed with the last few months of  rebuilding our society. Our whole existence  had been helping people who were living in  the streets—who had no food, no clothing,  illness ... In Geneva, I was hoping for international support—developing a network.  No one wanted to hear anything. Only the  Danish women were open.  Geneva was so racist! Right from their  application forms they sent in the mail ...  funds were available for the blind, disabled,  the black—it's so absolutely ignorant to put  us in those terms! We are not the blind.  We are not the Black. We are not the  Latinas. Come on!  At Geneva I found the white women  and the European women very guilty over  their racism—actually paralyzed and immobilized by their guilt. There was this pretense there: "Oh, we'll send you our money  or we'll send you our left over magazines."  There was no acknowledgement from them  of what they learn from us. Or it comes  out in a very 'touristic' attitude "Oh, those  Latinas they're such good dancers!" But I  am also fed up with the Third World attitude of victimizing ourselves. We all have  to change our roles. We have to come out  of our roles of always asking for money and  they have to come out of their roles of "Oh,  yes, here—take half my sweater." We are so  different. We have a lot to learn from each  other.  Perhaps we are not ready to meet  globally yet?  I guess not. That's sad. Because that  means more war, more hardship—more  women being oppressed.  Revolution?  The left in Mexico has tried several  times to unite left communities—the  feminist community, the lesbian/gay  community. The decision to work with  the left has divided feminists in the past.  Do you feel women should work with the  left?  As feminists we need to tell the left that  the source of exploitation of women isn't  necessarily in the industries, but in the fam  ily. They need to expand their thinking on  social oppression. I think feminists have to  go through a separate movement, unless we  are willing to go deeper into analysis of our  movement. At this point we have nothing  to give or say to the left. We have to work  on ourselves. After that we can work with  them and not be swallowed by them.  As feminists we need to talk about what  we want in the long term. A problem with  most movements in the world is they don't  practice the long term vision. The Mexican  left doesn't even have the will for power yet,  let alone a specific project with a long term  goal.  So who is the left movement in Mexico?  The Coalition of the Communist party is  the largest left movement which is a combination of five left parties, formed after  1968. The Trotsky movement is on and off.  In Mexico there's no channels of finding out  what's happening in different regions. In  Oaxco there's a strong coalition of students,  peasants and workers who put communist  people into the government. Now that area  is sort of a free territory in Mexico. The  president can't even go in—government officials can't go in. If they did there literally would be war. This is something that  has sustained itself for the past six years. In  the north, people are trying to defend their  land—we are not aware of how ready and  armed they are. It's scary to think how we  are not together.  What is the Mexican government's  attitude to women?  Totally patriarchal. Mexico has very  much maintained its macho stereotype. It's  in our language, customs and behaviors.  The fear of women is very strong and this  has been the government's attitude.  So how is the feminist movement in  Mexico?  We are more alive than most movements!  In the media you find feminist writers. We  only have one feminist magazine Fern (see  box), which is sad. There's plenty of women  organizing in the grassroots. But what's  lacking is a common analysis and discussion. Women are scared of that and pretend  we are bound not to communicate. Being  here" the last five years after being away the  ten years before—I can see how the government is so powerful and intelligent in slowing down political movements. Plus, we are  very soothed by Latina slowness ... I don't  know how else to explain it.  Are you in favour of state funding?  Generally I'm opposed—there's not  enough discussion on state funding. In order not to fall into the traps of the state we  need long term visions. Previous to funding we need to meet because when there's  money, in any country, groups break each  others arms and legs to get at it!  There's some discussion in the left  movement here of revolution. Do you  believe that a revolution will solve the  problems?  No. I don't believe in revolution. I've seen  Cuba, China and the socialist countries in  Europe. They're not at all the societies that  I envision. Cuba, which is the closest to  Mexico, I have been able to visit the most.  Fidel (Castro) has a lot of merits but he's  also just one big patriarchy. Nothing has  changed for women in the home. Women are  still expected to work in the home as well as  outside. Sure, abortion is legal and free and  divorce is legal and free, but there's still a  macho attitude towards women.  So I don't envision those kind of changes,  especially those that go through violence. I  know we have to go through the violence but  I also know that's not the solution. Yet the  violence is happening here already, now. In  different areas of Mexico peasants are being  killed every day.  Unless there's a deep change in our consciousness, fighting with arms will get us  nowhere. Being critical is our best weapon.  Fern: voice for Mexican women  by Kim Irving  Fern started in 1976, with only two  women who were reacting to the lack of reporting on the Mexico women's movement.  And, this last year the women of Fern celebrated their tenth anniversary. Published  monthly, Fern remains the only consistent  voice for Mexican women.  The magazine, surprisingly, survives on  advertising and the few subscribers they've  gained over the years. Their distribution  runs as high as 15,000, mostly in the Mexico City area. They have a growing international audience and are continually looking  for more.  However, Fem has largely been an "academic journal used for research," said collective member Elena Urrutia. "Although  we would like to reach more  Campesina  women ... we also know our limitations."  These limitations are that collective m  bers are from an older generation within the  academic community and that getting the  magazine distributed to Mexico's rural areas is expensive and nearly impossible.  Fem is working to change this. Their first  step was to hire a new director, a younger  woman, who will hopefully draw in new,  younger readers. Her influence is already evident with the new column "muchtia" written by and for younger women. This, and  new design changes, will certainly keep Fem  in the centre of the growing Mexico women's  movement.  To contact Fem: Difusion Cultural Fem-  inista, A.C. Av. Universidad 1855, 40. Piso.

KINESIS       87 N0> by Esther Shannon  The following interview with retired stripper and sex trade activist Amber Cooke is an  excerpt from the Toronto Women's Press recently published Good Girls, Bad Girls: Sex  Trade Workers Confront Feminists, edited by Laurie Bell.  The book is largely a compilation of the proceedings from the "Challenging Our Images:  The Politics of Pornography and Prostitution" conference held in Toronto in November of  1985. It also includes a number of interviews with sex trade workers and activists.  The conference, which marked the first time sex trade workers and feminists met in  Canada, was organized as a result of a controversy between Toronto's March 8th Coalition and the Canadian Organization for the Rights of Prostitutes (CORP). The prostitutes rights group objected to Coalition plans to include, in its 1985 International Women's  Day literature, statements that porn shops along Toronto's Yonge Street were harmful to  CORP argued these statements did not represent the views of women employed in the  sex trade. After debate the Coalition decided to withdraw the statements.  CORP's objections, however, spurred a continuing discussion in the Toronto women's  movement between sex trade workers and feminists. CORP had two major issues it wanted  feminists to address: How could feminists and sex trade workers begin to talk to one another? And what would be feminists' response to two government reports—the Report of  the Committee on Sexual Offenses Against Children and Youth (Badgley Committee report, 1984) and the Report of the Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution  (Fraser Committee report, 1985). One result of these discussions was the decision to hold  the Challenging Our Images conference.  Feminism challenged  A Distinctly Canadian Conference  Li the introduction to Good Girls, Bad Girls, editor Laurie Bell, who served as a member of the conference organizing committee, notes that the agenda for the conference was  "quite broad, extending beyond the two questions posed to the March 8th Coalition to include various cultural, historical and political perspectives on pornography, prostitution,  and the images of women in our society."  Bell identifies the two key concerns of conference organizers as ensuring that the conference included representatives from across Canada and that the issues of pornography  and prostitution be examined from a Canadian perspective and from within the Canadian  context.  According to Bell, the conference "was unique because it included the participation of  such a variety of points of view: women and men, prostitutes and non-prostitutes, anti-  pornography activists and anti-censorship activists." Bell notes that "... the ability to bring  together such a diverse group may be distinctly Canadian. It seems that in other places  the separate camps meet in separate quarters."  By the time the conference took place in Toronto, the federal government's response to  prostitution in Canada, Bill C-49, had passed its third and final reading. It is now Section  195.1 of the Criminal Code.  The law gives police sweeping arrest powers and has been deemed an attack on individual liberty by a wide cross section of Canadian society. Many have argued that the law  is only workable if police use entrapment tactics. Of major concern to prostitute's rights  groups is that the law threatens prostitutes' lives by forcing them to work in more isolated  areas away from the security of working in pairs or groups.  A recent Metro Toronto Police report on prostitution indicates that the new law is not  effective. Figures from the report note that while conviction rates have increased, this has  had little effect on prostitution as the number of female prostitutes working in Toronto has  more than doubled in the past year.  According to Inspector James Clark of the Toronto police force, "When the number (of  prostitutes) increases with enforcement, that tells you there is no deterrent value. From  the standpoint of reducing it, I don't think we are winning it at all.  "I don't think higher fines and prison sentences for females is the answer," Clark said.  "I think the answer has to come from social scientists."  New federal proposals for legislation to control pornography are still on the back burner  and are unlikely to be introduced in Parliament this fall. The current proposals were introduced as Bill C-54 in May of this year.  The new bill, a revamped version of a June, 1986 effort—Bill C-114—defines six categories of pornography that would be illegal to produce, import, or sell in Canada. Included  in these categories are depictions of "attempting to cause or appearing to cause ... impairment of the body" and "sexually violent conduct" as well as "masturbation ... ejaculation  ... and vaginal, anal or oral intercourse." The sale of sexually explicit material would be  prohibited to anyone under the age of 18 and the bill would prohibit the depiction of anyone under the age of 18 or who "appears to be" under the age of 18.  Opposition to the government's proposals has been intense. Feminists, artists, civil libertarians and others have denounced Bill C-54 for a variety of reasons ranging from opposition to censorship of any sort to fears that the government makes no distinction between  erotica and violent pornography.  Since the Challenging Our Images conference the CORP has become a member of the  National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC), thus furthering communications between sex trade workers and feminists.  CORP resolutions at the 1986 NAC annual meeting called for the repeal of Bill C-49,  opposition to "any and all legislation which seeks to limit the personal and business lives  of adult prostitutes and support for prostitutes to work for "empowerment in their working agenda." Despite opposition these resolutions were approved and a NAC Prostitution  Committee was formed.  In 1987 the Prostitution Committee brought forward further resolutions, including repeal of Criminal Code sections that deal with living "off the avails" (of prostitution) and  opposition to the forced testing and/or quarantining of prostitutes for AIDS and other  sexually transmitted diseases. Committee members acknowledge there is no unanimity in  NAC about prostitute's rights.  Organizing work against the proposed pornography legislation is on-going with coalitions active in Toronto, Vancouver and elsewhere.  According to Laurie Bell, feminists need to do three things to build understanding and  support for women working in the sex trade. Bell says feminists must "continue our dialogue  about analyses of and strategies toward pornography and prostitution,... move beyond the  identified feminist community and initiate and maintain a relationship with women working in the sex trade ... and take public action ... to respond to legislative changes and the  results of their implementation."  Good Girls, Bad Girls presents the full range of issues and analyses that confront feminists concerned with prostitution and pornography. Kinesis has chosen to excerpt the interview with Amber Cooke because she represents a voice seldom heard in the feminist  press ... the voice of a woman who has worked in the sex trade.  Sex trade workers:  Fitting politics and survival together  |  by Laurie Bell  Laurie Bell: During your eighteen  years as a professional stripper, what  was your perception of your place in the  culture of the sex trade and within the  wider dominant culture?  Amber Cooke: I had always believed feminism to be personal empowerment, and  the choice to be a stripper—to be my own  boss, to be my independent power source,  to be creative, to express myself fully, without terms of bureaucracy or established  norms—was in fact personally empowering.  The women who were in this trade supported each other in finding themselves and  empowering themselves in whatever undeveloped aspects or areas they chose, unhampered by a particular value system outside  that world. So it was the value system in  that world that actually enabled us to empower each other.  Bell: Many feminists might feel that  within the culture of the sex trade  there's no place for women to have personal empowerment.  Cooke: That's not so. That may be the  perception of an outsider, but for women involved in it, there is a whole different reality. The business is run by capitalists, people who want to make a profit, so of course  it's set up to their advantage. The whole  situation—from the dressing rooms to the  stage presentations to the sound system to  the lighting system to the practice of pay-  ■ ing star status to the money received—are  all set up by men for profit. But what the  io KINESIS  women actually do, our work, while it is under their jurisdiction, is still up to us. So  yes, our work is controlled, but what we do  when we work isn't.  Bell: How much control do the men  in the audience have over the women  who are stripping?  Cooke: No control at all. Although with  table-dancing they have some control. But  table-dancing, once it was brought back,  gave power to the audience. Now they can  pick and choose who they want to come and  dance at their table, and of course the competition is great because wages have been  cut. And so to make your wages up, you  have to then pamper the male in whatever  he chooses for you to do. But when there  are stage shows and only stage shows, the  power is outside of their hands and in the  hands of the woman. She embraces it, she  puts forth what she sees as entertainment  and erotic. And they're the audience.  Bell: In society as sexist as the one  we find ourselves in, do you think the  men that are in the audience can distinguish between real women and strippers as an act, as entertainment?  Cooke: Sure they know that. The struggle for male and female roles right now  in our society is very difficult. It's painful  as you grasp new inner truths and try to  deal externally with them and with whoever  your partner or co-workers may be. But to  come to a strip club—of course it's a fantasy. Reality is outside the door; this is now  fantasy. This is a place in which to relax  and not have to worry about all of what it  takes in relating your identity with reality  and co-operating with others. So they get  to come in and put that aside. They know  that they are interacting with the women  outside the door—their wives, their sisters,  their daughters, their mothers—in a fuller  capacity. They know the difference.  Bell: What about the accusation that  seeing strippers and looking at porn sets  up unrealistic expectations in men of  their wives or their partners? Things  that women at home can't live up to?  Cooke: I can't see that as the problem  of pornography. I can see the problem of  men relating to women. All of us can go to  any media—movies, shows, books—and if  we base our real life interactions with people on any of that, we're going to be mistaken; we are going to come out short in the  end. I don't believe that pornography contributes to that. It is men's responsibility as  human beings to relate to women as whole  human beings.  Bell: As a child it is hard to see teachers as a whole people. You see them  only in the role of teacher. Isn't it a bit  the same with women working as strippers? It's very hard for me to imagine them outside of that role. How do  they live? Who do they relate to? Do  they have friends? There's been such a  stigma about women who work in the  sex trade that the rest of us never meet  them in our daily lives.  Cooke: You probably do all the time  but just don't know it. When you're very  young, you don't have a full sense of self  yet, so to look at a person and imagine their  full sense—of course it's difficult; it's beyond your consciousness. But as you become  aware of who you are and what your destiny  is, especially as a teenager, when you start  to realize your own sexual desires, your own  sexual struggle, you can realize that other  people have that too. The more aware you  are of yourself, the more you can understand  that other people have other aspects you  might not see. When you sit down and think  about it, you know that everyone has a life.  These people don't just magically come to  life once they're on stage or in a club.  Bell: Because the sex trade is kept as  a separate subculture, one of the consequences seems to be that people in the  dominant culture have no idea about the  lives of women working in the sex trade.  Cooke: Yes, and that's partially created  by the women in the sex trade themselves.  They want to create a great deal of that  isolation, that barrier, for their own protection. So as much as the dominant society wants to look the other way so that it  doesn't have to deal with this whole group  of people that it doesn't understand, we try  to keep it away too. As soon as it gets hold  of some information or knowledge, there's  books written, there's articles written—  there's all kinds of information coming out  distorted through society's own biases. Not  from what our life actually is. So yes, we  want to protect ourselves from the curiosity, the exploitation, the thrill seekers who  are just going to take a peek and then use  their own imagination from there.  Bell: How safe is it for a woman to  work as a stripper in this city?  Cooke: A lot safer than being a hooker. A  lot safer. Politicians and the law still keep  the women as sitting ducks though. They  can still come into a club and enforce "inde  cent acts" or "obscene acts"; they have various by-laws under which they can charge  the woman, but it's up to their discretion.  And now that they've made the taking off  of the G-string your "option" (although it's  not your option—it's mandatory if you want  work), to take it off means that you are at  the mercy of the whim of anyone that comes  in and chooses to fine you or charge you. So  power has been taken away from the woman  and put with the audience, with the club  owners, and with the police. No longer does  the woman run her own business.  Bell: If you could ask the feminist  movement, the women's movement, for  things on behalf of women who work in  the sex trade, what would they be? What  needs to be said to feminists on behalf  of women in the sex trade ?  Cooke: We need a multi-faceted solution.  It's not as simple as what we need support for or what we need changed. It's  not one or two issues. The women in the  sex trade themselves need consciousness-  raising. They need to be able to understand that they have the ability to change  things. They feel that they're powerless because managements keep any talk of organizing outside of the doors, if you are found  to be one that wants to unite the people or  bring them together, to change something,  to change the law, or to strike in a club,  to picket a club, or to take a club owner to  court for not paying you, you're not hired.  You're blackballed. You get a mark against  you. So it has to start with women understanding that they have the power.  Bell: And do you think feminists can  be useful with that?  Cooke: They can be, but they haven't  been so far.  Bell: Part of what's being suggested  here is that feminists should get to know  sex trade workers, that they should lend  their support to sex trade workers, and  that sex trade workers are a3 legitimately a part of what we have called the  feminist or women's movement as any  other women.  Cooke: More so than some. We've been  out there doing our own thing, fighting all  the fights that you possibly can to be females in any way we choose, and that's our  right and our power. We were out there  doing it long before the feminists came in  and started picketing clubs, saying that we  were exploiting ourselves. We've been self-  employed people with our own social aid,  our own society, our own system for a long  time, based on our power as women. And  then the feminists come in and want to fight  us. Now in getting them to support us, we  have to train them not to fight us! That's  one of the first steps.  Bell: So perhaps the question really  is: what do sex trade workers have to  offer feminists or the women's movement?  Cooke: Betty Friedan says that every  woman has the right to say yes and no.  You've got to have the choice to say yes or  no to what job you're going to have and to  your sexuality. It's up to the woman herself. I can't see a group of women coming in,  calling themselves feminists, who are ready  to put into gear a structure as oppressive as  the male structure. And claim that they are  in fact helping these women out.  Bell: How do you think sex trade  workers can get that message to feminists?  Cooke: I just keep thinking that if feminists could understand that we in fact want  to do this work and then enable us to do so.  Every time a feminist agency or organization does come to our assistance, it helps a  little bit. Once the women understand that  they can go to feminists, because the feminists understand what sort of information  they're receiving, and once the feminists  learn to define the problems of the women  in the sex trade—once we have an open dialogue and good communication, we will be  putting the power back into the women's  hands. I think that's the only way to do it.  Bell: But for a woman who works in  an escort service or on the street—when  she hears the word 'feminist,' what do  you think that brings to mind?  Cooke: Most of them have an impression  that feminists are asexual women. In feminist politics there has to be more than just  cut-and-dried intellectualizing and theorizing about what should be and shouldn't be.  We need to deal with what t's, and instead  of relatbg to the women in the sex trade  through the rhetoric or the theory, understand the women.  Bell: Some feminists think that the  best thing they can do for these women  is to help them get out of the trade.  Cooke: Why?  Bell: Because they say women are  getting hurt there, women are being exploited, women are spending their lives  and their work being at the service of  men.  Cooke: That's their judgment. These people choose to do that. As women. It's like  the Roman Catholic judge who wants to  base laws on his particular belief of what  sin and corruption are. You can't do that.  You can't walk in and be that person that  says, "Based on my beliefs, everyone has to  do this. It has to be my way because this is  my value system." You can't do that.  Bell: Do you think that feminists are  placing a moral judgment on sex trade  workers?  Cooke: I think they're transferring their  fears. Most women in one way or another  understand the power of their sexuality.  But a lot of women are afraid of that  power, of how to hold the power, of how  to use that power. And when they are confronted with someone who's comfortable doing that, it shakes them up. It challenges  them. It makes them question themselves.  When that happens, you become threatened and defensive; you react on that basis.  The woman who is happy with her sexuality, quite satisfied to embrace it, embark on  it, dance with it, enjoy it, then becomes the  feared person. I don't believe it's so much  morals as it is fear. That's why I say feminists are new at this. They're just coming along saying, "Own your own sexuality,"  whereas we've been doing it for a long time.  We haven't been making a big deal out of  it—just doing it.  Bell: For you there is no contradiction between a woman being a stripper  and a feminist at the same time.  Cooke: How are they different? It's like  saying this mammal is a cat. Same thing.  You can be a stripper and a stalwart feminist, you can be a feminist and a stripper—  it goes hand in hand. I know women who  are feminists who don't understand what  it is to embrace their own power. It's only  an intellectual concept for them that they  are struggling constantly to achieve. I know  women in the sex trade who don't struggle  to embrace their own power either. They're  women who seek their approval from outside  sources. That's the struggle for women. If  there's a common denominator that would  bring us all together, it is that we are all  learning to seek our own approval, especially in terms of sexuality. That's our bond.  Wherever you're coming from, you are not  exempt from that common denominator.  Bell: Has working on the pornography  and prostitution conference, being at the  conference, working with the Elizabeth  Fry Society, affected your perceptions of  feminism?  Cooke: It's given me the opportunity to  see that feminists actually want to help.  There's a real concern there. How founded  their concerns are, and the perspective from  which those concerns are viewed, is something else again. But we all need education  and training. I need training to understand  why the feminist takes her stand and how  that works for her, and she needs to know  that about me.  con't next page  KINESIS GOOD (ill  MD GIRLS t  :on't from previous page  Bell: What do you think could be a  good way for that exchange to happen?  Cooke: That's difficult. A conference is  very good. More public talks, more public speeches, more shows. Right now it's  at the stage of this brand-new relationship.  We're developing trust. That's what we really should be doing right now. All the ways  in which you develop trust should be put  into gear and acted on. Once there is open  communication and trust established, then  both of us can know better how to help the  other. But right now this is a very, very  new thing; it's very tender and gentle. And  rather than get into the militant stage much  before it's time, let's just develop that trust  through books, the media, getting people to  talk.  Bell: What about the more informal  gatherings? It seems that the conference because of its public nature, was  a disadvantage to sex trade workers. It  was risky for them to come and identify  themselves as sex trade workers.  Cooke: That's not the real problem,  that's not the problem that kept them from  being there. The women who are political, who are sex trade activists, are a very  small handful of women. And they'll come  to all these public talks; they'll keep coming. The names will keep popping up all the  time. But women who are out there, who  are on the borderlines, who are fighting for  survival, have not yet been able to indulge  themselves, or afford the opportunity, to develop a political analysis. Therefore they see  all this political activity around this issue  as outside of their realm. They don't understand that they're the living politics of  it. Within themselves they're political, but  they don't know that they are. They don't  know what is happening at these conferences, and they're not ready to come forth  and be part of it.  Survival and politics are two different  things. Engaging in politics is a luxury, but  if you're really, really busy just having to  make your money, to keep your ends together, you're going to take all the hours  you can to make your money. You're not going to be taking great huge gaps of time tor  meetings.  If you went out through Toronto and  found ten sex trade workers you wanted to  talk to, number one, you'd pay them because their time is money. No one's come  up with that one yet.  Sex trade workers are economically and  emotionally vulnerable. It's about their  work. And it's been so mishandled so of  ten. It's horrible to come and listen to what  people have to say, and their attitudes, and  struggle through all that. Especially when  it's taking up your time and money. It's a  lot easier to walk out the door and go back  and do what you're doing with people that  know what you're doing. Where everyone  isn't standing around analyzing what you're  doing and talking about it for hours.  It's the same as any kind of thing with  politics and the peasants: keep the peasants  so much on the line that thinking about  feeding their families is all they have time  for. They don't have time for politics—they  can't. It's all in somebody else's hands. It  doesn't matter which way the politics go—  they still have to struggle day after day for  food Put that in the woman's terms too. It  doesn't matter what new laws are made, it  doesn't matter who shifts power, it doesn't  matter what conferences are going on or not  going on—she still has to make her bucks.  Say you came on the street and said, "I'll  offer you affordable housing if we can get a  thousand of you together this Saturday afternoon. You'll all sign a petition, and you'll  all get an apartment that you can afford to  live in." They would be there. That's practical. Sitting around and talking about what  they're doing for hours and hours isn't practical.  Bell: Do women in the sex trade want  to see some sort of tangible support  from feminists? Is this the way the feminists need to go in order to make alliances with women in the sex trade?  Cooke: Absolutely. How were any of the  great unions in the States made? People  didn't just go around and talk to workers; they went out there and worked with  them. They'd live with them. The organizers would help the dying babies. And once  the organizers know the life of the people  and are with the people, then they can go  and make changes because then you have  the people's support.  So far everyone is just talking about the  sex trade. Practical manoeuvre are needed.  Come to their court cases, come to their  houses, come to their lives, get involved with  them, help them to help themselves. Practical manoeuvre. With the whores it's pretty  cut and dried; it all really revolves around  C-49 right now. With the strippers it's altogether different.  Bell: How is a feminist supposed to  get to know a stripper? Where do we  meet each other?  Cooke: What are your likes and dislikes?  What do you do in your spare time?  Bell: Go to meetings, just like your  average feminist! Chances are that I'm  not going to meet strippers or hookers  at meetings.  Cooke: It depends on the meetings. Go to  a few Al-Anon meetings. You'll meet some.  Join the Beat the Street literacy campaign.  Go to places where they would go to. I  have a friend who spends all day Sunday in  church; she plays the organ. You could go  to her church and talk to her between sermons. A lot of the women have children. Go  to day care centres, meet the moms. Where  would you meet any woman? We don't have  clubs for strippers only. We work in public  places. Go into a club and buy her a drink;  say that you just want to talk to her.  Bell: In the United States, at least,  there seem to be women-only escort services and strip clubs run by women for  women. It seems like there's no big deal  about it there.  Cooke: We've received our greatest support from the lesbian community because  they are fully supportive of recreational sex;  the sex between them is not procreative.  So they've backed us 100 percent. Sure, sex  is fun. We know that. Never mind babies.  Sure.  I think guilt about recreational sex is the  overriding issue. Each one of us carries a  little piece of that. When we sit down and  confront one another, our fears keep coming  up. People fear women in the sex trade because they don't understand what that little  switch is that they've turned on that makes  it okay for sex to be just for fun or a commodity to sell. They don't understand how  they've taken away the guilt of the church  or the rest of the culture to see it in a much  clearer perspective. It may not match your  morality system, but sex trade workers are  much more clear on what sex is for them.  Bell: Are women forced into the sex  trade ?  Cooke: There are women working as waitresses, as legal secretaries, as librarians, as  nurses, and that may be the only thing they  can do. So that's what they're going to do.  And then there's women who celebrate in  their occupation or careers. It's the same  with women in the sex trade. Some feel they  are victims. Some are victims. And then  there are also others who have made that  choice and celebrate that choice. We're not  so different.  The whole difference is viewing sex as a  commodity or as recreation or as entertainment. When you take sex out of the traditional, intimate bonding process, it becomes  something else.  Bell: And that's okay?  Cooke: Of course! How many things in  our lives are totally acceptable because they  bring us pleasure? Most things are supposed  to be means to an end. Take the Catholic  view of sex as strictly procreative. Pd rather  be a whore than a Catholic.  People will actually pay for sex, and that  makes it a valuable commodity to a woman.  That's her right. As long as people are willing to buy sex, there will be people who  choose to make their living in the sex trade.  Unless we return to the temple prostitutes,  who did it for God.  Bell: It has been said that the  women's movement won't really be a  women's movement unless it includes  whores.  Cooke: Absolutely. There are a lot of  whores that are there; they just don't state  that they are. So let's get honest about this.  And how can any women's movement be a  true representation of women without representing all women?  Whatever level of political consciousness  women in the sex trade are at, the best  thing for them is to be matching up with a  group of women in the feminist movement  who are open to them and can do something  to support them. So even apart from the infighting on both sides of this issue, the networking has to be done very carefully or we  are going to be throwing ourselves even further into their chaos.  Sex trade workers don't want much more  than anybody else out there doing their  work. They want working conditions that  are hygienic and conducive to doing their  business. They want money for the work  they do. One of the things that all feminists  could do for all sex trade workers is really  simple: make sure that the health standards  for the dressing rooms are up to scratch. Ensure that there is a toilet, that there is some  sort of ventilation, and that there are heat  and light. Those are really basic things yet  the working women can't get it for themselves.  Go into a club and find out what kind of  air system they have to get rid of the smoke  so we're not all choking and going blind in  there. Go down to the dressing room and  get rid of all the drips that force you to wear  something on your feet all the time because  the floor's wet. There's no proper light,  there's no place to hang up your clothes, so  they sit on the back of the chair and fall  into these puddles. That would be a good  place to start because then the women know  you're on their side. When they don't have  pneumonia that winter, they'll remember  the feminists.

Randall  When the school buses started to roll  again this year I was not ready. I had recently undertaken a new career as a good  time girl and I discovered that I was pretty  good at it. I had a lot of fun last summer.  Then school started and I had to start getting out of bed at 6:30 in the morning. This  is half an hour later than I had to get up last  year but it was about two and a half hours  earlier then I'd like. I am not one to suffer  in silence, and since I have my own car this  Rawnie Dunn  year I could stay after the morning shift and  go to coffee with some of the other women  drivers. What I heard over coffee shut me  up pretty fast. It also left me wondering,  once again, about the amazing relationship  between work, money and women.  One woman at coffee was rolling out of  bed at 4 a.m. to drive her grandson to his  babysitter in Burnaby and put him back to  bed there before driving into Vancouver to  punch in at 6:30. Another woman always  gets up at 4:30. She needs a while to think  before she starts the drive to work at 5:30.  About a third of the drivers at this company are women. It's a good job. We're  unionized and our rate of pay makes this  a possible job for single mothers. But only  because it leaves open so many hours in the  day when they can make money at another  job. One single mother is driving school bus  during the week, waitressing at a nearby  restaurant between the morning and afternoon runs, then driving handicap buses on  the weekends.  Another mother drives taxi besides driving school bus. She says the taxi's good because when you run short of money between  pay cheques you can pick up cash for food by  driving cab. Another driver chimes in with  a story about how once she was so desperate for money that she took a job driving  around to the pubs selling costumes to the  strippers. She said she hated it.  When it comes to complaints, I am definitely out of my league at this coffee break.  Especially when you consider that none of  these women are complaining, they're just  trading stories.  If you think about these women one way,  they are the lucky ones. These are women  who've made it into a predominantly male  field and a predominantly male union. Some  of the women at work are licensed to drive  anything from the big rigs right down to  your sub compact. Though it says something right there, that a woman with a rig  licence would end up driving school bus.  I've met farm workers and garment workers who get up that early and work harder  and make less. If it comes to that, I know  farm wife who got up that early to organize  the milking of forty dairy cows and the feeding of sixteen children, along with the pigs  and the chickens and everything else and I  doubt she even has a social insurance number, because she's never had a job.  Over the last several years there's been  a growing awareness that in most countries  there are two separate economies operating.  These are usually referred to as the formal  economy, meaning regular jobs with regular pay cheques, tax, pension funds, holiday  pay, all a matter of public record and legislation. The informal economy is made up  of things like bartering, moonlighting, trading services, piece work or any of the illegal businesses like sweatshops and the drug  trade. For some women it will still be an  achievement to get their work into any economy where they will have access to money.  This is not good enough. I know this is  no surprise to anyone. None of this is a surprise, not how hard women work or how little we're paid. I think the thing that shook  me up and made me think about all this all  over again is that I got a glimpse of how  hard some of the women I'm working with  are working. We're all doing the same job  at the bus company, but that is the tip of  the iceberg. If all women's work were to  to the surface and become visible I bet we'd  find a lost continent.  Disabled organizer launches research study  Rawnie Dunn's study concerns low income families headed by a single disabled parent.  by Eunice Brooks  Rawnie Dunn is a person worth getting  to know. Yet, she is often hidden under  a forward tipping halo of blond hair. The  bowed head will be tending her young sons,  pouring over statistics, or sipping the ever-  present lemon tea.  Today Dunn is a sociologist. Her interest is in families where one or more members is disabled. Her focus is on mothers,  because since 1971 Dunn has suffered from  spinal cerebellar degeneration. Now she uses  a wheel chair for mobility.  And mobile Dunn is: a single parent,  holder of executive positions on several  boards of disabled groups for social change,  and she is working on her master's thesis  at Simon Fraser University. She's an honors student. Yet Dunn finds time to pen  vignettes on the frustrations of being disabled that have appeared in local publications. Irony is the meat in her stew.  However, the book/research project she  has just undertaken in conjunction with  DAWN BC (DisAbled Women's Network)  is serious stuff. Her concerns are for low income families with a single disabled parent. The idea to write a book came to her  when she was unable to find a book, or even  a paper on her topic, in the university library. There is no resource that could be  used to defend a disabled woman in family  court about to lose a child the authorities  think she cannot handle. Dunn thinks disabled mothers can cope, and she is going to  prove it.  Her research will consist of long initial  interviews with thirty women, with several  follow-up interviews spaced months apart.  Don't hold your breath waiting for publication, if you are in a situation of losing  a child. Publication will be in years rather  i than months. Still, it is comforting to know  i someone is working for disabled mothers. As  | her research becomes available, Dunn will  i make it public through DAWN BC. DAWN  is one of the groups of which she is a direc-  ' tor.  Last Mother's Day, Dunn organized a pic-  , nic for disabled moms and their kids, in  Stanley Park. It was a proud-faced media  event, with a better than expected turn out.  Late that night Dunn's two sons told a TV  audience that sometimes having a mother  in a wheelchair embarrasses them. They admitted that people laugh at her. "But we  say that she's just as normal as other mothers, only her legs don't work."  It says something for the upbringing of  boys who feel free to speak out about  heartache as personal as having their  mother laughed at.  Ask Dunn what it's like to have spinal  cerebellar degeneration and she'll reply:  "Well, it depends on the time of day. At 7:30  in the morning, it seems like I've spent all  my life getting the kids ready for school."  She goes on to describe scenes every mother  can relate to.  However there is one difference. Five  years ago, when Dunn had to take her boys  to daycare, the facility was inaccessible to  wheelchairs. She had to wait at the foot of  the steps outside so the supervisor could  bring out the "Sign In" book. There are  other places Dunn would like to go, but her  wheelchair can't—the Women's Bookstore  is just one example. Crab Park is another.  Buildings that don't provide gently sloped  ramps and large comfort stations with grab  bars, might as well advertise that the disabled, like Dunn, are unwelcome.  Dunn doesn't consider herself confined to  a wheelchair, in fact the phrase is one of annoyance to her. She says: "Wheelchairs are  simply tools that can be used by the mobility impaired." Careful observation of the  woman, Rawnie Dunn, gives one the idea  that she doesn't consider herself confined to  anything.  Wave a challenge in front of her, and  Dunn will accept it or turn it down.  Whichever, the choices are hers. She stares  into the lemon tea as though it was a crystal  ball, then the head comes up, and the fall of  hair is tossed out of her way. That's an ideal  time for you to get out of her way too, because Dunn doesn't let much stop her once  she decides where to go.  ^  ^5v V  \\  FEMINISM"  BY Vec M^kay • Dome.

CANADA - V5M 5L-3  KINESIS   8 Arts  Hazel Dickens:  Hazel Dickens at the 1987 Vancouver Folk Music Festival  a tradition of  heartfelt music  by Isis  Encircled by interviewers at the 1987  Vancouver Folk Music Festival, including  Kinesis, Hazel Dickens explains, in her  down to earth, direct way, what she believes.  Dickens has been singing and performing  hillbilly music for years, and considers herself a music traditionalist. She plays the old  songs that celebrate people's fights and victories, and she makes new songs that reflect  what is happening today.  She speaks to us softly, she is greatly outnumbered by interviewers, and she has answered most of these questions many, many  times before. Yet she gives the impression  that she really is talking with each of us,  speaking from her heart.  Things are still in a sad place, when anybody votes for Ronald Reagan or takes Ollie  North as a national hero. We need heroes,  but we don't need that kind. We need a revolutionary, working class hero," she explains  with conviction.  Although she would not take on that definition of herself, there is no doubt that Dickens is just such a hero.

It was  an integral part of everyday life, and as the  eighth out of eleven children, she always had  someone she could sing with. People would  sit out on their front porches and make music. "It was just something you had—like  cows in the pasture."  Beckoned by the rumours of the good life,  she moved to Baltimore in search of work  around 1950. The city was not everything  she imagined, and hillbillies like Dickens and  her family struggled to find an identity in a  culture that made no place for them. In the  country, music made things easier and drew  people together, and the same thing happened in the city. Not only hillbillies, but to  Dickens' surprise, some city people became  interested. "I had never met city people before. We did a lot of living and learning together. That was the beginning."  The whole city experience was an awakening for Dickens, who had been raised in  a church rigid with black and white definitions. She began looking for good message  songs, to write about real things and real  people, about looking for ways to live with  other people, ordinary people. "I do better  if I stay close to the earth and close to the  things that I know about."  Over the course of her life, she has  seen a lot of political changes, and the  women's movement was the first that came  to her mind when questioned about these.  "Women have a lot more say in a lot of  things that we used to, in all areas."  She was especially impressed to be at the  Vancouver Folk Festival in the company of  so many other fine women musicians. This  would not have happened ten years ago.  But women have made tremendous progress  everywhere. "I think it's time for a president," she states laughingly, but to her it is  no joke. When several interviewers at once  snort about Maggie Thatcher, Dickens readily concedes this is not what she had in  mind.  The women's movement has touched  Dickens personally. "Being around women is  extremely helpful and stimulating. It gives  me courage." Growing up she didn't have  much support from other women, but the  women's movement has helped her find the  voice to sing songs she used to keep hidden.  She is supportive of the women's movement, although she seems to feel some distance. Identifying as a traditionalist performer, some of her feelings of distance derive from troubles she has had being accepted and welcomed as such. And unpleasant encounters with separatists have made  her feel left out, but she does emphasize that  although these incidents were very unpleas  ant, they haven't been many in number. "I  definitely feel the support from the women's  movement, and I definitely want to support  them."  A major complaint is that traditionalist women, such as Dickens, are often  not included or adequately represented in  women's music events. These women are  the roots of contemporary women's music, although many of us might not recognize their names: women such as Florence  Reece who lived through the 1931 Harlan County coal mining strike when company gun thugs terrorized the countryside.  Reece wrote "Which Side Are You On,"  the famous union rallying call, still popular at demonstrations and pickets today.  Sarah Organ Gunning, Aunt Molly Jackson, Frankie Armstrong, Jean Ritchie, Alice Gerard and Rosalie Sorrels are only a  few others. Listen to our predecessors, the  traditionalists, many are still active. We can  gain a sense of how far we've come, how long  the struggle is, and how powerful we are.  "If you don't know what you came from,  the people who first ploughed the earth,  you're not going to have a good harvest. We  need to know the people who fought and  died for us, and it'll give us strength, and we  need it. God knows we need all we can get."  Making a living as a traditionalist and a  performer with a social conscience is even  more difficult in mass culture. Musicians  have to balance what they are saying with  trying to earn a living. It becomes a toss-up  between poverty and saying what you want,  or making a lot of money. "It's a pretty big  commitment because you do have all kinds  of offers and people who want to take what  you have and make it into a more commercial music."  This is not the only thing that Dickens  has had to consider. When she began playing in public she felt like she was exploiting  the music by using it in a political way. She  eventually realized that the music's message, what it said to people, was what the  music was about. Music is a powerful way  for people to derive strength and a sense of  unity. Music for music's sake alone is not  what it's all about for Dickens.  "At first I was very much against using  the music as a bridge between me and other  people, or in a political way. I was a real  purist and thought I was exploiting the music and people and I didn't want to do that.  I began later to see that it was a service. I  feel very good these days. I wouldn't put a  song on a record just to fill up space. You'  cheating people if you do that. There's so  many good songs and so many things to talk  about in songs, poetry, books, that it's an  insult to people not to say it."  KINESIS Arts  /////////////////////////^^^^^  Potpourri of music news  by Connie Kuhns  I'm not a fan of Dolly Parton, Linda Ron-  stadt and Emmy Lou Harris' recent collaboration, Trio. This record was in the works  for ten years, which is quite a build up for  such a disappointment. None of the women  particularly stand out, and certainly Dolly's  talents are down played in order to keep everything nice and soft and even. Such potential. Such a boring record. Also, I've never  been able to forgive Linda Ronstadt for  her pathetic stand (or non-stand) on South  Africa. For that reason alone, I can't recommend this album.  I'm afraid I must also be the dissenting  voice on the subject of Michelle Shocked. After playing her record The Texas Camp-  fire Tapes several times on my radio show,  and after seeing her at the Vancouver Folk  Music Festival, it looks to me like she's a  victim of her own publicity.  Michelle has a sweet voice, but there is  nothing particularly interesting about her  performing style or her songwriting. In fact,  her songs remind me of someone who just  discovered there were oppressed people in  the world, but only because she drove by  some on her way to work, or read a newspaper article. She is too far removed from  her subject matter to make me really care.  However the hype surrounding her first  album release is quite incredible, including  record company promo that compares her  to early Dylan. Michelle should have been  allowed to develop an image which is more  suited to who she really is. Comparing her  to one of the best so early in her career just  sets her up for tough criticism. Subliminally,  DUQ  GUMDABARRANCQ  SALVADOR BUSTOS  Salvador and Kalia Cardenal, the brother  and sister known as Guardabarranco; and  Salvador Bustos, are the best-known  proponents of "Volcanto", the Nicaraguan  version of the Latin American New Song  or"Nueva Cancion" movement.

I think every record company in the industrialized world is looking for another Ferron. They just can't find one.  (Michelle will be appearing at the Commodore in Vancouver on November 8, with  label-mates and first rate musicians, the  Oyster Band.)  On the A side, the Minneapolis band  Tetes Noires has released an outstanding  second album, Clay Foot Gods. Their first  album was on their own label Rapunzel  Records, but Rounder Records has picked  up their cause. They're a very original band  wjth sharp lyrics, which you can understand. Their song "Dear Jane" is one of the  best I've heard this year.  Also on the turntable is Ellen Mcllwaine's  eighth album Looking for Trouble. This  woman is an unbelievable talent. After interviewing her for the second time last  month, and seeing her shows in Vancouver  and Winnipeg, I can't believe she walks  around and eats and sleeps like ordinary  people. She is authentic rock and roll; a  groundbreaker who is still breaking ground.  Buy anything with her name on it.  Last words: former Go-Go Belinda Carlisle and Dolly Parton are planning a duet;  an all female band Wanda and the Way It Is  "3 have released a debut single "We've Got the  J: Feeling"; a Boston-based band, Mata Hari,  ~ has completed a 5-song master produced by  ^ Genya Ravan; and Vancouver's Elizabeth  g Fischer has a new Animal Slaves.  ^     In other music news, I will be writing a  * column for Chicago's Hot  Wire magazine  o called Live! From Canada. The column is  o. being described as an introduction to the  women's music movement in Canada. Please  keep me informed as to what you or your  group is doing so your movement can be  chronicled. My first article, which will appear in the November issue, is on Heather  Bishop.  Heather is currently on tour in the United  States with dates in Boston and surrounding area, Durham, N.C., Ann Arbor, and  California. Her recent album A Taste of  the Blues is Midwest Music's number five  top seller, and Lucie Blue Tremblay's debut album is number six for Ladyslipper  Records. Heather was nominated for a Juno  for most promising female vocalist, and Lu-  • cie's album was nominated by the Boston  Globe as one of their ten best albums of the  year. Teresa Trull's A Step Away was also  on the list. Teresa won outstanding recording artist at the San Francisco Cable Car  Awards where she was also nominated for  entertainer of the year.  Redwood Records celebrated its fifteenth  anniversary while Redwood founder Holly  Near was honored by the San Francisco  Women's Foundation for her outstanding  achievements in music. Holly, Linda Tillery  and Meg Christian won the California  Women for Understanding Lesbian Rights  Award.  Sweet Honey in the Rock won in the  women's music category at the National Association of Independent Record Distributors Awards; Sue Fink received honorable  mention. Casselberry-Dupree were nominated for best reggae album and best album  design.  June Millington is involved in the founding of The Institute for the Musical Arts, an  organization whose primary goal is to help  women, especially women of colour, pursue  careers in a variety of musical fields.

West Word Three: expanding success  West Word Three, Women and Words'  third annual Summer School/Retreat for  Women, was held last August in Vancouver.  West Word Three expanded the scope of  previous years by adding a new workshop—  Creative Documentary. Enrollment for the  school was up to thirty-two, in contrast to  twenty for West Word Two.  The school was designed to give the students intensive daily instruction as well as a  large amount of free time in which to write  and reflect upon their positions as women  writers. Each day classes ran from 9:30 to  noon, with the afternoons available for the  instructors to meet with individual students  for consultation and critiques. There were  two evenings of student readings; all of the  students elected to read their work to the  rest of the school which they generally found  a productive and exhilarating experience.  Students with diverse literary backgrounds came from Newfoundland, P.E.I.,  Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Many of the  women had previously published their work  or were involved in writing or publishing organizations; others had experience  with workshops or post-secondary schooling. This diversity contributed to a positive  and stimulating environment for young and  unpublished writers, as well as those women  who have limited contact with writing communities. All twenty of the students who required scholarships in order to attend received them.  The instructors were as follows: Nicole  Brossard, fiction/theory, Margaret Hollings-  worth, playwriting; Myrna Kostash, creative documentary; Betsy Warland, poetry.  Brossard has been a key figure in the development of women's writing in Quebec.  Known primarily as a poet, she has also  published seven books of prose. Her recent  collection of theoretical writing La Let-  tre Aerienne, will soon be available from  Women's Press.  Hollingsworth, from Toronto, has been  writing plays for fifteen years; several of  her plays have been produced and others  have been nominated for various awards. A  collection of short stories, Smiling Under  Water, will be released later this year.  Kotash, from Edmonton, has contributed  to several magazines and anthologies and  has written documentary film scripts for the  NFB and CBC. Adding to her two other  books, No Kidding: Inside the Life of  Teenage Girls was released during her stay  at West Word.  Warland, a Vancouver poet, has published two books and has two forthcoming  in 1988. She is also an editor of (f.)lip, a  new feminist literary quarterly.  Also contributing to West Word were two  guest readers: B.C. writers Jeanette Armstrong and Sharon Thesen. Their readings  were a part of a number of public events  which ran the duration of West Word. A  new public event was added this year: a  panel discussion given by the instructors  and moderated by Sandy Duncan. The subject is reflected clearly in the title: "Leaps  and Boundaries: Where the Genres Cross."  The instructors and students provided  insightful and generous evaluation remarks  about both the school's structure and content, as well as reflections on their experiences.  According to one instructor, "Both instructors and students are intensely involved in creating a provocative, yet safe,  learning environment: the risks that are  taken and the breakthroughs that are made  are exhilarating! This is the heart of a  woman-centred school."  KINESIS   87 No Kelley. the publisher of Gal-  believes women have been ex-  i from the arts establishment.  Gallerie:  New arts annual to showcase women  by Agatha Cinader  Gallerie is the name of a soft-bound  book of womens' art that Caffyn Kelley, a  Vancouver artist, hopes to publish annually,  beginning in June 1988, if she can raise the  $30,000 it will cost to produce the first issue.  The book would include photographs representing an integrated body of work by  each of at least forty women artists from  Canada and the United States. In an accom-  *   panying text the artist would describe what  her art means to her, how she produces it,  L    how it fits in with her work, her life etc.  In addition to this gallery of work, other  »    articles  would deal  more  generally  with  I   what Kelley calls "women's culture." For in-  I   stance, an article might compare the way in  I   which women's art is shown and distributed  by the mainstream art world with alternative systems generated by women's organizations for showing and distributing art.  Finally, Gallerie would include announcements of events of possible interest  to women artists and advertisements from  various women's groups, including, for example, book publishers and distributors.  Kelley sees Gallerie as a place for women  artists, whether or not they are professional  artists, to learn about one another's work, a  place where they can make their own meanings, define art without reference to the art  world establishment of galleries, critics, academics ... For as Kelley points out, women  have been and continue to be excluded from  that art establishment.  "In the 1970's, women started to make  a lot of noise about being excluded from  the art world and a lot of major work  by women artists started to be shown ...  and a lot of texts were written by women  about women's art ... but that all came  to a screeching half ... the 80's has been  a decade where those gains have been withdrawn to some extent ... There has been  a trend away from the forms of art that  women had made special and popular, using  handicrafts, using vaginal images, all those  things suddenly became passe ..."  Women's concerns and their artistic expressions of these concerns have often not  been considered valid by the art world.  Women have also had trouble finding the  time and money to support themselves as  artists. As Kelley says:  "A lot of women are never going to make  it as art world professionals, not only because they are excluded by prejudice from  the top-paying jobs in the art world but  because they don't have the money to set  themselves up as artists ... Yet they're do-  ARIEL BOOKS  open  Monday to Saturday  10-6  Sunday  1-5  arid books for women  2766\v.4thave. van.,b.c. 733-35U  ing important work and meaningful work  and want to share it with other women and  want to know what other women are doing."  The women who show their work in  Gallerie need not be professional artists.  Work would be considered in any medium  that can be communicated photographically. And each woman would tell her own  story of what her art means to her and how  it fits in with the rest of her life.  Kelley describes how the idea for Gallerie developed from her experiences as an  artist and printer. After she graduated from  Simon Fraser University, Kelley took some  courses in photography and printmaking  and began to make art, while earning a living as a graphic designer. During this period she started to meet other women who  shared a similar understanding of the world:  she became a feminist. She was attracted to  printing because it provided a way to share  ideas with a lot of people.  "... I thought, wouldn't it be great to  be able to produce in mass the things that  make the world make sense to me." But as  an estimator and purchasing manager for a  commercial printer she found she was doing  flyers for Safeway, worrying about "whether  or not 150 envelopes cost seven cents or two  cents each and all these things that don't  really matter much."  The idea to produce a magazine of  women's art had been in the back of her  mind for some time and now her life has become organized in a way that makes it possible for her to pursue this dream. She now  works part time for a good salary so she  has time to work on Gallerie and she has  a supportive relationship with her partner,  Marnie, with whom she shares a house nestled in a bay of Indian Arm.  Gallerie is an expensive project. Kelley  estimates that it will cost about $30,000 to  produce the first annual. She is relying on  early subscriptions to raise that money. To  encourage people to make a commitment to  Gallerie now, she is offering the first issue  to people who order before December 1 for  $6.00 (fifty percent of the list price). At $6  per copy, she must sell 5000 subscriptions  to meet her costs.  Gallerie is an ambitious and interesting  project. If it succeeds it will be one of the  few magazines of its kind in North America. You can help it to succeed by ordering  your copy now.

I was not present at that  conference, but I heard that white Western  women stopped complaining about their jet  lag when they realized that some of the then-  African sisters had walked for eight days to  meet them.  The second explosion of the women's consciousness happened in Moscow in June of  this year, 1987. It was the conference called,  "Towards the Year 2000 Without Nuclear  Weapons, for Peace, Equality and Justice,"  and was attended by nearly 3,000 women  from over 154 countries.  Mikhail Gorbechev addressed the conference in the opening session, and said something very interesting about women. He  made reference to an old saying that suggested that the three main things in life of  most value are: daily bread that gives us  sustenance, books that give us wisdom, and  women that prevent the thread of life from  being broken.  The idea of women holding the thread of  life stayed with me constantly over the next  six days. Six days of festival and song and  women talk. Women talk about peace, and  the need to identify solutions rather than redefining problems. Women groping to hold  fast the thread of life.  After my return to Canada I had to grapple with the idea that women are more inherently responsible for life than men are,  because, in this era of genetic engineering,  the subject is highly debatable. However, I  have a deep respect for old wisdom, and  dredged a memory from a book read long  ago that said during World War Two, European women reverted en masse to breast  feeding when bottled, powdered, and tinned  milk was unavailable. A whole generation  of children was kept alive by these women.  Children kept alive by women, continuing  the thread of life.  If we women hold the thread of life, as I  now believe we do, than we need to come up  with some other explanation for the preponderance of our gender in the peace movement than the one currently in vogue, i.e.  that we are more loving and caring than  men. Not only is thb assumption questionable, it is also a put down of both sexes and  implies women are capable of little else.  I would suggest instead that because we  hold the thread of life we are absolutely  more intent on finding the way to preserve  it, and happen quite simply to be using very  womanish skills to do so.  For instance, women are notoriously curious. Those of them who have passed  through the grieving stage which is inevitable when the reality of the dying planet  is confronted, have begun to explore what it  is that is eating away at the roots of life, and  discovered a ghastly can of worms, something that many of them never knew even  existed. They have taken the lid off this can  of worms, taken a look, and realized with a  sinking heart and rising spirit that they will  never be able to replace that lid, and they  are also using another long practiced skill,  communication, to pass on what they have  discovered to other curious women.  Women's communication is unique to  their sex. It not only shares feelings which  is vital at all times, but has the element of  gossip intrinsic to it.  The word gossip is also a put down for  women, but the Oxford dictionary defini  tion includes "friend, especially of women  ... easy unconstrained talk or writing especially about persons or social events" and  signifies for politicised women talking about  things we are not supposed to talk about,  and wanting to know things we are not supposed to know.  They want to know if the international  Mafia is linked to N.A.T.O. They want to  know who the United States is really protecting in the Persian Gulf. They want to  know if their elected representatives are  only school prefects. No matter how bad it  is, women now want to know everything.  Beyond this knowing aspect, women  are doing more. They are intuitively making connections. Some people call this  right brain thinking, people who put down  women call it leaping to conclusions.  Whatever it is called, women are indeed  making leaps, and great progressive leaps at  that. Of course this is somewhat scary, especially to white, middle class women for  whom this type of leaping is relatively new.  They are also unavoidable leaps when faced  with the hurdle of facts they now know, and  are the same leaps that have been and are  being made by the world's hungry and oppressed because they are survival leaps pure  and simple, and must be made by all of us  if the thread of life is to continue.  Two illustrations of the connections that  are being made (and not being made) arrived in my mail last week in the form of  two very different newsletters from activists  in the United States.  The first, by a group not making leaps,  was from a Central American support and  refugee camp in the southern states, staffed  by an extremely fine group of people, Judeo  Christian pacifists. On the front cover of  their newsletter there was a picture of an  adult white American worker at the camp  gently helping a small Nicaraguan child  to hobble on a wooden leg. This is their  new project; making prosthesis for Central  American children whose legs have been  blown off by North American bombs. The  group is doing caring, decent work, as the  children do need the limbs.  The second newsletter was from an all  women's peace group which had two articles  on the front page. One about poverty in the  U.S. and the other about racism in the U.S.  What is the difference? Why would I see  the first group as not making the leap while  the second has?  The difference is that the women in the  second group have learned something basic  from the war in Nicaragua, and are working to ensure that future Nicaraguan children will be able to keep their own brown,  running, leaping legs.  These women know that their country's  weapons, conventional and nuclear, are to  protect the riches of this abundant planet  for the wealthy, and they know that the  weapons are directed at the poor of the  world and those that defend justice. They  know that our economic system has to  change, and they know that to say anything  less and to work for anything less is a betrayal of the thread of life.  They know there is no short way to  peace, although we could perhaps look for  magic to give us time to do it in. I am proud  to be these women's sister, and profoundly  grateful that women hold up more than half  the sky.  //////////////////^^^^^  ////////////////////^^^^^  LETTERS  More lesbian  publishers  Kinesis  We heartily congratulate and encourage  you, the staff and volunteers of Kinesis, to  continue providing an excellent source of information for women and offering a forum  for the exchange of ideas and experiences.  With reference to Agatha Cinader's article on Ragweed Press in the September  87 issue, we want to let women know that  Lilith Publications decided early this spring  to narrow its focus to publications on lesbian and strong women-identified books.  As we understand it, Impertinent Press  of Calgary is also preparing to launch books  by lesbians.  Lilith's first lesbian book is entitled "Secrets of the Invisible World" by Saskatchewan writer Jean Roberta, available at  Canada's feminist bookstores.  Also scheduled for spring 1988 is the  "Lesbian Guide to Gracious Living" (sub  missions are welcome).  Women's presses in Canada are coming  out, so to speak, and we think it's great  that lesbian writers and readers at last have  three Canadian presses to turn to for their  literary needs.  Yours,  Adena Franz, Publisher, Lilith Publications  Inc., 2191 Clifton Ave., Montreal, Quebec,  H4A 2N5  IWD organizers  take note  Kinesis  We (the Women's Rights Committee of  the B.C. Federation of Labour) are planning a conference on Pay Equity for International Women's Day, (IWD) which will  be open to participants from the women's  movement, the New Democratic Party and  trade unions supporting the Bill 19 boycott.  We are hoping to bring at least 200 to  the IWD rally and have planned our confer  ence agenda based on the earlier rally start  of last year.  International Women's Day falls midweek in 1988 and so there are two weekends which could be used for the rally. Because we had to book conference facilities  some time ago, we have booked the Robson Square Media Centre for the weekend  of Friday evening March 11, and Saturday,  March 12.  We hope this will fit in with the plans  of the 1988 IWD and we have elected Kate  Braid and Astrid Davidson to act as alternate delegates to the committee when it is  set up.  We would very much like to build a coali  tion of women's groups around the issue of  Pay Equity as done in Ontario and our Saturday morning speaker will talk about the  Ontario coalition.  We really hope we can all get together on  Pay Equity the way we have on IWD day  the last two years.  Yours in sisterhood,  Anne Harvey, V/P B.C. Fed, on behalf of  Women's Rights Committee, B.C.
