After  more than four years of legislative review, Bill C-127  (formerly C-53) passed third  reading on August 4.  The federal bill contained  eleventh hour amendments which  were presented to the house at  6:25 p.m. and passed within an  hour. Women's organizations  were asked to support changes  they hadn't even seen!  Was August 4 truly a "great  day for Canadian women" as  Therese Killens, Parliamentary  Secretary to the I inister of  State responsible for the  Status of Women, told the House  of Commons? Reaction from  women's groups has ranged from  "a great victory for women"  (the Canadian Advisory Council  on the Status of Women) to some  improvement is better than no  change, to "overall a step  backward for women" (Toronto  Area Caucus of Women and the  Law).  Will the new laws improve legal protection for women and  will they result in more  charges and convictions in  sexual assault cases? While  the new Bill includes some  improvements, key provisions  are fatally flawed. Three  critical weaknesses are: the  defence of 'honest belief(S.  244-4); the introduction of the  victim's prior sexual activity  (S.246.6-1); and the structure  and definition of 'sexual  assault' (SS 246.2-,246.3 and  246.4).  The 'honest belief defence  comes from the contentious  1980 decision of the Supreme  Court of Canada in R. v.  Pappajonn. The accused can be  aquitted if he establishes he  honestly believed the victim  consented, even though, in  fact, she did not. This belief  does not have to be reasonable;  the presence or absence of  reasonable grounds is only one  factor ta be considered in  determining the honesty of the  accused's belief.  Some women think it would be  sufficient to require the  accused to establish reasonable  grounds for his 'honest belief  G iven the prevailing sexist  myths regarding women's sexuality, it is unlikely the legal  system would interpret such  grounds in a manner acceptable  Van. East picket  halts porn line-up  A group of Vancouver women and  men have discovered that it is  possible to fight pornography  — and win.  When the August-October issue  of Vancouver East Cinema's  schedule was distributed, it  was clear that a new gimmick  was being tried—the showing  of pornographic films in the  fri day and Saturday 11:30 pm  time slot. The films included  such offerings as Playmates  in 3-D  (free glasses supplied)  and The Devil in Miss Jones  (a movie in which a woman's  suicide is used for so-called  "erotic" effect).  Although a significant number  of women were angered by the  Van East Cinema's apparent  change in policy, two Vancouver women decided to do something about it and spent the  two days prior to the first  scheduled show calling women's organizations and individuals to organize a picket  on August 4-  Several women leafletted earlier film showings that evening, encouraging movie-goers  to boycott the theatre. At  10:30 pm, more than 50 women  and men picketted the theatre  with signs such as "Porn pays  Van East's mortgage".  By 10:45 it was all over. The  majority of the group reject  ed an initial proposal that  future showings would be cancelled if they would allow  the first screening to proceed. Rnally, the theatre  management agreed to cancel  all scheduled pornographic  films.  Manager AI Patel said of the  decision to stop the screenings, "It's a community theatre and without the feedback  of the people we don't know  how they will respond to our  films. This is very good feedback we got today."  "If I've lost a bundle (of  money) for the community's  sake, fine." The fact that  the protesters compose a significant proportion of the  Van East's clientele undoubtedly affected the decision to  cancel porn at the theatre.  Rirthermore, since the picket-  ers greatly outnumbered the  pornography seekers, the implications for the theatre  were difficult- to ignore.  Nevertheless, in a time when  pornography in Vancouver is  growing rapidly, such a victory is significant. Our  thanks should go to the two  women who responded so quickly, to all those who came out  to the picket, and to the Van  East management for listening  to our response.  by Debra Lewis  Women attending 'Letter Lobby Night' at the North Shore Women's  Centre brought their pens, their paper and their rage. Although  letters were sent to several MPS and MLAs regarding charges levelled at Red Hot Video, the main focus of the effort was B.C.  Attorney General Allan Williams. The women were demanding he  take immediate action on the issue, as well as a meeting, which  Williams has avoided to date.  to feminists.  The availability of this  defence could completely undermine the abolition of spousal  immunity in sexual assault  cases. Also, the use of this  defence, previously unavailable  in assault cases, has serious  consequences for battered  women. For example, a husband  might argue that when he had  beaten his wife in the past,  "we made love afterwards", and  that led him to believe she  consented to the assault.  The government claims the  admissability of the victim's  previous sexual history with  others than the accused has  been significantly restricted.  The last time the law in this  area was amended, women were  given the same assurances but  the result was that the situation worsened.  Section 246.6(1) permits the  introduction of the victim's  prior sexual history to rebut  evidence led by the prosecution,prove the identity of the  accused or in a case where the  other sexual activity took  place on the same occasion (eg  gang rape). This last section  is particularly open to abuse.  The prior sexual history of the  complainant with others than  the accused should be inadmis-  sable under all circumstances.  Anything less undermines the  fact that 'NO' means 'NO'.  Changing the name of the offence  from 'rape' to 'sexual assault'  is a significant but insufficient reform since there is no  definition of 'sexual assault'  in the Bill. Some women believe  this is a progressive step  that will permit judges to  interpret the offence "as they  best determine in the widest,  descriptive way." The appointment of more women to the  judiciary is seen as a way to  ensure that the definition is  developed in the best interests  of the victims. Can women afford  to wait for the time when there  are enough feminist judges to  control the determination of  the sexual assault definition?  Since the Criminal Code is a  code, used to define crimes, a  definition is essential. The  absence of a deginition will  lead to confusion and ambiguity  and places too much discretion  in the hands of police and the  Crown. The government has said  the first level of sexual  assault will cover everything  from "touching to forced  intercourse with a minimum of  violence." Without a definition,  behaviours such as grabbing a  woman's thigh might not lead to  a charge of sexual assault.  The problem is compounded by  the fact that the first tier of  sexual assault is a hybrid  offence. There is a great difference in the penalities for  a summary conviction offence  and an indictable offence - up  to six months as opposed to a  ten year maximum. At what point  in the continuum of behaviours  from "touching to forced sexual  intercourse" will the distinction be made between indictable  and summary offences?  This overhaul of the Criminal  Code also provided a missed  opportunity to include some  provisions for cases of sexual  harassment and improvement of  the sentencing system in cases  of assault to provide better  protection for battered women.  Other areas of concern in Bill  C-127 include the amendment to  the Divorce Act, the abrogation  of the doctrine of recent complaint, the implications of the  definition of bodily harm for  battered women, and the impact  of the new child abduction  sections. The statement by  John J amble (P.C. York North)  that "a fraud has been perpetrated on the female population  of this country" has a disturbing echo.  by Hilarie McMurrary 2   Kinesis   September 1982  MOVEMENT MATTERS  VSW's general meeting  brings in new exec  The Annual General Meeting of the Vancouver  Status of Women was held on July 15th at  7:30.

September 1982   Kinesis   3  LABOUR  Wage control program attacks  workers rights  by Marion Pollack  The recently introduced wage control programs will not reduce inflation as federal and provincial politicians suggest. In  reality they will undermine workers rights  and the ability of all working people to  deal with the effects of inflation. Women  are doubly affected.  The provincial government's Compensation  Stabilization Programme (CSP) limits public sector wage increases to a maximum of  10$ for a two year period. In addition it  places a maximum 10$ limit on health,  education, municipal, and social service  spending.  Bill C124, recently passed by the federal  parliament, limits all federal public  workers to a maximum wage increase of 6?  and 5? over a two year period. It severely curtails collective bargaining rights  and elminiates the right to strike.  Because women already earn approximately  60? of a man's wage, this six percent  limit will only increase the gap. For  example, if a woman earns $6.00 per hour  and a man $10.00, the gap is $4-00 per  hour. A 6? wage increase means that the  woman would receive $6.36 and the man  $10.60. The gap grows by 24s^ to $4.24 per  hour.  Wage controls are also an effective way  to stop the fight for equal pay for work  of equal value. In the past number of  years there has been an upsurge in women  demanding pay equity, but wage controls  are certain to increase the existing inequality between men and women workers.  At U.B.C. for example, the average entry  level for men's jobs (light labourer,  kiosk attendant, etc. ) are paid at $1652  per month. Entry level clerical jobs (for  women) are paid at $1130 per month. Equalization requires a 46? wage increase at  this level. Clearly the wage control program blocks fair pay for women.  Moreover, wage controls weaken the overall position of women in the workforce.  Across B.C. large numbers of workers have  been laid off as a direct consequence of  this programme. The B.C. Health Association has released figures indicating that  budget cutbacks have been responsible for  the laying off of more than 2,000 hospital  workers. The vast majority are women  workers.  Wage controls mean that it will be in the  employers interest to hire more part time  and temporary workers. For example, temporary workers working for both the municipal and provincial governments receive  substantially less benefits than full time  workers. This means that they are cheaper  to employ than regular full-timers. In  addition, since most of the part-time and  temporary workers have little or no job  security they can be used according to  the whim of the employer. Since women make  up the vast pool of workers in this category, wage controls can only mean less  economic security for women.  Poor wages are not the only item contributing to women's inequality in the workforce. Lack of paid maternity leave benefits, childcare subsidies, and fair pensions also contribute to this inequity.  The wage control programs count all these  kinds of benefits as wages. This forces  women workers into making an unreal choice  between maternity leave benefits and wage  increases.  Last year the bulk of newly created jobs  in B.C. were in the public sector and  they went to women returning to the workforce after a period of absence. Spending  limits in the public sector means that  these jobs will not be created.  Health and safety items are becoming of  increasing concern to working women. E>r  example, protection against the health  hazards of Video Display Terminals (TDT's)  is of top priority for many workers and  their unions. This type of protection  costs money. Provincially, the government  will try to trade these protections off  against a wage increase, federally, due  to the suspension of collective bargaining  rights, unions can't even begin to negotiate these items.  In B.C. the government is demanding that  workers give up their hard fought for  wage increases in return for job security.  The teachers' union is being threatened  with massive layoffs unless they agree to  a wage cut. If the union says no to these  give-aways or concessions, 3,000 teachers  will face layoffs, the majority of whom  will be women.  The wage control program is a direct attack on our right to bargain collectively.  In B.C., several of the largest unions,  with a high proportion of women members,  were on the verge of bargaining for new  contracts when wage controls were introduced. These include the Hospital Employees Ihion, the B.CG.E.U. and the Nurses.  The government's timing in introducing  these controls says they are not out to  "Wff¬Æ  smash inflation but to smash unions,  federally, the picture is even clearer.  Bill C-124 allows virtually no collective  bargining rights. Wage controls are union  busting 1980's style.  Wages do not cause inflation. Since 1976  wage increases for all workers have increased by less than 10? per annum. Yet,  prices over that period went up by an  average of 10? annually. The incomes of  most working people, after taking into  account inflation, are now 10? less than  what they were in 1976. Bank profits and  interest rates have more than doubled in  the past several years, and in 1981 the  Bank of Nova Scotia's profit increased  by over 35?. The ever increasing desire  for profits combined with the totally  unplanned nature of the economy is what  causes inflation.  Wage controls are an attempt to take away  the gains women have made in the past decade. These were not made by polite begging, silence, or tea parties. They were  made by women everywhere fighting for our  rights. It is imperative that, unless we  want to return to the most undesirable  aspects of decades past, we fight back,..^  BCGEU contract demands  address problems of women  About one half of the 50,000 member B.C.  Government Employees Union (BCGEU) are  women. In a special bargaining convention  earlier this summer, contract demands  were established that attempt ending workplace discrimination for government employees.  The Union is proposing a three-part plan  meant to gradually overcome the current  wage discrimination for male and female  jobs. The proposal would reduce all salary ranges to four steps by dropping the  lower steps, reduce the time period required to earn an increment from one year  to six months, and raise all salary ranges  in the bargaining unit that fall below  "1,386-$1,529 to that amount before  across-the-board adjustments are made.  Other new proposals include improved maternity leave provisions, reimbursement of  costs for child care expenses when employees are required to be away from home  on business or for employer-related educational purposes that occur outside of  regular shifts, and the establishment of  pilot project childcare centres.  In keeping with sexual harassment protection clauses negotiated into other BCGEU  agreements, there is a Union demand recognizing "the right of employees to work in  an environment free from sexual harassment". The clause includes a detailed  definition of sexual harassment, and establishes a confidential grievance procedure.  The Union has also proposed a clause dealing with Video Display Terminals and comparable equipment. The 14-section clause  calls for mandatory eye examinations, rest  breaks each hour during continuous VDT  operation, testing of equipment for radiation emissions, proper lighting and equipment adjustment to the individual, the  option of relocation without loss of pay  for pregnant operators and the monitoring  of VDT-related medical statistics.  Colleen Fitzpatrick, Sisterhood 4   Kinesis   September 1982  ON CAMPUS  Poco women fight Douglas cuts  A campaign spearheaded by the Port Coquitlam Area Women's Centre may be able to  help reverse Douglas College's decision  to axe its Women's Studies program.  The program at Douglas College became a  victim of province-wide post-secondary  financial cutbacks earlier this year  when college principal Bill Day announced  that the college's operating budget for  the coming year was $12.3 million—$1.4  million less than expected. Day has  stated that the decision to cut women's  studies would be least damaging to Douglas College in the long run.  As a result, Margaretha Hoek's position  as department head was declared "redundant". An additional 20 part-time faculty members will be laid off. A reduced  number of courses will commence this fall  without a co-ordinator to oversee the  program—all of this amounting to a gradual withdrawal of services for more than  500 women.  The response from the women's community  was immediate. Douglas College received  Fewer female profs  female university lecturers and professors in Canada are more scarce today than  they were 50 years ago.  Susan Jackel, a lecturer in Canadian  Studies at the Thiversity of Alberta,  said in 1931, 19? of full-time university  academics in Canada were feamle. Today,  the figure has dropped to 14%.  Jackel is part of a study group looking  at the status of women scholars.  Canadian Press  a barrage of letters protesting the move,  and a delegation of women went before the  college's July 8th Board meeting demanding the rationale for the attack on women's  studies.  The Board decided that an ad hoc committee should be struck to examine other alternatives. A task force made up of Board  members and representatives from the Port  Coquitlam Area Women's Centre will meet  on September 15.  Jana Taylor, one of the delegates, blames  a male-dominated administration for Douglas College's initial decision, saying  that eliminating women's studies will be  a step backwards for Douglas since 66?  of the student population is female.  Meanwhile, the Director of Continuing'  Education at Kwantlen College, Surrey  Campus, reports that budget cutbacks have  had a minimal effect on women's studies  there. Susan Witter said that almost all  of the 50 or so non-credit and one credit  (English) course will continue as usual,  but women's access co-ordinator Janet  Patterson will work on a half-time basis.  financial restraints have not yet taken  a toll on women's studies at IBC where  its meagre offering of four core courses  and a few related ones will go on as  before.  However, the situation is quite different  at S FU where a thriving women's studies  program may be able to offer anM.A.  program in 1983. Presently, students can  minor in women's studies; five to seven  courses are held each semester.  Women's Co-ordinator "Veronica Strong-  Boag credited the healthy state of the  S FU program to a supportive administration and dean, consistent enrollment, and  tenured instructors.  "The people who set up the program in  1975 also gave it a very strong bureaucratic structure which isn't easy to dismantle," she said, adding that SFU plans  to hire another instructor for women's  studies this year.  The Women's Studies Program in the Interdisciplinary Studies Department at 'Vancouver Community College, Langara, is  barely hanging on. However, it remains  the only collectively-structured department at the college and has been cut to  only one  course per semester explicitly  devoted to Women's Studies.  This fall, the course will be "Perspectives on Women", and will deal with the  psychology and anthropology of women's  lives, focussing on the theme of women's  power. The course start September 15.  In an attempt to save Women's Studies at  Langara, the instructors are developing  a Women's Studies Diploma Program. Details will be available this fall through  the Counselling Services at Langara.  Simon Fraser women purge pornography  by Laurie White  Women students at Simon Fraser University  are actively campaigning against the presence of pornographic magazines on their  campus. Together, the Simon Fraser Student  Society, CUPE 2396, and the SFU Women's  Centre have demanded the university  immediately discontinue retailing and  stocking these types of publications.  The Canadian National Institute for the  Blind, which had been selling seven varieties of pornographic magazines at their  campus concession, immediately responded  to the student demand and removed all  seven from their stand. The University  Bookstore, however, continues to stock two  different porn magazines and the university  library refuses to cancel its subscription.  In a meeting with university librarian  Ted Dobb, students argued that porn publications objectify and demean women and  therefore should not have a place in an  educational institution, whose role  should be to promote the advancement,  respect for, and equality of all women.  They also argued that at a time when the  library has been forced to discontinue  subscriptions to other publications, due  to budgetary cutbacks, it is inappropriate  to maintain a subscription to Playboy  magazine.  Dobbs did not agree on the grounds that  to do so would be a clear act of censorship. The Student Society does not accept  his censorship argument on two counts.  First, the material is available off  campus, and second, the library and bookstore both make daily decisions as to  what will or will not be carried, especially in a time of tight budgets.

In the meantime, students are arguing  that pornographic magazines manipulate,  rather than educate their readers and  that students would prefer publications  of more intrinsic worth.

Over 600 women attended the Ottawa conference to examine issues and make recommendations in the areas of employment,  training and re-training, education,  health and safety, information access and  the legislation related to all aspects of  the microtechnology industry.  Delegates agreed to send a letter to all  federal MPs insisting employers be compelled under federal jurisdiction to train  and retrain women, and will request the  Canada Employment and Immigration Commission to set up programs and funds directed  towards the advancement of women in the  microtechnology industry.  In the area of education, the conference  agreed to pressure ministries of education and school boards to introduce  measures to ensure high school girls pursue math and science studies, and are  given proper counselling about careers  requiring these subjects.  Health and safety was of particular concern to the delegates given the possible  radiation hazards of video display terminals. They are demanding more information  on the subject and will work to ensure  all workers become informed about the  health dangers and stresses involved in  certain jobs in the microtechnology industry.  Kinesis  will provide a more detailed  report of this conference, in particular  the information communicated in major  workshops, in the next issue.

Part-time inquiry needs  feminist contribution  The fastest-growing sector of the Canadian  work force in the past six years has been  women part-time workers who have increased  by 55 percent, compared to a growth rate  of 18 percent for the work force as a  whole.  In February of this year the federal government struck a Commission of Inquiry in  to Part-Time Work which will hold public  hearings throughout Canada this fall and  will report to the government early in  1983.  The Vancouver Status of Women is planning  on making a submission to the Vancouver  hearings scheduled for October 4 and 5.  If anyone is interested in working on this  project, call Hilarie McMurray or Jan  DeGrass at the VSW office: 876-2849.  CBC releases study of  women's TV portrayal  CBC has just released a study of the  presence, role and image of women in prime  time television programming. The study  was commissioned by the CBC in an attempt  to grapple with the portrayal of women on  television.  The final report includes a comprehensive  analysis of CBC's prime time programming  as well as documentation concerning the  perceptions of a broad spectrum of the  Canadian public and CBC personnel.  Although the report is without specific  recommendations, it does manage to cite  many problem areas which conceivably will  aid CBC in reducing its stereotypic and  sexist imagery.  Slander charges dropped  against students  The committee defending the three journalism students who were being sued for  slander and libel by three professors of  Carleton university has announced a  successful end to the legal action.  Professors Brian Nolan, Robert Rupert and  Roger Bird took legal action against the  women following a March 1981 press conference where Maureen McEvoy, Susan Dusel  and Deborah Woolway announced a series of  recommendations to deal with the problems  of sexual harassment that had come to  light in the Journalism school at Carleton.  Defense Committee chair Cindy Hansen called the settlement a real victory since  "the issue at hand was sexual harassment  and Dusel, McEvoy and Woolway's actions  helped to focus on the problem so many  women in institutions and workplaces  have." The recommendations contained in  the report that led to the litigation have  been adopted by the university. "The stand  the women took set an example for women  everywhere."  Hansen said the Defence Committee sucess-  fully raised enough money to cover legal  costs for the women. "We'd like to thank  everyone, groups and individuals, from  across Canada, who contributed support to  this legal victory."  Media report to present  recommendations  The long awaited report and recommendations by the CRTC Task Force on Sex-Role  Stereotyping in the Media is due to be  released the beginning of September. The  report, printed as a book called Images  of Women  will be presented to the CRTC,  the Secretary of State, the minister in  charge of women's issues, and the press  by Marianne Barrie, President of the Task  Force.  The mandate of the Task Force was to draw  up guidelines and recommendations that  would rid the air waves of sexist content.  It has taken almost three years for the  Task Force to reach a consensus on how  the problem should be dealt with.  The October issue of Kinesis  will print  the official recommendations as well as  the additional guidelines presented by  the public members (feminists) who did not  believe the Task Force guidelines went  far enough. Images of Women  can be obtained from the government bookstore once it  has been released. If you are a women's  group, you are entitled to a free copy.  Women encouraged to  apply for training funds  As a result of the passage of the National  Training Act  on June 22, non-profit organizations and the provinces can now draw  upon a $108 million fund over the next  two fiscal years.  The New Skills Growth Fund  is set up to  provide training in occupations of  "national importance" or in any occupation  suitable for "adults with special training  needs (i.e. women). Capital funding is  available as well as funding for initial  operating and course development costs in  certain cases.  Training project proposals from private  non-profit groups should be submitted to  Canada Employment and Immigration regional  offices for preliminary review. Assistance  in developing project poposals is available  from regional managers.  At a July 12 meeting in Vancouver Lloyd  Axworthy encouraged women's organizations  to apply for funding from the program.  In B.C. inquiries should be directed to:  B.C./Yukon Territory, Regional Manager  of Training, CEIC, Royal Centre, 1055  W. Georgia St., P.O. Box 11145, Vancouver,  B.C. V6E 2P8, or call 666-2282.  Federal tribunal dismisses  first harassment case  The first federal human rights tribunal  to enquire into a sexual harassment complaint has dismissed the case. The tribunal had been appointed January 16, 1981  following an investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission into Bonnie  Robichaud's complaint that her foreman,  Dennis Brennan had made sexual advances  to her.  The tribunal concluded that because Brennan had stopped the sexual advances once  it was made clear they were unwelcome, he  had therefore not harassed Robichaud.  The Canadian Human Rights Act bans discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion,  age, sex, marital status, conviction for  which pardon has been granted and physical  handicap. However, there is no express  reference to sexual harassment.  Sexual favors called for  in job specifics  In what is thought to be the first case  of its kind in Canada, a Toronto businessman has been found not guilty of trying  to procure young women to have sex with  clients of his firm.  Because none of the witnesses called by  the Crown had actually been hired by Mr.  Melvin Deutsch of Global Franchise Marketing—they had refused the job outright—Judge Graburn explained he could  only be found guilty if he had actually  hired a woman under the job specifications  he outlined.  "It was manifest from the taped interview  (an undercover policewoman taped her job  interview) that the job specifications  entailed having sexual relations with  clients and customers," said the judge.  (KirkMakin, Globe & Mail)  Women's wages still  less than half a man's  The average income received by women in  1980 was less than half that received by  men, according to Statistics Canada figures.  Women earned an average of $8,242 in 1980,  a 12.3%  increase from the previous year. 6    Kinesis    September 1982  HEALTH  Fall groups now underway  You probably already know that the Vancouver Women's Health Collective has information on birth control, vaginal infections and cervical self-exam. But did you  also know that we have information on  herbs, occupational health, stress, lesbian health and more than 200 other topics?  We will be organizing several health  groups this fall, including a "Dealing  with Stress" group and a menopause group  in September and a holistic health group  in October. Our groups are usually a  combination of information sharing, discussion, support, and problem solving as  well as looking at health issues from a  political perspective. Childcare can be  arranged if we are notified in advance.  We are also starting a Thursday afternoon  drop-in which will provide an informal  meeting place for women to discuss a variety of health issues and become more  familiar with the Health Collective. Topics could include food and nutrition,  stress, prescription drug use, patients'  rights, and any issues women who drop; in  want to raise.  The Diaphragm Fitters Collective continue  to do diaphragm fittings in a relaxed  atmosphere that allows for plenty of questions and discussion. Since January, there  is also a group of women who fit cervical  caps. Appointments are needed for both  diaphragm and cervical cap fittings. Also,  free pregnancy testing and pregnancy and  abortion counselling continue to be available.  One Saturday afternoon each month is  Skill Sharing day where women can learn  breast and cervical self-exam, and be  shown how PAPS and vaginal cultures are  taken. We are planning to start a skills  sharing group for women who want to learn  these types of skills in an on-going way  and share them with other women. Anyone  interested in this should come to the  next skills day or call for more information.  Our resource center continues to grow. As  mentioned earlier, we have over 200 files  plus 600 books and numerous journals on  a wide variety of health topics ranging  from allergies to X-rays. For those women  looking for a doctor, massage therapist,  counsellor, naturopath or chiropractor,  we have hundreds of evaluations on health  practioners in Vancouver and the Lower  Mainland. We do not recommend specific  health practitioners, but the evaluations  are available for anyone to look through.  We are always in need of more feedback,  so if you haven't filled out an evaluation  on health practitioners you have seen,  drop by or call for evaluation forms.  We are having a six-week training group  for women who would like to work as non-  paid staff in the resource center. Interested women need to share our feminist,  anti-capitalist perspective and be able  to work one afternoon shift per week, as  well as come to a monthly meeting. The  training group will be on Thursday mornings starting sometime in mid-September.  We are also trying to expand the number  of women who act as resource people—  women who have experienced a particular  health problem who would like to be available to other women to share information  and experience. We especially need resource women who are able to talk to  others about cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer.  In September we will be having a series  of talks on drugs, including a critical  look at the drug industry, the use of  psychiatric drugs, over-the-counter drugs  and the hazards of synthetic hormones.  Starting in mid-October, we will be available to speak to groups on a variety of  health topics.  Two groups affiliated with the Health  Collective are also very active this  fall. In September, the Women's Action  on Occupational Health (WA00H) will be  giving a course on reproductive hazards  and the workplace at Capilano College.  For information and registration, contact  the College. Both WA00H and the Video  Display Terminal (VDT) group are available  to speak to people about their workplace  and its effect on their health.  The Women's Health Research Group is completing a booklet on Pelvic Inflammatory  Disease (PID) which will be available this  fall. Their next project is researching  spermacides, how they work and their  effect on women's health. Anyone interested in working with them can contact the  Health Collective for more information.

Women, professionals and birth-minded .  consumers will gather to explore the options available to women giving birth outside large urban areas. To date, all conferences on birth in B.C. have taken place  in large cities where options are readily  available to those women and parents who  wish to seek them out.  "Exploring the Options: Birth in a Small  Town" is the theme of this conference.  For more information or a registration  form, write the Northern Childbirth Conference, 2127A Hemlock St., R.R.#2,  Terrace, B.C., or call 635-2942.  Women's health book  According to The Complete Book of Women's  Health,by G. Hongladarom, R. JcCorkle and  N. F. Woods, the women's movement and the  consumer's movement have changed women's  attitudes to their own health as well as  parts of the medical system.  "It's not surprising women have been poorly characterized by the health care system.  For too long, when women listed their  symptoms and concerns entering the system,  they were discounted and treated with  tranquilizers, sugar-coated pills and  sugar-coated talk," say the authors.  They noted that women are the majority  users of health care, and also comprise  the majority of workers in the health  care system.  The book is a collection of articles aimed  at women who "want to learn about the  uniqueness of their health and how to manage or seek care for related problems."  The Province  Manual birth-control  promoted  A recent American study says women who use  diaphragms and similar contraceptives are  40 percent less likely than other women to  develop a severe case of pelvic disease.  The. study estimates use of barrier methods  of contraception - diaphragms, condoms,  spermicidal foams, jellies or creams -  reduces the number of episodes of pelvic  inflamatory disease among women of child-  bearing age each year by some 20,000.  The study was conducted at 16 hospitals in  the United States and focused on women aged  18 to 44- The findings are reporting in the  July 9 issue of the Journal of the American  medical Association. It is estimated that  about one million women in the United State  are treated for pelvic inflammatory disease  each year.  In an editorial, Dr. William 1 cCormack says  women who have intra-uterine devices have  a two to four times greater chance of developing the pelvic infection than women  who use barrier methods. .   . , -, "  Assoctated Press September 1982   Kinesis   7  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  New wave of automation fragments women's work  by Marianne Van Loon  A new wave of automation is rushing into  the office, and this microelectronic inundation is affecting not only the number  of jobs but the very nature of work.  "This is true for everybody in the workplace, but I think it is a specific problem for women," Margaret Benston, SFU computing science and women's studies professor, said in the first of the SFU Women's  Centre summer series on women, science  and technology.  Automation is particularly problematic for  women because in our society machines are  an area outside of women's expertise.  "Technology is perceived as a male realm."  Most women won't find solutions to the  problem in retraining and education although this has been the government's  major response because, said Benston,  these do not deal with .control of the  technology, where It comes from, and why  it is introduced into the office. And,  even with retraining, there are still not  enough new jobs to go around.  This new wave of automation will have a  major effect in offices which are increasingly supported by microtechnology-based  machines which perform functions such as  word processing, electronic file storage  and automatic payrolling.  Resulting from the increased automation  there will be a major loss of office jobs  in the next decade. In 1979 unemployment  in the clerical field was seven per cent.  It will at least double and may rise as  high as 40 per cent in the next eight  years, she said.  To understand the factors in automation,  and the consequent deskilling of workers,  it is necessary to look at the historical  beginnings. In pre-industrial production,  artisans worked in households. They controlled the entire work process starting  from raw materials to finished products.  "This was the original unalienated labour,"  Benston said. Women were crucial in home-  based production and had all the skill  necessary to run the business.  This system changed as entrepreneurs became dirctly involved and changed the  organization of production.  Dividing the work into single tasks and  assigning each task to a different group  of people was the first major step towards  automation. Under this division of labour  individual workers required less skill,  because they did not make a finished product, but only took one part in the entire process. Each task could also be  performed faster, and with the decreased  level of skill, wages were lowered.  However, now the boss had to have a basic  understanding of all steps involved in  making the product, giving them control  of production. As each step in production  is reduced to its simplest, most repetitive form either a machine and operator or  a machine alone can take over the task.  "There is no reason why a machine can't  replace a worker then," Benston said.  The assembly line is the culmination of  these trends towards automation. The most  extreme example is a Toyota plant in Japan  in which there are no workers, only machines. "Productivity means fewer people  producing more goods: jobs get lost,"  Benston said.  Early in the industrial revolution people  made dire predictions that there would be  no jobs for anybody, but that didn't  happen. Not only did production increase  enormously, but the markets expanded internationally.  New kinds of jobs were created to process  all of the information needed to run  industries. The details of production, no  longer stored in artisans' heads, had to  be written down and kept track of, so  the paperwork increased enormously. Women  found a major area of employment in this  new expanding "service" area.  The early days of information handling  involved male clerks, usually management  trainees performing all office functions.  "XX"  But as information needs exploded, this  labour was divided into smaller tasks,  and women found a major source of employment.  This division of labour in the information  service sector occurred for the same reasons as division of labour in material  production. In conjunction with machines,  particularly the typewriter, dividing  labour into small, repetitive steps greatly  increased the information which could be  processed.  The sequence of automation in the office  is straightforward, Benston said. First  came the typewriter, then IBM cards, mechanical sorters and electronic tabulators.  Then came the Xerox machine, and now it's  microtechnology.  Typing and filing are areas of work in the  office which have been divided into specific functions. "This is clearly fragmentation and de-skilling," said Benston. The  introduction of the word processor is  merely the latest step in the trend towards automation. The word processor, replacing two to four regular typists, greatly increases productivity. Some word processors have built-in monitors for such  things as number of key strokes, errors,  and exact time spent working on the machine, further increasing management's control of the worker.  Jobs such as word processing are jobs  that require no thought at all, and very  little physical motion. They are completely  factory jobs. Offices are looking more and  more like factories, with division of  labour, managment control of the process  of production and increased productivity  as a motivation, Benston said.  Because of the productivity gains from  automating offices, up to 40 per cent of  office workers are predicted to be out of  work by 1990.  Benston thinks it is unlikely there will  be displacement without a net loss of jobs.  Major expansion opportunities for markets  have already been realized, both foreign  and at home.'Furthermore, the types of  jobs likely to arise from automation are  not themselves major growth areas.  There are fewer jobs created in operating  the new equipment, such as word processors.  New jobs in maintenance and repair are  problematic for women, who are excluded  from technological training by lack of  prerequisite courses such as math in high  school, and by outright discrimination.  Although this is a perceived male field,  more and more women are fighting their  way in, but these jobs too are being  automated. New machines are self-diagnosing  and modular, greatly decreasing both skill  required and the number of jobs in this  area.  Computer software programming has been a  major growth area in the past ten years.  But, although there are increasingly more  women programming, especially in lower  levels, the number of jobs created falls  far short of the number that will be lost  due to office automation. And there are  trends in software too towards automation  that will put programmers out of work.  For women, access to the control and direction which the new technology takes is  not a possibility. "Technology is not  something that's simply available for  people in this society to take charge of,"  said Benston. "It's unrealistic to expect  that we can simply walk in, get our half  of the jobs and somehow solve the problem  of women's relationship to technology.  It's much deeper than that."  "The technology is introduced for very  clear reasons: productivity gains, control  of worker performance, control of the  whole production process—gains in profit.  And that's the logic of technology," said  Benston.  The logic of technology is basically industrial logic, based on productivity and  profit and not on the use of technology  to lighten jobs and make work more human,  As a result of automation and technology,  people, especially women, are faced with  fighting for really unpleasant jobs.  "These are jobs that people probably simply  shouldn't be doing. They are drudgery,  they are inhuman. They are things that  automation and technology can replace,  and are replacing," Benston said.  Even if machines take over all of society's  dangerous and drudge work, there will be  problems. "The consequences now of that  technology are going to be unemployment.  We are running straight into really serious social contradictions, into really  serious problems," she said.  There are few practical solutions for  women, but as unemployment in the office  rises, women should have an equal chance  for newly created jobs. The jobs that are  created should be opened to everyone, and  fighting for access to them is important  for women, Benston said.  "Technological change is not entirely  inevitable, but the only power women have  is collective action, probably unions, but  not in the form that unions exist for  women right now. They must deal directly  with women's problems," Benston said.  Education is also important. The argument  about training and retraining is a way of  blaming the victim. This implies that it  is your own fault if you can't get a job,  said Benston. And furthermore, for most  women this option isn't even a solution.  "One of the major things that we can do  is continually talk about this as a general social problem, and avoid the myth  that individuals are to blame if they  don't manage to succeed. Only in that  context are there going to be searches  for a collective solution," Benston said. 8   Kinesis   September 1982  DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE  Women face violence, welfare struggle  by Jan De Grass  The downtown eastside, one of the oldest  areas in the city, is a sprawling region  of rooming houses, hotels, industry, old-  fashioned homes, greasy cafes and a lot  of street life. It is bounded by the Ray  Cam housing development in the east and  pushes into the downtown business area in  the west. It includes, and yet is separate  from, Chinatown and the Chinese residential area, Strathcona.  Over 85% of the population is male, and  local services-drop-ins, Salvation army  hostel, soup and sandwich lines, are predominantly male-oriented. Of the 15%  female population some 70 to 90% of them  live below the poverty line. These women  are more unhealthy and die younger than  women in any other area of the city.  Most of the women live in rooming houses,  by themselves or with kids. In some cases  she may be the only woman in a hotel full,  of 40 or 50 men. They share a great many  of the facilities with the men, everything from the bathroom to the cockroaches. Often the hotels are cold, damp,  shoddy and the women are sometimes ha-:  rassed for sexual favours from the landlords.  Fortunately there is a place where these  women can escape their surroundings, get  a cup of coffee, and participate in something interesting-the Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre.  The centre is located in a dilapidated  house on Hastings not far from Gore Street.  Inside, the house is quite cozy, with  notice boards, ever-full coffee urn,  library, donated clothing room and space  for activities.  Started 8 years ago, the Downtown East-  side Women's Centre receives 75% of its  funding from Ministry of Human Resources  and a City Social Services grant. It's a  small amount of service to provide considering the enormous problems that east-  side women face: lack of housing, welfare  struggles and violence.  Joy Thompson, who works at the centre,  points to these three issues as the  topics most frequently discussed, but she  acknowledges that the common thread for  all the women who use the centre is  poverty.  Very few of the women hold a job. Money,  when and if it comes, is from social  assistance: HPIA, CIP, VIP and a host of  other programs whose initials may change  but whose substance provides or supplements a limited income.  "For some it's hard enough work just to  survive," said Joy. "Many women don't  have the confidence, the skills or the  living situation to hold down a full-  time job."  For those who are physically ill or have  a history of mental turmoil employment is  simply not an option. For those who are  younger or healthier incentive is sadly  lacking. The downtown eastside is a jobless ghetto and their address holds a  certain stigma. According to reports,  police on this beat refer to it as 'garbage  detail".  Yet the centre does not serve a "social  agency" function. "These people have been  counselled to death," says Joy. "What we  do have here is a kind of 'across the  table' counselling. Mostly the women come  here just to talk."  Housing, how to find it, how to afford it  and, for some being able to stand it is  a major topic of conversation. It's ironic  and cruel in that many of the older residents have lived in this part of the city  for years. Far from the stereotype of the  downtown eastside as all ex-loggers and  transients, they are, in fact, one of  Vancouver's oldest and most stable group  of residents.  Some of those taking part in activities  at the newly refurbished Carnegie Centre  (Main at Hastings) can remember when the  Carnegie Library was first built. Older  Chinese women have often lived all of  their lives in Chinatown, working and  lets explaining current issues, for  example, the pamphlet circulated at the  last pro-choice rally, has been translated. When the centre sponsors films  and discussion groups, many are translated and English classes are held there  three times a week.  Breaking down barriers at the centre between the Chinese women, aboriginal women  (30% of participants) and the remaining  30% white women who frequent it is an ongoing process. Joy pointed to a poster  announcing a hamburger, soup and dessert  lunch-the centre's once monthly social.  "Last month was the North American lunch,"  she said. "Next month will be the Chinese  lunch..."  "We really are a community  centre-it meets  the needs of this  community and these  women. We really don't attract a middle  class segment of the population, in that  way we're different from other women's  centres," says Joy. "However, we do need  concrete support from other women's groups.  The Women's Health Collective has been  here to put on their program and we would  like to see others."  The centre could also use donations of  typewriters and duplicators. This year,  44The area's history and development is still fresh in the minds of  these women who are, on average, older than women who frequent  other centres.''  raising their families, rarely leaving  their own neighbourhood. The same neighbourhood threatens to change around them  as more and more residential hotels  vanish into the destructive maw of B.C.  Place.  The area's history and development is  still fresh in the minds of these women  who are, on the average, older than women  who frequent other women's centres in  the city-usually between 40 and 80 years  old. "The younger women hang out at  Carnegie Centre, mostly to meet younger  men," Joy says.  Over 40% of the women who use the centre  are Chinese. For those who do not speak  English, a translator is available. Leaf-  for the first time, they did not receive  their summer employment program, which  allows them to hire three students to work  on specific projects. The centre remains  chronically under-staffed and volunteers  are welcome.  The most positive thing that emerges about  life in the downtown eastside is the  amount of caring evident among the women.  "People do care about each other here,"  said Joy. "I do a lot of outreach, and  when I go out on the streets I'm stopped  and asked questions by everyone-how's my  son, did I go to the last welfare rights  rally, do we still have mice at the  women's centre? and so on. The women all  know each other too, and look out for each  other's welfare." September 1982   Kinesis   9  RESOURCES  Video aids porn discussion  Not a Love Story - A Discussion Guide,  24 p. booklet, Vancouver Status of  Women, 1982.  Pornography: A Women's Issue,   3/4" color  videotape, 1 hour, 1982.  In the fall of 1981, the National Film  Board's Studio D released the film Not A  Love Story: A Film About Pornography.  Reviewers called it everything from "the  frankest movie ever produced by the Film  Board's ...women's studio" to "bourgeois  feminist fascism" and even "an offensive  belch".  Tempers flared and emotions erupted as  groups of viewers debated the film's  merits and reacted to its content across  the country. In Quebec, the film's director, Bonnie Klein, pushed for public  showings, and soon audiences flooded the  theatres. In Ontario, the Censor Board  flexed its muscles, and in other provinces  the debate carried on over whether or not  this was a film for "public" viewing.  After previewing the film in B.C., several representatives of local feminist  groups agreed that some discretion was  needed in where and how the film was used.  (Its images are at the very least upsetting, and for some people intensely disturbing.) They recommended screening the  film through organized groups but not in  public theatres. Their hope was to encourage those using the film to show it  in an environment where productive discussion could take place afterwards.  To a greater or lesser extent, this has  been happening in B.C. through the NFB  distribution offices. However, the degree  of intensity and wide range of reactions  that viewers have to the film often  surprise even the most well-intentioned  facilitators, and in some cases have led  to anything but productive discussion.  Consequently, in early 1982, a group of  B.C. feminists approached the Secretary  of State for funds to produce a users'  guide for the film, and not long after,  the Not A Love Story Media Kit was born.  Produced in a record six weeks by Gayla  Reid and Pat Feindel, the kit, including  a booklet and videotape, aims to prepare  facilitators for the kinds of issues and  questions that are raised by the film's  viewers. The kit starts from a decidedly  feminist bias, and attempts to expand  and clarify some of the points raised in  the film. It also gives further background on the pornography industry and  suggests ways of reponding to questions  most often asked by viewers.  The hour-long videotape Pornography: A  Women's Issue,  begins with some brief  opinions on pornography expressed by  various women, giving a sample of just  how widely opinions can differ on the subject. The program moves on to a panel dis  cussion and Interview clips with five  Vancouver feminists who have facilitated  showings of Not A Love Story.  One of the most common problems these  women have faced is the different ideas  about what pornography actually is. Frances Wasserlein (Battered Women's Support  Services) clarifies the confusion by giving a feminist definition of pornography  and comparing it to others that have been  used. From here the discussion leads to  how to present the film. Jan Barnsley  (Women's Research Centre) and Julie Brickman (feminist psychologist) discuss different reactions of women and men to the  film, and the advantages or disadvantages  of segregated or mixed screenings. Eleanor  Wachtel (journalist) quotes Toronto's  illustrious film reviewers to illustrate  just how defensive male reactions can be,  and offeres suggestions for how to avoid  similar responses from male members of  an audience.  Several of the women interviewed strongly  recommend giving an introduction prior to  showing the film, before the emotional  impact of its images has taken hold. Debra  Lewis (co-author of Rape: The Price of  Coercive Sexuality)  and Frances Wasserlein  offer fairly detailed suggestions as to  how this can be handled to encourage and  allow for an open and fruitful discussion  following the showing.  Responding to interviewer Gayla Reid's  questions, the women also address several  issues that filmviewers often raise: how  pornography as "fantasy" relates to women's  experience in reality, the pain women must  confront when viewing pornography, censorship and freedom of speech, and what women  can do about pornography.  The booklet Not A Love Story - A Discussion  Guide  highlights several points made in  the videotape, including ideas for introducing the film and responses to questions  raised about pornography. It also contains  some practical tips for organizing a screening in a community, relevant quotes from  feminists on the subject of pornography,  and a short resource list of further materials.  Discussion and debate about pornography  will undoubtedly rage on for some time—  the film Not A Love Story  continues to be  solidly booked from the NFB in B.C., and  is now being distributed internationally.  Hopefully, this kit will allow more information and feminist analysis to circulate  with the film. And hopefully too, it will  act as one more catalyst in developing  strategies and actions that challenge the  pornography industry.  The videotape and booklet are available for  loan or purchase at the Vancouver Status  of Women, 400A West 5th Avenue, Vancouver.  (Sale: $75.00, Loan: Donations accepted.)  Network to broadcast women's series  This fall, Knowledge Network will be  broadcasting an omnibus film series called  Women's Eye View.   Running from September  3 to January 9, programs will be aired on  Fridays at 12:30 pm and Sundays at 7 pm.  Intended to counter the stereotypic and  often degrading images of women presented  on television, the series addresses several issues affecting the reality of  women's lives. Such topic areas include  health, work, women's history, violence  against women and women's film.  A resource booklet entitled Because We  Are Women  has also been produced. The  booklet contains articles and information  relating to the issues raised in the programs and is available at Ariel Books.  Kinesis will carry a listing of programs  in the Bulletin Board.  People interested in tuning into Women's  Eye View should check local listings for  the channel carrying Knowledge Network  programming. Vancouver and Victoria both  require convertor pick-up, but all other  areas in B.C. broadcast on regular channels.  Video group  records struggles  Amelia Productions  is a feminist video  production collective that has worked  together for more than a year. So far,  Amelia  has produced fourteen video tapes  concerned with women's issues: maternity  leave, equal pay, work environments and  other labour related issues; native  women's concerns, lesbian issues, and wife  battering, to name but a few. Produced out  of the Vancouver East Cable 10 office,  all the videos have been aired on Cable  10, but because of numerous requests from  women wanting to view the tapes, Amelia  is planning a series of shows for the fall.  Presently there are five members of the  collective: Billie Carroll, Sarah Davidson,  Sara Diamond, Ellen Frank, and Gay Hawley.  All five came to Amelia with a variety of  skills, interests and backgrounds, recognizing the need for a feminist video  production group that could document the  struggles women face.  When members of the Telecommunication  Workers Union occupied the B.C. Tel offices after fourteen months of negotiations  the collective went to the worksite and  interviewed women who talked about their  oppressive working conditions and the  wage inequalities between the plant operations (mostly men) and the clerical and  operator staff (mostly women). TWU Tel  and This Line Is Not In Service  were  Amelia's  first projects.  When native women occupied the Department  of Indian Affairs office in Vancouver in  1981, Amelia recorded their concerns,  documented their meeting with Senator  Perrault, and followed their arrests and  subsequent support organizing. This tape  is called Concerned Aboriginal Women  Amelia  also organized a crew to video the  1982 International Women's Day events in  Vancouver. After covering the march and  rally, the women packed up and went to the  Equal Pay Today rally later that evening.  Amelia Productions  has organized a series  of screenings of their productions. Each  showing will have approximately 90 minutes  of videotape, allowing time for discussion  between programs.

No one  knew how old she really was but the guesses ranged from mid-60's to mid-90's.  People did a lot of talking and guessing  about Mary Johnson and they mulled over  the few facts they knew about her.  No one ever looked her in the eye when  they spoke to her. No one ever walked in  front of her. She knew all the old legends and she remembered the language. In  a lot of ways, Mary did her best to uphold her tantalizing, mysterious and  slightly dangerous image.  In the early 1970's, she had a pole raising (the first in many years) to honour  her family, the Fireweed Crest of the  Killer Whale Clan. CBC just happened to  be in the area and they just happened to  film it.  A few years later, when CBC, once again,  was "passing through", Mary held the first  divorce feast in 75 years. It was a huge,  theatrical affair complete with a dinner  of beaver, porcupine and soapberries.  Her divorce songs were her original  marriage songs with small word changes.  Instead of claims of undying love they  became scathing comments on the attributes of her much younger ex-husband.  Her public claims to power and her insistence that her sense of timing is due to  an innate connection to the universe are  out of synch with the reality of her community today. But instead of changing her  lifestyle she has and is working to reintegrate old ways with new.  Mary Johnson was instrumental in forming  Bibliography:  Agnes Deans Cameron: The New North,  D.

She  practices the old ways of her band; when  a woman died, Mary adopted her young  daughter.  She is not a saint. She is proud, arrogant, stubborn, used to getting her own  way. She enjoys her own power. She fights  for a matriarchal way of living, perhaps  not so much for political reasons, but  because that is how it was; therefore it  is the way to live.  She has a good sense of humour and loves  pranks.  According to Mary, people fear her because she is so like the Devil's Club  (w'ums) that she takes daily. (Devil's  Club is an emetic and cathartic herb,  used ritualistically by the hunters each  spring as a pre-hunting purge. Usually  the men are flat on their backs for weeks  after taking the herb. )  For further information on the Gitksan  and their way of life, here are some  suggested readings:  • The Gitksan Potlatch  by John W.

Agnes Deans Cameron: explorer  by Kandace Kerr  Agnes Deans Cameron: born Victoria,  December,   1863.   Teacher,  explorer, writer,  suffragette.  Died Victoria, May,  1912.  Agnes Deans Cameron was determined not to  be bound by conventional early 20th century Victoria. She believed in a women's  right to vote, to determine her own life—  an attitude which turned Edwardian Victoria on its earl By the age of 18, Agnes  was teaching in a Victoria school. After  being fired by the Vitoria school board  for strapping a pupil, she left B.C. and  moved to the United States to work as a  writer. She began by writing articles for  the Victoria papers on the 1893 World's  Fair in Chicago.  Urban life had its own brand of challenge,  but by 1908 Agnes was restless. She planned a trip to the Northwest Territories  with her neice, Jessie Cameron Brown  (whom she referred to as "The Kid"). From  the outset public reaction to her adventure was less than supportive. Agnes went  into a Chicago travel agent to make arrangements for the Arctic jaunt.  Going into the offices, I gently said, "I  wonder if you can give me information on  a trip I am anxious to make this summer?"  The young man smiled and his tone was that  which we accord to an indulged child. "I  guess we can. Cook & Son give information  on most places." "Very well," I said, "I  want to go from Chicago to the Arctic by  the Mackenzie River,  returning home I  the Peace and the Lesser Slave.   Can you  tell me how long it will take, what it  will cost and how I make my connections?"  He was game: he didn't move an eyebrow,  but went off... to consult  "the main guy",  "the chief squeeze",   "the head push",  "the big noise".   (The New North, 1910)  From Chicago Agnes and her 18 year old  niece Jessie travelled through Winnipeg  and Calgary and Edmonton, along the Athabasca and Mackenzie Rivers to the delta  of the Mackenzie— above the Arctic Circle.  They took over 200 photographs of their  travels, and on her return Agnes wrote  The New North,   an account of their journey.  The New North  is an invitation to white  society to settle in the north, but it is  also a plea to preserve and respect the  native way of life.  Six months and ten thousand miles of train,  raft and steamer travel later, Agnes em-  barded on an extensive lecture tour. Despite her earlier run-in with the Victoria  school officials, she was elected a school  board trustee, and became known for her  criticisms of outmoded ideas and campaigns  for school reforms.  In her obituary, The Victoria Daily  Colonist  remarked, "It is possible that  when the history of British Columbia comes  to be written the name of Agnes Deans  Cameron will be inscribed therein as the  most remarkable woman citizen of the  province." September 1982   Kinesis    11  CULTURE  by Michele Wollstonecroft  Festival   '82  was another unique beginning  for women in British Columbia. For the  first time in our "herstory", the individual talents of many B.C. women artists  were brought together under one roof.  From July 5-17, Vancouver's Robson Square  Media Centre resounded with dance,video,  jazz, film, panel discussions, workshops  and seminars, all dedicated to a celebration of women in the arts.  During the week there were evening events  that included featured readings by such  notably fine writers as Helen Potrebenko,  Gwen Pharis-Fingwood and Ann Roy, as well  as an evening for poetry and jazz.  Two nights were reserved for staging Anne  Cameron's play Rites of Passage.  Patricia  Best co-ordinated Playmaking,  an impromptu theatre piece that was written and acted out by the participating audience. Despite some cynicism amongst the audience,  the theatre did come alive the second  night with a 20-foot feminist lesbian  dragon breathing fire and making music.  Although this play was dependent on a  rather weak plot and relatively little  character development, the costumes were  varied and colourful and the audience appeared to enjoy participating.  Weekends scheduled morning workshops and  special afternoon events, including an  Festival '82:  Another  first for  B.C. women  in the arts  open reading by Dorothy Livesay and a  panel discussion by women in various arts.  Evenings saw the performance of Vancouver's own Persisters  as well as women's  film. If there is a criticism to be made  regarding scheduling, it is that too many  good things were happening at once.  In the auditorium, Shari Ulrich and Ferron  combined their talents to give a song-  writing workshop. The combination of these  two musicians made an extremely interesting and special morning for those who  The Double Whammy  by Michele Wollstonecroft  Being an artist proposes two enormous  lifelong burdens. The first is that one's  creative expression may not be appreciated  by the majority of people. The second is  that most likely the artist will not be  able to make a living at their craft.  Being a woman artist presents the "double  whammy". Not only will the lack of an  aesthetically educated public be an obstacle, but the established dominant culture may not understand or give validity  to a women's work within her own field.  And, since the dominant male culture controls the few viable routes for selling  and distributing creative work (galleries,  theatres, the media, the Canada Council  and other award groups), women artists  are even less likely to be able to make a  living at their work compared to males in  the same field.  These issues were the subject of a Women  and the Arts  panel discussion held on  July 11 as part of the Festival '82 activities. The panel was moderated by Eleanor  Wachtel and included Sandy Duncan, Helene  Rosenthal, Avis Lang Rosenberg, Hilda  Westercamp, Bonnie Kreps and Paula Ross.  The main issues concerned the relationship between who determines the nature of  content and aesthetics and the earning  power of the woman artist.  Choreographer Paula Ross says women in  dance have only recently lost their influence. Women dominated dance until commercial interest brought about the technical training of men. Currently men set  dance standards and ultimately run the  dance world. For Paula, whose company of  dancers range in height from four to six  feet and are of varying physical qualities,  her work celebrates the "visual poetry of  uneven body types". Not surprisingly, her  work has been heavily scrutinized by  current dance critics. Apparently one  critic observed that "women with large  breasts can't dance". Paula calls herself  a "defensive renegade" continuing to  choreograph the "uneven aesthetic of the  barefoot dancers" and of women with  breasts.  Bonnie Kreps, documentary filmmaker and  freelance journalist, is an articulate and  assertive personality who maintains a  "reformist female value system". This  means that Bonnie makes films and writes  participated. Besides singing, Shari and  Ferron presented an informal discussion  about their work, disclosed personal  experiences, encouraged questions about  their music, and talked about their songs.  Meanwhile, in another room an Aikido demonstration took place. About six women  Aikido students assisted instructor Lidia  Wolansky in sharing martial arts techniques. Many of the participants in this  workshop were blue T-shirted Wen-do women.  It was a treat for the feminist eye to  see these women, all accomplished at self-  defense, learning from one another.  Shawn Preuss gave a video workshop, instructing us in the basic electronic principles while demonstrating lighting and  camera work. Jean Kamins presented a  slide show, which was the 1982 equivalent  of the "salon des refusees". The show included all the slides contributed to the  exhibition. This gave a more accurate  idea of what is happening in the visual  arts among B.C. women than the juried  selection represented in the exhibition.  During the Performance Art evening, Cat  Majors presented a delightful and funny  piece, The Spring,  in which she employed  dance, costume, mime and ritual to the  music of Antonio Vivaldi's Four Seasons.  The Performance evening also included  Christina Estable's piece, entitled Unpaid  Labour.   This event was performed with the  collaboration of Heather Soles, Julie  Menard, Maria West, Leah Jewall, Judy Price  Betty Mackin, Linda Ruiz and Alma Estable.  Unpaid Labour  centred on the non-  remunerative work women are required to do  as mothers and wives, as well as the added  workload of the woman artist, which also  is, for the most part, unpaid.  Like Christina's performance, it was an  objective of the festival to give recognition to women's work in the arts, because, like women's work everywhere, it  goes unnoticed. Although well attended by  the public, this festival went relatively  unnoticed by the media. One would thing  the media would delight in an arts festival of this size and diversity. However,  despite extended effort by the publicity  committee, the media chose to ignore Festival   '82  and cover the Sea Festival instead.  Nevertheless, the Festival Committee is  delighted with the outcome of the many  months of planning and hard work. Hopefully some dialogue will spring out of  the efforts of this festival so that  women in the arts in B.C. can decide what  to exhibit in the future.  Cole Dudley in "We are not the Crazy Women" (Dance) September 1982   Kinesis    IS  FESTIVAL '82  FESTIVAL '82  Women artists: A double whammyl  continued from page 11  articles about what she sees as significant  subject matter, and is not swayed by the  established male film aesthetic.  Bonnie outlined three factors she believes  determine the nature of documentaries. I  was impressed with her analysis which can  be applied to women in other arts and the  media.  First, she said the subject matter of documentaries is usually decided by what men  consider significant from their perspective  of the world. This is true for the content  of most magazines, films and gallery exhibitions (commercial and artist-run). If  it is not men, it is often women who have  accepted the male perspective. What men  consider significant is obviously what gets  made into film, since men control the  funding.  Bonnie's second point is that this perspective is furthered by those whom the  film maker consults or includes as 'experts'. She gave an example of a film about  rape, where the 'experts' interviewed were  the police!  The third point that Bonnie sees affecting  documentary filmmaking is the absence of  enough technical women in the Canadian film  industry. She believes that there is "an  absolute connection between what goes on  behind the camera and what goes on in front  of it". She therefore tries to have as many  women on her crew as possible, however, she  noted that the unions are very male dominated.  As a woman who has worked in the technical  end of still photography for several years  I would like to emphasize this point. Men,  again seeing the world from their own perspective, make great assumptions about  their birthright to technology. Women who  train in any technical field rarely get  the support, encouragement or the training  that men do. If women succeed in completing  their training, the field is so male  dominated that women are often driven out.  A Vancouver film technician said recently,  "It is very lonely being a woman in the  film industry".  On the optimistic side of the panel discussion, Avis Lang Rosenberg, a teacher,  freelance critic, art historian and freelance curator, presented recent facts  about the Canada Council for the Arts.  Avis told us there are now an increasing  number of women on the juries. These juries  determine who receives the available funding, so we should see more women granted  awards as the situtation improves.  Helene Rosenthal, a poet and member of the  Canadian League of Poets, is probably best  known to Vancouver women for her work on  the Room of One's Own collective. Helene  was also instrumental in establishing the  feminist caucus with the Canadian League  of Poets.  Helene spoke of how the poetry establishment has kept women out. She criticized  male poets for being too concerned with  form and technical structure and praised  women's poetry for addressing the "spirit  of content".  Helene spoke of women poets as the  "priestesses of the language" because  they have spoken about women's lives,  dreams and histories. However, that which  corresponds to female iconography,  spirituality and sensibility have been  trivialized and ignored by formalist  critics she said, lamenting that women's  words have virtually been silenced by the  male literary tradition.  Hilda Westercamp has a background in classical music. It was apparent that Hilda  identified strongly with the established  tradition of the dominant male aesthetic  and is greatly influenced by those standards of form and content.  However, I found her theories about music  and those who participate in it to reflect  some of the same concerns Bonnie, Paula  and Helene had voiced.  Hilda believes that all people should be  encouraged to think of themselves as musical. Certainly that would put more women  in touch with our musical self-expression.  We would all learn attitudes that would  make us significantly able to decide for  ourselves what a 'music aesthetic' means  to us.  Hilda also discussed the history of music  from her interest in social history,  rather than simply the great musicians.  This echoed Bonnie's comments about the  'experts', promising to reveal many of the  women in our time and from the past who  have contributed to the music world without formal recognition.  There was some discussion amongst the  panel about the term 'women's art'. Avis  rejected the term as categorically dismissive and not specific enough. The rest  of the panel were comfortable with the term  and encouraged its use. However, Sandy  Duncan, fiction writer, thought the term  did not belong in the marketing of the  arts.  I was thrilled to see these seven proficient  women on the panel sharing their  experience and knowledge with those of us  who attended the festival. The discussion  addressed the issues that are indeed of  most immediate concern to women artists in  B.C. as well as to all women artists.  k      l*ta"—f    J.j  **4  "Swan Feet" performs for festival during an evening of dance.  Politics of content  by Cy-Thea Sand  "The Politics of Content", a panel discussion on women and writing for Festival   '82,  was chaired by novelist Jane Rule and  joined by bookseller Margo Dunn, co-owner  of Ariel Books; playwright Nora Randall;  educator Joan Hanna; poet and editor Leona  Gom of Event  magazine; and publisher Pat  Smith of ]  Any discussion of the politics of content  must address the sexism of the educational  and literary establishments where women's  writing is consistently underrated in  Canadian anthologies, textbooks, and curriculum guides. Joan Hanna spoke at length  on the stereotypic images of women in  elementary and high school texts, referring to a recently published anthology  used throughout British Columbia's educational system. Here, women are continually portrayed as clinging girls, nagging  wives and old maids.  women writers  Leona Gom detailed the ways in which women writers are discouraged. Leona cited  sexist book reviews which ignore content  and style to dwell on the gender of the  author. To make her point clear, Leona  read sample rejection letters women have  received from male editors. (There are  1.5 women editors for Canada's one hundred literary magazines, excluding feminist periodicals such as Fireweed  and The  Radical Reviewer.) The letters were insulting and demeaning; one male editor  told a woman one of his readers had vomited on her manuscript.'  Such abuse from male editors is an extreme  expression of the contempt generally held  for what is perceived as women's or feminist issues and perspectives. Dramatist  Nora Randall spoke of her experiences as  a script writer for the television show  The Beachcombers.   Nora said she must always keep aware of what is acceptable to  mainstream media by playing down her feminist analysis and desire to portray non-  traditional girls and boys. In one of her  Beachcombers  scripts, the female character is brave and competent in a dangerous  situation. Nora considers the show to be  a minor feminist feat.  continued on page 14  Persisters: positive female images  by Janie Newton-Moss  Rock music, like any musical form, is not  inherently sexist. What makes it sexist  more often than not is the exclusion of  women from its production.  For the majority of us growing up in the  60's and early 70's, fantasies about performing in a rock band were quickly obliterated when it became apparent that our  role was to be "consumers" not "producers" of rock music. Like it or not, we  had to content ourselves watching brothers and boyfriends experiment in garages  or basements and listening endlessly to  the radio.  Indeed, if we had felt comfortable in  that other role, who would we have imitated? The Supremes?...too sophisticated.  The Mamas and the Papas?...only half of  them were women. Fanny?...few of us ever  knew of their existence. The only women  instrumentalists playing rock music up  until the mid 70's were either tucked away  in mixed bands or working solo.  Women of 25 plus will not be able to  look back to their adolescence and talk  about their five favourite women rock  bands, but next generation...!  The Persisters, like other women's bands,  by choosing to play electric instruments  and by careful selection of material, are  able to give the high energy of the rock  medium a non-sexist character.  The Persisters  recently took part in  Festival   '82's Celebration of Women in  the Arts.   One of the disadvantages of  their performance was the choice of venue  —the cinema in the Robson Square Media  complex. The Persisters  are primarily a  dance band and are best seen and heard in  that context. However, the advantage for  this reviewer was that I was forced to  sit and listen to what they had to offer.  For me, having been disappointed with  most of the festival's offerings, the  Persisters  were a gem. They embodied what  the majority of the festival lacked—  positive images of women.  The last time I had seen them playing together was as members of Mystery Guest  at  the women's benefit for Co-op Radio. At  that time they seemed very nervous, showed a lot of potential, but were a little  too cautious in their choice of material.  At Festival   '82,  they were much more confident in their musicianship and were more  adventurous in their selection of songs  which ranged from a Fats Domino standard  through some Joan Armatrading and Lena  Lovich to a few strong originals.  I was pleased to see Doreen displaying her  newly acquired skill as a guitarist and  also that the band was willing to let members experiment with different vocal  styles, rather than confining themselves  to a particular "sound".  Their version of "We don't want that Fad-  ist Groove Thang", an English disco pop  song they tackled. Strong, adventurous,  humourous, I felt proud that they represented me and every other woman who has  always found the definition of rock music  as "noise for the boys" too limiting.  The members of the Persisters  are Janet  Lumb (saxes), Wendy Solloway (bass guitar),  Jorie Cedroff (drums), Doreen Allen (guitar ), and Mona Arens (keyboard).  'Rites of Passage' demystifies male hero  by Georgette Robitaille  Anne Cameron's The Rites of Passage,  staged during Festival   '82  is a play  about women speaking their own oppression,  about women giving their own account of  their lives in a small mining town.  Through dramatizing the interdependent  lives of three generations of women,  Cameron's play expresses a woman's vision  of the world where love, caring, and cooperation between strong female characters is considered a valid and necessary  struggle for growth and survival.  In this play the three generations of  women—Bess the elderly, Beth the mother  in her early thirties, and Maggy the  young teenager—help one another through  their different "passages" in life. Bess  is preparing herself to pass from life to  death. Beth is moving from an alienated  married life to a more independent and  emancipated one. Maggy is changing her  outlook and experience from a young and  undifferentiating one to a more mature,  responsible and understanding one.  These women, however, do not pass from  one stage to another with the help of  some rites (as the title may imply). Instead, they have a mutual and supportive  environment to help them through.  Addressing the generation gap, at several  points in the play Cameron makes clear  that one does not have to agree with  another in order to listen or to love.  Indeed, if Maggy's grandmother looks at  her granddaughter's desire of a worldly  and independent lifestyle (a dream modeled on her emancipated aunt's lifestyle  from the big city) with a bit of suspicion,  she nonetheless listens patiently to  Maggy's ideas.  The message here is that outlooks on life  will differ, but this does not stop basic  communication or the passage of knowledge. And it especially doesn't stop  these women from giving and receiving  basic affection and emotional support in  a genuine manner.  The same applies to Maggy's relationship  with her mother. Maggy's refusal to copy  Bess' domestic lifestyle doesn't stop  her from loving Bess a great deal. In  fact, what we find in these three generations of women, differing in their expectations and demands from life, is a micro-  cosmic community of women. A community  of women surviving poverty and oppression  through care and co-operation.  The cast's performance certainly made  credible for us Anne Cameron's vision of  these women. In addition, even if most of  us in the audience do not experience the  particular form of oppression depicted  in this play, we learn from these women's  experiences to be stronger ourselves,  since most of us as women, suffer at  least the shared oppression of our gender.  Cameron's play is not only interesting  in the vision of women that it promotes,  but also for the treatment that the author gives to this theatre genre—the oppressed miner. In that genre, women are  usually portrayed as the lamentors of  men's oppression, existing within the  narrative only to highlight the miners'  misery. Women's misery always takes a  secondary status and is never explored  from a woman's point of view. In Cameron's  play, not only is women's affliction in  the foreground, but it is also articulated  through a woman's voice.  And what is also interesting—even if men  have very little presence in the play—  is that the workers' concerns are not ignored altogether but rather are shifted  to form the background from which the  play is organized. This relocation of  the miners' exploitation at the background of women's oppression serves to  demystify this "figure larger than life"  that our theatre has often created: the  hero miner, the hero farmer from the  prairie, etc. This demystification denounces the victimization of women at  every level—even within oppressed groups.  Because theatre is, among other forms of  art, one mode of access to reality, the  demystification becomes important to women, since the reality of their own oppression within oppressed groups has often  been ignored. 14   Kinesis   September 1982  FESTIVAL '82  Festival characterized by lack of strong images  by Jill Pollack  For more than ten years, major exhibitions  of work by women artists have been held  throughout North America.  In 1971, Lucy Lippard curated the exhibition, Twenty Six Contemporary Women Artists  (Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut).  In 1973, Ten Artists   (Who Also Happen to  Be Women)  was held at the Kenan Art Centre  in Lockport, New York. In 1979, two major  exhibitions took place—27ze Dinner Party  and Women Artists 1550-1950.  This is not to say that women artists have  achieved enough recognition. Women artists  are still a minority within the gallery  system.  It was with expectation and enthusiasm  that I attended Festival   '82: A Celebration of Women in the Arts.  The preponderance of excellent women artists in B.C.  is overwhelming. Exciting, innovative,  strong work is being done here.  In my opinion, it was sadly lacking in  Festival   '82.   Instead, I saw:  • good work that had recently been seen  in other exhibitions (including Womansize  and B.C.  Festival of the Arts)  • a lack, by and large, of strong imagery  • a disproportionate amount of work by  a small number of artists and an absence  of work by, in my opinion, well-developed  artists  • excellent work by such artists as Jean  Affleck, Karen Chapnick, Donna Hagerman,  Doreen Jensen and Michelle Wollstonecraft,  that was poorly installed; and  • absolutely no biographical material  on the artists, or documentation of the  pieces other than sketchy information  such as "mixed media".  Dealing point by point with my criticisms,  which I feel focus on serious examples of  The politics of content  continued from page 12  The most interesting discussion during  this panel concerned women's seZ/-censor-  ing. Women writers, it seems, have not  only reactionary blue-penciling to contend with, but also the insidiousness of  silencing themselves. Many women writers  are still battling what Virginia Woolf  called the Angel in the House—women's  socialized need to please others at the  expense of honesty and truth.  Pat Smith argued that most of the women  writers who submit manuscripts to Press-  gang are losing the battle. Pat feels  that many of the manuscripts are marred  by too much self-editing; she often must  read between the lines to get a sense of  what the author is trying to say. Pat  said that in her experience, much of  women's writing is too nice, trimmed of  the disquieting complexities of human  relationships.  The workshop as a whole was disappointing.  The panel lacked a clear focus. The discussion often bogged down into repetition  and overstated points. While sexism was  addressed, issues of class and race were  not. Although the audience was a well-  informed one, little opportunity was given for active and consistent audience  participation.  A circular discussion group with resource  people and a facilitator seems a more  relevant type of forum. I hope that the  next time the workshop will be called the  sex/class/race politics of women's writing, and that there will be much more  anger in the room.  poor planning and curation, I would like  to stress that I am not denying the work  that went into holding this type of exhibition. It was an enormous task and a difficult one. I am writing this article to  point out the aspects I feel need to be  examined and from which we can learn.  The exhibition did contain good work—in  some respects, excellent work. Ihfortunate-  ly, a number of the better pieces in the  show had been exhibited before. I feel  that exhibiting work that had been previously (and recently) shown causes certain problems. It is too easy for critics,  the public, and gallery personnel to conclude that there simply was not enough  good, recent work to exhibit.  If an exhibition is to be defined as an  entity for feedback, exposure, entertainment and a medium for educating; and if  we are interested in changing the imbalance facing women artists, then we must  present new images to each other and the  public. I am not ignoring the validity or  aesthetic value of older work, but I am  saying we have to be aware of what an exhibition is, says, and does.  The exhibition seemed too  cautious; unable to challenge  anyone's thinking  My next point deals with the lack of strong  imagery. This is a very tricky, subjective  criticism. I was working under the assumption that since this was a festival by,  for and about women, there would be some  type of representation of the power and  strength of women. A sort of "The women's  movement is alive and well and living in  Vancouver". I assumed this from personal  experience. Having regularly seen a lot of  strong artwork made by women in B.C. during the last five years, I expected to  see a relative overview of that work.  However, what I was left me with the impression that the striving for personal  power and achievement of strength was just  around the bend, waiting in Seattle for  the next bus. I felt that Michelle Wollstonecroft' s three self-portraits were of  the technical quality, composition and  strength of imagery that I wanted to see,  but didn't, throughout the exhibition.  On the whole, the exhibition seemed too  cautious, too "middle-of-the-road", unable  to challenge anyone's thinking. Because it  was so "safe", to me it was not a celebration.  Have we been beaten already? Not taking  many chances may be a way to obtain funding but, in the long run, it holds us  back.  Some artists had six works in the exhibition. Some had one. Some had none. With  spatial restrictions, why exhibit six  works by one artist instead of representing more artists? We have heard there  were over 200 entries. Surely there could  have been a wider representation. I do  not know the adjudication criteria, but I  do know that I felt there were names  missing.  There are artists who are regularly producing innovative, strong work. Since the  exhibition seemed to be a survey of B.C.  women artists, although restricted to  those who submitted slides, why were  they left out?  The actual installation of an exhibition,  especially a group exhibition, is a long  and difficult job. Robson Square as an  exhibition space has many problems to  overcome. The display panels are old and  in poor condition-. The space is very wide  and there is no ceiling. Therefore, a lot  of care and planning must be done to overcome these difficulties. In Festival   '82,  the middle of the space was poorly used  and so were the moveable display units.  Lighting was poor. Work by individual  artists in some cases was hung together,  in others separately. I could see no pattern or reason for this.  If we are going to hail  something as a celebration it  must demonstrate our power.  Two works were damaged (Olga Froelich's  and Donna Hagerman's). Why were they still  hung? The title cards contained minimal  information. Masks (notably Doreen Jensen's and Frieda Diesing's) were hanging  at such awkward angles that I was forced  to kneel to see them properly. (I suppose there's an artistic statement in  there somewhere.)  There are other points worth mentioning.  There was a continual slide show in the  exhibition space. When I was there, slides  were in backwards. The works shown were  not attributed to any artist. Some of the  slides were of work represented in the  exhibition. Some of them were not. Again,  I could not decipher the reasoning.  tfy next criticism deals with an aspect I  did not see. Publicity. I saw the poster  for the exhibition after I had seen the  exhibition. (And I had looked for it.)  There was no mention of the festival in  the papers that I could find, or reviews.  Why didn't the organizers inundate the  public with information saying that the  exhibition was happening?  In conclusion, I feel we must exhibit work  by women artists more often. But when  doing so, we have to find ways to enhance  the work, to show undeniably the power of  the images. We must celebrate our creativity and realize that the artwork made by  B.C. women, on the whole, is of international calibre.  If we are going to hail something as a  celebration, then let us make sure that  it does, indeed, demonstrate our power. September 1982   Kinesis    15  REVIEW  Hosanna explores role model search  Gays, women, Quebec all seek a cultural identity  by Joan Woodward  Michel Tremblay is a highly reputed Quebecois playwright whose work is only beginning to be known in English Canada.  While he may not recognize it as such, his  work is profoundly feminist. The message  he drives home again and again is that  woman is the future of man. Not surprisingly then, most of his major characters  are women. Hosanna,   exceptionally, is a  play about two men.  The first, Hosanna, very convincingly  played by Michael Keller, is one of the  biggest queens in Montreal. The second,  Cuirette, the little queer in leather, is  her lover. The play opens on Hosanna's  arrival back, in the wee hours of the  morning, to their tacky little east end  apartment. She has just been disgraced  at the local drag club, and is on the  verge of tears. A few minutes later,  Cuirette roars up on his motorbike with  the clear intention of throwing salt on  the wound.  Through the course of the play, Hosanna  realizes the absurdity of trying to model  himself after Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra. For the transexual there are no  role models. "I'm not just stupide," she  exclaims, "I am ree-deeculous!"  That there are no role models is certainly reality for today's transexual. The.  Comedy  illustrates  changing  forms of  oppression  by Joan Woodward  Love Among the Women  is a comedy by  well-known feminist author, Fay Weldon.  The deep sense of irony behind this title  becomes more and more apparent as the play  unfolds.  The main characters in the play are three  young women sharing a grubby little London  flat in the late 195C's, and surviving on  grants in order to attend university. All  three are in competition with one another,  although each has very different aims in  life.  While one dreams of babies and domesticity,  another's principal goal in life is to  find a rich husband. A third rebels against  conventional morality by opting for an  Shunned by his peers, Tremblay's Hosanna;  competing with theirs:  Weldon's Women  independent life and a career in the BBC.  To a certain degree, each woman succeeds  in attaining her goals, but at such a  price! by the mere fact of being women,  all three are equally oppressed; they have  only succeeded in choosing the form of  their oppression.  Character development proceeds very subtly  through the play. A reminder once again  that feminist consciousness doesn't come  over night, and that we must look for small  changes. This is as true for the male  characters as it is for the female.

He in particular, is barred from  success in any of the traditional male  fields much as a woman would be. Unless  his aspirations are in the fields of hair-  dressing or music, he is out of luck.  While the transexual female may have the  edge on her sisters for her ability to  emulate male behaviours and attitudes in  the workplace, and for not posing a direct  sexual threat to her male co-workers and  bosses, the transexual male can never find  even an asexual acceptance.  Perhaps this is why Tremblay has chosen  the male, and not the female transexual,  as the epitome of the soul deprived of  its identity. This is not a play that was  written only for men or only for homosexuals. It was written for all of us.  As women we understand the need for worthwhile role models, and the disastrous  effects of either not having any, or  choosing bad ones. Within the framework  of Quebecois nationalism, Hosanna  takes  on yet another dimension. That of the  struggle for a cultural identity which  is modeled neither after the Americans  nor after the European French.  Although this was not a professional production, it's an excellent peice of political theatre. Like all Tremblay's plays,  it is worth catching if you get another  chance.  Hosanna, directed by Catherine Caines,  was presented by Studio 58 at the Langara  Campus of Vancouver Community College.  the playwright uses to illustrate these  gradual changes in attitude is the immediate repetition of portions of scenes,  instant replay if you like, in order to  show how things can be remembered differently by different people.  Another device she uses to illustrate that  the problem lies in society and not in  personal weaknesses in her characters, is  the "what if" approach. What if a different  mate had been chosen? What if certain  facts had not been revealed? What if others  had been revealed? By experimenting with  these possibilities she shows us that the  outcome is always the same.  All of this could be quite depressing if  it were not for her ever present, and very  British, satirical wit. People are invited  to laugh at themselves, and the message is  conveyed.  A very polished production by City Stage  of a play well worth seeing. 16   Kinesis   September 1982  INTERNATIONAL  THE PALESTINIANS:  Don't say you  did not know  by Robin Barnett and Marion Kawas  Imagine living in a tent. Not for a month.  But for years. Maybe even your whole life  if you are under 25. Imagine having nothing but a few personal possessions that  move with you as you have to move your  tent. If you are the woman of the family  you will be responsible for getting water,  walking distances and waiting in lines  at the water source.  This is the situation of people without  land, without homes. These people are  refugees. Palestinians are the largest  group of refugees in the world. There  are two and a half million Palestinians  throughout the Middle East (Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia)  and the West. There are four million Palestinians in the world. The rest live in  Israel and on the occupied West Bank and  Gaza strip.  With the invasion of Lebanon in June,  1982, the refugees in southern Lebanon  had to move. Some now live in parks in  Sidon. Some moved east toward the Bekka  Valley. Others walked or squashed into  cars and trucks and made their way to  Beirut. In Beirut they live in basements,  schools, and buildings under construction. The Israelis control the entry of  food and water. Most everyone has someone (friend or relative) who has been  killed or injured.  Women are the main workers in the medical network, the Red Crescent.  They are  trying to deal with the masses of injured,  dead and diseased.  It is only with the horrors of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon that we in  Canada are beginning to get information  in the media about who the Palestinian  people are. From the beginning of the  proposal for the state of Israel in the  early twentieth centurey, we in North  America, have been led to believe that  Palestine had been a land without people,  a wasteland, a cultural vacuum. Golda  Meier, an ex-prime minister of Israel,  was quoted as saying, "Palestinians,  there was no such thing as Palestinians."  We were brought up to believe that the  Israelis made the desert bloom and that  the "Arabs" are poor, uneducated and  backward. Palestinians are described as  "terrorists" and have been reduced to  people of inhuman proportions. We are  never actually told what they really  believe or do.  Palestine is the home of some of the  oldest civilizations. When the Zionists  came to Palestine there was a thriving  economy, towns, orchards, a culture—  a Palestinian way of life. It was not  an industrialized country with lots of  Western capital. The Palestinians are  Arabs, 7555 Moslems and 25%  Christians.  In November of 194?,  the United Nations  approved the Partition Plan which divided Palestine into a Jewish state and an  Arab state. This action was done without  any consultation with the Palestinians.  The Partition Plan allotted 43$ of the  land to the Arab state and 51%  to the  Jewish state, even though the Palestinians  comprised two-thirds of the population,  and Jewish ownership of land was no more  than 5.6% of the total area of Palestine.  Between November, 194-7, and the establishment of the state of Israel in May, 1948,  the Zionists forced Palestinians to flee  from their homes in order to expand the  boundaries of the area that had been set  out for the state of Israel. The most  infamous incident of this campaign was  the massacre at the village of Deir Yassin  in April, 1948, in which 254 men, women  ' and children were killed. The terrorist  Irgun gang, of which Prime Minister Begin  was then leader, participated in this  massacre.  Begin, in his book The Revolt,  glorified  the Deir Yassim massacre and spoke of how  it was a decisive factor in the creation  of Israel. The final result of these  actions was that by the end of 1948,  Israel occupied 80%  of the area of Palestine and had uprooted and dispossessed  two-thirds of the Palestinians. Many of  those who left from the Galilee settled  in southern Lebanon.  The Zionists were intent on building an  "exclusive Jewish state". This meant not  only driving out most of the indigenous  population but also changing the whole  landscape and social fabric of what had  once been Palestine. Hundreds of villages  were bulldozed and new Zionist settlements  were built in their place.  Laws were put in effect that facilitated  Zionist expropriation of the land owned  UN PETITION PUN  UBANON /  |  l'l                       \  ^  ir~\  by those Palestinians who remained.  Seventy percent of the land belonging to  the Palestinians who live in Israel has  been confiscated. The Law of Return was  enacted. This granted Israeli citizenship  to any Jew the moment s/he landed in  Israel, but denied the right of return to  Palestinians.  Since the creation of the Zionist state,  expansion by aggressive means continues  to be one of Israel's main characteristics. The wars of 1956, 1967, 1973 and  the current invasion of Lebanon have all  resulted in occupation of more Palestinian and Arab territory. In 1967, Israel  occupied the rest of Palestine (West Bank  and Gaza), parts of Syria and Egypt. This  war not only created hundreds of thousands  of additional refugees, but also brought  over a million more Palestinians under  Israeli military rule.  Palestinians living in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip are denied the most elementary  human and civil rights including free  expression and the right to form their  own political organizations. Recently,  the Israelis have dismissed democratically  elected mayors and municipal councils on  the West Bank and have killed at least a  dozen people, mostly teenagers, during   demonstrations against the Israeli occupation. Deportation, imprisonment and  torture are all documented Israeli practices.  Palestinian workers in the occupied terri-  are used as cheap labour for the most  menial jobs. They are not only paid less  than Israeli workers, but have deductions  for social welfare benefits which they  never receive. In addition, the Israeli  authorities try to squash the cultural  identity and heritage of the Palestinians.  Bir Zeit University, which refuses to  collaborate with the Israelis, is under  constant harassment. During the last year  the Israelis have closed it down more  than it has been open.  From 1948 to 1965, the Palestinians have  waited for the U.N. and world public  opinion to alleviate their plight, with  with no results. In 1965, they took up  arms as the only course left open to them  to achieve their legitimate national and  human rights. These include the right of  return, the right to self-determination,  and the right to establish an independent  state in their homeland. The Palestinians  do not want to drive the "Jews into the  sea". They are willing to live in peace  and equality with all the people of that  area in a democratic secular state with  freedom for all religions.  What, then, is the PLO? The PLO is a complex organization with an array of economic, social, political and military functions. In order to articulate a national  political consensus from so many countries  ?0:>T-i?4g AGGRESSION  POST 19*7 AGGIKSilON  the PLO evolved democratic, representative  structures and procedures. The Palestine  National Council (PNC) was created to  serve as a Palestine Parliament in exile.  The PNC, the hightest policy-making body  in the PLO is composed of representatives  of the Palestinian communities such as  women, students and workers. It gives  proportional representation to all Palestinian political tendencies as well as  independents. The PNC elects an Executive  Committee which is responsible for the  implementation of PNC-approved policy  and international representation. The  Executive Committee is chaired by Yasser  Arafat.  The PLO supports popular organizations  like trade unions, women's and students  associations and professional organizations. The largest and most efficient  health and welfare program in the Arab  world exists within the Palestinian community including responsibility for the  refugees. The PLO built schools, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics, factories  and publishing houses. It provides health  insurance, student scholarships, vocational training and welfare assistance.  The bulk of these socio-economic institu-  tions exist in Lebanon and are open to September 1982   Kinesis    17  INTERNATIONAL  the Lebanese poor. It is these institutions that Israel has in mind when it says  that the purpose of its invasion is to  destroy not only the PLO military establishment, but also the PLO "infrastructure". They accuse the PLO of hiding in  the civilian population of Beirut, but it  is really these community facilities that  are the Israeli targets. It should be  remembered that the PLO strictly adhered  to the ceasefire on the Lebanese border  since July, 1981, while Israel has repeatedly violated Lebanese air space and  waters.  The Palestinian government in exile has  its military arm, the Palestine Liberation  Army, which fought regular engagements in  1967, 1973, and 1978. There are also eight  guerilla groups in the PLO who carry out  armed struggle against Israel.  All Palestinians recognize the PLO as  their representative government. This  includes the inhabitants of the West Bank  and Gaza Strip, those living in Israel,  and the two and a half million people  throughout the Middle East and Western  countries.  It is not a coincidence that Israel is  closely allied with countries like the  U.S., South Africa, El Salvador and Chile.  In El Salvador, Israeli experts train  Salvadorean government troops in anti-  guerilla techniques. Israel was Somoza's  main weapons supplier in Nicaragua. Israel  and South Africa carry out joint military  operations and use the same missile system which is capable of carrying nuclear  weapons. They exploded a nuclear bomb  together off the coast of South Africa  in 1980. South Africa is presently invading Angola, Honduras is invading Nicaragua and Israel is in Lebanon. These  actions support the Reagan policy of trying to reassert American hegemony in the  world.  Israel has ideological and mateiral needs  for part of Lebanon. The Herut Party, of  which Begin remains chairman, defines  ancient "Eretz Israel" as extending well  into Lebanon. The Zionist proposal for a  state in 1919 mapped Israel to include  Sidon as well as part of Jordan. Materially, Israel needs more water. It already  uses 100% of its fresh water and this  water reportedly is becoming saline.  Israeli Defense Minister Sharon has pub-  lically said that Israel is now a "superpower". There is an article in a theoretical Zionist journal which lays out a  "grand plan" for the Middle East. This  gives Lebanon north of the Litani River  to the control of the Phalange Party.  Jordan would become the Palestinian state  and the other countries such as Syria,  Iraq and Egypt would be "re-balanced".  The 1975-76 Lebanese civil war was a re-  sult of severe economic and political   divisions within Lebanese society. Those  same tensions and turmoil remain today.  There are an estimated three million  Lebanese. They are of mixed ethnic origin  and different Christian and Moslem denominations, but are culturally and linguistically Arab. The left parties are grouped  in a coalition known as the Lebanese  National Movement. The LNM supports the  PLO. The parties of the LMN include leaders and members from all religious groups.  The parties of the right, all Maronite  Christian, are grouped the Lebanese Front.  One party dominates this coalition, the  Phalange.  The Phalange began in 1936 in fascist  Spain and remains a fanatic neo-Nazi  group. The Front/Phalange controlled 20%  of Lebanese territory until the Israeli  invasion. It is Western and Israeli propaganda which' seeks to describe the differences in Lebanon as religious. They  are political.  In Southern Lebanon most Palestinian men  and boys over 14 have been taken prisoner.  No one knows where they have been taken.  There are mostly women and children in  the remaining refugee areas. Daily in  Sidon women demonstrate outside Israeli  headquarters demanding to know the whereabouts of the men. In some areas Palestinians have been made to wear white  crosses on their backs to distinguish  them from the Lebanese. To make refugee  problems worse, the shamble of buildings  in the Palestinian camps have been bulldozed.  The unique political situation of the  Palestinian people has had a profound impact on all aspects of Palestinian social  relations and especially on the role of  women. The uprooting of the Palestinians  has tended to break down old traditions  for reasons of basic survival and economic necessity. When a Palestinian family  became refugees, the whole economic base  of the family was shattered. Women had to  work outside the home, married or unmarried, in order to provide a family income.  Education became important for both girls  and boys as a means of improving the  family's situation.  In the 1920's, women began participating  in the resistance by holding demonstrations in Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. They  were also active in forming boycotts of  Zionist merchants. Another form of women's  resistance was to sing traditional songs  and maintain their existence as an integral part of the Palestinian people's culture. These songs were often sung by the  educational facilities, nurseries and  childcare centres.  After 1967, women began to participate in  the struggle throughout the occupied territories. They helped close schools, factories and held demonstrations. Many  women were severely beaten by Israeli  soldiers. Another form of struggle was to  stage sit-ins demanding the release of the  thousands of political prisoners held in  Israeli jails. Women then became active  in communicating with the international  community. Many women have been arrested  because they have been "suspected" of  being a "threat to the state".  Women are increasing their involvement as  each new set of events reaffirms the fact  that the survival of the Palestinian  people as a nation depends on the full  utilization of their human resources. This  process was most evident in Lebanon during  and after the civil war and certainly  again at this moment. In the civil war  women began taking on the work of antiaircraft gun crews and were integrated  into more units of guerilla groups.  It is notable that in 1975, the Palestinian women's delegation to the International Women's Conference in Mexico City succeeded in getting the first anti-Zionist  resolution approved by an international  gathering. At the Copenhagen International Women's Conference in 1980, the Third  World Women's statement included support  for Palestinian self-determination and  the PLO.  The liberation of Palestinian women is  inseparable from the liberation of the  Palestinian people as a nation. What can  equality mean for women when they have no  land on which to develop a society? It is  in this context that Palestinian women  fight against their oppression.  In an interview in the late 1970's Mayada  Youssef, member of the executive of GUPW  and responsible for the Red Crescent,  talked about the problem of women with  their parents:  A major problem in our country and  throughout the Arab world is the relationship between a daughter and her parents.  She faces specific problems surrounding  her freedom to leave the home and problems which arise out of school and work.  Parents often do not want their daughter  to leave the home too often and this  makes it difficult for her to participate  in the struggle.  When a girl becomes a militant she takes  on many responsibilities such as attend-  "The consciousness of the older women is being raised also  these women do important work in terms of preserving our  culture and heritage."   women during demonstrations. Women also  carried food to commandos and surveyed  battlefields before a confrontation.  In 1936, women students began a strike  which was not only the longest in Palestinian history but which shut down the  country for six months. In this period  women were also transporting arms, collecting money and politicizing other  women. Women participated in the struggle  against partition with demonstrations,  medical work and armed struggle.  On August 29, 1965, the General Union of  Palestinian Women was formed. One of  their aims is to mobilize the Palestinian  woman to participate in the struggle for  national liberation and to defend her  "material and moral interests by trying  to improve her social, cultural, vocational and living standards in general".  Some of the programs of GUPW are literacy  classes, collective workshops to promote  economic independence, martial arts and  military training and the development of  ing training sessions or meetings and  finds that she must be away for many days.  ...Often her parents may be quite nationalistic with her father and brother participating actively in the struggle.   Yet  they may still be opposed to her participation because they have traditional  attitudes towards women and girls.  One way of dealing with this problem is  for us to go and visit the parents and  try to make them understand.  The women  militants are important in this respect  because they set an example in the camps  for the parents to measure...We also help  the girls in showing them how to deal with  their parents.  The consiousness of the older women is  being raised also...These women do important work in terms of preserving our culture and heritage. They record the traditional songs and make the liandicrafts of  our people. They teach the younger women  these skills so that our culture may be  preserved. 18   Kinesis   September 1982  INTERNATIONAL  Conference for unity in diversity  Salvadorean tour  rescheduled  A cross-Canada tour by a representative  of AMES (Association de las Mujeres de  El Salvador—Salvadorean Women's Association), originally planned for the spring,  has now been re-scheduled for the coming  fall.  The AMES representative will begin her  tour in B.C. during the week of Oct. 12.  Interest in the tour has been expressed  by women's and community organizations  across the province, including Vancouver,  Victoria, Courtney, Denman Island, Port  Hardy, Terrace, Prince Rupert, Kitimat,  and the Queen Charlotte Islands. From  B.C. the tour will proceed to Alberta and  points east. (For final dates for the  tour, see next month's Kinesis. )  The purpose of the tour is two-fold: to  educate Canadian women and men on the  particular conditions facing Salvadorean  women and to discuss the role of women in  the Salvadorean struggle.  Money still needs to be raised to cover  the costs of the tour - about $2000 for  travel plus auxiliary expenses. Any additional funds raised during the tour itself will go directly to support AMES  projects such as child care centres and  an educational centre for women.

Nuns group supports  choice  The National Coalition of American Nuns  has opposed efforts of Roman Catholic  bishops to overturn the 1972 US. Supreme  Court decision allowing abortion.  "We're against any bill or amendment  about it, and consider it a matter of  conscientious moral choice for women to  make," said Sister Donna Quinn of Chicago,  president of the organization.  Rev. Edward Bryce, director of the US.  bishops' pro-life activities office,  called the nuns' position "misguided and  certainly no comfort to the unborn child."  The nuns' organization expressed continuing opposition to abortion, but opposed  a proposed amendment, which the bishops  favor to upset the court's stand.  The amendment would give the U.S. Congress  authority to put restrictions on abortion  and allow individual states to add their  own further restrictions.  Sister Quinn said the nuns' group firmly  opposed abortion as "a means of birth  control, or on demand, on a wholesale  basis." But she said it should remain  "within the realm of women's morals and  consequences to make the choice."  The Globe & Mail  by Cy-Thea Sand  A Report on the National Women's Studies  Association Conference,  Humboldt State  University,  Areata,  California,  held  June  16-20,   1982.  The NWSA Conference, which I attended as  an editor and representative of The Radical Reviewer,  was a clear attempt to  bridge the academic and activist elements  of the women's movement in its' overall  perspective. Throughout the conference  there were continuing references to the  need for feminist academics to view their  communities as a source  of theory rather  than as objects of theoretical constructs.  Dorothy Smith, of the Ontario Institute  for Studies in Education (OISE), spoke of  research moving out of the university as  both a feminist strategy and a way to  confront institutionalized classism and  racism. Vina Mazumdar from the centre for  Women's Development Studies in New Delhi,  emphasized the need for privileged women  to transcend their "arrogance of learning" to build connections with non-elite  women. Wendy Cutler of the University of  Santa Cruz expressed hope that feminist  academics would view research being done  by activist women in the community as  valid and important.  The conference was not without its problems, however. Paula Estey, editor of  Maenad,  wrote a critical description of  the 1981 NWSA conference which can be applied to this one as well: "The atmosphere  reeked of the kind of scheduling techniques true schools of patriarchy relish."  There were three one and a half hour sessions per day, with twenty-two seminar  choices per time slot. In addition, there  students feel in college and of her disgust with middle class academics' concern  with money rather than with people.  Nellie Wong, Asian/American poet and activist, spoke of her disappointment in  not being able to go to college due to  lack of financial support. Nellie has  worked as a secretary for more than 30  years while writing her poetry. Her talk:  "What is a Nice Secretary Like You Doing  in Politics Like This?" emphasized the  necessity for grass roots movements to  interweave the struggles against classism,  racism, sexism, homophobia and imperialism.  Merle Woo is another major voice of the  Asian/ American women's movement. She has  been fired as a lecturer in Asian American studies at the University of California at Berkeley. As an outspoken lesbian  fominist activist, Merle is a target for  the selectively applied rule which states  that lecturers may only teach for four  years. This rule is being applied to lecturers who are challenging the status quo.  Merle was one of the many "fired feminists" who met at the conference to share  their experiences and discuss strategies  for fighting back.  This workshop, as a whole, spoke to the  anti-academic tone of the women's movement that has concerned me for some time.  This tone reflects, too often, the middle  class make-up of the feminist movement  to date. Certainly it is easier to denigrate a privilege you were expected to  embrace, but for working class people,  women, and people of colour, higher education is often the ticket out of limited  opportunity. Academia must be broadened  and enriched rather than dismissed as  elitist and irrelevant.  "It is easier to denigrate a privilege you were expected to embrace, but for many, higher education is a ticket out of limited  opportunity."  There is a trend across American campuses  to fire part-time lecturers who are mainly women and people of colour. Feminists  are being denied tenure in numerous universities across the United States. In  B.C., women's studies programs are always  fighting to survive. The powers-that-be  understand that a united force of community and academic activists would help  to shake the system down. The NWSA Conference 's emphasis on the linking of  community and academic work addressed a  vital front for the progressive women's  movement of the 1980's.  The need for unity within a diversified  women's movement was often reiterated  during the conference. Angela Davies insisted that women's liberation become a  multi-racial movement and that it become  connected to the masses of people. There  were numerous workshops on unlearning  racism and on issues around classism. A  strong lesbian presence was evident, with  dialogues between heterosexual women and  lesbians. I left with a sense that the  women's movement is growing up—beginning  to grow from both within and without.  There is much work to be done. I think  that educational networking is a crucial  part of that labour.  Some of the titles discusses in this workshop include: The Third Life of Grange  Copeland by Alice Walker, Rainbow Jordan  by Alice Childress (a young adult novel),  The Breadgivers  by Anzia Yesierska, and  Daughter of the Earth  by Agnes Smedley.  were four plenary sessions, caucus meetings, ad hoc group/committee meetings,  an on-going book exhibit- and readings,  films, art shows and concerts. Clearly  the conference suffered from information  overload.  Little or no discussion time was left at  the end of workshops. The depth of commitment, vibrance and intellectual clarity of individual speakers compensated,  in part, for the audience's lack of par-  ticipiation, but I think feminist conference planners must address the format  of meetings as well as their content.  We need time to respond to new concepts  with questions, statements of clarification and feeling. By encouraging audiences  to speak, we help to break down the middle class model of teacher/student, expert/client, us/them.  The most significant seminar for me was  Working Class Women in Academia. Doris  Davenport, Nellie Wong and Merle Woo gave  me a vision of what academia could become  —a vibrant community of diversity and  progressive thought, not the white male  heterosexist ivory tower that it is.  Doris, a black working class woman, poet,  lesbian and Ph.D. candidate, spoke of her  determination to get the highest academic  honours possible. Her idea for this workshop had been inspired by her own experiences in academia where she and others  from working-class backgrounds were made  to feel they didn't belong. She spoke of  the alienation that so many working class September 1982    Kinesis    19  OPINION  by Suzanne Gerard  Suzanne Gerard is a member of the Women in  Trades Association of B.C.   The Association  shares office space in the Vancouver  Status of Women offices.  The other  morning    I    lost  my  temper.  walked into a Payless drug store on  Renfrew Street, turned left at the cash  register and there, in their own little  green stand, set apart and in front of  the other magazines, was an assortment of  pornographic magazines. Usually I would  have turned away and gone on with my shopping, but that morning was different. I  had seen Not a Love Story  the previous  week. I was more aware and less accepting.  I walked over to the rack, which was waist  level, the height of a small child. On  one magazine a woman's legs were stretched so wide I thought she would split.  Another magazine was advertised as  "erotic". I picked it up and the first  picture I saw was a woman, bound and  gagged. A man was standing in front of  her holding a whip.  I swallowed my stomach and took the magazine to the woman behind the counter who  laughed at me when I asked: "Why did you  order this garbage, and why is it at a  child's eye level, with a grade school  just down the street?" My voice was rising  as I asked her how she would enjoy being  beaten and raped, something these magazines glorify.  She concentrated on her order form while  I felt helpless and enraged. I yelled at  her, "Don't you understand these books  suggest it's O.K. to sexually use children.'" She sighed and shook her head. At  that moment a man poked his head around  the far aisle and looked at me. He turned  his back, unfortunately facing the very  magazines I was ranting about. "Look!",  I shouted, waving the magazine at him.  "There's another future pervert." I  dropped the magazine on the floor and  walked out.  I don't remember driving to the office  that morning. I recounted the incident to  one of the VSW staff but the point didn't  quite come across. I wanted every woman in  hearing distance to volunteer to go back  with me and scatter the magazines all over  the streets; to plaster a sign saying  Payless Drugs Encourages the Sexual Abuse  of Women,  and to write letters to the  owner of the store. But I didn't say that.  Nor did I say how beaten down I felt. Here  was the one refuge for support and understanding I could rely on and I didn't say  a word.  I walked down the hall to the Women in  Trades office and plunked my briefacse down  on the door we use for a desk and sunk in  to a chair. Kinesis  was on the desk. "I  won't deal with this right now", I thought  "I'll read for a while". I read Kate Braid's  article on the woman deckhand. Well done,  I thought, and made a mental note to congratulate her at the next Women in Trades  meeting. I felt better. I turned a few  more pages and saw "Lesbian S/M". My heart  sank. "Oh, God no," I thought as I read it.  What was the point of the morning's onesided battle when women were now choosing  to use porn propaganda on themselves.  I felt like crying. The article used the  same technique the magazines use. The  subtle suggestion that the unacceptable  is acceptable, that victimization, humiliation and degradation of women is okay.  Pain inflicted on women by women is okay.  7T-  WINNIN  July 8/82  Hilarie and I went into a 7-Eleven store  on East Hastings Street. Forum magazine  was directly in front of the cash register.  I loudly read out the contents of the book  described on the cover. Hilarie showed the  book to the man behind the counter and  told him she found the book very offensive.  The man agreed. The magazine remains on  display, even though Hilarie and I have  repeatedly gone back and complained.  July 9/82  I was threatened with forcible removal  from a London Drugs. I was looking for a  book. Penthouse  was right beside the  books.I was interested in. I grabbed the  magazine intending to throw it over my  shoulder, when it opened in my hands to a  picture of a gigantic fly imbedded between  the nude spread legs of a woman. I was  furious. I took the magazine to the nearest salesperson and I showed her the picture demanding to see the manager. She  said: "Why are you reading it?"  Temporarily non-plussed, I just stared at  her. When the manager arrived I showed  the picture to him and accused him of  being responsible for promoting pornographic hate magazines He said it offended him that I would flash the picture in  his face. A man listening yelled over,  "I'm not, I like it". I pointed my finger  at him and yelled, "I'll remember you on  the streets, you pervert!" The manager  then threatened me with forcible removal  if I didn't leave because I offended one  of his customers.  July 24/82  I asked my 17 year-old son if he would  volunteer to buy 3 porn books from the  same London Drug store. There is no age  limit in the Criminal Code of Canada for  buying pornography. He reluctantly agreed.  We stood at the rack and looked through  a few of the magazines. My son turned to  me and said he didn't want to look through  any more because he was getting sick to  his stomach. "You're not alone," I told  him, "there is a group of men called the  Masculine Collective Against Sexism who  submitted a brief stating how they resented being brought up to believe (through  pornographic propaganda) a pack of dangerous lies about how women should be  treated."  I picked out the books and as I watched he  paid for them with no one saying a word  to him. On the way home he said that some  of the material in magazines for his age  group were "sorta rough" too. I wanted to  know what this meant and he showed me a  copy of the August issue of Heavy Metal  and of National Lampoon.  They contained  the following examples:  Heavy Metal  #A nude woman is bent over, her ankles are  being firmly held by an ape as he anally  uses her. She is depicted as having a  smile on her face. (p.30)  *A nude woman is face down on a food  platter, her mouth is gagged, her thighs  and ankles are tied together forcing her  buttock in the air. (p.49)  *A nude female child is mated with a cat,  producing off-spring with both characteristics, (p.58)  National Lampoon  *The cover of National Lampoon shows a  nude woman sectioned for butchering like  a side of beef.  *An unnumbered page shows a woman lying  face down on a bar, her legs spread, her  underwear hanging on one leg, as men putt  golf balls into her.  #Article entitled "Pretend rape, using it  to get what you want from older men".  ^Cartoon story about Jake Donovan and his  adopted nephew Bimbi, in the form of  gazelles. Bimbi is held down by his uncle  and raped by a hyena. On the following  page the uncle anally forces himself on  the nephew.  /   asked   my  son    the    difference      between      his  books and the ones we had just bought. He  said the art work was really great, and  that everyone knew the stories were just  jokes. Do they? An important rule of propaganda is to constantly bombard the mind  with the same theme and soon the unacceptable becomes acceptable.  Of the other three magazines we purchased  the following is excerpted:  Penthouse,  August, 1982  *A woman with her lower clothing removed,  a gigantic fly imbedded between her spread  legs. (p.41)  #A male voyeur is holding a gun on two  women demanding they put on a sexual performance for him. (p.122)  *A series of photos under the heading  "Joys of Sexual Surrender". The theme is  dominance, S/M, submission, mutilation  and bondage.

In the past three months  30,000 Lebanese and Palestinians have been  killed, many more wounded, 10,000 lost and  900,000 made refugees. (UNICEF)  Three major Lebanese cities have been  levelled: Tyre, Sidon and Nabatiyeh. Hospitals, schools, road and electrical systems have been targetted and devastated  by Israeli bombs.  The targets in this war have been civilian  targets and the casualties-children, women  and men. This massive air, land and sea  bombardment is not a war of self-defense  on the part of Israel, but an all-out  assault on the Lebanese and Palestinian  peoples.  -'ñ†For the first time in history, Israelis  themselves are resisting a war. Some 70-  100,000 citizens demonstrated in the  streets of Tel Aviv in late July and found  army guns trained on them. (CBC,   Vancouver  Sun)  Three hundred Israeli soldiers refused to serve in Lebanon, risking court-  martial, and many more petitioned against  fighting in this war. Mainstream religious  leaders and Jewish communities in North  America have withdrawn their support for  Israel's invasion of Lebanon.  As feminists and Jews we call on all women  to speak out against the continuation of  this war by Israel, to call for the immediate withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon,  and to contact the Israeli embassy with  this demand. We ask you to write to your  MPs and Mark McGuigan, External Affairs,  Ottawa, calling for Canada to actively  take this stance and to call for sanctions  to be imposed against Israel.  We ask that you join in protests against  this war. Money is desperately needed for  medical supplies in West Beirut.

Sharelle  Judith Neamtan  Claire Culhane  Marnie Maser  Palestine was destroyed  This letter is in response to the article  "Israel Offers Jews the Means for Self-  Determination" by Marsha Ablowitz.  I can sympathize with the response of Jews  to persecution and genocide, not just in  Nazi Germany but throughout history, who  want to create a homeland where they can  be safer from anti-semitism. What bothers  me about the views expressed by Marsha is  the near-total invisibility and lack of  understanding for the Palestinian Arabs  who were killed or forced out of Palestine  in order to make possible the creation of  the state of Israel.  It has only been in the last couple of  years that I learned that Palestine existed, (other than at the time of Moses and  Jesus), and as recently as 34 years ago.  In religious studies in school, there was  Palestine on the map and moving right  along to geography class, there was Israel,  unquestioned in the atlas like it had been  there forever. As I was not encouraged to  actually think in school, I didn't question this inconsistency.  The factors that lead to my own ignorance  and that of other peoples' ignorance  angers me. When I see examples of a people:  race or sex made invisible or information  buried or distorted so that I live in a  world of lies and fabrication, I am also  angry.  Marsha's article demonstrates the process  of making a people invisible and nonexistent. She ignores them. In the paragraph :  "The only country that will always take  Jewish refugees is Israel. And before  1948, Israel did not exist. It was the  Zionist movement that created the State  of Israel as a refuge for Jewish people."  Israel didn't spring out of nowhere. The  Zionist movement created the State of Israel by destroying the Stateof Palest!:  So what happened to the thousands of Palestinian Arabs and Jews who lived in this  country?  In order to make a people non-existent and  to take away their claim to their homeland it helps to change the name of that  country. So while Sephardic Jews native to  Palestine become Israeli, Palestinian Arabs  must also become Israeli-or "refugees, or  "PLO terrorists". In Israel, Palestinian  Arabs are not allowed to call themselves  Palestinians but neither do they have the  full rights of Israeli Jews.  Should we support self-determination for  Israel and self-defense of Israel against  the PLO? This turn of the tables upholds  self-determination and self-defense of one  group of people at the expense of the same  principles for another group of people.  For a specific example of how this process  of making a people non-existent works look  at Zionist propaganda around agriculture.  They would have us believe that Palestine  was all desert and swamps and it was only  after the European Jewish settlers arrived  that the "deserts bloomed".  Whatever agricultural achievements there  have been over the past 30 years (not forgetting the U.S. dollars and technological  asssitance that contributed to it), or  whatever type of terrain Palestine consisted of, nonetheless millions of people  have lived off this land and made it their  home for centuries, in line with their own  methods. Numerous Israeli towns, villages,  orchards and farms are located on the sites  of their Palestinian counterparts.  As a non-Jewish, white person I see the  dangers of criticizing Zionism because it  can feed into anti-semetic,racist zeal.  The situation in the Middle East is complex. (For instance, Palestine prior to  1948 was no haven of independence for  Palestinians, being under the control of  Britain, and before that, the Turkish  Ottoman). Solutions are at best compromises and never redress the wrongs done to  a people whether Aboriginal Canadians,  European Jews or Palestinian Arabs. Justice  in this world is scarce and hard-won but  it cannot come through injustice to  another people.  Marsha suggests we look in more detail at  the situation of Jewish women in Canada  and Israeli women in the Middle East. Obviously everything can profit by being  looked at in more detail-in this case let's  not forget Palestinian women. And right  now, let's look in more detail at Beirut.  With the tens of thousands of Jews in  Israel and People throughout the world  let's protest the Israeli army's invasion  of Lebanon and continued killing of Palestinian and Lebanese people.  Diana Smith  Jews Against Zionism  Kinesis:  We were pleased to read the two articles  on Zionism which were published in 'the  July/August issue of Kinesis.  We think it  is important that this questions is being  discussed amongst feminists.  However, we have important disagreements  with both of these articles and continue  to feel that it is important for progressive women to take a clear anti-Zionist  stand.  Jews Against Zionism will be holding a  public meeting on September 15 at 7:30 at  the First United Church (320 Hastings).  This meeting will deal with the question  of anti-Semitism and Zionism. We want to  examine the character of anti-Semitism  (prejudice against Semitic peoples which  includes both Jews and Arabs). We will  explain why we feel that Zionism is not a  defense against anti-Semitism. We urge the  signers of both of the articles on Zionism  to attend this meeting and participate in  the discussion so that we can have open  and public debate. Other people who are  interested in this topic are urged to  attend the meeting.  Chavah Helen Mintz for  Jews Against Zionism  Group fights racism  To All Women's Groups in the Lower Mainland:  Given the confusion and strong feelings  surrounding the Israeli States invasion of  Lebanon, members of Women Against Imperialism are willing to come to your group to  discuss Zionism, Anti-Semitism, the position of-the Palestinian people and the  present situation in Lebanon.

Contact: Karen or Diana at 253-5654  S&M sex perpetuates  patriarchal attitudes  Kinesis:  I hesitate to add more words to the debate  on lesbian sado-masochistic practice and  feminism which has been going on for years.  I do not want the issue to be used to divide women into hostile camps, but I do  want to make some points that are not  usually brought into the discussion.  We should be aware that the images of sadomasochism, bondage, pain and powerlessness  have a special significance for those  whose ancestors were brought to the Americas as real slaves in real bonds  and who  today still bear the psychic scars of  their heritage. Whips and chains and bonds  are symbols of a time in quite recent  history when they were used to keep people  in slavery against their will. To choose  to turn the images of slavery and bondage  into a sex game and to use the symbols of  continued on page 21 September 1982   Kinesis   21  LETTERS  slavery as sex toys shows a real ignorance  of what bondage and powerlessness have  meant in the lives of people who had no  choice, and trivializes the history and  experience not only of black women in the  Americas but of women all over the world  who even today live in conditions of  slavery.  I do not offer these thoughts as abstract  ideas. My great great grandmother was the  daughter of a slave whose ancestors were  brought to the West Indies in chains from  Africa. I imagine the neo-Nazi overtones  sometimes brought into s/m must be as  disturbing and offensive to Jewish women  as the symbols of slavery being connected  with sexuality and feminism are to me.  For a work of fiction which splendidly  elucidates the point I am trying to make,  see A Letter of the Times  by Alice Walker  in Ms.  magazine, October 1981.  To respond specifically to a point in  Susan White's article in the last Kinesis:  White seems to assume that anything women  do is intrinsically harmless, simply because we are not men. Being female does  not mean that we never operate out of  patriarchal attitudes and values, and in  patriarchal and, like it or not, we have  all internalized patriarchal ways of thinking and being to varying degrees.  We have to scrutinize our own attitudes  and behaviour constantly for sexism just  as we have to do for racist, classist and  heterosexist attitudes. Just because we  are women, and even if we are feminists,  we are not exempt from being capable of  behaviour which perpetrates the patriarchal model, either by being a victim or  by being an oppressor.  Because we say we have a choice in what we  do does not mean that the model of victim/  oppressor is changed. Even black people,  after the end of slavery, were known  occasionally to choose to return to their  masters when it seemed the best of all  possible options. This does not mean it  was an option which was liberating for  them. It was the familiar option and therefore the one which seemed most viable.  The real challenge to lesbians, it seems  to me, is not opt for the familiar model of  power over someone else and compliance to  power, but to risk the uncharted possibilities of love between equals.  Annette Clough  Party in Vancouver?  Dear Kinesis,'  I really enjoyed the recent article by  Frances Rooney titled The Dinner Party, a  Moving Feast (Kinesis, July/Aug. 82).  Just one thing though, there was no mention of whether or not this fabulous-  sounding exhibit would ever be coming to  Vancouver. There is surely the interest  to draw enough numbers of people to make  it a worth while venture. Any chance?  Chris Murphy  Why no BC coverage  for Aminocentesis?  As a concerned mother-to-be at age 36 I  recently made the decision to have an amniocentesis done.  This test, done around the 16th week of  pregnancy, determines whether or not the  child one is carrying has any spinal/neural  defects or Down's Syndrome. As we have all  been told (especially those of us considering having children in our late 30's)  the likelihood of producing children with  such defects increases dramatically past  the age of 35.  I paid over $300 for my amniocentesis to  be done, and recently found that British  Columbia is the only province in Canada  that does not fully fund amniocentesis  testing (though medical plans) for women  age 35 and over. In B.C. a woman must be  38 years old at the time of conception before the test costs will be picked up by  the B.C. Medical plan.  The Canadian College of Medical Geneticists  has guidelines stating that women age 35  and over should have amniocentesis available to them. Professionals in the field  state that amniocentesis has been proven  cost effective for women over age 34. In  other words, it would cost less for the  Ministry of Health to pay for the test  than it presently costs many ministries  to pay for the special health and education costs required for children born with  such defects.  Apparently concerned medical professionals  have been lobbying the Ministry of Health  to change this discriminatory policy for  some time and have not had any positive  results. It is time for those of us who  stand to be directly affected-the parents-  to voice our dissatisfaction to the Ministry of Health. I made the decision to  try and save money for several months to  pay for my test. Many women are not able  to make even that choice and thus cannot  afford amniocentesis.  This policy is discriminatory, counterproductive and not economically realistic.  Write to the Ministry of Health today to  demand that B.C. join the rest of Canada  in providing medical plan funding for  amniocentesis to women age 35 and over.  Diana Ellis  We understand the need for all people's  liberation movements to work together if  we are to spare future generations even  some of the agony that we ourselves have  had to endure in coming to terms with our  own sexuality.  On a more personal note, we would like to  thank Marg Verrall for the timeliness of  her comments. For some time now, we have  been intending to approach the women of  LIL, hoping that dialogue between our  organizations would lead to better, mutual  understanding and support. Marg's letter  in Kinesis  lit a fire under those long-  simmering intentions. We are optimistic  that the results will be nourishing and  encouraging to all concerned, including  the volunteers on both phonelines, and especially to their callers. Thank you, Marg,  Howard Askwith and Elaine Smith  Co-Chairpersons  for the women and men of SEARCH Gay  Community Services  LIL's service essential  Kinesis:  Thank you for providing a copy of the  July/August article in which Margaret  Verrall wrote of her involvement with the  Vancouver Gay Community Centre and the  1981 Gay Unity Week. As the Board of VGCC,  we do not wish to argue with Margaret  about her experiences or the conclusions  she has drawn for herself.  We do want to note that it is only through  the work of all our predecessors on the  Board and the efforts of our members that  we now have a place to share with SEARCH  and the MCC and to make available to other  SEARCH for gay unity  Kinesis:  It was with considerable dismay that we  read, in your July/August issue, Marg  Verrall's article: "Sojourn in the Gay  Movement-An Exercise in Futility". Since  we represent one of the organizations  mentioned in the article, we felt that a  reply was in order.  Although SEARCH does not consider itself  a political organization per se, we are  trying to enhance our understanding of  the oppression of gays in relation to the  oppression of other people, especially  women. For example, earlier this year our  board approved a motion to support a  woman's right of choice on abortion.  Henceforth, SEARCH'S name will appear on  all CCCA publications in support of a  woman's right to control her own body and  her own sexuality.  In regard to the alleged trashing of the  Lesbian Information Line, if such an incident took place, we maintain that the  comments made would have been the responsibility of the individual involved, they  do not represent the views of the organization as a whole.  groups from the lesbian and gay communities,  More, we are now able to plan the sorts of  programs which address the contentious  issues of life-style and politics Margaret  mentions.  It seems important to clarify that VGCC  does not "make pacts with other organizations not to duplicate services". In fact,  our constitution expressly forbids our  designing duplicate services—a way of ensuring that we are not involved in competition with other groups or embroiled in  divisiveness that may empower those people  who would keep lesbians and gays out of  sight.  On the matter of support for the Lesbian  Information Line: In May 1981 the Board  voted to send a letter of support of LIL's  application for funds to the Department of  the Secretary of State;'in June 1982, the  Board sent a letter to the B.C. Human Rights  Commission in support of LIL's application  for a grant. We did this in the belief  that LIL's service is essential to the  lives of lesbians in Vancouver. This is  not a comment on the quality of service  since we have neither mandate nor sufficient information to hazard any judgement.

The caption reads "6.2 million amateur  gynecologists can't be wrong". A woman is  unconscious on an operating table. She is  surgically draped, her legs are exposed  and in stirrups. The three 'amateur gynecologists' are leaning over her reading  Hustler,  one has his hand between her legs,  (p. 100)  Pornography  IS  not       eroti  cism.    If    the    scales  tilt in terms of respect for the human  body and being, and power comes into play  which uses domination, humiliation and the  violent sexual abuse of women, then you  have pornography. Where the underlying  message becomes: "It's okay, they like it",  then you have hate propaganda.  Pornography makes extensive use of propaganda, as shown by J.A.C. Brown in his  book Techniques of Persuasion:  1. Use of stereotypes-creates a fixed, unfavourable idea of the chosen scapegoat.  2. Name substitution-creates a biased  reaction by using derogatory words to describe the scapegoat.  3. Selection-only chosen facts are presented to the public. Rape is a fact, for  example, but the victim and porn consumer  are constantly told: "She'll love it".  Left unsaid is, of course, that rape is  physically and emotionally destructive.  4. Lying-CTric is an expert at this. Witness  the photo portrayal of a woman thrusting a  large kitchen knife into her vagina, with  blood spurting from the wounds. The look  on her face is to be interpreted as one of  sexual ecstasy. Obviously this would cause  severe pain and she would not be smiling.  5. Repetition-by constantly repeating the  message, the abhorrent becomes acceptable.  6. Assertion-this technique is used, not  just to point out an idea but to agress-  ively promote ideas. This is how freedom  of speech can be twisted and abused.  7. Pinpointing the enemy-the enemy in porn  is woman; she must be subdued and vanquished.  8. Appeal to authority-this is a vital step  for porn pushers. They will use quotes  from so-called experts and/or testimonials  from famous people.  Joseph Goebbels said, "The best propaganda  is that which works invisibly, penetrates  the whole of life, without the public  having any knowledge at all of the propagandist initiative."  Data is borrowed from:  Take Back the Night,  edited by Laura  Lederer, William Morrow & Co. New York,  1980.  Pornography,  by Masculine Collective  Against Sexism, Montreal, 1982.  continued from page 21  and men must have places to work together-  not that all must work together all of the  time. We do not pretend that this is easy-  quite the reverse. We struggle with differing opinions influenced by our own experiences and our learned sexism and hetero-  sexism and, as readers of Kinesis  know only  too well, the men are usually the least  well-practised in dealing with the issues.  A women's caucus is being formed to ensure  that attention to issues presented by  lesbians is well maintained.  The Board of VGCC  Margaret Edgar and Tim Agg, Co-Chairs  Men require women for  their own liberation  Kinesis:  As the current co-chairperson, female, of  the Vancouver Gay Community Centre I am  offering my personal response to Margaret  Verrall's "Sojourn in gay movement an  exercise in futility", which appeared in  the last issue of Kinesis.  Marg talks of her experience as being "in  retrospect". It was valid for her in that  context, at that time, almost exactly one  year ago when we were both members of the  Board of the VGCC. Since then, the format  of the meetings has changed somewhat, more  effort is being put into offering programs  of interest to both women and men, and  policies are being formulated to address  many of the criticisms made by Marg.  If, as I think they do, some men behave  arrogantly and more often, thoughtlessly  towards women in the VGCC then it seems to  me that we can more forcefully draw their  attention to such episodes while we are  working within the organization rather  than by criticising them from without.  I stay in the VGCC because I believe in  building bridges.  Jane Rule has already said most of what I  would like to say about lesbians and gay  men working together in an article entitled "Sex War" which was first published  in Body Politic  and reprinted in The Out-  lander.  She closes the article saying, of  lesbians and gay men: "we may be an important source of genuine, if limited,  intersexual sympathy to bring this centuries old sex war to points of peaceful  negotiation".  The VGCC needs more women to plan and to  contribute to the monthly programs and the  Newsletter. Several lesbian and gay groups  already use the joint office space shared  by the VGCC, SEARCH and the MCC. As the  facilities continue to be improved more  congenial space will be available to other  groups for meetings, to drop in and for  serious and silly events.  Many changes have taken place during the  year since Marg left us. Many more are  under way. I hope you will come by and see  for yourself.  Margaret E. Edgar  VGCC has changed  during the past year  I wish to respond to Marg Verrall's comments in your July/August issue.  I am a lesbian who attended the founding  meetings of the Vancouver Gay Community  Centre, was an active board member for  two years, and can recall that for the  smattering of gay men and lesbians with  their dream and no past organizational  skills, Robert's Rules seemed a reasonable  alternative to total chaos. Despite Robert  and his Rules chaos did ensue for a time.  Yet from this muddle I must state that  the majority of direction and drive came  from the women, as it does today.  I do not deny the necessity for dialogue  relating to violence, incest and rape but  I do question the timing of delivery. Such  issues might be more readily explored in  the context of inter-organizational talks  and scheduled dialogues.  As for consciousness-raising groups in the  male community-I have seen and heard rather  heartening conversations between men of  all ages and affiliations when they meet  at 1244 Seymour Street. In the past our  locations were less conducive to such  dialogue, but I assure you it is going on  now. The focus of energy has shifted to a  more meaningful dialogue and understanding.  The space now available at the Community  Centre offices is evidence of the work of  one woman and one man-working together.  Once can imagine the accomplishments to  be achieved should this same determination  and compatibility become evident in larger numbers.  I can recall Margaret looking forward to  her involvement in the Community Centre.  At the time she felt that lesbians and  gay men needed a place to go, to meet, a  place of political action. She might even  recall the discussions about burn-out and  of how things can get tough when people  work as volunteers in the gay and women's  movements; of how political differences  arise and we can destroy one another instead of supporting each other.  We were open to everything. We needed the  diversity, and we needed to stay together.  I'm disappointed to find that Marg no  longer feels that way.  It is my belief that women liberate themselves but that men require women for  their own liberation. To that end I will  continue to work in conjunction with gay  men toward greater understanding and tolerant co-existence in our future.  Margaret, I hope to see you there.  L.
