Array Fort Simpson, B.C.  June 9th 1880    My dear Mother,   I was very sorry, and Thomas no less so, to hear that you were no better.  I had hoped that we should hear that you had improved.  You find it trying, I am sure, day and night to be in suffering, but, dear Mother, our God in whom you have trusted so many years will not forsake you now.  O I do hope and pray that you may be sustained and comforted day by day with His abounding grace.  I know you have the most loving care from our dear father and my sisters.  Know I wish I could share with them in their service of love - but I must not speak of that.  My little Jessie talks so much about you.  She is very sorry to know of your not being well, and often tells me how she would take care of you if she were with you.  Last Christmas I was struck with this - when I told her how you had not been able to go to Lefroy for Christmas she at once decided that when she is in Canada for Christmas, as she hopes to be some time, she would stay with you and let all the others go off for pleasure.  She is a most affectionate little girl, and delights in making others happy.  I missed her so much when she was in Victoria with her father.  They were gone four weeks but she was so well and so happy all the time she was away that the recital of this rewarded me amply.  Little Grace is growing fast and is full of fun.  Our baby is strong and well - the largest of the little flock at her age.  She is very good usually.  You would hardly believe, dear Mother, how rapidly I recovered after baby's coming.  I have always done well, at these times, you know, but never so well before as this past time.  I feel deeply grateful to God for His care over me.  I am sure no woman is more happily situated in her home than I am.   Dear Mother, we commend you to our gracious Father above.  I hope the next mail may bring tidings of your being better.  Thomas joins me in tenderest love.   Yours affectionately,    Emma
