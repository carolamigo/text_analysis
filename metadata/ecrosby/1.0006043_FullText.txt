Array Hamilton  March 13th 1874    My dear Mother,   I was so glad to get your letter this morning.  Many thanks for all the trouble you are taking and to my father for the money - it was more than I expected or shall need before I get home.  Dear Mamma, I do wish quite as much as you that I was with you.  But, besides the dress making I have to have some dentistry finished next week which will keep me over Tuesday and if I wait till Saturday Miss SÌ©gnier & Miss Stinson will come to Toronto with me - so I think I will fix that as the day of my leaving.  Mr. C may come up with me.  I am not sure - if not then very soon after.  I dare say it is not worth while for George McKay to meet me in T.  I think I will stop at Lefroy on my way up, if you can be there.  I want to see you and my father as soon as ever I can.  We can talk things over then at length - it will be a good deal of expense to take much with us - but for all but large heavy things less than the difference of the price, here & there.  It is very kind of Papa to place so much at my disposal as he has - it will be ample for all I want.  I do not like to think of taking your things Mamma for fear you should want them again.  I think this is all I need say about these things now - I don't feel like writing business today.     Dear Mamma, I do hope you and my father are feeling quite reconciled and happy about my future.  I am so sure it will all be right, and can trust for all I shall need.  You can trust for me too - can you not, Mother dear?  I wish you would write to Georgie about it.  This morning I had a letter from him.  He feels very bitterly about it and speaks of my grieving you & my father.  Surely you do not feel that my going is wrong - only that I think would really grieve you.   Love to Auntie & Sally.  With dearest affection for yourself and my dear father,    dear Mother, I am,    Yours as ever,     Emma    Miss Robertson sends love.
