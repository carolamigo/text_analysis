Array 1200 Barclay St. Vancouver July 17/20 <br> Dear Grace <br> Your letter of Wednesday came yesterday, and I found it very good reading I assure you.  I am very thankful you have found so satisfactory a place to stay and trust it may do for you all that we have hoped.  And then how glad we shall be to be home together again.  I hope you and Miss Metcalf will take that trip round the lake.  It will be a nice break for you both and it would be a pity not to see all you can of a country that is so beautiful.  I am keeping well and all is very quiet here.  Marian of course has taken pretty much all of Jessie's time & attention so far - she suffered a good deal after the operation but is going about now almost as usual - very much better.  This afternoon we all went for a drive round the Park & up to Shaunessy.  Marian enjoyed [it] as much as the rest of us.  She was pleased to get your card yesterday.  I have not been back to Kitsilano yet but I think I will go out there Monday if nothing prevents.  I want to see the family and also get any mail there may be.  Florence Bollert was to leave today for the East so I am sure Helen would want to be with her all she could during the last few days.  Your envelopes were put on the collection plate all right.  Harold went with me that morning & as I had more than I could conveniently carry I gave them to him. About Miss Metcalf coming back here we need not think of that yet anyway.  It would not be so pleasant for you without her I think.  It would be all right to give her the money you suggest if she needs it.  We have been having unusually hot weather - probably have felt it quite as much as you have in Kelowna.  However having nothing at all to do I have no cause to complain, and a good airy room to sleep in.  And Annie is expected sometime next week.  Jim we hear expects to be home in August.  With much love as ever, dearie, Mother.
