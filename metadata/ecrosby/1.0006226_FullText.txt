Array Fort Simpson, B.C.  June 9th 1880    My dear Father,   Your letter of May 12th came to hand this afternoon.  We were pained that there were not more cheering tidings of my mother's health.  It is painful to me to hear of her suffering but the "Lord doeth all things well."   Thank you dear father for writing us so fully.  Mr. Crosby read your letters with no less interest than I.  That you are so well and so happy in your own mind gives me real gladness.  The Lord is good.  He blesses us much. About the N.Y. Chr. Advocate - Mr. Crosby had subscribed for it before we heard of your doing so, and paid for it - for this year.  However, but one copy is sent so, I suppose, this could be put right.  We received the book given as premium.  We are much obliged to you for thinking of us in this way - the Advocate is well worth reading.   We are all well - our new baby a new joy to us.  Jessie has taken great delight in working the little book mark enclosed, and asks you to accept it with her love.  It is her own work.  I merely marked the letters and gave her some directions.  My husband joins me in kindest love to you.  Love to Susie and family.  I may not have time to write her by this mail.   Your affectionate daughter    Emma Bookmark "For Grandpapa
