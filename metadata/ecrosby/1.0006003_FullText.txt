Array Hamilton Feb. 9th, 1874<br>    My dear Mother,   It seems so long since I wrote to you that I will not let tonight pass without a letter to you however short it may be.  It is late and I am very tired, so it will not likely amount to much.  I got your letter in due time, and heard from Susie that you and Auntie were going down to Lefroy.  Susie must have had a hard time with only a little girl.  I have heard from Annie and Eliza too lately.  Eliza was to be in Cobourg tonight for the Miss. meeting & to stay a few days.  Annie was not very well when she wrote.  It seems too bad that Eliza's best friends should be leaving Castleton - they will miss them so much.  Our Miss. meetings were two weeks ago - both the returned missionaries were here & the meetings were really very interesting & quite enthusiastic.  You have not heard either of them have you?  They were in the college one afternoon & addressed the school.  I spent an evening at Mr. Sandford's lately very pleasantly - the last few weeks have been so busy I have not known what to do  We have a good deal of sewing on hand in a Dorcas Society we have in the college and that does not leave some of us much time - my incentive has been more useful within the last few weeks than ever before.  We have good sleighing now - I have had several good drives but not since the last snow came.  I am glad to hear of your cloak - I should think it would be quite pretty.  A new term begins this week and quite a number of new students are coming in so the school promises to be very full.  I wish I could write more but must not.  Let me know when you go to Susie's.  Do write soon.  Love to Auntie & Sallie & with much for yourself & my father.     Believe me, dear Mother,    Yours affectionately<br>     Emma
