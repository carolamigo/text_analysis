Array Fort Simpson, B.C.  Oct. 9th 1875    My dear Mother,   I have only time to write a few lines but Thomas says never to let an opportunity pass without writing.  It is near twelve Saturday night - & the mail goes early Monday.  Jessie has been in bed a long, long time.  She is still well and good and happy as a lark - God keep her so.   The work is near stopped on the church but Thomas wants to go to work on the house now.  The carpenter goes away by this str. - so does the teacher so the school will be left for somebody.  We have most of our winter supplies in.  We received by this str. from friends a box of preserves, a box of pears & apples & a brl. of apples.  The last time a lot of plums came, I have over thirty jars put away - besides some rhubarb & a little raspberry that was sent before.  We have apples also and a great quantity of cranberries.  I have chocolate on hand to take when I need it & also isinglass.  I do very well - we are getting vegetables now from the Fort.  I suppose by this time you are quite settled in Toronto.  I do hope you are comfortable.  Now do take things & make them just as easy as you can.  I hope you have a good girl.  We expect another str. this fall when I will try to write more fully.   Our love to you both.    Yours affectionately     Emma
