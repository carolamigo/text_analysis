Array Fort Simpson  July 6th 1880    My dear Mother,   I will write you just a few lines to tell you how we think of and pray for you without ceasing.  We are sorry to hear that you are no better, but in this we rest, that the Lord will not forsake you, and while He is present all must be well.  O how I should delight to be of some service to you now that you really need help.  Dear Mother, be assured you have our tenderest sympathy. I hope we shall have another letter from my father soon.   I have written a long letter to Susie about what we have been doing - when you feel disposed, perhaps she will read it to you.  My precious baby is such a comfort.  She is so good, night and day, it is a real pleasure to take care of you [her].  Kisses from Jessie and Grace and be assured that my husband unites with me in sincerest love to both my father and yourself, dear Mother,   Yours as ever,    Emma
