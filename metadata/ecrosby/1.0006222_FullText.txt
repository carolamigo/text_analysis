Array Fort Simpson, B.C.  July 29th 1880    My dear Mother,   I must write a few lines to you.  I do not like to let any chance pass without some word to you.  I have been hoping to hear of your being better - this mail brings me no news from home - but we shall likely soon have another.  Thomas has just returned from a visit to Bella Bella, about two hundred and thirty miles away, where a native agent has been working a few months.  The prospects of establishing a good Mission there are most encouraging but we hope that a minister may soon be stationed there, for the place is too far away to be connected with this mission.   My little baby is a real treasure - so bright and so good - and it is such a comfort to me to have her.  She sleeps always so well all night and a great deal during the day.  Jessie and Grace have been coughing lately - the weather has been very changeable - but I hope they will soon be better.  I have been very well indeed since baby came.  We have had a good many visitors this summer. Mr. & Mrs. Green & baby are here now - also Mr. & Mrs. Tate and a man from one of the fisheries - but most of them leave by the steamer tomorrow.   I suppose my father has been away attending the Conferences.  I hope we shall soon hear from him again.   Now, dear Mother, you may know that you have a tender place in my thoughts.  May the Lord abundantly bless you with all grace.  Our united love to yourself and my father.   Your affectionate daughter    Emma
