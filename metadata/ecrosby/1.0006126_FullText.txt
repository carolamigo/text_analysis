Array Fort Simpson  May 16th 1878    My dear Mother,   I have only a few minutes in which to write but I do not want the mail that we are about closing   to go without a letter to you.  The str. returned sooner than usual this time - that is why there was no   letter from you I suppose, but Thomas always thinks I must write you by every str. anyway.   We have been all pretty well - though the children have slight colds from changeable weather I   think.  Jessie has just been dosing her doll with sand in a toy spoon - she says her baby is sick.    Gracie is out in the garden with one of the girls.  They are full of play.     I suppose you will be preparing for the Conference by the time this reaches you.  You will enjoy   it I am sure but I hope you will arrange to have no extra work to do on account of it.  Miss Knott   intends to go to Victoria for a visit by the next trip of the str.  Thomas will stay home, I think till   her visit is over, then he contemplates some long journeys.   I have been pretty busy lately sewing - getting ready for summer.  I have been well almost   without exception, though I cannot stand much fatigue.  Papa said in his letter to Thomas that he had   attended to the renewal of the Globe subscription, but we have received none by the last two mails -    that is, the last date would be some time in January.  They came regularly before.  I do not know what   can be wrong.  I will try to write more by next mail.   Our best love to both yourself and my father,     Dear Mother, I am,      Your loving daughter.
