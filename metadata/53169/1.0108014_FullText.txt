 Creative Education; Disruptive Innovation UNIVERSITIES ROLE IN ENHANCING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY   A Vancouver Institute Lecture by Dr. Arvind Gupta, President and Vice-Chancellor University of British Columbia     Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 2 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  I would like to speak tonight about Canada’s performance in a unique international competition; it is the race to be productive. Productivity is not a code-word for working harder. It does not imply industries getting their employees to work longer hours. Productivity is a measure of the value produced for every hour of work. And rising productivity is the key to a rising standard of living. Traditionally, Canada has done reasonably well at raising productivity. We started with a country blessed with abundant natural resources, already a route to creating wealth. But we distinguished ourselves on the productivity front because we focused on having a highly educated populace and, by international Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 3 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  standards, one that is highly innovative. In a 2013 study called The Future of Productivityi, the accounting and management firm Deloitte reported that Canada once ran just behind the United States. In the mid-1980s, our productivity rate was 91% of theirs. But since then we’ve been slipping so that today is it only 78%. While Canadian workers contribute roughly $48 US per-hour-worked toward GDP, Americans produce almost $61 per hour. And the Norwegians churn out value at the rate of $77 per hour. We are not keeping up. Where exactly are we not keeping up? It’s not, as people once thought, that we aren’t working as hard. It’s much more about our ability to innovate. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 4 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Innovations, embedded into the goods and services we produce, spread across our land and around the globe, benefitting not just us but all humankind. It’s a classic win/win: when we do better at the productivity race, everyone benefits. Consider two examples: • In 1921, when Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered how to use insulin to treat diabetes, their innovation changed the future for people all over the world. • During the last 20 years, as Julio Montaner and his team at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS discovered and refined the use of antiretroviral therapy, they helped reduce the AIDS mortality Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 5 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  rate by 90%. Their formulation made these therapies more productive – and we all won. Alas, when we lose at the productivity race, we lose alone. Sure, Canadians still get to use the iPhones and MRI machines that other countries invent, but - if - we - don’t innovate ourselves, our standard of living slides comparatively. Even our natural resources will not save us, if innovators in other countries find a way to bring their resources to market faster and more efficiently, or if they add more value to their resources than we do. So, in our own individual interests, in the national interest and for the sake of all humankind, the productivity race is a competition that we must win. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 6 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The question, of course, is how? There are lots of answers, and lots of experts to expound on the variations. There are corporate strategies and tax measures. Deloitte argues, convincingly, that Canada should spend much more on research, noting that our current investment level puts us in the bottom quartile among our competitors in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – the OECD. For my part, this evening, I want to focus on the human element. I want to look specifically at the capacity and the responsibility that the post-secondary community has: • First, to support innovation immediately and directly; and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 7 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  • Second, to ensure that our students turn into the innovators who will continue to enhance every part of society – in health, in social policy, in environmental sustainability and in advancing economic prosperity. Let’s start by agreeing on the definition of innovation. To innovate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is to “bring in new methods (or) ideas.” The Canadian Academies described innovation with the following schematic. Let me simplify this. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 8 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Here, innovation is creative people, married to smart money, producing solutions to socio-economic challenges. Phrased as a sentence, that seems like a linear process: we nurture creativity; then we link to community; and, together, we reap the benefit. But, in keeping with this image, I suggest that the process is considerably more interactive. Canada’s best post-secondary institutions certainly have an advanced capacity to cultivate creativity – in students, among researchers and in the larger community. But the richest returns may come in the interplay among students, faculty, industry and civil society. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 9 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Specifically, I’d like to argue that creativity flows from a wealth of experiences, some of them from formal education, but many of them opportunistic. That being the case, in order to nurture and leverage creativity, we must maximize the opportunity for students and faculty to enjoy a diversity of experience, in and out of the classroom, in and out of the lab, within and amongst different disciplines – and in constant connection to community. We then complete a perfect loop: by working in the context of real-world problems our students and researchers enjoy a wide range of new experiences. They connect directly to the very socio-economic challenges we want to address. Our complicated Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 10 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  society and the burgeoning economy then become the very source of our creative energy. * So what is “creativity? Going back to the dictionary, the Oxford defines “creative” as “inventive and imaginative.” This seems clear and simple enough. But there is a trap in the language. Whenever we are invited to think about “the creative arts,” the subject seems limited to the high arts and literature. This covers a narrow section of the academy and seems to exclude science altogether – as if the Internet was invented by people who are NOT creative. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 11 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The evidence actually suggests that the richest creative veins are to be found not in one branch of the academy or the other, but in the connections among them all. Innovation most often arises when we combine the rigors of discipline with the delights, distractions and provocations of art and entertainment. And when I say “entertainment,” I don’t just mean music and movies or even poetry and provocative fiction. The definition can apply to any experience that its subject enjoys.  This makes intuitive sense: In order to innovate – say, as an economist, a computer scientist, a physician or an architect – we must first master the fundamentals of the specialty. We must be rigorous and disciplined. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 12 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  But the inspiration for true creativity is unlikely to be found in the textbook; that’s what people mean when they suggest we “think outside the box.” There is also anecdotal evidence for this view. For example, UBC’s own Nobel Laureate Michael Smith once told the former UBC President Martha Piper that he got many of his best ideas not in the laboratory but in the Orpheum Theatre – he found inspiration in the ethereal strains of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. In an interview in 1929, Albert Einstein made a similar suggestion. He said, “If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I live my daydreams in music. I Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 13 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  see my life in terms of music. I get most of my joy in life out of music.”1 Einstein told his friend, the Japanese violinist Shinichi Suzuki, “The theory of relativity occurred to me by intuition, and music is the driving force behind this intuition. My parents had me study the violin from the time I was 6. My new discovery is the result of musical perception.”2 There is a suggestion here of some kind of biological interdisciplinarity – of an advanced capacity that emerges when different parts of the brain work together.                                                  1 Albert Einstein, quoted in Alice Calaprice, and Trevor Lipscombe, Albert Einstein: A Biography (Greenwood Press, 2005), 5. 2 Robert & Michele Root-Bernstein, "The Art & Craft of Science," Educational Leadership (February 2013), 16; Shinichi Suzuki, Nurtured by Love (1969), 90. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 14 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The benefit of art to the scientist is well-researched. For example, Robert and Michele Root-Bernstein at Michigan State University put together a team of researchers to test the theory. Looking at Nobel Prize winners, the team pored over obituary notices, memoirs and biographies – searching for evidence that Nobel inspiration may have flowed from an avocation in the “arts or crafts.” The team set a high bar for their test. It wasn’t enough that a laureate had an impressive collection of art or music. The shortlist included only those laureates who “described themselves or were described by biographers as being a painter, photographer, actor, performer, composer, poet, dancer, craftsman, Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 15 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  glassblower, etc. ... or if there was direct evidence of artwork, photographs, sculptures, compositions, poems, (or) performances ….” The findings were remarkable: 94 per cent of Nobel laureates were actively involved in an arts or crafts avocation.  Nobel prize winners in general were: • twice as likely to be a musician, composer, or conductor as the average scientist; • three times as likely to have arts and crafts hobbies; • seven times more likely to be a painter, sculptor, woodworker, glassblower; Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 16 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  • 12 times more likely to write poetry, plays or novels; and • 22 times more likely to be a dancer, actor, magician or other performer.3 Frederick Banting, for example, was a painter, who regularly chummed around with A.Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris.4 Here’s Banting landscape – it’s actually called “Northern Landscape” – very much in the Group of Seven style. The counter influence – of science over art – is less well-documented, but the case seems equally compelling. Books and movies are filled with examples of science in art. And many artists have found                                                  3 Root-Bernstein, et al., 54. 4 Bliss, Michael. "Banting: A Biography," Toronto: University of Toronto Press Incorporated, 1992. Page 51. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 17 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  inspiration in science. For example, the author Arthur Miller has marshalled convincing evidence that, while Einstein was humming his way through the theory of relativity, Pablo Picasso was reading and thinking about Einstein’s scientific preoccupation – time and simultaneity – while he was working on his revolutionary cubist painting, Les Demoiselle  d’Avignon.5 The point is that neither discipline is more creative than the other. Rather, whatever your specialty, a diversity of pursuits – a rich variety of inputs – is more likely to engender a creative output. From Leonardo da Vinci to Chris Hadfield, the polymaths have                                                  5 Miller, Arthur, “Einstein, Picass: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Chaos, Basic Books, 2001. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 18 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  demonstrated, again and again, the benefits of a broad, interdisciplinary and ongoing education. * So much for the alchemy of creativity; what of the strategy to nurture innovative research? How do we leverage what we know about creativity to cultivate research excellence? Well, if we accept that creativity flows from a wealth of experience, then we must ensure that researchers are immersed in diverse and stimulating environments. This notion runs contrary to a traditional view of what constitutes the richest environment for academic thought. There was, for centuries, a contention that Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 19 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  academics did their best work when left alone and that universities functioned best as ivory towers or, at the very least, as cloisters safely removed from the bustle and distraction of the wider world.  In this model, Einstein was the quintessential philosopher scientist: patent clerk by day; transformative physicist by night. We’re led to believe that when he was developing the Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein had no master other than curiosity.  Einstein himself once said, and I quote: “There are certain occupations, even in modern society, which entail living in isolation and do not require great physical or intellectual effort. Such Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 20 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  occupations as the service of lighthouses and lightships come to mind. Would it not be possible to place young people who wish to think about scientific problems, especially of a mathematical or philosophical nature, in such occupations? Very few young people with such ambitions have, even during the most productive period of their lives, the opportunity to devote themselves undisturbed for any length of time to problems of a scientific nature.” 6  Sir Isaac Newton conducted his best research in a similarly “pure” environment. The archetypal cloistered academic, Newton came to a revolutionary                                                  6 Einstein, Albert, and Alice Calaprice. The Ultimate Quotable Einstein. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 2011., pp 102-03 Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 21 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  understanding of gravity without venturing much past the apple orchard outside Trinity College Cambridge. In an essay entitled, “The Diatribe of Doctor Akakia,” Voltaire praised Newton as “a remarkably stationary man, the embodiment of spiritual and scholarly solitude.”7 By contrast, Voltaire dismissed, Pierre Louis Maupertuis, then-president of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin, for wandering the world, pendulums in hand, measuring the shape of the earth to test Newton’s theory of gravity. Voltaire sniffed, and I quote “You have confirmed in the most boring places                                                  7 Schaffer, 244. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 22 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  what Newton knew without ever leaving home.” End quote. This notion of scholarly reclusiveness, however, collapses under scrutiny. Einstein wasn’t living in a lighthouse, idly contemplating Newtonian concepts of space and time. He was spending his days in the patent office in Bern, Switzerland, applying himself to the industrial preoccupations of the day.  At the turn of the 20th century, one of the chief such issues was the problem of how to make distant clocks tell the same time. Walking daily past streets clocks such as this one, Einstein would have known that, from August 1, 1890, they had all ticked in relative synchrony, thanks to a new network of electromagnets Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 23 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  and telegraph cables. As Peter Galison writes in the book, Einstein’s Clocks, “all around him, literally, was the burgeoning fascination with electrocoordinated time.”8 This was serious business – a matter of life and death. In an increasingly crowded railway world, what may begin as a theoretical question about the simultaneity of distant events can resolve, suddenly, as a crash at a railway crossing. So, Einstein the patent clerk was not daydreaming about pure physics; he was trying to make sense of hundreds of applications related to electric timekeeping.9 He was wrestling with the partial                                                  8 Galison, "Einstein's Clocks," 375. 9 Galison, "Einstein's Clocks," 368. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 24 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  differential equations that Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell had produced in a 1865 paper, “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.” Maxwell’s equations implied different values for the electromagnetic currents produced when a magnet interacted with a coil – one value for when the coil was in motion, another for when the magnet was in motion with respect to the ether. But Einstein knew that, experimentally, the same values were produced regardless of whether the magnet was moving or still.10                                                  10 Peter Galison, “Einstein’s Clocks: The Place of Time,” Critical Enquiry 26, no. 2 (2000), 357 Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 25 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  While other physicists tried to resolve this contradiction by experimenting with the way time was altered in different reference frames, Einstein redefined the nature of time altogether.11  The important point, for this discussion, is that his innovation was informed by and applied to his day-to-day work. According to Galison, Einstein’s 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” even looked like a patent application. * What then of Newton the homebody?                                                  11 Ibid., 374. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 26 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  In his paper, “Newton on the Beach: The Information Order of Principia Mathematica,” the historian Simon Schaffer confirms that Newton barely budged from Trinity College Cambridge after his appointment there, at age 18, in 1661. But the record also shows that Newton was one of the best-connected hermits on the planet. The calculations that he used to develop his laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation depended upon observations and records that were made all over the world.12 From mariners and missionaries, Newton had information on tides in the East Indies, the Straits of                                                  12 Schaffer, 244-245. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 27 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Magellan, Chile, Peru, the Gulf of Tonkin, Bristol and Plymouth.13 Observations of comets came from Europe, New England, South America, and Asia. Observations on the lengths of pendulums (essential for the determining the shape of the earth and the force of gravity) came from Europe, South America and from slaving ports on the west coast of Africa. This is a map of trade routes of the day, and the stars indicate the source points I just mentioned. All of these observations travelled back to Newton through the Republic of Letters – a sort of 17th century internet – and from the Global Imperial Trade Networks.                                                  13 Schaffer 253-256. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 28 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Neither was Newton at arm’s length from these networks. He had one of the largest investments in the East India Company (around 10,000 pounds, or about $1.5 million in today’s dollars) and he lost twice that amount in the notorious South Sea Company. His interests in time and distance were more than theoretical.  So, Einstein lived in the world and dreamed about solitude. Newton lived in solitude but dreamed of the world. Both men applied themselves to some of the most fundamental questions of science. And both had direct interest in the applications of their own research.  Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 29 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  * Yet there were still those, before Einstein’s time and since, who argued for a separation between the academy and the community – even between the great researchers of this generation and the up-and-coming talent of the next. For example, Henry Augustus Rowland, the first President of the American Physical Society, rose at the 1883 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science to condemn the new trend to better connect institutional researchers to societal partners. Rowland said, “A ‘true’ university need(s) well-paid professorships and well-appointed laboratories, ... ‘pure’ by virtue of being a refuge for Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 30 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  research and a preserve from the pressures of the outside world.”14 If we were to accept this view unreservedly, what could UBC – or any of the world’s great research universities – promise to an ambitious student? As it is, we offer an opportunity to interact with some of the foremost researchers in the world. UBC’s research excellence gives our students immediate access to the latest discoveries and revelations. There is assuredly a place for research chairs and professorships, and I would never deny our students the inspiration, enthusiasm and cutting-edge                                                  1414 Lucier, Paul, "The Origins of Pure and Applied Science in Gilded Age America," Isis 103, no. 3 (2012): 530-531. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 31 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  knowledge that you can only get from professors who are innovating at the very top of their field. As for being “a preserve from the pressures of the outside world,” that is antithetical to what I believe UBC or any top flight international research institution should be. We see in all the foregoing examples that research is more powerful when it has relevance and that researchers are more creative not when they take refuge from the world, but when they live in it. Great researchers are inspired by their students, by their surroundings, by the music they hear or play, by the issues that challenge their society. If we are to be innovative, if we are to leverage our research capacity to increase the productivity of our community and our Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 32 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  country, we will do so by embracing the pressures of the outside world. So, if we are to cultivate research excellence and maximize our own capacity for innovation, we must do three things - - -  1.We must support the research enterprise at every level; 2.We must integrate it wherever possible with other elements of the academy; and 3.We must promote engagement – among our faculty, between faculty and students and, critically, between the academy and the community. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 33 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The modern research university is not a refuge; it is a hub – a nexus. It’s a place where people go to learn, to think, to be entertained and provoked. It’s a place where industry and civil society can go for help in answering the pressing questions of the day. If Einstein were around today, he would be no more likely than he was in 1905 to choose work in an isolated lighthouse. He would find somewhere like UBC and he would have the time of his life. * So, there will be no simple first-year course in originality or imagination. Creativity is complicated and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 34 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  it arises from the interconnections of every part of the academy.  And there is no secret lab to which we may all remove ourselves – to think and to innovate. Our best discoveries – our most transformative revelations – will come in the complex interplay among disciplines and among those who think and those who do. How do we most effectively deliver that innovative energy beyond the academy? And how do we tap into the needs, the demands and the creative energy of the wider community to inform and inspire our own work? Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 35 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  A first step is to acknowledge that, as a nation, this is something that we don’t do well enough now. The Deloitte report I mentioned earlier notes:  “Canada’s science and engineering academics perform admirably in international publication rankings, but our performance in the global intellectual property statistics suggests that many of our great ideas are failing to make their way out of the lab.” As an aside, I am happy to say that, at UBC at least, that’s not the case. Among Canadian universities, the C.D. Howe Institute reported in 2013 that UBC ranks first in total patents, U.S. patents and income from licensed intellectual property. And from 1991 to 2010, we ranked second in licenses, inventions and start-ups. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 36 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  We claimed 139 patents and launched 18 spin-off companies in the past three years alone. Our research impact is estimated at $6 billion annually. But Canada exhibits an unacceptable gap between university research and industrial innovation. The Royal Society of Canada put out a position paper just this month entitled, “Driving Growth Through Research: The importance of research for Canada’s future in the world knowledge economy.” In it, the Society notes that Canadian business investment in research and development is among the lowest of the industrialized economies.15                                                  15 Royal Society of Canada, Driving Growth Through Research: The importance of research for Canada’s future in the world knowledge economy, Retrieved October 9, 2014 from: http://www.rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/PP_Driving%20Growth_EN.pdf Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 37 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The Science, Technology and Innovation Council, on which I sit, said something similar in a State of the Nation report in 2010: “Economists are increasingly focusing on a lack of innovation in Canada as a contributor to poor productivity performance.”16 One of the problems appears to be that Canada lacks an innovation culture. It all starts with talent. Whether in civil society and industry – in the social sciences and humanities and in the hard sciences and engineering – innovation comes most frequently from the most highly qualified people. And yet the Conference Board of Canada reports that, among our OECD competitors, only Japan graduates                                                  16 Science, Technology and Innovation Council, Imagination to Innovation: Building Canadian Paths to Prosperity, Retrieved Oct. 10, 2014 from: http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/vwapj/10-059_IC_SotN_Rapport_EN_WEB_INTERACTIVE.pdf/$FILE/10-059_IC_SotN_Rapport_EN_WEB_INTERACTIVE.pdf Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 38 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  fewer PhD students per capita than Canada.17 We educate half as many as the U.K. or Germany and perhaps one-third of Switzerland. Then, compared to the U.S., Canadian companies hire fewer PhD graduates and pay them less – which the Conference Board suggests as an explanation for why more Canadians don’t commit to doctoral programs. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: fewer PhDs; fewer companies hiring PhDs; less industrial innovation; fewer opportunities for students. Students need to know there will be a return for the time and money that they invest in furthering their                                                  17 Conference Board of Canada, How Canada Performs.

And businesses and civil society institutions need to understand the potential advantage of engaging – and engaging with – highly qualified people. In the current situation, it appears that lack of familiarity is breeding disinterest – to everyone’s disadvantage.  We’re especially conscious of this at UBC. British Columbia runs behind the national average in the number of PhDs we produce per capita. We need to do more – and we will need close community partnerships in order to improve our performance. In looking at solutions to this conundrum, I could start by pointing out areas where students and the prospective employers are already well connected. In Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 40 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Education, for example, we would never send a new teacher into the classroom without first giving them a structured opportunity to test their knowledge and skills. Neither would we send a nurse, a doctor or a physiotherapist into the work world without hands-on experience. Integration in the fields of health and medicine is something that UBC does extensively: we have deep affiliations with eleven (11) teaching hospitals and the BC Cancer Agency. But it’s also a field in which we are determined to do better. We started a few years ago with a distributed medical program that now educates and trains physicians in Vancouver, Kelowna, Victoria and Prince Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 41 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  George. This extends some of UBC’s greatest capacities not just into the community but to the far reaches of the province. We are also asserting our leadership in medical research. Consider, for example, the The Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, which opened this year under founding director Dr. Max Cynader. This facility unites under one roof UBC’s research and clinical expertise in neuroscience, psychiatry and neurology. Here you see world-leading treatment, teaching and research. You see some of the best practitioners in the country – and the world – inspiring and being inspired by a generation of students who get a chance to apply a theoretical understanding to an Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 42 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  unfolding reality. Those students also bring a degree of originality, ingenuity and imagination that inspires, challenges and energizes their mentors. And everyone is driven by real-world challenges that, up close, demand a solution. This model – of experiential learning and two-way communication between the academy and the working world – has also found a foothold in other disciplines. Our Engineering co-op program, for example, is the largest in western Canada and one of its greatest outputs is success stories. First, from a student perspective, 90% of those who participate in a co-op placement wind up with a permanent job with their co-op employer. Students Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 43 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  are clearly getting the experience they need – and they are proving it to prospective employers along the way. They also become the engine for innovation. Consider Radu Postole, a self-described “mediocre student” until his first co-op term with a German research firm called GKSS. Thanks to this experience, Postole said, “It suddenly dawned on me how all the academic learning is applicable in the real world.” Postole spent the rest of his study time on the Dean’s honour role. After working with UBC’s own Structured Surface Physics Lab on an alternative energy project called Solar Canopy, he leveraged his well-refined technical skills to get his first “real” job with a start-up Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 44 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  company called SunCentral, helping advance the UBC solar lighting technology into a marketed product. Another multidisciplinary model for community integration is called Mitacs, a national, non-profit organization that manages and funds research and training programs for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. I was the CEO and Scientific Director for the past 15 years. Mitacs is fundamentally an engagement mechanism, working with 60 universities, thousands of employers in the private and public sectors, and with every provincial jurisdiction in the country.  For example, the Mitacs Accelerate program facilitates research internships for graduate students and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 45 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  postdoctoral fellows with industries across all disciplines. One such student was Reynald Hoskinson, a Mitacs intern who helped the Vancouver-based Recon Industries develop its Heads-up Display ski goggles. Based on the display characteristics of fighter-jet face-shields, Recon’s GPS-activated goggles feature an LCD screen that tells you your speed, positioning, distance travelled. And on the distance-travelled question, Hoskinson is now Recon’s Research and Development Manager. This is a typical result for Mitacs, which has arranged some 10,000 collaborative research projects, boosting R&D at Canadian companies, enabling established Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 46 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  researchers to apply their skills, and providing training and experience for our most highly-educated students. Mitacs – is – an – innovation – engine:  14% per cent of Mitacs interns started their own company – that’s twice the usual rate for graduate students. 1. Mitacs interns were placed into 2,500 jobs, 900 of which were brand new positions. This indicates that we are making a measurable difference in how many PhDs are finding employment in industry and how many companies are coming to understand the value of researchers with this level of competence. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 47 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  2. 97% of Mitacs’ industrial partners said the Accelerate experience made them even more interested in collaborating with academic researchers;  3. while 74% said they now intend to increase their investment in R&D. And thanks to their hands-on experience,  4. A decade out, Mitacs graduates are earning an average $10,000 a year more than their graduate-level colleagues. Given this experience, one of the first commitments I made when I took over as UBC President was to double the number of experiential learning opportunities on Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 48 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  and off campus through internships and co-op programs. This, however, is just one example of the kind of community engagement that must become even more commonplace. It’s just one example of the research and educational innovations that we plan for UBC in the years to come.  The pursuit of creativity, the support of interdisciplinarity and the goal of more effective and complete community integration will demand attention throughout the academy. Because there is no simplistic secret of success, no magic formula – except this: Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 49 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  1. Creativity flows from a wealth of experience and is best engendered with a broad, varied and lifelong education – of the heart as well as the head; 2. In order to nurture and leverage the creative energies of our students and faculty, we must maximize their opportunity to enjoy a diversity of experience, within the university and in constant and intimate connection to community. 3. Every individual – and any organization – that joins in a close collaboration between the academy and the community is likely to reap enormous rewards. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 50 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Here, we return to the question of productivity. It is important to remember that this is not, exclusively and narrowly, an economic measure. There is a great deal of good, in Canada and the world that cannot be expressed within the computations of Gross Domestic Product. Creativity, innovation and research excellence are certainly important to economic prosperity, but equally so to the quality of Canadian justice, to our personal health and social well-being and to our environmental health and sustainability. Canada begins with a huge advantage – this vast, beautiful, rich country. We have built one of the most admired societies on the planet, with an education system that stands amongst the best in the world.  Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 51 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Our universities are already engaged in the issues that matter most to all of us. But the more we can immerse ourselves directly in society – the more we can bring the community even closer to the academy – the greater will be our chances for real innovation, that will benefit us all. I invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Thank you.                                                  i Currie, B., Scott, L., Deloitte, The Future of Productivity: A Wake-up Call for Canadian Companies, Deloitte, 2013.
