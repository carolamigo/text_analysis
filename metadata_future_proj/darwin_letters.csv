1.0000084~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, June 24, 1873]~Charles Darwin, "Down", Beckenham, Kent to John Burdon-Sanderson. Asks Sanderson to read the results of his experiments on Drosera and to make any suggestions; explains the object of his research on these plans. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Letterhead:  Down, Beckenham, Kent.  June 24 1873  My dear Dr Sanderson  I am going to beg a great favour of you, viz. to read over the enclosed brief abstract of the results of certain experiments on Drosera; & then to answer 3 or 4 questions, & to consider whether you can suggest any other soluble substances which it wd be well worth my trying.   I do not wish to try many more, as I hardly know whether these results are worth much, & I do know that I have not sufficient knowledge.  Drosera is highly peculiar by possessing absorbent glands on the leaves, & by shewing thro' the inflection of the tentacles, the influence of certain fluids.  It will be well to explain how the enclosed results were obtained: I place half a minim of the solution on the glands at the disk of the leaf;  & when I speak of "inflection", I always mean that the circumferential tentacles have become inflected, tho' their glands have not absorbed any of the fluid: the circumferential tentacles are caused to move by the stimulus transmitted from the glands of the disk.  My object in the experiments here referred to, has been to ascertain how far those soluble substances which produce any strongly marked effect on animals, likewise affect Drosera: fluids which actually corrode the tissues seem to me unimportant. My queries are appended to the enclosed results & are marked with red lines, so as to catch your attention.  You will confer a great kindness on me, if you will advise me ever so briefly, or make any suggestions.  It will perhaps save you a little trouble to write any remarks on the back of my pages.  Pray forgive me for asking this favour, which I fear is somewhat unreasonable, & believe me  Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin  I was very glad to read your article in last Nature.-

Congratulates Sanderson on his article in "Nature"; has found another plant that catches flies and can digest. A.L.S.  2 p.~Array Down, Beckenham, Kent.  June 12 1874  My dear Dr Sanderson  I have just read your article in Nature.  It is very interesting, & in my opinion cd not be better done. I look forward to the next number, in which you will give your discovery, which the more I think of, seems, to me the more important.  I hear from Frank that your illustrations were capital.  I did not answer your last note, as I had then much to do. I hope after a week or so to receive an account of your digestive experiments.   I must add that I have found another plant (Pinguicola) which catches flies & can also digest - yours very sincerely Ch Darwin P. S. I read several years ago a paper in (I think) Report of Brit Assoc J  (I think?!) by Dr. C----  B---- or  Dr Fraser on the physiological action of various salts & acids, when injected with the blood of animals. I think isomeric or isomorphous substances acted in nearly the same manner.  I remember I thought the [?] extremely curious, but I never thought that it wd concern me to use it ? for amusement   I hear in [?] [? time] [?] many acids and salts on Drosera, I shd much like to read the paper again.

1.0000147~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, April 10, 1875]~J. Burdon-Sanderson has altered the order and arrangement slightly and asks for Darwin's approval of the changes. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array April 10, 1875    Dear Mr Darwin,  If the alterations as I have made them seem to you sufficient I think we may make them without consulting any of those who have already signed, for they involve no change even of words � only change of order & arrangement.  The changes are however sufficient I think to avoid risk of misconstruction.  I am afraid that I shall not be at home tomorrow after 10:30 but I will come and see you before that time or at one clock if it appears to you desirable.  If in passing you will leave a card for me with the hour on it I will understand.  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
1.0000154~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to William Darwin Fox, June 8, 1856]~Charles Darwin, Down, to W. Darwin Fox, Old Parsonage, High Harrowgate. He is sorry Fox is unwell; Darwin has been working very hard lately and at the moment is most interested in domestic rabbits and ducks. Because of the doubt about origins, he is more interested in pigeons and ducks than poultry. Sir C. Lyell has urged Darwin to write a Preliminary Essay and he has begun but is full of doubt about the work; asks if he may quote Fox about never having seen or heard of a blueish-grey cat that was not deaf.  A.L.S., 2 p. envelope.~Array Down Bromley Kent  8th    My dear Fox,  I write just to say the splendid Cock had arrived, & now I have got your letter, I am most sincerely sorry, my dear old friend, at all the great suffering you have undergone.  I have always understood that lumbago & sciatica cause extreme pain. - How much illness you have had in your life, & at different times how much misery!  It is lucky, when young, that one does not foresee the future.  I do hope that the waters are so (nasty?) that they will do you good. - We are all well here, except for my poor dear wife who is wretched (perhaps in family way) & has been wretched for weeks; & I fear that it will stop (?).  I have been working of late very hard & have now an enormous correspondence. - I think I shall make an interesting collection of domestic (?) for promises are coming in from all quarters.  This morning I heard from Rajah Brooke with promises of energetic assistance and Hon. Cl. (Nurny?) says Pigeons & Fowls are on (this?) road for me from Persia; as are others from (E. and W. superimposed?) Africa. - At the present moment I am most interested about domestic Rabbits; having just sent an angora to be (skeletonised?), & having compared a P. Santo, common, & (Hare?) Rabbit skeletons & found, I believe, most remarkable differences. - Ducks too are my delight: pray do not forget a Call Drake or Duck if you shd. have the misfortune (oh what hypocrisy!) to lose one.  Can you tell me anything about difference in habits in Rabbits?  Do you know any breed of Ducks besides tufted, hook-billed (both of which I have had from Holland); Penguin; Call; & Black Indian or B. (Agres?) Duck. -  Even (sub?)-(?) wl. be of value to me.  On account of doubt on origin I have come to care more about them & Pigeons than about Poultry; not that I shall give up poultry. - Mr. C. Lyell was staying here lately, & I told him somewhat of my views on species, & he was sufficiently struck to suggest, (& has since written (10?) strings to (urge?) me) to me to publish a (sort?) of Preliminary Essay.  This I have begun to do, but my work will be horribly imperfect & with many mistakes, so that I groan & tremble when I think of it.  By the way I want just to (put), as an illustration of singular (?) in organisation, that "I have been assured (by?) (?) Mr. W.D. Fry that he has never seen or heard of a blueish-grey cat which was not deaf." may I quote you? or must I put in "friend".  Do you still believe in the generality of fact?  Might I say that you have seen or heard of as many as 6?  But please mind, do not answer this note if it pains or troubles you. - I do most truly regret that you were not able to pay us a visit; I shd. have so much enjoyed it. -       My dear (old?) friend      Yours most (tly?)

1.0000101~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, October 9, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Wants to know if fibrin, areolar tissue, gelatin and other substances are allied in any way because they affect Drosera in a similar  way. [Reply follows] Burdon-Sanderson suggests that the similarities may be due to the water solubility of certain substances. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Down,   Beckenham, Kent  Oct.9.74  Mr dear Dr Sanderson,  I am going to beg your opinion & information on one point if you can give it.  I am finally working up my long chapter on digestion by Drosera.  I find that fibrin, areolar tissue, the fibrous basis of bone, & gelatin all agree in being easily dissolved by the secretion, but none of them excite the leaves much, incomparably less than meat, albumen etc.  Fibrocartilage behaves in the same way excepting that it is never thoroughly liquefied.  Now what I want to know is whether these substances viz. � fibrin, areolar tissue, the fibrous basis of bone, gelatine, & fibrocatilage are chemically or physiologically allied, their action on animals to which they are given as food; for instance, is it known whether a dog would perish as soon when fed on fibrin as on gelatine?  I should be gratified for any scrap of information on this lead.  You will see that I speak of the "fibrous basis of bone".  Is this a correct expression?  In almost every page of my MS I feel how much I owe to you.  Yours very sincerely   Ch Darwin  Reply � On carefully considering the fact notice viz. that the bodies fibrin, aerolar tissue, gelatin & the fibrous basis of bone differ for meat & albumin in test exciting on leaves of Drosera. that the diffc  may be dependent on the ? that the former one used in a prepared i.e. washed over the ? as a crude i.e. un-worked consequently heat in the latter heterogeneous stuff soluble in water (? water extractive) is present, as the former absent � and ? in as much as the first ? for chemical excelator is ?? excel? material should be soluble.  This may explain the difference � I think it probable that thoroughly worked meat would act less exciting than less worked.
1.0000138~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, May 23, 1875]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 49 Queen Anne Street [London] to Charles Darwin. He thinks Playfair compromised too much and is glad compromise is over; hope the inquiry will ensure the rights of scientific research and teaching.~Array 49, Queen Anne Street.  May 23    Dear Mr Darwin  I have no doubt that Mr. Playfair pressed upon by men whose avowed object is the suppression of science has gone too far in his direction of compromise. I am delighted therefore to think that compromise is at an end.  Its certainly a great shame that, for the sake of a popular clamour supported by no facts, it should be necessary to consent to an exact (com)ment which would make it penal to teach science in the only way that it can be taught effectively. Is it really too great a sacrifice to make. I hope that his full enquiry which will now take place will result in the securing of the interests both of scientific teaching & scientific research. May I suggest that it would be well to send to Playfair a copy of Huxley's letter on the subject. I have written as clearly as I can & have sent him his Litchfield letters.    Very truly yours  J.M. Sanderson
1.0000088~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, February 10, 1875]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Asks about the digestion of phosphates in animals; has written to Huxley suggesting that physiologists and biologists petition for a reasonable act on vivisection. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Down, Beckenham, Kent  Railway Station  Orpington S.E.R.    Feb.10.75    My dear Dr. Sanderson,    Do you by any chance know whether animals can digest or decompose phosphate of potassium so as thus to obtain phosphorus?  I ask because (the?) phosphates of soda, lime, & ammonia act most powerfully on Drosaea, whereas phosphate of potassium is as innocent as gum or sugar.  I wrote some little time ago to Huxley, suggesting that Physiologists & biologists should petition the H. of Commons to pass a reasonable act on vivisection, in the spirit of the Liverpool Brit. Assoc. resolutions.  He said he would consult you; & I hope that you think well of the suggestion, & that something of the kind, or something better, will be done.  I feel very anxious on the subject, for the sake of the grand Science of Physiology, & especially as an enactment advised by leading Physiologists would have much moral influence on students and others.      Pray believe me          Yours very sincerely      Charles Darwin

A.L.S., 1p. envelope~Array July 10th, 1878  My dear Fox,  I was indeed grieved to see yesterday in the Times the great loss which you have suffered.  I know well what misery this loss will cause to your affectionate disposition & to poor Mrs Fox.  Emma desires me to say how much she sympathises with you both.  It is no use whatever my writing, but I could not endure not to do so � I hope she did not suffer much.  Do not write to me unless doing something is a little relief to you.

A.L.S., 1 p.~Array Bassett Southampton   [Down, Beckenham, Kent � Railway Station Orpington S.E.S.]    May 13�79     My dear Sanderson,  I have been astonished by the announcement yesterday that the R. Coll of Physcns has awarded me the Baly medal & I am asked to attend to receive it after the Harveian Oration.  I mention this because I have thought that you could give me some idea how long this oration lasts, & at what hour it takes place; for I am not  a little afraid of the exertion. Am I expected to make any speech & if so would a few words suffice? Any information would be gratefully received.  Who was Baly was he the translator of Muller?  Pray forgive me for applying to you in my perplexity.  Yours very sincerely,  Charles Darwin
1.0000079~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, October 1, 1873]~Charles Darwin, "Down"  to John Burdon-Sanderson. Hopes that his observations about the movement of the motor influence from excited glands in Drosera leaves will help Burdon-Sanderson. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Down,  Beckenham, Kent    My dear Dr Sanderson,  I hear from Frank the Drosera has been behaving perversely.  I write a line, as it may possibly have a bearing on this perversity, viz that the motor influence is sent from the excited gland more quickly & completely in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction in the laminae of the leaf.    [diagram with labels: longitudinal, transverse direction, footstalk]    Yours very sincerely  Ch Darwin
1.0000103~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, July 25, 1873]~Charles Darwin, "Down"  to John Burdon-Sanderson. Discusses the latest results regarding the digestive powers of Drosera and Dionaea; the different substances that cause inflection; the effects of heat and of phosphate of ammonia on the leaves. A.L.S. 2 p. Printed in Darwin Frances. "The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin", V. 2, p. 495.~Array Down,  Beckenham, Kent    July 25 1873    My dear Dr. Sanderson,      I shd like to tell you a little about my recent work with Drosera, to show that I have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or two.    (1) It is really beautiful how quickly & well Drosera & Dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine.  I kept the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison.  When you were here I forgot that I had tried gelatine, but albumen is far better for watching its dissolution & absorption. Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for (pepsine?) & in the autumn he will discover what acid the digestive juice contains.    (2) A decoction of cabbage leaves & green peas causes as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat: a decoction of grass is less powerful.  Though I hear that the chemists try to precipitate all albumen from the ext. of Belladonna, I think they must fail, as the ext. causes inflection, whereas a new lot of Atropine, as well as the (Valerinate?), produce no effect.    (3) I have been trying a good many experiments with heated water.  I got a new chemical therm. and placed the long bulb obliquely, not touching the bottoms of the (?) with 3 oz. of (?) (?) & I (?) (&?) (moved?) (the?) (?) (about?).  A temp. of from 100� to 125� Fahr. causes strong inflections within 10 minutes.  A temp from 80� to 100� causes some inflection, but after a much longer time.  At 130� there is never any inflection, but the leaf is not killed as is proved be subsequent inflection when placed in a Sol. of Carb. of Ammonia; & by re-expansion when afterwards placed in pure water.  The vitality of the leaves is also shown by the aggregation of the protoplasm when the leaves are give Carb. of Amm.  All this holds good until the leaves are heated up to or above 145�.  Between 145� and 151� there is a remarkable change; the glands become as white as porcelain, & there is no inflection, nor aggregation of protoplasm when they are immersed in Carb. of Amm..  Should you not call the following case one of heat rigor?  Two leaves were heated to 130�; and had every tentacle closely inflected; one was taken out and placed in cold water, & it re-expanded; the other was heated to 145�, & had not the least power of re-expansion.  Is not this latter case heat rigor?  If you can inform me, I shd very much like to hear, at what temp. cold-blooded & invertebrate animals are killed.    (4) I must tell you my final result, of which I am sure, of the sensitiveness of Drosaea.  I made a solution of 1 pt of Phosphate of Amm. by weight to 218,750 of water: of this sol. I gave so much that a leaf got 1/8000th of a grain of the phosphate.  I then counted the glands & each cd. have got only 1/1,552,000 of a grain; this being absorbed by the glands sufficed to cause the tentacles (?) (these?) glands to bend thro' an angle of 180�.  Such sensitiveness requires hot weather and carefully selected young, yet mature leaves.  It strikes me as a wonderful fact.  I must add that I took every precaution, by trying numerous leaves at the same time in the sol. & in the same water which was used for making the sol. (5) If you can persuade your friend to try the effects of C. of Amm. on the aggregation of the white blood corpuscles, I shd very much like to hear the result.    I hope this letter will not have wearied you.  Believe me      yours very sincerely          Charles Darwin
1.0000097~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, June 21, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. He is concerned about anomolies between the action of pepsin and the Drosera ferment which he is trying to clear up; has read Sanderson's two articles on Dionaea and fears he has been misunderstood on one point. A.L.S., 2 p.~Array June 21 Down, Beckenham, Kent.  My dear Dr Sanderson  I have received & am heartily obliged for the acids, the fibrin & 2 spec. of fibrous cartilage.- You do not know how valuable the fibrin has proved; both Drosera & Pinguicola have quickly dissolved every atom; so that I cd have fallen into a grievous error & said that neither could wholly dissolve fibrin: No doubt what I saw left undissolved was impurity in the wretched fibrin which I before employed: Thus the great and horrid anomaly is removed. But then remains another, (if I understand rightly), viz that artificial digestive fluid dissolves the fibrous basis of decalcified bone. If this is so I must try Drosera again, as it is just possible that D. would not attack the tissue until it had removed every atom of the phosphate and cd free animal matter.  The second anomaly is about gluten: I prepared it myself by washing it in water till I got my finest pale brown substance; but there may have been some corn starch left, & how I am to extricate this I know not.- I have just read with very great interest your 2 articles on Dionaea: it is most wonderful that there cd be that identity between muscle & a leaf � I fear that you misunderstood me on one point: the aggregation of the protoplasm does not occur until sometime after the movement has occurred. But to look closer to this point has been a subject on my list for closer observation for some little time. Again aggregation occurs with no movement ?, as when too strong a dose (viz 2 or 3 gr. of carbonate of A. to 1 oz) is given. I do not think I expressed in my last note how very much I was pleased by your very kind? & encouraging notice of my work     Yours most sincerely  Ch. Darwin Bottom of page:  Sanderson [written lightly]    P. S. ? may have made a small mistake & has sent me vertebrate bones with no cartilage; but Frank has now come home, & knows fibro-cartilage, & will get me some from a joint or from the Butchers.

"More Letters of Charles Darwin", V. 2, p. 395.~Array Down,  Beckenham, Kent.  Sept 13 1873  My dear Dr. Sanderson  How very kind it was of you to telegraph to me.  I am quite delighted that you have got a decided result.  Is it not a very remarkable fact? It seems so to me in my ignorance. � I wish I could remember more distinctly what I found out of Dr Du Bois Raymond's results � my poor memory never serves me for more than a vague guide. I really think you're right to try Drosera.  In a weak soln of Phosphate of ammonia (1 gr. to 20 oz of water) it will contract in about 5 minutes & even more quickly in pure warm water; but then water, I suppose, wd prevent your trial.- I forget, but I think it contracts pretty quickly (i.e. in a hour or two) with a larger drop of a rather stronger soln of the Phosphate, or with an atom of raw meat on the disc of the leaf.  Very many thanks for your note just received.  Do not hunt up for your copy of your paper: for the R. Inst honoured me some years ago by making me a member, & I find that I have the volume (beginning about ?Atrofina) & which no doubt I formerly read.  Yours most sincerely,  Ch. Darwin

Asks Sanderson to do some more tests with the acids; Darwin wants to test globulin and hydrochloric acid on Drosera. A.L.S., 1 p.~Array March 31st  Down, Beckenham, Kent  My dear Dr. Sanderson.  How carefully & excellently you have made the experiments, which I fear must have cost you much trouble. They will be most useful to me, especially those on the acids & I am greatly obliged to you. There in one point which you do not mention, and which I ought to know, viz the temperature at which the experiments were tried. Drosera digests at ordinary summer temperature, & as far as casual observations serve almost equally well during ordinary summer weather & very hot weather. If you tried your experiments at the heat of human body or above that, it is just possible that the fatty acids would turn a better ? with the hydrochloric at lower temperatures. Would it not be worth while to try one of the fatty acids and the hydrochloric at ordinary temperatures?  Again heartily thanking you   Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin P.S. I do not at present think that I shall try more digestion experiments with Drosera this summer; not but while I like the work much, & your most kind offer is very tempting, but then I have other matter almost ready for publication and which, if I go on, I shall never have strength to publish. P.S. 2  If all the gobulin which I sent had not been used or thrown away, will you return me a few grains, as I shd like to try a few particles on Drosera oiling the plant with a minute drop of very weak hydrochloric acid.

Darwin is sending the plants and suggests any results obtained would be worth publishing by Burdon-Sanderson.; described the nature of the leaf contradictions and the effect of hydrochloric acid on the digestive powers of Drosera. A.L.S. 1 p. Printed in Darwin Frances. "More Letters of Charles Darwin", V. 2, p. 394.~Array Down, Beckenham, Kent.  Tuesday September 9 1873  My dear Dr Sanderson  I will send up early tomorrow two plants with 5 goodish leaves, which you will know by their being tied to sticks.  Please remember that the slightest touch,     even by a hair, of the 3 filaments on each lobe, makes the leaf close, & it will not open for 24 hours. You had better put 1?4 of inch of water into the     saucers of the pots. The plants have been kept too cool in order to retard them.  You had better put them on rather warm (i.e., temp. of warm green house) for a day, & in good light.    I am extremely glad you have undertaken this subject.  If you get a positive result, I should think you ought to publish it separately, & I could quote it;     or I should be most glad to introduce any note by you into my account.  I have no idea whether it is troublesome to try with the thermo-electric pile, any change of temperature when the leaf closes. I could detect none with a common thermometer.  But if there is any change in temperature, I should expect it would occur some 8 to 12 or 24 hrs after the leaf has been given a big     smashed fly, & when it is copiously secreting its acid digestive fluid.  I forgot to say that as far as I can make out, the inferior surface of the leaf is always in a state of tension, & that the contraction is confined to the     upper surface; so that when this contraction ceases or suddenly fails (as by immersions in boiling water) the leaf opens again, or more widely than is     natural to it.-  Whenever you have quite finished I will send for the plants in their basket.  My son Frank is staying at 6 Queen Anne St, & comes home on Sat. afternoon, but you will not have finished by that time  Yours very sincerely  Ch Darwin    P. S. I have repeated my experiment on digestion in Drosera with complete success. By giving leaves a very little weak hydro-chloric acid, I can make them     digest albumen i.e., white of eggs quicker than they can do naturally � I most heartily thank you for all your kindness.  I have been pretty bad lately &     must work very little.

My dear Dr Sanderson  I grieve to find that I kept only a few particles of the globulin & of the so-called haemoglobulin; but I don't think it could be tried on a small ? of the artificial gastric juice.  The case, however, interests me so much, (as well as that of the Mucin) that I thought I wd get some more globulin from Dr Moore if the few particles sent do not suffice & if you do not find the much larger parcel previously sent to you. - I shd be very glad to know what I might to call? the Haemoglobin, that is if you can tell by its appearance.  Perhaps Dr Brunton knows about the digestion of chlorophyll by animals � will you ask him when you ask about gelatine & chondrin; though I daresay some ? is correct that my chondrin was not as pure as the selection prepared by Hoffmann.

He met  me in his entrance and took me upstairs to the usual high  seat in his Drawing Room. He was as usual full of kindness  & ? & said it always did him good to talk with  me. He was sorry I had come so far etc.   He said Mr. F Darwin was about writing a Review for  Nature of Wiessmann's Essay. He had read the Abst. of my  R. S. paper & wished to keep it for F D. to see. He did not  understand a good deal of it. I explained about the ?  transmission. He was interested to hear about Engelmann's  conclusions from his dissection on Muscles as to the mecha-  nism of Contraction.   Then he told me what he had obsd in Dionaea about  the aggregation produced in the cells by the action of weak  sol. of carbonate of ammonia � also about the "ag-  gregation phenom. in Drosera, which Pfeffer had written  to him could not be considered as "protoplasmic" at all.   Then he went on to the Vivisection matter, saying how  gratified he was that an association was being formed  & that he thought it very important that information  should be circulated among medical men for use in informing the Public. He told of a conversation  had had with Mr. Farrer who had been staying with  Chamberlain at Burmingham, who, speaking of  free ?, said that it was certainly useless to  try to argue with people on general principle.

1.00001~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, May 14, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Compares the effects of pepsin and the fatty acids with the effects of the Drosera ferment on fibrin, Albumen and other substances. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Down, Beckenham, Kent  May 14, 1874    My dear Dr Sanderson,    I am very much obliged about the gluten, & what you are going to do is just what I shd have asked, viz. to see whether any indigestible residue is left, for this always happens with gluten on Drosera.  Now that I have written out my notes, by far the greatest anomaly which I found is that fibrin is never wholly dissolved.  Watts says it is not a homogenous substance & I much want you to put a bit of fibrin with an excess of pepsin and propionic or butyric acids (I think the former wd be best as nearest to the acid of drosera) & see whether, at the ordinary temp. of the air the whole of the fibrin is dissolved, or whether a residue is left.  This experiment is of the greatest importance to me, as it will tend to shew whether the failure of Drosera to digest the whole of the fibrin is due to the acid or nature of the ferment. It is possible that the fibrin which I have used (preserved in glycerine) may be bad; wd you therefore be so kind as to put an atom of that herewith sent into pepsin and hydro- chloric A., & see if it is all dissolved like true fibrin.  If mine proves bad, will you send me an atom of good fibrin.  I know well that I am giving you great trouble; but as my notes are now written out I have come to the end of my requests. So I will go on; if you wd try minute cubes of albumen with pepsin and propionic or butyric acids at ordinary temp., the whole ought to be dissolved if the ferment of drosera has the same power as pepsin; & this experiment is manifestly very important for me.  When you tried the globulin prepared by Dr. M., which I sent you, can you remember whether the splinters remained sharp, as happens with Drosera?  I now find that particles of this globulin, left in cold water for 3 days, yields something soluble which acts energetically on Drosera, though the sharpest angles are not rounded by the secretions or by water; & I dare say it was this soluble matter which was dissolved in your experiments with globulin in pepsin and H.A.   Can you send me a bit of fibro-cartilage from any animal, to try on Drosera? I am so ignorant I might blunder, & I have tried cartilage.    Lastly can you spare me a grain or two, or if liquid, a few drops, of  propionic, butyric, valerianic, or oleic Acid? I find immersion in olive oil has a potent effect on Drosera, & I suspect the fatty acids.     Heaven forgive me for making so many requests & believe me yours very sincerely    Ch. [Charles] Darwin

Suggests that Burdon-Sanderson test to see if there is any electrical charge in the leaves of Dionaea when they are excited and offers to provide the plants. A.L.S., 1 p.~Array Letterhead: n/a  Bassett Southampton  My dear Dr. Sanderson  I am much obliged for your letter which has been forwarded to me here � but I return home next Thursday. I assure you I felt quite guilty when I read in the Times your grand address on Physiology, at the thought that I had troubled you, at such a time, with my queries.  I quite understand what you say about heat rigor. I should think that it would be extremely interesting to ascertain whether there is any electrical change in the leaves of Drosera when they are excited; but I should think Dionaea would be much better for the purpose. As far as I can imperfectly make out the lower surface of the leaf in Dionaea, and of the tentacles (i.e. ? tions of the leaf) of Drosera is always in a state of tension, but is over mastered by the contraction of the upper surface alone.  Therefore I imagine that the upper & lower surface would exhibit an electrical change (if such there be) during the act of inflection. Now 'Dionaea, from the large size of the leaf and from the suddenness and greatness of the movement, would be the best to operate on. If on further reflection you are willing to investigate this point, I would gladly send you by a servant plants in good condition; for I suppose you would require to have the plants at the Institute and not at Down.  If you obtained any results, it seems to me that it would be a remarkable discovery and well worth your publishing. I had thought that it might be worthwhile to test Dionaea during inflection by the thermo-electric pile. A common thermometer gave no indication of any rise of temperature, so that it seems very doubtful whether the experiment would be worth trying. If you find you have time and inclination to examine Dionaea or Drosera under the foregoing point of view, please do let me hear.  With many thanks, your very sincerely  Charles Darwin

Heterogeneous fluids can hardly act as a ?, unless indeed they act merely by exciting molecular movements in adjoining molecules; & this view coincides with my conclusion. For atoms of glass, cotton thread (less than 1/50,000 of a grain in weight) excite movement, & what is more confusing cause the fluid contents of cells forming the tentacles to undergo a ? change; & my description of this has so much impressed Huxley, that he is coming down tomorrow night to see the phenomen. � I have put 1 gr. of the ? to dissolve, but it dissolves very slowly when I began to try ? on Drosera, over 12 or 15 years ago, my object was to see whether the poisons affected the plant or if any of its tissues had the same properties, as the newer tissues, of activity; but I was disheartened from want of knowledge, & had not time to go on. I wd never have dreamed of trying glycerine: 4 ? ? to 1 oz. of water causes the tentacles to bend, i.e. those tentacles the glands of which have absorbed a most minute quantity of it. Therefore I expect that tomorrow morning the magnified tentacles will probably be infiltrated.  With cordial thanks  Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin

A.L.S. 1 p.~Array 49 Queen Anne Street  Friday April 30    Dear Mr Darwin,      The day before yesterday Dr L. Playfair called upon me.  He entirely approves of the Bill & is quite prepared to introduce it, in case that should seem to be the best course.  Yesterday he was to see Ld Cardwell and to show it to him. I feel sanguine in hoping that Ld Cardwell will be induced to adopt it for this reason.       Mr. (Colam?), the Secretary of the S. for the P. of C. to A. called on me yesterday and developed to me their scheme.  It appears to be substantially the same as ours (certainly not more (restrictive?)).  They (the Society) regard it as Lord Cardwell's, he having approved of it.  Consequentially I think there is good reason to hope that a compromise will be effected.  As soon as it is effected it would I think be well that it should be known as generally as possible that such a measure has the support of our side.      L.

Sept 14th  My dear Dr. Sanderson  I have been extremely glad to hear what Frank has told me, and I am very much obliged to you for having allowed him to aid you.  It seems a "fine" discovery, and I should think would lead to much further research; I am very glad that you are going to report on it to the Brit. Assoc. Thanks for the paper which I will keep for a week or two, as I find I only have the second part.  And now- I am going to beg a favour of you which I stand in great need of viz. a small quantity of a few pure animal substances, namely fibrin, albumin, mucin, or any others which are tolerably distinct.  Perhaps you could persuade Dr Brunton to aide me in this; of fibrin I want for a distinct and special purpose nearly a drachm but of other substances much less; the fibrin must be absolutely pure of all salts for the special purpose in view- i.e. to excite acid secretion & get the acid ascertained.  Frankland is away, Miller is dead, and Hoffman at Berlin and I now know noone else to whom to apply.  Do you know any professional chemist whom I could pay and who could be trusted to prepare such substances pure?  The reason of my wanting these substances is, that I find absolutely pure gelatine formerly given me by Hoffman, does not cause Drosera to be inflected, though ? does.  Again as far as I have gone (though my experiments are not completed), neither casein nor gluten (from wheatflour) affects drosera.  As meat of all kinds, dead insects of all kinds, and white of egg all act most energetically, I am very anxious to know what pure animal compounds will act � it seems even possible !!! that this subject might throw a little light on animal digestion, for I see old Muller suspects that something more than gastric juice is required to digest certain animal substances.

He wd have signed the certificate had he not been on the Council.    7 White Rock Place. Hastings  Dec 31st 1880    Dear Mr Darwin,  Your letter, with the Certificate, has been forwarded to me here.  I have great pleasure in signing it.  The date of my Friday Evening Lecture, about which you are so kind as to enquire, is February 25. I send a Ticket as a memorandum of the date.  I came here chiefly for the purpose of writing or, at all events, preparing it.  My leading position is that in the excitable parts of plants, the mode by which the excited part influences other parts at a distance from it is (notwithstanding the absence of nerves) essentially the same as in the simpler excitable structures of animals.  Prof Munk of Berlin in his long paper on Dionaea, as well as Sachs, denies the possibility of transmission or propagation of all excitatory effect, excepting by migration of liquid.  I am going to try to make this point plain by a strict comparison of plant water accrual phenomena.  I have been reading more carefully the "Movements of Plants".  I am specially interested in the 6th & 7th chapters.  With best wishes for the New Year  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
1.0000094~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, October 13, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Darwin argues against Burdon-Sanderson's suggestion and presents his own idea for considertion. A.L.S.~Array Down  Beckenham, Kent   Oct 13. 1874  My dear Dr Sanderson  Many thanks for your suggestion but I doubt whether it is sufficient.  The tentacles close very slowly over the 5 specified substances, & this might be accounted for by their pure state.  But the important fact is that they subsequently re-expand so much more quickly than over minute insects, meat albumen etc.  It is chiefly this latter fact which makes me conclude that the 5 substances are but little exciting & probably not very nutritious.  I made so many experiments with gelatine that I can hardly doubt that this conclusion is true with this substance.  Klein speaks (Handbook Phys. p445) as if areolar (or connective) tissue & the fibrous basis of bone, were of a gelatinous nature, & this made me suppose that perhaps fibrin & fibro-cartilage were likewise allied to gelatine; & as gelatine is so little nutritious to animals, I imagine that the little action of these 5 substances on drosera might be thus explained.  My best plan would be, I think, never to call attention to the small power of the 5 substances on drosera, and to say (if you admit the truth of my inference from Klein) areolar tissue & the fibrous basis of bone were allied to gelatine, & that gelatine was little nutritious to animals. I fear from what you say that I may not add that fibrin & fibro-cartilage (& god knows what is the nature of fibro-cartilage?) were likewise allied to gelatine.  If you have anything further to remark I shd be grateful for a note.  With many thanks,  Yours very sincerely,  Ch Darwin
1.0000146~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, April 14, 1875]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 49 Queen Anne Street [London] to Charles Darwin. Suggests Darwin need only write to Lord Derby; rejects the idea of an inspector to inspect experiments involving vivisection. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array 49 Queen Anne  April 14th 1874    Dear Mr Darwin,  I received your letter this morning.  I should think that it wd answer the purpose to write to Lord Derby for also important is that the Government should know that a bill is being sketched & that they must not commit themselves. I had a note today from Sir Robert Christison who after expressing himself very energetically on the subject of the present agitation concludes "There should be no compromise, except to forbid vivisectional demonstrations to classes, which I always thought both useless and cruel".  I have not seen Mr Huxley. The notion of an Inspector appears to me absurd.  It would be in the first place absurd to appoint one man to inspect half a dozen others of at least equal status with himself.  There is no comparison between experimentation and anatomical dissection.  Every student must dissect, but not one in a hundred need take part in any vivisection.  Moreover an Inspector would be of no use in putting a stop to domestic experimentation.  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson

He will write to Lyon Playfair about the bill; speaks of his attitude towards proposed inspectors, has sent some notes to Litchfield about the bill. A.L.S.~Array 49 Queen Anne St  April 23rd    Dear Mr Darwin      I received your letter this morning.  I have read & (noted?) the contents of the (?) which I return to you.      I will write to Lyon Playfair asking him to see me after he has read the Bill, which you will have sent him.      I think (his?)

Places cannot be made responsible, so that licensing them would not prevent abuses, supposing such to be likely to occur.      I have not yet received Dr. (?)'s signature.  Otherwise we have them all.  I cannot (after careful consideration) see that it would be advisable to suppress his petition.      I have sent some notes to Mr. Litchfield on his (IInd?) section - particularly (4) i.e. the last paragraph.

1.0000083~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, May 5, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Thanks Burdon-Sanderson for acid experiments with gluten, dentine, enamel, and fibrin.~Array May 5  My dear Dr. Sanderson  I had such a lot of letters to write that I did not at once thank you for the acid experiments, which will do splendidly to print just as you have sent them. I shall be very curious to hear about gluten which I see in Watts Chem. Dict. is a very complex product. It contains something which excites Drosera greatly, but it is not all dissolved like albumen.  I am now trying dentin & enamel; As far as I can yet provisionally see the secretion does not touch the enamel, but decalcifies the dentin without dissolving the fibrous tissue; but I shall know more in a week's time, when the leaves have done all that they can.  I suppose the Drosera with be beaten & that gastric juice will dissolve decalcified fibrous tissue of bone.  I find the Drosera can do little with fibrin; but when I have written out all my notes, & see what I actually know, I will apply for some, to me, invaluable aid.  Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin
1.0000087~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, March 21, 1874]~Charles Darwin, "Down"  to John Burdon-Sanderson. Encloses his manuscript on Dionaea for Burdon-Sanderson to read. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array Down,  Beckenham, Kent.  March 21 1874  My dear Dr Sanderson  I send registered by this post my M. S. on the habits of the Dionaea.  If you have patience to read it, you will perhaps find something useful for your lecture, as some parts seem to me curious.  I have not attended to style, only to intelligibility, but I have endeavoured to my utmost to be accurate.  Please sometime do return the M. S. as it will serve to be hereafter licked into shape � You must understand that my observations were intended only as complementary to those on Drosena.  If I were in your place, I shd get my wife to read the M. S. aloud to me, but if Mrs Sanderson hears of this hint, she will say that I am an unfeeling wretch  Yours very sincerely,  Ch. Darwin P. S. My son Frank wd be delighted to attend as your assistant at your lecture, if this wd be of any use to you.
1.0000133~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, March 23, 1874]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 49 Queen Anne Street [London] to Charles Darwin. Thanks Darwin for the manuscript; he will send the results of the digestion experiments tomorrow. A.L.S.,  1 p.~Array 49, Queen Anne Street.  March 23    Dear Mr Darwin    My very best thanks for the M. S. It will be invaluable to me.  We are just now, many winter lectures at University College being over, looking forward to spending a week among the spring flowers. We shall take the M.S. with us. And my wife will read it to me just as you propose or perhaps I shall read it & dictate notes to her.  Please thank your son Frank for his kind offer of help of which I shall certainly avail myself.  All the experiments about digestion are com- plete. I will try to send them tomorrow.  Believe me,  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
1.0000096~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, March 30, 1874]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 49 Queen Anne Street [London] to Charles Darwin. Some notes on the results of experiments about digestion which are enclosed. A.L.S. 1 p.~Array 49, Queen Anne Street.  March 30    Dear Mr Darwin  I sent you the results of our experiments. I attach much more importance to those relating to the three fatty acids than to the rest. They were very carefully made and yielded sharply defined results.  They shew that each of these acids possesses the power of enabling pepsin to act on fibrin though in less degree than hydrochloric acid.  If you make further experiments with the plants this summer, I would like to cheque them by comparison with pepsin digestion.     Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
1.0000153~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, May 14, 1879]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 26 Gordon Square [London] to Charles Darwin. Answers his queries about the Baly Medal. A.L.S. 2 p.~Array 26, Gordon Square, W.C.  May 14th, 1879    Dear Mr. Darwin  I have this Monday received your note.  It would have arrived yesterday had it not been addressed to Queen Anne Street.  The Baly in whose memory the medal was instituted was the translator of Muller's Physiology.  The donor of the Medal Fund is Mr Dyster, a friend of Baly's and a man much interested in physiology, though not himself a     naturalist.  The medal bears the words "Ob physiologiam feliciter excultam".  It is given every other year. The last recipient was Ludwig, the previous one Bernard & the previous one Sharpey.  If you feel that it wd be too fatiguing to attend at the college it is not by any means indispensable that you should do so.  Neither Bernard nor Ludwig were     present.  If you do come it will be a great pleasure to your friends.  The only penalty that you would have to pay would be that of having to listen for an hour to the Harveian orator.      My neighbour Dr Pitman the Registrar of the College assures me that it could be easily arranged that you should come by at the end of the hour, in case you     feel that this would be too fatiguing. It is not necessary (I again write on the authority of the Registrar) for the Medalist to say anything in acknowledgment.  The Medal is presented immediately     after the oration. I may add that Mr Dyster has expressed his extreme gratification at the selection this College have made on the present occasion.  I am Dear Mr Darwin  Yours truly  JB Sanderson
1.0000102~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, July 16, 1875]~Charles Darwin, "Down" to John Burdon-Sanderson. Had read Burdon-Sanderson's latest essays; will modify some of the passages in the chapters on digestion; is worried about what critics will say about it. A.L.S. 2 p.~Array Down,  Beckenham, Kent.  Railway Station,  Orpington, S.E.R.    July 16 75    My dear Sanderson  I have read your essays with the greatest interest & am much obliged to Mrs. Sanderson for having sent them. I had no idea that so much light had been thrown on the subject. If Dr. Bastian knew of these articles he has not written quite fairly in his recent articles. I wish your essay had been longer & that you had said something about Mr. Lister's observations. I remember being astonished at the cool way in which Dr. Bastian spoke of life being always destroyed at 150 degrees, with organisms living in hot springs staring him in the face. Some little time ago Mr. Simon sent me the last Report, & your statements about contagion deeply interested me. By the way, if you see Mr. Simon, & can remember it, will you thank him for me, I was so busy at the time that I did not write. Having been in correspondence with Paget lately on another subject, I mentioned to him an analogy which has struck me much, now that we know that sheep pox is fungoid; & this analogy pleased him. It is that of fairy rings which are believed to spread from a centre & when they intersect, the intersecting portion dies out, as the mycelium cannot grow where it has grown, during previous years. So again I have never seen a ring within a ring this seems to me parallel case to a man commonly having the smallpox only once. I imagine that in both cases the mycelium must consume all the matter on which it can subsist.  With respect to Drosera I will modify the passages about globulin etc, but I thought I had made it pretty clear that these substances were not pure; & they to a certain extent answered my purpose in showing that they were acted on in the same manner by Drosera and gastric juice. I did not know Dr. Moore was dead otherwise I should have spoken more plainly. I do not know anyone who could attempt to separate the ferment, & I suppose there would be the greatest difficulty in doing so, as all my observations lead me to believe that the ferment is not secreted until some nitrogenous matter has been absorbed; & would not the addition of such matter make the separation extremely difficult? I feel a good deal of anxiety to know what competent critics may say about my chapter on digestion.    My dear Sanderson  Yours very sincerely    Ch. Darwin
1.0000144~[Letter, Charles R. Darwin to John Burdon-Sanderson, April 30, 1876]~Charles Darwin, 6 Queen Anne Street to John Burdon-Sanderson. Makes a suggestion how Sanderson may use his machine test arterial action. A.L.S., 1 p.~Array 6 Queen Anne St. Sunday 9 30th My dear Sanderson I have read the two papers with the greatest interest. It is a grand discovery. If I understand rightly, you will presently have the machine for enclosing an arm & observing arterial action. Should you try any experiments with the machine, & if you think the following one worth trying, I should be particularly glad. It is to test (as suggested by my son Frank) my hypothetical notion on the origin of blushing, namely that thinking intently about any part of the surface of the body tends to relax the arteries in that part. You wd probably think of some better scheme than I could; but I may suggest that a man's arm shd be enclosed & his attention directed intensely to his feet; & then that he shd be induced to think as intensely as possible about the whole surface of his arm. This might be perhaps best done by some hum bug, vis. by asking him to attend to any creeping sensation, or of heat or cold, over the whole surface of the arm, asking him to declare instantly as soon as he felt any such sensation. Mr. H. (?) Holland remarked to me long ago, that if you thought intensely about any part such as a knuckle or finger, it felt cool as if a breeze were blowing on it, & if my memory does not deceive me, I tried this & found it true. Believe me Yours very sincerely, Charles Darwin

1.0000142~[Letter, John Burdon-Sanderson to Charles R. Darwin, February 12, 1875]~J. Burdon-Sanderson, 49 Queen Anne Street [London] to Charles Darwin. Answers Darwin's queries about the digestion of phosphates; he is now circulating a memorandum on vivisection which could become the basis of a petition. A.L.S. 1 p.~ Feb 12/75    Dear Mr Darwin,  Potassium phosphate is certainly decomposed in the animal body.  A double decomposition no doubt takes place between it and common salt which is always     present by virtue of which potassium chloride & sodium phosphate are produced. It appears to me likely that the reason why potassium phosphate does not act upon Drosera is this � that it is present in considerable proportion in the     juices of plants & consequently probably in Drosera.  I think it would be found that to those salts which are present in the plant it is indifferent, even though it may be excited by others which are chemically closely allied to them.  With reference to the subject of experiments on animals, I have after conversation with Mr Huxley prepared a memorandum intended to serve as the basis of a Petition.  It is now in his hands.  I have lately been considering very     carefully the whole question and am of course very anxious that if anything is done, it should be done in such a way as to promote rather than to hinder the     progress of science.  Believe me, Dear Mr Darwin  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
