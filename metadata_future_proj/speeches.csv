1.0107468~Crossing borders, contesting values : do universities matter? Presidential address, Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, Vancouver, BC~Toope, Stephen J.~Crossing Borders, Contesting Values: Do Universities Matter? Presidential Address Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences Vancouver, BC  Prof. Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  3 June 2008  1  [Thank you, Professor Golfman, for the kind and overly generous introduction.]  It is an honour to speak before such a diverse group of my peers. I really appreciate the opportunity to think about some big questions facing our country and our country’s universities. Most citizens imagine the life of the university professor as one of relative ease where one is given free scope to think deeply on matters of sheer curiosity. We know that such opportunities are actually a luxury with all the demands of teaching, publishing deadlines and service to our various communities. They are even more of a luxury for a university president, but I do my level best to carve out time to think, so the challenge of giving this address is a welcome one. I will be considering the role of universities in crossing borders and in fostering the robust contestation of values.  I am a scholar of international law, so I have spent much of my working life thinking about borders. For all of its modern history, borders have defined international law: borders between states and borders between disciplines. The first point is obvious. What we now consider to be international law emerged in the period after the formation of nationstates. That process began with the Peace of Westfalia in 1648, but reached its apogee in the super-nationalist and colonialist nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. International law was seen by most 2  practitioners of the discipline as a product of state consent, so law could only shape the intercourse across borders; it did not challenge borders, but reinforced them. In parallel, the discipline carved out a role for itself as the handmaiden of power. It facilitated the will of states, but seldom got in the way.  In part because international law was essentially deferential to state power throughout much of the modern era, it connected only slightly to other cognate academic disciplines. It had little theory, so was not strongly connected to sociology or economics. It was resolutely if unambitiously normative, so connected poorly with purely interest-based conceptions of politics. It was neither a social science, for it had little method, nor a humanities discipline, because it was so resolutely pragmatic.  And yet, throughout that same period of history, international lawyers have invoked the “international community” as both the source and object of public international law.i The assumption is that if there is no community, there can be no law because it is only in community that the expectation of compliance with law can be generated. The community that is said to generate public international law is a highly particular one: the community of sovereign states. However, in recent times the scope of international law has been steadily expanding so that today, in the 3  words of Wilfred Jenks “it represents the common law of mankind in an early state of development, of which the law governing the relations between states is one, but only one, major division.”ii  Jenks’ assertion that public international law can now be regarded as an emergent “common law of mankind” reveals the tensions in the concept of the “international community”. For a rich and detailed common law to develop, it is indeed likely that some form of community is required. But in the post-modern era, where pluralism is said to be a defining feature of many national societies, can one expect that global society will be marked by a unity approaching any realistic understanding of community?  No doubt, by now many of you are getting worried. “Am I at the right talk?” you may be asking. “What has international law got to do with crossing borders, contesting values and universities?” you could be wondering. Please bear with me for just a minute more.  In adapting international law throughout the twentieth century, and focusing more and more on individuals as beneficiaries rather than mere subjects of the law, one of the primary goals of international legal theorists was to promote greater legal responsibility for international actors. Throughout the last century successful efforts were made to 4  impose responsibility upon individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity, to promote the responsibility of states and private persons for violations of human rights, and to establish responsibility for breaches of international environmental protection rules.  Over the last fifty years or so, international lawyers have, albeit imperfectly, broadened their horizons and re-imagined the scope of their field of study and practice. Here’s the punch line: universities are, I think, going through parallel processes of transformation. Some of us are groping towards a conception of the university’s role and responsibilities that crosses disciplinary borders and helps increase the permeability of state borders. But we are constrained by two powerful forces: lingering positivist sensibilities that reinforce content-determined conceptions of education; and difficulty in escaping the nationalist sensibilities that provide comfort amidst social complexity.  I want to argue today that just as international law has finally found some liberation in inter-disciplinary connections and in a transcendence of state borders, universities can rediscover their own promise in analogous transformations. Don’t get me wrong. I am not one of those “futurologists” who thinks that universities are outmoded or unable to meet the needs of contemporary society or the modern economy. Let’s put our challenges in perspective: along with religious foundations and 5  structures, universities are one of the only social institutions that have remained recognizable from the medieval period to this day. Universities have not been “ivory towers” at all; they have adapted in function and organization. Our medieval forebears would find it hard to imagine a university that teaches engineers and commerce students. The idea that universities might be “patent powerhouses” as UBC was recently described, would of course be unimaginable. Universities opening up community-service learning opportunities for a thousand students in schools and social service agencies and advocacy NGOs throughout the city and across the world, as UBC does every year, would be puzzling.  Yet over hundreds of years, universities have also found ways to retain and build strength through robust processes of peer review, and the cumbersome but essential attributes of collegial governance. So our own experience of the university, and that of our students, draws on a rich and remarkably stable tradition, while reflecting the evolution that has occurred over generations. My point is that while respecting our powerful traditions, there are, I think, particular opportunities in our generation to add to the strength that we have inherited. Those opportunities relate to the crossing of borders, both state and disciplinary. But, and here is the real road block in our way, I suspect that we are collectively afraid to cross some borders because we are 6  reluctant to enter onto the no-man’s land of contested values. But if university people don’t enter that land, not only will we fail to make the gains that our generation owes our forebears and our successors, we will also fail our societies, our students and ourselves.  Let me return to my own discipline one last time. The distinguished Finnish international legal scholar, Martti Koskenniemi, argues that international law remains today “a terrain of fear and ambition, fantasy and desire, conflict and utopia, and a host of other aspects of the phenomenological lives of its practitioners”.iii I could not imagine a more subtle definition of the terrain we all face in a university as well. We have to take up the challenge as a matter of responsibility, both professional and social. Our first responsibility may be to dream.  So let’s dream together for a moment. Imagine that our universities in Canada decided that we had a profound responsibility to address some fundamental problems of our era. We would not forego our commitment to curiosity-driven research, which needs constant buttressing, but we would build on that commitment in certain key areas. Imagine further that we might agree on what some of those fundamental, generational, problems are. I know that this would be difficult in a pluralistic university setting, but as a thought experiment, let me suggest two that should be on any list for debate: the need to move rapidly to a 7  radically more sustainable environment, economy and society; and the need to help new generations of Canadians navigate deep cultural and religious diversity, both within and without our national borders.  UBC is a globally recognized leader in sustainability practice and research. But even here, where much has been accomplished, we know that there is so much more that we could do. One of the significant constraints is our traditional departmental structures. We have people working on closely related scientific issues of sustainability within Science, Engineering, Medicine, Forestry, and Land and Food Systems. At the same time, English lit scholars, political scientists and sociologists, to name but a sampling, work on the cultural and social aspects of sustainability. All too often, we don’t work collaboratively. At times, we even duplicate efforts and argue at cross purposes, without being aware that we are doing so.  For many of you, I know that I have no need to make a case for inter- or trans-disciplinary work. (I refuse to argue about the most appropriate terminology for reaching across disciplinary borders). Much crossdisciplinary work is already taking place. Literary theorists are exploring philosophy and linguistics. Political scientists are researching into sociology and even law. Ethicists are trying to understand the intricacies of medical decision-making and corporate structure. In many 8  universities we are seeing an explosion of interdisciplinary master’s and doctoral programmes. Doctoral committees even within traditional departments are becoming more heterogeneous. I could go on.  We have made progress. As a university president, I have the great privilege of being exposed to the hundreds of places around us where true interdisciplinary work is being pursued. At UBC, our Human Early Learning Partnership draws together some of Canada’s finest researchers in early brain plasticity, population health, developmental psychology, education and epidemiology. Our Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability undertakes research on water, ecosystems and communities; energy, technology, health and society; and local and global environmental change.  But there is so much more to be done. Let me return to the fundamental problem of environmental, economic and social sustainability. Why are so many of our undergraduate students called upon to make all the connections themselves, and to do the integrating and synthesizing? Why are they the ones who must bridge artificial gaps? Why are so many of our programmes so credit-intensive that students simply can’t take the opportunity to explore outside limited fields? Why do we replicate the same courses in various departments, rather than trying to find ways to share resources and create more diverse learning 9  communities for our students? Why do young professors with joint appointments fear they won’t get tenure? Why are “interdisciplinary” programmes and research centres so often disconnected from undergraduate teaching? Why do such programmes and centres often have trouble finding intellectual space within faculties? Why can’t professors in the same discipline, but with appointments in different faculties, teach core courses in the “other” faculty? We are simply not doing a good enough job marshalling the incredible resources at our disposal; we are not making the difference in our society that we could. We are not fully meeting our responsibility to serve the local, provincial, national, and international communities  How are we doing on the second great problem that I identified in my thought experiment, helping new generations to navigate deep cultural diversity? Despite the commitment that we at UBC have made to helping our students become “exceptional global citizens”, the achievement to date is too limited. Yes, it is true that we have more students studying Mandarin than any other university in North America. We are already Canadian leaders in community-service learning, thanks in part to the pioneering efforts of our Learning Exchange, focused in Vancouver’s downtown east side. We have no less than four student residences shared with universities from other parts of the world, with another opening this year, ensuring robust interaction between Canadian 10  and foreign students. Our Go Global initiatives are opening up diverse international co-op and exchange opportunities for our students. Our researchers in BC publish proportionately more papers with colleagues outside Canada than do researchers in other provinces. We at UBC cross national borders more extensively than could have been imagined only a generation ago.  And yet, it is still possible for a UBC student to graduate without having thought seriously about how her field of study relates to the fundamental challenges of our day. It is not only political scientists, lawyers, geographers, and sociologists who need to think about immigration policy, the role of radicalized religion and Canada’s potential role in promoting global sustainability. It is our doctors, our mathematicians, our engineers. Canada’s egregious failures in recognizing and then supporting healthy aboriginal societies is a topic for all students, not only those in “first nations” programmes. Why is it that our students so often have to take the lead in forcing critical reflection? They vote to support student refugees through the World University Service of Canada. They create Engineers Without Borders.  Some of our programmes are so focused on the detail of specific subjects that the forest is lost for the trees. Even with all our new global programmes, only a small minority of our students will have an 11  opportunity to work or study outside Canada during the pursuit of an undergraduate degree. We in Canada have nothing comparable to the well-funded Erasmus programme that facilitates student mobility in Europe. The decision of our federal government to top up some Canada Graduate Fellowships to allow international exchange is very welcome, but it is only a modest beginning.  Despite the clear imperatives, we in universities often have trouble crossing disciplinary and national borders. I have used UBC examples, but as a proud President, it is incumbent upon me to say that I actually think that UBC does a better job crossing borders than most universities. That is one of the main reasons I was attracted to come here. My point is that no Canadian institution is doing a good enough job. I will conclude by offering a few observations as to why we seem to have such difficulties.  Let me emphasize, however, that we should not be too hard on ourselves. Remember that my thought experiment was to choose two of the greatest challenges of our generation. It is not easy for anyone to address such challenges. The existing social, cultural and financial constraints are significant. In trying to cross disciplinary borders, we confront our own past education, our past practices and our formal structures, the latter being the issue that we should be able to do most 12  about. But none of these speed bumps is un-passable. As I stressed at the outset, universities have already changed dramatically in the last few hundred years. We can continue to evolve. Rather than talking about our failures, it might be more productive to examine the places where substantial change took place, and to learn from those experiences. How did we manage to move engineering from an apprentice system into the academic fold? How did it become possible for feminist perspectives to fundamentally challenge the practices of our conservative institutions? How did the concept of a liberal arts education emerge from church- and state-centred medieval instruction in England, or from the Humboltian research model of Germany?  Of course, there will be no single explanation for these moments of change. But I suspect that there may be some common denominators, worthy of further research. Let me offer only two of the possible explanations: First, I repeat that universities are not ivory towers; they respond, as do all social institutions, to forces of interactive human discourse. Liberal arts education emerged to respond to the needs of fast changing societies in North America that required flexible thinkers more than technicians. It grew with the need to expedite higher education for vets after the Second World War. Feminist campaigns in society at large found fertile ground in universities where women students began  13  to claim a place and where a few feminist pioneers showed how cultural change was possible.  Second, universities change because ideas matter and leaders in universities persuade each other of important new ideas. Leaders are not necessarily those in the formal hierarchy. I have no doubt that at UBC one of the most influential leaders in recent times was Michael Smith, a Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. His passionate commitment to scientific collaboration led to the recruitment of brilliant young researchers and to the creation of collaborative teams that are still working at the forefront of science eight years after Michael’s death. Today, at UBC, it is leaders like John Robinson and James Tansey who will drive collaborative sustainability research.  We also need to work on improving our university structures in dealing with areas like sustainability that transcend specific content domains. Our historical structures should not define our future possibilities. At UBC we created the Michael Smith Labs to facilitate certain kinds of interdisciplionary scientific interaction. The humanities and social sciences require similar initiatives, as do areas of study that bridge across science and the arts.  14  In trying to cross national borders, we face equally daunting challenges. Even though we may seek to become “global citizens” I think that it is important to start with a frank acknowledgement: we do not now, nor are we ever likely to live within, a true global “community.” But this is no cause for despair. In her influential book Justice and the Politics of Difference, Iris Marion Young describes the gift found in what she terms “city life”:  By “city life” I mean a form of social relations which I define as the being together of strangers. In the city persons and groups interact within spaces and institutions they all experience themselves as belonging to, but without those interactions dissolving into unity or commonness. City dwelling situates one’s own identity and activity in relation to a horizon of a vast variety of other activity… City dwellers are thus together, bound to one another, in what should be and sometimes is a single polity. Their being together entails some common problems and common interests, but they do not create a community of shared final ends, of mutual identification and reciprocity.iv  Unintentionally perhaps, Young here presents a compelling description of global society, and what the much-vaunted processes of globalization mean for universities today. Our inability to find or create global 15  community does not preclude practical associations. We must cross borders in new ways, not looking to dominate or simply to find mirrors of ourselves. The irony of globalization, of course, is that at precisely the moment when we have stronger methods of communication and interchange than even before in human history, we are prosecuting a socalled war on terror that divides and alienates, and we typically treat inter-societal relations as matters of competition, not as opportunities for collaboration.  I worry that there may be an even bigger block that prevents us at universities from crossing both disciplinary and national borders. That is the fear generated in fully embracing our traditional role as sites for the contestation of values. Let me be blunt: I worry that Canadian universities are too often places where we shy away from the social realities of deep diversity, where we try to find consensus before we allow for the spirited dialogue that sharpens understanding, where comfort is prized over robust and challenging debate. I don’t mean debate over our respective rights and privileges as members of an elite community; we are often very good at that. I mean fundamental debates about the future of our society and of our places within it.  The kind of deep diversity reflected in Iris Marion Young’s description of city life is often uncomfortable. When we try to reach out from our 16  own disciplines to others, we can feel rebuffed and judged. I certainly know that its lack of a distinctive methodology makes law an easy target for economists who understandably complain about law’s lack of parsimony in argument. For political theorists who adopt rational choice approaches, the same critique of law is inevitable.  Scholars can be a inward-looking lot. Instead of generating robust debate, our disciplinary certainties can lead to dialogues of the deaf, or to mere “tolerance” of diverse views without real engagement. The latter is the more common Canadian disease, in my experience. If we are really going to bridge disciplines and open up new ways of addressing the fundamental challenges of our generation, we need to be more truly interested in diverse theoretical presuppositions, less inclined to prove others wrong or to simply condescend. We should be actively exploring points of complementarity and synergy.  In crossing political borders, we need to move beyond mere “tolerance” as well. Canadians are pretty good at tolerance. We are not so good at principled, but open-minded engagement with people whose values are not entirely compatible with our own. I sit on the international relations committee of the AUCC. Last year, in preparing for a new submission to CIDA, we had cause to review the full panoply of international development engagements of Canadian universities. I was shocked to 17  discover the paucity of Canadian university engagement with universities, NGO’s or governments in the Muslim world. Our international profile, as a Canadian university community, is safe and quite predictable. It is also quite similar to the engagement patterns of our US counterparts.  Similarly, when one reviews the choices that Canadian university students make in where to pursue exchanges or co-op work opportunities, the picture is again largely one of comfort and predictability. We have thousands of students in Europe, the US and Australasia, but most of our universities struggle to fill available slots at Asian, African or Latin American institutions. Part of the problem is weak language skills. Much as we may like to make fun of Americans who speak only English, our students are typically no better, with the exception of francophone Quebeckers, who more commonly speak English, and quite often another romance language as well. I wonder how many fluent Arabic or Mandarin speakers are graduating from Canadian universities this year who did not learn one of those languages at home?  On our own campuses where, in major cities at least, we like to talk about the incredible diversity of our student bodies, I must ask how much interaction there really is between groups of students from 18  different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. Not just casual interaction, of course, but interaction that advances cultural sensitivity and understanding. In moments of quiet reflection, I have heard many UBC students admit that there is too little interaction. It is common in some programmes for students of European ancestry or Chinese students to stick together in their own quasi-ethnic or linguistic groupings. I strongly suspect that we are not alone in this social pattern. On many campuses across the country we have also seen attempts to prevent scholars and political figures associated with particular ethnic or religious groups, or those espousing specific non-violent views, from speaking. Shamefully, in my view, we have not always sided with the principles of open debate and the robust contestation of values.  To conclude my thought experiment, I want to suggest that Canadian universities matter greatly to our prospects for a healthier society, both in Canada and globally. I think that we might just be able to agree that we should play a role in addressing the fundamental problems of our generation. We might even agree that two of those problems are the need to move rapidly to a radically more sustainable environment, economy and society; and the need to help new generations of Canadians navigate deep cultural and religious diversity. To meet our potential and our responsibility, though, we at Canadian universities need to work harder to cross borders, both disciplinary and national. To 19  do that, I suspect that we will have to confront our Canadian fear of controversy and robust debate. If Canadian universities fully claim the terrain as sites for the rich contestation of values, we might just become the deeply influential social institutions that we aspire to be.  i  A.

1.0107479~Vancouver Board of Trade Speech, 2009~Toope, Stephen J.~VANCOUVER BOARD OF TRADE SPEECH Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia September 29, 2009  THINKING AND DRIVING: How UBC is a Key Driver of the BC Economy  Preamble Thanks very much, Dan.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Board of Trade, guests and generous sponsors, it‟s an honour and a pleasure to be downtown with you today: to keep our annual date, to have this opportunity to speak with you, and to share a delicious meal. I did notice there was no wine with lunch, and I wondered if perhaps there had been some concerns over the title of my presentation: “Thinking and Driving.” That‟s “THINKING and Driving.”  A bit of a risk, I suppose, now that I consider it, “Thinking and Driving” as a title. Especially so with tens of thousands of 18-22-year-olds under my charge who, had any of them caught me rehearsing these remarks, might have been inclined to hear something quite different and perhaps misunderstand my enthusiasm.  In fact, maybe I should explain how I chose “Thinking and Driving” for today:  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 1  It goes back to early summer, at a meeting with our Board of Governors, as we were talking about UBC‟s new strategic plan. At the heart of the plan is research, along with student learning and community engagement. UBC‟s core “business,” in other words, is to generate new knowledge, ideas, and innovations with the input and support of the community, and then to share that knowledge with, and in service of, the broader community. That‟s the job of a research-intensive university today.  At this point, one of our Board members leaned forward into her microphone and said, with a kind of envious sigh, “It must be so nice to just think for a living.”  With the utmost respect to our Board member and gratitude for a great title: It‟s time for a new story for UBC. A story without an ivory tower in it, where people supposedly disconnected from a „real world‟ „just think for a living.‟ A new story that gets at the very real intellectual, social, and yes, economic role a research university plays in the regional economy. A story set amidst deep forest, open ocean, and boundless skies that encourage the kind of radical, innovative, breakthrough thinking … that changes economies as it changes our society and, indeed, our world. New information has come to light in recent weeks that has caused even those of us who‟ve dedicated our working lives to academia to significantly revise our views of the University‟s place in British Columbia‟s social and economic fabric.  I look around this room and I see friends—individuals and representatives of organizations that have supported UBC in many powerful ways over the years. This new  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 2  information presents me with an opportunity to say „thank you‟ all over again, this time demonstrating in economic terms the profound impact your support has had.  More than that, when you leave here today, I want you to carry with you a radically new perception of The University of British Columbia. I‟m willing to bet that for many of you—perhaps most of you—UBC hasn‟t necessarily figured into your day-to-day business activities or your strategic thinking. But the information I have to share with you today tells me that it should. Why? A BC Business Council report for the Outlook 2020 Summit Series demonstrated the key role of universities in the knowledge economy. The news was picked up by The Vancouver Sun. Again, why? The same reason: Because in a knowledge economy, if you think for a living, it turns out you have a claim on a driver‟s seat.  A little history. It‟s customary for a university president to commission an economic impact study of his or her institution every decade or so. The point is generally to reassure government funders that their investment is being stewarded wisely.  About a year ago, I saw that UBC‟s last study was coming up to its best-before date, so I spoke with economist Walter Sudmant, Director of UBC‟s Planning and Institutional Research division, and commissioned a new study. But the document he handed me at the end of a year‟s work was not an update of the previous study. It was a whole new animal.  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 3  Sudmant used a formula developed by economist Fernand Martin to measure Canadian university R&D at a national level, and which had so far been applied institutionally only by the University of California. So the report I held in my hands included something that had never before figured into a Canadian university impact study: the economic impact of new knowledge created at UBC.  I was stunned. For the first time, we could consider—and measure—not just the economic impact of UBC‟s corollary activities as an employer and a purchaser, but also the impact of our core business: higher education and knowledge creation. The idea is revolutionary. Moreover, the numbers are astonishing. They indicate that UBC is not merely an economic player, but a driver, and that the magnitude of impact occurs not in spite of the University‟s core business but because of it.  Excited by the implications, and thinking the new economic impact study would make an ideal subject for this event, I called Dan Muzyka at Sauder a few weeks ago to get his thoughts. “Dan,” I said, “I‟ve been thinking about this year‟s address to the Board of Trade, and ….” Dan interrupted me at that point and said, “Times are tough out there right now, Stephen. Whatever you do: Don’t mention the economy!”  Well… Sorry, Dan! The 2009 economic impact study of the University of British Columbia shows that UBC‟s measurable contribution to the economy of the Province of British Columbia in the previous year was ten billion, fifty-seven million dollars—or roughly five percent of  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 4  the provincial economy. By way of a benchmark, that‟s above Mining, and Oil & Gas Extraction and just below Construction. By way of another benchmark, provincial funding for UBC for this time period was roughly one billion dollars. So what we‟re looking at for 2008/2009 is a government spending multiplier … of 10.  What‟s even more radical than that multiplier number, though, is the character of the multiplier as it‟s applied to the University‟s core business. It‟s this factor that changed my view of UBC‟s economic role and will, I hope, change yours.  I‟d like to walk you briefly through the key components of the formula that led to that ten-billion-dollar result. And then what I really want to focus on is the last: research. Because there are characteristics unique to Canadian, research-intensive universities— and specifically UBC—that make „thinking and driving‟ go hand in hand.  So the formula. The 2009 study measured the following dimensions of economic impact:  First, UBC‟s direct spending in the local economy—salaries, books, capital spending. Using a standard, conservative multiplier—in other words, a Keynesian multiplier—of 1.5, the impact of direct spending was $1.9 billion.  Second, non-university spending that would not have occurred without UBC‟s presence, including student and visitor spending. Again using a standard multiplier of 1.5, indirect spending totaled $618 million.  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 5  Third, the effect of higher earnings. Full-time workers with bachelor‟s degrees earn 57 percent more than those who have not completed university. What‟s more, UBC produces all BC-trained doctors, dentists, physical therapists, pharmacists and midwives, and about three quarters of all BC-trained engineers and other professionals, so the 57 percent differential is conservative for UBC graduates. Netting out the actual cost of education, the impact of increased income for UBC alumni was $2.6 billion.  That puts us at five billion and some millions—and we still have one more category to go:  Research. The creation of new knowledge. Ideas and innovations that become part of the curriculum, or part of the vernacular, in classrooms, communities, and corporations from that point forward. The creation and transmission of new knowledge increases the productive capacity of the region and nation, and in doing so, it fundamentally alters the very nature of the economy. The standard Keynesian multiplier just does not apply.  So instead, we used Fernand Martin‟s formula. Here‟s why. It‟s long been observed that there is a substantial component of economic growth that cannot be explained by growth in inputs. Labour and capital both have become more productive for reasons not accounted for. Evidence shows that this additional productivity is the result of innovation, or “technical change,” resulting from the research and development of new products and processes. The effect of innovation is not static but rather dynamic, in that a new  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 6  communications technology or a viral gene sequence fundamentally alters the way things are done. Moreover, the productivity contributions of knowledge are not single-year effects, but become permanent sources of GDP either until that knowledge is supplanted by new knowledge, or in perpetuity. And finally, research and development in British Columbia is conducted to a disproportionately high degree by UBC.  When all of these factors are accounted for, the impact of UBC research and development—core University business—on the British Columbia economy is $4.96 billion.  The characteristics that have led us to become one of the top-ranked universities in the world are in fact the same characteristics that have led us to become an economic driver for British Columbia. An outstanding innovation record. Students, staff, and faculty who could go anywhere in the world but choose UBC. And the exceptional quality of our research. Let‟s take a closer look.  A top-tier, research-intensive university—and particularly UBC—is necessary to the strength and success of a regional economy by virtue of three key characteristics: 1. We are an impetus for the innovation that drives productivity growth in British Columbia and Canada; 2. We help create a provincial climate and geography of innovation that attracts the world‟s top talent; and  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 7  3. Our core contributions to the economy are not static but dynamic inputs, or innovation inputs, the impact of which continues over time.  Impetus for innovation. Geography of innovation. And innovation inputs. Let‟s start by looking at the Impetus for Innovation.  Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, recently quoted Peter Nicholson of the Council of Canadian Academies saying, “innovation is … the main driver of productivity growth and is thus the principal source of national prosperity.” Calling innovation an economic rather than a purely scientific activity, he then said, “Canada has a serious productivity growth problem” and commented on the fact that “Canada‟s business sector on the whole … is lagging in innovation relative to many of our peer[s].” He called on businesses to put in place the strategies that would allow them to foster innovation.  Closer to home, the BC Technology Industry Association has called on industry and government to create a joint strategy for the technology sector that includes a healthy innovation pipeline and ecosystem.  In late July, Maclean’s Paul Wells pinpointed two clear needs: one, for funders and investors to differentiate between types of post-secondary institutions, those that educate, and those that educate and innovate; and two, for a national strategy of innovation that put government, industry, and academia at the table together.  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 8  The World Bank‟s 2009 report on establishing world-class universities echoed Wells‟s comments in its call for a national innovation system that could translate research into society-ready products and services efficiently and competitively.  And in the forthright words of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, “We might be able to stimulate our way back to stability, but we can only invent our way back to prosperity. We need everyone at every level to get smarter.”  That‟s a lot of powerful voices in a lot of places calling for much the same thing. Let me tell you about the impetus UBC is providing in answer.  Thirty-seven percent of all research and development in British Columbia takes place in universities and almost entirely in the four research-intensive universities: UBC, Simon Fraser, UVic and UNBC. But fully seventy percent of university research takes place at UBC. That means UBC is responsible for over a quarter of all research in the province. Compare that with the University of California, where only seven percent of R&D in California takes place at all of the U of C campuses combined. BC is highly dependent on UBC as the leading conduit for the injection of innovation into the economy, and Canada as a whole is far more reliant on its universities than is the US. Canadian industry doesn‟t have the research power enjoyed by American firms, but Canadian universities do. Over $40 million in research activity at UBC is contracted, and directly funded, each year by private sector firms that are using UBC as their research arm.  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 9  UBC stands among the top 10 universities in North America in terms of the „patent pipeline,‟ a sophisticated measure of commercialization of research. At $13.6 million in 2007, UBC licensing revenue exceeded all other Canadian universities by a wide margin; Calgary was next at $4.9 million. BC‟s biotech cluster is made up of about 100 companies employing 2,600 people, and is the seventh largest in North America. It is primarily spun out of UBC. UBC currently ranks 23rd in science and engineering publications in North America, and with the highest publications growth rate of any university in North America, is fast climbing that list.  I said a few minutes ago that I want you to see UBC with new eyes. UBC as an impetus for innovation in partnership with BC business is one of the reasons why.  And what do I mean by a climate and geography of innovation? Well, certainly what I don’t mean is business as usual. And I‟m not alone in that. Just two weeks ago, a report by Nobel Prize-winning US economist Joseph Stiglitz led French president Nicolas Sarcozy to call for the implementation of a „joie de vivre‟ index! Diane Francis of the Financial Post says only slightly less dramatically, “The status quo is not an option …. Sustainable businesses, in enlightened nations, can be built and perpetuated only if they meet the needs of all the connected constituencies—employees, suppliers, the environment, society, investors, lenders, and governments.” I notice even the Vancouver Board of Trade has a Chief Happiness Officer, and just a few weeks ago I spotted Sauder  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 10  Business School‟s own Dan Muzyka quoting the Buddha in The Globe & Mail on the importance of giving back. What the heck is going on?  Economists are paying considerable attention to the effects of creativity, authenticity, well-being, and diversity on the long-term economic health of companies and countries. Moreover, economists such as Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen as well as UBC‟s own John Helliwell are redefining what we mean by long-term economic prosperity and how we measure it. Stiglitz says we must add measures of happiness, health, and well-being to our traditional consideration of GDP. Helliwell has proven the link between happiness, and productivity and profitability. Even more relevant for today is that Helliwell and others have demonstrated clear causal links between education and happiness.  Dave Mowat, CEO of ATB Financial and former CEO of Vancity Credit Union, has said, “You can draw a direct, straight-line relationship [from happy people] to the financial success of your company.” I‟m drawing another straight line: from UBC‟s core business to well-being and happiness, in our regional economy and beyond.  Economist Richard Florida shows a clear correlation between the presence of a talented “creative class,” the strength of a region‟s technology sector, and the region‟s overall economic success. He focuses on the ability to attract talent, saying, “Smart people are the most critical resource to any economy …. By attracting [the smartest people from around the world] and rapidly and widely disseminating the knowledge they create,  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 11  universities will have a much greater effect on the nation‟s economy as well as regional growth.”  So what‟s the secret to attracting talent? How do you keep people happy? Because I agree. Patents and licensing fees are all very well, but it‟s estimated that 73 percent of new knowledge generated by university research is transmitted into the economy through its graduates. Which means we need smart people here in BC who are happy to stay.  Helliwell says it‟s things like trust; strong networks with family, friends, and community; and freedom from discrimination. Florida flips this last around, saying that successful places are those that encourage diversity, “plug-and-play communities where anyone can fit in quickly …, find opportunity, build support structures, be themselves, and not get stuck in any one identity.” He adds that while a solid business climate will always be important, “having an effective people climate is even more essential.”  It‟s no coincidence that UBC‟s new strategic plan names an exceptional learning environment as its overarching goal, with sustainability, inter-cultural understanding, and an outstanding work environment among the key strategies aimed at achieving it. As the province‟s largest university and second-largest employer, UBC as a place helps define BC as a place for an enormous number of people. UBC‟s new brand, which you may have begun to see around the city, captures this idea of a geography of innovation in its tagline: a place of mind. We want to communicate here at home, throughout BC, and around the world, that UBC is a place where every student, staff and faculty member,  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 12  alumnus, and community member can learn, discover, and contribute in his or her own way. In class, in the community, online, or from wherever you may be in the world. Even … from here.  [VIDEO—110 seconds]  I said I wanted you to see UBC with new eyes. UBC as a place of mind is the second reason why.  Impetus for innovation. Geography of innovation, or a place of mind. And last but not least, innovation inputs. On this, I‟d like to share some stories with you.  Story #1: Pulp Non-Fiction BC‟s 78 mechanical pulp refiners consume 11 percent of the total energy produced in the province. An interdisciplinary team of seven UBC researchers along with a consortium of companies that includes BC Hydro and Catalyst Paper launched a $2 million, five-year energy efficiency program to develop technologies aimed at improving production and paper quality while reducing energy consumption. Projected annual savings are $45 million, or a thousand gigawatt hours, enough to power 100,000 homes for a year.  Story #2: Drugs Without Borders On the inspiration of a wonderful UBC student who has gone on to become a Rhodes Scholar, UBC‟s University-Industry Liaison Office has developed a Global Access  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 13  Policy that makes UBC-patented discoveries, including medicines, more accessible in developing countries. In one example, local company iCo Therapeutics Inc. has partnered with the University to advance a new, non-toxic formulation for the treatment of leishmaniasis. In the developing world, this infection attacks two million cancer and AIDS patients a year, and the old drug is difficult to access and highly toxic. UBC‟s commercialization agreement with iCo ensures that the new formula will make its way in the world to where it is needed most, at an affordable cost.  Story #3: 612 Main Not far from here, at the corner of Main and Keefer Streets, UBC‟s Learning Exchange storefront offers basic and advanced computer skills classes to residents of the downtown eastside. The program is sponsored by HSBC Bank Canada, as is the ESL Conversation Program, where many of those same residents in turn become volunteer instructors helping new immigrants acquire the skills they need to find work and build a life in BC.  ***  Innovation inputs are those that change the underlying nature of the economy from the moment of discovery forward. They‟re the currency of the knowledge economy, and they‟re core business for the research-intensive university. Innovation is what UBC and its sister research-intensive universities do. And by all accounts, innovation is what our economy needs most.  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 14  I want you to see UBC with new eyes. UBC‟s innovation inputs, which can change the way we do business—and medicine and art and forestry—is the third reason why.  As my time with you draws to a close, I can‟t help playing the university professor for just a moment, and introducing some Latin: Cogito ergo sum. That‟s René Descartes‟s famous phrase, “I think, therefore I am.” I like to think that if Descartes were here today, perhaps teaching philosophy at UBC and reflecting on the current state of the economy, he might say instead: Cogito ergo ago. “I think, therefore … I drive.”  I would like to acknowledge Walter Sudmant, Director of Planning and Institutional Research and author of UBC‟s 2009 economic impact study, which is available in brief on your tables and in full online; and also Scott Macrae, UBC‟s Director of Public Affairs, and his team, for UBC‟s new brand and the tagline that sums it up: a place of mind.  Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all those who think for a living, an acknowledgement that we all think for a living, or we wouldn‟t have made it through this past year—it‟s very good to see you again. And finally, my gratitude for your hospitality. Thank you.  -30-  Vancouver Board of Trade – Thinking and Driving – September 25, 2009 v.2  Page 15  References  BC Stats, accessed at http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/bus_stat/bcea/BCEAchnd.asp September 11, 2009.

1.0107471~National core for neuroethics, September 11, 2008~Toope, Stephen J.~National Core for Neuroethics     National Core for Neuroethics September 11, 2008 Chan Centre for the Performing Arts  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia     2008  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure today to add my voice in welcome and in celebration of this inauguration.  It is always exciting to open a facility such as this. It is enormously flattering to UBC when the quality of our scholarship is recognized in this way and we are deeply grateful to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and to other supporters, including the National Institute of Mental Health, the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research and our partners at Vancouver’s teaching hospitals and in the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute.  In reflection of my role as an advocate for this great university, this has also been an opportunity for us at UBC to register our accomplishments in neuroscience to date and to demonstrate our ability to provide global leadership in neuroethics. With credit, again, to CIHR, no country in the  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     world has invested as much or as directly in the development of neuroethics. And this investment has given us at UBC the ability to build strength on strength. It has also allowed us to attract scholars, researchers and leaders of the quality of July Illes, a Professor of Neurology, a Canada Research Chair and the Director of this National Core. Vancouverites, British Columbians and all Canadians have reason to be proud of this institution.  But we’d be missing the point today if we chose only to celebrate UBC’s accomplishment or its advancing good fortune. Today, we embrace a new challenge. We wade into the very seat of social, cultural and physical understanding – the human brain – and we contemplate the ramifications of meddling with that most precious organ.  Of course, “meddling” is a loaded word, but as the ethicists among you will attest, every word comes with its own baggage, with suppositions  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     and preconceptions. And I think it is important – or at least highly relevant – to acknowledge how charged the public conversation could become if we were to pursue advances in neuroscience without considering the social, cultural, personal and, indeed, the religious implications.  We have had lessons in this before. In Canada, for example, our abilities to perform what were once considered miracles in reproductive health quickly outstripped any social or national consensus about whether those new skills were positive or even acceptable. In 1989, the UBC medical geneticist Patricia Baird wound up leading a Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies that was charged with coming to grips with those issues.  Today. Dr. Baird makes a couple of points that should, perhaps, seem obvious. First, it is dangerous for science to get ahead of society. It is  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     incredibly difficult to create appropriate policies or to ensure scientific accountability if the public is not aware of the issues. People need to be engaged in a thoughtful and broadly based discussion about the advantages – and potential downsides – of scientific advances.  The process of engaging the public can be complex and painfully slow – and the complexity increases, and the pace slows further – if government is asked to take the lead. For example, it takes an average of seven years to implement the recommendations of a Royal Commission, and it’s quite common for Commission reports to sit on the shelf for 15 to 20 years before government finds a way to render collected wisdom into workable policy.  In the case of the Baird Commission, it was 2004, 15 years later, before the first resulting legislation passed through Parliament, and two more  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     years before the government finally created the Assisted Human Reproduction Agency of Canada.  If governments feel that science has run ahead of society – if politicians or public groups get a sense that scientists are pursuing vested interest more enthusiastically than the public good – the result is often government intervention that is restrictive, regulatory and potentially punitive. In the United States, for example, you currently have a situation in which stem cell researchers can face fines or imprisonment in some jurisdictions.  If governments are imperfect vehicles for advancing complex social conversation – and they are – I would have to argue that universities are the best alternative. University researchers are not immune to the temptations of power, privilege or personal financial gain, but contrary to some of the alternative venues, those are not OUR main objectives.  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     Our institutions are open and accountable, transparent and closely monitored – from within and without. As the optimal locus for a robust dialogue, we are best positioned to bring together scientists, ethicists, representatives from government and business and, most importantly, the public at large.  In a best case – in this case – we can do that proactively. The National Core for Neuroethics is embedded – (another loaded word; perhaps I should say, fully integrated) – in the UBC Brain Research Centre. We have the ability to keep pace with the issues, to ensure the highest level of professional self-regulation. And at the same time, we offer the promise of leading a global conversation about neuroethics – one that I hope could ultimately result in a set of ethical findings that would be as broadly applicable as possible.  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     As a specialist in international law, I have a penchant for trying to create global norms. I think these are particularly desirable in the area of human rights: it is becoming increasingly important that states work together to establish the moral and legal foundation for a body of international law capable of protecting people against threats to their rights by corrupt, weak or indifferent regimes.  If the spirit of internationalism is to have any real meaning, countries must learn to build on shared understandings of what is right and acceptable, the value of public education, the importance of free speech in a free society, and so on.  If anything, achieving global norms in neuroethics may be more difficult yet. I have already mentioned that I believe neuroethics should be subject to cultural and religious considerations. I don’t believe that there is a purely secular standard available to us. In fact, I think it would be  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     wrong to privilege a certain view – whether it is religious or specifically non-religious. If we hope to fairly represent the views of all constituents – of all the stakeholders locally and globally – we have to be open to approaches to ethics that are secular AND religious.  I am influenced in this by the work of the McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, who last year won the Templeton Prize for his efforts to reconcile the spiritual and the scientific.  In the face of yet more highly loaded words, Taylor objected to what we have come to know as the “rational” movement, which began during the “Enlightenment,” in which it was argued that morality and spirituality are quaint anachronisms in the age of reason. Taylor said that this narrow, reductive approach denies the full account of how and why humans strive for meaning. And that, in turn, makes it impossible to solve the world’s most intractable problems.  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     At the same time, Taylor also chastised those who use moral certitude or religious beliefs in the name of battling injustice. That, he cautioned, can lead to a situation in which people say, “Our cause is good, so we can inflict righteous violence.”  Again, we cannot ignore any of our social, cultural, religious or historical contexts if we hope that our ethical investigations will be complete and our findings robust.  I have one last challenge today for those of you who will wrestle with these sometimes intractable issues: be modest. Pride is a hazard in most pursuits, and in ethics, there is a risk that the most accomplished practitioners will stop listening to the unschooled. There is a risk that we might start thinking that others don’t agree with us because they have  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     not given serious consideration to all the issues or because they have not asked hard enough questions.  When someone disagrees with you, it pays to begin by asking yourself whether YOU have asked hard enough questions. And in a field in which cultural context is central, it would be rash to dismiss too quickly cultural representatives whose views are “typical,” even if you find them ill-informed.  I recognize that I am asking for the impossible: I am searching for global norms even as I dismiss the easy routes to certainty. I ask for leadership – which is necessarily bold and decisive – but then I insist you model humility.  Well, I won’t apologize. We are in the business of breaking down intellectual barriers that once seemed insurmountable. In that pursuit, on  National Core for Neuroethics     2008     this occasion – in this new National Core for Neuroethics – I couldn’t be more optimistic about the prospects for success.  Thank you and good luck.  
1.0107486~Dawson College graduation address, June 2007~Toope, Stephen J.~DAWSON COLLEGE GRADUATION ADDRESS:  JUNE 2007  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Mr Director General, Distinguished Guests, Colleagues, Parents and Families and Friends of the graduates, Members of the Dawson College Class of 2007.  When Richard Filion asked me to speak at the Dawson College Graduation this year, I did not hesitate for a moment in accepting the invitation. I could not imagine a greater honour than to be with you at graduation in this terrible and remarkable year. Hovering around us tonight is the knowledge that in this year Dawson College became an international symbol of violence and fear. But I know, and you know, that Dawson is so much more than that – so much better than that. And I want to talk tonight about your growth as a class and as a community, your confrontation with hate and hopelessness.  It was Albert Camus who wrote that “an atmosphere of terror hardly encourages reflection.”i That is the atmosphere that was created on the 13th of September 2006 at Dawson College. It is an 2  atmosphere antithetical to places of learning, for schools and colleges and universities ought to be places where reflection is prized above all – critical reflection upon ourselves, our world and our places in the world. “Reflection” is not the self-pitying diatribe of a misfit who posts his hurt and anger online; nor is it sitting at the back of a class and writing violent stories to shock and perhaps to scream for help, as did the Virginia Tech killer. No, reflection is a result of interaction with other human beings engaged in their own exploration; learning, thinking and applying our learning to our own situation in life.  But in our world there have always been destructive people who are closed off from healthy self-reflection, who use violence to attack the intellectual, spiritual and artistic growth of others. On the 1st of May, 1945 Major-General Georges P. Vanier, then serving as Canadian Ambassador to France, broadcast on CBC Radio, reporting on his visit to the Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald. In reading the transcript of that broadcast, one of 3  Vanier’s images caught me up short. Vanier described “a famous oak tree at Buchenwald beneath which Goethe wrote some of his poems. The German gaolers found nothing better than to make of the tree a gibbet for hanging men by the armpits with their hands tied behind their backs.”ii No image could better capture the choices that we face, as individuals and as societies. We can learn, we can create, we can flourish. We can stagnate, we can destroy, we can die violently.  Your presence here tonight is an affirmation that you have chosen to transcend violence, to defeat hate. Why have you made that choice? As Vanier reminds us, it is not inevitable. Knowing that one of the greatest poets in any language had been inspired by a beautiful tree at Buchenwald did not preclude a later generation from turning that very tree into a symbol of the worst of the human cruelty.  4  I hope that you are here tonight because somewhere in your academic career you have been inspired. Someone has excited you – a teacher or a fellow student. Something you have read has fired your imagination. Something said in a class has given you an idea about the future. You know that the world, as hard as it can be, is also filled with promise. I think that you share the moral universe of the wonderful Nigerian novelist and poet, Ben Okri, who writes: We are the miracles that God made To taste the bitter fruit of Time. We are precious. And one day our suffering Will turn into the wonders of the earth.  I only began to learn that lesson fully in my thirties. Until then, my life had been relatively uneventful, and I had been encouraged to believe in a beneficent universe. I had been raised in a loving family. I had been blessed with incredible educational opportunities. I had a great job as Dean of Law at McGill, a wonderful wife, a lovely little daughter, and a son who had just arrived. Then one day, during a meeting, I was given an urgent  5  phone message. I could never have imagined the consequences: I learned later that night that my parents had been brutally murdered in their quiet Beaconsfield home.  Within a couple of days the perpetrators had been caught; three teen-aged boys, who had no real motive, who had killed for fun. The senselessness of the attack was devastating. I imagine that for those of you who lived through the shootings at Dawson, and especially for the family of Anastasia De Sousa, that same shocking and grotesque purposelessness must have caused deep heartache.  How does one react to senseless violence that rips at the core of our world? There is no single answer. People must be allowed to react in their own ways. I can only tell you how I reacted – and the reaction was almost immediate. I said no. No, you pathetic boys are not going to destroy the memory of my parents, who lived rich and gentle lives. No, you are not going to define my existence or 6  that of my family. No, you will not turn me into a fearful person. No, you will not teach me to hate.  In his majestic novel, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy authors one of the most evocative and frightening lines in all of English literature. He foretells the inevitability of suffering: “Once victim, always victim.” I stand here today to refute Hardy, to proclaim that victimization is as much an attitude as a condition, and to argue that it is possible to confront and address the effects of violence in our own lives. Dealing with the effects of violence is nevertheless painful, for individuals, for cities and for societies – it does not allow escape, only confrontation; not triumph, only modest gains. But to be a victim of violence is not to lose control over one’s destiny. Our reactions are not programmed, not inevitable.  Here at Dawson, I know that many of you have made similar discoveries. Out of violence and fear, you created art. Alice in 7  Oblivion, a multimedia tour de force, was one way to look forward. In instructor Will Aitkin’s words: “This has been a remarkable group of students. They have taken this material and transformed it into something incredible. I am so impressed – there is nothing sentimental or simplistic about Alice in Oblivion. It’s an honest, intelligent reflection of what these students have been feeling.” Out of violence and fear, you created political action. You went to Quebec City and to Ottawa, as part of a well coordinated campaign, to demand the strengthening of Canada’s gun control legislation and practices. Already you have succeeded in promoting “Anastasia’s Law” to strengthen the controls over guns in this province. Out of violence and fear, you just went on with your lives, reading poems, solving equations, playing sports. You took to heart the Reverend Sokolowski’s words at Anastasia De Sousa’s funeral: “The book of her life was closed so suddenly; it was such a short life. But the books of our life are still open, so we all have a chance to do something with our life, to change our life, to do something really good.” 8  So, you are the strong class of 2007. At every graduation, students and their families can look back at hardships overcome, at difficult tasks accomplished, at successes that might not have seemed possible. But this graduation is unique. You are the class that transcended violence and fear. You are the class that fought back simply by getting on with your lives. You are the class that valued learning more than anger, friendship more than enmity, and a future you can shape more than a past you can’t erase.  Every class has teachers to thank, friends to thank, parents and families to thank. I guess that your thanks are even more profound. But I want to tell you that for this very special class, the thanks are also reversed. This city thanks you. This province thanks you. And, coming from far-away British Columbia, I can tell you that the country thanks you. We thank you for your courage and for your fortitude. In displaying that fortitude, you have created a new and powerful symbol. Dawson is much more 9  than a place where crazed violence stole innocent life. Dawson is a place where students, staff, faculty and families stood up and said: “We are part of a great tradition of learning and reflection. We are the tree under which Goethe wrote. We are the miracles that God made to taste the bitter fruit of time.”  I am so honoured to be with you tonight. Congratulations to every graduate. Congratulations to all your friends and families. Congratulations to the Dawson staff. Congratulations to this strong Dawson community. Thank you. i  A.

1.0107488~2008 Spring Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2008 Spring Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  21 May to 6 June 2008 I  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2008.  Today, I hope that you graduates are feeling a sense of freedom. Lab assignments, exams, performances, and papers are over, and you have successfully navigated the bureaucracy of a big university – no mean feat. Believe me, I know. You have reached the big day. Congratulations!  But your liberation today is far deeper than simply marking the end of a degree programme – your liberation today is of a kind that can help you through the rest of your life. That’s what I would like to address for the next few minutes: education as a source of freedom.  Just a few weeks ago I was reading a story in the Globe and Mail about the thousands of families displaced by post-election violence in Kenya. Stephanie Nolan, in my view one of the finest journalists that our country has ever produced, was interviewing some little children. One seven- or eight-year-old boy was asked what he hoped for, now that the politicians had managed to find a way out of their impasse. 2  He answered: “I just want to go to school”. Perhaps it was only my mood that day, but that brief statement struck me like a physical blow. How simple. How profound.  I was thrown back to another day some ten years earlier. I was myself in Kenya, in the town of Kisumu, visiting a friend with whom I had worked on the board of a Canadian development agency. This fellow, Lucas Wadenya, was an inspiration for me. He was so smart, so committed, so articulate, and he had resisted all temptations to join the ranks of international development bureaucrats in Geneva or elsewhere. He was passionate about working close to his own community. I was visiting Lucas for the first time in his home, a simple cinder block structure with three rooms, I seem to remember – but a real cut above the mud huts of most people in the rural areas outside Kisumu.  The moment of blinding insight for me came not from Lucas, but from his young son. I wish I could remember his name. As Lucas, his wife and I chatted, the little boy was playing happily in the dust with a coat hanger bent into the shape of a bicycle. I had seen the boy’s room 3  on a tour of the house; there weren’t any other toys that I could see. “So”, I thought, “you really can be happy with very few things.”  Don’t get me wrong, you should never romanticize poverty. This boy wasn’t happy because his parents had few material goods. He was happy, I suspect, because he had a stable existence, with a family, and he may even have sensed that he had prospects for education and change in his own circumstances over the years. He had hope. By local standards he was well-off; by ours he had almost nothing.  Which brings me back to the little boy quoted in the Globe and Mail: “I just want to go to school”. For him, school probably represented his home village, from which he had been displaced, and a return to stability; an existence much like that of Lucas’s son. But I want to assert that school also just meant school, and he really wanted to go. Why?  I think it is because we know, instinctively almost, that school, an education, represents choices and hope. It means freedom. Now, I know that when you are stuck in the middle of mid-term assignments 4  and exams, an education can feel anything but liberating; it can seem a grind. But I hope that already, only a few days or weeks after the end of your degree, you are beginning to sense the freedom that a university education provides.  When I talk to our UBC alumni, which I do all the time and all around the world, so many tell me that they realize that university changed the world for them. It certainly did for me. My education transformed my expectations in life; it opened up opportunities that I could never have imagined as a kid. I have been able to work with people from around the globe, and to contribute to society in many countries. I have been invited to fight for causes that I believe in deeply. I have continued to be challenged and to learn. Many of you will share those experiences, I know, thanks to your education.  My only advice is: allow yourself to be freed. Your education is one of the few gifts in life that doesn’t atrophy or get consumed. It is a base from which you can keep exploring and building. When Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank and Nobel Laureate, was here at UBC earlier this spring to receive an honorary 5  degree in a special ceremony to help mark our 100th anniversary, he issued a challenge to students. He said, “you have choices about where you spend your energy and your talents. You can choose to contribute positively to the world.”  Of course, the freedom of an education is no guarantee that any of us will make good choices; all it can do is accord us the possibility of making a positive contribution. In his brilliant novel, The Cellist of Sarajevo, just published, UBC creative writing instructor, Steven Galloway, imagines how a small group of people in Sarajevo find ways to make their daily lives humane amidst the terrible siege of their city.  The real siege stretched over almost four years from April 1992 to February 1996. In Galloway’s imagined siege, one character is a crack sniper shooting back at the people in the hills who hold the Sarajevans hostage. She becomes an accomplished killer. The sniper distances herself from her real personality by refusing to acknowledge her real name, calling herself only by the nom de guerre, Arrow. However, at one crucial moment she makes the 6  decision to escape from hate and violence, and she reclaims her real self and her real name. The moment is intensely dramatic. Not all of us will be confronted with such life and death challenges, but each one of us will have to make decisions about how to treat other people and how to live our lives with integrity. Our education should be a resource to help us make those decisions wisely because we have all been encouraged to think critically, to seek out personal insights, to ask ourselves who we really are.  Some of you may be feeling less than free today for a reason that we hate to talk about at congregation: student debt. I believe that Canadian public policy has focused too heavily on loans and not nearly enough on grants and bursaries in helping students to pay for higher education. Many people are advocating for change in that balance. But the reality is that too many Canadian students are graduating today with a sense that they don’t have choices. When I graduated, my own debts were a worry, but they were manageable, because I had been lucky enough to win generous scholarships. But my three college room-mates graduated with scary debts, and it did shape their immediate life choices. But even here, let me reassure 7  you, the liberation of education can play out. Even if you find yourself having to choose particular work largely to pay off debts, you do not need to be trapped. My three room-mates paid their debts, and then they used the flexible skills and the critical capacities of their education to work for most of their careers in their chosen fields of public service. Freedom is not necessarily a linear projection from today into the future, but you need never give up on the promise of freedom that a university education bequeaths to each and every one of us.  Education does give us choices. A university education gives us more choices. As you explore the choices in your own lives, and learn to build on the opportunities afforded to you here, I ask that you think about how our society can give more choices to others. Only 5% of aboriginal students graduating from high school in BC go on directly to university, versus 17% of all BC students. The situation for aboriginal students is actually much worse when one considers their much lower rate of high school graduation. Around the world, even fewer numbers of young people like you – with similar dreams and  8  hopes – experience higher education. In Kenya, by no means one of the poorest countries in Africa, the rate of participation is 4%.  So today, exalt in your freedom. Some of you have finished with exams forever. But please think about the greater freedom that your hard work has achieved, the liberation of choices in life, the freedom of hope. Think too about how to extend those choices to more and more of the inhabitants of our planet. Remember that little Kenyan boy: “I just want to go to school”.  Good luck to each and every member of this wonderful graduating class.  9  
1.0107499~2010 Spring Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2010 Spring Congregation  UBC Vancouver and Okanagan Campuses  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  26 May to 11 June 2010  1  Madam Chancellor, distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2010.  Strive: to make great efforts to do one’s best; to try very hard … To compete; to vie. (Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, 2d ed, 1983).  Well graduates, I am sure that over your time at UBC, you have all striven mightily – or you would not be here today. So my first words must be of congratulation. I am thrilled that you are now joining the alumni of UBC, a powerful force, some 250,000 strong. Parents, grandparents, siblings and friends, let’s give our graduates a well-deserved round of applause!  But graduates, I bring you some chastening news: the striving has only just begun. I bring that news most recently from India, from whence I returned only a couple of weeks ago, on my fourth trip since becoming President of UBC.  2  Here’s what I mean: everywhere you look in the major cities of India you will see ads for tutors, for preparatory colleges, for exam cramming books. As you drive across the countryside of rural India, you will see hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of tiny business colleges, and engineering schools on the outskirts of towns. They may not yet be very good, but they represent desire; the desire of millions upon millions of young Indians for education. Those Indians are striving, striving against remarkable odds, striving in ways that most of us in this privileged land of Canada can hardly imagine. Every time I go to India (and I could say the same about China, or Vietnam, or Kenya), I am humbled by the desire to succeed, the striving, that I see.  In UBC’s new strategic plan, Place and Promise, we commit ourselves to foster even greater international engagement, arguing that “[g]reat universities are bridges between communities and continents, hubs of intellectual and cultural interchange.” In parallel, UBC declares that it must do more to promote intercultural understanding, because “[w]e are one humanity and each deeply different. We may find no better place in which to embrace this paradox than the university.”  3  These are not platitudes, my friends. They are not simply feel-good statements about how nice it would be to promote good will amongst all peoples. My travels across the globe, my work in international human rights, tell me that international engagement and intercultural understanding are imperatives. If we do not embrace the opportunities presented to us to transcend our borders and to better understand our fellow human beings, we will quite simply, be left behind. Left behind in a world that is striving harder than are we. That’s the chastening news for you graduates, for all of us in this most beautiful part of a beautiful land.  Don’t get me wrong. I don’t romanticize the “rising east”. India, and China for that matter, faces problems that are daunting in scope and scale. I just met with the Indian Minister of Human Resources in Delhi, and he told me that he believed that to continue with its economic expansion, India would have to create some 800 new universities in the next decade or so, each with roughly 60,000 students. That is 800 new UBCs with 4,800,000 new student spaces. India will strive to do this while at the same time having to deal with persistent drought, environmental degradation, ethnic tension, various forms of terrorism, and a sclerotic bureaucracy. But we in Canada  4  need to understand that the ambition of India is breathtaking, and that the striving, the competitiveness, is insistent.  This ambition and competitiveness hit me like a ton of bricks as I experienced again the drama of Indian roads. On my last trip, I had a driver who took me across the Rajasthani countryside. He was brilliant, navigating between vehicles with only millimeters to spare at roughly 100 kilometers an hour, finding tiny country roads when the highway was closed, evading gigantic potholes and cows ambling down laneways. He was actually pretty safe, but he was unbelievably motivated to show that he was faster and more nimble than every other driver on the road. I thought to myself: “no wonder there are so many Indian scientists, engineers, software designers scattered across the globe. In this culture, you have to strive so hard to make good. And the reflexes are amazing. I am sure that between China and India the electronic gaming industry will soon be utterly captured. Good luck Canada!  The stakes are not only economic. At UBC, our vision statement highlights our commitment to fostering global citizenship and advancing a civil and sustainable society. These commitments are part of the wider values that 5  have long animated Canadian society, albeit imperfectly. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects basic liberties such as the freedoms of speech, association and assembly, but it also guarantees equality and non-discrimination on grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. Court interpretation has added non-discrimination protections for sexual minorities as well. Many people choose to immigrate to Canada, including many of you in this room, not only to pursue economic opportunity, but to live in a society marked by inclusion and civility.  In a world of increasing mobility, contested values, and strong challenges to Western philosophical traditions, the striving of various peoples and cultures will have powerful political and social implications as you graduates make your lives and careers. The challenges that you will face are not only in competition for exciting jobs, they are in competition over social and personal values as well, and over cultural influence. For those of you who already live out the bridging of cultures in your own lives, for first or second generation Canadians, consider your selves fortunate. You may already have developed tools that we will all need to live in a world of growing international and intercultural mixing. 6  So my message, though rooted in recognition of the increasing complexity of our own societies, is actually pretty simple. On this marvelous day, the day that marks your own great achievement as a newly minted graduate, please try to avoid that great Canadian disease: complacency. Bono once said that “the world needs more Canada”. While that may be true, I don’t think the world knows it. If we don’t invest in our own future by increasing our educational standards, by improving our capacity to create innovative solutions to fundamental problems, by enhancing our productivity, Canada will become a lovely backwater.  The world out there is filled with millions upon millions of people who want their life and the lives of their children to be better than the lives of their parents. They are educating themselves to make that happen. They are working very hard. So, I hope that you graduates will strive to protect and promote the values that you hold dear. Strive to better understand the people of diverse backgrounds sitting right around you. Strive to integrate the gifts that international experiences can bring to your life. Strive always to do your best. Congratulations, and good luck.  7  
1.0107475~2008 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2008 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  19-21 November 2008 I  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2008.  It is a great delight for me to welcome our newly minted Chancellor. Not only does it mean that I get to sit in a more comfortable, if less impressive, chair, than I did last spring but I also benefit directly from her wisdom and experience, and from the warmth of her personality. Welcome, Sarah Morgan Sylvester.  As you graduates cross the stage later in the ceremony, you will have your moment in the limelight, but according to the traditions of our university, traditions inherited from almost a thousand years of practice in Europe, you are not really graduates of UBC until after the new Chancellor pronounces three words: “I admit you”.  For the majority of degree candidates, the phrase “I admit you” is said at the end of the ceremony, and covers the entire class. For doctoral candidates, that phrase is said individually as each person crosses the stage. I must acknowledge that many of those doctoral candidates are confused by the words; they find them rather funny, 2  and they often smile or even laugh as the Chancellor looks at them and says “I admit you”. I can imagine what they are thinking, what you may be thinking only minutes from now: Why am I being “admitted” to something? What am I being admitted to? Why is this smiling person in a gold-braided bat-cape saying this to me?  So for a few moments, I want to explore what it means to be “admitted” as a graduate of UBC, one of a select group of globally influential universities in the world today.  I want to dispute one potential notion right at the beginning: you are not being admitted into some secret elite society, with a free throw into success, wealth and happiness. I am not going to stand up here making one of those speeches about how special you are, how you have been chosen.  In fact, my guess is that you are being admitted into more hard work, more struggles and some disappointments. But I hope that you are being admitted into a group that has gained resources and resilience here at UBC to handle what life throws at each one of you. I also 3  hope that the friendships that you have formed here at UBC will be a source of strength throughout your lives and where-ever you may find yourselves. I still count my university friends as some of my closest; many of you will too. But I encourage you to work at those friendships; don’t take them for granted. As you begin new programmes of study or working lives, and as you get busier and busier with families and new friends, take the time to keep in touch with your friends made here at UBC. That network can help sustain you in good times and in bad.  When the Chancellor admits you, then, the admission is to a new stage in your existence, but it is also a promise: a promise that if you make some effort, your UBC roots will continue to spread. The things that you learned here should continue to inform your analysis and your emotions; the people you met here should continue to resonate in memory, and some of them in your daily life.  I still draw on the practice of my own PhD supervisor who was one of the most reliable people I have ever met. When I was trying to finish my PhD dissertation so that I would not have to register for another 4  term and pay huge international student fees at Cambridge University, I sent in what I hoped would be the final draft of my last chapter. I then discovered that my supervisor, a very distinguished international lawyer, Sir Derek Bowett, was actually away from England conducting a commercial arbitration in Dubai. My heart sank; I figured I would have to write that cheque for thousands of pounds that I didn’t have just as my scholarship was coming to an end.  Much to my surprise and delight, five days later I received my final chapter back by courier, with lots of helpful comments and agreement that I could submit my dissertation. That showed organization, as well as remarkable diligence and commitment to students. I try to live up to that model, and I can tell you that it sure made me feel warmly about my university. I hope that most of you will remember an experience where someone here at UBC went the extra distance for you. If not, if you made real efforts that seemed to go unnoticed, that is our failing, not yours.  5  Today you are being admitted to an alumni body of more than 250,000 graduates spread around the globe. I meet proud and active UBC alums in Shanghai, in Mumbai and in New Westminster. I hope that you will stay connected with your university because you have memories that matter to you, because you have made friends with your talented classmates who have altered the course of your life, because you have learned and been challenged to think critically and creatively.  Above all, I hope that you will stay connected because of the difference you have made here and the difference you will make to the world outside these doors. Like your parents and family and friends, we are proud of you and we want to know what you are up to.  More than twenty-five years ago, the brilliant Anglo-Indian novelist Salman Rushdie published Midnight’s Children. It won England’s prestigious Man Booker Prize, and later a second Booker of Bookers: the prize for the very best novel in the last quarter century. Midnight’s Children is an allegory that follows the imagined life of the first person born after the stroke of midnight on the day of India’s independence, 6  the 15th of August, 1947. That character, Saleem Sinai, is magically connected to all the other children born in that first hour of independence, and his life mirrors all the hopes, struggles, violence, and beauty of the sub-continent as it weathered the partition of India and Pakistan, inter-communal strife and states of emergency.  Above all, the book is an exploration of identity, of what it is to be human. Near the end of the book, Saleem makes the following declaration:  Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-theworld affected was affected by mine. I am everything that happens after I’ve gone that would not have happened if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each “I”, every one…of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you’ll have to swallow a world. -Salmon Rushdie, Midnight’s Children (Toronto: Vintage Canada, 2006, at 440-41.  7  I hope that your time at UBC has helped you to swallow a world, a world of hard work, of discovery, of ideas, of heart, of frustration, of anger, of hope, of love.  The wider world is waiting for you; it is ready to swallow you whole, to give you the opportunity to thrive in friendships, in families, in play, in service, in work. But you have to pay attention, to make choices and to use the tools that you have gained through your education. I urge you to see how you can respond to, shape and change our world. You can become everything that happens after you’ve gone that would not have happened if you had not come. What a gift.  What is it to which the Chancellor admits you today? Well, nothing less than life, in all its complexity and richness. I wish every one of you health, happiness and deep fulfillment. Thank you.  8  
1.0102603~Pluralism and pragmatism : the role of universities in developing human potential~Toope, Stephen J.~PLURALISM AND PRAGMATISM: THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES IN DEVELOPING HUMAN POTENTIAL Inaugural Keynote Address in the Ismai’li Lecture Series Ismai’li Centre Burnaby, Tuesday, January 31, 2012  I Introduction Thank you, President Manji, 1 for your warm welcome, and Ms. Chandani,2 for your thoughtful introduction. I would like to acknowledge President Mohamed Manji of the Ismai’li Council for Canada and President Samira Alibhai of the Ismai’li Council for British Columbia for this wonderful opportunity; the Honourable Naomi Yamamoto, Minister of Advanced Education; and the Honourable Harry Bloy, Minister of State for your presence today; Community leaders, colleagues and friends. I am both privileged and deeply honoured to deliver the inaugural address in the Ismai’li Lecture Series. UBC’s relationship with the Ismai’li community dates back many years, and our connections speak to our shared values, shared concerns, and complementary strengths. Khalil Shariff, CEO of the Aga Khan Foundation of Canada, is a graduate of UBC. Firoz Rasul, a former member of UBC’s Board of Governors, is 1 2  President Mohamad Manji has flown in from Toronto to attend the inaugural lecture. Ms. Shala Chandani is the MC for this event.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 2  President of Aga Khan University, and his wife Saida is working with UBC professors to establish a global health program in Kenya. Shamez Mohamed, who is responsible for building the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto and the Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa, sits on UBC’s Museum of Anthropology External Advisory Board. The Aga Khan Development Network works closely with UBC’s Human Early Learning Partnership, and UBC’s former head of paediatrics, Dr. Robert Armstrong, recently became the founding Dean of AKU’s Medical College in East Africa. On behalf of UBC, I’m so grateful for the strength of our friendship, and for today’s honour. I have been asked to address the question of the role of universities in developing human potential. The topic is of almost limitless scope. Yet I realized that if I did nothing more today than describe to you the reciprocal sharing of knowledge, research, and personnel between our two communities; joint development work and program delivery; immeasurable generosity—with money, expertise, and ideas—across cultures, across borders, side by side, day after day over years, I would in large measure have answered the question. But … I am a professor, used to 50-minute lecture slots, so I will say a bit more!  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 3  Pluralism and pragmatism are the twin lenses I’ve chosen to focus on the question of the role of universities in developing human potential. His Highness the Aga Khan has been tireless in recent years in promoting the cause of pluralism, in speeches and in his most recent book. 3 He has inspired audiences of all ages, races, and cultures to discuss and debate it, and to develop their capacity for it. He is just as passionately articulate about the need for action. He is a pragmatist for whom faith is not simply a set of beliefs but a way of living one’s life, and the community he leads lives out this idea not just among themselves but within the wider societies of which they are citizens, all around the world. The spiritual tradition in which I was raised agrees that faith without works is dead. 4 And the secular institution I serve avows that the teaching, learning, and research that occurs under our auspices is done in service to the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world. 5 II The Convert So I will speak today about pluralism and pragmatism within the context of the role of the university. But first: what is that role? Instead of an answer, I give you a story. In it, a UBC alumna looks back on her first year at UBC. Here is her story: 3  Where Hope Takes Root: Democracy and Pluralism in an Interdependent World James 2:14-26 5 Place and Promise: The UBC Plan, http://strategicplan.ubc.ca/the-plan/vision-statement/ 4  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 4  I was a white, middle-class Catholic girl—first communion at six, confirmed at 12, and convinced I was to become a missionary by the time I was 18. I’d heard about millions of people who worshipped false gods and who would never get to heaven unless they converted, and I couldn’t see the point of four more years of school when my powers of persuasion were clearly needed elsewhere! My mom listened to my plans without comment, but then secretly called and talked to my history teacher, a man I greatly respected, and he took me aside one day after class and convinced me that a little more education might make me that much more capable of saving the world. I discovered UBC had a religious studies department, which intrigued me, so I registered there and signed up for their 100-level survey course of world religions. I figured maybe it would give me more insight into the people I’d be meeting so that it would be easier to convert them. That first September day, in a packed lecture hall, a Dr. Charles Anderson took the podium. He was tall and thin, with a kind, intelligent face, and a slight southern-American accent, and he began to speak about Hinduism. What struck me was that he didn’t speak about it from within the context of Christianity, nor did he compare it to Christianity. He didn’t compare it to anything, for that matter. He spoke about its origins and history, literature, central tenets and practitioners as  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 5  belonging to a complex and ancient tradition, sufficient unto itself. In that hour, although I didn’t yet realize it, something I had thought was solid in me, something I’d built my sense of reality and identity on, started to give way. I didn’t sleep that night. After Hinduism, Dr. Anderson spoke about Buddhism, and more of my formerly solid self gave way. Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam. I listened, and what I heard I recognized as true. I read, and what I read gave evidence of being sacred. In that year, much of what had been assembled in me in the previous 18 broke apart. I came close to quitting university because of how difficult that process was. But in the end, I chose to major in Religious Studies. I have spent all of the years since then reassembling myself, choosing deliberately the pieces I’m willing to call ‘me,’ and always leaving room for ideas and experiences still to come. I traveled after I graduated, and attended a Catholic mass at the Vatican. The service and singing and prayers were in Italian, but I understood it all, and I understood that in some sense, this would always be a part of me. Two weeks later, in Izmir, Turkey, I awoke to the Muslim call to prayer. As I listened, I realized that I understood that, too, and that it, too, was now a part of me:  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 6  “…Come to prayer, Come to success, The time for the best of deeds has come …” “The point of non-vocational higher education is … to help students realize that they can reshape themselves—that they can rework the [socialization of] their past … into a new self-image, one that they themselves have helped to create.” 6 These are the words of Richard Rorty, one of the leading pragmatist philosophers of our time. His mentor, John Dewey, who is considered the founder of pragmatist philosophy, described the “educational process [as] one of continual reorganizing, reconstructing, transforming.” 7 I tell parents of new students to UBC, “Your children will change. A university education is— or should be—a transformative experience, not only for what they will learn in the classroom but also for what they discover about themselves, what they encounter in others whose views and backgrounds differ from their own, and for what they come to contribute of themselves to the greater community.” I have had to remind myself of my own words more than once since our elder daughter went overseas to study almost three years ago.  6 7  Rorty, “Education as Socialization and Individualization,” at 118. Dewey, at 50.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 7  John Dewey was telling us a hundred years ago that we must stop “thinking of [education] as … pouring knowledge into a mental and moral hole,” 8 and yet there are still educators and institutions—and parents—who operate from this view of the young person as an empty vessel. The real measure of the value of education, Dewey said, “is the extent in which it creates a desire for continued growth and supplies means for making [that] desire effective in fact.” 9 Dewey declared that a human being’s capacity for learning, and therefore for growth, was dependent on retaining a quality of “childlikeness.” He used the word immaturity in its positive sense, to denote plasticity and the power of potential: sympathetic curiosity, unbiased responsiveness, openness of mind, instinctive mobility, eagerness for variety, and a love of new stimuli and new developments. “The human being acquires a habit of learning,” he said. “[S]he learns to learn.” Habits give a person “the power to retain from one experience something [that may be used] in coping with the [challenges] of a later situation.” The application of intelligence to habit “fixes the relation of the habit to varied and elastic use, and hence to continued growth.” 10  8  Dewey, at 51. Dewey, at 53. 10 Dewey, at 41-53. 9  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 8  We learn to learn, and learning can become a habit—our instinctual response to the new, the unfamiliar, the uncomfortable. If we remain in the habit of learning, then we grow; our self-concept literally expands in order to accept and integrate what before was separate, foreign, even frightening. If we are not in that habit, then we stay small, and what seems foreign and frightening stays so, remains separate and incomprehensible. So: we encourage in our students the application of intelligence to the habit of learning to learn. But how? And what about those individuals who are not our students? Are they not in some measure our responsibility as well? At the heart of UBC’s mission are our commitments—equal in import—to learning, to research, and to engagement with the wider community. So when we talk about our role in developing human potential, we must mean not only the individuals who enter our gates, but also all those who live and move beyond them. How do we fulfill our obligations to them? The answer in both cases is the same: pluralism.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 9  III The Icebreaker Another story: A man sits in the dark on the top deck of a very large ship, all of the northern constellations visible above him in an almost black sky. It’s “bar night” on board, and around him, people are laughing and singing, but the man is in a meditative mood and so he sits at a distance, alone. He hears a small, almost imperceptible sound, and glances down at the drink in his hand just in time to see the ice cube in it crack. The ice cube was chipped off an iceberg earlier in the day, and now, it releases molecules that had been locked inside a glacier since before modern man appeared on Earth. The man in the story is Michael Byers, Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law. He is also the author of Who Owns the Arctic? and a professor at UBC. At the time of this story, he is situated on Pond Inlet at the northern end of Baffin Island, in the Arctic, and he’s traveling aboard the CCGS Amundsen. The Amundsen is an icebreaker—a ship built specially for breaking a passage through icebound waters—and Professor Byers and his fellow passengers are the members of ArcticNet, a federally funded consortium of researchers from 29 different universities. They are there to measure the environment and to search for multi-year ice: ice that survives from  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 10  year to year; that provides the best habitat for seals, narwhales, belugas and polar bears; ice that is melting at a rate three times faster than what scientists predicted. He hears another small sound, and when he glances down again at his drink, the ice cube is gone. 11 As I followed Professor Byers’s progress through the Arctic last summer, I thought about how the icebreaker is a metaphor for, or a microcosm of, the university: a place unto itself but connected to the wider world; a place of study and research that will benefit those outside its confines; a place of collaboration and cohabitation; a safe place for significant conversations about sensitive issues, among people of profound cultural diversity. An icebreaker is a vessel for creating a way forward where before there was none. We use the same word to describe a joke or game used to help people who don’t know each other relax and open up. A third definition of “icebreaker” is a beginning, a start. A university should be the place where students, staff, faculty, and alumni begin to discover both the common humanity and the deep difference between them, and where it’s safe enough to explore the discomfort and the vulnerability inherent in such encounters. It should 11  Byers, at 28-29.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 11  be the place where open, authentic engagement with people whose appearance or customs or worldviews are different from ours becomes a habitual practice, part of our daily lives. A university campus should offer as many avenues as possible along which the human spirit might fly—music, medicine, languages, life sciences, architecture, athletics, business, law, land and food, technology, and art—and its library must offer at least as many more. As a student walks the paths from building to building, class to class, she should begin to notice three things: First: that although she may enter only three or four or five buildings each day, there is teaching and learning going on in all of the buildings. What she is learning, what she will have learned at the end of four years, is just a tiny fraction of what is available to be learned in this place. Second: that although each building she enters is a separate edifice containing a distinct subject matter within its walls, there is a common denominator … and it is she, herself. All of these different realms of ideas are in fact not separate at all, but interconnected with all of the others, and where they connect is within her. And third: that every person she encounters is similarly a connecting point for an astonishing diversity of ideas and understandings and experiences, and that if she wants to expand exponentially beyond what is available to her in the classroom, what she has to do is … say hello.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 12  The 20th-century Polish journalist and poet, Ryszard Kapuściński, said, “Stop. There beside you is another person. Meet him. [Meet her.] This sort of encounter is the greatest event, the most vital experience of all.” If the icebreaker is a microcosm of the university, then the university is—or should be—a microcosm of the world. University is meant to be a liminal experience, a threshold between youth and adulthood, between careers, or between life stages. Time and space outside of ordinary time and space—away from our usual habits and practices, in a place outside our familiar four corners—to investigate who we are in relation to the diversity of experiences, customs, cultures, and values we’re now encountering. And, to imagine who we might yet become. What university leaders must ask ourselves at this juncture in history is whether we are providing that as fully as we possibly can. Universities are one of the only social institutions to have survived, both intact and wildly changed, since the medieval era. We have proven ourselves crucial to social, economic, and cultural evolution, and capable of staying relevant and competitive even during times of highly accelerated change such as we’ve seen this past century. However, the great crises of our time—from climate change to pandemic disease to  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 13  pervasive poverty, from the challenges of cultural diversity to the failure of fledgling democracies and the lack of civil society infrastructure in so many areas of the world—these crises persist, and it is my contention that universities around the globe are no longer optimally organized to do what the world needs us to do. I never thought I’d hear myself say, “We need more meetings!” In fact, comedian Dave Barry once said, “If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race … has not achieved its full potential, that word would be ‘meetings.’” But of course I mean the kinds of meetings Ryszard Kapuściński spoke of. And so every year I find myself strengthening the case for increasing out-of-province and international student enrolment. The flow of university students across borders sparks such meetings and builds nations. It creates lifelong links between individuals and organizations in every sphere of life. A study of the 10 highest-ranked universities in the world shows that international students comprise an average of 21 percent of their student body, which is higher than UBC’s current 18 percent. What’s the connection between international students and a university’s place on the world stage? Those students’ perspectives. Their life experiences. Their cultural heritage. Their unique ways of seeing and being in the world. Every classroom and dormitory becomes a United  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 14  Nations of sorts, and these informal interactions—in group projects, over a shared meal, or in a social setting—give both the local and the international students otherwise unattainable insights into global society. International students carry with them their individual gifts and also their extended networks: the family, business, academic, cultural, and social ties that, when shared reciprocally, can help all of us navigate in a complex world. They also contribute to the global increase of knowledge. International graduate students in particular bring with them the seeds of current and future research collaboration, by tending links among their professors across the global research enterprise. The results are the social policy, health care, and cultural advances we need to tackle the global challenges that are simply too vast for any single institution to move. In other words, the diversity engendered by welcoming international students to local universities—wherever “local” happens to be for you—is crucial to the future well-being of all of us. We need more “meetings.” Currently, UBC enjoys agreements with over 150 other institutions around the world. Student mobility and travel learning opportunities are at an all-time high. However, we have  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 15  an urgent need for greater faculty mobility, but our national systems are not cooperating. There are still many barriers to international recruitment, such as impaired transferability of credentials, especially among the professions, and narrow-minded visa rules. As well, many of our most important funding mechanisms remain inwardly focused and so fail to foster global collaboration. North American universities are also confronted with sub-national constraints. We are partially funded by state or provincial governments, so even recruiting students from a few hundred kilometers away can be controversial. But brilliant hiring and recruitment will not of itself create the critical mass of talent that’s needed to solve fundamental global problems. We need partners. We must collaborate, not only with other universities but also with community groups, civil society organizations, industry, and government. And we must do so more successfully than we have done thus far. Those of you who run businesses may find it hard to understand that just because presidents and vice-chancellors say they would like something to happen doesn’t make it so. Academic freedom is no empty phrase. Truly successful networks and collaborations typically arise in an organic fashion, from the bottom up. We can’t direct this kind of growth hierarchically. But we can, I believe, foster the conditions in which it will happen naturally: by lending our support to fledgling successes instead of reinventing the wheel; by encouraging  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 16  our governments to change rules to allow research funding that crosses borders; by focusing on our strengths instead of trying to be all things to all people; by turning our institutions into communities of practice; and by nurturing global citizens. I will speak more about the ideas of communities of practice and global citizenship in a few minutes. But I cannot leave the subject of pluralism without first addressing what I perceive to be Canada’s—and Canadians’—greatest challenge in that regard. I mentioned earlier His Highness the Aga Khan’s efforts worldwide to nurture a greater understanding and practice of pluralism. His vision will take physical form as the new Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa, in partnership with the Government of Canada. The Centre will serve the global community as an international think tank on the study, teaching, and practice of pluralism. As well as research, education, and professional development, it will provide resources to developing nations on governance reform and building civil society. Canada was chosen as the location for the Centre primarily because of our reputation as one of the world’s most successful pluralistic societies, and also because of the Ismai’li immigrant experience in Canada from the early 1970s onward. “What the Canadian experience suggests to me,” says His Highness, “is that honouring one’s own identity need not  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 17  mean rejecting others.” 12 His Highness is right, and Canadians may rightfully be proud of the successes that led him to choose this country as the home for this visionary enterprise. But … I am a professor. And as Richard Rorty puts it, “The socially most important provocations … will be offered by teachers who make vivid and concrete the failure of the country of which we remain loyal citizens to live up to its own ideals.” 13 I can think of no more vivid, concrete, and current provocation than Attawapiskat. Attawapiskat is the First Nations reserve in northern Ontario that declared a state of emergency this past October. Where people are living in shacks with mould on the walls and using plastic buckets for toilets. Where in 1979, thirty thousand gallons of diesel fuel leaked under the local elementary school and the school remained in session. Finally closed in 2001 because of ongoing health problems suffered by students and teachers, the school still has not been rebuilt and students sit in temporary portables. And the story continues, with floods, sewage overruns, and evacuations into short-sighted solutions that become long-term living conditions. Perhaps worst of all, a  12 13  Khan, Aga, LaFontaine-Baldwin Lecture, 2010. Rorty, “Education as Socialization and as Individualization,” at 123.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 18  hundred other Attawapiskats exist, right here in our home and Native land. 14 This situation is partly a legacy of colonization, and partly of Canada’s Residential School System. Aboriginal people in Canada did not have complete rights until 1982, and those living on reserves were not covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act until 2011—last year. Church and state’s attempts to “civilize” and “assimilate” Aboriginal peoples was in fact a systematic eradication of their identity—their languages, cultures, and communities—through separation of families, forcible repression, and routine abuse. The last of the Indian Residential Schools closed in 1996, but the effects on individuals, their families, and their communities are intergenerational, and continue to this day, and the loss to our society as a whole is incalculable. This is a chapter in our history of which a majority of Canadians remain entirely unaware. Universities have come to understand that we play a role in that ignorance, and must play a role in its remediation. It is also our responsibility to help bring about reconciliation between Canadian society and its institutions, and Aboriginal communities.  14  Foulds, Jim, “After Attawapiskat, what?” on www.thestar.com December 29, 2011, online: http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/1108609--after-attawapiskat-what accessed January 15, 2012.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 19  In November, UBC hosted a dialogue on the history of Indian Residential Schools in Canada. The two-day-long event was held in the First Nations House of Learning, a traditional longhouse situated on our Vancouver campus. University administrators, students, and residential school survivors gathered in a circle to speak, and to listen. In the centre of the circle sat a child’s empty desk, with a blanket laid over the back of the chair. The desk was there to represent the children’s lives that were lost, and those that were so profoundly damaged. As I looked at it, I suddenly understood that this simple school desk, which to me symbolizes education and all its opportunities, represented something utterly different to residential school survivors, and to their children and their children’s children. Many cultures place a high value on formal and particularly western education, and we see those cultures well represented on our campuses. But what about those cultures for whom ‘education’ actually meant eradication? For whom ‘pluralism’ meant assimilation or annihilation? His Highness the Aga Khan cautions us that pluralism is difficult, and that the choices it requires do not come naturally. In fact, for some, it represents unimaginable risk with no reasonable expectation of reward. These times we live in demand that we do it anyway, all of us, discomfort, distance, distrust, confusion, conflict, misunderstandings, mistakes and all. The question is, of course, how?  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 20  IV The Violinist To answer, a short story: A young violinist from Grande Prairie, Alberta, is the local prodigy and the pride of her hometown. She has mastered her Royal Conservatory training, taken first place in festivals across the country, and has just been invited to play as a guest with the philharmonic orchestra in one of the greatest concert halls on the continent. Thrilled, she flies to New York, checks into her hotel, and then instead of trying to hail a cab and because it’s such a lovely evening, she decides to walk to the hall. Well, it’s her first time in New York City, and after a few wrong turns, she’s lost. What’s worse, she’s broken the heel of her shoe, it’s starting to rain and she hasn’t worn a coat, and there’s no time to turn back or she’ll miss the orchestra warm-up. Embarrassed, she approaches a stranger on the street and says, “Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?” The stranger looks at the limping young girl with the wet hair and clothes and the violin case tucked under one arm, and says, “Practice.” I know it’s a chestnut, but consider further…  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 21  I would guess that everyone here has heard someone play the violin, whether at a live concert or on a recording. But have you ever heard someone l e a r n i n g to play the violin? To get good at something, you must practice. And there are two prerequisites for practice: the desire to be good, and the willingness to be bad. As in, learning-to-play-the-violin-bad. To learn to do a thing to any degree of mastery requires first of all that you not be able to do that thing. Not knowing. I don’t know. I’m not sure. I don’t understand. How we hate that! But to learn to play the violin, or to learn to create harmony in a pluralistic world, we need to exercise muscles we have never used; to listen more deeply; to be willing to be uncomfortable, sometimes deeply so; to be willing to be vulnerable in front of our teachers, our fellow practitioners, our friends, and our opponents. Earlier, I described a university as a safe place for significant conversations about sensitive issues among people of profound cultural difference. We must be a place where it’s safe to be a beginner at this, where it’s safe to practice, even for those who’ve earned the title of Master or Doctor. “Practice” and “pragmatism” share similar etymological roots. Simply put, pragmatism is a philosophical approach that gauges the truth of a theory or belief in terms of how successful it is in practical application.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 22  In my role as an international human rights lawyer, my colleagues and I have been investigating the use of a pragmatic approach in the creation of international law. The greatest challenge facing international law today is how to “construct normative institutions while admitting and upholding the diversity of people in international society.” 15 From a pragmatist perspective, law that is imposed, that depends on a hierarchy between law-givers and subjects, 16 is not true law and will not engender the sense of legal obligation among stakeholders that will make it function. The kind of lawmaking we’re proposing, called transactional law, is the result of “reciprocity between all participants in the enterprise,” 17 a collaboration to build … shared understanding[s] and a commitment to uphold a practice of legality. 18 It does “not assume or even aspire to the creation of a shared global identity” or a deep coalescence of values. 19 What is key is that “shared understandings are only likely to arise from repeated social practice.” 20 At this, I have to mention an arena where this is happening all day, every day, all over the world, not only in matters of law but also in politics, the environment, community development, crisis relief, and of 15  Brunnée and Toope, at 21. Ibid, at 7. 17 Brunnée and Toope, at 7. 18 Ibid, at 7. 19 Ibid, at 13. 20 Ibid, at 24. 16  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 23  course celebrity gossip, and that’s online social media. Facebook, just as one example, currently has over 800 million active members—that’s almost 27 times the population of Canada. Three hundred and fifty million of them are accessing their accounts via mobile devices. More than 70 languages are used on the site, and the average member is connected to 130 other individuals and 80 groups. Communities are built on common interest, shared histories, need for information, the desire for connection and for a safe place to disagree. For young people especially, this kind of daily interaction with friends and strangers is a matter of course. What we have the opportunity to do at a university is to help translate that habit into situations where the community of practice is even more diverse and far deeper, to apply knowledge and new research, and from there take it into settings where the stakes are much higher. Informally: at UBC Vancouver, the Simon K.Y. Lee Global Lounge is home base for globally focused student clubs. Over a thousand students gather there for dialogue and action, sponsor programs to foster international engagement and intercultural understanding, and build community with staff and faculty interested in global issues. At UBC Okanagan, we’ve built day residences for commuter students,  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 24  giving them the same opportunity as resident students for the kinds of informal encounters that build friendships. In the classroom, UBC’s Department of Asian Studies is creating a Persian language program that will anchor a broader program in Persian and Iranian studies. The program will include courses in Persian culture and Iranian cinema, and will be headed by a research Chair in Persian Language and Literary Culture. The Ch’nook Aboriginal Business Education initiative, established in 2002, offers a full range of business education opportunities for Aboriginal participants from high school age through working business people and entrepreneurs. Their network includes community leaders, 24 post-secondary institutions, Aboriginal scholars, First Nations bands, and members of Canada’s business community. Emanuel Adler, a professor of International Relations at the University of Toronto, calls these gatherings, from the informal to the formal, communities of practice. These communities “[create] the social fabric of learning.” 21 They are “made up of real people who—working via network channels, across national borders, across organizational divides, and in the halls of government—affect political, economic, and  21  Adler and Pouliot, at 17.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 25  social events.” 22 He suggests that we “think about the world neither as an assemblage of states nor as divided by borders and lines of national identification, but as transnational communities of practice, based on what people actually do rather than on where they happen to live.” 23 According to Adler, and I agree, “the ordinary unfolding of practice [generates] transformation … transformation is the ordinary accomplishment of social life.”24 V Hope and the Global Citizen As I say that out loud, it sounds naïve. Perhaps all of it does—the idea that a first-year university class, a ‘hello’ between strangers, that social media, the beginner mind, language, literature, a global lounge—might be in any way the substrate for the solutions we seek to desperate poverty, economic crisis, climate change, health epidemics, war and terror. But if I look for a common denominator between those things, what I find is hope: the hope of an individual that she’ll grow; the hope of finding friendship; the hope of helping, or of being helped; the hope inherent in starting at the very beginning of something, like the violin or like a Canada that truly includes its First Nations, where everything that lies ahead is unknown and anything is possible.  22  Ibid, at 17. Ibid, at 24. 24 Adler and Pouliot, at 18. 23  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 26  The alternatives are fear and despair, and I believe that the course you follow is a matter of choice. From my efforts as part of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, from my inquiry into Maher Arar’s kidnapping and torture, and from having experienced tragedy in my own life, I know that we can always use what we see in front of us to justify despair. But the ability to envision something better can be learned, too, can become a habit, too. Through casual conversation and formal dialogue; in the classroom and in community service; through hosting international scholars at home and creating opportunities for study and research abroad, universities invite their students, staff, faculty, alumni, and members of the broader community to become global citizens. This is a designation that cannot be conferred by any country or institution but only through participation and practice. We transform ourselves into citizens, and that transformation is sustained by a recognition that, as moral beings, we are here to help one another. That we cannot set someone outside our circle, we cannot turn our back on someone less fortunate than ourselves without in some way compromising ourselves and our own humanity.  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J. Toope, UBC Page 27  I close today with the words of a young girl who was perhaps the quintessential global citizen. She did not attend university; she was never allowed the chance. Yet what she was able to accomplish in her lifetime, and what has been accomplished since through her legacy, can instruct all of us who may feel at times that we are lacking in choice, or opportunity, or freedom. Anne Frank wrote in her diary, “Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don’t know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is!” It is the task of our lives to find out, and to help others to do the same. And it is the task of our universities along with our partners to create, together, a global community of practice in which that may happen— for our students, staff, and scholars, and for all of the people we serve. The time for the best of deeds has come. Thank you. -30-  Ismai’li Lecture Series—Inaugural Keynote Stephen J.

1.0107497~“Everything is included” Copenhagen sustainability lecture series~Toope, Stephen J.~“Everything is Included” Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture Series 27 June 2011 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia Thank you. I want to express my deep appreciation to you for extending this invitation to come to Denmark and spend time with you in this wonderful city. I recently learned that Denmark leads all countries in the world in clean technology as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. Your country is truly an inspiration to us in Canada, and to people around the world. While I’m here I hope I can visit your Green Lighthouse. It sounds wonderful. Although our universities are in different countries on different continents, I believe that we have much in common and much that we can learn from one another. My university, the University of British Columbia, and this one, the University of Copenhagen, share a longstanding and strong commitment to sustainability. We are also of a comparable size and stature that gives us the opportunity and, I would say, the responsibility, to make real contributions to the cause  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 2 of 25  of sustainability, contributions that other organizations may not yet be able to make. In particular I want to speak today about putting our own campuses at the service of research as Living Laboratories. But first, in good academic tradition, let us explain our terms. I was intrigued to see that you have changed the theme of this lecture series from “Climate Change” to “Sustainability.” I applaud this choice. I am one of those people who care a great deal about words and their implications (this is in part because I am a Professor of Law), and when I hear “climate change,” I tend to think of a big, complex, urgent and very serious problem that we all have to fix or fight, or arguably, adapt to. And I think, as I imagine you do, of a great debate marked by information and misinformation, action and inaction. I hear “climate change,” and I also think of a symptom, a symptom of a global disease, almost like a fever. In contrast, when I hear “sustainability,” I think of a way of living. I think of a human value that is inextricably and dynamically linked to natural systems. Sustainability isn’t against anything, or any one. It should have no enemies, and in an important way it takes no sides. Nature is included; the economy is included; culture is included. People—all people—are included. Everything is included. I want to  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 3 of 25  repeat that, because I will refer to it again later: when it comes to sustainability, everything—and everyone—is included. No one, in principle, is against things that last, that are robust and can endure. No one, if they really think about it, wants things to fall apart, hit a wall, go extinct or become intolerable. (Well, perhaps there are a few such people, but the challenge to us all is that for sustainability to be achieved, even they must be included.) Now as much as I admire the concept of sustainability, I won’t deny that there are people who say that the word has lost its meaning. Do they say the same about the word in Danish, too? BAyR-DUk DI-HD? Is that right? Some say that sustainability has been over-used, misappropriated or ruined by the way people define it. I can understand why they say this. But I don’t go along with it. At my university we have an antidote to the “ruining” of the word sustainability. We don’t define it. Why not? Because once you try to pick out sustainability and pin it down as a particular thing, you risk losing sight of its power to widen our gaze and challenge our  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 4 of 25  assumptions. As one of my colleagues often says, “Once you think you know what it is, you’ve stopped thinking.” At my university, and I’m sure at yours too, it’s important never to stop thinking. And so, at UBC we talk about sustainability not as a thing or a process or even a topic of study, but as a conversation. It’s a societal conversation about the kind of world in which we want to live. We recognize that there are social, economic and environmental aspects to that conversation. But we try not to separate these aspects, because, as you may have noticed, once you make categories out of those three—however much you insist that they are all interdependent parts of a three-legged stool—people have an unfortunate tendency to choose sides, or focus on one and reduce or even exclude the others. And so we don’t pin down the word, and we don’t choose sides. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t deeply committed. We are deeply committed. In fact what we say at UBC is that we don’t define sustainability - sustainability helps define us.  Sustainability has been an essential part of our mandate at the University of British Columbia for more than 20 years. It’s been part  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 5 of 25  of every aspect of our University; and by the time I arrived in 2006, I could feel it everywhere. It really does help define us. For example, it was one of our faculty members, William Rees, who originated the concept of the environmental footprint as a measure of human demand on Earth's ecosystems. And UBC’s Clean Energy Research Centre, started in 2000, now offers a Masters in Clean Energy Engineering, and works closely with faculties across the university and with industry partners. One such project is the BC Clean Energy Technology Co-operative. This brings together UBC, the National Research Council of Canada and a utility, Powertech, to unite the expertise of over 200 S&T experts with competencies in 25 areas across 55 specialized labs.  From the point of view of our students, there has been a tremendous passion and enthusiasm for sustainability for decades. It is our goal for every one of our undergraduates to “minor” in sustainability, no matter what the “major” focus of their degree is. We currently have more than 350 courses and 25 programs regarding sustainability throughout our curriculum. Armed with knowledge and awareness of sustainability, our graduates are accelerating the pace of change in almost every profession they enter.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 6 of 25  And from the point of view of our campus operations we have met and exceeded our Kyoto targets five years early, even while our enrollment went up by 48% and our building space increased by 35%. We not only saved money achieving this target, we have saved enough to finance other sustainability endeavors. For example we are bringing more people onto our campus to live, and encouraging public transportation, replacing parking spots with housing. Efforts such as these are bringing about significant changes in the social experience on our campus and with our neighboring communities, changes that will become more and more visible as we move toward zero emissions by 2050, a public commitment we have pledged to fulfill. Now, I don’t want you to think that I’ve come here to brag about our past achievements. Although I am proud of my university, that is not why I mention these things. I’m mentioning them in order to make the following point about those achievements: It isn’t enough. Over the past few years we came to realize that for all the efforts we were making in research, in education and in our campus operations, we were leaving something out. While a tremendous number of activities took place at and through our university, often they were  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 7 of 25  taking place independently of one another. In some cases our faculty was not even aware of initiatives our students were taking with our staff. Everyone was working hard at sustainability but they weren’t necessarily working together. We were not including everything. Universities are in the business of tackling the world’s toughest problems in order to change the world for the better. This is what great research universities are, and this is what they do and what, really, they have done for hundreds of years. Changing the world by advancing knowledge, by cultivating critical thinking, by preparing minds to address the critical issues and tough challenges of the day. But universities are not just minds. They are also, quite obviously, places. At my university we speak very deliberately of UBC as “A Place of Mind.” Our university has a physical presence, a place on this earth. So does yours. These are our campuses. It takes a certain amount of space and a great deal of physical energy and organizational infrastructure to house, support and operate all the research and education that is our primary reason for being. Our physical presence is absolutely necessary, but from an academic  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 8 of 25  perspective it is rarely taken into consideration. It has simply not been a key element of the academic equation. In practical terms, there has long existed a kind of firewall between the academic and the administrative operations of a university such as ours. One is tasked with illuminating the world, the other is asked to keep the lights on. As inseparable and logically connected as they may be, these are quite different functions, and they call on different skillsets. In every university of which I am aware, they are treated not just differently, but also separately. It’s as if academics and operations existed in two distinct worlds, and we weren’t really considering any sort of connection between the two when we thought about sustainability at UBC. But consider this: The University of British Columbia’s largest campus in Vancouver comprises about 500 buildings on about 400 hectares of land. We own and operate all the utilities—electrical, heating, water and waste—and we have our own roads and other infrastructure, our own zoning and other regulations. We are, in essence, our own city with a population of about 50,000 people. Perhaps your four campuses taken together constitute a community of comparable size?  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 9 of 25  What a perfect opportunity to contribute to this conversation about the world we want to live in! Beyond doing our best to reduce our environmental footprint, why not use our own “municipality” as a subject of advanced research on technological, social and economic approaches to sustainability issues? Why not serve as a platform for change? Why not beta-test solutions right here, on campus, at a size and scale that is applicable to other large communities? Why not build on knowledge and actually demonstrate and transfer practical solutions to the wider world? Why not? Good question. Because until rather recently, we weren’t. Nor, as far as I know, were any other of the top research universities in the world. What we were doing was engaging very actively in reducing our energy use, waste production and carbon emissions, and we were doing this rather well, as I have suggested. But we were almost exclusively applying existing, proven technologies. Despite our best intentions, we were not including everything. More specifically, what we were not including was a true, integrated relationship between our core research function and our basic  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 10 of 25  operations, administration and infrastructure. One was researching sustainability and the other was trying to be sustainable, but the two were not in communication with each other. Guess who pointed this out to us? Our students, on the one hand. And pioneering corporations eager to demonstrate innovations in the clean-technology field on the other. Two groups of people who have less interest in the way things have generally been and lots of interest in how things could and should be. “Include everything.” What does this mean? It doesn’t mean “do anything and everything.” In fact, when we set out to develop our Sustainability Academic Strategy, we saw our task as requiring a detailed mindful practice of considering and integrating the many diverse, often ad-hoc activities that arise among our students, staff and researchers. We looked specifically for ways to integrate all our activities under the umbrella of our core academic mission. What is that core mission again? It is to change the world for the better through education, research and— I can now emphasize—through concrete integrated action as a member of a larger global community.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 11 of 25  The effort to develop an integrated Sustainability Academic Strategy has taken some time, and the effort is continuing. The strategy has many components, but the one I want to draw attention to today is what we call the “University as a Living Laboratory”. When we talk about ourselves as a living laboratory, we tend to say things like “students and faculty conducting sustainability research in collaboration with university staff and industrial or community partners working with academic and operational staff.” For those of us who have been living and breathing this effort to integrate our activities, this description may be quite appropriate, but as I share it with you I feel that I could do more to underscore what is different and distinct about our strategy and our Living Laboratory: As researchers, we’re experimenting on ourselves. As owner-operators of a substantial and extensive institution we are offering to take risks that no one else in the larger world is yet prepared or equipped to undertake.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 12 of 25  Consider this: we are stewards of a significantly large and complex urban community. We are capable of entering into partnerships with others to test and demonstrate innovative systems, technologies and social changes in this community – at a size and scale that is transferable to other large, complex urban communities. In UBC’s case we are the sole owner-occupiers of our own utilities, so we are able to fast-track the highly complex process of migrating from a legacy system to a new and perhaps yet unproven one. We are a public institution that has a longer planning horizon than other organizations, especially corporations. While we must carefully plan our finances, we are not forced to publish quarterly earnings reports. We are able to evaluate and consider changes whose benefits may accrue over decades or more. We are an institution with a teaching and research mandate. This means we have more reasons than the simple bottom line for trying a new approach: most importantly a thirst for knowledge. We have access to research funding which we can contribute to strategic partnerships. We can even, if the project fits our academic and  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 13 of 25  operational requirements, invest money from our own operations budget into a research and demonstration project. As owner-operators we have the leeway to try things, and as researchers we have an incentive to try things first. This is the essence of the University as a Living Laboratory. Let me give you an example of how the Living Laboratory pulls together various activities in the entrepreneurial business world, in the more established business world, on our campus and in our research. In my part of Canada, British Columbia, there is a company called Nexterra that is developing systems that convert biomass such as wood waste into synthetic gas, or “syngas.” The syngas can be used by a General Electric Janbacher engine not only to produce electricity but also to make waste heat usable in the form of steam and hot water. This combined heat and power system fueled by waste wood is ideal in the province of British Columbia, as we live in a heavily forested part of the world. The city of Vancouver has a great deal of urban wood waste that has limited uses and in some cases was going directly to landfills. Coincidentally, UBC has aging heating and  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 14 of 25  electrical infrastructure in need of maintenance and upgrading. Furthermore, a member of our own faculty—Professor John Grace in our Clean Energy Research Centre—is a world-leading researcher in the area of bioenergy. Putting all these elements together—integrating our operations and our research with business partnerships—resulted in a proposal for what we call the Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Project. It will be the first steam heat and electrical generating utility with this technology of its size and scale. And it will be incorporated directly into our existing campus infrastructure to be tried and tested. This demonstration project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount comparable to removing 1,100 automobiles from the road while generating enough electricity to power 1,500 homes plus steam heat for some of our buildings. It will get us roughly one third of the way to our 2015 goal of a 33% greenhouse gas reduction from 2007 levels. Because nothing like it had been done at this scale before, it could serve as a model for comparable systems in cities around the world.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 15 of 25  The cost: 27.4 million Canadian dollars, or about one hundred fortyfive million Kroner. How could our operations people, who are accountable for university infrastructure, be convinced to agree to such an experiment? One key reason is that it will save us between 50 and 80 million Kroner over the next 15 years. Simply stated, it made good sound financial sense. How could “the academy” agree to it? Because, although it was an operational project conducted with corporate partners, it certainly fit within our core academic mandate. That is, as researchers, we were genuinely curious to see what would happen and how we could help make it work. How could our Board of Governors agree to it? Well, it made research sense, financial sense and operational sense. Beyond that, however, the final reason is that we all feel a deep commitment to sustainability. If we weren’t prepared to “walk the talk” (as we say in North America), then how could we imagine anyone else would take a risk at this scale?  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 16 of 25  With this demonstration project we combined the four cornerstones that serve as the foundation of our Living Laboratory: 1. Partnerships among researchers, businesses, organizations and the public sector 2. Conducted within our core academic mandate 3. Making sound financial use of our own infrastructure 4. With the prospect of transferring knowledge gained into practical action that changes the world for the better. Does this sound reasonable and straightforward to you? Does it sound like a good idea? A workable approach? A useful academic strategy? Or does it make you shudder in horror at the prospect of unimaginable complexities? Well, I certainly hope you like this idea, because frankly I’m here to sell it to you. I and my university think that you and other universities can and should take this step: to fully integrate your academic mission with your current operations and to fully engage the world beyond your gates in order to facilitate change. The details  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 17 of 25  are of course different depending on situation and context, but I think the concept is fully transferrable. But if you experience a little bit of a shudder, I understand completely. The concept of a living laboratory is relatively straightforward. It is, I believe, easy to see that this approach holds tremendous promise for research universities and for the world as a whole. But as the futurist Paul Saffo often says: “don’t mistake a clear view for a short distance.” Closing this distance—integrating all aspects of the university into a workable living laboratory—is neither simple nor straightforward. So because I hope you will consider implementing a living laboratory strategy yourselves, I’d like to share some of what we learned as we navigated, and continue to navigate, this terrain. My hope is that the following four firsthand insights might be useful to you. First, be prepared to re-think your approach to intellectual property. Universities typically hold on to these rights but seldom have the resources to capitalize on them; but for startup businesses, control of  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 18 of 25  these rights is essential. What we learned was that intellectual property (IP) was becoming an impediment to innovation, not a means to it. So we relaxed our approach to intellectual property. We focused instead on relationships with our partners, and on the fruits of the research, not on ownership. Second, be prepared to challenge traditional organizational roles and coax people out of their comfort zones. In order to integrate academics and operations with outside partnerships you will need to bridge what amounts to different cultures within your university. Consider these different entities: University administrations are classical hierarchies. Their organizational structure looks a lot like a pyramid. Decisions mostly move from the top down, and it is reasonable to expect a certain amount of discipline and allegiance among the staff. Within this hierarchy, Operations focuses its attention completely within the footprint of the campus. Our CFO and Vice President of Operations rarely travels for work. He and his staff are trained to make careful, long-range plans and implement them, taking full responsibility for the entire process. They tend to be generalists by  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 19 of 25  necessity. They are not, as a rule, encouraged to take risks with the smooth operation of the campus. The Board of Governors oversees the overall administration of the university, and they are required to be fiscally responsible because they are the stewards of other people’s money: taxpayers, tuitionpaying students, endowments, donors, and foundations. They are fiscally conservative, for good reason. Now consider the academic community of a university. Its structure, if it has one, is not hierarchical, but almost completely flat. Researchers enjoy academic freedom and, as specialists, are more likely to experience allegiance with a handful of other researchers around the world than to feel any particular loyalty to the University they work for or the campus they work on. And their traditional approach to research is not necessarily in synch with the new demands of a Living Laboratory. Let me explain: the longstanding model for academic research goes something like this: come up with an idea…work on the problem…come up with the answer….share the idea. And the job is done.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 20 of 25  There’s an old joke about a mathematician who goes to a conference and falls asleep in his hotel room. In the middle of the night he wakes up to discover that the couch in his room is on fire. There’s a bucket of melted ice on the table nearby. Seeing the fire and the water, the mathematician says to himself “So. A solution exists.” And, satisfied with himself, he goes back to sleep. Not to be cruel, but academics—and I am one—are to a certain extent rewarded for an approach like this: we are motivated to seek answers and rewarded for discovering them and sharing them publically. But applying the answer is generally not as interesting and not as professionally rewarding for most of us. And yet, it is the entire job of an operations person. So perhaps you can imagine that bringing all these different people— all these different cultures of people—together over a common project can lead to certain difficulties. Perhaps you don’t have to imagine it: perhaps you’ve experienced some of this yourself. We couldn’t predict, as we began developing our Sustainability Academic Strategy and challenging our traditional roles, exactly how or how much our organization would have to change. It wasn’t easy  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 21 of 25  to determine how different people with different skills and responsibilities would even begin organizing themselves. If the organizational structure is too tight and too hierarchical, it won’t be able to facilitate the cross-functional conversations and academic freedom that are necessary. If it’s too loose it won’t have the consistency and follow-through to bring people along and move things forward. We had to feel our way through this. Our organization evolved, adjusting lines of communication, making use of informal connections, having some difficult conversations, building trust and all along the way, finding common ground. It wasn’t always comfortable, but it was productive. My third recommendation is an expansion of the second. Be an agent for social change, and be prepared to change the way you and your larger community behave. The conversation on sustainability is inextricably linked to social behaviour. Changing formal and informal connections, having difficult conversations, building trust and finding common ground are necessary activities not only for changing the organizational behaviour of the university, but also of changing behaviour throughout the community and the broader world. The opportunity exists, for our university and also for yours, to create new  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 22 of 25  opportunities for learning that inspire our communities of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and partners. Technology can only ever be part  of the solution. When we speak of a Living Laboratory we see the social dynamics of our own population of fifty thousand people as an essential subject of study, demonstration and change. We are a laboratory not only for demonstrating new technologies but a living laboratory for investigating different ways to be. The mission of our Centre for Interactive Research in Sustainability illustrates the living laboratory principles. These are: Develop applied technical solutions in building materials and design for commercialization by partners. Combine expert knowledge and public values and preferences in exploring pathways to a sustainable society. Collaborate with private, public and non-governmental organization partners to create superior policy and business decisions for sustainable urban development. Fourth, and my final recommendation: Be prepared not only to work differently, but to work much faster, especially as regards your partners in business.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 23 of 25  Entrepreneurial and innovative companies move at the speed of thought. Academics and administrators are great thinkers too, but they do not, as a rule, move at anything close to the same speed. Since beginning to put our Sustainability Academic Strategy into practice we have become much more nimble. We’ve had to be. At my university the results of these changes have been quite remarkable. For example, once our operations people saw that the sustainability initiatives were economically better and also really exciting and interesting things to work on, they became the most enthusiastic advocates of sustainability in our organization. And they brought with them their experience and skills for making long-range, complicated decisions which added new dimensions to our researchers’ ideas. Once our faculty members understood that the academic integrity of their research was going to be enhanced, not compromised, they got involved. Sure, they remained skeptical; but still, they got involved. Faculty members now actively sit in on every operational committee, and, together with the operational people, make certain that every decision made at our university incorporates thinking grounded in sustainability goals.  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 24 of 25  And finally, the greatest energy source at our university, and probably at yours, remains our students. We seek to do everything we can to honour their passion and prepare them to surpass their teachers. We have a program in place that encourages professors to incorporate our Living Laboratory projects into their courses. We do not offer specific degrees in Sustainability, and that is a conscious decision within our Academic Strategy. As I mentioned earlier, we are working to make sure that every student at our University can make sustainability an integral part of his or her education. Our mission, if you will, is to help prepare people who, no matter what their profession or jurisdiction, will be advancing the conversation of sustainability when they leave us and go out into the working world.  We are, each of us, part of an intricate and intimate global organism. This is true of our universities. It is true of our countries. It is true of our professions, and it is true of ourselves as individuals. If the future that we are all going to share is to be different from the past we carry with us, it will be because we all will have learned to think, to act and to interact in different, more comprehensive ways. We have an opportunity, and, to repeat, a responsibility, to provoke and inspire  Copenhagen Sustainability Lecture 27 June, 2011 Page 25 of 25  continued learning and dialogue that accelerates the progress of sustainability both within our universities and beyond them.  It is no longer enough for us to wear sustainability like a feather in our caps; it needs to become the clothing that we wear every day. The challenge for us all is to keep the conversation on sustainability alive and fresh. To do this we must work to make sure that the subject does not become too special, or too specialized. That our language does not become polarized or exclusive. And that we learn to cross the boundaries between people and learned professions. What we are engaged in is neither a game, nor a battle, but we do want to win, and when we do, there will be no losers. Everything— and every one—will be included. I’m eager now to hear from you. What are you doing? How can we in Canada learn from you? Thank you.  
1.0102599~AUCC centennial membership meeting : “opening us to larger worlds”~Toope, Stephen J.~AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 1 of 21       AUCC Centennial Membership Meeting   26 October, 2011 ‐ Hyatt Regency, Montreal    “Opening Us to Larger Worlds”  Professor Stephen J. Toope   President and Vice‐Chancellor, UBC  Incoming Chair, AUCC    Chers collègues et amis, c’est un grand honneur pour moi d’être  parmi vous en tant que président du conseil d’administration de  l’Association. C’est à ce titre que je m’adresse à vous ce matin, en  souhaitant que mon allocution ne vous soit pas trop pénible.   The occasion of our gathering here, today, is both ordinary and  extraordinary. In its ordinary aspect, we are here for a regularly  scheduled meeting of the Association of Universities and Colleges of  Canada. We have them twice a year, in April and October, and here it  is, October.     Part of what makes this ordinary meeting extraordinary is that it is  also our anniversary. We are gathered here, in Montreal, because   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 2 of 21       one hundred years ago, in McGill’s Redpath Hall (where last night we  enjoyed a dinner and moving remarks from His Excellency, the Right  Honourable Governor General) presidents of Canadian universities  came together for the very first time.     It was, in a broad sense of the term, a convocation. And it began a  series of conversations about the future of Canada and about the  future of Canada and about the role of higher education in that  future. Those dialogues continue to this day. That convocation of  university presidents in 1911 marked the beginning of what is now  the AUCC, and those continuing dialogues—with Canadians and  about Canada—are, essentially, our reason for being.    I use the word “convocation” deliberately. Those of us who hang  around universities use “convocation” a lot, but by habit we use it  narrowly, to refer to our graduation ceremonies. But a convocation is  more than a graduation, and it’s more than a ceremony. From the  Latin convocare, a convocation is a calling together, a calling for a  special purpose.      AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 3 of 21       This meeting has the potential to be extraordinary not only because  it looks back at our history, but because it looks forward; because it,  too, is a convocation: a calling together for a purpose.     Why are we called together, and what is the purpose?    Ceux d’entre nous qui occupent la fonction de recteur consacrent  l’essentiel de leur temps et de leur énergie au progrès leur propre  établissement. C’est un important volet de notre mission, qui peut  bien sûr instaurer un climat de concurrence entre nous. Il est tout à  fait normal que chacun de nous se soucie d’abord de son université,  le contraire serait étonnant. C’est l’une des responsabilités  importantes de tout recteur, mais attention : ce n’est pas sa  principale responsabilité. Ce n’est pas non plus pour cette raison que  nous sommes rassemblés aujourd’hui.    Similarly, AUCC works tirelessly to advance the cause of its  membership—95 public and private not‐for‐profit institutions of  higher learning. As representatives of our common agenda, AUCC  staff often find themselves competing with other groups and   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 4 of 21       institutions for what feels like a particular slice of a finite pie. It’s a  necessary activity, and we as members certainly appreciate, support  and take part in these efforts. But this competitiveness is not our  highest responsibility either. It is an important part of what we do,  but it is not who we are.    Our story is not about competition. It is about contribution.     We are, first and foremost, Canadians whose vocation—our calling, if  you will—is to contribute to the creation and advancement of  knowledge in order to make a positive difference in the world.    Every AUCC leader is responsible for advancing his or her own  particular institution, but today I hope to set aside my compelling  loyalty to and advocacy on behalf of my own university (in spite of  my certain knowledge that it is the most worthy in the world).     As members of AUCC we are all responsible for advancing our shared  agendas, but I also hope today to take advantage of my newness in  this position to set aside the notion of universities as a “special   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 5 of 21       interest group” (without for a minute retreating from our efforts on  behalf of higher education.)     As Canadian stewards of education we share a deeper purpose that  must guide our actions, even if it occupies less of our day‐to‐day  lives. This is what I would like to address today. Our highest  responsibility is to the wellbeing of Canadians, the health of  education in Canada and the ability of higher education to make a  positive difference for people, for our communities, and for the  world.    This responsibility—to Canadians, to Canada and to the world— shapes our story. I want to take the opportunity of this extraordinary  convocation to speak to the story of Canadian universities, and our  contributions first to Canadians as individuals, next in our  communities, and finally as a country both within our borders and  globally.    Nous faisons partie d’un continuum au sein du milieu de l’éducation,  sans lequel le Canada ne pourrait pas prospérer. En cette ère   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 6 of 21       marquée par une accélération du changement, notre tâche consiste à  créer les conditions nécessaires pour que les Canadiens puissent  découvrir de nouveaux univers sans cesse plus vastes, et s’y  aventurer avec succès. Notre ambition est d’ouvrir ces univers aux  individus, aux collectivités et au Canada tout entier.    Cette tâche, nous ne l’entreprenons pas seuls, indépendamment du  reste de la société canadienne, mais plutôt en tant que maillon de la  chaîne de la société canadienne. Le cliché qui veut que les universités  soient des tours d’ivoire réservées à l’élite n’a pas lieu d’être. Chaque  Canadien a un rôle à jouer sur le plan de l’enseignement supérieur,  qu’il soit ou non allé à l’université.     We need to tell this story not only to benefit our own schools, not  only to benefit our collective institutions of higher learning, but  because the wellbeing of our society, our culture and our economy  depends upon it.    Over the past year, looking into our second century, we have  engaged in dialogues within our membership and with others across   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 7 of 21       Canada. We addressed a simple and provocative question: “What  good are universities?” Now, that’s the kind of in‐your‐face question  that universities are famous for. We got a lot of different answers:  economic answers, social answers, cultural answers, political  answers…answers about the importance of education, the value of  research, the contributions of universities to communities. Above all,  we got personal answers. And as we listened, we began to see that  there is a common thread that wove through them all.    Higher education opens us to larger worlds.     This is true for students leaving home for the first time. It is true for  researchers making a discovery that unlocks a mystery of human  health. It is true for neighbours who may never have enrolled in a  university but who benefit from the fact that one exists in their  community. And it is true for Canada and Canadians navigating  through an ever‐expanding and fast‐changing global economy.     The role of higher education in Canada is broad; it includes everyone;  and it is, ultimately, personal. By “personal” I mean that the benefits   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 8 of 21       to Canada flow not merely from universities as institutions, but also  and primarily from the people whose lives have been touched by  them.     Let us consider individual Canadians.     Universities help us discover who we are and they open the doors to  all we might be. They do this not only by imparting knowledge, but  also by fostering growth.    We live in a time when knowledge alone is not enough. The world we  live in is simply changing too fast. Today, economic, social and  personal fulfillment depends less upon what we know and more  upon what we are capable of learning, and the degree to which we  are able to respond to change around us. If the watchword of the  20th century was “security,” the watchword of the 21st is  “resilience.” Universities are sources of skills and knowledge. But  even more important, they are laboratories of change and incubators  of resilience. This makes them unmatched in their ability to produce  global citizens prepared to thrive in ever‐changing conditions.    AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 9 of 21         Le parcours universitaire des étudiants canadiens représente sans  doute la phase la plus marquante de leur vie, l’étape la plus  transformatrice de leur existence. D’un point de vue pratique, les  diplômés universitaires ont de fortes chances de trouver un emploi  gratifiant, qui les comblera. Ils gagnent d’ailleurs en moyenne  1,3 million de dollars de plus au cours de leur vie que les personnes  détenant seulement un diplôme d’études secondaires. En fait, ce que  notre histoire raconte, le plus important, l’essentiel, c’est que les  universités profitent à tous les Canadiens.     As a whole, university graduates lead healthier lives and draw less  upon the healthcare system; they are less likely to become burdens  to the state; they are more likely to volunteer and contribute to their  communities; and from time to time they take really outstanding  scientific, cultural or economic initiatives or inventions, or make  inventions, which benefit the lives of everyone in Canada and,  essentially, make the cost of education worthwhile for all of us.     Taken together, university graduates contribute enough to society to   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 10 of 21       enable all of us to enjoy the benefits of Canadian life that we hold  most dear. Without higher education, Canada would not be a Canada  we could recognize.    Let us turn our attention to communities. Universities transform the  lives of people, and people in turn transform our communities, our  country and the world. Universities are deeply and intricately  engaged in the communities that include them. As economic  enterprises, universities contribute some $30 billion dollars in direct  expenditures to the communities in which they live. That figure is  more than the pulp and paper industry or oil and gas extraction. And  this is not counting the value of new knowledge, new technologies  and new businesses that spring from the minds of university  researchers. For our communities, universities are a resource, a  destination, an economic driver, an artistic and cultural hub, a  catalyst for information and knowledge, and a companion in civic  affairs.     In turn, communities transform universities, shaping their teaching  and research, bringing new ideas and insights to students and faculty.   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 11 of 21         Let’s expand our view again, from communities to country. Here the  benefits to Canada stem from individual contributions of our citizens  plus the considerable impact of globally significant research.     Notre pays a la chance de pouvoir compter sur des ressources  naturelles très importantes. Cependant, la pleine exploitation de ces  ressources exige des compétences de plus en plus spécialisées.  L’enseignement supérieur offre le meilleur rendement qui soit pour  la formation des ressources humaines capables de faire progresser  notre économie en dépit des fluctuations cycliques du marché des  produits de base.     In 1911, approximately 13,000 students were enrolled in some 18  Canadian universities. This year, enrollment has reached one million.  That milestone speaks to an appreciation of higher education among  Canadians. That appreciation, we must realize, is not lost on other  nations. China, for example, recently increased its university  enrolment by one million in the space of a single year. India has   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 12 of 21       identified the need for thirteen hundred new universities in the next  decade. The emerging stars of the 21st century global economy,  countries such as China, India, Korea and Brazil – have each placed a  premium on investing in higher education.   Our future will be shaped, from within our borders and outside of  them, by changes wrought by a growing population of creative,  highly trained, well educated and ambitious global citizens. We can  see the choices others are making. A wit once said “Even if you’re on  the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.”     Research is another primary driver for Canada as a country, and here,  too, people are the primary drivers—and the primary beneficiaries— of great research.     Canada thrives by providing a supportive habitat for talent.  Universities, aided by federal and provincial governments, have  worked to create the conditions that attract people from around the  world, and that keep talented Canadians here, enabling them to do  their best work at home. Canada’s stature on the world stage rests   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 13 of 21       on this capability. And all of Canada participates in and benefits from  this enterprise, which requires not only advanced research facilities  but also lively, safe, diverse and inclusive communities that serve as  magnets for people who could choose do their work anywhere on  earth.     Éducation, engagement communautaire et recherche.     Ces trois volets nous ouvrent à de plus vastes horizons et nous  préparent à y évoluer avec succès. Ce sont les trois piliers de notre  mission au service de l’enseignement supérieur. Les recteurs les  connaissent très bien. Pourtant, chaque établissement se distingue  par la manière dont il mène ses activités. L’éducation, la recherche et  l’engagement communautaire ne sont pas non plus l’apanage des  universités : elles font partie du tissu même de la vie canadienne.  C’est ce qui les rend si importants, et rend notre mission à leur égard  absolument essentielle au bien‐être de chacun d‘entre nous.     There are 95 universities and university‐level degree‐granting  colleges within our Association, and I think it is safe to say that there   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 14 of 21       are at least 95 different ways that our members are responding to  the needs of Canadians and manifesting these three elements of our  shared mission. That is evidence of the resilience that has kept  universities useful and relevant through times of change, not only  during the past century in Canada but over nearly a millennium since  their origins in the early middle ages.    This resilience stems from a dynamic balance between conservatism  and change. We are living now in a time of intense change, and our  universities individually and as a group are reflecting, responding and  in many cases leading change; and that is important and necessary. I  want to speak about conditions that are sparking evolution and  change in Canada, but first it is important to recognize that, as  universities evolve together with Canada, we must always hold firmly  to the enduring values that guide us:    1. Learning. It is the creation, not just the transmission, of  knowledge.   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 15 of 21       2. Academic freedom. Reasoned discourse, rigorous and extensive  research and scholarship, and peer review.     3. Collegiality. We are, in fact, communities of highly diverse  independent learners.     4. Openness. Academic freedom brings with it the responsibility to  be transparent and accountable. And lastly,     5. Results. We are called not only to create knowledge and pass it  along, an important mission, but also to respond to issues that  affect individuals, communities, societies, and the world.     This last point, this focus on accomplishing meaningful change, I call  our responsibility.     While we hold fast to these enduring values that make us who we  are, we are called to adapt continuously to the changing needs of  Canadians. Our ability to respond is, indeed, our responsibility.      AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 16 of 21       Chacun des 95 établissements membres de l’Association est sensible  à ce qui passe autour de lui et réagit constamment à l’environnement  local et mondial. Au cours de l’année, les membres de l’AUCC ont  participé, partout au pays, à des échanges intenses; ils ont discuté  des besoins émergents des Canadiens, des changements qu’ils  observent, ainsi que des mesures qu’ils adoptent pour répondre aux  situations.     Drawing on all this input, AUCC staff and members have worked over  the past year to identify and articulate five perennial and emerging  needs, needs that we, collectively, as stewards of education, are  committed to addressing. I want to share these commitments with  you today and I look forward to discussing them with you in detail.     We share these five commitments as we enter our second century:    1. We commit to broadening the view of education. Universities are  part of a larger landscape of education and we cannot, alone,  contribute fully to Canada unless that entire landscape is healthy  and robust. We are committed to invite and lead a conversation   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 17 of 21       across Canada regarding the entire experience of education from  preschool to post‐doctoral, for the good of all Canadians.    2. We are committed to innovation in learning New research into  teaching and learning and new technologies are providing a host  of learning tools and approaches. Our three pillars of education,  research and community engagement are increasingly converging,  with opportunities for a more deeply integrated learning  experience. We are committed to enhancing the learning  experience of undergraduate, graduate and professional students  by drawing on a full range of educational, research‐based and  community‐focused opportunities enriched with global  engagement and new technologies.     3. We affirm our commitment to excellence We share a responsibility  to ensure that every student is fully equipped to play a role in a  larger world and in a very new kind of Canada.     4.  Nous nous engageons à trouver des solutions aux grands  problèmes de notre monde. Nous sommes déterminés à accroître   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 18 of 21       les études aux cycles supérieurs et à adhérer à un solide  programme de recherche en vue de générer de nouvelles  connaissances et de trouver des solutions aux grands problèmes  de notre monde de plus en plus complexe.   and  5. We are committed to cultivating engagement and partnerships.  We reach beyond our institutions to cultivate alliances, working  relationships and initiatives of shared purpose. We work with and  learn from community organizations and social groups in order to  research and implement solutions to local and global problems.  We invite partnerships with business within our academic  mandate to improve the transfer of knowledge to the  marketplace. We will work with one another in collaborations  among universities within Canada and around the world. By  joining forces we are better able to address highly complex issues  and accelerate the pace of research.     These are big, open‐ended commitments. We share them with all  Canadians, yet they challenge and encourage each of us differently.  Later today we will have the opportunity to meet and to address   AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 19 of 21       these commitments in greater detail. It will be, I trust, the beginning  of a vital conversation that will lead us into a productive and inspiring  second century.    Canadian higher education is not a one‐size fits all proposition. There  are many kinds of intelligence; there are many styles of learning; the  world needs a vast palette of skills and talents to function well. If  there is one thing that is true across the board, it is that Canada’s  future (If I may borrow a phrase from the Right Honourable Mr.  Johnston) is that of a “smart and caring nation.” To thrive, as  individuals and as a country, each one of us must achieve our full  potential, whatever it may be, and apply it with full commitment, in a  smart and caring manner. This is the means by which we open  ourselves to larger worlds. And we stewards of higher education  enjoy the privilege and bear the responsibility of assisting in every  way we can.    Our convocation is under way. Perhaps, indeed, it’s never been  adjourned. We are called together to continue the building of a great  country. Canada.    AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 20 of 21         Tous ici présents, nous avons pour mission de faire progresser  l’enseignement supérieur et de permettre à tous ceux qui le  souhaitent d’y accéder, au bénéfice de tous les êtres humains du  monde. En réalité, nous sommes, au Canada, tous appelés à remplir  cette mission. Nous formons une immense collectivité d’apprenants  interdépendants, et chaque personne sera un jour ou l’autre  touchée, de près ou de loin, par ce que nous faisons ou avons fait.     Let me express this one more time, with a particular image. Once  upon a time, humans harnessed fire. And that made all the  difference. Some live to tend the flame. Some warm themselves  nearby. Some learn the physics of combustion and carry away sparks  to ignite innovation in new areas. But all of us contribute to the  warmth and all of us benefit from the light. This is an ageless,  uniquely human responsibility. It is a testament to our humanity that  we tend these beacons, from the first fires to the latest lasers. The  tools continue to change, but the purpose remains the same.      AUCC Centennial  26 October, 2011  Page 21 of 21       We are called together in order to penetrate dark corners and  illuminate larger worlds. However you look at it, there is nothing  more important than this.     Thank you. I look forward to our continuing conversation.       
1.0107503~Lunar New Year luncheon~Toope, Stephen J.~Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Thank you, Carmen (Lee). Good afternoon, everyone. Once again, I am honoured to be here with you to celebrate another Lunar New Year; to usher in the year of the rabbit.  2010 ended on a high note for me. I was in Asia just before the holidays and had a wonderful time meeting with alumni in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. I had some very productive meetings with our long-standing partners in these cities, as well as some new and prospective partners from various research universities and private organizations, and signed two very important global research agreements.  During these Asian alumni visits, I reported at length on the many examples of UBC’s progress toward fulfilling the various commitments and goals contained in our strategic plan, Place and Promise. But as  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 2 of 7  encouraging as these early results are, I think you will find it much more enjoyable to simply go on-line – strategicplan.ubc.ca – and read our most recent annual report to see for yourself just how much progress there has been on a number of fronts.  Instead, what I would like to do today is to focus on the words, “commitments” and “goals” – the two words that are at the heart of Place and Promise, and that provide the plan’s structural framework.  Let’s stretch our imaginations for a moment. Imagine it is 1963, and we are at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC to hear Martin Luther King address a crowd of 200,000 in what civil rights historians have long revered as the “I have a dream” speech. Like practically everyone in attendance, we are deeply moved by the magnificent oratory.  But what exactly was it about that speech that propelled the American Civil Rights Movement so convincingly toward its desired conclusion? Was it the sermon-like delivery? Was it the penetrating eloquence of a  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 3 of 7  masterful orator? Perhaps it was the evocative phrases and powerful imagery the speech conjured.  Surely it was all of these things, but if you had to boil it down to its single most important element, what would it be? The question is far better suited for writers and linguists, but I would like to suggest that the most important element was the repeated use of the word “dream” to describe Martin Luther King’s commitment to freedom and equality… the repeated use of the word “dream” to describe his goal of a legislated end to racism… and most importantly, the repeated use of the word “dream” to exemplify his passion for those aspirations.  Indeed, one assumes that his speech would not have resonated quite so thoroughly had he said: “I have an idea” or “I have a goal” or “I am committed to changing things.” My point is not that we should try to emulate Martin Luther King when talking about UBC and the power of people, learning and innovation to invoke societal change… but it wouldn’t hurt to inject a small amount of our deeper convictions into our lexicon of thought and expression.  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 4 of 7  We don’t have to look far to see the power of individuals who think big things, the power of those with passion in their convictions, the power of those who dream. Almost exactly 25 years ago to this day, a young UBC alumnus named Rick Hansen wheeled up the Great Wall of China near Beijing in his quest to circumnavigate the globe in a wheelchair. At the summit of the climb, he told reporters: “If you believe in a dream and have the courage to try, great things can be accomplished.”  A year later, another UBC alumnus named Bob Lee formed UBC Properties Trust in pursuit of his dream to raise a billion dollars to secure his university’s future, a dream that is on track to becoming reality with over $650 million raised to date, and we are still counting. Thank you, Bob.  Dr. Weihong Song and his research team from the UBC Faculty of Medicine have a dream to offer new hope to people coping with the devastation of Alzheimer’s Disease. We were elated to learn, just last week, that Dr. Song’s team has taken a giant step toward realizing that dream. With support from the David Townsend Family, they have discovered the genetic mechanism that triggers the destruction of  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 5 of 7  neurons in patients with Down’s Syndrome and Alzheimer’s Disease – a discovery that now provides them with a potential new target for drugs that may forestall dementia.  And if we really want to see dreams in action, we need only talk to our students – including the thousands of UBC undergraduate students who demonstrate their passion for learning by undertaking what Place and Promise describes as Enriched Educational Experiences. These experiences can take the form of community or international service learning opportunities, first-year small class experiences, co-op work placements and mentorships, or undergraduate research projects – all designed to provide deep learning through practical experience and meaningful interactivity. And all designed to enable students to fulfill their dreams of fulfilling careers following graduation.  My point is that I think we all need to inject a bit more passion into our discussions about UBC. We need to match the level of passion and conviction that our students exhibit today – students who are not doing extraordinary things in order to achieve a goal, but to realize a dream. We also need to match the level of passion and conviction of our  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 6 of 7  researchers, who are doing extraordinary things in an effort to solve our most complex problems.  I learned shortly after I arrived at UBC that this alumni group represents a community of influence. And so, within your various spheres of influence, my request is that you speak with conviction about UBC, about what we, as a university community, are positioned to achieve, and about how the time is right to further build upon the strong foundation we have today. UBC is better placed than any public university in North America today to become a global leader in life sciences, in clean energy, in economics, in cold matter physics, in enhancing the undergraduate experience.  And in the back of our minds, we can fuel that conviction by being acutely aware of an exciting new phenomenon that has begun to unfold. The rise of the social sector that writer and economist Peter Drucker once predicted is becoming a reality in new and amazing ways. Some of the world’s wealthiest people are now pursuing bold new dreams, not focused on building bigger companies, not on amassing further wealth, but upon distributing their fortunes in a manner that  Lunar New Year Luncheon 18 January 2011 Page 7 of 7  aids human kind in the greatest possible numbers. And they are convincing like-minded counterparts throughout the world to do the same. This is an incredibly significant development because major research universities like UBC are natural partners in fulfilling these bold new dreams.  Above all, we must simply believe that we can take UBC to the next phase of the journey we have collectively charted. We can have an even more powerful engine of social, cultural and economic development in our midst – as powerful as exists anywhere in the world.  But only if we think, speak and act with conviction and with passion, and only if, when and because… we dream - - together.  Thank you once again for being here today – good health and good fortune to all.  
1.0107509~UBC equity, diversity and intercultural understanding colloquium 2012~Toope, Stephen J.~UBC Equity, Diversity and Intercultural Understanding Colloquium 2012 April 05, 2012—The Longhouse Thank you, Larry [Grant], and thank you all; it’s an honour to have been invited to speak at the inaugural Colloquium on Equity, Diversity and Intercultural Understanding, and to celebrate this significant ‘first’ with you.

We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.”  Neglect of the needs of migrant students in our public schools.

The integrity of place-based learning at a university that rests on traditional Aboriginal lands. 1  My gut clenches and at the same time my heart sings when I look over the topics to be presented today. The most valuable exercise a university can undertake is genuine dialogue. What comes up for discussion today may be frightening, even threatening; ideas may be observed, analyzed, questioned, set aside, even jettisoned. But not the communication itself. And perhaps the higher the tension, the greater the potential reward.  Note: All of these are paraphrased from the topics of papers to be presented by graduate students at this Colloquium. 1  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 3  Tension is defined as “a stretching,” or “the condition of being stretched.” And we are. All 19,000 faculty and staff, all 55,000 students. All of UBC, stretched between our present state and the commitment we made, the promise we made to our stakeholders and to the community we serve, to become an institution of intercultural understanding and fluency.  We committed to nothing less than a re-imagining of the University—an act of great creativity and courage that requires, paradoxically, a great deal of tension.  Artists, perhaps better than most people, understand the dynamic energy inherent in tension, and its power to provoke a creative response. Musician James Taylor described music as a huge release of the tension between his vision and what he was able to convey with instruments and voice. Actor Annette Bening  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 4  described movies as lightning in a bottle, waiting for a spark of tension from the actors to illuminate the story and ignite the action. Choreographer Twyla Tharp talked about the energy that comes from tension, and said that when directed properly, it can result in laughing together! And poet Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “The world is all gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck.”  UBC is home to every imaginable form of diversity, including gender, sexual orientation, indigenousness, mental and physical ability, religion, racial, ethno-cultural, socio-economic status, regional, and above all intellectual diversity. All gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck. But contact with diversity does not in itself produce intercultural understanding. Tension, in and of itself, does not engender a creative response.  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 5  For UBC to remain a global leader among institutions of higher learning, intercultural experiences must be intentionally and structurally embedded in both the academics and the operations of the University. So when we opened the office of Intercultural Understanding Strategy Development, our first task was to test our assumption that what UBC needed was more such experiences. We hired a Director. We conducted a literature review and a University-wide activity audit. And what we learned surprised us. In the ‘good news’ category, we discovered within the first two months that there were more activities, initiatives, trainings, and programs happening, at every level, than we could actually capture. Just as one example, we found 14 training programs in intercultural fluency! In the ‘bad news’ category, within the same period of time, we quickly realized that literally  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 6  all of it was occurring in isolation. Of those 14 training programs, for example, not one of them knew the other 13 existed.  The work that lies ahead of us falls not into the realm of generating more activity; rather, it is now a matter of institutionalizing these scattered but significant successes, providing infrastructure and resources, tapping the best practices they’ve created, and implementing them across the University as a whole. Student Services is training staff advisors to work with inresidence and international students using the very latest theories and methods pertaining to equity, diversity, and intercultural fluency. But they don’t have the capacity to train everyone. Likewise, the First Nations House of Learning is the centre of excellence, bar none, for creating a safe environment for difficult conversations. But not all the tough conversations that need to take place at UBC can happen in the Longhouse. The Centre for  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 7  Intercultural Communication, in Continuing Studies, offers a full range of courses and a Certificate in Intercultural Studies. But there is no equivalent for-credit program at UBC.  How do we parlay these successes into University-wide practices? How do we avoid adding to the heavy workloads both staff and faculty already bear? How do we not turn everything into another workshop? Most of us are workshopped out. We are almost certainly pilot-projected out.  How do we ensure that the critical research you’re conducting, and will present here today, reaches not just this roomful of people but a campus-ful? A city- or province- or country-ful?  I’m going to leave you with these questions, because I don’t have answers yet. I hope you’ll hear them as a challenge. You are our  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 8  brightest and best. I invite you to come back to my office, or to the Equity office or the Intercultural Strategy office, with ideas so bold they scare you. Ideas threaded with strings of tension waiting to be struck.  You are learned enough to be able to play a leading role in creating systemic change; unfettered enough in your thinking to be relatively fearless; and creative and committed enough to direct that tension toward positive change. It’s a powerful combination.  I have said in the past that Canadian universities too often shy away from the social realities of deep diversity, prizing comfort over robust and challenging debate. But not here, not today. From what I have already seen, I expect the ideas you have to share today will make more than a few people tense. May your guts  Equity and Diversity Colloquium April 05, 2012 Stephen J. Toope—Page 9  clench and your hearts sing! And may your minds always be asking how we take the next step forward. Thank you.  -30-  
1.0107491~Don’t swallow these innovation nostrums~Toope, Stephen J.~Don’t swallow these innovation nostrums From Monday's Globe and Mail Published on Friday, Aug. 27, 2010 7:11PM EDT  Canada has basked in the global spotlight this year, with a golden Olympics, two international summits and continued evidence that our economy is outperforming other G8 countries. Yet, for more than a decade, one report after another has identified innovation gaps in Canada and offered warnings about our lagging productivity and future prosperity. This mixed picture reinforces our scepticism about some of the quick fixes on offer to close the innovation gap and transform our economy. We review seven such nostrums: Canada must urgently reduce its dependence on the resource sector. Yes, economic diversification makes sense, but so does promoting innovation in mining, forestry and energy production. Canada has massive advantages – research and development in resource-based industries and agriculture will increase our longterm prosperity and the sustainability of those sectors and our natural environment. The high-tech sector is the cornerstone of our future prosperity. Yet, while information and communications technology (ICT) dominates the high-tech sector, it accounted for only 3.3 per cent of Canadian jobs in 2008, unchanged since 2002. The definition of high-tech is also ambiguous. For example, the ICT tally includes unskilled manufacturing jobs, advanced research labs and family operated computer service shops. Of course, there are golden opportunities for growth in ICT, medical devices, aerospace and biopharmaceuticals, among other high-tech fields. But Canada has to innovate in all sectors – including manufacturing and services – to compete and win in the decades ahead. Better commercialization of publicly financed research is the key to accelerating innovation. Universities, colleges and hospitals could all do better at turning discoveries into marketable services and products. But Canada’s total R&D spending as a percentage of GDP is middle of the pack in the OECD, primarily due to Canada’s low and falling level of spending in business R&D. Thus, while researchers in public institutions will continue to push out ideas and inventions, it’s the receptor capacity in the private sector that needs urgent attention. Government must limit wasteful spending on “curiosity driven” research. This zombie idea just won’t die. Most universities and colleges are keen to build mutually beneficial partnerships with industry, and much publicly funded research is already oriented toward applications. But basic research in science and technology can define whole new segments of industrial development, while novel insights from the social sciences and humanities help animate successful societies. Above all, students who do independent research learn problem-solving skills that will make them invaluable innovators in a range of industrial and non-profit environments. Government should prescribe the commercialization model for institutions receiving public funds. In the commercialization of publicly financed research, pluralism reigns at home and abroad. Israel, Singapore and the United States have  done well by assigning ownership of intellectual property to institutions, not individual researchers. In those countries, however, successful institutions give a big share of the revenue back to the inventors, focusing first on getting ideas to market, not on their own proceeds. That said, primary inventor ownership is clearly workable, especially for rapid-cycle fields such as software. All things considered, we think it makes little sense for governments to waste political capital trying to micromanage the supply chain of ideas and inventions from independent institutional research. Canada must set priorities for R&D spending aligned with an innovationbased economy. We estimate that taxpayers contribute more than $5-billion a year for regional development agencies, for R&D tax credits to private companies, and for labs managed by the National Research Council or directly by federal and provincial governments. Effective spending of this money under direct government control is arguably the starting point for any critical review. That said, governments everywhere have a mixed record when it comes to targeting external research spending or picking commercial winners. The R&D priority lists of governments across Canada also commonly include clean-tech, ICT and life sciences – essentially mirroring those of many other countries. At risk of heresy, we suggest that governments focus instead on creating the most generous environment possible in support of rigorously competitive excellence in R&D, entrepreneurship and early stage enterprises. Universities and colleges should focus on educating more students in science and technology. Canada lags leading OECD countries in degrees granted per capita for many disciplines at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Many of our most successful business leaders and social innovators are arts or social science graduates. No one knows what the optimum mix of students should be. But as we read the evidence, independent-minded university and college graduates from diverse backgrounds are critical to building creative societies with innovative foundations. So it seems logical that a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship should be promoted in all sectors of the economy, not least social agencies, non-profit enterprises, public administration, and postsecondary and health-care institutions. Such a shift depends on long-term planning and sustained effort. There are no short cuts, and quick fixes may do more harm than good.

1.0107510~Sometimes Canada gets it right~Toope, Stephen J.~|* Originally appeared in The Hill Times, 30 January 2012  Sometimes Canada gets it right In a country where jurisdictional wrangling often impedes progress, the Knowledge Infrastructure Program stands out as an example of three levels of governments working together for the benefit of all Canadians. By STEPHEN J. TOOPE, DAVID NAYLOR || Jan. 30, 2012 The fall of 2008 was not a happy time in Canada. Canada was slipping into a global recession, a just-returned third minority Parliament was cranky and Canadians were increasingly cynical about the capacity of government to respond to real and urgent needs. These were not what would normally be called winning conditions for public policy success. In the fall of 2011, things are better but sunny days have not returned. The economic future remains cloudy. Perhaps, then, it’s worth taking a time-out from the gloom to celebrate something that governments and the private sector got right. The federal government announced the Knowledge Infrastructure Program as part of the 2009 stimulus budget. What began as a direct investment of $1.3-billion from the federal government was leveraged—with funding from the provinces, municipalities and the private sector—into an investment of $3.2-billion to upgrade and renew research and learning facilities on university campuses across the country. These investments are having an impact today, and will help shape the future of higher education, research, and innovation in Canada for years to come. Equipped with these resources Canadian universities set about upgrading, expanding, or building new state-of-the-art labs, libraries and learning spaces. In some cases, the projects addressed the pressing need for increased student capacity.  At the University of Toronto’s Mississauga campus, the new Instruction Centre includes a full range of technology-enabled classrooms varying in size from 30 seats to a 500-seat auditorium, dedicated study space and a 24/7 computer lab. Others made dramatic contributions to sustainability. At the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus, the new GeoExchange system uses groundwater from under the campus to heat and cool buildings, making the campus almost emissions-free. Several aspects of the Knowledge Infrastructure Program were unusual. The first was its speed. The program went from initial discussions to announcement in just six weeks. And the program moved from announcement to project funding decisions in just six months. A total of 183 projects on 79 campuses were approved. Universities, not always known for rapid decision-making, committed to completing the projects in two years. Some kitchen renovations take longer! As well, in a country where jurisdictional wrangling often impedes progress, the Knowledge Infrastructure Program stands out as an example of three levels of governments working together for the benefit of all Canadians. The responsibility for delivering the Knowledge Infrastructure Program fell to Industry Canada—not typically a program delivery department. Yet a team was assembled that reviewed proposals, hammered out a deal with each province and monitored progress. Virtually all of the projects were completed on time and on budget. Such alignment and speed of action across three levels of government, the private sector, and universities across the entire country is unprecedented. Obviously, the private sector players saw in the program relief from what could have been a massive slowdown in the building industry. Yes, the provinces and federal government were compelled to act to stimulate the economy and to play nicely with each other, and municipalities stepped up to the plate to do their part. Granted, too, that universities had a back-log of capital needs. But what strikes us was the spirit of partnership and collaboration shown by all involved in delivering the Knowledge Infrastructure Program. It animated staff at Canada’s universities, hundreds of contractors and thousands of construction workers, individual and corporate donors, and all levels of government. It also built important facilities that will benefit hundreds of thousands of future students.  In November 2011, Canadian universities hosted public events to showcase all these new labs, libraries and learning spaces. Roughly 10,000 people attended, and we suspect many were families and friends of our own staff. No surprise there: these facilities aren’t exactly tourist attractions. But as two university presidents from opposite sides of the country, we thought it still might be useful to send out a few public bouquets. Some things do get done surprisingly well in this sometimes frustrating country and these frustrating times. And as two citizens, we are also left wondering how, without a crisis like that of 2008 or the inspiration of an Olympic Games, Canadians might regularly rekindle the social solidarity and collaborative culture that drove forward the Knowledge Infrastructure Program.

1.0107512~Building bridges from B.C. to Brazil : ties being developed through student exchanges will provide a foundation for future relationships that benefit all~Toope, Stephen J.~Building bridges from B.C. to Brazil; Ties being developed through student exchanges will provide a foundation for future relationships that benefit all Vancouver Sun Wed May 2 2012 Page: A13 Section: Issues & Ideas Byline: Stephen Toope and Arvind Gupta In our rapidly evolving global context, Western nations, including Canada, are asking the question "To whom does the future belong?" We watch with wonder, and not a little envy, as emerging economies spread their wings and take off, seemingly overnight. Countries that have struggled with poverty and development are becoming economic miracles, blessed with stratospheric growth and a new-found confidence to compete in complex industries with established world leaders. Brazil is one of these new powerhouses. With a population of more than 190 million, Brazil is set to become one of the world’s top five economies. It is pursuing a bold future, and a key part of its strategy is a commitment to invest significant resources in higher education and research, particularly in so-called STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And what of Canada’s interest in this? We must not be content to sit back, admiring the determination of our southern friends. Rather, this is the time to generate strong new partnerships with Brazil that will secure future opportunities for British Columbia, and Canada. That is why we have travelled to Brazil as part of a delegation of 30 university presidents, members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada – a delegation led by Gov.Gen. David Johnston and a number of high-level officials including Gary Goodyear, minister of state for science and technology. Included in that group are five B.C. institutions: the University of B.C., the University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, Kwantlen Polytechnic University and Royal Roads University. Mitacs, a national not-for-profit research organization with head-quarters at UBC, is also part of this mission. This is an unprecedented effort by Canada and we are driven by a conviction to be "fast out of the gate" in building solid bridges that foster real, long-lasting benefits to both countries. You will no doubt hear that we will be busy signing many agreements with the country’s leading universities to advance research collaborations and student exchange, and, of course, these are important. But the true bedrock from which these bridges will be built is authentic people-to-people relationships. Personal connections provide durable bonds that ensure two-way flows of knowledge, innovation and business opportunities. Personal bonds not only cross borders, but are much more sustainable through time and inevitable difficulties.  This week we are already seeing the fruits of our efforts as we witness the Brazilians welcoming our initiatives to build relationships with their institutions and industry. In fact, we expect to see students and researchers flowing back and forth to British Columbia in the very near future. One concrete example is the announcement in Sao Paulo of more than $10 million in new funding from the governments of Brazil and Canada, various provinces, universities and Mitacs. With this innovative program, 450 of Brazil’s best undergraduate students will come to Canada on summer internships over the next three years. They will also have the chance to come back through a novel national graduate fellowship at Canadian universities, including our own. This is the Mitacs Globalink program which has already recruited star students from India and China since 2009. Brazil is showing inspiring foresight by launching the visionary Science Without Borders program which will provide 100,000 scholarships to Brazilian students to study in the world’s top postsecondary institutions. The sheer scope of this initiative is an indicator of Brazil’s ambition. During our trip, Brazil has committed to targeting 12,000 of these scholarships for study in Canada, and we are positioning B.C. to be a major recipient. We all win when dynamic and innovative countries, institutions and people get closer to each other. UBC has long made it an important educational goal to be a destination for the world’s best students and researchers. They infuse campus life and research with fresh insights, perspectives and approaches. They forge international friendships that benefit global society, and collaboration that fosters global prosperity. The connections made this week will help nurture nascent Brazil linkages to B.C. universities that already include a variety of exchange agreements and growing university-industry research collaborations in areas of importance to B.C., such as mining engineering and visual analytics. To be sure, there is a lot of competition to get Brazil’s attention as the world wakes up to the opportunities it offers. The high-profile state visit led by our governor-general is a strong step in the right direction.

1.0102610~Groundbreaking for the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health~Toope, Stephen J.~Groundbreaking for the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health Tuesday, October 11, 2011 — UBC Hospital Parking Lot Professor Stephen J. Toope, President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests, and friends of UBC, it is my sincere pleasure to welcome you to the University of British Columbia today and to celebrate this event with you. I have a story I want to share with you. Some of you may know of it already. In 2006, a neuro-anatomist named Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor had a stroke. A blood clot in the left hemisphere of her brain robbed her of her ability to walk, talk, read, and write. She could no longer think in a linear fashion, recall any of her past, or conceive of a future. For her, suddenly, there was only the present moment, only a collage of sights and sounds and tastes and physical sensations forming a kaleidoscope of ‘now.’ For the next several years, there was only the world as the right hemisphere of her brain experienced it: expanded, interconnected, and so wondrous as to be at times overwhelming. And Dr. Taylor was locked inside that world. In the midst of massive injury, she came to appreciate this altered experience, and she remembered it. So that eight years later, fully recovered, she was able to write a book about it, present a TED Talk about it, and share it with the world. The conclusion her experience led her to was this (quote): “I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me ….We are [all] energy beings connected to one another …. as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,  Centre for Brain Health Groundbreaking Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 3  here to make the world a better place.” 1 She called this her ‘stroke of insight.’ I was prompted to share this story after reading a quotation I noticed on the Djavad Mowafaghian Foundation website, from the medieval Persian poet Saadi. It opens like this: The children of Adam are limbs of each other, having been created of one essence. When … calamity … affects one limb, the other limbs cannot remain at rest.2 We are all connected. When one of us is weak, the rest are weakened. When one of us grows stronger, we are all strengthened. Together, we are more, and better, than we can be on our own. In this quotation, and in that story, I see a reflection of all that we are aspiring to achieve with this Centre for Brain Health: • collaboration between UBC’s Faculty of Medicine and Vancouver Coastal Health; • partnership with and support from our Provincial and Federal governments, as well as the kindness, forward thinking, and generosity of friends of UBC; 1  From Jill Bolte Taylor’s TED Talk at: http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html  2  http://mowafaghianfoundation.com/founder/  Centre for Brain Health Groundbreaking Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 3  • an inclusive approach to brain health that unites research in neuroscience, geriatric medicine, mental health, and addiction medicine; and • a union of research and patient care in the same physical space. A stroke of insight is of benefit only to the extent that we can share it with the world. The ability to do so comes from working together: Right brain, left brain. Private-public partnership. Interdisciplinary research. And researchers, caregivers, and patients working together toward health, and hope. On behalf of UBC, it is my honour and pleasure to acknowledge Mr. Rudy North for his critical contribution, his foresight, and his careful attention to brain research at UBC over time; the Townsend family for their tremendous generosity, and their longstanding friendship with and support of UBC; and Dr. Djavad Mowafaghian—for his own stroke of insight and for his extraordinary gift to this project and to health, and to hope. You [all] make it easy to believe that right here, right now, we can make the world a better place. Thank you. I now invite my colleague Dr. David Ostrow, President and CEO of Vancouver Coastal Health, to the podium. David ….  
1.0102609~Imagine UBC~Toope, Stephen J.~    Speaking notes Imagine UBC September 8, 2009  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice Chancellor The University of British Columbia         2 Thank you Brian (Sullivan).  Good afternoon! Congratulations! You?ve arrived!  I am so pleased to be here to once again welcome so many of the best and brightest high-school graduates and transfer students from around British Columbia, across Canada, and from 143 countries throughout the world. It gives us great pride to know that you have chosen UBC over so many other institutions that were similarly eager to have you as students.  Welcome to Vancouver, welcome to your new university, and welcome to this brand new facility that in just five months time will be the venue for women?s hockey and sledge hockey during the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games!   3 Today, I want to briefly discuss four different topics ? topics that are perhaps as pertinent to Olympic athletes as they are to new students, and these are: plans? expectations?hopes?and fears.   First, plans. It occurs to me that some of you have come here with well-charted plans in mind for your education, and perhaps also some clear aspirations for your subsequent career. If that is the case, excellent ? well done.  Some of you, on the other hand, may not have charted a course as clearly defined as that, but you certainly have expectations about what you want to learn, experience and achieve during your time here. You too are to be commended, for your foresight, and for taking ownership of your learning experience.  And no doubt there are some of you who are not yet clear on what to expect for your university education, let alone have a plan for how it will unfold and where it will lead you. But at the very least,  4 you have hopes ? hopes that it will be a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience that will help you to identify the next steps you will take in your journey.  If you are in this category, congratulations! In many ways you stand to have a particularly enriching experience, because you are naturally open and receptive to the vast spectrum of intellectual wealth and stimuli you will encounter here.   And finally, some of you have arrived here gripped with fears ? maybe even outright terror!   If you fall into this category, rest assured you?re not alone. In fact, I can assure you that every one of the people with plans, expectations and hopes are also struck with at least some measure of fear. My advice to you is to take a moment to remind yourself of your outstanding success to date, and how your talent and efforts  5 have qualified you for admission into a university that ranks solidly among the top 35 in the world.  At the same time though, it might be a good idea to make as many friends as possible with people in the ?hopes? category. You  might be surprised at how quickly the fear gives way!  But irrespective of which category - or combination thereof - that you fall into, you are all to be congratulated for what you have achieved in the course of your formal education. Your challenge now is to ensure you make the most of this rare and precious opportunity. To that end, I want to make the following recommendations.   First, strive to link your experiences in the classroom, library or lab to the wider world. During orientation, you have already heard about the many opportunities that UBC offers to enrich your  6 learning experience through programs such as Co-op, Work Learn, and Community Service Learning.  Take the time to consider carefully which of these experiential learning opportunities will further enhance your academic experience, and provide you with that additional ?margin of excellence? in the years ahead.  The second recommendation is to make meaningful connections with as many of your fellow students as possible during your time here. In particular, I urge you to resist the temptation to seek the comfort of associating primarily with students from your own home town, or your own academic program, or your own housing unit. The connections you establish with a wider range of students will not only contribute to a greater sense of community on campus, they will also serve you well in the years to follow ? even a lifetime.   7 The third recommendation is to participate in a wide range of activities, and to generously share with your fellow students the precious gifts that each of you bring ? and that is your ideas and your unique understanding.  There can be no doubt that the addition of thousands of new students reflecting the thoughts and experiences of so many of Canada?s best and brightest ? not to mention those of countless cultures from throughout the world - will infinitely enrich the caliber of dialogue that will take place here, and which are among the most essential elements of an education that is truly global in nature.  So having talked about plans, expectations, hopes and fears, I want to introduce a fifth topic, and that is change.  The Irish poet and playwright, William Butler Yeats, once wrote: ?education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.?  8  What Yeats probably intended to symbolize with the phrase ?the lighting of a fire? is the discovery of a passion, or in other words, the process of finding out exactly what it is that truly excites and energizes you.  It also occurs to me that ?the lighting a fire? is most likely to occur when we encounter ? and when we are open and receptive to ? new and compelling ideas, new and profound experiences, and new and intriguing people. In so doing, we open our minds to new curiosity, new interests?and yes, new ambitions.  Even those of you who have well defined plans or clear expectations for your education may be surprised by how those plans and expectations can be affected ? indeed, how they can be changed ? by the new ideas, new experiences and new people that you will encounter here.   9 And so my final recommendation is to not lose sight of your plans, expectations and hopes, but at the same time do not fear change. And above all be open and receptive to the newness that surrounds you here.  Think of this place we call UBC as a place of complete openness ? of openness in all its forms.  A place of physical openness that lends itself equally to vibrant human interaction, and quiet solitary reflection.  A place of international openness ? a hub of global connectivity on the edge of a continent.  And most important of all, a place of intellectual openness ? one that welcomes and inspires diversity, innovation?and change? and from where great things will continue to emerge to affect local communities, and entire populations throughout the world.  10  Before I conclude, I want to show you more precisely what I mean. You are about to be the first-ever audience to view a short video that we have created ? one that is based upon two years of consultation with students, faculty, alumni, and community members.  This video is intended to launch a whole campaign, one that we hope will aid us in telling our UBC story, to explain exactly what it is that has solidified our reputation among the great universities of the world; what it is that empowers us to try anything, to be anything, to carve our own path, and to learn, discover and contribute in our own way.  At the end, I will have a small task for you, so those of you who are carrying cell phones, please have them ready. Lights dim ? video rolls Resume text while lights remain dim  11  UBC is a unique place, a Place of Mind. I challenge you to think about what this means to you, and to think about what you can achieve?From Here.  Those of you with cell phones are about to be linked to a new community site, powered by you. Please share it widely with fellow students. It's a place to learn, discover, contribute, comment and get involved.  (pause)  Add your voice. Volunteer. Tackle the big issues. Challenge your peers to do the same.  You have arrived at a place where open thought, open expression, and open minds to new ideas can change the world?and indeed, already have.  12  What will you do here at this Place of Mind?  Where will you go From Here?  (pause)  Have a fabulous week, and good luck to you all!   
1.0102595~Imagine UBC pep rally~Toope, Stephen J.~Page 1 of 6  Imagine UBC Pep Rally September 4, 2012 Professor Stephen Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  How many people would say that they are having a great first day at UBC?  How many think that they have chosen the best university in Canada?  How many think their faculty or program is better than any other?  Well I am glad you feel that way, and I think you are in for many wonderful experiences during your time here. But in order for that to occur, you?re going to have to put your imaginations to work.  Imagine truly is a perfect theme for a day like this. I hope that the word itself is an inspiring call to action. The other reason I like Imagine as a theme is that its meaning in the context of this day is appropriately subject to interpretation.  The way I see it, to imagine?is to be original.  Imagine UBC Vancouver 4 September 2012 Page 2 of 6  With that interpretation as a premise, I want to share some simple ideas concerning the importance of originality, of becoming a skilled and independent free thinker, which many contend is the single most important objective of an undergraduate university experience.  Sounds simple enough, but finding originality and thinking for yourself is a process. It?s a process that begins with a willingness to be open-minded to varying points of view, followed by a careful analysis of the evidence offered in support of each one.  The final step in the process is to draw your own conclusions based on what you have determined to be the most compelling evidence to support your views. It?s the opposite of sub-consciously conforming to ?conventional wisdom? or popular opinion.  If at some point you study American literature, you may come across the writing of the 19th century transcendentalist philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Imagine UBC Vancouver 4 September 2012 Page 3 of 6  In a famous essay appropriately titled, On Self Reliance, Emerson implores the reader to resist conformity with the words: ?Insist on yourself; never imitate.? But even if you don?t ever read Emerson, chances are a parent or a relative has already offered the same advice in similarly blunt terms.  ?Be a leader, not a sheep.?  ?You came into this world an original; don?t leave it a copy.?  Now I?ll admit that remaining an original can perhaps be challenging in an era in which pop culture is pervasive. Everywhere we go we are reminded of a world seemingly bent on conformity ? conformity to clothing styles, conformity to a narrow range of popular music, or to certain verbal expressions.  As an example, consider the drastic overuse - and misuse - of the word, ?awesome.? There was a time when it was a highly useful and expressive term, one selectively used only to describe things that elicited slack-jawed amazement. Sadly, its meaning has become Imagine UBC Vancouver 4 September 2012 Page 4 of 6  distorted. It?s fallen victim to sub-conscious conformity - the antithesis of free-thinking originality.  So here?s an idea. Whenever you hear the word casually used to describe things that aren?t even vaguely ?awesome,? let that be a reminder to you about how one of your principle objectives during your time here is to strive for originality ? originality in your thoughts and in the manner in which you express them.  I have three recommendations for how you can refine these skills.  The first is to leave your comfort zone. Seek the discomfort of new experiences.  You?ll never have a better opportunity to try things you?ve never done before than here at UBC. Take a course in an unfamiliar subject; try a new sport; volunteer for a new cause; consider community or international service learning opportunities; sign up for co-op or mentorship programs; join a campus club, or explore the fine arts. The possibilities are infinite.  Imagine UBC Vancouver 4 September 2012 Page 5 of 6  The second recommendation is to interact with the widest possible range of people, and do it in a direct and respectful give-and-take manner. Facebook is a wonderful tool, but it can never be a substitute for face-to-face engagement. For that matter, consider more talking and less texting. Become friends with somebody from a completely different country and culture than your own. Resist the natural urge to associate primarily with people from your home town, from your program or from your residence.  You may not know it, but in many cases the connections you make in the days ahead will become important lifelong relationships, so ensure that your network is large and diverse.  Third, and I cannot emphasize this enough; strive to become an effective communicator.  Remember that one of the essential aspects of being an original and skilled independent thinker is the ability to articulately express both your thoughts and the rationale that supports your views. Not only that, but learning to communicate effectively in both written and verbal Imagine UBC Vancouver 4 September 2012 Page 6 of 6  exchanges will be of paramount importance in every future endeavour you undertake ? personal and professional.  Finally, a solemn assurance: at UBC, undergraduate students matter.  Your success and fulfillment matters to me personally. It matters to your professors personally, and it matters personally to the staff members and student volunteers who have arranged this wonderful day called Imagine.  With that in mind, I sincerely hope that you take advantage of the many rich opportunities before you, and that you will consider these recommendations to seek new experiences, to open your minds to diverse perspectives, to hone your communication skills and?  To imagine?and to remain?an original.  Best wishes to you all, and welcome to UBC! It?s awesome! 
1.0102607~UBC Student Leadership Conference~Toope, Stephen J.~Page 1 of 4  UBC Student Leadership Conference  January 12, 2013 Professor Stephen J. Toope  Good morning. A warm welcome to all of you. And what a wonderful sight it is to see so much energy in one place. And on a Saturday morning no less. Clearly born leaders all of you. ?Unwritten: Creating your own story.? Once again the organizers have selected a great theme to stimulate engagement.  And since storytelling is the medium of the day, I have a short story I would like to share. It?s the story of a high school student ? we?ll call him Charlie ? whose extended family gets together annually to celebrate the holiday season. On this particular year, it was Charlie?s family?s turn to be hosts of the holiday feast and to welcome a handful of relatives as overnight guests. Among them was Charlie?s grandmother, who presented him with a jigsaw puzzle of a map of Paris. There were a thousand pieces, all similarly shaped with few distinguishing features. Hundreds of the pieces were all the same pale blue color with only the word ?Rue,? the French word for street, appearing either in whole or in part. This will be a very challenging puzzle he thought, and secretly wondered if he would have the patience to assemble it. But early in the afternoon, he opened the box and positioned the box top with the map of Paris on the living room coffee table. He then did what most puzzlers do; he began looking for the edge pieces. Soon his younger cousin sat beside him on the sofa and began to run her fingers through the pieces, eventually finding an edge piece that clicked into place, and then another. Next, an uncle who never spoke much began to hover nearby. Eventually he too spotted an edge piece, and then another.   UBC Student Leadership Conference    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 2 of 4  Page 2 of 4  Through the course of the afternoon, several people took turns searching through the pieces, studying the box top carefully and every so often finding a fit. The puzzlers worked into the night, but it took another two full days to finish it. Once completed, it was a rather intriguing thing to look at, with Paris? most famous museums, monuments and boulevards all highlighted. Best of all, it had been a fun and satisfying exercise, and one that had nicely integrated several people who otherwise may not have interacted as much. Several weeks later, Charlie?s family received a late-night telephone call from a hospital admitting clerk who said that his grandmother had been brought by ambulance and was in intensive care. Although the elderly lady survived, her ordeal resulted in the family spending many long hours in a room reserved for the families of intensive care patients. At one point Charlie noticed a shelf upon which were boxes of puzzles. With little to do between limited visits to the ICU, he chose another one-thousand piece puzzle. The box top depicted a striking and colourful scene of an outdoor Asian market. Shortly after he put the first edge pieces into place, the phenomenon of people joining in repeated itself. Charlie?s grandmother was one of several intensive care patients, and the family room was frequented by many diverse people who came and went at all hours. Charlie was quietly amazed to see how even severely troubled people from all manner of ethnicity and backgrounds ? complete strangers to one another - were irresistibly drawn together to re-create the colourful images on the box top. In later years, Charlie studied computer engineering and went to work for a large telecommunications company. One of the things that appealed to him about his job was that the company?s chief executive officer was a masterful story teller who used his skills and passion to share the company?s business strategy in a highly motivational manner. Knowing exactly what the company was attempting to achieve, Charlie and his colleagues could easily identify how they could contribute, and they did so with   UBC Student Leadership Conference    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4  Page 3 of 4  great gusto. He was soon promoted to manager, and then a director. A few years later, he started his own successful company. One day a student intern asked Charlie what advice he would give on being a good leader. Charlie thought for a moment about how the CEO of his previous company was so effective in telling his people about their company?s strategy, and in a way that made them excited to be a part of it. But then he remembered the puzzles and the groups of people who couldn?t resist helping to put them together. It suddenly occurred to him that what piqued their interest so profoundly was the box top! The box top included a vivid picture of the desired outcome of collective efforts, detailed instructions on how to achieve objectives, and a constant feedback mechanism to show progress and challenges. And suddenly it occurred to him that by sharing the company?s strategy so openly and passionately with his employees, the CEO had, in effect, merely shared the box top of an intriguing jigsaw puzzle. Charlie quickly decided to change his story. ?Leadership,? he told the intern, ?is like a jigsaw puzzle. As long as the puzzle you?ve chosen is of a captivating scene and you keep the box top on display for all to see you?ll be amazed by how many people will want to help put it together. They?ll be able to see exactly how they can contribute and how much progress they have made. If on the other hand, you give them the pieces, but not the box top, they?ll soon lose interest or be discouraged.? The puzzle analogy sounds simple, doesn?t it? Devise an outcome and a strategy for whatever it is you want to achieve tell it to your group members in an understandable way and watch them go to work. Well, yes, but not exactly.  First, you?ve got to create a story about something you are truly passionate about, something that you can?t stop thinking about. At the same time though, it is   UBC Student Leadership Conference    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 4 of 4  Page 4 of 4  essential to recognize that although the idea is alive in your head, it is still ?unwritten.? Therefore, you need to write it, draw it, express it as articulately as possible.  Then put it on a box top so that others can see the end result you have in mind, and the strategy you have devised to achieve it.  Next, ensure that you have a means of reporting on progress and challenges so that everybody knows exactly where they are relative to the end results they are trying to achieve. In order to do that you must keep the box top in full view at all times.  Leaders who don?t share strategic objectives, progress and challenges are akin to puzzlers who leave the room with the box top. The others involved in the exercise have a much more difficult time contributing, and they will be challenged to remember what it is they are working towards. The moral of the story is simply this: Never assume that just because you have an idea for something you want to create or change in this world that other people will see it as clearly and with the same passion and ambition that you do. Whatever story you create, make it your own. And then turn it into the most striking, colourful and captivating image you possibly can and put it on a box top. And leave it in a place where all can see. I want to conclude by commending you all on your decision to participate in this conference. I assure you that you are all in for a fabulous day. On behalf of UBC, my sincere thanks to all of the organizers and presenters. Best wishes to all. Thank you. 
1.0102618~Timber + touchpads : how education will make or break BC’s emerging smart economy~Toope, Stephen J.~      Timber + TouchPads: How Education Will Make or Break BC?s Emerging Smart Economy Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Keynote Address September 13, 2012 ? 12:00 ? 1:45 PM The Fairmont Pacific Rim, Star Sapphire Ballroom 1038 Canada Place   Presenting sponsor: HSBC Supporting sponsors: Odgers Berndtson, Sauder School of Business Media Partner: Business in Vancouver  Thank you, Mike.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Board of Trade, guests, sponsors, and partners: I?m excited to be here with you again. In fact, it?s an exciting time to be alive, isn?t it? The crisp fall air, the rituals of getting back to school and down to business, the heightened energy that election time brings, both here and across the border, a clean slate for the Canucks, a successful Olympic Games?and the satisfaction of knowing ours were even better!?the discovery of the Higgs bosun, Vogue Magazine showing colour blocking again for a second year, and of course ? it?s almost harvest time.        Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 2 Remember harvest time? Who here has a memory about harvest time they?d like to share? No one? I didn?t think so. Me neither. You and I share the curious distinction of being among the first human cohort on the planet who do not know how to grow our own food. For whom the meal we just enjoyed may as well have originated magically in the Fairmont kitchen. In the space of a single generation, the majority of us have managed to lose our elemental link to the soil, a link that for thousands of years was the basis of our survival.  There?s a renaissance happening in western culture right now among people who are waking up to the link between the health of the soil and human health and survival. Right here at home, Business in Vancouver founder Peter Ladner has turned his considerable energies and attention to local food production and security. And a man who once made his living as a farmer is now Vancouver?s mayor. UBC?s farm is now part of a city-wide collective of farmers? markets. The BC government just announced $2 million dollars in funding for local food-based businesses and organizations to increase their accessibility to BC citizens. Our ability to feed ourselves?sustainably?is a bigger business issue, a bigger political issue now than at any other time in human history.       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 3  The question I want to put to you today is, What is the parallel economic issue? Where, economically, do we need to shore up our ability to feed ourselves? To sustain ourselves? You had a speaker here last week talking about how it could be the mining sector. And it?s true, Canada?s mining industry is assuming a leading role on the world stage. But KPMG recently released their Technology Report Card, and it showed how BC?s technology sector is at a turning point, how realizing its full potential will require ?a heightened level of intention in terms of [both] policy and industry development.? So which is it, resources or technology? Timber or touchpads? Where do we place our focus? Our energies? Our dollars?  I?m a minister?s son. I grew up listening to parables about the land. It wasn?t so long ago that we all did, all over the planet, regardless of race or creed, because we understood the land, and stories about the land helped us understand everything else. I began by speaking about food and land because in addition to its literal power in our society right now, it also serves as a parallel for the ideas I want to share with you today.       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 4  In my modern parable, the farmer?s field symbolizes the BC economy. Each crop growing in the field is one of the province?s economic sectors: mining, forestry, fisheries, textiles, technology, retail, and so on, each one side by side with the others. The farmer represents all of us?government, non-profit, and business leaders, as well as ordinary citizens?everyone who?s responsible for tending the crops, and who has a stake in the farm?s harvest.  Now: Where in this bucolic picture does education belong? Education is simply another one of the sectors, or crops, competing for the farmer?s time, attention, and resources ? isn?t it? Or is it?  Over the next few minutes, I?m going to share with you some ideas, a few thought-provoking statistics, and a vision of how BC could be about to step into a groundbreaking role on the world economic stage. But if you take away only one thing from today, let it be this: in this parable?in the ?big picture??BC?s post-secondary education system is the soil. It is not one more competitor in the fight for government       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 5 resources or corporate investment. It is the ground out of which everything else grows. It?s the soil.  I can just see the headlines tomorrow: UBC President Plays Dirty With Vancouver Business Leaders. ?  Let?s look at ?super, natural? British Columbia for a moment. By almost any measure, one of the most favoured and desirable places on earth. Awe-inspiring in the beauty and diversity of its landscape, blessed by an abundance of energy and natural resources, relatively strong in its economy even as economies elsewhere are struggling, cosmopolitan in its communities, a world leader in research, socially open and safe, globally connected, intellectually rich, innovative, creative, and enterprising. It?s easy to love ? and it?s so easy to take it all for granted.  Post-secondary education in British Columbia is a part of this landscape that many people do take for granted. And yet, our system is unmatched anywhere else in North America and, arguably, the       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 6 world. It has been a primary catalyst for BC?s prosperity, and right now, whatever your occupation, location, or name of your political party, this unique education system is the key to our collective future. Education touches every business, every community, every organization, and every issue in our province. Its influence reaches to every person at every age in their lives. Like never before, it has the capacity to make or break the business climate in British Columbia. At a time when there is a tendency to fight over limited resources, it supersedes special interests and points toward a way of fulfilling all public policy issues. There is a purpose here I believe all of us can share.  In past years, I?ve used my time here to promote UBC and the ways the university and business communities can work together. But I?m not here for UBC today. I?m not here to make a competing claim for your attention, or your investment. I?m here on behalf of post-secondary education in BC as a whole, that unparalleled system that puts this province on the cusp of an economic breakthrough at this particular moment in time. And I?m here to ask how we might all invest in that system.        Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 7 So, why here? Why now?  First question, why British Columbia? My answer to that is short, but it?s crucial. We?ve been lucky in our leadership. Successive BC governments since the mid-20th century have grasped the imperative link between education and the economy. They?ve invested, one, and two, they?ve allowed the system to develop in an unusually fluid way. What this means to British Columbians is that they can chart their own individual learning pathway, and that pathway can travel in all directions, from community college to an advanced degree, from research university to vocational training, and back, anywhere in the province. British Columbians don?t have to decide once and for all whether to go to university OR do something else. BC has created a landscape with a scope of choices that reflects our citizens? diverse needs and interests, and that supports a lifetime of learning.  What does that look like in concrete terms? Six research universities, one among the top 25 in the world, two others among the best in Canada, one the best of its size in the West. Together we attract about 700 million dollars each year in non-provincial research funding into       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 8 BC, and have a combined economic impact of $16 billion annually. A province-wide, distributed medical training program that addresses the health care needs of citizens throughout the province, and is attracting international interest in its training methods. And what else? Technical institutes, regional colleges, teaching universities, and more. We number 25 institutions in all, each one distinct, each serving a local community as well as the province as a whole, and woven together into an integrated whole that is without compare.  And now. Why now? Again, the answer?s simple. But this one takes a little more time to explain, and a few numbers. Like this one:  According to the June OECD report, in the past 10 years, Canada?s productivity has fallen to the point that we rank 17th in the world and our national standard of living is at risk. You may have read as much in BCIT president Don Wright?s op-ed in The Vancouver Sun. Within Canada, BC ranks sixth for productivity. BC also lags behind in Canada for participation rates in post-secondary education. Coincidence? Maybe ? Let?s reserve judgment until we look a little further.        Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 9 Another number: The BC Labour Market model projects a million new job openings between 2010 and 2020. What percentage of those will require some kind of post-secondary education? Seventy-eight percent, or 780,000 of BC?s new job openings will need post-secondary grads to fill them: 35 percent with university degrees, 28 percent with college credentials, and 15 percent with a trades certificate.  New immigrants are expected to fill one third of those one million job openings. But net immigration levels have dropped by over 50 percent since 2008. All right, well, let?s not panic yet. Traditionally, we?ve been able to count on a steady increase in the number of people of working age to drive growth. Oh, but the number of people in the 18-to-24 age group is forecast to decline until 2022, and the boomers? retirement exodus has most definitely begun.  We?re still not too worried, though. All we have to do is make sure that the percentage of people graduating from high school and transitioning into post-secondary education will increase, so we can fill those 780,000 jobs and get our productivity turned around. Right now, that transition number stands at 53 percent straight from grade 12, and 72       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 10 percent within five years. So we know we need more students making the leap to post-secondary education, and making it sooner.  And let?s look for a moment at what we know about post-secondary graduates. University grads specifically have been more successful at remaining employed during the recent economic downturn. In fact, employment rates with any post-secondary qualifications are consistently higher than with a high school diploma only. A Bachelor?s degree earns that grad $27,000 a year more than a high school grad, and a Master?s degree adds another $10,000 to that. Research shows that a graduate student at any level has a higher income and higher employment rate, better health, increased voter participation, and better educated children than the national average. Graduate students have been shown to be key to improving competitiveness and productivity by taking new knowledge and approaches from universities into industry.  And then there?s this: whether it?s a doctoral degree or a trades certificate, increasing the national average educational attainment       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 11 level by just one year increases aggregate productivity by 6.2 percent on impact and a further 3.1 percent in the long term.   So to summarize: productivity?s down and our standard of living is at risk. A million new jobs will open up by 2020, but we don?t have the immigration numbers or the domestic numbers to fill them. And even if we did, 780,000 of those jobs will require post-secondary training, the kind of training necessary to jumpstart our productivity, but we don?t have enough young people going into post-secondary education to close the gap.  What do we do? Well, the answer seems obvious: we get more students into the BC post-secondary system?that exceptional, unrivaled system we looked at earlier. [pause]  Camosun College, College of the Rockies, Langara College, Okanagan College, BCIT, the Justice Institute, Capilano University, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, University of the Fraser Valley, Royal Roads University, University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, and       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 12 the University of British Columbia are all exceeding 100 percent of the available funded domestic student space. These institutions account for 71 percent of the total funded post-secondary capacity. The research universities have been over capacity for the past six years. Most of the remaining institutions would be challenged to absorb additional students without new funding from the province?funding which subsidizes the cost of education.  I will note, and you may have heard, that the Province has an International Education Strategy to increase the number of international students accepted to BC universities as they help make our education system globally relevant, and provide richer social, cultural and economic experiences.  These students are not included in the provincially funded student spaces.  In fact, the number of funded student spaces in BC has been effectively frozen since fiscal 2009/2010, and according to BC?s current fiscal plan, will remain frozen to 2014/15. The answer to our conundrum is to increase participation in the post-secondary system, but our institutions are at or beyond capacity. We would need 3,200 new student spaces for every one percent increase in post-secondary participation, but funding for new spaces has been frozen and is projected to be frozen for another three years.       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 13  So ? it only makes sense that the number of credentials per population in BC has been falling. Amongst Canadian provinces, BC ranks eighth in undergraduate degrees per thousand people and fourth in graduate degrees.  In fact, we?d need to increase our undergraduate degree-granting capacity by nearly forty percent to catch up to Ontario and Quebec. How many new student spaces would that require? Thirty-two thousand, maybe more. We?re behind the Canadian average in graduating students from technology-related programs such as engineering, computer and information sciences, physical and life sciences, and mathematics. We?re also below average in granting degrees in health programs.  We?ve looked at the role graduate students play in knowledge transfer and increasing innovation and productivity. BC has had 2,500 graduate student spaces added between 2007 and 2010, but there are no plans for more. Over that same time period, Ontario added 15,300 spaces and will add another 6,000 between now and 2017. And let?s not even talk about the numbers of grad students coming out of China. To keep pace just with Ontario, BC would need another 5,000 graduate student spaces.        Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 14  So. We know what the problem is, and we?re lucky, we know what the solution is, too. That leaves us with just two questions: One, how do we do it? And two ? will we?  Throughout 2012, the leaders of BC?s post-secondary institutions have been meeting to try to find a way forward.  We?ve come to understand that, as a community, British Columbians must ensure three things: that there is a space in our post-secondary education system for every one of us who?s qualified. And then we have to make sure that every qualified student is able to study, regardless of financial circumstances. Lastly, we have to make a commitment to stable funding for research and innovation initiatives that position BC as a national leader.   I do understand that for some of you listening to me today, some of these facts and figures may be unfamiliar. Please, don?t let that lull you into thinking this isn?t your issue, that you don?t have a crucial stake in this debate. The outcome of this issue will lay the       Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 15 groundwork?prepare the soil?for business and the economy in British Columbia for decades to come.  I look around the world and see micro-economies that are thriving beyond all expectations and in spite of a global economy that continues to fumble for its footing. Taiwan?s technology hub in Taipei City. East London Tech City. Korea?s Daedeok Innopolis ecosystem. Japan?s Tsukuba Science Town. And closer to home, Penn State?s Center for Enterprise Architecture, and San Diego?s thriving high tech hub. Every one of them is succeeding in large part because of the foundation laid by its post-secondary education system. And not one of those systems is as fluid or multi-functional as ours. Can you begin to imagine what more is possible here in ?super, natural? British Columbia if we?re willing to invest?  Right now, we?re enjoying a harvest created by past investments in education and research. But we?re coming to understand that the same soil can?t produce this bounty year after year without renewal.         Vancouver Board of Trade 2012   Stephen J. Toope   Page 16 My colleagues and I are working within our own institutions and as a collective to ensure these issues are addressed. But we need BC?s business leaders to work with us to ensure that you get the skilled people and leading-edge ideas that will help you increase innovation, productivity, and success. Expect to hear more from us over the next few weeks as we reach out with a clear game plan to the Board of Trade, the business community as a whole, and to you as leaders of that community.  Because now is the time to make wise use and extract full value from our rich natural resources. Now is the time to expand and diversify our economy through knowledge-based innovation. Now is the time to capitalize on the new knowledge emerging from our universities. Now is the time to equip all British Columbians to thrive. A space for every qualified learner.  The means to learn, regardless of financial circumstances.   And a commitment to stable funding for research and innovation. Here.  Now.  Thank you.  -30- 
1.0107466~Educating the eye : engendering issues of social justice at UBC and beyond. Celebrating women’s and gender studies research at UBC~Toope, Stephen J.~EDUCATING THE EYE: Engendering Issues of Social Justice at UBC and Beyond Celebrating Women’s and Gender Studies Research at UBC  Friday 2 November 2007 1:30 – 6:00 p.m.  St. John’s College Social Room  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 1  Thank you, Dr. Creese [Gillian], for your kind introduction, and thanks to all of you for your invitation to present the keynote address at this conference today. It’s an honour and a pleasure to be here, to celebrate the successes of the Women’s and Gender Studies Program and Centre with you, and to share this opportunity to hear some of the leading research that has been conducted here on engendering issues of social justice.  I was asked to talk today about some of my own experiences and my work in law and human rights, and I also want to talk about what it is we’re celebrating: about all that it means for this program and this Centre, for the University of British Columbia as a globally influential institution, and for the local, national and international communities beyond our gates, that Women’s and Gender Studies is celebrating 35 years of teaching and learning, research and collaboration, and success in driving and supporting social change.  But before I go any further, I just want to say that I really hope I look the part of a keynote speaker today. I’m recently back from Japan,  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 2  and I haven’t been able to see my barber. None the wiser I went for a “dressed” look, but not too formal, so I’m feeling reasonably confident, for the most part. But you know, what I’m concerned about is the eye glasses.  It’s silly, really. It was over a year ago now. I was interviewed for a local online publication, and the reporter opened his story by referring to these glasses and saying that I looked like “an amiable, quizzical opossum” such as might be found in a British children’s story book.  In other words, in the three to 10 seconds in which we apparently make most of our decisions about the people we meet, he decided that I most certainly did not look like a university President. Or maybe it was that I didn’t much resemble Martha Piper, who broke the mold after 11 consecutive male presidents and whose image became synonymous with “university president” during her tenure.  Whatever the case, this journalist did acknowledge my past credentials and so was prepared to give me a chance to show what I could do. And I tell you this silly opossum story for this reason: that I  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 3  was grateful, because that second chance is more than most people get once they’re seen as less than, or other than, human.  In an essay called “Seeing,” in the book Bread Out of Stone, Torontobased, Trinidadian essayist and poet Dionne Brand says, “The eye is a curious thing: it is not passive, not merely a piece of physiology, practical and utilitarian. The eye has experience, knowledge and has cut out territories, reasons why it sees this subject leaning in and that one leaning away. The eye has citizenship and possessions. The eye [possesses] frames … describing the edges of the picture and what must be at the focus. The eye has purpose and goes where it wants to in order to clarify itself. Or to repeat. Or to regulate. It is very precise as to how it wants to see the world. This is the eye that always looks and needs to be looked at. You cannot leave this eye alone for a second, at least not if it’s resting on you. It will fall back on itself, on things it knows.”1  What we’re celebrating here today is that for 35 years, Women’s and Gender Studies at UBC has not left this eye alone for a second. This  1  D. Brand, “Seeing,” (1994) Bread Out of Stone at 169-171.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 4  eye that sees through its own experiences, its own territories, its own citizenship, to the exclusion—and often the attempted destruction—of all else.  You have said to this eye, ‘Open wider and see these experiences; explore this territory; acknowledge these citizens.’  You have said, ‘Make room. In yourself, in your frame of reference, in your too-small, exclusive world.’ What’s more, you have made room, here, a safe place of inquiry and reflection where heretical questions may be asked, prevailing viewpoints challenged, revolutionary new viewpoints raised, the invisible and the disappeared brought to light and included.  And you have not kept it guarded as ‘a room of your own,’ but opened your doors wide—to the university, through an astonishing range of interdisciplinary initiatives and partnerships; to the local community, through both student placements in community organizations and research opportunities for community-based scholars; and to the  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 5  international community, through your Visiting Scholars Program and your graduate studies programs.  This conference is not only a celebration of all you’ve accomplished but also an invitation to a broader audience on the UBC campus to consider the gender dimensions of social justice issues in relation to their own work. Perhaps even to see ways in which more of us might work together to advance these issues, where working separately would take us so much longer.  A milestone like this invites us all to ask: How far have we come? Where are we now? And, What are our next steps? I’d like to speak to those questions a little now within the context of my own profession and field of study, that of law.  Under the law, women could not vote in this country until 1918, and they could not stand for election until 1920. Women were not, in fact, considered persons here in Canada until 1929. Finally, in 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was incorporated into our constitution, declaring that “Every individual is equal before and under  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 6  the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination. Further, “notwithstanding anything in [the] Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to in it [were] guaranteed equally to male and female persons.”2  That was 1982, and there was a lot of hope brought to bear on those words and that document. But it was understood that it was not a reality that was being enshrined in our Constitution then, but an ideal toward which we then had to work. And so here’s a little story about something else that happened in 1982.  In 1982, I was in third-year law school at McGill. Throughout my time in law school I studied in a small group with three other people, all of whom were women. Two of those women were older than the standard student age, and had come back to study law after raising families and, in one case, after another career. The four of us worked very closely together, and when the mooting exercises took place, we chose our mooting partners from within that close-knit group. In a moot, you get up and pretend you’re arguing a case in front of a  2  From Sections 15 and 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 7  court, and usually you have real judges, or practicing lawyers from the legal community who come in and serve as judges.  So in my moot, I worked with one of the women in that group as my partner—someone with whom I remain close friends—and the other two women were partners together. Their opponents were two young men who were both clearly very ambitious and driven toward success as practicing lawyers. And they had as their judges two practitioners and one upper-year student.  So the way this works is, you’re in a team of two, you’re arguing a case as if you’re arguing before an appellate court, and you have people on the other side arguing against you. So my female colleagues stood up and they argued their case, and then the other side, the two young men, argued their case, and then it came time for the practitioners who were serving as judges to give their critique.  They started with my two friends, and said quite complimentary things, for instance, you argued this very well, you were very clear about that, I think you need to work more on X, Y, or Z. And they  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 8  finished their critique. And then they turned their attention to the other two, young, male law students, both of whom were very clean-cut and outfitted in blue suits, etc. And the judges looked at them and said, “You two really looked like lawyers.”  I was watching this, and I remember that my heart just stopped. I thought, ‘That is impossible in our era’ when, by that time, the majority of law students were women, and had been for some time.  Another story: The third woman in our group, my mooting partner, graduated and went off to work in Toronto. She’s a very smart person, very capable, and has had a very successful career. I must also add that she is a stylish dresser. Her first day on the job with a very distinguished Toronto law firm, she was called into the office of her mentor, a longtime, senior lawyer who had been assigned to help her navigate the ways of the firm. He said to her, ‘I don’t know how everything’s going for you today, but I can tell you that you should never wear a green suit to work.’  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 9  Now, I know the suit that she was wearing and it was absolutely stunningly beautiful—green linen, not flashy, just very elegant. But the point was that she was supposed to turn herself into someone who looked like a lawyer, and that meant looking like the men, and that meant a dark-blue suit.  That was 1982, the year of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and in this, the 25th anniversary year of those words about equality and the guarantee of rights, I can think of so many friends and colleagues who are constantly being challenged by these kinds of things, even still. So, how far have we come? Well, yes, we’ve made some progress, but we haven’t made as much as we like to think.  A few years ago, I wrote an article titled “Riding the Fences: Courts, Charter Rights and Family Law,” which was published in 1991 in the Canadian Journal of Family Law.3 By that time—nine years from its introduction into the Canadian legal landscape—I expected that the Charter would have made a significant difference to family law in Canada, but what I found was that it had not. So I decided to look at 3  Stephen J. Toope, “Riding the Fences: Courts, Charter Rights and Family Law” (1991) Canadian Journal of Family Law at 55-77. Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 10  why that was. And the answers I found lay in certain assumptions about rights, family and privacy that were inherently gendered.  Within families, as in so many other contexts in Canadian life, the Charter had changed the way people were talking to each other, leading them into clashing assertions of “rights.”  Yet within families, the locus of power and challenges to that power had traditionally been shielded from public view, whereas it is in public that “rights” are usually articulated.  Until the late 1980s, the traditional, unchallenged presumption was that the family was a “private” sphere of activity, clearly distinguishable from the “public” life of the workplace and the marketplace.  So in the courts, judges searched for ways to protect the “sanctity” of the family while adjudicating upon the “best interests” of those in broken family relationships, especially children. In these cases, children had rights; parents had responsibilities. Beyond that, it was  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 11  the judicial and doctrinal argument that constitutional rights could not be invoked in private disputes, family disagreements being quintessentially private.  Moreover, according to the courts, the Charter was designed to protect individuals from overweening state power—not from other individuals. Thus, to invoke a Charter right, it was necessary to show some form of governmental action. In other words, the government was subject to Charter review even though other sources of oppression remained constitutionally free to oppress. Lastly, the Charter may actually be interpreted to include a protection for family privacy. Again, the sanctity of the family.  Many voices have decried the privatization of violence against women and children that has been allowed to flourish in the name of the sanctity of the family. Rather than serving as a “haven in a heartless world,” the family has been for many women and children (and sometimes for men) the very site of their oppression.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 12  The fact is, despite the supposed distinction between the public world of law and the private world of the family, the state has always been intimately involved in the construction of the family as we know it, for example, by support of patriarchal structure through law. “Private,” albeit socially constructed, patriarchal power continues to be a source of deep oppression for women. If the Charter is interpreted to focus only upon express governmental acts, it fails to address some of the greatest threats to rights and freedoms that exist in our society.  Yes, families and not the state, should remain the primary locus for decisions relating to sexual expression, the education of children, and the distribution of tasks inside the home, to name but a few examples.  And yes, families are also remarkably complex constructions, not of strictly autonomous entities but of real human beings with needs for independence as well as needs for dependence and for support. The protection of privacy is a necessary element in the creation and the recreation of healthy family relationships.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 13  But it should be possible to evaluate the context of any particular relationship and its effects in deciding to what degree the relationship should be shielded from public scrutiny. Destructive, permanently unequal, or violent relationships should not be immune from public regulation.  What I concluded was that if the rights talk of the Charter is to mean anything in the context of family law, it must be reinterpreted within a subtle and contextual appreciation of relationships. Creative theorists have demonstrated that a reconceptualization of “rights” is possible, and would allow the assertion of rights to make sense within relationships of intimacy and care. But Canadian courts have not yet demonstrated such a degree of philosophical sophistication. As long as rights are viewed solely as fences that the courts must ride to negotiate the barrier between the individual and her society, rights will seem foreign to the private sphere of the family. Our judiciary must look beyond the metaphor of autonomous individuals drawing lines in the sand before the state, and elaborate a new vision.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 14  Someone who, in my view, has been tireless in asking the legal profession and the law itself to expand its vision beyond entrenched frames of reference is Dr. Martha Minow of Harvard Law School.  Dr. Minow is the author of over 150 other books and articles. She has been the Research Chair of “Imagine Coexistence” for the UN High Commission for Refugees, and helps to develop teaching materials on human rights and genocide for use in the US, Europe, and Africa. Her research interests include treatment of recent immigrants in Western democracies, especially around where domestic family law and education practices collide with preferences and practices of new immigrants.  In a book called Making All the Difference: Inclusion, Exclusion, and American Law,4 Dr. Minow talks about how we see—and don’t see— one another through lenses of “difference,” and how five assumptions in particular tend to predetermine our perceptions:  4  Minow, Martha L. Making All the Difference: Inclusion, Exclusion, and American Law. Cornell University Press (1990) at 50-78. Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 15  First, we assume that differences are “intrinsic,” that behaviours or characteristics we see in another that differ from our own identify or define that other person.  Second, we assume that “the norm need not be stated.” That a certain behaviour or characteristic always has one particular meaning, and that that meaning is the norm.  Third, we assume that “the observer can see without a perspective.” That you or I or the schoolteacher or the Supreme Court judge sees all there is to be seen.  Fourth, we assume that “other perspectives are irrelevant.” That there is no context, or are no other perceptions, that need to be accounted for, no other story than the one in which everyone but me is a secondary player.  And fifth, we assume that the “status quo is natural, uncoerced, and good.” That things are the way they are because they are meant to be that way, or because God ordained them to be that way, or  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 16  because the State has declared them to be that way for the good of the people.  From 2000 to 2005, I served as chair of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, which investigates cases linked to the activities of state security agencies. These are cases in which the supposed “differences” of the people in question—political, ideological, religious—are seen as so threatening to the prevailing regime that those people are made to disappear.  I was also the independent fact-finder appointed by the Maher Arar inquiry. Just to remind you, Maher Arar is a Syrian-born male, and a Canadian citizen since 1991. He had been visiting relatives in Tunisia in 2002 when he was detained in New York by US Immigration authorities, held on suspicions of terrorism, and then deported to Syria. For a time, he simply disappeared. My report brought to light clear evidence of Mr. Arar’s severe physical and psychological trauma as a result of having been beaten and tortured there, and his economic ruin as the result of his ordeal. Here, though, is an interesting point: it was being seen—in other words, the fact that the  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 17  report corroborated Mr. Arar’s own story—that he says allowed him to begin his process of social rehabilitation.  A success story? In many regards, absolutely. And yet it can difficult to celebrate sometimes in the face of all that remains to be done.  It can be difficult to celebrate, but I think it’s necessary to do as we are doing here today, to stop and say ‘Yes, we have learned, we have won some victories, we have opened some eyes.’  I want to say within the context of such a celebration as this that we as academics should not be afraid of deep moral commitments in our academic work. There’s nothing wrong with saying that our academic work—in women’s and gender studies, in law, in human rights, in science, in education—actually may serve the promotion of social justice. There’s nothing there that should be seen to undermine the academic credibility of our work. The university experience should be a transformative experience—for students, for faculty, for those we touch beyond these gates. We are in the business of opening eyes, opening minds, dare I say opening hearts. And the only way to  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 18  accomplish that is from a place in ourselves of clear-sightedness, open-mindedness and open-hearted engagement.  There has been much criticism, I think, of women’s studies, race studies, and a whole series of fields, by some people in society who would argue that as academics we are required somehow to be neutral observers. I would agree that there certainly are places for neutral observation and information gathering and data analysis. But there are also places for people within the university to work from a deeply engaged perspective.  One of those places where that is happening at a profound level, is here—in Women’s and Gender Studies Research.  UBC will celebrate the 35th anniversary of teaching feminist courses on campus this coming spring. Firstly, my congratulations on that significant milestone, and secondly, my thanks for creating opportunities like this conference for students and Faculty and for the campus community as a whole to celebrate the successes and achievements of the past 35 years. And there are many.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 19  One of the first schools in North America to offer credit courses in women’s and gender studies, and one of only three schools in Canada now offering a PhD program in the field, UBC’s program has always been a model of interdisciplinarity, and that, I think, is one of its core strengths. The program’s 60-plus Faculty Associates hail from the Faculties of Arts, Education, Law, Science, Applied Science and Medicine, and come together collaboratively and collegially to provide unique, creative and far-reaching learning and research opportunities for UBC students.  In addition, the Centre has forged strong links with other interdisciplinary units on campus, including the Liu Institute, the Institute of Asian Research, St. John’s College, the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, the Human Early Learning Project (in Medicine), the First Nations House of Learning, and the Centre for Feminist Legal Studies.  Over time, as these cross-campus relationships have expanded, the focus of the program and of the research conducted here has also  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 20  expanded to address a broader diversity of issues. Research clusters now include literature, film and cultural studies; social policy and community action; critical studies in sexuality; migration and racialization; international development; gender and health; class; poverty and inequality; and the Centre for Studies in Autobiography, Gender and Age. Advised on the working climate survey in the Faculty of Science – personally grateful.  Graduate students come from Canada, Chile, China, India, Korea, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States, bringing with them a wide range of perspectives on topics as diverse as sex workers in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside; post-communist Eastern European women’s narratives of trauma; international adoptions in India and Korea; and the representation of Thai women on Intermarriage websites, to name just a very few.  As well, the Center for Women’s and Gender Studies has always held as part of its mandate the imperative to connect with, to draw from, and to give back to the larger community. Long before “community service learning” became a pillar of UBC’s institutional vision, this  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 21  Centre lived out that practice, not only within the UBC community, but also in the local, national and international communities.  On an international scale, the Centre initiated a Visiting Scholars Program that drew researchers from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.  Locally, the Centre enjoys longstanding partnerships with many community organizations, including the BC Centre for Excellence in Women’s Health, the Aboriginal Women’s Action Network and the Disabled Women’s Network. These partnerships provide practicum opportunities for UBC students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and, in the past, provided space and resources to community-based researchers from partner organizations to come to campus for a month or two months to conduct research that connected directly to policy issues and social transformation.  And here on campus, the UBC Scholar Program gave UBC faculty a one-term teaching release to conduct research at the Centre.  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 22  You’ll notice, though, that I have begun speaking in the past tense. I am aware that three of the Centre’s four core programs have been suspended, and within the fourth, graduate studies, the PhD program is now in jeopardy as well.  In terms of the community programs, many of the Centre’s partners are women’s organizations, and many of those have had their government funding cut in the last two years. Some of these groups don’t even exist any more, and many of those that do no longer have the resources required to take in students for placement. This situation is extremely worrisome, because we’re facing the loss of tangible benefits to both the University and the community.5  What occurs to me is that we are going to have to look for new ways to connect into the community. I’d like to consider the possibility of working more intentionally on gender issues through UBC’s Learning Exchange, for example, and perhaps through some of the other community service learning partnerships that now exist. Instead of  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 23  creating stand-alone programmes, e may have to share in existing programmes, building out new relationships.  With respect to the PhD program, currently there are 18 students enrolled, and every year since its inception in 2001 the program has had to turn away at least 90 percent of applicants. In 2007, the program received 28 applications; two new students were accepted. As I mentioned, there are only three PhD programs in women’s and gender studies in Canada, and the demand for places, and for scholarships—as well as the need for this research—is much higher than can currently be met. Faculty resources are certainly an issue; at UBC, the grad program and the Centre combined have just half a faculty appointment, and a Director. Those 60 Faculty Associates I spoke of earlier come from Faculties all across campus and commit their time to ensure that this program can continue.  Although decisions around faculty resources must be made by the Faculties themselves, I will take this opportunity to say that PhD students are fundamental to the research success of any unit in the University, and I would be interested in working with the Centre as it  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 24  seeks sustainable ways to address this problem. It is vital that students have a place to do this work, and it is vital to UBC and to the communities we touch that we continue to provide the place to do this work.  Over the past 35 years, Women’s and Gender Studies Research has exemplified the power of education and critical reflection to render the invisible visible, and to transform at individual and political levels. The act of engendering issues of social justice—here in the Centre and elsewhere in the University—is an act of making the unseen seen. We are re-membering the disappeared. We’re removing these lenses we’re so accustomed to looking through, and learning to see one another, human being to human being—even to see those we have seen before as if for the first time. We are not leaving the eye alone for a second.  Thank you. -30-  [words: 4,270]  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 25  Engendering Social Justice  Professor Toope—Keynote Speech  Page 26  
1.0107484~Onward and upward for B.C.'s universities : the first system-wide study in decades makes a compelling case for shared resources and focused energies~Toope, Stephen J.~The text below originally appeared as an Opinion-Editorial piece in the May 2, 2007 edition of the Vancouver Sun.  Onward and upward for B.C.'s universities; The first system-wide study in decades makes a compelling case for shared resources and focused energies Campus 2020, a comprehensive report on B.C.’s post-secondary system released this week by special advisor Geoff Plant, sets out an audacious plan for the future of learning and research in British Columbia. One of the many achievements of Mr. Plant’s sweeping review and recommendations is the clarity with which his report addresses the provincial government’s “great goal” to be North America’s best-educated and most literate jurisdiction. Not only has he suggested that universities must work together to share resources and focus energies, he has also posited new mechanisms to ensure greater cooperation between universities and the communities in which they are active. There hasn’t been a system-wide vision comparable to what Mr. Plant delivered this week to Premier Gordon Campbell since John MacDonald’s 1962 report, Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future. There is much to praise in Campus 2020, and much for the government to contemplate in the coming months. Two linked ideas particularly resonate in my reading of the report. First, Mr. Plant clearly believes, as I do, that across B.C.’s post-secondary system, institutional differentiation must be nurtured as carefully as institutional diversity is celebrated. Acknowledging the importance of access to BC’s postsecondary offerings, he praises the breadth of choice on a continuum from skills training to graduate research. But he goes further. For any of BC’s higher education institutions to be truly excellent at the global level, we must have the focus of clear differentiation in mandate and funding framework. For example, within the university sector, Mr. Plant differentiates between the special roles of regional universities (like Kwantlen, Fraser Valley and Malaspina, which he recommends transitioning to full university status) and those of the research-intensive institutions (UBC, UVic and SFU). “We must ensure,” Mr. Plant writes, “that we have, within the province, institutions recognized as global leaders in teaching and in knowledge discovery, creation and application. These research-intensive institutions must continue to be the key incubators of the innovation needed to address our most pressing social and environmental challenges and to develop a strong economy.”  The second idea that resonated strongly with me – it flows from the first -- is how to best support the research-intensive universities. Mr. Plant recommends that BC move from the current national position of fifth in provincial research funding to the top three. And he goes much further, calling for UBC, UVic and SFU to form a Georgia Strait research cluster that would receive at least 95 per cent of provincial research funding. He notes: “The only chance we have of creating a world-class centre of research excellence lies in the southwestern corner of the province.” Mr. Plant adeptly recognizes the critical role that graduate students play in the research enterprise, from assisting senior investigators to renewing the professoriate. “To build world-class learning institutions,” he writes, “there must be an additional intensity of dedication to excellence at higher levels of learning, particularly in graduate studies.” He sets a bold target: by 2015, BC should have the highest per capita grad student enrolment in Canada. And he maintains focus: all new graduate spaces should be allocated to the Georgia Strait research cluster, according to the existing distribution of research funding and grad student enrolment. For this increased public investment in research, Mr. Plant wants, naturally, to see greater public benefits. He notes UBC’s technology transfer success in the life sciences, which has attracted $1.5 billion in private investment and placed it among North America’s top 10 universities for spin-off companies and patents. But the Georgia Strait universities, he believes, can and must expand their partnerships to create equally valuable social and economic innovation in areas as diverse as multiculturalism, environmental science, global migration and changing demographics. While all involved will scan Campus 2020 through their particular lens, I believe that we can all agree it is as thoughtful and comprehensive a prescription as any could have wished from the intensive five-month consultation that Mr. Plant led. From inspiring goals for Aboriginal participation, to bold ideas on tuition and financial assistance, and an entirely new accountability infrastructure, Mr. Plant has made a remarkable contribution to our province’s post-secondary future.

1.0107477~2009 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2009 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  25-27 November 2009 I  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2009.  A graduation is an obvious time to think about the future. Although you graduates are no doubt also reflecting back over your experiences at UBC – the friends made, the studying done, the exams and papers written, the commitments to clubs, sports, theatre, and music fulfilled – in this moment of transition, it is to the future that we tend to look. Graduates are almost inevitably asking themselves: “What will I do with my life?” or “How can I make a difference in our world?”  Although these moments of reflection can be a little scary, I think that they are supremely valuable. Our lives are so often filled with mere busyness; we are harassed by the technological possibilities of constant communication through text messages, phone calls, tweets, Facebook, blogs. We leave ourselves little opportunity to really think. So, as hard as it is, I urge you graduates to treasure this moment of uncertainty, poised between past and future, and to use it wisely.  2  My theme today is time and action. One of the pieces of writing that has influenced me most over the years is “Burnt Norton,” a beautiful poem by T.S. Eliot. The first in a cycle called the Four Quartets, “Burnt Norton” is an exploration of human life in time and of our difficult relationship to the universe. For Eliot, humanity is trapped in time, but is eager to find redemption, much like people caught in Dante’s Inferno. Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. If all time is eternally present All time is unredeemable. What might have been is an abstraction Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a world of speculation. “What might have been is an abstraction…”. That is an encouraging idea, I think. Eliot wrote “Burnt Norton” before the Second World War, as Europe was descending into economic and social chaos. The other poems of the Four Quartets he wrote during the War. Eliot was active in the war effort on the home front, and he feared the breaking up of society and culture. It is not surprising that Eliot’s theme in these poems was a search for integration, for unity – what in “Burnt Norton” he called “the still point in the turning world.” Eliot suspected that unity could only be achieved outside time. His work 3  was therefore challenged by some critics as too mystical, too rooted in a particularly Christian view of salvation after life, after time, to speak to the real threats of people confronting crisis and war.  And yet, in the Four Quartets Eliot details moments of enlightenment and inspiration in time. But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden, The moment in the arbour where the rain beat, The moment in the draughty church at smokefall Be remembered; involved with past and future. Only through time time is conquered.  Instead of reading the poem as entirely an escape from time, I think of that moment in the rose garden as a calling to the here and now, as an assertion that life today matters because the past is unchangeable and the future unpredictable, even unknowable. Sudden in a shaft of sunlight Even while the dust moves There rises the hidden laughter Of children in the foliage Quick now, here, now, always— Ridiculous the waste sad time Stretching before and after.  “Quick now, here now, always –” This almost breathless phrase connects to one of Eliot’s principal sources for “Burnt Norton,” the 4  Bhagavad-Gita, a Hindu sacred text. The Gita takes the form of a conversation between Lord Krishna and the brilliant warrior prince, Arjuna, and occurs on the battlefield before the start of a war. Krishna reveals himself as the Supreme Being and warns that death can come along at any moment, that we cannot simply live for the future.  In a verse that rings loud in any university, Krishna announces: Out of compassion for them [the human race], I, residing in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. (10.11)  In this beautiful space of the Chan Centre, I hope that you graduates have some sense of the shining lamp of knowledge given to each one of us. How will you use yours? Eliot helps us understand that now is the time to fulfill our promise. Now is the time to be the best that we can be. Now is our chance to act in time, and perhaps to accomplish things that transcend time.  We waste time regretting the past and we waste time when we think only about what comes next. What might have been is an abstraction 5  Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a world of speculation.  Or, in the pithier words of Winston Churchill: “It is better to be making the news than taking it; to be an actor rather than a critic.”  I hope that you will take your own particular light of knowledge, go out those doors, and act…in our time. Thank you.  6  
1.0107480~Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope : Hong Kong alumni Christmas dinner, December 7, 2009~Toope, Stephen J.~Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 1 of 8  Thank you, Connie (Leung).  Good Evening! I am delighted that you could join us here tonight.  It is great to be back in Hong Kong, almost exactly a year to the day since we last met. We have a great deal of news to bring you concerning the past year, as well as a look ahead.  I want to begin with an item of interest that I touched upon last year. It is a once-in-a-lifetime event that begins exactly 66 days from today – the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. As you may already know, UBC’s Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre will be the venue for men’s and women’s hockey and men’s sledge hockey during the games. That means that in exactly 67 days, Canada’s defending Olympic champion women’s hockey team will be on the ice at UBC to face off against Slovakia in the opening round. Not only that, but exactly 65 days from today, the Olympic torch relay will pass through the Vancouver campus on the final leg of its journey from the ancient Greek city of Olympia to downtown Vancouver.  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 2 of 8  Are we excited? Yes, we most certainly are excited – excited and honoured to again be at the centre of a globally significant event.  In order to take full advantage of the Olympic experience, we also have a series of critical dialogues and public symposia planned from now until February – just as a university should. These events will enable the community to hear UBC experts explore a wide range of games-related subjects such as public spending priorities, drugs and sport, and other important topics.  While the 2010 Games are one of the hottest topics on campus, another hot topic in our current economic environment – not surprisingly – is money. When I was here last year, the global economic crisis was just beginning to take hold. Shortly after that visit, I issued the first of a series of four letters to the community outlining how the crisis was affecting UBC.  Overall, I would say that, although there are some bumps in the road ahead, the situation is not critical. In fact, we are much better off than other Canadian and most US schools, particularly with respect to the health of our operating budgets, our endowments and pension plans.  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 3 of 8  But what is even better news is that the provincial and federal governments continue to be the greatest financial supporters of the university. In fact, the 2009 spring provincial budget actually increased our base operating support. This is very good news, which was reaffirmed by the September provincial budget.  For anyone wanting more substantive details, those four letters are still available for viewing at the president’s office homepage – simply go to president.ubc.ca.  Some of you may recall that last year I reported on the process of reviewing our strategic plan. I am delighted to report that the plan has been ratified by our Senates and by the Board of Governors. Now called Place and Promise: The UBC Plan, and it is now available for viewing on the web at strategicplan.ubc.ca.  One of the first things you might notice is that the vision for the University, in essence, remains consistent with that of Trek 2010. But we now focus more on UBC as a complete learning community for students, faculty and staff – working together to promote global citizenship and a sustainable and civil society.  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 4 of 8  To that end, we have identified corresponding values and clearly linked commitments and action items, and we have also specifically linked the plan to a new UBC budget process.  One of the fundamental commitments in Place and Promise is to student learning – a subject that we have heard loud and clear is of particular interest to alumni. In fact, probably the question I am most frequently asked by alumni is: “is the university doing anything to improve undergraduate education?”  The answer is an emphatic yes, and we already have a wide range of initiatives under way.  For example, our LEAD initiative is designed to focus us more on undergraduate learning, and specifically on utilizing the research of Nobel-laureate Carl Wieman and others on what constitutes an outstanding learning environment, both inside and outside the classroom.  Enhancing undergraduate learning also means greater focus on student engagement. One of our primary areas of interest is on student housing and on building a sustainable and vibrant campus community. While UBC leads Canada in provision of on-campus  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 5 of 8  housing, we need to do more. We have already surpassed the target of 1,000 student beds at UBCO. At UBC Vancouver, a student housing strategy has been presented to increase the housing opportunities by some 2,500 beds within four years.  Internationalization of student opportunity is also a key priority. We’ve already got some wonderful programs in place, such as Go Global and International Service Learning, but currently we are only able to provide opportunities for about 17 per cent of our undergraduate students. I would like to see what it would take to get us closer to something like 30 per cent over the next five years.  Overall, we are exploring a wide range of enriched learning opportunities for undergraduate students. In fact, if you look at the Student Learning commitment in Place and Promise, you will see a specific action item to provide all students with at least two special educational enrichment opportunities during their course of studies. These enrichment opportunities can take the form of a research activity, first-year small class experience, international learning, community service learning, or co-op or internship opportunities.  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 6 of 8  I also want to briefly touch upon two initiatives which are allied to the new strategic plan. First, the Board has approved a move into the first phase of a major fundraising campaign – one that will allow us to further diversify our funding sources and that will be premised on harnessing philanthropy behind clearly articulated university priorities.  The other is a new identity we have forged for UBC. If you have visited our website recently, you will have noticed a distinctly different look and feel founded on the motto UBC: A Place of Mind.  A couple of years ago it became apparent to us that we needed to find a way to better tell UBC’s story in a compelling way. A great deal of consultation and research went into this initiative to determine which characteristics would best serve to differentiate UBC within a crowded market. We concluded that there are three.  The first is that we have students with the academic qualifications to attend any university in the world.  Second, our research achievements have earned UBC widespread recognition as one of Canada’s and the world’s finest universities.  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 7 of 8  Third, the inspiring locations and openness of our campus environments lend themselves to essential forms of human interaction – social, intellectual and international – all of critical importance in stimulating an atmosphere of deep learning and leading edge innovation.  We started a campaign back in September focused first in BC that features bold headlines and imagery telling stories of the amazing things that happen -- From Here, UBC…this unique place of mind. This campaign will roll out nationally and internationally over the next 18 months.  Although it is too early to tell, we are optimistic that this strategy will succeed in telling UBC’s story to wider audiences, and will strengthen our efforts to attract new strategic partnerships, and to recruit even more of the best and brightest students and faculty from around the world. In order to help reveal the essence of your university’s new identity, I want to close with a short video. Before we do that, please know that, along with our annual report, you will also  Remarks for Professor Stephen J. Toope Hong Kong Alumni Christmas Dinner December 7, 2009 Page 8 of 8  receive a copy of Place and Promise tonight, and you’ll also find a comprehensive version of it online.  I hope that in the coming year when you think of place - this place we call UBC - you’ll think not only of the Point Grey and Okanagan campuses, but also of the UBC-supported clinics and hospitals around the province whose doors are open at this very minute serving the needs of four-and-a-half million British Columbians. I hope too that you’ll think of the UBC Learning Exchanges in the downtown eastside and in Kelowna, whose doors are also open to provide a “hand up” to residents of those communities.  And I hope that when you think of promise, you will think of all that this place of mind can yet become, and all that UBC’s students, staff, faculty, alumni, and community supporters can yet learn … can yet discover … can yet contribute … each of us in our own way.  Thank you once again for being here this evening.  Warmest holiday wishes to all.  
1.0107482~Xerox business live~Toope, Stephen J.~XEROX BUSINESS LIVE Breakfast Event, Tuesday, February 16, 2010, 7:45 – 10:00 a.m. Hotel Vancouver and Vancouver Art Gallery  Doug [Lord], thank you for that kind introduction. And to everyone at Xerox Global Solutions, thank you for welcoming me here today. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of The University of British Columbia, it‘s an honour to welcome you to Vancouver and to the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.  It hasn‘t escaped my attention—and I would just like to draw your attention to the fact—that I‘m sharing the podium this morning with two former Olympic athletes! It‘s all I can do, frankly, not to raise my arms in the ‗Victory‘ salute, but I promised Doug I wouldn‘t, and that I wouldn‘t sing the national anthem, and that he could just give me my medal later and we could keep it very low key.  But I think my place in this lineup does raise the question of how a university president belongs here today, and in fact what useable ideas a university president may have to offer a group of senior business leaders on the wisdom and importance of investing in the Olympics as a means of attracting and retaining good people.1  So the way I want to spend my time with you this morning is in exploring a couple of big questions: The first is, Is there a way to look at these Olympic Games as 1  Topic requested by Xerox head office.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 2 of 16  an opportunity to redefine ‗investment‘ and ‗economic benefit?‘ Secondly, how can benefits from a short-term event elicit people‘s long-term commitment to an organization, or a region? And third, Is it possible to learn to recognize nontraditional investment opportunities in the Games that will inspire that kind of commitment?  As I look for answers to these three big questions, I‘m going to talk about what I know best, which is how an organization with two campuses and multiple other sites, a $2.0 billion annual budget and real financial challenges brought about by the economic downturn, 50,000 students and 19,000 employees has found in the Olympics an opportunity to benefit not just UBC but everyone the university touches—from students, staff, faculty, and alumni to community members, Vancouver residents, First Nations communities, Canadian citizens and international partners.  So, to my first question: Are the 2010 Olympic Games going to be our opportunity to redefine ‗investment‘ and ‗economic benefit?‘ To begin to answer that, I‘d like to tell you a story.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 3 of 16  Redefining ‘Investment’ and ‘Economic Benefit’ With Respect to the Olympics Three years after the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, a group of business people from Vancouver‘s Board of Trade made a trip to Utah to see what they could learn about how a host city can benefit from a global event like the Olympics. One of the people they spoke with during the course of their stay was a furniture dealer, and they asked him if having the Games come to his State had helped his business. In answer, the dealer grinned, shook his head, and said, ―Latvians don‘t buy sofas.‖  Tourists and locals alike are here for the Games, not to buy sofas or anything else. But that doesn‘t stop enthusiastic backers from making Olympic-sized predictions about how businesses will get rich quick. When BC launched the bid for these Games 12 years ago, the claim was that hosting the Olympics would bring $1 billion worth of economic growth and 25,000 jobs. Three years later, that prediction had grown to $2.8 billion and 67,000 jobs. In 2002, a revised study predicted $10 billion in growth and 228,000 jobs.  But in 2003, University of British Columbia economist David Green crunched the numbers to determine the long-term economic benefits of hosting a Winter Olympics, and concluded in a report to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives that they were ―extremely limited.‖ Economist Jeffrey Owen of Minnesota noted that Games rarely if ever produce the new jobs or the visitor  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 4 of 16  spending that their boosters predict because of the way they are financed. In 2008, an independent international accounting firm found that the region‘s economy had grown just one-tenth of one percent as a result of the Games. UBC real estate professor Tsur Somerville and three-time Olympian Jake Wetzel published a study just last month, saying, ―We do not find support for the argument of host city backers that the Olympics delivers positive economic benefits.‖  Robert Barney, director of the International Centre for Olympic Studies at the University of Western Ontario, says, ―There has never been an Olympic Games that has made a profit.‖ In cases where surpluses were claimed, such as by LA, Calgary, and Salt Lake City, massive federal spending was left out of the calculations.  There are businesses that will do very well in the next few weeks. They include hotels, restaurants close to Olympic venues, and ski resorts near where Olympic events are taking place. Tourist outlets generally may also do well, and the BC government is betting millions on the hope that tourism will increase long term.  But there are also many businesses that suffered and even closed their doors over the past several years as a result of lost revenues during infrastructure construction. Column A and Column B on the balance sheet are neck and neck.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 5 of 16  All this to say that if we look for economic benefits in the customary places, we‘ll probably be disappointed. However, there are three areas where economists generally agree an Olympics host is likely to see benefits.  The first is in international trade. Economist Andrew Rose at the University of California, Berkeley, says the benefits go not only to the host city but also and equally to those cities that bid and lose. Here‘s why: ―When a country submits a serious bid to host the Olympics,‖ Rose says, ―what they‘re really doing is saying that they‘re open for business … and a serious member of the international community.‖ Of course, Vancouver hung its shingle out during the 1986 World Exposition. The explosive growth that has occurred here in the quarter-century since will be a tough act to follow. But it‘s not out of the question, and certainly both government and industry are hoping for a show-stopping second act.  The second generally agreed-upon area of economic benefit is infrastructure improvements. Although many host cities have been left with stadiums and other structures that have sat empty in the years following the event, (as a parenthesis, I am a Montrealer by origin. I was paying for the 1976 Olympic Stadium on my property tax bill until 2006!) the Games can act as a catalyst for substantial and even historic change when development focuses on enhancing the quality of citizens‘ lives in the long term. In this respect, Vancouver will have done very well. We have a new Sea to Sky Highway that allows for increased and safer travel between the Lower Mainland and Whistler. A new convention centre and a  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 6 of 16  new rapid transit line that connects our international airport to the downtown core. Two new, sustainable, state-of-the-art athletics facilities – one on UBC‘s Vancouver Campus - that will be well used after the Games. And the Athletes‘ Village will be converted into much-needed low-income housing once the Games are over.  So one, international trade and two, infrastructure improvements. Both are likely to have a measurable effect on the region‘s ability to attract and retain good people. But the third area of benefit is of a different order entirely. It‘s the least tangible, and arguably the most interesting. This is the one that has the potential to redefine the term ‗economic benefit.‘ The one that requires us to reconsider what we mean by ‗investment opportunity.‘ And this is the one that I am convinced has the greatest influence on whether people come to an organization, or a city, and whether they stay.  The third area of benefit, which all experts seem to agree accrues to an Olympic Games host, is … happiness. Media pundits call it ‗the feel-good factor.‘ Politicians call it ‗civic pride,‘ the opportunity to celebrate human achievement and the Olympic ideals. But whatever you call it, the question is, how does it translate into tangible benefits like talent retention? Here are some of the answers I‘ve found.  Happiness and HR – How It Works  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 7 of 16  In September of last year, French president Nicolas Sarcozy drew on a report led by Nobel Prize-winning US economist Joseph Stiglitz and called for us all to remeasure our GDP according to a ‗joie de vivre‘ index. Vancouver‘s Board of Trade has a Chief Happiness Officer. The Dean of UBC‘s own Sauder Business School quoted the Buddha in one of Canada‘s national newspapers on the importance of giving back. So has the economic downturn shaken some bearings loose, or are these business leaders onto something real?  Research says it‘s real. UBC economist John Helliwell, a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and a co-director of the Social Interactions, Identity and Well-Being Program, told the Vancouver Board of Trade that ―it is engagement that keeps us happy,‖ and that when happiness rather than money becomes the currency of engagement, then interacting and networking with others becomes exponentially more powerful. At a recent conference on WellBeing and Sustainability, Helliwell demonstrated the potential power of happiness to help communities develop efficient responses to community-wide, nation-wide or even global opportunities or challenges.  Speaking of sustainability, I read an interview with Patricia Calkins, Xerox‘s Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety, where she said, ―From the beginning, I wanted to do something that was meaningful to society. When I got into the environmental realm, I saw the opportunity to make contributions.‖ When she was asked what was next for her, she answered: ―As long as I … feel that  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 8 of 16  I‘m contributing in a way that makes a difference, I will be really happy with where I am.‖  Lest I be seen to be playing favourites with my examples, let me point to the work of American economist Richard Florida, who studies the effects of creativity and diversity on the long-term economic health of cities and regions. He calls his measuring stick the Creativity Index, and he‘s translated dense economic theory into popular non-fiction books such as Who’s Your City?, which people are now using to determine where they would be happiest living and working.  Florida says, ―Smart people are the most critical resource to any economy.‖ The key to attracting and retaining them is being the kind of place that encourages diversity, the kind of place, he says, ―where people can find opportunity, build support structures, be themselves, and not get stuck in any one identity.‖ He‘s been able to demonstrate that a geographical clustering of this kind of talent exerts considerable influence on the location of high-technology industries and on regional incomes.  So to recap: First, Olympic windfalls are a pipe dream for most businesses. On a regional scale, even international trade and infrastructure development can be long-term gambles. But apparently the ‗sure thing‘ is an increase in happiness. Second, happiness correlates to well-being, job satisfaction, economic strength, and the ability to respond effectively to local to global opportunities and  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 9 of 16  challenges. Third: The best chance any organization, city, or region has of attracting the best and brightest in the world and keeping them happy is to be a place that embraces diversity. Cultural. Intellectual. Diversity of expression, creativity, and contribution.  So if THAT‘s our goal,—encouraging diversity—how can investing in an event that lasts just a few weeks lead to the kind of long-term commitment we‘re looking for from our people? The answer lies in reconsidering what we mean by ‗investment‘ and, perhaps, whose happiness we‘re talking about.  The Royal Caribbean Factor and the Olympic Games A story: Just a week or so following the earthquake that devastated Haiti and left so many there homeless, injured, or dead, the media reported that Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines was still bringing holiday-goers into a resort just miles from the capitol to feast and suntan and play. Journalists—and many viewers— found the juxtaposition morally repugnant. Royal Caribbean responded by continuing to operate, to employ their Haitian resort staff, and to provide an influx of foreign cash into the local economy. They ferried relief supplies in and donated $1 million toward the rebuilding of the country‘s infrastructure. Was any of that an investment for them? It doesn‘t fit any of the standard criteria. But those cruise line staff, those patrons, and all the people around the world who understood Royal Caribbean‘s response will remember—likely for the rest of their lives— that  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 10 of 16  in the moment of greatest need, at the epicenter of the disaster, they made a difference.  Back to the 2010 Olympic host city. David Eby, executive director of the BC Civil Liberties Association, was quoted in the UK Guardian last week saying, ―There are those who argue that we shouldn‘t be spending billions on a two-week party until we‘ve dealt with the fact that people are freezing and starving in our streets.‖  And they are. Just blocks from here, in fact, in the midst of a city hailed as one of the most livable in the world, people are dying for want of food and shelter.  But some groups representing those people are looking at these Games as a catalyst for change. Michelle Clausius of Covenant House, an organization that supports homeless young people, says, ―I can‘t say for sure if the same level of … support towards reducing homelessness would have occurred without the Olympics, but I know that the issue is much more in the spotlight than it was prior to the awarding of the Games.‖  Where does The University of British Columbia stand in this great debate? Or, for that matter, on the issue of the Olympics‘ carbon footprint? Or of the perception that the Games make only jocks and sports fans happy? It‘s the jocks versus the nerds, I‘ve heard. The pro-Games boosters versus the nay-saying bean counters. So where does UBC stand?  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 11 of 16  Well, first, UBC has had more than 250 of its ‗nerds‘ compete in Olympic Games since 1928. We prefer the term ‗well-rounded.‘  And second, these Olympics aren‘t a for-or-against proposition. We don‘t stand on either side. What UBC stands for is exceptional teaching and learning; research excellence; and engagement with, and service to, the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world. Those are our core commitments, and they didn‘t change when the Olympics came to town. They‘re backed by commitments to sustainability, intercultural understanding, and an outstanding work environment. And based on those commitments, since the day Vancouver was named as the 2010 host city, UBC has been very substantially invested in the Olympics.  UBC is a host venue for the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the programmer and host for over 200 public arts, science, and technology events running before and during the Games. UBC Robson Square, our downtown Vancouver site, is the BC International Media Centre and home to 3,000 journalists for the duration of the Games. The three billion worldwide viewers we‘ve been told to expect are getting a clear and close look at The University of British Columbia.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 12 of 16  UBC researchers are conducting the world‘s first IOC-mandated Olympic Games Impact Assessment. The results will help future bidders and organizing committees maximize the positive impact of hosting the Games, and create the social, economic, and environmental standards by which all future Games are measured. Half the funding for the $600,000 study comes from VANOC, and the other half from UBC.  As part of Canada‘s Own the Podium 2010 initiative, UBC researchers have developed high-level techniques and equipment to give Canadians an edge in competition. That investment has paid off already with a 41 percent increase in medals won at Olympic Winter Games between 2002 and 2006, almost all by female athletes, I might add.  These investments—in infrastructure, publicity, sustainability research, and human athletic achievement—are ones you might expect. In terms of sheer numbers, though, the majority of our investments are much less obvious. But they are no less important.  For starters, some of the most vocal protestors against the Games come from among UBC‘s students, staff, faculty, and alumni. Over the past year and continuing through the Games, the University has made dialogue opportunities available to those who want a forum. In fact, I believe the UBC community is  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 13 of 16  uniquely positioned to instigate a potentially transformative exchange of ideas on questions of economic, environmental, and social justice.  Several faculties are running courses on Olympics-related topics. Public seminar series are bringing athletes, experts, and learners together to discuss issues of sport and its potential as a tool for social justice and peace. UBC‘s online institutional repository, called cIRcle, collects Olympics-related theses and other materials, and all of its contents are freely available to users around the world.  How else are we invested? Well, UBC students are out of class these next two weeks, on their annual reading break. And a thousand of them are using the time to volunteer with inner-city school children in a program called Community Service Learning. They‘ll see issues of sustainability, literacy, and poverty through the eyes of some of the city‘s most vulnerable residents.  Another 400 students are helping to run a free health clinic in the Downtown Eastside, known as Canada‘s poorest postal code. At another clinic, fourth-year dental students provide oral health care to low-income, high-risk residents. The Street Nurse Program, made up in large part of UBC graduates, provides health care to people living in the alleys and hotels of this same area of the city. And UBC‘s Faculty of Law runs the First Nations Legal Clinic, providing legal services to disadvantaged members of First Nations communities.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 14 of 16  Here‘s another not-so-obvious investment. UBC is using the Games to focus international efforts on halting the progression of HIV and AIDS. A conference will be held next week on the UBC campus, and a panel of the world‘s best minds in research, industry, policy, and philanthropy will show what can be accomplished in the arena of global health when nations work together.  These are not traditional investment scenarios. I can‘t give you a cost-benefit analysis, or predict the University‘s ROI. If I had to make an educated guess, though, I would say that the investments we‘re making in the Olympics in the areas of teaching and learning; in research; and in community service are going to have long-term pay-offs exponentially greater than those we‘ve made in the more standard investment arenas. Our operating models differ, I know. But whether we‘re a university, a community, or a corporation, our capacity to invest in this way differs only by degree. Even a single individual can do it.  Which brings me to my last story. It‘s about a young journalist, author, and media consultant named Charles Montgomery who had a room to rent out during the Olympic Games. He was more interested in providing a visitor with a nice place to stay than in getting rich quick, so he set a reasonable rate and committed to donating half of whatever he made to two charities that support Vancouver‘s homeless. Friends heard what he was doing and wanted to join in. Before long, Montgomery was running a full-fledged enterprise called Home for the Games.  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 15 of 16  His Olympic goals are 1,000 host homes and $750,000 for Covenant House and the Street-to-Home Foundation, and he‘s well on his way.  Montgomery is in demand as a writer, his laptop is his office, and he could make his living from anywhere in the world. But he chooses to stay here in Vancouver, where he is free to protest the Games if he wants to, where he can write and say what he wishes, and where the opportunity exists to make a real and tangible difference in the lives of his fellow citizens.  And here‘s the epilogue: In his spare time, Montgomery‘s writing a book on what makes cities happy. It seems he learned from a UBC economics professor named John Helliwell that IF they fostered a stronger culture of big-heartedness and volunteerism, the Olympics could make Vancouver happier.  Conclusion It‘s the nature of good business to go for the gold. But it‘s the nature of wisdom to look to the tarnished places, too, and to help uncover what‘s underneath. The Olympic Games provide an unparalleled opportunity to do both.  At their essence, the Olympics serve to remind us of the very best of human achievement, and to inspire us to pursue that—not just for ourselves, not just for our athletes, but for everyone. Whatever anyone may think of the Olympic  Xerox Business Live Breakfast Event 16 February 2010 Page 16 of 16  machine, the Olympic spirit is something that the best among us all want to be part of. Invest in making that possible, and you‘ll never want for good company. Thank you. -30-  
1.0107505~Torture : can law prevent it? A lecture at the University of Melbourne~Toope, Stephen J.~Torture: Can Law Prevent it? A Lecture at the University of Melbournei Stephen J. Toope 18 May 2011 Introduction  Does international law matter? Does it influence the behavior of states and, if so, how? Why do states comply with international law, or why not? These are among the questions that international relations scholars and, more recently, international lawyers have been asking about the role of international law in international society. What has been generally absent from these inquiries is sustained engagement with a prior question: what distinguishes legal norms from other social norms?  In Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account Jutta Brunnée (of the University of Toronto) and I argue that law‟s distinctiveness rests in the concept and operation in practice of legal obligation. The prevailing accounts of international law pay remarkably little attention to the role of legal obligation, and how it is generated. Many international lawyers view obligation simply as the legal consequence of formal validity or state consent, or take its existence in international practice as given.  Some have gone so far as to suggest that the concept of  international legal obligation is theoretically uninteresting and practically irrelevant. I strongly disagree.  In this lecture, I will briefly set out the parameters of what Brunnée and I call an “interactional approach to international law.”  Then, I will use that  framework to answer the teasing question that I posed in the lecture title: “Torture: Can Law Prevent It?” The lecture is drawn from the much more detailed analysis contained in our book, published just last year by Cambridge University Press.  First, then, a sketching out of the conceptual framework that Brunnée and I propose.  Our framework brings together the legal theory of the mid-twentieth century US scholar, Lon Fuller, and more recent constructivist approaches to International Relations (which I will sometimes refer to as IR) to provide a richer understanding of legal obligation. Constructivism helps us illuminate how shared social norms emerge and shape social interaction. We then rely on a set of criteria of legality identified by Fuller to argue that legal norms exert a distinctive influence. I will enumerate those criteria shortly.  But  Brunnée and I emphasize that law‟s influence does not arise simply when social norms meet these criteria of legality. Building on Emanuel Adler‟s work on transnational “communities of practice,” we show that the obligatory effect of international law must be generated and maintained through practices that sustain legality over time.  In short, the three inter-related  elements of our framework – shared understandings, criteria of legality and a practice of legality – are crucial to generating distinctive legal legitimacy and a sense of commitment among those to whom law is addressed. They create legal obligation.  2  A strong claim concerning legal legitimacy is implicit in our framework: only when law is made through the interactional approach we describe can it be said that the law is „legitimate.‟ This distinctive legal legitimacy does not merely produce adherence to specific rules, but generates fidelity to the rule of law itself. Our account highlights that influential norms will not emerge in the absence of processes that allow for the active participation of relevant social actors. Social actors in the global domain include states, of course, but the interactional framework acknowledges the importance of robust participation by intergovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, other collective entities, and individuals. The need for broad participation in the creation and upholding of law (through the evolution of shared understandings, and in the building up of communities of practice) has two further  consequences  worth  noting.  The  interactional  framework  acknowledges and reinforces the diversity of international society, and shows that legal power is more distributed than commonly presumed in rationalist explanations of law.  Let me now break down and explain further the three components of the interactional approach to international law.  Shared Understandings  Social norms can only emerge when they are rooted in an underlying set of shared understandings supporting first the need for normativity, and then particular norms that shape behavior. Actors generate and promote certain understandings, whether through norm entrepreneurship or through the work of epistemic communities, groups of people who learn things together and 3  promote norms based on what they have learned. Shared understandings may emerge, evolve or fade through processes of social interaction and social learning.  Once in existence, shared understandings become background  knowledge or norms that shape how actors perceive themselves and the world, how they form interests and set priorities, and how they make or evaluate arguments. The Criteria of Legality  Legal norms too are rooted in shared social understandings.  These  understandings may entail merely a basic acceptance of the need for law to shape certain social interactions within a society, or they may be more substantive and value-laden. However, shared understandings alone do not make law. Many social norms exist that never reach the threshold of legal normativity. What distinguishes legal norms from other types of social norms is not form or pedigree, but adherence to specific criteria of legality. Lon Fuller set out eight such criteria, which apply to both individual rules and systems of rule-making. Legal norms must be general, prohibiting, requiring or permitting certain conduct. They must also be promulgated, and therefore accessible to the public, enabling actors to know what the law requires. Law should not be retroactive, but prospective, enabling citizens to take the law into account in their decision-making. Actors must also be able to understand what is permitted, prohibited or required by law – the law must be relatively clear.  Law should avoid contradiction, not requiring or permitting and  prohibiting at the same time. Law must be realistic and not demand the impossible. Its demands on citizens must remain relatively constant. Finally,  4  there should be congruence between legal norms and the actions of officials operating under the law.  Fuller stressed that law is not a unidirectional projection of power.  He  emphasized the need for reciprocity between officials and citizens in the creation and maintenance of all law. What is often assumed to be a vertical relationship (of authority and subordination) actually has strong horizontal features, a proposition that makes Fuller‟s work particularly relevant for international law. Reciprocity, in Fuller‟s conception, means that law-givers must be able to expect that citizens will “accept as law and generally observe” the promulgated body of rules. In order for these rules to guide their actions, they must meet the requirements of legality. Therefore, conversely, citizens must be able to expect that the government will abide by and apply these rules, and that official actions will be congruent with posited law and consonant with the requirements of legality.  Reciprocity is deeper than the exchange flowing from the calculation of material interests. When the eight criteria of legality are met, actors will be able to reason with rules because they will share meaningful standards. When rules guide decision-making in this fashion, law will tend to attract its own adherence – „fidelity.‟ Fidelity to law, in our terminology „obligation,‟ is generated because adherence to the criteria of legality in the creation and application of norms produce law that is legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it is addressed.  Legal obligation, then, is best viewed as an  internalized commitment and not as an externally imposed duty matched with a sanction for non-performance.  5  The Practice of Legality  In international society, the deeper sense of reciprocity that I just described is even more salient because states are both subjects and lawmakers (this is what George Scelle famously described as the “dédoublement fonctionelle”).  The  horizontal and reciprocal nature of interactions guided by legality is also central to law‟s distinctive legitimacy. In short, interactional obligation must be practiced to maintain its influence.  The idea of communities of practice, therefore, rounds out our approach to the relationship between law and shared understandings. The key point is that interactional law does not arise simply because a community of practice has grown around a given issue or norm. Only when this community is engaged in a practice of legality can shared legal understandings, be they procedural or substantive, modest or ambitious, be produced, maintained or altered. We suggest that there exist multiple, overlapping communities of legal practice.  Another important point is underscored by focusing on the role of communities of practice:  it is not enough to cast socially shared  understandings in legal form; they cannot simply be „posited.‟ Positive law can be an element of interactional law, often an important element, but it is not necessarily coextensive with it. The communities of practice concept instructs that positive law is a method of „fixing‟ legal understandings – a function that is particularly important in large, diffuse societies. It may also assist in meeting requirements of legality, such as promulgation, clarity, transparency, or predictability. But without sufficiently dense interactions  6  between participants in the legal system, positive law will remain, or become, dead letter.  The interactional account also highlights, then, that the mere declaration of common values in formal law can be deceptive. Without a community of practice, supposed shared values will remain lofty rhetoric.  Yet, for a  community of practice around international legal norms to emerge, it is not necessary to imagine the existence of a homogenous „international community‟ sharing a common goal or vision. It is not necessary to have a morally cohesive „community‟ before lawmaking is possible. Fuller‟s work shows us that a community of legal practice can exist with a thin set of substantive value commitments; indeed, this is the reality of international law today.  Now I will show how this framework helps to make sense of the evolution and current status of the anti-torture norm in international law, sometimes describes as a “peremptory norm” of international law, or jus cogens.  Torture  In the United Nations Convention Against Torture, torture is described as: …any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for [specific] purposes… when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.... 7  The United Nations Committee Against Torture has stated that the prohibition against torture in international law is absolute; that it is a norm of customary international law that must be met at all times.  However powerful the anti-torture norm may have been historically, there can be no doubt that it was severely challenged in the years following the attacks of September 11th, 2001.  Certainly within the United States, a wide  consensus seemed to emerge that torture might be justifiable, even necessary, in circumstances where deep threats to national security – like global terrorism – were present.  In political discourse and on the radio and  television talk shows, “ticking time bomb” scenarios were invoked routinely as examples of when torture might be justified, or at least excused. Popular culture seemed even to glorify acts of patriotic security agents who would torture when necessary to protect their country from harm.  The most  prominent example of that cultural trend was the hit television thriller “24.”  Although 24 was planned before the assaults of 11 September, it soon became identified with a frightening new era of global terrorist threats against the United States. Jack Bauer, the hero, routinely employed forms of torture himself, and the message was clear: the ends justify the means.  The question that arises, from the standpoint of interactional international law, is whether or not 24 was indicative of changing shared understandings within and outside the United States in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 that might have undermined any previously existing international norms against torture. 8  To answer that question, it is first necessary briefly to trace the history of the rule prohibiting torture and to assess whether or not the rule was firmly grounded in widely shared understandings before Osama bin Laden‟s shocking assault on the United States of America. I will then assess the evolution of the shared understandings underpinning the anti-torture norm from 12 September 2001 to date.  Shared Understandings and the Anti-torture Norm Before 11 September 2001  The imposition of severe physical pain to extract information or to punish or degrade human beings has been practiced throughout human history by sadistic criminals, warriors, religious officials, and the state.  It was the  ancient Greek authorities who first came to rely on what would come to be called “torture” to support an emerging law of evidence. In the Roman era, the combination of a growing centralization and capriciousness of power in the hands of the Emperors resulted in the widespread use of torture when prosecuting accusations of treason; here we have the precursor to the link between torture and state security that has defined the use of torture in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. “Torture” is not the application of physical force by anyone; it emerged as a legal process linked closely to judicial procedure. Although Blackstone famously resisted the description of torture as “legal” – he viewed it as an abhorrent continental tradition outside the law – recent scholarship by Edward  9  Peters and others shows that torture emerged in most of the West as an adjunct to processes of public law.  In his magisterial Torture and the Law of Proof, John Langbein traced the legal history of torture in England and continental Europe, and its connection to the laws of proof. In a recent reflection on that history in the light of events after 11 September 2001, Langbein reminds us: “For half a millennium the law courts of continental Europe tortured suspected people to obtain evidence. They acted openly and according to law”. He explains how the criminal procedure became dependent on torture. Langbein suggests that the refusal of English common law to adopt torture was not, pace Blackstone, primarily the result of moral superiority, but because the English laws of proof were so primitive that torture would not have been useful  As early as the Renaissance, however, resistance to the use of torture was building, on grounds of legal logic and moral opprobrium. European states formally abolished the legal use of torture over the course of two centuries during the Enlightenment. Given the domination of Enlightenment discourse over 19th century legal and social historiography, the story of the formal abolition of torture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries across Europe has often been read together with the end of slavery as a triumph of “progressive” sensibility, as part of a narrative of moral perfectibility. Both Langbein and Peters debunk this notion, emphasizing that the “end” of torture was never actually accomplished in state policy, or even in law. As soon as treason was suspected, forms of law permitted torture.  10  With the growth of state power in the later 19th and 20th centuries, in many countries such legal limitations on torture as existed were increasingly ignored. So the „abolition‟ of torture even in Europe was but a fleeting achievement, overrun by the emergence of totalitarian regimes in the USSR, Spain, Italy, and Germany. In the late 1950s, revelations of the routine use of torture by the French in Algeria demonstrated that even democratic regimes could succumb to the temptations of torture in the name of national security.  In the 20th century, further revelations of torture committed by colonial powers emerged in Africa and Asia. With the growth of independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International, documentation of torture became more systematic implicating scores of regimes.  Ironically, perhaps, in exact parallel to these chastening practices was the increasingly forceful rhetorical condemnation of the use of torture in all circumstances  by  the  United  Nations  system  and  by  regional  intergovernmental organizations. In the immediate aftermath of World War Two, and into the 1980s, more and more universally applicable legal instruments were created that sought to outlaw the use of torture in all situations. Similar initiatives were undertaken at the regional level in Latin America, Europe and Africa. With the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2002, torture was categorized as an international crime.  Throughout Western societies, national legal systems, often relying on the formal international legal condemnations of torture, have issued ringing statements upholding the absolute prohibition on the use of torture. In its 11  reasons in the famous 1999 case concerning General Pinochet, the United Kingdom House of Lords concluded that the prohibition on torture constitutes jus cogens, a peremptory norm of international law stronger than any treaty or customary rule. The same position was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Suresh, the UN Torture Committee, and by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  Although it is difficult to assimilate all this contradictory information, we must assess in a dispassionate way whether or not there existed, prior to the events of 11 September 2001, a widely shared understanding that torture is a completely unacceptable practice in all circumstances.  I am forced to a  troubling conclusion that by the end of the 20th century, the norm against torture was strong as an aspiration but was only weakly supported by a shared understanding around the globe.  When confronted by significant threats to national security, and when comforted by the legal concept of “necessity,” and given the opportunity to keep torture from public scrutiny, state leaders often looked the other way or tacitly sanctioned the use of torture by agents of the state. When Al Qaeda succeeded in its attacks on the United States, the shared understanding supporting the prohibition on torture was fragile at best.  Not surprisingly, in the months immediately following the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, in a context of heightened fear and deep frustration, the question of the use of torture came to the forefront. It was in this period that the television programme, 24, with its routine subjugation of terrorist suspects to torture, burst onto the scene. At its height, the show drew 12  roughly 17 million viewers a week in the United States. Opinion leaders in the United States also embraced the show during the years of the Bush Administration.  In a moment of high drama during an otherwise staid panel discussion involving Canadian and American judges, US Supreme Court Justice Scalia chastised a Canadian Federal Court judge who had offered the comment: “Thankfully, security agencies in all our countries do not subscribe to the mantra „What would Jack Bauer do?‟” Justice Scalia pushed back: “Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles.... He saved hundreds of thousands of lives…Are you going to convict Jack Bauer? Say that criminal law is against him? „You have the right to a jury trial?‟ Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer? I don't think so. So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes. And ought we believe in these absolutes?” Bauer‟s fictional methods may even have had a more direct effect upon US interrogation practices in the years after 11 September 2001. In a remarkable admission, the junior Army legal officer who wrote the original opinion justifying the use of 18 “aggressive” interrogation methods at Guantánamo Bay told an interviewer that the hero of 24 “gave people lots of ideas” – she was referring to soldiers who conducted the Guantánamo interrogations. Apparently, many soldiers watched 24 while stationed at Guantánamo: “it was hugely popular,” she suggested.  The increasingly routine infiltration of torture into the popular imagination was not limited to the USA. The television show 24 was shown widely and became popular in scores of countries around the world, including here in 13  Australia.  The recent James Bond thrillers Casino Royale and Die Another  Day, which attracted large audiences globally, also portray grim scenes of torture that are far more explicit than anything shown earlier in the franchise, as did the most recent installment of the Batman series, The Dark Knight.  Aside from the evolution of popular culture, there are other indications that the shared understanding supporting an absolute prohibition on torture was weakening in the years immediately following 11 September 2001. In his 2005 Report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism pointed to “increased questioning or compromising of the absolute prohibition on torture and all forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” as a global phenomenon. In human rights reports dating from the early to late-2000s, independent investigators from NGOs, as well as official sources in the US government, detailed a worrying list of states from around the globe that committed torture: Albania, Burundi, China, Egypt, Iran, Kahzakstan, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Turkey, and Zimbabwe are but some examples. Governments of these states often invoked “terrorism” as the scourge that they were trying to suppress. At the level of official action in the world‟s remaining superpower, conscious and forceful attempts were made by the Bush Administration to re-interpret the very idea of torture so as to render “aggressive interrogations” by US and allied intelligence agencies lawful. Given its importance in global society and the special status of the United States as the state directly affected by the 11 September 2001 attacks, its response deserves careful attention.  14  In our book, Brunnée and I detail the evolution of US policy and practice from 2001 to 2006. I can only offer a few excerpts here. As early as 14 September 2001 Vice-President Cheney vowed to use “any means at our disposal” to fight what was already being described as the “War on Terror”. Just two days later, Cheney declared on national television that the US government would have to work through “the dark side” to fight against potential terrorist attacks. In February 2002, arguing that the United States needed “new thinking in the law of war,” President Bush issued an Executive Order denying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners the protections of the Geneva Conventions.  A few  months later, Attorney-General Ashcroft determined that “waterboarding” (pouring water over a constrained prisoner‟s cloth-covered face to induce fear of suffocation) is legal, permitting its use during interrogations of top Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubayda.  This prisoner was ultimately subjected to  waterboarding more than 80 times.  On 1 August 2002, the head of the Office of the Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice, Jay Bybee, sent a memo to the Counsel to the CIA, saying that ten techniques, escalating in force up to waterboarding, did not constitute torture. On the same day, a second memo from the OLC, also signed by Bybee, but written primarily by John Yoo, was sent to the White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales. In implementing the Convention Against Torture, the US Congress had already defined torture narrowly, limiting “torture” which might give rise to criminal prosecution within the US to acts “specifically intended” to cause “severe physical … pain” or “prolonged mental harm.” Yoo sought to limit the concept of torture even further, 15  interpreting the US statute so that only pain “associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions” constituted physical torture.  In October 2002, the commander of the Guantánamo detention site requested authorization of new interrogation techniques, supported by a legal memorandum authored by an inexperienced Staff Judge Advocate, Diane Beaver, who had tried futilely to have her legal opinion checked and corrected by superiors.  Shortly thereafter, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  authorized aggressive interrogation techniques for prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, relying on the legal opinion authored by Beaver. In March 2003 U.S. and Pakistani forces captured the main planner of the 11 September attacks, Kalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times during that month.  In 2003 and 2004, information began to emerge about the treatment of Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees by the US government. The Red Cross issued a rare public statement in October 2003 detailing the deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of detainees at Guantánamo Bay. That same month, photographic evidence was circulated widely over the internet suggesting serious abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The existence of the “torture memos” was revealed in June 2004 by the Washington Post, and the new head of the OLC, Jack Goldsmith, withdraw the August 2002 memo and subsequently resigned.  In February 2005, Alberto Gonzales became the eightieth Attorney General of the United States, and in May the Office of the Legal Counsel sent a new 16  and more comprehensive memo to the CIA Counsel, arguing once again that the techniques of coercive interrogation used by the CIA, including waterboarding, were lawful. This secret memo provided explicit authority to subject detainees to “a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures.” The 2005 Justice Department OLC opinion remained effective throughout the last years of the Bush Administration.  In November 2005 the Washington Post revealed the existence of CIAcontrolled secret detention sites outside the USA, and the CIA destroyed videotapes of the interrogation of “high-value” detainees. President Bush later stopped Congressional attempts to limit CIA interrogation techniques in when, in July 2007, he issued a secret Executive Order authorizing “enhanced” interrogation techniques.  For much of the period from 2001 to 2005, the American public was either unaware or unconcerned about the evolution of U.S. policy on interrogations of terrorist suspects.  Detailed polling results show that the Bush  Administration had, for a time, considerable success first in shielding “harsh” interrogation techniques from public view, and second in convincing many members of the American public that the ill-defined “harsh” techniques were consonant with existing international and domestic law. As The Economist magazine pointed out in 2007, “[t]he 11 September attacks have not driven any rich democracy to reverse itself and make torture legal. But they have encouraged the bending of definitions and the turning of blind eyes.”  17  However, in around 2005 the tide began to turn; public opinion shifted quickly after the revelations of secret detention sites and the abuses at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Declining support for the use of torture against suspected terrorists was manifested in responses to popular media as the decade progressed. Whereas 24 had ridden a wave of support for harsh antiterrorist actions over its first five years on-air, the mood shifted markedly in 2006-2007: Ratings dropped by a third over the course of last year's sixth season.  In a remarkable twist, the Dean of the United States Military  Academy at West Point participated in a 2006 meeting with the writers of 24. According to Jane Mayer of the New Yorker magazine, the Dean argued that the show was promoting “unethical and illegal behavior and had adversely affected the training and performance of real American soldiers.”  Meanwhile, in a number of Western democracies, including the United States, courts were issuing judgments by 2004 that had begun to limit the powers asserted by officials in the prosecution of the War on Terror. The United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the fundamental nature of a citizen‟s right to be free from involuntary confinement by his own government without due process of law in a case concerning a US citizen held as an enemy combatant. The right of habeas corpus was then extended by the Court to foreign nationals held at Guantánamo Bay.  Although the United States Supreme Court has not yet had the opportunity to consider directly the legality of torture within the context of anti-terrorist policies, the UK House of Lords has done so in robust fashion. In a case concerning the admissibility of evidence obtained through suspected torture outside the UK, Lord Hope‟s speech was especially forceful: “[t]he use of 18  such evidence is excluded not on the grounds of its unreliability... but on grounds of its barbarism, its illegality, and its inhumanity. The law will not lend its support to the use of torture for any purpose whatever. It has no place in the defence of freedom and democracy, whose very existence depends on the denial of the use of such methods to the executive.”  It seems that as more time passed after 11 September 2001, Americans became increasingly shaken by the “aggressive” interrogation amounting to torture undertaken in their name. In the words of a former chief prosecutor of the Military Commissions at Guantánamo Bay, who refused to use evidence obtained through waterboarding: “We must restore our reputation as the good guys who refuse to stoop to the level of our adversaries. We are Americans, and we should be able to state with conviction, „We don‟t do stuff like that.‟”  It should not come as any surprise, then, that one of the very first acts of President Obama, only two days after his inauguration, was to issue a series of Executive orders distancing the US government from the practices adopted by the Bush Administration in the War on Terror. As concerns “aggressive” interrogations amounting to torture, the new President specifically repudiated the Yoo-Bybee torture memos.  My story reveals that for the first few years after 11 September 2001, there appears to have been a further eroding of the already weak shared understanding precluding torture. The US Government became an active “norm entrepreneur” in seeking to alter two distinct aspects of the international prohibition on torture: first, that torture was outlawed in all circumstances; and second, that torture could be defined to allow 19  waterboarding and other techniques that did not produce pain equivalent to the spasms of death or “organ failure”.  This norm entrepreneurship  ultimately failed to generate shared understandings to support normative change.  Popular opinion worldwide, and especially in the US, subsequently moved away from relatively broad support for the necessity of torture in combating global terrorism. Indeed, it seems that the Bush Administration, in arguing for an untrammelled right of the President to do “whatever it takes” to fight terrorists, including the de facto authorization of torture, had overreached and created strong pushback across the world, and within America itself. Perhaps ironically, instead of further undermining the weak shared understanding supporting the prohibition on torture that existed in 2001, events over the years after 2005 have ultimately reinforced that shared understanding, potentially making the anti-torture rule stronger.  The next step in our  interactional framework is to ask whether or not the absolute prohibition on torture meets the eight criteria of legality.  The Prohibition on Torture and the Criteria of Legality  The absolute prohibition on torture as exemplified by the United Nations Convention against Torture clearly meets six of Fuller‟s internal requirements of legality. In the book, Brunnée make that argument in detail. Today, I will focus only on the two criteria that present considerable difficulty.  20  One of Fuller‟s eight criteria of legality requires that law be relatively clear; capable of comprehension. Clarity of the rule against torture is a complicated issue. At first blush, the rule is exquisitely clear because it is said to be a blanket prohibition without exception under any circumstances. If that were true, all relevant actors would be able to understand what is permitted, prohibited or required by the law. The difficulty is that there is no commonly accepted definition of what constitutes “severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.” The Torture Convention does not further define these terms; it draws a distinction between torture and other “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.  Implicit in this distinction is the  assumption that there are forms of abusive treatment that do not amount to torture.  The Geneva Conventions ban torture and other forms of  mistreatment, but contain no definition of the term. Nor is there an authoritative definition of torture, beyond the statement of an absolute prohibition, in customary international law or in the practice of the UN Torture Committee.  In attempting to systematically narrow the definition of torture in 2002, a group of US Administration lawyers met with the military leadership at Guantánamo Bay. In minutes of the meeting released to a US Senate hearing, a CIA lawyer is quoted as suggesting that the definition of torture “is basically subject to perception.” He added: “If the detainee dies, you‟re doing it wrong.” In this context of competing and uncertain definitions, the YooBybee torture memos found at least temporary traction. Yoo later suggested that he never doubted that there was a ban on torture, only that the term needed more precise definition. “But,” he asks, “would limiting a captured terrorist to six hours‟ sleep, isolating him, interrogating him for several hours, 21  or requiring him to exercise constitute” suffering amounting to torture? Phrased in this rather anodyne manner, the answer might be “no”. But what if one were closer to the actual practices used on some “high value” detainees at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere? What if the isolation went on for months, even years; if the deprivation of sleep were repeated for days on end? What if the interrogations included threats of anal rape, slaps, the use of pornography, and subjection to extremely loud music for hours at a time?  What if,  interspersed amongst the questions, was repeated waterboarding?  These questions suggest the reason that the international law prohibition is said to be absolute: allowing the use of “aggressive” techniques of interrogation opens up vistas of abuse that may be hard to resist, as the interrogator becomes frustrated with his own failure to generate actionable information; the temptation to go just that one step further to produce results is enormous. In other words, torture may come to seem both necessary and, by steps, normal.  Assessing the criterion of clarity in the face of this conflicting data is difficult. The precise content of the anti-torture norm is uncertain because of the lack of any widely accepted definition of what constitutes “severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental”. However, it is apparent that since 11 September 2001, the conscious efforts made to narrow the definition of torture have been rejected. As soon as the full scope of these efforts became known, they generated intense resistance within the United States and elsewhere.  What  has emerged is a reaffirmation that it is impossible to create acceptable gradations of aggressive interrogation that can be sustained in practice over  22  time. I conclude that the existing prohibition on torture, although not without grey definitional edges, is clear enough to satisfy the criterion of clarity. Fuller‟s final criterion of legality, that there be congruence between legal norms and the actions of officials operating under the law, also presents significant problems.  But let me pause for a moment to emphasise that torture presents an unusual case for the interactional framework because its solidity as a norm has always been weaker that its absolutist formulation would suggest. Because the antitorture norm has no lawful exceptions, it has been hard to uphold; it demands discipline and commitment, often lacking in practice. At every stage of analysis for interactional international law, from an analysis of shared understandings underpinning the norm, to the evaluation of the criteria of legality, to an assessment of the continuing practice of legality supporting the norm, it is the concrete practice of torture that calls into question the reality of the prohibition. So as to avoid repetition, I will therefore blend consideration of congruence, as a criterion of legality, into an investigation of the last step in determining the legal force of the prohibition on torture, deciding whether or not a practice of legality upholds the norm. If there is no such practice, I will also be able to conclude that the final criterion of legality is not met.  Prohibiting Torture and the Practice of Legality  We know that torture has been committed round the world since time immemorial. What concerns us now is the extent to which torture has been committed by state security forces, or with their acquiescence, after 11 23  September 2001. Sadly, evidence of the practice of torture in states around the globe since 2001 could be expounded for far longer than I have time to undertake here. Suffice it to note that the report of the Arar Commission in Canada, demonstrates that torture is routinely practiced in Syrian detention centres, especially in Far Falestine. The Agiza case from Sweden reveals similar patterns of torture in Egypt.  Russian security forces have been  implicated in torture, especially in the context of suppressing Chechen rebels. Credible reports from global human rights NGOs suggest that the Chinese government has authorized or tolerated the torture of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang province.  Pakistan, until very recently a favoured ally in the War on Terror, is reported by major human rights organizations to practice torture in many locations across the country. Iranian authorities use torture to stifle dissent. For Uzbek security forces, torture is a routine means of extracting confessions to be used in criminal trials. In Myannmar, torture is used to further repression of all dissent. Torture also seems to be a routine practice in North Korea, again as an instrument of control. Torture exists as well in sub-Saharan Africa, with reliable reports of torture practiced by security forces or their agents in Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and The Gambia. Even in Latin America, where enormous political and legal efforts have been made to move away from the abuses of authoritarian regimes in the 1970s and 80s, torture continues to be employed by some security forces, with credible reports emerging from Mexico, Venezuala, and Paraguay.  Equally disturbing is evidence of the complicity of Western security forces in torture committed in secret detention sites in various locations around the 24  globe. In a report to the Human Rights Commission in February 2004, the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, which I then chaired, identified a disturbing trend in the War on Terror. The Working Group had begun to receive credible information revealing the existence of secret detention centres in several countries. These centres were said to exist in the developing world, but it appeared that they were created at the behest of other governments, especially that of the United States of America.  In November 2005, the Washington Post published a powerful piece of investigative journalism linking many of the dots, and revealing that ghost prisons may have existed in eight countries including some EU member states in Eastern Europe and candidate countries for EU membership. President Bush formally acknowledged the existence of secret detention sites run by the CIA in 2006. In a televised speech, he revealed that in these secret prisons “an alternative set of procedures” was used to obtain information from terrorist suspects.  Secret detention is ripe for abuse; hiding people makes them especially vulnerable. There is now ample evidence in the public domain that abusive interrogation, amounting to torture, has taken place in these ghost prisons. In August 2009, the CIA released a 2004 report by the CIA Inspector General that was highly critical of techniques used in some interrogations. These techniques included mock executions, used to terrify other terrorist suspects, a threat to kill the children of at least one detainee, suggestions about sexually assaulting members of a detainee‟s family, employment of the “hard takedown,” where a detainee was seized and thrown to the floor before being  25  moved to a sleep-deprivation cell, and at least one instance of a threat with a gun and a power drill.  Thanks to powerful investigative journalism, the existence of access to information legislation in Western democracies, and the change of Administration in the USA, it is possible to conclude that torture was committed in secret detention facilities operated by or in cooperation with US security forces. Other Western intelligence agencies seem to have colluded in torture as well.  In considering whether a practice of legality existed after 11 September 2001 to support the absolute prohibition on torture, it would seem that the answer is no. Torture is practiced in all regions of the globe, and it has been sanctioned even by western democracies. Were this conclusion to stand unvarnished, a further implication would be that the last criteria of legality, that official action must mesh with a purported rule of law, would not be met. On two grounds, then, breaching a criterion of legality and failing to find a continuing practice of legality, the absolute prohibition on torture would not qualify as interactional international law.  However, my final assessment must be more nuanced because the practices of torture since 11 September 2001 are increasingly under scrutiny, at least as they implicate Western intelligence services, and strong evidence is emerging that a reassertion of the absolute prohibition may be underway. Even in the darkest days after the September 11 attacks, rays of light were penetrating the cells of secret detention. A number of former FBI and ex-CIA agents, retired military leaders, and some members of the US government and military legal 26  services, spoke out strongly against secret detention and torture. A recently retired general counsel of the United States Navy, Alberto J. Mora, was particularly forthright:  If cruelty is no longer declared unlawful, but instead is applied as a matter of policy, it alters the fundamental relationship of man to government. It destroys the whole notion of individual rights.  As early as 2007, senior members of the US Congress had also begun publicly to question the use of secret detention and the attendant likelihood of abuse.  In one of his very first acts, President Obama announced that he would overturn the Bush-era Executive Order authorizing “harsh” interrogation techniques.  The President also ordered the review of secret detention  facilities, looking for lawful options for detention. The current US Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the actions of US officials who may have committed torture.  Meanwhile a Parliamentary  inquiry into complicity with torture has been launched in the UK, and in Canada compensation has been given to a victim of torture in Syria after a public inquiry into the role of Canadian officials in extraordinary rendition from the US to Syria.  The practice of legality on the prohibition of torture has been in a state of movement since 11 September 2001. Torture was taking place around the globe, and was even being used or connived in by liberal democracies, most notably by the most important global actor, the United States. Yet the tide 27  has shifted. Disgust over the use of torture seems to be reasserting itself both amongst Western governments and in the public. Concrete steps are being taken to reverse the trends towards the direct use and political toleration of torture. In the United States especially, since the coming into office of the Obama Administration, reassertions of the traditional ban on torture are being made regularly. However, it cannot be said that the undermining of the prohibition has been completely reversed. It is not yet the case that secret detention has been precluded by Executive Order in the US, nor that all forms of “torture lite” are excluded from the arsenal of US interrogators. It must also be admitted that torture is continuing in many states around the globe, and does not seem to be a particular priority for global action.  Conclusion  The case of torture points to both the robustness of the interactional analysis of international law and to the hard-headed approach that the analysis demands. Quite frankly, I am not at all comfortable with the conclusion to which our analysis draws us in relation to the prohibition on torture, but I am firmly convinced that the analysis is nonetheless reasonable and accurate.  In evaluating the underlying global shared understandings supporting the absolute prohibition on torture contained in the UN Torture Convention I conclude that the understandings were weak before 11 September 2001. In an intriguing twist, the shared understandings were initially further undermined in the few years immediately following Osama bin Laden‟s attacks; however, by 2006, the revulsion that attended disclosures of Western, and especially  28  US, government complicity in torture began to reinforce a shared understanding precluding the use of torture in all circumstances.  It is clear that the attempts made in the Yoo-Bybee memos and subsequent actions of high-ranking US officials to explicitly narrow the definition of torture did not succeed. They did not generate widely shared understandings; indeed they were actively resisted by senior US military and security officials, US allies, the media, NGOs, and the general public.  It remains sadly true that when one considers the eighth criterion of legality, congruence of official action with a posited norm, there is strong evidence that torture is routinely practiced all around the globe in the name of national security, and sometimes simply to extract confessions in criminal proceedings. The complicity, or direct action, of Western security agencies in “harsh” interrogations amounting to torture also undermined this criterion of legality in the period after 11 September 2001. The same data, credibly reported by NGO and official sources, leads to the further conclusion that we lack a robust practice of legality continuing to support the absolute prohibition on torture.  My provisional conclusion is that the absolute  prohibition on torture does not meet the standards of interactional international law. The rule is rhetorically strong but practically weak; it does not truly shape the behaviour of scores, perhaps the majority, of states. I call this a “provisional” conclusion because the situation is fluid, and there is good evidence to suggest that we are living through a period of normative transition as concerns the anti-torture rule. The reassertion of a robust shared understanding that the prohibition on torture is necessary, and that it should 29  be absolute, is building. The practice of the United States is undergoing a profound re-evaluation, and this may prove globally relevant, especially amongst liberal democracies. What remains uncertain is whether there is a strong normative impulse to confront and challenge the practices of torture that seem endemic in so many states around the globe. If torture continues to be widely employed without any significant international legal and political consequences in scores of states, it will be difficult to assert that the eighth criterion of legality is met or that a practice of legality supports the antitorture norm.  The rule prohibiting torture is a fascinating example of why I argue so strenuously that the work of international law is not done with the positing of a rule in a “binding” convention.  Rules are constructed, buttressed or  destroyed through the continuing practice of states and other international actors. In the case of human rights norms, like the anti-torture rule, the work of non-state actors, particularly NGOs and the media, is particularly necessary and powerful. So the most important conclusion to draw from an interactional analysis of the prohibition of torture is that the struggle to maintain the norm is never over. It is necessary to redouble efforts to challenge the practice of torture in scores of states around the world. If that work is not undertaken successfully, the formal existence of an absolute prohibition on torture could still become a dead letter. Can law prevent torture? Yes, but only if together we keep working at it. i  Based on J. Brunnée and S.J.Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapters 1-3 and 5.

1.0107493~Vancouver Board of Trade Speech, 2010~Toope, Stephen J.~VANCOUVER BOARD OF TRADE Go Global with UBC: Make Your ‘Local’ University Your International Business Partner September 15, 2010—Hyatt Regency Hotel  [conversational …]  Thanks, Lindsay [Gordon, HSBC], and thank you all for this opportunity to be with you again. It‘s an honour and a pleasure. I‘ve got this big topic of internationalism I want to talk about with you today, but my message actually isn‘t a complicated one, and in fact I‘m going to start with a little story.  I stopped by the office of my Vice-President of Finance a few weeks ago, and as we were talking, I noticed a book on the desk behind him that caught my eye. Someone had obviously given it to him as a gift when he left his home in Europe and come to North America, or maybe when he left his position as VP Finance with Best Buy International to join our team at UBC. But that was early 2009, so I was surprised I hadn‘t noticed it before. What caught my eye was the type of book it was, the graphics on the cover, the  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 22  name of the author. This author, a doctor, didn‘t earn his PhD at UBC … or anywhere, actually. You see … it was Dr. Seuss.  The book is called, Oh, The Places You’ll Go! You might know it. People give it to high school or university grads, or to someone who‘s just started a new job. Like The Cat in the Hat, or Green Eggs and Ham, it has colourful illustrations with wild characters, and of course everything rhymes. Seeing it reminded me of the times I had read it to my children. You know what, it‘s good! It‘s especially good because you can read it as a fun kids‘ story about a character who gets up to all kinds of adventures, or, as an adult, as a message about what to expect – good and bad – when you push yourself way out of your comfort zone.  I‘m sure Pierre had no idea of ‗the places he‘d go,‘ when he left the private sector and found himself at the financial helm of an institution the size of a small city just as the worst global financial crisis in recent memory was gathering steam. He was suddenly in charge of Finance and Treasury and Land and Building Services and Campus and Community Planning … and where he went—with a leap that his previous training and experience had only partly prepared him for—was ―sustainability.‖ Economic, quickly  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 22  stabilizing and conserving in a way that many other post-secondary institutions were unable to do; environmental, so that now delegations from all over the world come to learn how it is that our greenhouse gas emissions will be zero by 2050; and social, where the campus and surrounding community are being transformed into a true university town that supports students, staff, faculty, and university and non-university residents alike.  I had no idea of ‗the places I’d go‘ when I left the Trudeau Foundation for UBC. I‘ve made nine trips to six different countries since January first. That‘s just this year, and the year‘s not over yet! One of the key elements of my job is to nurture UBC‘s 300-plus formal partnerships with institutions and organizations around the world, and to forge new ones. Our goal is a UBC that‘s recognized around the world as a global hub for study, research, partnership, and dialogue on the key issues of the day, and although we still have a lot of work to do, I‘m excited that in many countries, that is already the way we‘re known.  I guess I‘m just surprised by how right Dr. Seuss got it. When I think of Dr. Seuss, I think ‗familiar,‘ I think ‗comforting,‘ but I think ‗children.‘ Not adults, not me. It‘s easy to forget that he wrote over 60 books translated into  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 22  15 languages with over 200 million copies sold worldwide. His books have been millions of young people‘s first encounter with the ideas of environmentalism, anti-consumerism, racial equality, anti-fascism, and internationalism. Not kids‘ stuff at all.  There‘s a verse in the middle of Oh, The Places You’ll Go! that I especially liked for today, where the way forward is suddenly not clear. It reads: You will come to a place where the streets are not marked. Some windows are lighted. But mostly they’re darked. A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin! Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in? How much can you lose? How much can you win? To go or not to go, that is the question. Or is it? My answer, my message today is a really simple one: We are all too interconnected now—you, and me, and the flood victims in Pakistan, the entrepreneurs in China, the HIV sufferers in Africa, and the financiers in New York—too interconnected, and too interdependent to pretend any longer that we can just stay home and mind our own business. It‘s no longer a question of whether you go international; it‘s a question of when. The marketplace—for everything—is global, and our competitors and our collaborators are everywhere. We have  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 22  to be international, all of us, large or small, in our thinking, in our strategies, and in our operations.  As a country, this is an area where we‘re lagging dangerously behind. The striving and the ambition, the innovation and the sense of urgency I see in places like India and China are not apparent here. We lack a national strategy, something the ‗big five‘ universities are pushing for with both government and industry, and it needs to happen soon.  I spoke recently with BC Business Magazine editor Matt O‘Grady, and he said that BC companies doing business overseas are the exception rather than the rule. He quoted a particularly eloquent senior trade commissioner as saying, ―The biggest obstacle … is getting small- to medium-sized … companies to make that first tentative step …. If you want to be a global player you‘ve got to get off your ass.‖  I‘m not so sure it‘s a question of wanting to be a global player or not. The desire is there. I‘m more inclined to agree with Dan Muzyka, Dean of UBC‘s Sauder School of Business, when he says in one of his regular Globe  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 22  & Mail columns1 that the primary reason companies don‘t move forward is fear of risk. Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in? How much can you lose? How much can you win? He adds, though, that not taking the risk may be the biggest risk of all.  This past Saturday marked the anniversary of an event that changed the way North Americans think about the world, and especially about the notions of security and risk. But the current economic crisis tells me we have yet to learn all the lessons of that event. In a book called The Age of the Unthinkable, author Joshua Cooper Ramo, a former managing editor of TIME Magazine and now managing director of Kissinger Associates says there‘s no predicting global dynamics, no mastering the environment. What it comes down to is resilience.  Security is no longer about the size of your military, or your bank account, and it‘s certainly not about certainty. It‘s more like an immune system: the ability to respond; a comfort with uncertainty and an appetite for change, even revolutionary change. It‘s the ability to create and innovate. An ability  1  ―Commercialize or calcify,‖ August 16, 2010.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 22  to empathize with whatever and whomever you consider ‗other.‘ And it‘s an instinct for looking deeply at the world—a quality more suited to a university than, say, a Tweetup.  We‘re all ‗international,‘ whether or not we yet think of ourselves that way. And the other part of my message today is that UBC can help, in a number of very practical and very profound ways. Today is about inviting you, encouraging you, to take advantage of UBC. It‘s your university! One of the three reasons UBC exists, alongside learning, and research excellence, is to be of service. I think we often do a better job of letting you know when we need your help and support and contributions, and not such a good job of letting you know all the ways we‘re here for you. So that‘s the message I want you to take away with you today. And if you also happen to take away an idea about how we can help, an idea you can act on, then I‘ll have done what I hoped to do at the Vancouver Board of Trade.  With a challenge as daunting and complex as internationalizing your business, UBC may not have been the first place you thought of turning to for answers. After all, it‘s the campus on the Point, part of the Vancouver backdrop, the place where your or your neighbour‘s kids go to school, where  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 22  you get your 100-Mile organic veggies on Saturday mornings, or where that fabulous museum is that you take your out-of-town guests to. Or maybe it‘s the ol‘ Ivory Tower, a kind of Harry-Potter-at-Hogwarts freeze frame in your mind‘s eye, owls and all.  If you think of UBC as any of these things, you‘re right (well, except for the owls). But you‘re only partly right. Just the way you‘d be partly right to say that Wendy [Lisogar-Cocchia] has a nail bar up the street. Or that Jason [McLean] heads up a mom-and-pop operation. Or Lindsay [Gordon] runs the savings and loan around the corner.  All true. But it‘s also true that Absolute Spa Group has opened 11 locations in 11 years, won three international awards, and now distributes its Soluzione spa products to resorts worldwide. That the McLean Group of Companies deals in international real estate, film production services, telecommunications, and aviation, and is one of the top exporters in BC. That HSBC Bank Canada is part of the world‘s largest banking and financial services group and the 8th largest company in the world. And that all three do tremendous philanthropic work in the community.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 9 of 22  What about The University of British Columbia? With more global partnerships, international programs, and multi-national research projects; more personnel – students, staff, faculty, and alumni – overseas; more international students and faculty, than any other British Columbia organization. Ranked among the top 40 in the world in the post-secondary equivalent of the Fortune 500. With a hundred years of intercultural exploration, through law, international relations, anthropology, languages, and business. You want to benefit from somebody else‘s mistakes, take ours! The lessons we‘ve learned through a century of study and on-the-ground experience infuse every course we offer. UBC is a destination of choice for literally thousands of brilliant students and accomplished scholars from all over the world—and I‘m not talking Vancouver here but UBC specifically— and every one of them is prepared to bring their unique talents and skills, and their networks of connections here with them.  What may look like an Ivory Tower in our hometown looks like a beacon of opportunity and innovation in China, Mexico, England, Iran, Germany, India, Japan. Just like William Shatner, Pamela Anderson, and Mike Myers, maybe we‘ve had to make our reputation abroad before we could be fully  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 10 of 22  appreciated here at home. But I want UBC to be that kind of beacon for you, too.  There are three broad categories, three things I think UBC has to offer a business in BC that‘s looking to internationalize in some way. The first thing we have to offer is MINDS—or what‘s commonly called talent; the second is IMMERSION—or the chance to try on different aspects of internationalizing before you take the risk, especially around intercultural relations; and the third is IDEAS—ideas UBC researchers generate that you can use, and ideas you generate that UBC can help you develop. Minds, Immersion, and Ideas. I‘d like to spend the remainder of my time with you exploring these three potential points of partnership between UBC and the business community. And I‘m looking forward to hearing your questions and ideas.  Minds Kaushik Anand left home without knowing when he‘d see his family again, and with a group of other young students, all of them strangers to one another, moved into a hostel in Madras, India. For a year, he spent every waking hour studying for the JEE, or Joint Entrance Exam, dreaming of the  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 11 of 22  opportunities a post-secondary education could give him. Then, along with over 200,000 others, he sat for the exam. One of the lucky (read: brilliant) ones, Kaushik earned a place at the India Institute of Technology—or IIT— Madras.  It was there that he learned of a program called MITACS Globalink, which places the very best Indian undergraduate students in top research universities in BC, Ontario, and New Brunswick. Students who win a spot in Globalink work with local business people while conducting research under a global expert in their field. Kaushik made it to UBC.  ―The networking events, industrial visits, and skills enhancement workshops differentiate [Globalink] from other internship programs,‖ Kaushik says. ―I am thankful to MITACS, UBC, and the Province of British Columbia for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.‖  It‘s being hailed as ―the brain gain,‖ or ―the great brain race.‖2 The most brilliant researchers internationally now exhibit a global brand mentality  2  The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World, by Ben Wildavsky.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 12 of 22  when it comes to choosing where they‘ll work, and the world‘s brightest students are doing the same.  The choices scholars are making have transformed post-secondary education from a largely local practice to a global one, characterized by fluidity, mobility, and meritocracy. International education has become a form of free trade, where the ―goods and supplies‖ of the knowledge economy are these phenomenal minds, and the currency is ideas.  The competition is such that BC‘s Provincial Government has taken a leadership role by branding British Columbia education abroad from kindergarten through grade 12. Over 5,900 students in China, Egypt, Thailand, South Korea, and India are currently enrolled in the BC curriculum, and their graduation certificate will be the Dogwood.  Developing countries are scrambling to hang onto their best and brightest by building opportunities at home. In China, for example, the government spent $4.4 billion on 40 leading universities from 1999 to 2005 in an effort to vault them into the top tier, and their number of undergrad and graduate degrees quadrupled.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 13 of 22  What‘s important for you to know is that UBC is already in that top tier. In addition to the 30 Globalink students and other interns we host each year, in 2009 UBC was the top choice for 6,800 full-time international students from 142 different countries. Enough to fill some of the labour gaps we‘re starting to see, if all of us together can find ways to convince them to stay.  We call UBC a place of mind. One reason is the freedom researchers are accorded to pursue their flights of the imagination, their leaps of logic, that currency of ideas. Those open, supportive conditions attract the best researchers from around the world, who in turn help draw the top students, and who together produce the ―next, next thing.‖  Here are just a few more examples of UBC as an international talent hub, and a place of mind.  Matthew Farrer leaves the Mayo Clinic in Florida in May to become UBC‘s first Canada Excellence Research Chair in Neurogenetics and Translational Neuroscience, a $10 million dollar award. Already, researchers and graduate students are clamouring to join him in the search for solutions to the brain  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 14 of 22  diseases, disorders, and injuries that affect nearly a third of this country‘s population.  In August, the new ―entrepreneurship@UBC‖ program sends six companies—three student and three alumni—to Silicon Valley‘s Plug and Play technology centre, an uber-accelerator for 300 companies that are innovating around the clock. They make their pitches to the C100: a hundred successful Canadian CEOs, CFOs, and CTOs working in the Valley, several of whom are UBC alumni and all of whom are looking to give back. Now, UBC, the City of Vancouver, and other regional players are looking to create a Plug and Play right here.  Rio Tinto CEO Tom Albanese and geologist/entrepreneur Ross Beaty are helping spearhead the creation of a new training facility for geologists and scientists here in the mineral exploration capital of the world. The new Earth Systems Science Building at UBC will draw students and faculty from countries around the globe, including Mongolia, Australia, and South America, and graduates will help fill the need for 60,000 new skilled workers in mining and oil in the coming decade.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 15 of 22  If the minds you‘re looking to hire reside in people who have a foot in two worlds, speak multiple languages, have worked with researchers and entrepreneurs and financiers before they graduate, and can hit the ground running, look to UBC.  Immersion Within UBC Continuing Studies is a well-kept secret whose time has come. It‘s called the Centre for Intercultural Communication, and it offers programs such as Diversity in the Workplace and Preparation for International Assignments, as well as a Certificate in Intercultural Studies, that are targeted specially to the business community. In operation since 1982 and with a staff of 32 specialists from all over the world, the CIC‘s client list includes post-secondaries such as Royal Roads University and the University of Toronto; government and non-profit organizations; and international firms including HSBC Bank Canada, Korea Telecomm, and YVR Vancouver Airport Services.  If one of the stumbling blocks to internationalizing your business is a fear of saying, doing, or hearing the wrong thing, I get it! Cultural misunderstandings can kill an international venture and can cost you a lot,  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 16 of 22  both in dollars and reputation. What the CIC programs allow you to do is immerse yourself in that ‗foreign‘ culture, but without the risk.  At this point, I want to acknowledge that not every BC business needs to open a branch office in Asia. There are lots of ways to internationalize, where having a broad range of perspectives, a new awareness of your own beliefs and attitudes, and a specific set of skills and strategies will help. It might be marketing your product internationally via the Web. Or finding a distributor or retail markets overseas. It might be making your business more attractive to those elite students I talked about—the international ones and our home-educated global citizens—or to an untapped market locally. It might even be providing the time and resources for your staff to contribute to international development projects. Whatever the case, the immersion opportunities available at the CIC can make your business more resilient.  Here are two more entry points into UBC that can give you this kind of immersion advantage.  The Office of the Vice-President Research and International, or VPRI, maintains a wide range of contacts with Vancouver-based Consulates,  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 17 of 22  Embassies and High Commissions of foreign governments in Ottawa. They also have links with Canadian diplomats abroad. If you‘re interested in engaging UBC‘s diplomatic contacts, get in touch with the VPRI for contact details, introductions, and advice on how best to use the network.  And if it‘s deep immersion you‘re after, go work in Shanghai … and earn a UBC MBA at the same time. The 20-month International MBA, run by Sauder School of Business in partnership with the Antai College of Economics and Management at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, features senior UBC faculty and an award-winning curriculum.  If you‘re looking for a safe place to make your mistakes, we‘re just up the street. We‘ve seen them all. We‘ve made them all! And we can help.  Ideas J.J. Liou was a politician in Taiwan, and a businessman in Taiwan, Japan, and here in BC. His son still runs the Nicola Valley Cattle Ranch. In 1970, J.J. took his mother to the Osaka Expo, where the theme was Progress and Harmony for Mankind. The sight of the world‘s nations coming together for such a reason made an impression that has lasted to this day. In the late  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 18 of 22  1980s, he approached then-UBC President David Strangway with an idea: Let‘s find a way to bring people together in dialogue to further the ideals of harmony and peace.  In September of 2000, UBC‘s Liu Institute for Global Issues opened its doors to scholars, students, entrepreneurs, and citizens from all over the world to talk about health, the environment, poverty, war … and peace. J.J. is in a wheelchair now, but when we visit he still ponders how to bring people together. He has said that of all the places he‘s been where there is a mix of people from different cultures, BC is the place of greatest harmony. He hopes the Liu Centre and UBC will be able to extend this harmony to other regions and nations.  The means by which we internationalize, whether we‘re a business, a university, or an individual, is through ideas. Your business began as an idea, and it‘s through a constant infusion of new ideas that it‘s able to grow. With access to literally a world of ideas, in the form of cutting-edge research, multi-national collaborations, and effective commercialization channels, UBC can help you connect to ideas that will drive your business to the next level.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 19 of 22  Or maybe it‘s your idea that‘s looking for an outlet, like J.J.‘s was, an idea that needs some R&D, some fresh insight, an infusion of energy to power it forward. Before you start recruiting researchers or buying test equipment or breaking ground, call us. UBC brought in over $546 million dollars in research funding last year, and many of those dollars are designated for strategic partnerships with industry.  Here are a few examples of ideas that grew from small seeds to significant scope with support from UBC.  In our quest for zero GHG emissions by 2050, UBC partnered with Nexterra Systems Corporation, a local biomass gasification company, to install a combined-heat-and-power system on the Vancouver campus. The system will save enough electricity to power 1,500 homes, and reduce GHG emissions by up to 4,500 tonnes per year—the equivalent of taking 1,100 cars off the road. The project of turning UBC into a living research laboratory so interested international powerhouse General Electric that GE asked to be part of the partnership. Not bad for a local start-up!  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 20 of 22  Doug Goldenberg of UBC‘s Earth and Ocean Sciences department has been working for 20 years to create models and methods for detecting sub-surface anomalies in the earth. His technologies have had massive impact in mineral and oil exploration, and attracted a great number of transnational geophysics corporations whose reach exceeds 40 countries. The technology can also be used—is also being used—to detect unexploded land mines. What could your company do with it?  In 2007, a group of students led UBC to become the first university in Canada to develop a policy for ensuring global access to its technologies, particularly in health care and environmental sustainability. In 2009, the policy led to the development of the Neglected Global Diseases Initiative. Funding for health research tends to focus on first-world diseases, and yet infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis kill millions of people, including children, in poor and marginalized areas, even though effective treatments already exist. The Initiative attracted the attention, and the support, of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and has begun to save lives. Is international development part of your passion?  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 21 of 22  Simon K.Y. Lee had the idea of creating a second home at UBC for students, professors, and researchers who are visiting from abroad, and established the Simon K.Y. Lee Hong Kong University-UBC House.  Tom and Caleb Chan had an idea for bringing the University and the community closer together. Their idea took the shape of a landmark concert hall that is home to symphony, opera, theatre, dance, jazz, classical, and world music almost every night of the year.  Bob Lee had the idea of making UBC secure into the future, and created UBC Properties Trust to perpetually strengthen the University‘s endowment.  C.K. Choi, who was never able to attend university himself, established UBC‘s Institute for Asian Research, which has become one of the strongest Asian Studies programs in North America. When UBC awarded him an honourary degree, his words to the audience were these: ―Work hard for the common good. It is what life is all about.‖ Now, there’s a good idea.  Vancouver Board of Trade Annual Address Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 22 of 22  Conclusion And so may I simply say in conclusion … Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in? How much can you lose? How much can you win? When you’re alone, there’s a very good chance you’ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants. There are some, down the road between hither and yon, that can scare you so much you won’t want to go on. But wait! Here‘s a partner who‘s been there before, with whom you can practice, and practice some more. A partner who brings the best minds to your door, and supports your inventions with research galore! Oh, the places you‘ll go … now‘s the time, don‘t you see? You don‘t have to go solo … you‘ve got UBC!  Thank you. Thank you very much.  -30-  
1.0102612~Vancouver Board of Trade Speech : conspiring to change the world for the better~Toope, Stephen J.~Vancouver Board of Trade Conspiring to Change the World for the Better 14 September 2011 – Fairmont Waterfront Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Thank you, everyone, for this opportunity to be here with you once again. Our annual lunch date is one of the high points of my calendar. I warmly remember how you welcomed me as a newcomer to Vancouver, and I have enjoyed these opportunities to speak and to listen, to identify the strong areas of shared purpose and vision, and especially to discuss how we might work together to accomplish shared goals – a topic I especially want to address today. I feel that the maturing of our relationship over the past six years reflects mutual respect and understanding of the bonds that exist between this most influential of business associations and my university, the University of British Columbia.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 2 of 20  We, like you, are economic agents. You may have heard me speak of the fact that UBC accounts for some $10 billion dollars of annual economic impact in British Columbia. Our reputation among the world’s top universities draws a tremendous pool of highly valuable talent to this province, and the excellence that this standing indicates enables us to prepare you, your children and your employees for careers on a global stage. Our faculty and students are conducting hands-on practical research relevant to every industry you can think of in just about every corner of Vancouver, British Columbia and the world. We have facilities in hospitals, forests, aboriginal reserves, urban neighborhoods, media production studios, and right downtown at Robson Square which you executive MBAs may be quite familiar with. We have more than 13,000 people on the payroll. We manage an operation the size of a city of 50,000. We are not a business, but we have a lot of experience dealing with similar issues, and working closely with businesses and other institutions like yours. To be honest, there have been times in the past when I felt I was confronting a very persistent myth of UBC as an Ivory Tower. I hope I’ve made headway in this regard, but frankly I wouldn’t be surprised  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 3 of 20  if some skepticism still existed in this room regarding the relevance of my university to real-world enterprise. That’s OK. I understand. Our relationship is still growing. It’s been six years now and I feel that, in the spirit of our friendship, I can now be completely honest with you. Today, I’ve decided that based on our strong relationship I can come clean once and for all and tell the truth: We are not an Ivory Tower. UBC is, in fact, a leader of a vast and powerful conspiracy to change the world as we know it. There. I’ve said it. Now, before my fellow legal professionals get too excited, let me stress that this is not a criminal conspiracy I’m referring to. When I use the word “conspire” I mean it in its original Latin sense — con  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 4 of 20  spire -—com spirare: To breathe together. Nothing necessarily sinister about that. Nothing terribly clandestine about it either, for ours is not a secret conspiracy. It’s actually a very open, public and transparent conspiracy. It is a breathing-together with this express purpose: to make powerful, practical, transformational changes in our environment, in our society, in our wellbeing, in our economy and yes, in your life and in the way you do business. I’m not saying that we’ve been doing this while being “under the cover” of an ivory tower. While some may have laboured under that misconception, this conspiracy has been going on for some time, and it is proving to be of great benefit to our co-conspirators, of whom I am happy to say there are many in this room. (You know who you are). I plan to introduce you to a few of them today. And for those of you who are not co-conspirators, you should be. And I'm here to invite you in, using a not-at-all-secret handshake. You may have noticed that today’s lunch was billed as a talk about partnerships that can transform our world.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 5 of 20  So what’s with this conspiracy theory? For one thing, I hope I got your attention. And for another I want to draw your attention to a distinction that I think is important. The word “partner” is a great one. But these days, it can be used in so many fuzzy ways. A partner could be a title in a firm, or it could refer to one person romantically connected to another, or in cowboy style it could just be “howdy pardner.” It’s too easy, in my opinion, to think of partnerships just as relationships without necessarily focusing on what those relationships are for. But when we conspire together—when we breathe together—there is a powerful emphasis on the purpose. That purpose involves some kind of real change or real accomplishment. There is a risk and a benefit. You’ve got skin in the game. Failure can bring real consequences. What is our purpose?  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 6 of 20  Well our highest purpose is not to bestow certificates prized by employers (though the skills, knowledge and capabilities represented by those pieces of parchment are invaluable in your world and mine). Nor is it even to support a collection of eminent, independentminded professors (though the academic freedom they exercise differentiates the nature of their research from that which you can buy from the private sector). Our highest purpose – the fundamental reason we exist or should exist — is to change the world for the better. And if I can be so bold as to say it, that is also the fundamental reason your company exists, or should exist, too. By adding value, realizing competitive advantage, innovating, solving problems, providing benefits, you change the world; and you, yourselves, can prosper. Dominic Barton is the global managing director of McKinsey and Company and he’s also a UBC graduate. In the Harvard Business Review recently he wrote an article entitled “Capitalism for the Long  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 7 of 20  Term” in which he expressed well how and why we share an interest in transformation. He said “Myopia plagues Western institutions in every sector. “ He calls for changing how we view business’s value and role in society. And he bluntly suggests why we must do that: we can reform the system or we can let the system be reformed for us. In our university we are trained to resist myopia. But we are nevertheless constantly challenged to be an active rather than a passive agent in this changing world. I believe we share this common challenge. Why do we conspire? We conspire because we have learned that the best way to accomplish real, meaningful things that truly change the world for the better is to join forces. As a university, we have three powerful capabilities; and over the centuries, the mission of universities has evolved to emphasise them. One is to preserve and transmit knowledge through education. Another is to create new knowledge through research. And the third  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 8 of 20  is to actively serve our many communities as good neighbors and citizens. Optimizing these three capabilities requires a delicate balance that demands constant calibration. We must be a “part of” the world in which we live and also to some extent “apart from” it. Education can’t usefully be dictated by popular trends, but it has to be relevant to current conditions. To use management biz-speak, we need to know what’s in the box in order to think usefully outside of it. If we come too close, we lose our perspective. If we pull too far back, we lose our responsiveness (and this is where a university does risk becoming an ivory tower). Our strategy for achieving our purpose and maintaining this balance has always been to identify and hold firmly to our core values as an institution. But once we’ve done that, we at UBC have increasingly realized that we don’t necessarily have to do things just because that’s the way we’ve always done them. We jealously guard our freedom to teach and to learn. We honour our commitments and we assert our responsibilities in society. But after that, everything else is open. Everything.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 9 of 20  Classwork with real-world impact in neighborhoods out of the classroom. Research, development and demonstrations of technology in collaboration with government and private business. Global agreements that share resources and initiatives with other influential institutions around the world. Community service learning. Learning exchanges. Co-op work programs. Mentorships. Startup incubators. Infrastructure investments. Joint ventures. Executive learning. Distance Education. Learning exchanges. International MBAs. Vast conspiracies everywhere you look. UBC has more than 300 formal agreements with institutions and organizations around the world. More than enough to cause a glut in frequent flyer miles. But that’s just a hint at the enormity of these conspiracies. There are, right now, thousands of people breathing together to make meaningful change in more ways than I can possibly detail to you during a considerate lunchtime conversation.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 10 of 20  But I want you to know about them, and I want you to locate your own best interests within these conspiracies. So I’ve prepared a little writeup listing some of the ones that I think will intrigue you the most. It’s here for you to look at later today. That should give us some time to do what I’ve not done here before but have always wanted to do, which is to share the spotlight with some of UBC’s notable collaborators/associates. It’s one thing for me to talk about how good it is for UBC to join forces with others to accomplish things, but I think it’s much more useful for you to hear from others what that’s like. The first person with whom I’d like to share the mic is Janet Austin, Chief Executive Officer of the YWCA of Metro Vancouver. UBC and the YWCA have been working together for several years to make a difference in the Downtown Eastside. And a number of our students have taken advantage of Community Service Learning and Community-based Research programs as part of their studies. The YWCA has a rooftop garden that they converted from an ornamental space to an organic food garden, which includes a mini  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 11 of 20  orchard. The produce from this garden goes into to the kitchen of the Crabtree Corner Community where it helps feed women and their families in the Downtown Eastside. Ask anyone who’s tasted them, the fresh vegetables and fruit that come from this garden are really good, in addition, of course, to doing good. One of our students, Eamonn Watson, got connected with the YWCA through an undergraduate course in Land and Food Systems. His efforts helped the YWCA optimize its soil management and composting practices as well as helped them realize a mini-orchard in the space. Another student—Dennis Fan studying in Applied Sciences—worked with the YWCA to design and build a grey water filtration system for the garden. Today I understand that garden is on the way to yielding one tonne of organic food each growing cycle, and all of it operated and managed by volunteers from the Downtown Eastside. Janet, would you say a few words? [Janet Austin speaks to the good that’s come from this ongoing relationship between UBC and the YWCA, giving a sense for how this strategic partnership has helped her organization, simply, to do more. Through these initiatives, residents of the Downtown Eastside  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 12 of 20  are making a positive impact on their own community, helping them feel a part of something meaningful.] Thanks Janet. It’s an honour to work with you and the people in your community. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s highly possible that you’re not involved in urban gardening, or that your business is not located in the Downtown Eastside. But every business is sensitively dependent on the social “ecosystem” of the communities in which it operates and which it serves. In pursuing these projects outside of the classroom— engaging with living, breathing, real-world organizations such as the YWCA—our students have developed skills and awareness in community consultation that will benefit any business they work with, not to mention the communities they work in. The next working relationship I want to highlight with you is one that is going to help UBC achieve its goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and help Nexterra Systems Corporation, the Vancouver-based clean energy startup, launch itself onto the world stage. The initiator of this joint venture was Jonathan Rhone,  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 13 of 20  Nexterra’s CEO. Aware of our commitments to sustainability, it was Jon who approached UBC with a proposal that we incorporate a new biomass gasification system into our campus infrastructure to use local wood waste to generate heat and electricity. The concept made shockingly good financial sense, and it fit beautifully into our research agenda; but it required us to change how we manage our infrastructure and rethink our policies about intellectual property. Remember what I said about holding fast to our values but being open to changing everything else? That’s what happened here. This project helped us restructure our policies to better reflect the realities of working with startups, specifically as it relates to ownership of intellectual property. Working together to realize the Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Project are the City of Vancouver (supplying the wood waste fuel), General Electric (contributing the gas engine), Professor John Grace in our faculty of Applied Science researching the project, Nexterra demonstrating its gasification technology and every single person on campus who depends on heat and light when they’re there. Jon? [Jon Rhone speaks to the benefit of the demonstration project to  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 14 of 20  Nexterra’s prospects, what others might expect working with UBC, particularly adaptability and responsiveness. John identifies the unique benefits that UBC provided to this project that, perhaps, he wouldn’t have been able to find elsewhere.] Thank you, Jon. You may have heard me or others speak of the University as a Living Laboratory. This is a “living” example of that concept. UBC invested $5.5 million dollars to get this project going. We mean it when we say we have skin in the game. I believe that UBC is out in front of most research intensive universities in this way: enabling companies like Nexterra, perhaps companies like your company, to do research, development and demonstration of breakthrough ideas. Sometimes you can’t find that needed partner in the private sector, but it’s increasingly possible that you could find it at UBC. Conspire with us. It’s awfully difficult to select just three examples to share with you. I thought of Janet because the purpose of our work together is social transformation. It involves the university’s core missions of education and community engagement. And it’s close to home. Working  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 15 of 20  together with Jon, Nexterra and our other team members in the Bioenergy project has as its purpose economic and technological transformation that involves our research mission. And it’s a great example of our University responding to ideas and initiatives that come to us, from people like you. That is something, frankly, that I hope to see happen more often. The third story that I want to share with you is a global one. And it’s also one of our newest. You may recall that at last year’s lunch I devoted my remarks to how you could use UBC to enter, or improve your position, on the world stage. For those of us on the Pacific Rim, that often translates to emerging markets such as China and India. These are very important, and UBC has a large number of initiatives—in place and in process—in places like these. But global means the whole globe. And if there’s a continent that has been thinking and working globally the longest, it is Europe. Among the many institutions that UBC has strong working agreements with is the University of Copenhagen. We’ve been collaborating in various ways for quite some time. There is a good fit here. Our values are closely aligned and our cultures are compatible.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 16 of 20  They, like we, have strong commitments to sustainability. They admire our focus on entrepreneurship, and we admire their strengths in business design thinking. One area in particular where we both saw great opportunities for working together is in healthcare. We have had a relationship with Copenhagen University since 1994. It is something that has been cultivated by Life Science Ambassador Søren Harbel, and this spring it blossomed into something much stronger and more extensive. In June I was privileged to go to Copenhagen along with several of my colleagues and there two important conspiracies were formalized. One is a very close strategic relationship between our Faculties of Pharmaceutical Science. This will enable some very exciting collaborative research and the opportunity to participate in Europe’s Innovative Medicines Initiative, which is a public-private initiative kick-started with a four billion Euro initial investment. Its purpose is to fund collaborative research and build networks of private industry and academic experts to boost pharmaceutical innovation and accelerate the discovery and development of better medicines. Our respective faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 17 of 20  work on both campuses and share research. We’ve already held a symposium in Denmark, and another will take place here later this year. Just recently an executive MBA team from Vancouver spent a few weeks in Denmark, studying, visiting healthcare facilities and examining the best practices of public-private health care delivery in that country. This was the first part of another strategic affiliation, between our Sauder School of Business and the Copenhagen Business School whose purpose is to provide practical, real-world global experience, and global exposure, for our students, our faculty, and theirs as well. Last week the Acting President & Dean of Research of the Copenhagen Business School, Alan Irwin and the Dean of Education, Jan Molin, paid a reciprocal visit to our campus. While they were here I invited them to say a few words to you. They are back in Denmark now and rather than impose the nine-hour time difference and the vagaries of the Internet on the task, we thought it better to ask them to record their remarks. They kindly took a moment out of their schedule and left this behind for you.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 18 of 20  [Screen shows video clip of Alan Irwin, who speaks to the necessity and practical benefit of global collaboration in business in general and business education in particular.] In 1624 the poet John Donne wrote “No man is an island entire of itself.” One way to rephrase that idea for business in the 21st Century is, “No one does everything in house anymore.” That’s a more prosaic expression, perhaps, but the point is similar. If you have a purpose, it’s wise to communicate it, because in doing so—in making it public—you will both find and attract others who share your purpose and who, potentially, have complementary capabilities to help you fulfill it. UBC is, realistically, a vast resource of capability, right in your neighborhood, and we are eager to work with you. No matter what you might wish to accomplish, in almost any area, the chances are that we share your goals and can conspire with you to reach them. Conspire. Com - spirare "to breathe together." I like this image. A team  of different people, gathered together in a huddle, breathing together as they formulate a plan.  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 19 of 20  Breathing together… There are two additional senses of this image that I’d like to suggest to you as I conclude. The first is that we can no longer ignore the fact that we all breathe the same air. This is literally true of our environment but only recently have we come to truly feel it. It is our shared resource and our shared responsibility. This is the essence and the urgency of sustainability as it relates to our world, our economy and our society. It is also metaphorically true that we breathe the same air in enterprise. As businesses and institutions operating in an increasingly interdependent global environment, we are conspiring whether we realize it or not. And the more aware and mindful we are of our connections, the better for us all. And second, the image of breathing together conjures an orchestra of musicians with their wind instruments and brass. French horns, oboes, saxophones, piccolos, trumpets…We may each try to blow our own horns, but think of how much more powerfully we can play if we sound them in concert. Teamwork, joint venture, collaboration, strategic alliance, community  Vancouver Board of Trade 14 September 2011 Page 20 of 20  organizing, cooperation, association, coalition, tribe, partnership. There are many ways we speak of it. The important thing is to do it. For that we need one another. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, conspirators, let us join forces so that we may achieve real things that transform our world for the better. Thank you.  
1.0107501~Symposium : APRU responses to Asia-Pacific issues~Toope, Stephen J.~ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC RIM UNIVERSITIES (APRU) Theme: Global Challenges – Pacific Perspectives Symposium: APRU Responses to Asia-Pacific Issues Stephen J. Toope, UBC – Thursday, July 1, 2010  ASK FOR THE MOON Universities’ Responsibility for Sustainability  My thanks to our hosts here at the University of Auckland and to the APRU Secretariat, and my greetings to you all from Canada and from The University of British Columbia. It‟s a pleasure to be with you again.  On April 20th, I received an invitation from Stuart [McCutcheon, ViceChancellor of the University of Auckland] to speak at this symposium on the topic of UBC‟s sustainability initiative. On that same day, an oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. And although the two events would seem not to be connected, I have been unable to think about one without considering the other ever since.  I have watched and listened to as much coverage of the oil spill as my heart can take, and after a few weeks my ears became attuned to the  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 2 of 14  sound of a very strange refrain: it was the voices of newscasters explaining to viewers who do not live on the Gulf Coast of America why they should care.  It astounds me that, a full generation into this Internet-driven era of global awareness, there are still people who do not understand that we are all connected.  Robert Bringhurst, a Canadian poet who has also translated works from many languages including aboriginal ones, says the lands are the universities, are the libraries. In an essay called “Poetry and Thinking” in his book The Tree of Meaning, he says, “Sun, moon, mountains and rivers are the writing of being, that literature of what-is. Long before our species was born, the books had been written. The Library was here before we were. We live in it. We can add to it, or we can try; we can also subtract from it. We can chop it down, incinerate it… bury it under our trash. But we didn‟t create it, and if we destroy it, we cannot replace it ….”  The oil spill that began April 20 [and that gushes on still, 72 days later] is rightly being called the worst environmental disaster in human history. And yet … American environmentalist Bill McKibben points out  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 3 of 14  that “bad as this is, it‟s only a small and visible symbol of the greater damage we do each day simply by burning coal and gas and oil. If that [oil] now washing up [on shore] had ended up safely in the gas tanks of our cars, it would nonetheless have done great damage. It‟s all dirty.”  And yet … an announcement last month from the United Nations‟ Food and Agriculture Organization reminds us that the environmental degradation due to global livestock production – from deforestation to water pollution to biodiversity loss to climate change – is on par with that of the transport sector and, based on growing demand from developing countries, due to double by the year 2050.  The world‟s senior environmentalists are calling climate change the worst problem humanity has ever faced. There is no question in my mind that at this moment in time, the habitability of the planet and our survival as a species are truly at risk. In the face of these extreme, and extremely frightening, statements, what is the responsibility of the people in this room? What I‟m asking is, what is the role of the university? These are complex global challenges, yes, but to what extent are they also “Asia-Pacific issues?” Most importantly, what  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 4 of 14  solutions might we, the universities in this network, be able to discover by working together?  I believe that the Asia-Pacific region can and must be the global epicenter for the sustainability agenda for the 21st century. A significant component of the fate of the planet and its peoples will be decided by what happens here in the coming decades. With the wide range of cultures and societies we represent at varying levels of social and economic development, this region will be a test-bed for social and cultural sustainability: our ability to live in harmony not only with the planet but with each other. We are dealing intensively with issues of social justice, equity, sustainable livelihoods, and corporate social responsibility.1 But I have come to believe that all sustainability issues are social sustainability issues. Whether we are developing clean, renewable energies, growing green businesses, or relearning to grow our food ourselves, we are searching for ways to meet our needs without compromising those of future generations. We are looking to sustain human society, and I believe many of the answers lie here, with us.  1  This paragraph from John Robinson’s response to my request for feedback.  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 5 of 14  I last spoke to this group about UBC‟s sustainability initiative in 2008, and I will speak today about the progress we have made since then as well as about my changing sense of the place sustainability must hold in a university‟s academic and operating models. My message today differs from that of two years ago in terms of the level of urgency that exists now, and in the degree of responsibility I believe universities bear for sustainability at the global level. My message today is an invitation: I, and the faculty, staff, and students at UBC, want to work with you. I want us all to work more closely together. We share a sense of place characterized by our proximity to, and dependence upon, one another and the ocean that connects us. We have a long history of close relations and we enjoy many strong connections. But if those connections are to bear up under the kinds of challenges I‟m speaking of, then we must renew our commitment to strengthening our ties, finding our commonalities, respecting our differences, and pursuing solutions across disciplines, across institutions, across an ocean, together.  I believe that a university‟s responsibility to the global sustainability agenda is threefold: 1. First, a university must use its voice. It must make a clear and very public commitment to sustainability at every level, from  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 6 of 14  academics to operations, and it must educate and inform all communities in which it enjoys an influence. 2. Second, a university must be a model. It must become what UBC calls a „living laboratory,‟ undertaking to make its own environmental, economic, and social ecology sustainable, as well as working with communities, businesses, institutions, and governments to demonstrate the power and possibilities of working in partnership. Universities cannot demand that governments and corporations do better unless they can demonstrate what they mean. 3. And third, a university must provide the means for change. In other words, through research, development, and commercialization, it is up to universities to help provide the technologies, processes and systems to support systemic change, and to share them as broadly as possible wherever they are needed.  I ask a lot of a university, I know. Many might accuse me of asking too much. We have a saying in North America when someone seems to be asking for too much; we say, You might as well ask for the moon! But you see, I was a small boy when an American president asked for the moon and got it. He said, “We choose to go to the moon … not  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 7 of 14  because [it is] easy, but because [it is] hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.”2 So I believe in aiming high, and I am willing to accept the challenge, and unwilling to postpone it.  Let me tell you what UBC is doing in terms of raising its voice, modeling sustainability, and providing the means for change.  First, voice. Since the start of this year, UBC has been operating under a renewed strategic plan, called Place and Promise. It is comprised of nine commitments – not aspirations but promises – one of which is to explore and exemplify all aspects of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. We have reconfigured our budgeting system to align funding for both academic and operational initiatives with the deliverables of our strategic plan. Operationally, every element of the University‟s operations has been costed out over a 25-year time horizon. Academically, a team headed by Dr. John Robinson, Executive Director of Sustainability for UBC, has developed the Sustainability Academic Strategy, which responds to the burgeoning demand for sustainability education. The strategy provides 2  Idea borrowed from an article by Bill McKibben (June 15) in the Huffington Post (online) asking President Obama to take a stand on climate change and lead.  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 8 of 14  opportunities for students in any faculty to incorporate elements of sustainability learning into their course of study. In addition to making UBC a more attractive place to learn and work, the strategy takes advantage of the fact that the best way to raise our voice is to raise 70,000 voices; that‟s the number of students, staff, and faculty at UBC who can take sustainability messages, models, and methods into their home communities.  Modeling. We call UBC a „living laboratory.‟ That means two things: one, that we‟re using the physical entity of the University to test sustainable technologies and systems; and two, that we‟re demonstrating the power and possibilities of partnerships with other institutions, with business, government, and even our own alumni. With respect to the first, we‟ve retrofitted nearly 300 academic buildings on our Vancouver campus, reducing greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions by 8,000 tonnes a year and energy costs by $2.6 million. The savings will pay for the retrofit before 2020. Our public transit program has increased student and staff transit ridership by 185 percent, cutting GHG output a further 16,000 tonnes per year. Our garbage composter diverts 300 tonnes of waste food per year, and since 2006 increased recycling has diverted a further 46 percent of solid waste from landfills. Our Okanagan campus is undertaking a geo-  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 9 of 14  thermal project with the goal of making it the first carbon-neutral campus in Canada and perhaps the world. And our Vancouver campus is part of what is now called UTown@UBC, which includes increased student and staff housing, childcare, and amenities such as a full-size grocery store, reducing the need to travel to and from our campus, which is separated from downtown Vancouver by a large and beautiful public park. Early this year, we publicly committed to eliminating 33 percent of our GHG emissions beyond 2007 levels by 2015, and by 100 percent by 2050.  With respect to partnerships, we are working to build strong connections at local, regional, national, and international levels, in the hope of increasing our collective effectiveness against sustainability challenges, and to show that concerted effort is both possible and necessary. Global efforts such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Conference of the Parties may not have achieved their aims, but that doesn‟t mean that the intentions behind them were wrong. What it may mean, for now at least, is that we build strength and effectiveness at local and regional levels and grow from here. I‟m energized by the strong relations we share with so many of your institutions, and I‟m excited by expanding partnerships in Asia, and China in particular.  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 10 of 14  The sustainability challenges presented by the two sectors I mentioned earlier – the environmental and economic costs of non-renewable resource extraction, and the environmental degradation caused by livestock production – are set to grow exponentially because of the economic rise of China and India, two highly populous countries. The prevailing concept of economic growth is intrinsically linked to resource extraction and access to animal protein. Fast cars and fast food for everybody. It is tempting for sustainability leaders in the west to counsel against both now, to preach, Do as we say, and not as we have done ourselves for decades. But it is up to us, I think, to sidestep the preaching and help find real solutions together for people on both sides of the Pacific. A first step will be finding a new paradigm that can shift our thinking about growth.  Business partnerships. The UBC Sauder School of Business offers an MBA in sustainability and business. Dr. James Tansey‟s Centre for Sustainability and Social Enterprise works with the business community to refine and enhance business practices in such areas as carbon markets, sustainable transportation, food security, and aquaculture. Notably, the Centre was engaged by the Vancouver Olympic Committee to assess the impact of the 2010 Winter Olympic  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 11 of 14  Games and to determine ways of making future Games more sustainable.  In May of this year, UBC formalized an agreement with the City of Vancouver in an example of partnership with government. The two parties created the Greenest City Action Team Scholars, whereby UBC graduate students work on issues of green economy and jobs, greener communities, and human health to help advance the City‟s long-term sustainability goals.  Alumni partnerships. Within the next year, UBC is set to launch the most significant alumni engagement and development campaign in Canadian history. We intend to bring the learning curve full circle by engaging an unprecedented number of alumni in mentoring students, volunteering on campus, returning to UBC to continue their learning, and helping commercialize important new innovations through their businesses.  Lastly, the University is providing the means for change. The UBC School of Community and Regional Planning, the first of its kind in Canada, has been instrumental in making Vancouver a model for dense, highly livable urban design. The UBC Clean Energy Research  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 12 of 14  Centre is Canada‟s only interdisciplinary facility dedicated to improving existing energy technologies and developing new sustainable energy sources. Researchers are working on everything from renewable energies to clean-burning engines, fuel cell systems, and advanced hydrogen production methods. UBC‟s Faculty of Land and Food Systems researchers are exploring sustainable protein sources for developing regions as well as bio-fuel development. This year, UBC will open the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability. The new centre is designed to accelerate the adoption of sustainable building technologies and urban development practices in society. It will also be the greenest institutional building in North America.  UBC is proud of the leadership role it plays in sustainability modeling and innovation. We‟re doing so much, but the scope and scale of the problems are such that we cannot solve them alone. So let me extend my invitation again: let us work together. Contact UBC‟s international office, or get in touch with our researchers directly. More than anything, I would like to return to this group in a year and talk not about UBC‟s sustainability initiative but APRU‟s.  I mentioned the Olympics earlier. If you had the chance to see the Opening Ceremonies that took place in Vancouver this past February,  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 13 of 14  either live or on television, you may remember that one of the performers was a poet named Shane Koyczan. He delivered part of a poem entitled “We Are More” and he was speaking about Canada, but he could have been speaking about our young group and about the connections we‟re building through APRU. I‟d like to leave you with a few lines from that spoken poem: we are an idea in the process of being realized we are young we are cultures strung together then woven into a tapestry and the design is what makes us more than the sum total of our history  … we believe in generations beyond our own knowing now that so many of us have grown past what used to be we can stand here today filled with all the hope people have when they say things like “someday”  …  Professor Stephen Toope The University of British Columbia Page 14 of 14  and all of our aspirations will pave the way for those who on that day look towards tomorrow and still they say someday  If those who come after us are to have a „someday‟ they can look forward to, then our someday must be today. We can‟t wait for someone else‟s plan; we need to lay our own. We need to raise our voices as one voice. We need to model what we mean by sustainability by effective coordinated action. And we need to provide the technological, process and systematic means for others to follow our lead. I know … I may as well ask for the moon. But in fact it‟s not the moon I want at all but something much closer to home. I‟m only asking for this place. This planet. This Earth. Let‟s work together.  -30-  
1.0107495~Federation of Indian chambers of commerce and industry higher education summit~Toope, Stephen J.~Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Higher Education Summit November 11, 2010 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  Honourable Ministers; Excellencies; Distinguished delegates.  It is an honour to be here today, to celebrate India’s National Education Day, to mark the birthday of Maulana Abdul Kalaam Azad, and to begin this sixth annual Higher Education Summit of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.  We are here on an auspicious day. November 11th is celebrated in many Commonwealth countries as Remembrance Day, an occasion on which to look back with thanks on the sacrifices that others have made during wartime so that we can live today in free and prosperous societies.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 2 of 15  If today is a day to look back with thanks, it is also a day to look to the future with hope. I believe that India’s choice to name November 11th as National Education Day is wise indeed. As India’s first Education Minister, Maulana Azad, laid an admirable foundation for this country’s future, establishing free education at the primary level and laying the cornerstones of intellectual and economic success by helping to found the Indian Institutes of Technology.  Maulana Azad made personal sacrifices in support of his fervent belief that people of different cultures and different religions could live and work together for mutual benefit. That, clearly, is a lesson that we can and must learn many times over and I will argue today that the people who learn it best will enjoy the greatest success.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 3 of 15  I have three goals in speaking to you today. First, I would like to bring greetings from Canada, and especially from our Canadian institutions of higher education.  Second, I want to propose to you what I believe is the very high value proposition of partnering with Canadian universities.  Third, I must commend the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, as well as the governments of India and Canada, for their support of higher education.  I am proud to say that I have come from Canada as part of the largest delegation of Canadian university presidents ever to go abroad together. It was a nightmare coordinating our schedules!  I hope you will recognize this venture as evidence of our commitment to building and enriching our relationship with India.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 4 of 15  I would not presume to tell you what a magnificent future stretches out before India today. All of you are much more directly involved than am I in the flourishing successes in India’s economy and society.  But I think it is important to say, in the clearest and most enthusiastic terms, that we in Canada have noticed what is happening here. We are engaged. We are excited. We want to be part of your success and we believe that we have the resources – intellectual as well as material – to join with you endeavours.  Our trip to India has been the catalyst for extraordinary collaboration among Canadian universities. Fifteen university presidents have come to Delhi. Together, we are working to provide opportunities for undergraduate students, and to build research and teaching links with our Indian counterparts. Members of the Canadian delegation have today already  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 5 of 15  announced new financial commitments, and have set in motion many activities that will bring Canadian universities closer to Indian students and institutions. At home in Canada, other universities have joined us to create the joint funding of 50 full fellowships for Indian graduate students to complete their Masters or Doctoral degrees in Canada.  This Fellowship program is an interesting investment for three reasons: First, it acknowledges the high value that we put on talented and hard-working Indian students. The great universities of the world are always competing for talent and it is increasingly clear that some of the very best talent available today is coming out of India’s educational system.  Second, this investment demonstrates that when it comes to attracting India’s great students, Canadian institutions have chosen to compete as a group, rather than to battle among  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 6 of 15  ourselves. The particular program I mentioned involves 8 Canadian universities that have decided to work together to attract and provide opportunities for stellar Indian graduate students. That leads to the third thing that makes this an interesting investment for us: in a world where innovation is increasingly the most valuable of all resources, our Canadian institutions want to do whatever we can to help India innovate – to help you build your own intellectual and research capacity – and we want to stay closely connected so that we may also learn from you.  Lest you think that we are here simply to tempt away your best students, let me stress that it is in our interest to ensure that this is a mutually beneficial relationship. We know that the connections made by students turn into academic and business contacts in the future. Of course Canada wants to attract talent. But we are also committed to seeing many Canadian-educated  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 7 of 15  students return to their home countries, helping to build bridges that will ensure future social and cultural exchange as well as business opportunities.  The University of British Columbia has considerable experience in building these bridges. We already have formal agreements in place with Indian institutions including the University of Delhi and various Indian Institutes of Technology. We have regularly received and sent out talented students through an active student mobility agreement with IIT Delhi that has been in place for more than a decade. We also have other exchange agreements linking us to institutions across the country in a variety of disciplines. And, I can tell you, each such agreement creates not just a lasting connection, but an appetite for more extensive collaboration.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 8 of 15  Now, permit me to say a little about what Canada has to offer to prospective Indian students – what is that “value proposition” that I noted earlier?  I should perhaps first say that none of my comments should be taken as criticism of the offerings from other jurisdictions. My colleague and the next speaker, Georgetown University President Dr. John DeGioia could, I am sure, make a compelling argument for the value that American universities provide.  That said, 225,000 Indian students choose to study abroad each year and a further three million Indians between the ages of 18 and 24 are currently struggling to find available or affordable options for higher education.  There are obviously many great students who are looking for options inside and outside India. I want to ensure that when those  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 9 of 15  students are contemplating their choices for gaining a high quality education, Canada is among the destinations they consider.  A distinguishing characteristic of the Canadian system is that it is overwhelmingly public and relatively affordable. And the best of our institutions are consistently rated among the very top research intensive universities in the world. In Canada, outstanding quality and accessibility go hand in hand.  Indian students who choose to study in Canada arrive to discover a safe, open-minded, democratic and highly multicultural society that welcomes, indeed embraces, diversity. Alongside the several hundred Indians studying at the University of British Columbia as International Students, more than five per cent of our “domestic” students are of South Asian ancestry. Almost half of our student body boasts origins in Asian countries.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 10 of 15  We take intercultural understanding very seriously. As I implied earlier, societies that have promoted cultural understanding and cooperation (India prominent among them) have proved in the past to be the most resilient, the most innovative and the most creative.  People who live in an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding are more comfortable to do their best work. At UBC, we have found that cultural diversity creates an intellectual and social vitality that is itself so valuable that we – as with many other Canadian institutions – now actively work to further diversify our student body, and our faculty.  Indian students who have already studied in Canada have also reported finding a concentration on critical thinking and problem solving rather than rote learning. We work hard to ensure that  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 11 of 15  our students understand how to think, rather than trying to convince them of what to think.  Our universities are widely varying in size. But many provide students with access to research. Our students find that they can enjoy a hands-on research opportunity even at the undergraduate level. And they are highly likely to wind up working in teams in which undergrads, graduate students and faculty members work together in a relationship that is collaborative rather than hierarchical.  Those were attributes that were reported by some of the 105 Indian students who participated in the Global Link program this summer. In the Global Link program, we have launched a series of summer internships in which international undergraduate students get to work alongside top-flight Canadian researchers. It is all organized through something called MITACS, a Canadian  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 12 of 15  research network that connects university-based researchers with industry, government and the not-for-profit sector to develop the tools and technologies that help support and expand Canada’s knowledge-based economy.  The industry connection is immediate. Global Link students are usually working on applied research. They are searching directly for answers to challenges that Canadian and international industries and NGOs are facing in the highly competitive world.  The Indian students who have participated in the MITACS Global Link program are superlative.  Here in India, MITACS works with leading educational institutions, including IITS that are recognized as among the best in the world. As you know, to be admitted to an IIT, students have to achieve the top 2 % in the IIT Junior Entrance Examinations. From this  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 13 of 15  impressive starting point, the Global Link students go on to achieve a CGPA average of 9.06. That’s out of a total of ten.  In fact, one Global Link student came to UBC from BITS Pilani with a perfect score of ten. He is absolutely amazing – not only an outstanding scholar, but also a black-belt in Karate and a volunteer in the National Service Scheme. He is a shining example of the kind of person growing up in India today – someone with so much to contribute. He deserves every opportunity to thrive.  Ladies and gentlemen, we all must live – and I hope prosper – in the same, competitive world. And for that reason, I want to close by saying how impressed I am by the foresight that the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry shows in supporting a conference on higher education.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 14 of 15  It is clear from developments over the last 20 years that India has three enormous advantages when it comes to building one of the world’s great societies. The first I have already noted: India’s great diversity and its democracy. Second is an ambitious spirit that has long been evident, sometimes to an exhausting extent, in India! And the third is a burgeoning education system that, I would argue, has empowered India’s business leaders to be among the most creative and driven in the world.  What good fortune for Indian industry. You energize the domestic economy to such an extent that I understand the Indian growth rate is predicted to be at least 8.5% this year – a year in which many of the world’s largest economies are still struggling at the edge of recession.  What a tribute to the Indian government’s support of education – at every level. Maulana Azad’s legacy is everywhere apparent.  FICCI Higher Education Summit – November 11, 2010 Page 15 of 15  I am equally grateful for the support that governments – and industry – show for education in my own country. At the provincial and national levels, Canadian governments recognize the value and underwrite the success of institutions engaged in everything from basic education at the primary level to university based research that often leads the world.  I am delighted to note that next year has been designated as “the Year of India in Canada.” I hope that this designation will last for many years to come. I also hope that we will be able to share more of what is best about Canada with you as you share your best with us. On behalf of all my colleagues, fifteen Canadian university presidents, let me thank you for your warm welcome. And let me conclude with the hope that you will look to us as eager partners in the further development of Indian society.  
1.0102601~AAAS 2012 Annual Meeting : opening ceremony~Toope, Stephen J.~AAAS 2012 Annual Meeting—Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair 16 February 2012 The Right Honourable David Johnston, Dr. Fedoroff, my esteemed colleagues, members of government and the international media, friends:  I am honoured to share the chairmanship of such a critical event in international science and policy, and to do so with two associates whom I hold in such high regard. And I am privileged that in this capacity, I represent not only The University of British Columbia but also the province we call home and the country we serve. Like Dr. Huang, I wish to acknowledge the magnitude of planning required to bring all of us together today, and the effort that was made across the whole of Canada to execute a successful event in Vancouver. The Government of Canada and specifically Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada; the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; the Social  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 2 of 8  Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for Innovation—all were instrumental in the national effort that led to this moment. Just three institutions are represented on stage tonight, but in fact individuals from sister universities in every province and territory worked to ensure that we could stand before you now. To all of you, my thanks.  In the early years of this new millennium, American journalist Thomas Friedman was in India conducting research for a book on globalization. In the middle of a conversation with Nandan Nilekani, then-CEO of InfoSys Technologies Ltd., he heard him say, “The playing field is being leveled.” Friedman says he understood in that instant that “technological and political forces [had] converged [to produce] a global, Web-enabled playing field that allows for multiple forms of collaboration without regard to  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 3 of 8  geography or distance or … even language.” What resulted from that realization was his now-famous bestseller, The World Is Flat.  Praise for the book was not universal. Matt Taibbi, a journalist with the New York Press, for example, wrote a scathing review that included this comment: “The significance of Columbus’s discovery was that on a round earth, humanity is more interconnected than on a flat one. On a round earth, the two most distant points are closer than they are on a flat earth.”  The theme of this year’s conference is “Flattening the World: Building A Global Knowledge Society.” The question I raise is, should we be trying to flatten it? To level the scientific playing field so that all people everywhere have the same access to learning, research, and new knowledge? Or should we be taking advantage of our round earth? Using technology to shorten the  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 4 of 8  distance between science and policy, and between scientists and the general population?  The answer, of course, is that we must strive to do both, and I think we have to do both simultaneously. In order to bridge the gap that remains between scientific discovery and public policy, we—all of us in attendance at this conference—are going to need a public, a global community of citizens who understand enough about what’s going on in here to get engaged out there. To comprehend, and then to think and reason and grapple with the issues. To vote in and support the government representatives who will do what needs to be done. Comprehension, politicization, interconnection … and action.  There are nearly 8,000 of us here—researchers, academics, policy makers, and members of the media. To achieve our stated goal of  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 5 of 8  building a global knowledge society, we are going to have to acknowledge our own interconnectedness, and our interdependence. The most brilliant discovery cannot be fully exploited unless its significance can be grasped by decision makers and put into practice by and for the general populace.  So let’s flatten the world. Let’s share our stories with one another, and then let’s broadcast those stories, and the new ideas they engender, as widely as possible. It should be our aim that by the end of these four days, everyone with access to a computer, wireless handheld, television, radio, or good old-fashioned newspaper should know what we have learned.  I, for one, want the world to know that Canada is leading the way in making critical contributions to the way all of us understand our oceans, the changes in our climate, the sustainability of the  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 6 of 8  planet. I want the world to hear of Dr. Karen Bakker’s interdisciplinary research on water governance issues such as privatization and water access in developing nations. To know the work of Dr. Julio Montaner in treating and preventing HIV/AIDS. To learn of Dr. Michael Hayden’s predictive genetic test for Huntington’s disease, now the standard of care worldwide. And to understand how Dr. Carl Weiman, now with the Executive Office of the U.S. President, is revolutionizing the way science is taught. All of them are with The University of British Columbia, and all of them are changing paradigms in their respective fields.  Most exciting of all: Theirs are just four of nearly 170 different symposia, lectures, seminars, and workshops by delegates from over 50 countries. So researchers, tell your stories, to as many people as will listen. Delegates, take in as many sessions as you  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 7 of 8  can, and begin to build connections—between ideas and among one another.  And then: Let’s take that flat world, that level playing field, and form the links and networks and connections that will bring it back around full circle. Members of the media, you have an extraordinary responsibility here. I want to take this opportunity to thank you in advance for the role you will play in ensuring that the ideas and intelligence and insights brought forth over the next four days are translated in such a way as to inspire understanding and action on the part of audiences around the world. Through modern technology, ideas presented at a seminar here can appear on newsfeeds thousands of miles away even before that seminar ends. And as will become apparent during presentations on food production and safety, global health, energy, and climate change, that urgency is critical. I don’t envy you the task, but I  AAAS 2012 Opening Ceremony Professor Stephen J. Toope, Co-Chair Page 8 of 8  speak for all of us when I say we are grateful to you for taking it on.  After 177 gatherings, the AAAS conference is truly an international and interdisciplinary event. With this, the 178th meeting, we must acknowledge our interdependence, and ensure that our interconnectedness extends beyond the duration of this conference. The importance of the discoveries being shared here is matched by the imperative that they be translated into policy, and put into practice. Our world—flat and round—depends on it.  Thank you.  
1.0107507~Diversity improves our university and our country~Toope, Stephen J.~Diversity improves our university and our country Originally published in The Vancouver Sun on October 16, 2010 By Stephen Toope  This fall has seen the annual news stories about university enrolments. A seasonal theme: with strong demand pushing university entrance averages, how on earth can UBC be deliberately increasing the numbers of out-of-province and international students? After all, isn't it called the University of British Columbia? Indeed it is, and I want to make the case for why our enrolment goals support British Columbia and enhance its place in Canada and the world. Nationally, we are targeting a slightly larger percentage of our students to come from out of province. Most people understand why students move across provincial boundaries: program choice, for example, or the chance for personal growth in an exciting new locale. As British Columbians we’d complain if any province were to limit education opportunities for our students. In fact, this national flow of university students is a major nation-building contribution, creating lifelong personal links in every sphere of Canadian life, in every corner of the country. Historically, B.C. has been a net exporter of university students to other regions of Canada. We have been losing talent; now we are attracting it, too. International student mobility is not always as well understood. The gains for British Columbia are extremely important, but first it helps to see the global view. The Economist reported in August that international students average 21 per cent of students at the 10 highest-ranked universities in the world. According to the article, Canada has about five per cent of the world market for international students. That’s not bad for a country of our size, but is it good enough? For a university such as UBC, where international students make up 11.5 per cent of undergraduates and 25 per cent of graduate students at the Vancouver campus, it is not -- and we are seeking to increase it. Why? Consider what these young men and women bring with them. Of course, they’re bright and full of ambition; that’s true of our students in general. But more than that, outof-country students bring perspectives to the classroom and to dorms that lend otherwise unattainable insights into the global community for our local students. International students bring not only their own human gifts but also a whole network of family, business, academic, cultural and social ties that Canada needs to succeed in the global community. The personal contacts that international students make during their  university years are often a precursor to a variety of new relationships, from business and diplomatic opportunities to laying the groundwork for travel-learning opportunities for Canadian students abroad. All these activities have tremendous benefits for the B.C. and Canadian economies. That, and tourism-related economic stimulus arising from their spending in the local economy, is some of what international students provide B.C. What do they take from B.C.? At UBC, international undergraduate students pay the total cost of their education, unlike Canadian students who receive government subsidies. So one thing they don’t take is the place of a single domestic student. This isn’t a zero-sum exercise; it’s a net-benefit one. Another way to see how this global ebb and flow benefits B.C. is to examine the international dimensions of research and how such students contribute to the global increase of knowledge. Globally oriented universities like UBC take advantage of strengths of partner institutions all over the world to leverage and accelerate discovery. But tending these networks takes considerable effort. A 2009 survey ranks UBC in the top 10 of the world’s universities for research collaboration with partner institutions. International students, graduate students in particular, bring with them the seeds of current and future research collaboration, tending links among their professors across the global research enterprise. Professors, in hot pursuit of their academic interests, go where ideas and like-minded colleagues concentrate, which is, in turn, a magnet for the keenest student minds. The product of all this research is not just the spinoff enterprises that create jobs in the local economy, but in the social policy, health care and cultural spinoffs we need to tackle the huge global challenges that are just too vast for any single institution to move. The children of British Columbians will continue to be the large majority of UBC’s students. This fall, they are welcoming their student colleagues from across Canada and around the world with not just the understanding, but the experience that this diversity is a key to their own future well-being.

1.0102597~More than a grade~Toope, Stephen J.~Originally appeared in The Vancouver Sun, 27 January 2012 By Professor Stephen Toope, President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  More than a grade Every year at this time, parents who have children graduating from high school get very focused on university applications. I talk to many of them, and their stress around this particular rite of passage can be summed up by one question: Are my child’s grades good enough? Strong academic performance and course grades are one of the best predictors of university success, and they will continue to be very important. But should they be the only qualifier? Should we not aspire to a more complete understanding of a person’s individual potential? At the University of British Columbia, the answer is a resounding yes. UBC students need more than test-taking skills to succeed. They are given enriched opportunities to learn, in many ways and many different settings. We have a better way to evaluate which students will do well, and indeed contribute their individual talents and passions to their learning and that of their classmates. This year, all students applying to direct-entry undergraduate programs at UBC’s Vancouver campus will complete a “Personal Profile.” This involves answering four to six questions about other kinds of learning, outside-the-class experiences, and personal goals. The questions allow each student to shine the light on the person they are – beyond scholastic achievement. Some will reflect on what they learned from volunteer experiences and hobbies. Others may discuss how they’ve grown as a result of home responsibilities or the jobs they’ve had. This more comprehensive approach is called broad-based admissions. A few of our faculties and programs have been using it for several years. But it is new and significant that we will require it for all undergraduate programs at our Vancouver campus this year. We are the largest university in Canada to embrace this approach. UBC programs that already use this approach see strong results. Armed with better information, they are admitting students who are more engaged with their studies and with the community, and who show strong initiative and leadership.  The questions we use are based on extensive research, and a small army of faculty and staff are professionally trained to review submissions. Two evaluators blind-score each application - they don’t know the applicant’s name, gender or other personal information. We also have ways to spot responses that aren’t authentic. Going beyond the grades means students can step forth as a whole person, and once they’re admitted, they’re more likely to thrive and succeed. And that’s something a parent can celebrate. Just remember, deadline for applications is January 31st. Good luck! Prof. Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor University of British Columbia  
1.0102634~Conferral of degrees to Japanese-Canadian students (Class of ‘41/42)~Toope, Stephen J.~Conferral of Degrees to Japanese-Canadian Students (Class of ‘41/42) Professor Stephen J. Toope, President and Vice-Chancellor 30 May 2012, 3:45-5:30 p.m.  On the truly momentous days of our lives, most of us experience a kaleidoscope of thoughts and emotions. This is one such day. As UBC formally welcomes the 76 Japanese Canadian students of 1942 into our alumni family, the emotions I feel most deeply are a profound gratitude to the students and their families, and joy over this homecoming. That joy is tinged with sadness, because many are no longer with us. Let me tell you about one such person. Kiichi George Noguchi, born in 1919, was part of a hardworking Vancouver family. From 1937 to 1942 he studied chemistry at UBC with a dream of becoming a doctor. Mr. Noguchi’s ability to attend his graduation, and pursue his dream, was shattered in 1942. Yet he pushed on. He was interned at Christina Lake and in the Slocan Valley. He married, worked hard, and eventually rose to the level of Vice President of Aerosol  Page 1 of 3  Conferral of Degrees – Japanese-Canadian Students, Class of ‘41/42 30 May 2012 Page 2 of 3  Packaging, and then President of his own company. Mr. Noguchi passed away just two months ago. I must add, we have learned that another student who was planning to attend, James Hajime Hasegawa, passed away just a few days ago on May 17. My heartfelt condolences go to these families. The story of Mr. Noguchi epitomizes the legacy of these students: human decency can triumph over ignorance. Today, I want to honour the memory of Mr. Noguchi and Mr. Hasegawa, and all of these students, by acknowledging UBC’s part in this dark episode. At the time, too few in our community stood up in your defense. And this is what makes those who did, stand out all the more. Henry Angus, and E.H. Morrow were among those who spoke up, and provided support to students. I am so pleased some of their family members are with us today.  Conferral of Degrees – Japanese-Canadian Students, Class of ‘41/42 30 May 2012 Page 3 of 3  Seventy years later, these Japanese Canadian students of 1942 gained a new advocate: Mary Kitigawa. Mary, we are indebted to you for your persistence. We hope the actions we are taking – to learn from our mistakes by preserving the historical record, and to develop educational initiatives for future students – provides an enduring, meaningful response. To each of you students and your representatives, by accepting these degrees, you offer us a true gift of grace. It is a gift that awakens the best of human nature in all of us. Thank you.  
1.0102605~2012 Spring Congregation and Convocation~Toope, Stephen J.~2012 Spring Congregation and Convocation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  23 May – 7 June 2012  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2012.  What is the point of a university education? No doubt a few of you are asking that question as you sit today, at graduation, poised on the cusp of a new life – a life full of promise, but also with the inevitable uncertainty that marks all transitions. Recently, I was privileged to hear an address by the great Mexican essayist and novelist, Carlos Fuentes. Sadly, he died only a few days after I heard him speak. He was reflecting upon the role of universities, and I think that he said something profound. He argued that the university is a place where “people learn to be freer.” i Some of that freedom is physical and emotional – in university most of us move quickly on that continuum of learning who we are. We may live on our own for the first time, away from our families. Even if we live at home, our sense of independence, of freedom, is likely to grow. We spend more time with friends and classmates than with our families. Our parents don’t have the day-to-day influence they had in our childhood. Before you parents get angry with me, let me tell you that I share your pain. My eldest daughter is studying in Europe. Her freedom is a constant challenge to my need to protect and connect! But of course, Fuentes was talking about something bigger than physical freedom, and something additional to emotional freedom. When he speaks of a university as a place where “people learn to be freer,” he means freer intellectually, even spiritually. I hope that your time at the University of 2  British Columbia has opened up new worlds of ideas to you. I hope that your teachers and classmates have challenged you so profoundly that some of your deepest assumptions have been rocked. I hope that you have been introduced to cultures and world views that have caused you to question your fixed ideas. In short, I hope that you are freer today than when you arrived here – freer of prejudice, freer of settled points of view that prevent you from seeing other ways of thinking, freer of assumptions that cloud analysis and block emotions. How does that happen? How does education help make you freer? Well, oddly, it is in large measure through intellectual discipline and the recognition of boundaries that freedom is built. In the last few months a rather interesting, if seemingly arcane, debate has opened up in the pages of some leading magazines and in the blogosphere over the utility of “brainstorming.” At first blush, “brainstorming” would seem to rely on the value of unfettered creativity, on unshaped thinking. Indeed, at its inception, in the 1940s, “brainstorming” was described by the person who coined the term, Alex Osborne, an advertising executive, as a creative process that requires the free flow of ideas in a group, without any criticism or negative feedback. Osborne suggested that “[c]reativity is so delicate a flower that praise tends to make it bloom while discouragement often nips it in the bud.”ii It turns out that pretty compelling research does not support Osborne’s view. Professor Keith Sawyer, a psychologist at the University of Washington, concludes that “[d]ecades of research [has] consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same 3  number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas.” iii Does that mean that all those group projects you did in high school and here at UBC were a waste of time? That we humans are intellectual isolates who don’t need to work together? Well, happily, it does not. In a recent article in The New Yorker, the young and very cool science writer, Jonah Lehrer, reviews fascinating research that shows convincingly that the very best way to produce ideas is not solitary confinement. But nor is it free association in a group. In the words of Professor Charlan Nemeth of Berkeley, “[o]ur findings show that debate and criticism do not inhibit ideas but, rather, stimulate them relative to every other condition.”iv An increasingly powerful body of research reveals that the notion of the creative superhero, the lonely artist, is a myth: creativity is rooted in social interaction. Philosopher August Comte opined that “[t]he most profound thinker will…never forget that all men must be regarded as coadjutors in discovering truth.”v We may or may not agree that “truth” is there to discover, but at the very least we are more likely to be able to approach truth in settings where our ideas are challenged, where our assumptions are tested, where open debate is encouraged. We are actually freer when our own thoughts are disciplined in discourse with our teachers and peers.  Life is full of  surprises; we will never have all the answers. You surely do not have all the answers today, just because you are graduates of a great university. As Fuentes reminds us: “Education contains the questions that are still to come.” That is the point of a university education. Good luck to you all!  4  i  Carlos Fuentes, Keynote Address, Conference of the Americas on International Education, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 26 April 2012. ii Quoted in Jonah Lehrer, “Groupthink: the brainstorming myth,” The New Yorker, 30 January 2012, 22, at 22. iii Quoted in ibid., at 23. iv Quoted in ibid., at 24. v Quoted in R.

1.0102614~Create UBC pep rally~Toope, Stephen J.~Page 1 of 6  Create UBC Pep Rally 4 September 2012 Professor Stephen Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  How many people would say that they are having a great first day at UBC?  How many think that they have chosen the best university in Canada?  How many think their faculty or program is better than any other?  Well I am glad you feel that way, and I think you are in for many wonderful experiences during your time here. But in order for that to occur, you?re going to have to put your creativity to work.  Create truly is a perfect theme for a day like this. I hope that the word itself is an inspiring call to action. The other reason I like Create as a theme is that its meaning in the context of this day is appropriately subject to interpretation.  The way I see it, to create?is to be original.  Create 4 September 2012 Page 2 of 6  With that interpretation as a premise, I want to share some simple ideas concerning the importance of originality, of becoming a skilled and independent free thinker, which many contend is the single most important objective of an undergraduate university experience.  Sounds simple enough, but finding originality and thinking for yourself is a process. It?s a process that begins with a willingness to be open-minded to varying points of view, followed by a careful analysis of the evidence offered in support of each one.  The final step in the process is to draw your own conclusions based on what you have determined to be the most compelling evidence to support your views. It?s the opposite of sub-consciously conforming to ?conventional wisdom? or popular opinion.  If at some point you study American literature, you may come across the writing of the 19th century transcendentalist philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Create 4 September 2012 Page 3 of 6  In a famous essay appropriately titled, On Self Reliance, Emerson implores the reader to resist conformity with the words: ?Insist on yourself; never imitate.?  But even if you don?t ever read Emerson, chances are a parent or a relative has already offered the same advice in similarly blunt terms.  ?Be a leader, not a sheep.?  ?You came into this world an original; don?t leave it a copy.?  Now I?ll admit that remaining an original can perhaps be challenging in an era in which pop culture is pervasive. Everywhere we go we are reminded of a world seemingly bent on conformity ? conformity to clothing styles, conformity to a narrow range of popular music, or to certain verbal expressions.  As an example, consider the drastic overuse ? and misuse ? of the word, ?awesome.? There was a time when it was a highly useful and expressive term, one selectively used only to describe things that elicited slack-jawed amazement. Sadly, its meaning has become Create 4 September 2012 Page 4 of 6  distorted. It?s fallen victim to sub-conscious conformity ? the antithesis of free-thinking originality.  So here?s an idea. Whenever you hear the word casually used to describe things that aren?t even vaguely ?awesome,? let that be a reminder to you about how one of your principle objectives during your time here is to strive for originality ? originality in your thoughts and in the manner in which you express them.  I have three recommendations for how you can refine these skills.  The first is to leave your comfort zone. Seek the discomfort of new experiences.  You?ll never have a better opportunity to try things you?ve never done before than here at UBC. Take a course in an unfamiliar subject; try a new sport; volunteer for a new cause; consider community or international service learning opportunities; sign up for co-op or mentorship programs; join a campus club, or explore the fine arts. The possibilities are infinite.  Create 4 September 2012 Page 5 of 6  The second recommendation is to interact with the widest possible range of people, and do it in a direct and respectful give-and-take manner. Facebook is a wonderful tool, but it can never be a substitute for face-to-face engagement. For that matter, consider more talking and less texting.  Become friends with somebody from a completely different country and culture than your own. Resist the natural urge to associate primarily with people from your home town, from your program or from your residence.  You may not know it, but in many cases the connections you make in the days ahead will become important lifelong relationships, so ensure that your network is large and diverse.  Third, and I cannot emphasize this enough; strive to become an effective communicator.  Remember that one of the essential aspects of being an original and skilled independent thinker is the ability to articulately express both your thoughts and the rationale that supports your views. Not only Create 4 September 2012 Page 6 of 6  that, but learning to communicate effectively in both written and verbal exchanges will be of paramount importance in every future endeavour you undertake ? personal and professional.  Finally, a solemn assurance: at UBC, undergraduate students matter.  Your success and fulfillment matters to me personally. It matters to your professors personally, and it matters personally to the staff members and student volunteers who have arranged this wonderful day called Create.  With that in mind, I sincerely hope that you take advantage of the many rich opportunities before you, and that you will consider these recommendations to seek new experiences, to open your minds to diverse perspectives, to hone your communication skills and?  To create?and to remain?an original.  Best wishes to you all, and welcome to UBC! It?s awesome! 
1.0102616~Improving Asia-Pacific science collaboration~Toope, Stephen J.~6 APRIL 2012    VOL 336    SCIENCE    www.sciencemag.org 38PolICyFORumAlthough there are important sci-entific contributions being made around the globe, the most dramatic new developments are taking place among nations in the Asia-Pacific. Of course, the United States and Japan have long been lead-ing Asia-Pacific innovator nations in science and technology, and Australia and Canada have been solid contributors to knowledge. But it is the relatively new entrants from the Asia-Pacific that are chang-ing the dynamic of science around the globe. Most extraordinary is the rise of China. According to a Royal Society report (1), the publications output of Chinese scien-tists is set to surpass that of U.S.-based scientists by 2013. Major invest-ments in discovery and innovation are build-ing capacity in Korea, Singapore, and Tai-wan. Enhanced collaboration between insti-tutions has the potential to lead to higher-impact research (2) and to tap the widening base of research expertise. Given the rapid rise in trade and economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific region, we propose that a concerted and immediate effort is required to enhance Asia-Pacific science collaboration.Promoting Researcher-to-Researcher LinkagesOver the last decade or so, great effort has been expended in trying to develop uni-versity-to-university linkages globally and around the Pacific. These forms of linkage include the Association of Pacific Rim Uni-versities (www.apru.org);Universitas 21 (www.universitas21.com); the International Alliance of Research Universities (www.iaruni.org); and the International Associa-tion of Universities (www.iau-aiu.net).Although these networks have helped cre-ate expanded opportunities in undergraduate student mobility and in the sharing of orga-nizational experience, none has had substan-tial impact in promoting enhanced research collaboration. Although seed-funding of small research initiatives and workshops has helped bring researchers together, this has not resulted in larger-scale collabora-tions because these efforts have been defined in a largely top-down manner, and there is a lack of adequate follow-on funding that could support collaborators across differ-ent countries. There are, however, ways of helping to encourage individual faculty and other researcher linkages through operational approaches that help identify needs, potential partners, and resources.For example, the Global Knowledge Ini-tiative (http://globalknowledgeinitiative.org/) has launched a series of programs that seek to connect resources and people around science, technology, and innovation chal-lenges of the developing world. The organi-zation is active globally, working with sci-entists to identify challenges, develop pur-pose?driven networks to tackle them, and build the skills required to innovate collab-oratively. Injecting rigor into the process of locating resources and partners (rather than the commonly observed, ad hoc approach) and making sense of the context in which collaborative innovation occurs, the organi-zation straddles the divide between national and regional development goals and individ-uals? capability and need to achieve them.Sharing CurriculaOne of the least efficient aspects of global university culture is the constant reinvention of curriculum at the department, and even individual faculty member, level. It is diffi-cult for professors at the best-resourced insti-tutions to keep up with all the developments in a teaching field that is usually wider than the professor?s specific research interests. For university teachers in the developing world, the effort is virtually impossible. If we want to create a more level playing field, use our professors? time more productively, and help to create the talent that will allow more effec-tive international collaboration to flourish, academic leaders must consider investing collectively in curricula that could be shared regionally.The Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology (MIT) open-curriculum platform is admirable in concept, but is not likely to Improving Asia-Pacific Science CollaborationScience in ASiARecommendations affecting researchers, curricula, institutions and tenure in the Asia-Pacific could increase innovation.Credit: AdApted from JiAn WAn/iStoCkphoto.Com*Author for correspondence.

We suggest that deans and curriculum develop-ment leaders from institutions in different countries could productively work together to develop curricula for specific courses that are at once up-to-date, transferable, and sensitive to resource constraints in different settings. In parallel, efforts could be made to engage with digital innovators to see how new tech-nologies might facilitate the wider sharing of the curricula developed.Although language barriers are real, they are not insurmountable. English is the lingua franca of science for the time being, and it would be possible to draw together teams to develop curricula in English, which could then be translated into a range of languages for students in various countries.Another great inefficiency in university curricula is the offering of advanced courses to small groups of students. In many fields, these courses are vital and must be taught every year, but only to the small numbers of students specializing in those areas. Simply forming consortia and teaching these courses collaboratively, perhaps using interactive dig-ital systems, would permit departments to cut their loads while allowing students and fac-ulty from different institutional settings and countries to learn from each other. An exam-ple is the National University of Singapore?University of Toronto joint minor in environ-mental science that leverages on complimen-tary academic strengths and avoids the need to develop ?duplicate? capabilities.Making International Collaboration Count in UniversitiesInternational collaboration is an effective and powerful way of bringing complemen-tary expertise together to pursue and achieve higher-impact science research (3). At the same time, international collaboration can also result in some cost and efficiency sav-ings by reducing the duplication of equip-ment and expertise in different localities. Yet, university faculty may choose not to pursue international collaboration opportunities for a variety of reasons, including, in particular, how collaborations are evaluated for tenure and promotion. Collaborative work, espe-cially interdisciplinary work, is often dis-couraged because of the view that young fac-ulty members must establish their individual reputations in their own disciplines.Tenure and promotion decisions are among the most important ways of influenc-ing the future direction of universities. The balance that has been struck in most globally influential universities is to focus tenure and promotion decisions equally on research and teaching, with less but some emphasis being given to ?service.? We think that universities and their faculty associations would benefit from explicitly taking productive interna-tional collaboration into account in the pro-motion and tenure process.We are not suggesting that every profes-sor must collaborate internationally. How-ever, international collaboration is appro-priate in many disciplines, and especially in fields that address global challenges. Finding concrete ways within university processes to recognize and create incentives for such col-laboration is important.Building Innovation EcosystemsFor decades now, social science researchers have identified the need to build ?clusters? for innovation to thrive and to be sustainable (4). Innovation ?hubs? have been identified in Silicon Valley (5), along route 128 outside Boston (6), in Cambridge in the UK (7), and in Tokyo (8), just to offer a few examples. It is clear that one of the key elements in the cre-ation of such clusters or hubs of innovation is the presence of at least one major research university. The most successful hubs have access to a collection of leading institutions of higher learning and research. But great universities alone are not enough.To create powerful centers of scientific and technological discovery and innovation, an entire ?innovation ecosystem? is required, (9) which encompasses a critical mass of diverse types of talent. These include high-quality researchers and graduate students and, in the case of biomedicine, clinician-scientists and clinical researchers linked to hospital sys-tems that are strongly supportive of transla-tional clinical investigation. Beyond these elements, the ecosystem needs experienced entrepreneurs who can incubate and grow promising start-up companies or can mentor others to do so. The presence of investors and venture capitalists willing to invest at various stages of development is crucial, particularly to provide early-stage funding and, in many cases, business expertise. Large technology or pharmaceutical companies, with their cor-porate laboratories, bring industry research and development (R&D) perspectives to the ecosystem, as well as expertise and opportu-nities for collaborative research, often with specific applications in mind.To work well, the ecosystem must foster an environment that promotes a free flow of people, ideas, and experiences across institu-tions and sectors. This sharing may be ham-pered by the traditional preoccupations with intellectual property protection, technology transfer, and commercialization at the level of individual institutions.We therefore encourage the convening of a group of relevant organizations to consider how stronger innovation ecosystems could be created in the Asia-Pacific and, in par-ticular, the role of enhanced transnational cooperation. The organizations should include agencies that promote science, sci-ence and technology research funders, uni-versities, and key business groups in the Asia-Pacific region.Further ImplicationsThe action steps that we detail here would, we believe, help to promote much stronger scientific collaboration in the Asia-Pacific. Other steps are implied in what we have sug-gested. These include greater talent mobil-ity among graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and established researchers, and the facilitation of mobility through more flex-ible visa arrangements, perhaps modeled on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) business travel card, which allows for pre-cleared multiple entry for frequent business travelers within the APEC region. Of course, there is still much to learn about the complex processes of scientific discov-ery, innovation, and the role of collabora-tion. These issues are of particular moment in the Asia-Pacific because of the fast emer-gence of new players with dramatically increased capacity for discovery. We encour-age further collective thought and suggest that research organizations, think tanks, and universities in the region would do well to elaborate shared programs to better under-stand the various existing mechanisms that promote scientific collaboration.References 1.

1.0102621~Technology will change universities as it changed the music industry~Toope, Stephen J.~Technology will change universities as it changed the music industry  By Stephen Toope, Special to The Globe and Mail April 25, 2013 The world?s media recently reported how a new approach to online learning ? called massive, open, online courses (MOOCs) ? allowed a 12-year-old girl from Pakistan to study subjects like astrobiology from the worlds? top universities. The story captured our attention, hinting at how education might open doors in ways unimaginable just a few years ago. While the potential for change is dramatic in developing countries, new learning technologies have the power to revolutionize life for Canadians, as well. A recent Statistics Canada survey suggests that as many as one third of Canadians have unmet learning needs. That is, because of family responsibilities, demands of work, or the challenges of location and time, many Canadians are unable to pursue the educational path they imagine for themselves. How many great teachers have we missed in our elementary schools, because life circumstances prevented them from earning credentials? What about the mother who might make a terrific psychologist, but must also care for a disabled child? Are there entrepreneurs among us who could transform their rural communities, if they could gain competitive business skills? And could your bus driver be the next great Canadian novelist, if only she could get a boost from inspiring creative writing coaches? MOOCs are certainly opening our eyes to the possibility of addressing these needs. They may also be the tail that wags the dog. The technology is evidence of dynamic forces at work to dramatically change higher learning. Four factors are rapidly taking us beyond the tipping point for major change in postsecondary education: advances in understanding how people learn; transformative technologies; a shift in demand for new learning options; and rising costs for the current bricks and mortar model. What is at play here is similar to the upheaval we?ve seen in the book, music and video industries. Technologies are driving dramatic new ways of enjoying these creative materials. The winners are almost everyone: There is massive access now to the very best works of art. But with the new forms of access come new forces of change, and pressure for the creators of these materials to rapidly adapt to new forms of content created in different ways and by almost anyone. The analogy is imperfect, however. Education is not a product to be passively consumed. Just as people still want to attend a concert, go to a high-quality bookstore, or prefer to see a hockey game in person rather than on TV, there will still be a place for physical classrooms and the exciting face-to-face experiences of learning. However, the factors mentioned above are pushing us to adopt more effective teaching methods like ?flipped? classrooms, where students review material online, and spend valuable class time in discussion and analysis. They are pushing us to make more use of blended learning, which involves a varied mix of technologies outside and inside class time. And they are pushing us to offer more high quality fully online programs. All together these represent an approach often called flexible learning. The challenge will be managing this profound change. Professors are not dispensers of information. They are guides through the growing vastness of information ? provokers of critical thought and analysis, facilitators and mentors who can effectively channel discussion so that the learning becomes a personal and a shared effort. For those who are passionate about education, the possibilities of change outweigh the anxieties. After leading UBC?s first MOOC on game theory, a course that attracted 130,000 learners, Prof. Kevin Leyton-Brown, an associate professor of computer science, enthused that he had four times as many Canadians in his course than he had taught in 10 years as professor. Seven years ago Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman chose UBC to host his initiative to enhance undergraduate science education by building on research in pedagogy and brain science. Over the past ten years, UBC has rebuilt its medical faculty to double the number of students through an innovative distributed education model, using technology to train doctors at sites across British Columbia. We don?t know yet what the future holds, but I invite universities across our country to join with us to embrace the challenge to develop innovative learning opportunities. Together we can open worlds to 12-year-old Pakistani girls and boys. But we can also unleash a new level of creativity and potential for Canadians. Stephen Toope is president and vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia.  
1.0107473~The University of British Columbia : here it is – it is yours~Toope, Stephen J.~The University of British Columbia: Here it is – It is yours  Installation Address of Professor Stephen J. Toope As Twelfth President and Vice-Chancellor Of the University of British Columbia  29 September 2006  Chief Campbell, Deputy Minister Quayle, Mayor Sullivan, Mr Chancellor, Chair of the Board of Governors, Governors, distinguished representatives of sister universities, Fellow Professors, Students, Staff Members, Alumni representatives, my Family and Friends:  Thank you all for joining me today in honouring the history and the promise of the University of British Columbia. The installation of a new president is a singular moment in the life of any university; a moment to reflect upon the past, to celebrate the present and to imagine an even more illustrious future. You have asked me to take on a mantle worn by such notable predecessors as Frank Wesbrook, Norman MacKenzie, David Strangway and Martha Piper. So my first words must be words of thanks to courageous and visionary forebears who in just under a century have built a university from extremely humble beginnings into a research and teaching powerhouse with global influence. But more than a proud 12th President, I am also an eager new student of UBC, and what I have discovered so far is fascinating, often inspiring, and always instructive. For example, it was the first President of UBC, Dr Frank Wesbrook, who coined the university motto: Tuum Est. I am happy to report that universities being what they are, privileged sites of debate and contention over ideas, there has long been disagreement over the proper translation into English of that motto. Although Wesbrook initially translated the phrase as "it is yours", he later wrote that he had come to prefer “it’s up to you” because it emphasized a student’s personal responsibility to learn and to achieve. With great respect, I beg to differ; I think that “it’s up to you” fits the predominant individualism of the early 20th century, but it underemphasizes the extent to which teaching, learning and research are collaborative ventures.  It is through social interaction that most great intellectual advances are made; even the archetypal lonely scholar of classics or philosophy sitting in her office and burning the midnight oil is interacting with earlier generations of scholars on  2  whose shoulders she stands to make her own contribution to knowledge. Scientists who work in labs know deeply that their discoveries are all collaborative. Nobel prizes are awarded to individuals, but I have always found that tradition a tad disingenuous; few scholars in any field work in isolation. Universities are not merely places where individuals pursue their individual endeavours, they are places where people work together to dream and to achieve common goals.  We need to find more ways to encourage collaboration, from building more physical spaces on the model of the Michael Smith Laboratories to seeding collaborative research that can attract support from outside the university. I am delighted to announce today the creation of the Martha Piper Research Fund, drawn from a five-year dedication of $5 million dollars from the Trek Endowment. As you may know, this endowment is produced from the proceeds of the University Town Development. Beginning to Honour the remarkable contributions of my predecessor, the Martha Piper Fund will be available for important new research projects, providing one-time seed funding of up to $25,000 for collaborative research projects, with a preference for interdisciplinary and international research teams.  What I like about "it is yours" is that the possessive pronoun “yours” in English can be singular or plural. And the attribution to the listener is not necessarily an attribution of ownership. No sensible construction of our UBC motto would suggest that each succeeding generation owns the University; merely that it is ours to cherish and to build together, as a trust for future generations.  So for today at least, let us accept this translation: Tuum Est – it is yours. But what is it that we have inherited in this great University, in all great universities? Let’s be bold and frankly acknowledge the treasure that is ours: nothing less than the panoply of life itself. Please listen to the challenging words of the brilliant poet-singer, Leonard Cohen who, like me, hails from Montreal:  3  Here it is Here is your crown And your seal and rings; And here is your love For all things. Here is your cart, And your cardboard and piss; And here is your love For all this. May everyone live, May everyone die. Hello my love, And my love Goodbye. Here it is…Here it is… So “here it is”, the triumphs and the tragedies of the human condition; all of life open to study, reflection and action based in the University.  Let’s start with the farthest, faintest stars in our known universe, discovered recently by a team of astronomers lead by UBC Prof. Harvey Richer. These stars died long ago, but as Professor Richer puts it: “pinning down their age narrows down the age range for the Universe.” Calculating the age of the universe; now there’s a big ambition!  From outer space, to inner space: Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli are everyday pathogens studied in the lab of UBC Prof. Brett Finlay. His team produces work leading to novel vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics that can be used to control and treat infections caused by a wide range of diseases that move across the globe and threaten our health.  “Here it is”:  4  Global environmental politics and corporate social responsibility are the objects of UBC Prof. Peter Dauvergne’s work. He analyzes the environmental initiatives of international leaders in corporate social responsibility, explains why these initiatives are being undertaken, and assesses their impact in terms of transparency, citizenship and environmental accountability.  Understanding the complex and often confusing representations of diverse minorities within the mass media is the focus of Prof. Stephen Foster’s work. He is coordinator of the CanWest Global Centre for Artists’ Video in the Faculty of Creative and Critical Studies at UBC Okanagan.  To return to the powerful image of Leonard Cohen’s song, “Here it is”: the acid smell of urine, this time in the worst back allies of the Downtown Eastside, where in 2000 UBC opened the Learning Exchange. The Learning Exchange brings volunteers from the UBC community—including students, staff, faculty, and alumni—to inner city schools and non-profit organizations that work in one of the poorest and most challenging urban sites in Canada. The volunteers contribute to community programs while learning about the issues that trouble our fellow citizens in the inner city. Despite its poverty, the Downtown East Side is not a defeated community, and has much to give to those who want to learn. For students, the community work is often integrated into academic course work—an approach called Community Service-Learning pioneered in Canada by Margot Fryer, UBC’s Learning Exchange Director.  The Kensington Cedar Cottage Neighbourhood Committee is a passion for Kim Nulty who works with the landscape crews in Plant Operations and for her husband Jeff who is a graduate of Landscape Architecture at UBC and works as a landscape designer in Plant Operations as well. They have been involved in the visioning process for their neighbourhood which has led to the start-up of many community groups. They played an active role in the Kensington Park Redesign Committee and in various initiatives to green their community. Our  5  UBC staff is found everywhere in the Lower Mainland and in the Okanagan, making a difference to the communities in which they live, including of course, right here in University Town.  Here it is:  Through the First Nations House of Learning, UBC facilitates the participation of aboriginal students at the University, and assists them during their studies. For over twenty-five years, the House of Learning has also run summer youth programs for Aboriginal high school students, to encourage their studies and to encourage them to consider higher education. Other programmes and Faculties are also working hard to support First Nations. In July 2006, 15 new Educational Doctorate students began a programme in Educational Studies. This cohort is focusing on “Leadership with Aboriginal Education”. This program is the only one of its kind in Canada. Of the 15 students, 12 are Aboriginal. But we must do more and better. As a clear signal of the importance of UBC’s relationship with First Nations, I am announcing today the creation of a new position at the heart of university governance. UBC will soon have its first Special Advisor to the President on Aboriginal Affairs.  Here it is; it is yours.  Together we, as students, staff, faculty members, alumni, and governors, have inherited a treasure: the treasure of research and learning, the treasure of teaching, the treasure of knowledge inherited and new-won. It is our obligation to do our utmost to pass on that treasure with more added than when it was passed to us.  I am deeply honoured that the Board of Governors has entrusted me with the task of helping to build this university. I say “helping to build” for I reiterate that universities are collaborative ventures. No single person is the repository of  6  hope for major social institutions like universities. President Wesbrook was singular, even bloody-minded in driving the creation of UBC, but even he was not alone. The first cohort of teachers and students set academic standards that were worthy of emulation.  Students were of course crucial in ensuring that Wesbrook’s vision would come alive. Their march out to Point Grey on the Great Trek of 1922 was an eloquent political statement of need and hope that resonated with the ambitions of the British Columbians of that era. With much cajoling and no small delay, the Government of this Province wisely invested in the future by providing the muchneeded seed money for those first tiny budgets of the University. More recently, the Government of British Columbia was instrumental in the creation of UBC Okanagan. The Province has long been the fundamental partner to UBC – and continues so today. In recent times the federal government too has invested significantly in post-secondary education across the country. Double cause for thanks.  At the very foundation of the university, Wesbrook’s partners extended far beyond his academic colleagues and government. One of his chief supporters and principal advisors was the eminent forester H.R. MacMillan who would come to play a central role in the economic development of BC, and would be an early and generous benefactor to the University. The initial library collection was amassed through gifts from Wesbrook’s medical friends including Sir William Osler. Philanthropy continues to be crucial to the pursuit of excellence at UBC, and we owe much to the wisdom, foresight and generosity of recent benefactors. Earlier this week we announced a million dollar gift from the law firm Ferris and Company for the Law Faculty. Just yesterday I announced a six million dollar gift from Dr Charles Fipke for UBC Okanagan. Thanks due again.  I must also signal a particular partnership that was central to the creation of UBC: the partnership with other universities. Lacking any library holdings to speak of,  7  President Wesbrook asked his friend J.T. Gerould, the librarian at the University of Minnesota, to take a leave of absence from his job to tour Europe and collect books to bring to the new university in British Columbia. The University of Minnesota agreed to allow Gerould to take on the temporary assignment. Thanks due again.  Given my own history, I am delighted to recall another university partnership that was even more important to UBC, indeed to higher education in BC as a whole – that is the partnership with McGill University in Montreal. As many of you will know, both UBC and the University of Victoria were rooted in colleges created by McGill to bring higher education closer to the people of the new province of British Columbia. This history is instructive in at least two ways for the presentday UBC. First, Canadian universities simply must cooperate if we are all to thrive. This need is especially urgent in what has become a global search for outstanding people and world-changing ideas. Second, BC has never had to go it alone. The Rockies may be a geological watershed boundary, but they are politically and socially penetrable. The University of British Columbia was founded as an expression of a local need for higher education, but from the moment of its inception, it was linked to the rest of Canada and it was linked internationally. Hence Wesbrook’s famous injunction that UBC was to be “a Provincial University without provincialism”.  Today, we might want to extend that metaphor, to account for UBC’s remarkable position in the world. Let UBC be a Provincial University without petty provincialism; a national university without crass nationalism; and a global university without thoughtless deference to the rhetoric of globalization. I wish the same for all of Canada’s major research universities.  To be without provincialism is to resist demands that would limit our vision to one that merely satisfies already identified local needs. Wesbrook wanted UBC to be a “people’s university” but he had respect for the people, not condescension. To  8  be of the people is to listen and to respond, of course, but it is also to engage and to challenge. Vancouver has made great strides as an inclusive city that welcomes new communities and that reduces physical barriers for the disabled. But research from UBC tells us that Canadian cities still have a way to go before we can claim to be truly inclusive societies and sustainable communities. We need to learn from Kim Schonert-Reichl’s work on moral development and social education, from the studies of Martin Brokenleg on kids at risk, and from Bill Rees’ groundbreaking research on our ecological footprint.  British Columbia is, right now, an economic success story. The extractive industries are doing well, but research from UBC helps us to understand how to address threats to those industries, and how to diversify the BC economy. Armillaria root disease is a fungus that is particularly damaging to the Interior Cedar-Hemlock zone. Profs Michelle Cleary and Bart van der Kamp have identified resistance mechanisms in western red cedar. Meanwhile, Prof. Terry Snutch’s research at UBC’s Michael Smith Laboratories led to the discovery of NMED-160, a compound with enormous promise as a powerful painkiller that is likely to be especially beneficial to sufferers of chronic pain. Prof. Snutch is cofounder of Neuromed Pharmaceuticals, which in partnership with Merck Phamaceuticals, is moving to the full commercialization of NMED-160, a research spin-off success story. The public will benefit directly from this UBCbased research, as will the BC economy.  UBC is the home to thousands of the brightest students that BC has to offer; it is the primary source of leadership for Vancouver, for the Okanagan, for British Columbia today and tomorrow. But it is much more than that: it is a crucible in which the future success of our local society is tested. It is a source of new ideas, like the Learning Exchange, like Ray Cole’s work on green building practice. It is a principal site where received wisdom is challenged. That is what a people’s university must be.  9  A national university is one that aspires to contribute productively to the great national debates, that attracts students, staff and faculty members from across the country, that links fruitfully with researchers at other Canadian institutions, and around the world. I believe that UBC needs to be pressed to do more in this regard. I was surprised to discover that in the entering undergraduate class at UBC this year, 12 percent of the students come from outside Canada, but only 8 percent from provinces outside British Columbia. If we do not do a better job amongst Canada’s universities in furthering inter-provincial student mobility we will reap the consequences: regions that do not understand each other, provinces that perceive themselves to be isolated, the lack of those personal connections that make a truly national politics and society possible. I will encourage our student recruiters to increase the number of out-of province applications, so that over the next three years we can move to balance the number of international and out-of-province entering undergraduate students. At the same time, our continuing primary responsibilities will be to educate the future leaders of this province, and to make this institution available to all qualified British Columbians.  UBC must also play an even more active leadership role in national research consortia We already contribute to twenty of the twenty-one national Networks of Centres of Excellence – the highest level of participation by any university in the country. We should move with confidence to increase our participation at the national level in areas such as public health, democratic institutions and multiculturalism, and climate change and biodiversitiy, where UBC has great research and teaching strength. None of this is likely to descend into crass nationalism in the case of UBC; if anything, the need is to place the national perspective even more firmly on a radar screen that sometimes seems to have been strangely bifurcated between the local and the international, with only a faintly dotted screen where the rest of Canada is concerned.  10  UBC has already committed itself in the Trek 2010 Plan to the nurturing of global citizens. The view across the Pacific is steady and sure – although it may have to be more focused in the years ahead. UBC is already Canada’s Global University. The challenge for UBC is similar to that facing all great non-American research universities: how to contribute globally and how to learn from international colleagues and students without the resources available to the top US universities? Here is a place where stronger mutual support amongst leading Canadian universities is crucial. In the period after September 11th, 2001, the number of international graduate students seeking places outside the United States increased dramatically. The United Kingdom and Germany benefited, and now each hosts twelve percent of all international students. Australia, a much smaller country than Canada in terms of population, also benefited, and now welcomes ten percent of all international students. The Canadian share of the global market for graduate students hardly grew at all, and stands at a lowly one percent. Top Canadian universities, private foundations and governments must work to address this signal failure. We need to strengthen our support schemes for outstanding international graduate students. All graduate students bring incredible vigour to university research; they are the basis for our future success as a knowledge society. International graduate students additionally bring fresh insights, skills and international networks into Canada; in the long term they bring important political connections and market opportunities. We cannot wait for governments to solve the problem of Canada’s underperformance in the global competition for brainpower. I will challenge UBC and some of our sister universities to work together to recruit, support and retain the best graduate students that the world has to offer. Our country has strong universities and UBC is one of the best – we must do better in bringing the world to Canada.  In speaking of global citizenship and a global role for the university, we must not be constrained by the rhetoric of globalization. Yes, global market opportunities  11  are greater than ever, as is global economic competition. Scholars in the Sauder School, the Department of Economics and in other parts of the university are working hard to make sense of this new hyper-competitive world. UBC’s work on international transportation economics and policy is locally, nationally and globally relevant. But global citizenship is about more than looking for exciting jobs in Hong Kong, London or New York. It is about more than building-up BC and Canada’s international trade. If we link the UBC mission statement’s promotion of global citizenship to the commitment to build a civil and sustainable society, we can see that a global university can only exist as a sustainable university, environmentally and socially.  As global citizens, we face difficult personal choices about how we live, what resources we consume, what we give back to the communities that pay for our work. So I hope that UBC will continue to claim the language of the global, while recognizing that such language is a continual challenge not only to the world but to ourselves, as individual global citizens and as an institution. I will encourage UBC to extend the community-service learning concept pioneered in the Learning Exchange to our international partnerships with other universities and with civil society in the developing world. I will also encourage a stronger set of linkages between UBC’s Campus Sustainability Office, already the leader in Canada, and UBC researchers in sustainable buildings and sustainable communities, so that we can share what we learn on campus with universities around the globe.  Here it is – in the memorable words of UBC’s Trek 2010 Vision: “The University of British Columbia, aspiring to be one of the world’s best universities, will prepare students to become exceptional global citizens, promote the values of a civil and sustainable society, and conduct outstanding research to serve the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world.”  12  At its heart, every institution is people. When I first arrived in Vancouver, a radio host asked me whether I was a Mayor or a CEO. Too often when citizens think of this great university, they think of the physical beauty of our campuses on Point Grey and in the Okanagan, they think of big construction projects, they think of the scope of UBC and of its 1.8 billion dollar budget. Let’s change that. In all our public discourse, let’s talk about the people who make up UBC: The dedicated staff, the incredibly accomplished faculty members who are the intellectual heart of all our research and teaching endeavours, the wonderfully supportive alumni. Above all, let’s talk about the students who are, after all, the very reason that each of us is here.  Here it is. Pasha Bains is pursuing his Ph.D. in Education. He is a top student and a star athlete, having led the UBC Thunderbirds to their first Canada West perfect season in 22 years. But he does much more – he founded the non-profit coaching programme “Drive Basketball” to help students in grades three to twelve develop sporting skills and attitudes, build strength, and acquire life skills such as teamwork, goal setting and reliability. Nabeela Khan is a 4th year undergraduate, focusing on cell biology and genetics, with a minor in anthropology. She came to UBC from Brunei and Pakistan, and was the first elected President of the International Students Association. She is currently pursuing a work term at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at St Paul’s Hospital where she is assessing accessibility to HIV therapies for communities in the developing world.  Pasha and Nabeela deserve the best learning environment that we can provide, given the limits of our human imaginations and our resources. Every one of our students deserves nothing less. Concretely that means that when we make decisions in the university about how we will spend money, we must always ask  13  how that decision will affect the teaching and learning opportunities for our students.  Today, I am announcing a special fund for the enhancement of teaching and learning at UBC. This fund is created from proceeds of the University Town development, now in the Trek Endowment. In each of the next three years one million dollars will be devoted to a pilot project involving the recruitment of postdoctoral Teaching Fellows who will be matched with top university researchers in undergraduate classrooms. This will encourage world class researchers to connect more closely with undergraduate teaching in the context of collaboratively planned classes. The post-doctoral Teaching Fellows will benefit from mentorship in teaching in the areas of their academic strength. As a result of this initiative, between 40 and 50 new courses or new sections will be created to enhance undergraduate students’ learning experience. Faculties with large undergraduate enrollments will be invited to submit proposals for their involvement with this initiative in January 2007.  I further pledge that in all our planning and in our financial decision making while I am President, the question of impact upon teaching and learning opportunities for students will be foremost in my thoughts. That will mean making some hard, hard choices. No university can do everything well. That is especially true of publicly-funded universities that do not have discretion over key sources of revenue. So a real commitment to enhancing the teaching and learning opportunities for our students will mean focusing our efforts. It will mean choosing not to do things that we cannot deliver to UBC’s standards of research and teaching excellence. It will mean phasing in or staging initiatives where the goal is central to our Trek 2010 plan, but where our resources are not immediately adequate to the task.  I do not pretend that any of this will be obvious or easy. But one of the things that drew me to UBC was my belief that this University had done something  14  remarkable: it had worked collectively to articulate a vision for the future that was unique and compelling. It had gone a step further to begin to specify the concrete goals that would bring that vision closer to fulfillment. Now I ask you to join me in making the choices that will be required to turn Trek 2010 into a new and exciting reality. If we can do that – and I know that we can – I am confident that we will have built a university worthy of the imagination and sweat of our forebears, a Provincial University without petty provincialism; a national university without crass nationalism; and a global university without thoughtless deference to the rhetoric of globalization. Here it is – the University of British Columbia – it is yours.  Thank you.  15  
1.0108014~Creative education : disruptive innovation : universities role in enhancing social and economic productivity~Gupta, Arvind~ Creative Education; Disruptive Innovation UNIVERSITIES ROLE IN ENHANCING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY   A Vancouver Institute Lecture by Dr. Arvind Gupta, President and Vice-Chancellor University of British Columbia     Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 2 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  I would like to speak tonight about Canada’s performance in a unique international competition; it is the race to be productive. Productivity is not a code-word for working harder. It does not imply industries getting their employees to work longer hours. Productivity is a measure of the value produced for every hour of work. And rising productivity is the key to a rising standard of living. Traditionally, Canada has done reasonably well at raising productivity. We started with a country blessed with abundant natural resources, already a route to creating wealth. But we distinguished ourselves on the productivity front because we focused on having a highly educated populace and, by international Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 3 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  standards, one that is highly innovative. In a 2013 study called The Future of Productivityi, the accounting and management firm Deloitte reported that Canada once ran just behind the United States. In the mid-1980s, our productivity rate was 91% of theirs. But since then we’ve been slipping so that today is it only 78%. While Canadian workers contribute roughly $48 US per-hour-worked toward GDP, Americans produce almost $61 per hour. And the Norwegians churn out value at the rate of $77 per hour. We are not keeping up. Where exactly are we not keeping up? It’s not, as people once thought, that we aren’t working as hard. It’s much more about our ability to innovate. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 4 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Innovations, embedded into the goods and services we produce, spread across our land and around the globe, benefitting not just us but all humankind. It’s a classic win/win: when we do better at the productivity race, everyone benefits. Consider two examples: • In 1921, when Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered how to use insulin to treat diabetes, their innovation changed the future for people all over the world. • During the last 20 years, as Julio Montaner and his team at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS discovered and refined the use of antiretroviral therapy, they helped reduce the AIDS mortality Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 5 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  rate by 90%. Their formulation made these therapies more productive – and we all won. Alas, when we lose at the productivity race, we lose alone. Sure, Canadians still get to use the iPhones and MRI machines that other countries invent, but - if - we - don’t innovate ourselves, our standard of living slides comparatively. Even our natural resources will not save us, if innovators in other countries find a way to bring their resources to market faster and more efficiently, or if they add more value to their resources than we do. So, in our own individual interests, in the national interest and for the sake of all humankind, the productivity race is a competition that we must win. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 6 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The question, of course, is how? There are lots of answers, and lots of experts to expound on the variations. There are corporate strategies and tax measures. Deloitte argues, convincingly, that Canada should spend much more on research, noting that our current investment level puts us in the bottom quartile among our competitors in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – the OECD. For my part, this evening, I want to focus on the human element. I want to look specifically at the capacity and the responsibility that the post-secondary community has: • First, to support innovation immediately and directly; and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 7 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  • Second, to ensure that our students turn into the innovators who will continue to enhance every part of society – in health, in social policy, in environmental sustainability and in advancing economic prosperity. Let’s start by agreeing on the definition of innovation. To innovate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is to “bring in new methods (or) ideas.” The Canadian Academies described innovation with the following schematic. Let me simplify this. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 8 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Here, innovation is creative people, married to smart money, producing solutions to socio-economic challenges. Phrased as a sentence, that seems like a linear process: we nurture creativity; then we link to community; and, together, we reap the benefit. But, in keeping with this image, I suggest that the process is considerably more interactive. Canada’s best post-secondary institutions certainly have an advanced capacity to cultivate creativity – in students, among researchers and in the larger community. But the richest returns may come in the interplay among students, faculty, industry and civil society. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 9 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Specifically, I’d like to argue that creativity flows from a wealth of experiences, some of them from formal education, but many of them opportunistic. That being the case, in order to nurture and leverage creativity, we must maximize the opportunity for students and faculty to enjoy a diversity of experience, in and out of the classroom, in and out of the lab, within and amongst different disciplines – and in constant connection to community. We then complete a perfect loop: by working in the context of real-world problems our students and researchers enjoy a wide range of new experiences. They connect directly to the very socio-economic challenges we want to address. Our complicated Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 10 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  society and the burgeoning economy then become the very source of our creative energy. * So what is “creativity? Going back to the dictionary, the Oxford defines “creative” as “inventive and imaginative.” This seems clear and simple enough. But there is a trap in the language. Whenever we are invited to think about “the creative arts,” the subject seems limited to the high arts and literature. This covers a narrow section of the academy and seems to exclude science altogether – as if the Internet was invented by people who are NOT creative. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 11 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The evidence actually suggests that the richest creative veins are to be found not in one branch of the academy or the other, but in the connections among them all. Innovation most often arises when we combine the rigors of discipline with the delights, distractions and provocations of art and entertainment. And when I say “entertainment,” I don’t just mean music and movies or even poetry and provocative fiction. The definition can apply to any experience that its subject enjoys.  This makes intuitive sense: In order to innovate – say, as an economist, a computer scientist, a physician or an architect – we must first master the fundamentals of the specialty. We must be rigorous and disciplined. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 12 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  But the inspiration for true creativity is unlikely to be found in the textbook; that’s what people mean when they suggest we “think outside the box.” There is also anecdotal evidence for this view. For example, UBC’s own Nobel Laureate Michael Smith once told the former UBC President Martha Piper that he got many of his best ideas not in the laboratory but in the Orpheum Theatre – he found inspiration in the ethereal strains of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. In an interview in 1929, Albert Einstein made a similar suggestion. He said, “If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I live my daydreams in music. I Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 13 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  see my life in terms of music. I get most of my joy in life out of music.”1 Einstein told his friend, the Japanese violinist Shinichi Suzuki, “The theory of relativity occurred to me by intuition, and music is the driving force behind this intuition. My parents had me study the violin from the time I was 6. My new discovery is the result of musical perception.”2 There is a suggestion here of some kind of biological interdisciplinarity – of an advanced capacity that emerges when different parts of the brain work together.                                                  1 Albert Einstein, quoted in Alice Calaprice, and Trevor Lipscombe, Albert Einstein: A Biography (Greenwood Press, 2005), 5. 2 Robert & Michele Root-Bernstein, "The Art & Craft of Science," Educational Leadership (February 2013), 16; Shinichi Suzuki, Nurtured by Love (1969), 90. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 14 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The benefit of art to the scientist is well-researched. For example, Robert and Michele Root-Bernstein at Michigan State University put together a team of researchers to test the theory. Looking at Nobel Prize winners, the team pored over obituary notices, memoirs and biographies – searching for evidence that Nobel inspiration may have flowed from an avocation in the “arts or crafts.” The team set a high bar for their test. It wasn’t enough that a laureate had an impressive collection of art or music. The shortlist included only those laureates who “described themselves or were described by biographers as being a painter, photographer, actor, performer, composer, poet, dancer, craftsman, Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 15 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  glassblower, etc. ... or if there was direct evidence of artwork, photographs, sculptures, compositions, poems, (or) performances ….” The findings were remarkable: 94 per cent of Nobel laureates were actively involved in an arts or crafts avocation.  Nobel prize winners in general were: • twice as likely to be a musician, composer, or conductor as the average scientist; • three times as likely to have arts and crafts hobbies; • seven times more likely to be a painter, sculptor, woodworker, glassblower; Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 16 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  • 12 times more likely to write poetry, plays or novels; and • 22 times more likely to be a dancer, actor, magician or other performer.3 Frederick Banting, for example, was a painter, who regularly chummed around with A.Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris.4 Here’s Banting landscape – it’s actually called “Northern Landscape” – very much in the Group of Seven style. The counter influence – of science over art – is less well-documented, but the case seems equally compelling. Books and movies are filled with examples of science in art. And many artists have found                                                  3 Root-Bernstein, et al., 54. 4 Bliss, Michael. "Banting: A Biography," Toronto: University of Toronto Press Incorporated, 1992. Page 51. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 17 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  inspiration in science. For example, the author Arthur Miller has marshalled convincing evidence that, while Einstein was humming his way through the theory of relativity, Pablo Picasso was reading and thinking about Einstein’s scientific preoccupation – time and simultaneity – while he was working on his revolutionary cubist painting, Les Demoiselle  d’Avignon.5 The point is that neither discipline is more creative than the other. Rather, whatever your specialty, a diversity of pursuits – a rich variety of inputs – is more likely to engender a creative output. From Leonardo da Vinci to Chris Hadfield, the polymaths have                                                  5 Miller, Arthur, “Einstein, Picass: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Chaos, Basic Books, 2001. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 18 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  demonstrated, again and again, the benefits of a broad, interdisciplinary and ongoing education. * So much for the alchemy of creativity; what of the strategy to nurture innovative research? How do we leverage what we know about creativity to cultivate research excellence? Well, if we accept that creativity flows from a wealth of experience, then we must ensure that researchers are immersed in diverse and stimulating environments. This notion runs contrary to a traditional view of what constitutes the richest environment for academic thought. There was, for centuries, a contention that Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 19 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  academics did their best work when left alone and that universities functioned best as ivory towers or, at the very least, as cloisters safely removed from the bustle and distraction of the wider world.  In this model, Einstein was the quintessential philosopher scientist: patent clerk by day; transformative physicist by night. We’re led to believe that when he was developing the Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein had no master other than curiosity.  Einstein himself once said, and I quote: “There are certain occupations, even in modern society, which entail living in isolation and do not require great physical or intellectual effort. Such Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 20 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  occupations as the service of lighthouses and lightships come to mind. Would it not be possible to place young people who wish to think about scientific problems, especially of a mathematical or philosophical nature, in such occupations? Very few young people with such ambitions have, even during the most productive period of their lives, the opportunity to devote themselves undisturbed for any length of time to problems of a scientific nature.” 6  Sir Isaac Newton conducted his best research in a similarly “pure” environment. The archetypal cloistered academic, Newton came to a revolutionary                                                  6 Einstein, Albert, and Alice Calaprice. The Ultimate Quotable Einstein. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 2011., pp 102-03 Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 21 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  understanding of gravity without venturing much past the apple orchard outside Trinity College Cambridge. In an essay entitled, “The Diatribe of Doctor Akakia,” Voltaire praised Newton as “a remarkably stationary man, the embodiment of spiritual and scholarly solitude.”7 By contrast, Voltaire dismissed, Pierre Louis Maupertuis, then-president of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin, for wandering the world, pendulums in hand, measuring the shape of the earth to test Newton’s theory of gravity. Voltaire sniffed, and I quote “You have confirmed in the most boring places                                                  7 Schaffer, 244. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 22 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  what Newton knew without ever leaving home.” End quote. This notion of scholarly reclusiveness, however, collapses under scrutiny. Einstein wasn’t living in a lighthouse, idly contemplating Newtonian concepts of space and time. He was spending his days in the patent office in Bern, Switzerland, applying himself to the industrial preoccupations of the day.  At the turn of the 20th century, one of the chief such issues was the problem of how to make distant clocks tell the same time. Walking daily past streets clocks such as this one, Einstein would have known that, from August 1, 1890, they had all ticked in relative synchrony, thanks to a new network of electromagnets Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 23 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  and telegraph cables. As Peter Galison writes in the book, Einstein’s Clocks, “all around him, literally, was the burgeoning fascination with electrocoordinated time.”8 This was serious business – a matter of life and death. In an increasingly crowded railway world, what may begin as a theoretical question about the simultaneity of distant events can resolve, suddenly, as a crash at a railway crossing. So, Einstein the patent clerk was not daydreaming about pure physics; he was trying to make sense of hundreds of applications related to electric timekeeping.9 He was wrestling with the partial                                                  8 Galison, "Einstein's Clocks," 375. 9 Galison, "Einstein's Clocks," 368. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 24 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  differential equations that Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell had produced in a 1865 paper, “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.” Maxwell’s equations implied different values for the electromagnetic currents produced when a magnet interacted with a coil – one value for when the coil was in motion, another for when the magnet was in motion with respect to the ether. But Einstein knew that, experimentally, the same values were produced regardless of whether the magnet was moving or still.10                                                  10 Peter Galison, “Einstein’s Clocks: The Place of Time,” Critical Enquiry 26, no. 2 (2000), 357 Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 25 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  While other physicists tried to resolve this contradiction by experimenting with the way time was altered in different reference frames, Einstein redefined the nature of time altogether.11  The important point, for this discussion, is that his innovation was informed by and applied to his day-to-day work. According to Galison, Einstein’s 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” even looked like a patent application. * What then of Newton the homebody?                                                  11 Ibid., 374. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 26 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  In his paper, “Newton on the Beach: The Information Order of Principia Mathematica,” the historian Simon Schaffer confirms that Newton barely budged from Trinity College Cambridge after his appointment there, at age 18, in 1661. But the record also shows that Newton was one of the best-connected hermits on the planet. The calculations that he used to develop his laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation depended upon observations and records that were made all over the world.12 From mariners and missionaries, Newton had information on tides in the East Indies, the Straits of                                                  12 Schaffer, 244-245.

Observations on the lengths of pendulums (essential for the determining the shape of the earth and the force of gravity) came from Europe, South America and from slaving ports on the west coast of Africa. This is a map of trade routes of the day, and the stars indicate the source points I just mentioned. All of these observations travelled back to Newton through the Republic of Letters – a sort of 17th century internet – and from the Global Imperial Trade Networks.                                                  13 Schaffer 253-256. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 28 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Neither was Newton at arm’s length from these networks. He had one of the largest investments in the East India Company (around 10,000 pounds, or about $1.5 million in today’s dollars) and he lost twice that amount in the notorious South Sea Company. His interests in time and distance were more than theoretical.  So, Einstein lived in the world and dreamed about solitude. Newton lived in solitude but dreamed of the world. Both men applied themselves to some of the most fundamental questions of science. And both had direct interest in the applications of their own research.  Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 29 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  * Yet there were still those, before Einstein’s time and since, who argued for a separation between the academy and the community – even between the great researchers of this generation and the up-and-coming talent of the next. For example, Henry Augustus Rowland, the first President of the American Physical Society, rose at the 1883 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science to condemn the new trend to better connect institutional researchers to societal partners. Rowland said, “A ‘true’ university need(s) well-paid professorships and well-appointed laboratories, ... ‘pure’ by virtue of being a refuge for Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 30 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  research and a preserve from the pressures of the outside world.”14 If we were to accept this view unreservedly, what could UBC – or any of the world’s great research universities – promise to an ambitious student? As it is, we offer an opportunity to interact with some of the foremost researchers in the world. UBC’s research excellence gives our students immediate access to the latest discoveries and revelations. There is assuredly a place for research chairs and professorships, and I would never deny our students the inspiration, enthusiasm and cutting-edge                                                  1414 Lucier, Paul, "The Origins of Pure and Applied Science in Gilded Age America," Isis 103, no. 3 (2012): 530-531. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 31 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  knowledge that you can only get from professors who are innovating at the very top of their field. As for being “a preserve from the pressures of the outside world,” that is antithetical to what I believe UBC or any top flight international research institution should be. We see in all the foregoing examples that research is more powerful when it has relevance and that researchers are more creative not when they take refuge from the world, but when they live in it. Great researchers are inspired by their students, by their surroundings, by the music they hear or play, by the issues that challenge their society. If we are to be innovative, if we are to leverage our research capacity to increase the productivity of our community and our Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 32 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  country, we will do so by embracing the pressures of the outside world. So, if we are to cultivate research excellence and maximize our own capacity for innovation, we must do three things - - -  1.We must support the research enterprise at every level; 2.We must integrate it wherever possible with other elements of the academy; and 3.We must promote engagement – among our faculty, between faculty and students and, critically, between the academy and the community. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 33 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The modern research university is not a refuge; it is a hub – a nexus. It’s a place where people go to learn, to think, to be entertained and provoked. It’s a place where industry and civil society can go for help in answering the pressing questions of the day. If Einstein were around today, he would be no more likely than he was in 1905 to choose work in an isolated lighthouse. He would find somewhere like UBC and he would have the time of his life. * So, there will be no simple first-year course in originality or imagination. Creativity is complicated and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 34 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  it arises from the interconnections of every part of the academy.  And there is no secret lab to which we may all remove ourselves – to think and to innovate. Our best discoveries – our most transformative revelations – will come in the complex interplay among disciplines and among those who think and those who do. How do we most effectively deliver that innovative energy beyond the academy? And how do we tap into the needs, the demands and the creative energy of the wider community to inform and inspire our own work? Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 35 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  A first step is to acknowledge that, as a nation, this is something that we don’t do well enough now. The Deloitte report I mentioned earlier notes:  “Canada’s science and engineering academics perform admirably in international publication rankings, but our performance in the global intellectual property statistics suggests that many of our great ideas are failing to make their way out of the lab.” As an aside, I am happy to say that, at UBC at least, that’s not the case. Among Canadian universities, the C.D. Howe Institute reported in 2013 that UBC ranks first in total patents, U.S. patents and income from licensed intellectual property. And from 1991 to 2010, we ranked second in licenses, inventions and start-ups. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 36 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  We claimed 139 patents and launched 18 spin-off companies in the past three years alone. Our research impact is estimated at $6 billion annually. But Canada exhibits an unacceptable gap between university research and industrial innovation. The Royal Society of Canada put out a position paper just this month entitled, “Driving Growth Through Research: The importance of research for Canada’s future in the world knowledge economy.” In it, the Society notes that Canadian business investment in research and development is among the lowest of the industrialized economies.15                                                  15 Royal Society of Canada, Driving Growth Through Research: The importance of research for Canada’s future in the world knowledge economy, Retrieved October 9, 2014 from: http://www.rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/PP_Driving%20Growth_EN.pdf Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 37 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  The Science, Technology and Innovation Council, on which I sit, said something similar in a State of the Nation report in 2010: “Economists are increasingly focusing on a lack of innovation in Canada as a contributor to poor productivity performance.”16 One of the problems appears to be that Canada lacks an innovation culture. It all starts with talent. Whether in civil society and industry – in the social sciences and humanities and in the hard sciences and engineering – innovation comes most frequently from the most highly qualified people. And yet the Conference Board of Canada reports that, among our OECD competitors, only Japan graduates                                                  16 Science, Technology and Innovation Council, Imagination to Innovation: Building Canadian Paths to Prosperity, Retrieved Oct. 10, 2014 from: http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/vwapj/10-059_IC_SotN_Rapport_EN_WEB_INTERACTIVE.pdf/$FILE/10-059_IC_SotN_Rapport_EN_WEB_INTERACTIVE.pdf Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 38 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  fewer PhD students per capita than Canada.17 We educate half as many as the U.K. or Germany and perhaps one-third of Switzerland. Then, compared to the U.S., Canadian companies hire fewer PhD graduates and pay them less – which the Conference Board suggests as an explanation for why more Canadians don’t commit to doctoral programs. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: fewer PhDs; fewer companies hiring PhDs; less industrial innovation; fewer opportunities for students. Students need to know there will be a return for the time and money that they invest in furthering their                                                  17 Conference Board of Canada, How Canada Performs.

And businesses and civil society institutions need to understand the potential advantage of engaging – and engaging with – highly qualified people. In the current situation, it appears that lack of familiarity is breeding disinterest – to everyone’s disadvantage.  We’re especially conscious of this at UBC. British Columbia runs behind the national average in the number of PhDs we produce per capita. We need to do more – and we will need close community partnerships in order to improve our performance. In looking at solutions to this conundrum, I could start by pointing out areas where students and the prospective employers are already well connected. In Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 40 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Education, for example, we would never send a new teacher into the classroom without first giving them a structured opportunity to test their knowledge and skills. Neither would we send a nurse, a doctor or a physiotherapist into the work world without hands-on experience. Integration in the fields of health and medicine is something that UBC does extensively: we have deep affiliations with eleven (11) teaching hospitals and the BC Cancer Agency. But it’s also a field in which we are determined to do better. We started a few years ago with a distributed medical program that now educates and trains physicians in Vancouver, Kelowna, Victoria and Prince Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 41 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  George. This extends some of UBC’s greatest capacities not just into the community but to the far reaches of the province. We are also asserting our leadership in medical research. Consider, for example, the The Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, which opened this year under founding director Dr. Max Cynader. This facility unites under one roof UBC’s research and clinical expertise in neuroscience, psychiatry and neurology. Here you see world-leading treatment, teaching and research. You see some of the best practitioners in the country – and the world – inspiring and being inspired by a generation of students who get a chance to apply a theoretical understanding to an Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 42 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  unfolding reality. Those students also bring a degree of originality, ingenuity and imagination that inspires, challenges and energizes their mentors. And everyone is driven by real-world challenges that, up close, demand a solution. This model – of experiential learning and two-way communication between the academy and the working world – has also found a foothold in other disciplines. Our Engineering co-op program, for example, is the largest in western Canada and one of its greatest outputs is success stories. First, from a student perspective, 90% of those who participate in a co-op placement wind up with a permanent job with their co-op employer. Students Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 43 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  are clearly getting the experience they need – and they are proving it to prospective employers along the way. They also become the engine for innovation. Consider Radu Postole, a self-described “mediocre student” until his first co-op term with a German research firm called GKSS. Thanks to this experience, Postole said, “It suddenly dawned on me how all the academic learning is applicable in the real world.” Postole spent the rest of his study time on the Dean’s honour role. After working with UBC’s own Structured Surface Physics Lab on an alternative energy project called Solar Canopy, he leveraged his well-refined technical skills to get his first “real” job with a start-up Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 44 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  company called SunCentral, helping advance the UBC solar lighting technology into a marketed product. Another multidisciplinary model for community integration is called Mitacs, a national, non-profit organization that manages and funds research and training programs for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. I was the CEO and Scientific Director for the past 15 years. Mitacs is fundamentally an engagement mechanism, working with 60 universities, thousands of employers in the private and public sectors, and with every provincial jurisdiction in the country.  For example, the Mitacs Accelerate program facilitates research internships for graduate students and Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 45 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  postdoctoral fellows with industries across all disciplines. One such student was Reynald Hoskinson, a Mitacs intern who helped the Vancouver-based Recon Industries develop its Heads-up Display ski goggles. Based on the display characteristics of fighter-jet face-shields, Recon’s GPS-activated goggles feature an LCD screen that tells you your speed, positioning, distance travelled. And on the distance-travelled question, Hoskinson is now Recon’s Research and Development Manager. This is a typical result for Mitacs, which has arranged some 10,000 collaborative research projects, boosting R&D at Canadian companies, enabling established Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 46 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  researchers to apply their skills, and providing training and experience for our most highly-educated students. Mitacs – is – an – innovation – engine:  14% per cent of Mitacs interns started their own company – that’s twice the usual rate for graduate students. 1. Mitacs interns were placed into 2,500 jobs, 900 of which were brand new positions. This indicates that we are making a measurable difference in how many PhDs are finding employment in industry and how many companies are coming to understand the value of researchers with this level of competence. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 47 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  2. 97% of Mitacs’ industrial partners said the Accelerate experience made them even more interested in collaborating with academic researchers;  3. while 74% said they now intend to increase their investment in R&D. And thanks to their hands-on experience,  4. A decade out, Mitacs graduates are earning an average $10,000 a year more than their graduate-level colleagues. Given this experience, one of the first commitments I made when I took over as UBC President was to double the number of experiential learning opportunities on Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 48 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  and off campus through internships and co-op programs. This, however, is just one example of the kind of community engagement that must become even more commonplace. It’s just one example of the research and educational innovations that we plan for UBC in the years to come.  The pursuit of creativity, the support of interdisciplinarity and the goal of more effective and complete community integration will demand attention throughout the academy. Because there is no simplistic secret of success, no magic formula – except this: Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 49 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  1. Creativity flows from a wealth of experience and is best engendered with a broad, varied and lifelong education – of the heart as well as the head; 2. In order to nurture and leverage the creative energies of our students and faculty, we must maximize their opportunity to enjoy a diversity of experience, within the university and in constant and intimate connection to community. 3. Every individual – and any organization – that joins in a close collaboration between the academy and the community is likely to reap enormous rewards. Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 50 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Here, we return to the question of productivity. It is important to remember that this is not, exclusively and narrowly, an economic measure. There is a great deal of good, in Canada and the world that cannot be expressed within the computations of Gross Domestic Product. Creativity, innovation and research excellence are certainly important to economic prosperity, but equally so to the quality of Canadian justice, to our personal health and social well-being and to our environmental health and sustainability. Canada begins with a huge advantage – this vast, beautiful, rich country. We have built one of the most admired societies on the planet, with an education system that stands amongst the best in the world.  Vancouver Institute Lecture Outline  October 25, 2014 51 UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Our universities are already engaged in the issues that matter most to all of us. But the more we can immerse ourselves directly in society – the more we can bring the community even closer to the academy – the greater will be our chances for real innovation, that will benefit us all. I invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Thank you.                                                  i Currie, B., Scott, L., Deloitte, The Future of Productivity: A Wake-up Call for Canadian Companies, Deloitte, 2013.

1.0102630~Leading change from where you are~Toope, Stephen J.~Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 1 of 22   Leading Change From Where You Are   Delivered at various partner universities in China Professor Stephen J. Toope  President and Vice-Chancellor  The University of British Columbia   SJT: Thank you, Professor HU Lingyun.  I am absolutely delighted to be here in Beijing at Beihang University.  UBC has a longstanding relationship with Beihang University and just last month President HUAI visited The University of British Columbia with a delegation of your faculty.   HOW I CAME TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY  While it is certainly great to be here, it was no easy task to get here.  It involved taxis, airport security, long airplane flights, more taxis, and, happily, a bit of walking.  And this is just my individual route here.  If we consider the various journeys that were involved in bringing all of us together at this one Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 22   time and place, it is rather a remarkable choice we have made, isn’t it?   To gather physically together in this one particular place.   These days, there are many alternatives to physical meetings that can save time, effort, money and resources.  Many of these methods are regularly used and actively encouraged as alternatives to physical meetings by my university and, I imagine, by your own.   But let me repeat that I am very glad to be here today…to be here, right here, in this place, and how glad I am that you are also here, in this shared physical place with me.  That we are here together.  I have already derived a great deal of benefit from being here, having personal conversations with many of you, and achieving important milestones—benefits I might not have experienced if our meetings had been virtual.  Without in any way discounting the newer communication tools at our disposal, I want to celebrate the fact that we as individuals, and we as our respective institutions, benefit from one another and will continue to do so in ways that are uniquely dependent upon the physical places our institutions hold on earth and Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 22   upon the complex human things that can only happen when we spend time with one another in these places.   I speak of how I arrived here today because it is relevant to my purpose in being here today.  And that is to talk about place and to talk about change.  In particular I want to talk about the way the world is changing, about changes that are occurring and need to occur in our universities in response, and more specifically about the crucial roles a university’s physical place and its sense of place play in this changing world.  THREE DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE  It’s fashionable these days to talk about how much our world is changing; but ours is not the only age to experience massive change.  The middle part of the Han Dynasty saw the development of Silk Road trading routes, and the establishment of the Imperial Academy Taixue.  These had a transformative effect on the civilizations of China, India, Persia, Europe and Arabia. Certainly the 1500s after Gutenberg and Columbus saw global change economically, socially and intellectually.  The Industrial Revolution with the railroad and telegraph again Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 22   transformed the economy and brought about upheavals in the way people lived, worked, travelled and communicated.   Still, I believe that we have a right to claim that the changes of the present are even more earth-shaking than those that went before, if only because our age of change still includes and builds upon those previous ones, which continue to transform our world.   Like a snowball rolling down a mountain slope we are experiencing an acceleration in the pace of change and a rapid increase in its magnitude.   I invite you to consider three areas in which rapid and deep-seated change is fundamentally shifting our world and how we think about place—our sense of place—within it:  The first is interconnectivity.  Perhaps it has always been true that everything is connected, but now that fact is inescapable and the repercussions nearly instantaneous.  Information travels at or near the speed of light, and no longer just from one person to another, as in the telegraph and telephone, or one to many, as in broadcast radio and television, but many to many, over networks of digital networks.   Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 22   We are all ever more intricately entwined. Interconnectivity is changing how Hollywood and Bollywood make movies, how Hong Kong makes money, how academics conduct and publish their research, how elections are planned and even how insurrections are organized.   Thanks to this interconnectivity, hundreds of millions of people are walking around today with devices enabling access to the sum of all world knowledge, past and present, in their pockets.  (The fact that they may be using this miraculous capability merely to share cute videos of kittens is a sad irony.)   The second area in which change in our world is accelerating directs our attention to the world as earth: Mother Earth.  We may address this vast issue of change with one word: sustainability.  This world, our Earth, is made of matter; and that has always mattered, but never more urgently than now.  We cannot escape the realization that, as environmentalists have been saying for some time, “There is no ‘away.’”   We no longer have the luxury of deluding ourselves that there is a place on earth or in the air where we can dump our exhaust, garbage and chemicals where it won’t matter.   Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 22   When I speak of sustainability I refer to the complex social, economic and scientific issues involved in meeting our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same.  I also refer to the impact of accelerating climate change, which is the result of our inability so far to address these issues.   The third area of change in our world that I want to mention is the sheer mobility of people around it.  I’m speaking of a growing population of creative, highly trained, well-educated and ambitious global citizens who are well informed, internationally engaged and highly mobile.   As with information interconnectivity, this mobility is not so much one-to-many or many-to-one anymore, but many-to-many.   For instance, the number of people receiving advanced education in China tripled in the first decade of this century and is likely to double again in the next 10 to 15 years.  Minds that a few decades ago might not have had an opportunity to advance at all, are now getting a chance at education.  More than ever that chance begins at home, and more than ever the opportunity presents itself to continue the voyage of their lives anywhere in the world.  Competition is heating up.  Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 22   Countries, regions, industries and institutions are competing for talent.  Even the problems facing our world are in competition for this highly mobile resource of minds, the minds needed to address these problems.  Interconnectivity, sustainability, and mobility: the excitation (the literal and figurative heating up) of ideas, of earth and of people:  these three are all at play today, interacting with a host of other issues and changes affecting our world, from intractable disease to economic fragility to pandemic poverty to political instability—a veritable mob of issues and problems demanding our attention.  How are we as academic institutions, both independently and together, responding to these vectors of change?  What is our ability to respond?  Moreover, what is our responsibility with regard to ideas, to the earth and to people?  It is essential in some ways that we hold firm, that we not abandon our deepest principles.  However, it is also essential, of course, that we do change, to adapt to a changing world.   What is it that guides us between the two horns of this dilemma?   As we change, and as we stay the same, it is our continual responsibility to effect change in the world: change for the better.  Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 22    Universities have always maintained a sensitive balance between being a part of the world and being somewhat apart from it.  As we work hard (and we must) to help guide our changing world and adjust ourselves to its changes, I believe it is vital that we change this balance of part of and apart from without losing its dynamic tension.   DEMONSTRATING THE POSSIBLE IN PLACE   Universities are places of change.  They always have been.  We have been the inspiration, location and provocation of social, economic, technological and cultural evolution for a thousand years or more.   And yet only recently have universities, as places of change, begun to make full use of their physical presence on earth—their sociology, geography and ecology—within their mandate to serve society locally and globally.   My own university, The University of British Columbia, is of a geographic size and population comparable to a mid-sized town.  The land we occupy is inseparable from the rest of the world, yet we also happen to be the sole owner-occupiers of all our own utilities and the Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 9 of 22   stewards of a rather large and complex urban community separate from the city of Vancouver and the rest of Canada.   Being just somewhat apart from the rest of the world we have the liberty, and I would now suggest the responsibility, to use our basic operations, administration and infrastructure—our physical place—to test, model and demonstrate new approaches to sustainability that are consistent with our research agenda.   We have been calling this responsibility the University as a Living Laboratory.  We are able to use our position as just somewhat apart from the political and economic realities of the rest of the world to “demonstrate the possible” in a way that enables change to “scale upward” from initial research and prototyping to actual, large-scale, practical applications in the wider world.  Here is one example.  This spring my university adopted a new energy storage system, a prototype smart grid, created in partnership with Alpha Technologies Ltd. and Corvus Energy.  It serves as a backup power grid for our Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Facility on Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 10 of 22   campus, and it fulfills a necessary requirement for allowing large communities to integrate clean-energy sources into their power grids.   It is necessary for universities to study complex scientific, sociological and political issues. It is also our responsibility to address these issues with new ideas, new knowledge and new solutions.  But our responsibility does not end there.  We must also invest our unique place on earth and distinct, self-contained community to convert ideas about sustainability into practical, transformational change that can be adopted widely to benefit the planet.   THE ENDURING IMPORTANCE OF PLACE   As I call for us to make more use of our universities as places, I don’t want to suggest that place has never before been an important part of universities.  Universities as communities, as physical gathering places, have for centuries been powerful catalysts of thought and of change.  I am a law professor, not a chemist; but my general understanding of catalysts matches very closely with my own experience of universities.  A catalyst, as I understand it, acts very much like a gathering place for different molecules, holding them together, facilitating their interaction Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 11 of 22   with and ultimately reaction to each other.  By creating a space for collisions, a catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction.  Universities as catalysts attract and combine people of vastly different aptitudes and interests, placing them in environments where they can react to one another—law professors and chemists, particle physicists and performance artists, climate scientists and classical scholars.  The collisions that take place, both intentional and fortuitous, create the conditions for unpredictable discovery.  Universities are among the only institutions on earth that are able to cultivate serendipity and innovation in this way and to this extent.  As valuable as the technologies are that allow us to communicate and collaborate over great distance, we must never let them blind us to the necessity and benefit of coming physically together as a diverse community.   People come to universities to be transformed, to be inspired, to learn how to think, to learn how to learn, and to learn how to work with one another.  For this, people need other people, and they need a place to gather with those people.   Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 12 of 22   Consider the case of Yahoo!, one of the most virtual of companies working completely in cyberspace.  Marissa Mayer, the CEO, has famously required all staff to physically come back into the office.  She concedes that many people may be more productive when they're alone, but she notes that they are more collaborative and innovative when they’re together.  She says, “Some of the best ideas come from pulling two different ideas together."  I prefer the idea of our universities attracting, rather than commanding people to gather together for the pulling together of ideas.  But to be effective gathering places, universities need to be magnets for talented and diverse people.  They need to be alive and lively, inside and out, day and night.  They need to be communities unto themselves, but also part of larger communities offering opportunities for engagement, debate, investigation and, yes, intimacy, as a part of life, not just as an education apart from life or in preparation for it.   THE ‘BRAND’: A UNIVERSITY’S DISTINCT SENSE OF PLACE  French philosopher Marc Augé speaks of lieux and non-lieux, places and non-places.  Non-lieux are spaces or places that are essentially Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 13 of 22   interchangeable, and they tend to render humans anonymous.  As examples of non-lieux, Augé identifies airports, motorways and supermarkets.  According to Augé, non-lieux is what luxury hotel chains have in common with refugee camps.   In an age of massive interconnectivity and free-flowing mobility, in the face of powerful forces of change, we have at hand potent tools whose use can easily tend to homogenize us, to turn all universities into one giant university, to blur distinctive places into non-lieux:  virtual nowheres.  This, I believe, is a great danger.  Non-lieux may be the product of change, but they do not and cannot create change.  When I come here, and when I visit other universities, I am always excited to taste the distinctiveness of that particular community.  What does it feel like?  Does it have a personality?  Specific points of view? This, to me, is its sense of place, and I experience it viscerally as well as intellectually.  Here in Chongqing I find a unique place that rewards my efforts to travel here.  Universities should always be worth travelling to.   We all need to assert our distinctiveness of place and with it our uniqueness of culture, perspective and expertise. Our differences, in Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 14 of 22   fact, enable us to be a part of a robust collaborative effort to change the world for the better.  We will be more effective if we are tackling issues and challenges from a variety of different angles and perspectives.   A SENSE OF PLACE IN CYBERSPACE  I’ll suggest that our distinctiveness, our ‘brands” should be experienced in our virtual presence as well as on our campuses.  We need to differentiate online just as vividly as we do on campus.  We each need a distinct sense of place in cyberspace.   We are challenged to ensure that how others experience us online is neither as a grab-bag of disparate stuff nor a homogenized generic product.  Our virtual presence, just like our physical one, needs distinguishing characteristics, distinctive points of view and personality, and that requires some intentional curation and self-reflection.   Our virtual presence should also serve to connect people to our unique physical place.  Among the millions of people who have taken online university courses, the vast majority express a clear preference for a Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 15 of 22   blended approach of virtual access and face-to-face meeting.  And so rather than replacing a classroom with a screen, our use of digital technology should seek to create virtual windows, telescopes, portals and listening posts linking people not only to other people, but also to increasingly vital physical places.   THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF PEOPLE AND IDEAS   If higher education is powerfully dependent upon people gathering in distinctive places, consider how powerful it is when people begin to travel amongst those places, encountering new worlds of people.   In the history of higher education, there has never been more ease of movement.  That movement is not only within the academy, it is also among the academy, government, industry and civil society.  It is across borders and across sectors. So too are the issues that face us.  They cross borders and cross sectors as well.  What we experience locally is almost always simultaneously global.   There is no easy way to become globally aware.  And so it behooves each of us as universities and as societies to educate our students to be Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 16 of 22   global citizens.  Each of our communities should send as many students as possible abroad to study, and each of our institutions should invite as many from abroad to study with us.  I am speaking here of physical travel, such as what has brought me here today (not just collaboration through telecommunications, though that is also an essential element.)    One example that I admire is the Beijing-Tianjin Water Resources Management Project, which involves a partnership among three Chinese and four Canadian Universities working towards a better quality of life through improved management of water resources.   Collaborative mobility such as this has benefits for the environment, for institutions, and for individuals.   It enables our students to acquire local knowledge and language, but also to experience the transformational quality of spending time in distinct and interesting places with exciting and inspiring people who are different from us.  This broadens each individual.  But there is more.   As we move from place to place our students, researchers and even we administrators have the opportunity to cultivate a generation of globally networked friends and colleagues who know each other, who Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 17 of 22   like to work together and who are comfortable on each other’s turf.  We are already seeing new businesses, new partnerships, new industries and initiatives arising from such lasting, international friendships.  We will see, and need to see, many more world-embracing connections in the next few years.  It feels appropriate to mention one example that is timely.  Professor Qiqi GAO, Director of the Political Science Institute of the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai has for the past six months been working and teaching at the University of British Columbia as a Visiting Associate Professor at our Institute of Asian Research.  His work is directed toward China’s participation in global governance and in Vancouver he has been working with Professor Yves Tiberghien, researching a project entitled “The Implications of Canada’s Deliberative Democracy Model on China’s Democratic Development”.     For his part Professor GAO has invited me to his university, and it is through his kind invitations that I will shortly travel to Shanghai to visit, for the first time, the East China University of Political Science and Law, and meet with President Qinhua He to explore new opportunities for collaboration between our institutions. Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 18 of 22    INTERCONNECTIVITY OF INSTITUTIONS  Just as global encounters provide opportunities for individuals, we have tremendous opportunities as institutions to join forces as networks of universities to share research, provide intercultural and international degree programs and, essentially, to open our institutions to the world.  From our different places, using our different tools, competing for the world’s best talent, we need to communicate more, and we need to collaborate more.   The Joint Centre for Translational Medical Research in Child Development and Alzheimer’s Disease is just such an example of collaboration.  It involves not only the sharing of research and expertise but also the physical exchange of faculty members and students between our institutions and, of course, the hands-on treatment of children in your hospital.   What I am suggesting is that our universities need to continue to change in many ways in order to remain relevant, viable, and meaningful places of change.  They need to include their physical Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 19 of 22   infrastructure in fulfilling their mandate to serve society.  They need to increase their distinctive sense of place both physically and virtually.  They need to encourage and facilitate greater exchange of students and faculty between places for greater collaboration.  And they need to do all of these things in order to address the world’s toughest problems.  PUTTING CHANGE IN ITS PLACE – PRESERVING OUR PRINCIPLES  But I am not suggesting indiscriminate change—change for change’s sake.  Even as we work very hard to effect change and to adapt to changing circumstances, we must also put change in its place.  In a folksy English colloquialism, we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.   No matter how thoroughly we change, we must ensure that our universities protect and preserve the qualities that have made us so valuable to human progress over the centuries.  First among these is the principle of freedom of inquiry.  Universities must remain places where people can ask the very toughest questions of society, from within society.  This is that aspect of apart from and a part of that no Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 20 of 22   other institution can replace.  If we don’t fulfill this function, then no one else can.   We must not give up our responsibility to protect and preserve knowledge, to communicate, test, prove, debate and analyze.   And as we continue to communicate faster and more freely across borders, we must also honour and preserve the university’s role of facilitating “the long now”: long and slow open-ended conversations across time, between the past and the present, and from the present into the future.  From their inception, universities have had an obligation to serve society, to create and preserve knowledge, and to teach.  As the world changes, we are challenged on the one hand to preserve and protect those qualities that make us unique among institutions.  On the other hand we must change thoroughly wherever the status quo interferes with our ability to serve fully.   When I say change, I do not simply mean that we must adapt.  I mean that we must act.   We are obligated by our age-old responsibilities to lead.  Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 21 of 22    Some 22 centuries ago, Archimedes of Syracuse is reported to have said (in Greek) “Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”   He was speaking about leverage.  My friends, it is time to apply leverage.  We need to move the earth.   This is our role; it has always been our role; it is the reason we exist.  And I firmly believe that we can succeed at moving the earth into a sustainable future.   Our interconnectedness, our commitment to sustainability, our global mobility.  These are our levers.    We have the tools for collaboration and communication.  We need now to lower further the barriers to cooperation.  We are blessed with the tools of mobility.  We need now to move further out of our comfort zones.  We bear the responsibility of a planet in peril.  We need now to direct the urgency we feel into the tools of action.    Our obligation to society today demands a greater commitment to the world as a place, a place worth caring for, a place worth perfecting and preserving.  Let us make full use of all of our tools, including and especially our own individual places on this earth, our university Leading Change From Where You Are Prof. Stephen J. Toope Page 22 of 22   campuses, our university communities.  Let us look inward to what sets us apart from other places and let us direct our unique resources outward as a part of the wider world, to effect meaningful change, to move the earth.   Thank you.  --30--  
1.0108012~The university of the 21st century : a catalyst for creativity and innovation~Gupta, Arvind~           The University of the 21st Century: a Catalyst for Creativity and Innovation Green College Lecture January 13, 2015 Draft – please check against delivery                Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 2 of 11  Thank you, Mark, for inviting me, and thank you all for being here this evening. I am delighted to see students, including Green College residents, faculty members from across the academy as well as community members who have made the trip to the campus to be here this evening.  This year marks the centennial of Graham house, and I imagine this type of gathering is what Cecil Green had in mind when he envisioned the college as a place to bring the community and the university closer together under the banner of “friendship and ideas”.    UBC is also preparing to mark the 100th anniversary of its first class this September. We will be celebrating all that has been achieved in the past 100 years and – most importantly – how our past is shaping our future. So, it’s fitting that the theme of this series of talks is, “Ideas of the University of the 21st Century”. We can’t talk about the evolution of the modern university without first acknowledging the forces of disruptive change that have marked the turn of the 21st century. The list includes globalization, environmental sustainability, economic stability, fast altering job markets, and technological advances, to name just a few. These forces are also shaping post-secondary education, especially as we are pressured to view higher education in increasingly narrow terms. Governments everywhere are looking at ever shorter-term “fixes” for youth employment such as through promoting skilled trades, the implication being that our universities are simply out of synch with the economy.  There is a positive side to these pressures. It is pushing our post-secondary institutions to continually innovate, adapt to new realities, and define our place in the changing landscape. But we must always remember to do this within the context of our core academic mission of learning and research, ensuring we take a long-term view instead of being reactive. Today I want to look specifically at our capacity and responsibility to ensure that our students and researchers continue to enhance every part of society – in building a more just world, in advancing human knowledge Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 3 of 11  whether in health, in social policy, in environmental sustainability or technology and in advancing economic prosperity through innovation. Let’s start by agreeing on the definition of innovation. To innovate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is to “bring in new methods (or) ideas.” Borrowing from the Canadian Academies description, innovation is giving creative people the resources to address immediate and long-term socio-economic challenges. Phrased as a sentence, that seems like a linear process: we nurture creativity; then we link to community; and, together, we reap the benefit. But, in keeping with this definition, I suggest that the process is considerably more interactive. The best post-secondary institutions certainly have an advanced capacity to cultivate creativity – in students, among researchers and in the larger community. But the richest environment for cultivating creativity may come in the interplay among students, faculty, industry and civil society. Specifically, I’d like to argue that creativity flows from a wealth of experiences, some of them from formal education, and some opportunistic. * So how can universities support creativity? In an interview in 1929, Albert Einstein said, “If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. I get most of my joy in life out of music.”1 Einstein told his friend, the Japanese violinist Shinichi Suzuki, “The theory of relativity occurred to me by intuition, and music is the driving force behind this intuition. My parents had me study the violin from the time I was 6. My new discovery is the result of musical perception.”2                                                  1 Albert Einstein, quoted in Alice Calaprice, and Trevor Lipscombe, Albert Einstein: A Biography (Greenwood Press, 2005), 5. Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 4 of 11  The point is that, whatever the specialty, a diversity of pursuits – a rich variety of inputs – is more likely to engender a creative output. From Leonardo da Vinci to Chris Hadfield, the polymaths have demonstrated, again and again, the benefits of a broad, interdisciplinary and ongoing education. * How can we leverage what we know about creativity to cultivate research excellence? If we accept that creativity flows from a wealth of experience, then we must ensure that researchers are immersed in diverse and stimulating environments. Great researchers are inspired by their students, by their surroundings, by the music they hear or play, by the issues that challenge their society. If we are to be innovative, if we are to leverage our research capacity to increase the productivity of our community and our country, we will do so by embracing the pressures of the outside world. So, if we are to cultivate research excellence and maximize our own capacity for innovation, we must do three things: 1. We must support the research enterprise at every level; 2. We must integrate it wherever possible with other elements of the academy; and 3. We must promote engagement – among our faculty, between faculty and students and between the academy and the community. One of the first commitments I made when I became President was to invest 100 million new dollars in the people who discover, develop and deploy knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                       2 Robert & Michele Root-Bernstein, "The Art & Craft of Science," Educational Leadership (February 2013), 16; Shinichi Suzuki, Nurtured by Love (1969), 90. Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 5 of 11  That’s critical because research excellence is our distinguishing feature and will position us to compete with the best in the world for talent and break-through discoveries. * If inspiring creativity is our best hope for the future, the modern research university must be a catalyst, a place that attracts and combines people of vastly different aptitudes and interests, placing them in environments where they can learn, be entertained and provoked by one another. It’s a nexus, a hub, a gathering place, where great questions from across the academy and from broader civil society are asked and addressed. There can be no simple first-year course in originality or imagination. Creativity is complicated. It arises from the interconnections within and beyond the academy.  Our best discoveries – our most transformative revelations – will come in the complex interplay among disciplines and among those who think and those who do.   That being the case, in order to nurture and leverage creativity, we must maximize the opportunity for students to enjoy a diversity of experience, in and out of the classroom, in and out of the lab, within and amongst different disciplines, across geographic boundaries – and in connection to community. * How can we most effectively deliver that innovative energy beyond the academy? And how do we tap into the needs, the demands and the creative energy of the wider community to inform and inspire our own work? It all starts with talent. Whether in the social sciences and humanities or in the physical and health sciences – innovation comes most frequently from the most highly qualified people.  Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 6 of 11  Yet, the Conference Board of Canada reports that, among our competitors in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Japan graduates fewer PhD students per capita than Canada.3 We educate half as many as the U.K. or Germany and about one-third of Switzerland. We’re especially conscious of this at UBC. British Columbia runs behind the national average in the number of PhDs we produce per capita. Then, compared to the U.S., Canadian firms, not-for-profits, and governments hire fewer PhD graduates and pay them less – which the Conference Board suggests as an explanation for why more Canadians don’t commit to doctoral programs. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: fewer PhDs; lower Canadian demand for PhDs; less innovation; fewer opportunities for students. Our civil society doesn’t appreciate to the same extent as others the potential advantage of highly qualified people. In the current situation, it appears that lack of familiarity is breeding disinterest – to everyone’s disadvantage.  The PhD conundrum is a symptom of a challenge we see across Canadian society. The first step is to understand our own role in addressing this. Have our post-secondary institutions done enough to ensure the success of our graduates? Are we adopting our educational paradigm to ensure it remains relevant for our students’ increasingly diverse career outcomes? In fact, students entering UBC across all disciplines tell us that gaining experiences through experiential learning opportunities is the single most important goal they hope to achieve at university4.  Let’s consider this more carefully, by considering fields where students are already gaining direct exposure beyond the academy prior to their post-graduation career. In Education, for example, we would never send a                                                  3 Conference Board of Canada, How Canada Performs. Retrieved October 9, 2014 from: http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/phd-graduates.aspx 4 New to UBC Vancouver Student Survey 2014 Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 7 of 11  new teacher into the classroom without first giving them a structured opportunity to test their knowledge and skills. We would not send a nurse, a doctor or a physiotherapist into the work world without hands-on experience. Integration in the fields of health and medicine is something that UBC does extensively: we have deep affiliations with 11 teaching hospitals and the BC Cancer Agency. This model – of experiential learning and two-way communication between the academy and the working world – has also found a foothold in other disciplines. Our Engineering co-op program, for example, is the largest in western Canada and one of its greatest outputs is success stories. First, from a student perspective, 90% of those who participate in a co-op placement wind up with a permanent job with their co-op employer. Students are clearly getting the experience they need – and they are proving it to prospective employers along the way. They also become the engine for innovation. Consider Radu Postole, a self-described “mediocre student” until his first co-op term with a German research firm called GKSS. Thanks to this experience, Postole said, “It suddenly dawned on me how all the academic learning is applicable in the real world.” Postole spent the rest of his study time on the Dean’s honour role. After working with UBC’s own Structured Surface Physics Lab on an alternative energy project called Solar Canopy, he leveraged his well-refined technical skills to get his first “real” job with a start-up company called SunCentral, helping advance the UBC solar lighting technology into a marketed product. Workplace experience, however, is just one form of experiential learning and does not preclude the importance of the experience of the academic environment in and of itself.  UBC and any of the world’s great research universities offer an opportunity to interact with some of the foremost researchers in the world. UBC’s research excellence gives our students immediate access to the latest discoveries and revelations. There is assuredly a place for research chairs and professorships, and we Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 8 of 11  must never deny our students the inspiration, enthusiasm and cutting-edge knowledge that they can only get from professors who are innovating at the very top of their field. UBC’s graduate students play an integral role in our research success. With over 250 graduate degree programs in nearly every academic field imaginable, UBC supports a thriving community of over 10,000 talented graduate students whose ideas, discoveries and innovations seek to advance our community and society. They are pursuing targeted research as well as what our Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Smith called “follow-your-nose” research.  Take Vanier scholar and UBC Psychology PhD student Michael Muthukrishna whose work with the Database of Religious History explores a big data approach to history that has the potential to offer an unprecedented breadth of knowledge amenable to the latest statistical and mathematical analysis.  This ambitious project aims to be the world’s first comprehensive, on-line quantitative encyclopedia of religious and social history. Michael and a team of historians around the world are seeking to expand our knowledge of the patterns of the past. While there may not be an immediate practical application to this emerging line of inquiry, it is exciting to think of the potential implications if we gain new understanding of how history shapes our future. Global research collaborations such as Michael’s and international student mobility foster academic, cultural, and social ties that can help to navigate an increasingly interconnected world. Multi-institutional, multi-national teams are best placed to obtain the advances needed to tackle the global challenges that are simply too vast for any single institution. UBC maintains a wide range of partnerships with universities around the world. One such network is the Max Planck-UBC Centre for Quantum Materials. The Centre links UBC’s leading quantum materials researchers to the top minds at Germany’s foremost basic research institution through joint research projects and student and faculty mobility programs. Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 9 of 11  The Centre also offers undergraduate students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in research projects in Max-Planck Institutes during a summer or co-op job. By exposing students early on in their education to research opportunities, we teach them to ask difficult questions about the world and challenge existing norms. We combine the full complement of the innovative energy of our faculty, graduate and undergraduate students. In other words, we fulfill our mission to be a catalyst for the bold and creative minds of tomorrow.  Experiential learning opportunities must tap into our strengths across the academy: from the historically and ethically informed critical thinking skills of the humanities, to the transformative capabilities of modern science. Universities must provide more opportunities for students to explore outside of their fields. If we leave it to them make all the connections themselves, than we are simply not doing a good enough job of marshaling the incredible resources at our disposal. Recognizing that the important questions of our day require the application of all types of knowledge, we must be actively exploring points of complementarity and synergy.  I’d like to briefly mention one multidisciplinary model for community integration. Mitacs is a national, not-for-profit that manages and funds research and training programs for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. I was the CEO and Scientific Director for the past 15 years. Mitacs is fundamentally an engagement mechanism, working with 60 universities, thousands of employers in the private and public sectors, and with every provincial jurisdiction in the country.  For example, the Mitacs Accelerate program facilitates research internships for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with industries across all disciplines. By building partnerships using all of the resources available to us, we would often find that scientific challenges could benefit from knowledge from the humanities, and vice versa.  One project I always found fascinating was working with a video game company on generating faster images. In video games, the faster you can get an image on the screen, the more realistic you can make things like driving games feel. We started with a technological challenge that quickly became a bigger conversation about Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 10 of 11  why some games are very popular and others whither on the shelf. We set up a project for a group of sociology and psychology PhD students to observe young people playing video games. Lo and behold they started learning all sorts of interesting things about the interplay between collaboration and competition in video games. And that lead to a series of popular non-violent games.   Mitacs also fosters international exchanges and undergraduate research experiences with the goal of creating a platform for novel student experiential learning. This is just one example of the kind of multi-disciplinary community engagement that must become even more commonplace. It is part of our commitment to build a plethora of research and educational engagement innovations in the years to come.  The pursuit of creativity, the support of interdisciplinarity and the goal of more effective and community integration will demand attention throughout the academy. Because there is no simplistic secret of success, no magic formula. Rather we must always keep in mind that: 1. Creativity flows from a wealth of experience and is best engendered with a broad, varied and lifelong education – of the heart as well as the head; 2. In order to nurture and leverage the creative energies of our students and faculty, we must maximize their opportunity to enjoy a diversity of experience, within the university and in constant and intimate connection to community. 3. Every individual – and organization – that joins in a close collaboration between the academy and the community is likely to reap enormous rewards. It is important to remember that universities do not, exclusively and narrowly, contribute to short-term economic goals. There is a great deal of good, in Canada and the world that cannot be expressed within the computations of Gross Domestic Product. Creativity, innovation and research excellence are certainly important to economic prosperity, but equally so to the quality of Canadian justice, to our personal health and social well-being and to our environmental health and sustainability. Canada begins with a huge advantage – Green College Lecture  Jan 13, 2015 Page 11 of 11  this vast, beautiful, rich country. We have built one of the most admired societies on the planet, with an education system that stands amongst the best in the world.  Our universities are already engaged in the issues that matter most to us. But the more we can immerse ourselves directly in society – the more we can bring the community even closer to the academy – the greater will be our chances for real innovation, that will benefit us all. It is by remaining true to this mission that we will make our greatest contribution in the 21st century. Thank you. 
1.0102632~I love you, you're perfect, now change : the new relationship between universities and the world they serve~Toope, Stephen J.~ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 1 of 12  Association of Commonwealth Universities—Centenary Conference Future Forward: Taking Charge of Change October 16-18, 2013 Senate House, University of London   I LOVE YOU, YOU’RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE The New Relationship Between Universities and the World They Serve    Colleagues, friends: It is a pleasure to be with you, and an honour to speak to you—but never more so than on this special occasion for the ACU. Always leave ‘em wanting more. That’s the hidden ethic of Broadway theatre, and it’s Broadway that provided the inspiration for the title of my presentation today. I have no doubt that whatever I have accomplished in my time with UBC, whatever any of us may accomplish as Vice-Chancellors, we will leave ‘em wanting more. And then our successors will be faced with the chorus we’ve all been listening to for several years now: I love you. You perfect. Now change.  I love you, you’re perfect, now change. Those three little phrases nobody wants to hear. Whether it’s government asking us to ‘tweak’ our research agenda to speed up commercialization; industry questioning our ability to meet the need for skilled workers; grantors placing geographical limits on eligibility for funding; or students wondering why our entire course calendar and library system aren’t online yet; we are getting it from all sides, in every relationship we’re a part of. We love you, we need you, you’re fabulous, now if you could just be … different.  ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 12  You’re not commercial enough; not “pure research” enough. Not practical enough; not academic enough. Not local enough or national enough. Not digital enough; not real-world enough. Not enough. Relationships! They’re enough to make a university president and vice-chancellor run for the self-help books. Or, more realistically, given our schedules, to an Internet Top 10 list.  I did, I Googled. I admit it. I did it for all of us. And you’re going to want to hear this:  Top 10 Advantages of Being in a Relationship – these include “higher self-esteem” and  “not having to dress up all the time,” both of which I would argue about in our case;  Top 10 Excuses You Make to Stay in a Bad Relationship – these include, “But it’s comfortable!”  And last but not least, Top 10 Relationship Killers – number one of which is “changing yourself to please—or to try to hang onto—your relationship partner.”   I could have called my presentation “Managing Change on Your Terms,” but I didn’t because I thought we could really use a more provocative perspective on the situation right about now … as well as a bit of a laugh. The laughs have been hard to come by lately, haven’t they? Ernst & Young’s “University of the Future” study last year quotes our colleagues in Australia saying, [1] “It’s going to be a tough decade.” [2] “Our major competitor in ten years’ time will be Google … if ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 12  we’re still alive!” And [3] “There will be 15 to 20 independent global brands … the rest will be playing for the silver medal.” The study’s working hypothesis, which I contend is valid not only in Australia but everywhere, is that the dominant university model—of a broad-based teaching and research institution supported by a large asset base and a large, predominantly in-house back office—will prove unviable in all but a few cases over the next 10 to 15 years. That is a very tiny time horizon for an institution that got its start in medieval times. Don’t get me wrong: we know how to survive, and we know how to evolve. We’ve proven that. But what we’re facing now is the need to transform ourselves to a greater degree and in a shorter span of time than we have ever accomplished before.  Management consulting firms are profiting nicely from the quiet panic prevailing in cloistered hallways all around the world. Each one offers its own version of the Top 10 list and then we scramble to tick every box. First, there’s the list of so-called “change drivers,” and you’re familiar with them all:  increased competition for students  increased competition for funding  decreasing government funding  increasing costs per student  proliferation of digital technologies  global mobility  increasing need to integrate with industry  the urgent need for skilled workers ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 12   advances in our understanding of how people learn  government and student demand for more outcomes-based measures of performance  global interconnectivity  developing countries’ exploding demand for higher education  and the catch-all: globalization I am sure to have missed a few; the list seems to grow every day.  And then there are the well-meaning—and, occasionally, the self-serving—recommendations as to how we should all proceed. “Maintain the status quo, but streamline,” is one. “Dominate a particular market niche,” is another. “Become a teaching-only institution,” is a third. “Merge with other sectors, such as media, innovation, and venture capitalism, to create something entirely new” is yet another. The common denominator, the phrase I hear in association with every recommendation, is the necessity for radical transformation. When I became aware that that’s what I was hearing, it hit me: We’re doing that thing. We’re doing that thing people do when someone says, It’s not you, it’s me. I love you, you’re perfect. But this is just not working.  We’re doing that thing: We’re changing … to please.  Hipper hairstyle. Sexier clothes. Wittier remarks. Brighter laugh. We’re tap dancing like crazy, only someone else is in control of the music, and we know ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 12  that no matter how fast or how fantastically well we dance, we still might not get a part in their show. We still might get dumped for our shinier, glossier rival.  Social media. The new matchmaker, pick-up bar, relationship display window and dumping ground all in one. Facebook, for example, offers 11 choices when it comes to declaring your relationship status. One of those 11 is “It’s complicated.” That’s us! That’s universities—with every single one of our stakeholders and constituents and partners. Complicated. “Sorry folks, it’s complicated, because, you see, we’ve got all these change drivers buffeting us about, and recommendations from all sides as to how to respond, and it’s just so enormously complicated!”   Except … it’s not. Perhaps it’s even simple—the problem and the solution. So much so that it’s been staring us in the face for, oh, about 800 years now. Let me be clear: We do need to change, we need to change a lot, and we need to change fast. The process will be difficult and even painful at times, and the ACU may look very different 10 years from now. I am told by change management experts that the majority of institutional efforts toward transformational change fail; 70 percent, in fact. But ‘difficult’ is not the same as ‘complicated.’ And ‘vital change’ is not the same as ‘radical transformation.’ ‘Radical’ means ‘root.’ It means changing in essence. And if we do that—and some of us are already making moves in that direction—we’ve lost. We may need to make drastic ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 12  alterations in order to carve out our place in this brave new century. But what will enable us to survive and thrive through the next 10 challenging years is holding fast to our medieval mission. How’s that for radical?  I thought about writing my own “Toope’s Top 10 Tips for Surviving the Make-or-Break Decade.” But you know what, it’s really hard to remember 10 things, and I wanted to give you something you’d remember. So I have just one: one change driver that you can use as a lens to look at all change drivers; and one criterion you can use to evaluate every next step.  The Change Driver The common denominator of every driver of change, from digitization to climate change to global mobility, is direct experience. Direct experience: either the desire for it or the absence of it. Universities arose out of an ecclesiastical culture that presumed a responsibility for mediating its followers’ experience of the sacred. That paternalistic dynamic stayed with us even after our transition to secular institutions, and has perpetuated that ‘ivory tower’ reputation among those we’re meant to educate and serve that persists to the present day. My bottom line: to the extent that we as institutions continue to mediate or even block direct experience, we will falter. To the extent that we are able to provide or increase access to it, we will succeed.  ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 12  Other sectors have led the way for us, demonstrating both what to do and what not to do. The music industry now has its iTunes, and the film and video industry, its Netflix. In both cases, the end user has access to all available content at any time and in any way she wants it. No more commercials. No more waiting a week for the next episode. No more LPs where someone else has decided which songs she’ll hear and in what order. The business model is both economical for the user and profitable for the owner. Music and screen artists are directly available to their fans via social media as well as all the traditional channels.  The publishing industry, on the other hand, is still figuring it out. eBooks, which were supposed to revolutionize the industry, have turned out to be nothing more than print analogues—ironically. They’re not a new business model because they’re not a user-driven way of accessing content. Meanwhile, the growing success and credibility of self- publishing both in print and online is mystifying the industry’s captains; don’t readers need Random House to tell them what’s worth reading? And so the mergers and closures and bankruptcies continue.  The proprietary, exclusionary control of content is obsolete. Every change, from the ones that are upon us to the ones we can’t see coming, is going to be driven by people’s desire for ever more direct experience. Every one of our failures will be borne out of our inability or our refusal to provide it or to get out of the way.  ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 12  It is a university’s job to lower barriers that limit or disallow direct experience. I’m talking about the invisible barriers between individuals of different backgrounds, cultures, and orientations on our campuses that Sir David King talked about; I’m talking about the borderlines we’ve drawn between our campuses and the communities we serve; the boundaries between disciplines, fields, and faculties, and those between our institutions that exist because of geographical distance or philosophical difference or market share competition.  I’m also talking about the barriers—from financial to political—that keep too many local students and scholars homebound and too many would-be international students and scholars locked out. We claim to be graduating global citizens, but how many of them have traveled? How many have had a transformative encounter with someone whose views and beliefs differed markedly from their own? How many, actually, have left our campuses after four years without ever having thought seriously about how their fields of study—whether music or mathematics or marine biology—relate to the fundamental challenges of our day?  Universities too often shy away from the social realities of deep diversity. We have arrived at this critical juncture in collective university history partly because of our fear of crossing those borders and boundaries and barriers I just described. We are afraid of the no-man’s-land of contested values. We seek to find consensus before we allow for the kind of spirited dialogue that sharpens ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 9 of 12  understanding. We prize comfort over robust and challenging debate. We Canadians are known for our tolerance, and we’re pretty good at it. But we’re not so good at principled, open-minded engagement with individuals and institutions and cultures whose values are not compatible with our own. A Canadian fault or a universal one? You decide.  I will say that universities’ failure so far to fully democratize access to direct experience—whether it be information or intercultural encounters—is based in fear. Our fear—of losing control. Of being irrevocably and detrimentally altered.  So what do we do? Is there one magic criterion by which every decision in the difficult decade to come may be safely gauged? I believe there is ….  Be yourself.  It’s the one thing all the relationship gurus and Top 10 lists agree on. In any event, everyone else is already taken.  Universities have a mission that is unique in all the world: to serve the world, through the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, and the creation of new knowledge. That is our task, and our task alone. We may need, now, to figure out new ways to do it, and as Sir David emphasized this morning, our graduates are facing a different world than the one we graduated into. But we do ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 10 of 12  not need to become something entirely new, or figure out something new to do. We do not need to fear having it taken away from us, but we should take a hard look at our own readiness to relinquish it, like a baby with bathwater. Our survival rests in holding to the unique and necessary role we carved out for ourselves 800 years ago. Our challenge lies in the fact that we are no longer optimally organized to fulfill it.  Up until now, we have managed to evolve alongside the rest of society, allowing everything from returning war veterans to the feminist revolution help shape the institutions we’ve become. Free-market capitalism, too—so that we have become better organized for competition than collaboration. Our collegial system of governance, largely a positive trait, can be a hindrance when it comes to responding to high-speed change such as we’re undergoing now. We’re nation-based, and our national systems do not fully support our need for mobility. And we are often preoccupied with superficial measures of reputation, short-sighted research funding, and commercialization over sustainability.  Why? It would be easy to blame a lack of money. But I don’t. I blame a lack of service. We have forgotten to serve. Or we have forgotten the value of the core service we provide.   Universities change the world! It’s what we all came here to do. It’s what Sir David challenged us to do. It’s what attracts our students, our staff, our faculty: ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 11 of 12  the direct experience of putting our unique gifts into service to the world. It should be our point of attraction for everyone we partner with. But are we providing clear pathways for that? Are we clear, ourselves, that that’s what we’re offering? The money is there. It’s part and parcel of the desire to serve. So we’re not making the ‘big ask;’ we’re making the big offer. The biggest: We change worlds. Join us!  Show—don’t tell, show—your political leaders of every stripe the economic long view, and your place in strengthening it. Offer your faculty members incentives for crossing barriers of discipline and geography. Reward your staff for the ways they contribute to sustainability, intercultural understanding, international engagement. Expand free access to course content. Add online components to your face-to-face classes, and vice versa. Ask your fellow university network members what you could do to increase engagement with them. Take a leadership role in creating an innovation hub in your city or region. Some of this stuff doesn’t even have to cost anything.  One final thought: It’s time to pull our focus away from rankings. University rankings are predicated on the assumption that we are all trying to be the same thing, which is to say, all things to all people. In this time of hyper-diversity and specialization, I can’t think of anything more likely to precipitate your institution’s demise. Universities exist to serve the world through the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, the creation of new knowledge, and lighting the fire ACU Stephen J. Toope Page 12 of 12  of inspiration in our graduates. The form that takes can and should be utterly unique to you.  UBC is a global leader in the study, teaching, and practice of sustainability, and we have turned our Vancouver campus into a living laboratory. Internationally, we have a long history of fruitful engagement in Asia, so much so that we are asked by government offices to provide introductions. Are we equally invested in Eastern European literature? No.  Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” Know yourself. Know your value. Let your barriers down and invite in the messiness of transformation. Change structurally if you must, but don’t change radically; keep your medieval roots. They’re what make us what we are. And the world needs us, more than ever before. Thank you.  -30-  
1.0102627~Learn, discover, contribute, disrupt  : the mission of the Global University~Toope, Stephen J.~CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 1 of 15  LEARN, DISCOVER, CONTRIBUTE, DISRUPT The Mission of the Global University Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia Canadian Bureau for International Education Conference November 20, 2013  “One of the great liabilities of life is that all too many people find themselves living amid a great period of social change, and yet they fail to develop the new attitudes, the new mental responses, that the new situation demands. They end up sleeping through a revolution.”  Good morning. It has been a pleasure to be here with you today, and it is an honour to have been asked to close the circle today. As I was preparing my remarks, what came first to my mind were those words from Martin Luther King Jr.—clergyman, activist, humanitarian, and peaceful revolutionary. Over the course of the past few days, you have come together to ask and to try to answer one question: How can the education we provide prepare Canadians to lead in a world that is changing faster than our conventional modes of understanding can grasp? Conferences. Classes. Books. Journals. All necessary; all at CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 15  least a step behind at all times. Even our newest technologies: obsolete by the time they reach our hands. What does leadership even look like in a world where most of us are scrambling just to follow?  It looks…like aha. [pause] It looks like insight. Like wonder. It looks more like magic than logic. More like spirals of ideas circling back to old questions at new levels of perception, than linear trains of thought en route to preset destinations. More like meditation or music than mission statements or manifestos. It is the difference—simple but absolute—between the moment one is asleep, and the next moment … awake.  We—Canada as a nation and as a collective of individuals—and we, the heads of the institutions called to provide leadership to both—are in danger of sleeping through a revolution we did not see coming and do not yet fully understand. Greater physical mobility than ever before, though perhaps less social mobility. Globalization of every marketplace, from resources to real estate to the three Rs of education. Massive proliferation of and access to digital technologies. Globalization of CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 15  communication and interconnectivity. And yet our failure as a species, in spite of this massive expansion and acceleration, to adequately address climate change, pandemic disease, or pervasive poverty.  It can be tough to know where to start, I know. To determine where the front lines of this revolution are, to prioritize resources, pursue international partnerships, maintain network connections, remain competitive, sustain rankings and reputation. How much more can universities take on before we’ve stretched our resources too thin? Before we’ve lost our effectiveness altogether? Where do we start? And where does it end?  One answer: in the classroom. On your university campus, in your home town, in this country.  A provocative statement, perhaps, at a conference on international education. But let’s take a closer look: The University of British Columbia is home to 50,000 students. Thirteen percent of our undergraduates, or CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 15  roughly 8,500 of them, hail from 149 countries outside Canada, and we plan to increase that quickly to roughly 17 per cent. Roughly a third of our graduate students are visa-holding. Our campuses are, in other words, visibly multicultural. So if you take just one idea away with you from this final session, may I suggest it be this: International education can begin at home, and if we are to continue to call ourselves leaders, it must.  The very best leadership is demonstrated by example. So until everyone in this nation enjoys a secure and respectful fluency of interaction with one another, including those people Canada has welcomed, invited, even solicited to live and study and work here; until we as universities have modeled that level of fluency to the degree that our students have learned and integrated it and enact it with one another, we are not leading. Period.  Universities have a calling that is unique in all the world: that is, to serve the world, through the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, the creation of new knowledge and the sharing of insight with new CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 15  generations. That is our task, and our task alone. In the face of the massive transformation our world is undergoing at this time, it is my contention today that there is a particular way we must now carry out this calling. It is the way of the peaceful revolutionary: to disrupt the status quo.  To disrupt: from the Latin, disrumpere, meaning “to break apart.” The way of the peaceful revolutionary: to break us open, to compel us to transform ourselves into the versions of ourselves that are capable of creating genuine change. Disruption: the birthplace of expansion, the beginning of compassion. Education: not the dispensing of polished wisdom into empty vessels but the complex and chaotic breaking apart of both ewer and vessel so that afterward, both are changed, mind and heart, and given new sensibilities and understanding that transcend every kind of border and boundary.    Like this: Four small groups of students sit in a classroom at UBC’s Institute of Asian Research. In each group, there is  an equal number of Japanese, CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 15  Chinese, and Korean students as well as students from other parts of the world. The three groups of Asian students have not interacted voluntarily before now, held on opposite sides of the room by decades-old conflicts in which none of them played any direct part.  Dr. Yves Tiberghien hands each group a textbook that he has brought back from Japan, and asks the Japanese students to read aloud a section of text, translating for their group. The Japanese students begin to read. The text concerns the Nanjing Massacre during the second Sino-Japanese War. Some historians claim that as many as 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers were murdered in the Massacre by the Imperial Japanese Army. Media around the world reported, however, that only one Japanese textbook ever mentioned the atrocities, and then only briefly and with doubts about the numbers of people affected.  When the students finish their translations, there is silence, and then the room explodes. The Chinese and Korean students are astonished that CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 15  this textbook contains clear information matching what they’d heard before, and they share the revelation with their groups. The Japanese students hear the others adding information to what they know and have just read, and begin to question what they’ve been taught. In the course of the discussion, they all come to understand that not every textbook has been as whitewashed as media have reported and that this one still doesn’t adequately address the level of barbarity. Together, they destroy the outworn myths and begin to construct a common narrative, something the leaders and historians of their countries have yet to do.   And here’s the epilogue: The following year, after spending the summer in China, a group of Chinese students return to Dr. Tiberghien’s class, high school textbooks in hand, and ask to do it again.  I am often asked why UBC pays so much attention to developing its international capabilities. Are we using international students to balance the budget?  I have grown weary of this question. CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 15   The short answer is that we need to provide our students the opportunity to work with others who are different from themselves. Why? Because massive disruption is happening at the societal level. The visible minority population in Canada has grown steadily over the last 25 years. These trends are much more pronounced in our cities, where 95 percent of the visible minority population resides. In 2011, visible minorities made up around 50 percent of the population in Vancouver and Toronto.  And in both cities, over 50 per cent of the population’s first language is neither English nor French. The diversity of Canada's population will continue to increase significantly during the next two decades. By 2031, visible minority groups are projected to comprise 63 percent of the population of Toronto, 59 percent in Vancouver and 31 percent in Montréal.  We need to hone our aptitudes as a society in order to function effectively in an interconnected world. We must equip our students with the intercultural understanding skills, the linguistic skills, the new attitudes and mental responses this new situation demands. We CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 9 of 15  otherwise risk an altogether unwelcome disruption: becoming a marginalized minority without the skills to effectively function in our own home country, let alone abroad.  It’s clear one doesn’t need to go far in this country to have an international experience. If you’re headed back to the airport later today, take the scenic route through Richmond, where the majority of residents are born outside of Canada. Follow Number Five Road, known as the “Highway to Heaven” and  you’ll find spectacular Buddhist and Sikh temples, mosques, a Chinese evangelical church, Vedic Cultural Centre and Tibetan Thrangu Monastery, all co-existing side-by-side, inviting worshippers and visitors of almost every culture and faith to experience the sacred within their walls.  This grand display of multiculturalism was short-listed as one of CBC’s Seven Great Wonders of Canada.  Acceptance of other cultures is a point of pride in Canada – it’s inextricably linked to our self-identity. But I wonder whether Canada—and Canadians—are really ready to take CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 10 of 15  leadership roles on the world stage? Are we even ready to deal with the challenges we face here at home? I observe a sense of complacency, almost a smugness about having gotten democracy and bilingualism and multiculturalism “right.” I perceive a comfort born of certainty that this is all there is; this is as good as it gets. In other words, I fear we are asleep.  If we were awake – truly awake – then surely we would be gripped by the dramatic irony that this nation that prides itself in embracing diversity is in the midst of a Truth and Reconciliation process with its First Nations people. The process is meant to address the losses and abuse suffered by those who were forced through Canada’s Residential School System as well as all of their family members who have been affected by that legacy. There isn’t an Aboriginal person in the country who hasn’t been touched by it in some way, and yet until now, there have been shamefully few non-Aboriginals who were even aware of it. That history was omitted from the formal education of all Canadians at all levels and we have only just begun to remediate that, and to create new narratives.  CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 11 of 15  Our textbooks were not better than the Japanese history textbooks that eliminated or downplayed the Nanjing massacre.  When any nation excludes any segment of the population from full participation, full citizenship, full expression, it denies itself its most precious resource: the full complement of strengths, gifts, perspectives and diversity that lives within all of its people. We cannot hope to lead in the international realm unless and until we are playing with our entire team.  When she was here in September for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission National Event in Vancouver, Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, Dr. Bernice King addressed the crowd, saying:  “There must be a persistent, consistent determination to see a new Canada where all people are respected and included in the culture, in the economic climate, in the forward moving process.”  CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 12 of 15  Shouldn’t it astonish us to have heard those words? We are Canadians, after all, the ones who have gotten multiculturalism right. It’s plain as day right there on Number Five Road in Richmond - the CBC told us so. Or have we really got it as right as we think we have?  When we consider the disconnect with our First Nations people, upon whose traditional lands we built our homes and universities - or with Quebec for that matter - are we really the nation of globalists we purport to be? Does the sharp division of urban and suburban areas into ethnically distinct neighborhoods suggest that we are a much more segregated society than we think we are? When we send our students abroad, are we doing all we can to ensure they are truly immersed in a different world rather than being able to merely recreate the familiarity of home? The international experience of too many of our students who choose to study abroad is limited to stays in the US or the UK or Australia and New Zealand.  And within our universities and colleges, are we truly creating multicultural learning environments where safe but disruptive interactions are encouraged and facilitated? CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 13 of 15   I cannot leave the subject of intercultural connectivity  without first addressing what I perceive to be Canada’s—and Canadians’—greatest challenge in that regard. Leo Tolstoy said, “Everybody thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing themselves.”    What needs disrupting most of all is US. We need to get it right at home. We cannot maintain the status quo and expect anyone to lead. If we haven’t yet done so, now is the time to disrupt our old way of looking at education. If we can’t create safe spaces for disruptive interaction now, what happens when the demographics shift even more radically?  As valuable as the technologies are that allow us to communicate and collaborate over great distance, we must never let them blind us to the necessity and benefit of coming physically together as a diverse community. People come to universities to be transformed, to be inspired, to learn how to think, to learn how to learn, and to learn how to CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 14 of 15  work with one another. For this, people need other people, and they need places to gather with those people – safe places like Yves Tiberghien’s classroom.   It’s not enough to ramp up the percentages of foreign students. We have to mix them up, create reactions, disruptive reactions. If we are seeking to define the mission of the global university, I submit to you that this is it.  Disruption can be a catalyst for change – the forward moving process. It can challenge old assumptions, spark dialogues, create action and expose new possibilities. Disruption can awaken us to new possibilities to the most difficult issues facing our global society – from the challenges of cultural diversity to the failure of fledgling democracies and the lack of civil society infrastructure in so many areas of the world.  We fear disruption, but these times in which we live demand that we do it.  CBIE Stephen J. Toope Page 15 of 15  It is the way of the peaceful revolutionary: to disrupt the status quo. To awaken.  I leave you with the words of Dr. Bernice King, who just a short distance from here told a large crowd of Canadians: “A revolution is underway. It is up to each one of you to continue the process.”  Thank you.        
1.0102625~The challenge for scientific and academic knowledge~Toope, Stephen J.~UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 1 of 8  Conference of the University-Based Institutes for Advanced Study: “The Challenge for Scientific and Academic Knowledge” September 19, 2013 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Thank you, Janis, for your kind introduction.  It is an honour to speak before such a diverse group of my peers. The University-Based Institutes of Advanced Study’s network spans the globe, and members work in nearly every discipline. Its mandate is equally broad: to spread knowledge globally. When I was first asked to speak today on “The Challenge for Scientific and Academic Knowledge,” I admit it felt just about as broad. What piqued my interest, though, was that the topic draws a (perhaps unintentional) distinction between scientific knowledge and academic knowledge. I decided that was where I needed to dive in.  UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 8  By way of putting this distinction in historical context, I’ll draw upon C.P. Snow’s concept of the two cultures of science and humanities. The thesis of his influential Rede lecture at Cambridge in 1959 and of his subsequent book published in the same year titled, The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures — namely the sciences and the humanities — and that this split was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems. To quote from the lecture: “So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.”  While Snow oversimplified and made polarizing declarations, he was right about the lack of scientific understanding among decision makers, a lack that persists today across the globe. Where he left off, however, and where I think universities have a special responsibility now, is with the limitations of scientific knowledge and thinking and the consequent need to be conversant in both cultures.  UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 8   Universities in general and Institutes of Advanced Study in particular deal with the whole sweep of knowledge, and must work to encourage the expression of all viewpoints on important questions. More pointedly, they must provide a meeting place for these viewpoints to learn from one another, as they are one of the only places where that can happen. While scientific knowledge is crucial, and the disciplined approach to thinking represented by science is very powerful, it is not the solution to the world’s problems in and of itself.  If we hope to fulfill our mission—of service to our communities, local and global—we must first teach our students—of every discipline—to see the value and strength in both cultures, and even in the ‘culture clash.’ I worry that universities are too often places where we shy away from the social realities of deep diversity, where we try to find consensus before we allow for the spirited dialogue that sharpens real understanding, where comfort is prized over robust and challenging debate about the future of our society and of our places within it. We scholars can be an UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 8  inward-looking lot, and we can pass that proclivity along to our students. Instead of generating robust debate, our disciplinary certainties can lead to dialogues of the deaf, or to mere ‘tolerance’ of diverse views without real engagement. If we are really going to bridge disciplines and open up new ways of addressing the fundamental challenges of our generation, we need to be more truly interested in diverse theoretical presuppositions, less inclined to prove others wrong or to simply condescend. We should be actively exploring points of complementarity and synergy.  We have to ask ourselves why so many of our undergraduate students are called upon to make all the connections themselves, do the integrating and synthesizing, bridge the artificial gaps? Why so many of our programs are so credit-intensive that students simply can’t take the opportunity to explore outside their fields? Why we replicate the same courses in various departments, rather than trying to find ways to share resources and create more diverse learning communities for our students? Why young professors with joint appointments fear they won’t UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 8  get tenure? Why ‘interdisciplinary’ programs and research centres are so often disconnected from undergraduate teaching? Why such programs and centres often have trouble finding space within faculties?   We are simply not doing a good enough job of marshaling the incredible resources at our disposal; we are not making the difference in society that we could. And in this failure we are providing de facto support for the prevailing political and media discourse that values science over the humanities; that says societal progress and prosperity are based solely on advancements in science and technology, rather than on constant dialogue between Snow’s “two cultures.”  But let me flip that coin for a moment. The conclusions of science are frequently either ignored or attacked by politicians, the media, and the public. Climate change is one obvious example. Another is our dependence on the efficient (or rational) market hypothesis in economics. The inability of its precise formulas to account for some aspects of human behavior contributed to the financial crisis of 2008. A UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 8  third is the controversy surrounding vaccinations of children. The scientific approach to quantifying and communicating risk is clearly ineffective here.  So what’s going on? Could it be that people innately know the information they’re getting isn’t balanced? And what is the role of universities in general, and institutes of advanced study in particular, in bringing scientific and humanistic knowledge back into balance?  I am a law professor, not a chemist; but in the spirit of being conversant in both cultures I will put on my science “cap” and use my limited understanding of catalysts to describe my own experience of universities.  A catalyst, as I understand it, acts very much like a gathering place for different molecules, holding them together, facilitating their interaction with and ultimately reaction to each other. By creating a space for collisions, a catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction.  UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 8  Universities attract and combine people of vastly different aptitudes and interests, placing them in environments where they can react with one another—law professors and chemists, particle physicists and performance artists, climate scientists and classical scholars. The collisions that take place, both deliberate and accidental, create the conditions for unpredictable discovery. Universities are among the only institutions on earth that are able to cultivate serendipity and innovation in this way to a significant extent.  Universities are also the only places where pursuit of knowledge in and of itself is considered a good thing, where the primary motivation is to carry out the best scholarship possible, and where many different types of research co-exist. Institutes of Advanced Study embody these ideals at the highest possible level of achievement.  Universities are now able to connect people across countries and cultures, and we are in the business of sharing knowledge freely. Universities are the one place where quite often the question is more important than the answer, and the journey of discovery is as important as the outcome.  UBIAS Conference Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 8   Solutions to (or even just a clearer understanding of) the most pressing issues of our day require the application of all types of knowledge, a dialogue across academic cultures. Institutes of Advanced Study provide a venue and support for this type of work, and are among the most important contributions a university can make. To meet our potential, though, we at universities need to work harder to cross borders and foster connections. And to do that, I suspect we will have to confront our fear of controversy and robust debate. Perhaps we’ll even start today. If universities fully claim the terrain as sites for the rich contestation of values, we might just become the deeply influential social institutions we aspire to be. Social, scientific, innate, or learned: whatever knowledge we possess, that is the challenge we face now.  Thank you.  -30- 
1.0102629~Imagine 2013~Toope, Stephen J.~IMAGINE 2013 September 3, 2013 Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Hi.   It’s so great to meet you.  This moment is unique for me. Every September, I stand on this stage and speak to UBC’s newest students, imagining as I do what we will create together over the next four or more years, how UBC will change, how you and I will change, and knowing as I speak that we will all come together again, one final time, for your graduation.  But this year is different. This year, your first at UBC, is my last. So this moment is particularly poignant for me. This is the only moment in time that all of us will share. And I’m going to ask for your help with something: Help me make this moment count.    Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 2 It’s become a cliché, hasn’t it, “making the moment count,” because we want to believe we’re going to do it, but we’re pretty sure we won’t. Between TV, computer gaming, and Google searching alone, we’ll waste countless moments throughout our lives. We’re pretty good at making the most of the “big moments” when they come along—first day of university, the big game, the big exam, the big date, graduation—but we so easily lose sight of how precious the small ones are. I want to use this moment we have together to give you a way to remember.  So … are you ready? ARE YOU READY?  My senior advisor warned me not to use the Latin, not on the first day. But I’ve got the outfit and I’ve got the microphone and I’m going to use the Latin. I told him I think you can handle the Latin. Can you handle the Latin? CAN YOU HANDLE THE LATIN?  [silence]    Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 3  Memento mori. [pause] “Remember that you will die.”  That’s it. [pause] That’s my secret. And believe me when I say that the older you get, the easier it is to remember! But this idea is making its way into the collective consciousness of every generation. I’ve seen a Lululemon bag, of all things, that says, “Visualize your eventual demise. It can have an amazing effect on how you live in this moment.”   And that’s the point, of course: not just to remember you’re going to die, but to remember to live! Fully. Completely. Authentically. In other words, yes, if you fulfill all your course requirements, you’ll graduate. But what do you want the years and months and moments between now and then to feel like? What new version of yourself do you want to be when you get there?  Who here knows what a bucket list is? [hands; pause] Okay, and who here has a bucket list? [reaction] A bucket list is a list of the all   Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 4 things you want to do before you kick the bucket. For example: “I must remember to add skydiving to my bucket list.” Having a bucket list helps you carpe diem. That’s Latin for “seize the day.” The bucket list keeps you focused on what’s most important to you.  I have two bucket lists. I know, I know … you’re thinking, “Of course he has bucket lists. He’s old.”  It’s true. I’m one of the lucky ones. Not everybody gets to get old. Think about that. So I have two lists: one for my final year at UBC that includes making sure UBC is a leader in flexible learning, as well as finally taking that walk on Wreck Beach. [pause] Fully dressed. [pause] In winter. I have a second list for the life I envision for myself after I leave UBC, and that one includes making a new contribution in the field of international human rights law, where my heart lies.  One for UBC; one for after UBC. The items on your list don’t have to be huge. In fact, sometimes minima maxima sunt. Latin: the smallest things are the most important.     Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 5 The only requirement is that the author be you—not your friends, not your family, not your professors. Your lists won’t look like anyone else’s. And that’s the way it should be.   Don’t put off writing them. Tempis fugit. Latin again, for “time flies.” These years at UBC may be the most political, heightened, charged time of your life. There is a special energy belonging only to this time that will accelerate you through an almost vertical learning curve, dismantle most if not all of your old belief systems, and transform you radically, forging you into a more awake, more aware, more capable version of yourself. Your relationships will change and some will end. You will travel, perhaps across the globe, perhaps to deeper levels of your own consciousness. Your vocabulary will change. You will speak new languages. You will invent, create, perform, compete, collaborate, discover, and contribute of yourself in ways you cannot even imagine in this moment. But what you can do right now is say yes. Invite it all in. Though there will be days when it doesn’t seem so, this time is   Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 6 short, and it will never come again. The university is the universe made tangible for a brief and wondrous time in your lives.    And UBC will be changed during your time here. Today’s theme is “I am UBC.” I am UBC. You are UBC.  The thing is, I’m not UBC. And you are not UBC. [pause] It’s the other way around: UBC is us. We call UBC a place of mind but it is more mind than place, and this mind is the collective vision we bring to our time here together. We don’t just experience it; we create it. And in the process, we create the next version, the next evolution of UBC. UBC will be what we become while we are here.  And the very best thing about it? Tu um est. Yep, Latin. It’s UBC’s motto, and it means, “It’s yours.” It also means, “It’s up to you.” This place, these people you’re traveling with, these years, this time in which you live … it’s yours, and what you make of it, and of yourself, is up to you.    Imagine 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 7 Memento mori. Tempis fugit, carpe diem, minima maxima sunt.  Remember that your time here is short, and make every moment count. Time flies, so seize the day—not tomorrow but this day—and do what you came here to do. Don’t judge the inspirations as they come; sometimes the smallest-seeming things lead to the greatest learnings, the biggest discoveries, the highest contributions. These years at UBC are yours; this life is yours. Tu um est.  Welcome to UBC.  -30- 
1.0108016~Student Leadership Conference~Gupta, Arvind~Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 Good morning! Are we all awake on this early Saturday morning? Great. Well, just to be sure and to get us all thinking about today’s theme of taking the next step, let me begin by describing a scene from the future:   A young man, about your age, slips on his “smart clothing”, an automatic-drying jacket and powerlacing shoes, and jumps on his hoverboard. Whizzing along a busy intersection,  1 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 he narrowly dodges flying cars, heading at break neck speed along skyways to cities on faraway continents. The year is 2015, and the young man’s name is Marty McFly.  You may recognize this as a scene from Back to the Future II, a movie released in 1985, before many of you were even born. While this played in the background at my house over the holidays, it occurred to me that Steven Spielberg and his team got some things right when they envisioned our world today. But,  2 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 understandably, they also had some misses. Our world is changing so rapidly that it’s difficult to foresee where we will be in five years, let alone in 30.  The same is true of the workplace. In a study called The Future of Work1, professional services network PwC reported that a massive generational change is underway and, by 2020, Millennials will form 50 per cent of the global workforce. As this unfolds, they predict 1 The Future of Work: A Journey to 2022, PwC, 2014. Retrieved December 2014 from: http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-work/assets/pdf/future-of-work-report-v23.pdf  3                                                           Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 traditional career models may soon be a thing of the past and many of the roles and job titles of tomorrow will be ones we’ve not even thought of yet. I would argue that this points to the opportunities that lie ahead for aspiring leaders who are open to new ways of doing things, are inherently inquisitive and willing to take calculated risks in pursuit of their ambitions. Although I am not convinced that I have yet earned the credentials to offer extensive advice  4 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 on leadership, I would like to briefly focus on three traits that I believe will help you in taking your next step, no matter how ambiguous the future may be. The first trait is flexibility. The jobs of tomorrow are unknown and even unknowable from our current perspective, but the ability to consider information critically, to assimilate facts into bigger narratives, and to generate new ideas never goes out of style. Aspiring leaders must  5 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 have the ability to think systematically, to welcome change, to disrupt and to innovate.  This is the gift of a great education – one that goes beyond knowledge in a particular field, or training in a specific skill. And this is precisely the new breed that will be in high demand as organizations face the task of perpetually reinventing their products and services in the wake of increasingly rapid innovation, changing business models and the escalation of social networking.  6 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 This brings me to the second trait that will be required of tomorrow’s leaders: passion. You may have a clear path in mind for your education and your career, but I urge you nevertheless to make your next step to explore what you are passionate about. For example, I hope, whatever you have signed up to study, that you will cast around and try new things. At some point, you will want to settle on something meaningful – perhaps something that will prepare you directly for your first job.  7 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 But remember: the voyage is important. Try some things outside your comfort zone and don’t worry that you might fail. That is as much a part of learning as is success. So it is crucial that you stretch yourself. The third trait is guts. In other words, your ability to defy convention to contribute positively to the world. Take UBC alumnus Brian Wong, founder of Kiip (pronounced keep), a mobile app rewards network. Brian noticed that the old school principals of  8 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 advertising were not working for mobile technology users and created a new philosophy of real world rewards for virtual achievements. Kiip has become an incredible success story with brands like Sony, Disney and Amazon on board. Brian credits his education at UBC and immersing himself in the high tech environment of the Silicon Valley with helping him develop this bold new way of thinking.   So, flexibility, passion and guts. Work on  9 Student Leadership Conference January 10, 2015 building these traits through your education and a broad variety of life experiences and you will be ready for that next step no matter what the future holds. Thank you.   10 
1.0102623~Expressions of reconciliation~Toope, Stephen J.~TRC Expressions of Reconciliation Stephen J. Toope, Page 1 of 4  EXPRESSIONS OF RECONCILIATION Reconciliation Week Vancouver September 18, 2013 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia   Good afternoon.  For the privilege of delivering this message to you today, I offer my gratitude to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; to each individual involved in organizing the events here in Vancouver; to Chief Bobby Joseph; to our hosts, the people of the Coast Salish territories; and to the Musqueam and Okanagan peoples on whose traditional lands UBC sits. It is an honour to be with you all.  We still call them schools. The “Indian Residential Schools.” As head of the largest school in British Columbia, I am aware that to use that same word—school—to refer to both those institutions and my own makes me distinctly uncomfortable. My first instinct is to want to distance UBC and in fact all the educational institutions of today from the residential schools, to draw a line between us, or to call the    residential schools something else, to redefine ‘school’ … anything, so that I can say, We are not what they were.  But the truth is that if there is a line between us, that line does not divide us; it connects us. There is what the residential school system did; and then there is what British Columbia’s school system failed to do, by keeping silent, for years, about what happened. There has been a critical gap in the education of British Columbians, an absence of information and, as a result, an absence of awareness and an absence of restorative action.  We have begun at last to break that silence. At every level, our school system is beginning to teach Canada’s residential school history as well as the resulting issues that affect Aboriginal peoples still, generations later.  Post-secondary institutions must play the particular role of furthering a deeper understanding through research and an advanced level of intercultural discourse. Through ongoing education, Canadians must come to a shared understanding of the circumstances that have    shaped Aboriginal experience so that we may all begin to know and to value one another.  UBC’s own preparations for this week began in earnest over two years ago, and our commitment has grown in the time since. Today, classes are suspended so that students, staff, and faculty may attend these events and I am pleased to see many from the UBC community here today. Teaching faculty have been encouraged to make these issues part of the conversation in their classrooms, no matter what subject they teach.  And finally, we have begun to raise money to build a UBC Centre for the Study of Indian Residential Schools. If we are successful, the Centre will occupy a place in the physical heart of our Vancouver campus, very near the main library, the locus of memory and record-keeping. Thousands will see it every day, and for students, researchers, and visitors alike, it will be a destination place. It will be a point of access to records and a repository for new recollections of survivors. It will also support the development of educational    materials, physical and digital, for use in universities, the K-12 school system, public venues, and communities.  On behalf of the University of British Columbia, I leave with you this photograph of the dedication of a new Musqueam welcome figure at our new law school building as a symbol of our commitment to reconciliation.  Thank you.  -30- 
1.0108010~Address by UBC president Arvind Gupta to Kelowna Chamber of Commerce, Coast Capri Hotel, November 14, 2014~Gupta, Arvind~Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  1 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta     Address by UBC President Arvind Gupta To Kelowna Chamber of Commerce Coast Capri Hotel November 14, 2014     Please check against delivery      Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  2 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta Thank you Deborah (Buszard) and thank you everyone. It’s always great to be here in Kelowna; in fact, my goal is to be here so often that everyone stops thinking of me as a visitor. At the same time, it’s also heartening to know that our Okanagan campus is in good hands under Deborah’s leadership. I am, as I said, delighted to be here today, in Kelowna and with the Chamber of Commerce. And I’m honoured that so many of you have chosen to join me for this occasion. I’d like to do three things in my presentation today. As a first order of business – and an overarching theme – I want to speak to the synergistic relationship that exists between great universities and great cities. I especially want to address the excellent relationship that exists between UBC and the great city of Kelowna. Second, as a still-new President and Vice-Chancellor, I’d like to talk about the opportunities for UBC in the next five to 10 years. I will identify five areas through which we hope to improve what is already one of the top two dozen public research universities in the world. Third, I want to talk about innovation, which I know is a topic of interest in the Kelowna business community. UBC is rolling out a new innovation strategy – designed to ensure that our own programs and activities are as innovative as they need to be, while maximizing our capacity to support innovation in the wider community. Let’s begin with what I think is one of the most important points of the day – the strength and potential of the relationship between UBC and the Okanagan. Great cities and great universities exist in symbiosis, feeding, inspiring, and energizing one another. Today, every city counted amongst the world’s “most liveable” boasts a world-class university. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  3 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta The urban theorist Richard Florida explained this in his 2004 book, The Rise of the Creative Class. Researching places like Austin and Boston, Florida documented how town and gown work in synergy, enhancing the social and cultural components that underpin a knowledge economy. He also tracked the remarkable results, from Stanford and Silicon Valley to the university cluster around Research Triangle Park in North Carolina.  His most profound conclusion was this: Industries used to choose locations based on access to physical resources – or tax breaks. Today, they move in search of knowledge workers – intellectuals and artists. On that basis, you might expect that I am here today to tell you all about UBC’s role in making Kelowna a great city – and I am. I’m incredibly proud of the contribution we have made, especially in the nine short years since founding our Okanagan campus. Even more, however, I want to impress upon you the importance of this region and this city in making UBC a great university. Our relationship is entirely reciprocal. Everything we do to help you, helps us in turn. And everything that you do, as businesses, as community members – as the demanding parents of worthy students – helps to make us better. Consider our Okanagan campus as it stands today. With 8,200 students, we have doubled the number of university spaces and added immeasurably to the graduate-level offering for Masters and PhD students. We have invested $400 million to double the size of our land base and to triple the square-footage of our built infrastructure. We have also tripled annual research budget, from $6 million to $18 million, and I can promise that’s a number that will continue to rise quickly. Our total annual economic impact in the valley is already $1.4 billion.  Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  4 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta We have introduced professional schools, such as Engineering, Management and – critically for the whole province – Medicine. And our Health and Social Development program is proving to be one of the most impressive academic start-ups in the country. I know I speak on behalf of our entire UBC team in Vancouver and Kelowna is saying that together, we are determined to ensure that this community has what it wants and needs from our university. I’m especially excited that UBC Okanagan students voted last month to fund one-third of a proposed 45,000 square-foot library expansion. This project has the potential to double the dynamic, technologically enhanced learning environment in the current library.  I would like to recognize Rocky Kim, President of our local student society who is here today and congratulate our students on their successful campaign.   As I contemplate how we’ve grown, I can’t help but to reflect that at every point in our development, we have been embraced by the people and businesses of Kelowna and the Okanagan Valley. I have often commented in Vancouver that the people in that great city could learn some important lessons from the level of community engagement between UBC and the people in this room. So, before I go any further, I want to thank you for the interest, the engagement and the support that you have already shown. You have played a critical role in UBC’s success to date and we appreciate it enormously. I also want to take this opportunity to say to you directly that I am personally committed to being a very active and present partner with you to the point that – as I said at the start - it won’t be news anymore that the President of UBC is in town.  Going forward this will be the normal course which I am very much looking forward to - and so is my wife Michelle.  We have been warmly welcomed by all we have met so far and we are eager to give back. Our goal now – and again this is a goal I hope that we pursue together – is to take what is Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  5 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta already regarded as one of the world’s top 25 public institutions and push it into the top 10. This is what we in the Improbabilities Business call an “aspirational goal.” And while I have set the target, I haven’t yet been bold enough to commit to a deadline. But I am deadly serious about this objective, because, in hotly competitive environments, you can never stand still. Among the world’s best universities, if you’re not moving up in the rankings, you’ll quickly find yourself sliding down. For me, the only acceptable direction to go is up. UBC Okanagan is critical in any push to improve. I have no doubt that this campus – and this community – have benefited by the prestige associated with being a University of British Columbia. For example, our international reputation has helped us attract some incredible talent to Kelowna and surrounding communities. UBC Okanagan is also a national and international destination for top-quality students. Okanagan residents still comprise the largest part of our student cohort – 28%. But another 25% come from Metro Vancouver, 20% from the rest of Canada and 11% from the rest of the world. They and the 1,061 local faculty and staff will be as important as every other UBC student, staff or faculty member in lifting this institution into the top 10.  The question, for me as President and, I hope, for you as community partners, is how do we get there – how do we get better? I believe that we must work in five critical areas. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  6 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta First and foremost, UBC is a Place of Learning. Our primary responsibility is to our students – to your sons and daughters, your future employees and shareholders. Increasingly, the “student” category includes all of us. A knowledge economy requires a well-educated populace and a lifetime of learning; a challenge to which UBC must respond. Second, UBC is a Place of Engagement. The question for me is never: what UBC can do for you; or what you can do for UBC? It is always: what can we do together? Third, UBC is an International Place. We are positioned globally. We compete globally. And for the people of Kelowna, B.C. and Canada, we are a nexus – a gateway to the whole social, economic and, we hope, sustainable world. Fourth, UBC is a Place of Innovation, in the way we operate, educate, and participate in the community and the economy. And Fifth, UBC is a Place of Research. That is fundamental, because excellent research is a distinguishing characteristic. Research excellence makes our reputation. It puts our students at the cutting edge of knowledge, giving them access to the latest discoveries and revelations. It allows us to nurture the leaders you need and to answer the questions you bring us. Research excellence is one of the central reasons that a great and innovative city needs a great university – we keep one another at the forefront. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  7 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta These themes are interwoven and I could easily look at UBC through any of the five. For today, however, I would like to concentrate on innovation. UBC is currently developing an innovation strategy, which will have five parts: 1. Build strategic partnerships; 2. Improve community access; 3. Increase the employability of our students; 4. Support the innovation ecosystem in our communities; and 5. Build UBC’s internal innovation support structure. Let me touch briefly on each. First, Building Strategic Partnerships highlights our determination to be pro-active in our engagement. UBC has always listened to our partners, integrating their needs into our academic mission. We plan to take that up a level. We want to be so connected that we aren’t waiting for partners to call us; we are looking ahead, together, anticipating the next challenge. Consider as an example the STAR initiative, in which the federal Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, Michelle Rempel, recently announced a $3.8 million investment. STAR is an acronym for Survive and Thrive Applied Research. Based here, the initiative connects UBC and other world-class research partners with industries that need the expertise and equipment that we can provide. STAR researchers are concentrating on interdisciplinary research in everything from human physiology, mental health and social work to manufacturing processes, product prototyping and marketing. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  8 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta One of the first STAR projects is led by Professor Paul van Donkelaar here in the Okanagan working with Professor Peter Cripton from UBC Vancouver in a collaboration involving UBC, Helios Global Technologies, and Imperial College London (UK), working together on a high-tech helmet that will reduce the risk of concussion in sports such as hockey and football. It’s part of the mandate to help individuals – and industries – survive and thrive. Our second innovation strategy is Improving Community Access. We want to be so enmeshed in community – connected by so many strands – that people and ideas flow freely in every direction. We want to be perfectly positioned to understand and adapt to what is happening in industry and society. That means augmenting existing infrastructure, such as the UBC Corporate Relations Office and the University-Industry Liaison Office. One such addition, unique to UBC Okanagan, is the recently-established partnership with the BC Ministry of Technology, Innovation and Citizen’s Services, which is placing one of its own, Janice Larson, on the UBC Okanagan campus. Janice will help coordinate government programs and promote innovation. And UBC will fulfil a double role: improving community access to our own services; while facilitating the connection between the community and the government of British Columbia. When I talk about access, I also mean literal, physical access, which is already much improved thanks to expanded BC Transit service to key destinations including West Kelowna, Okanagan College and Kelowna General Hospital. Physical access will get better still with the extension of John Hindle Drive, connecting Glenmore Road to the western part of the campus and improving cycling safety.  Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  9 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta Access can also be a factor of proximity. Consider, that 1,000 students already live in Quail Ridge north of campus. And major new private-sector residential developments south of campus will soon offer convenient housing to students, staff and faculty and a new opportunity for others to locate closer to the services, entertainments and cultural offerings that are inherent in any great university. This suggests more than the creation of a vibrant new Kelowna neighbourhood; it’s a further example of UBC and the city of Kelowna drawing closer to one another, again for mutual benefit. Access also speaks to our ability to accommodate all prospective students. For example, this campus has distinguished itself provincially and, I suspect nationally, by making space and providing the support necessary to ensure the success of aboriginal students. Thanks to programs such as Aboriginal Access Studies, the number of undergraduate and graduate students who self-identify as aboriginal has gone from 58 in the 2005-2006 academic year to 333 this year; that’s an increase of 474 per cent. Those numbers on their own answer the access question. For a further comment on “success,” I’d point out that 26 of these students working on Masters or PhDs. I am looking forward to meeting with and listening to local First Nations representatives in the coming months to learn more about how we can strengthen our partnership in other areas.  One of those I want to focus on is improving access to health care services through our UBC Centre for Excellence in Indigenous Health and collaboration with British Columbia’s new First Nation’s Health Authority.     The third innovation strategy is Increasing Employability – and here again I want to emphasize lifelong employability. The university constituency is no longer limited to 18- to 22-year-old undergraduates or even 22- to 30-year-old Masters and PhD students. In a knowledge economy, everyone must be a lifelong learner. How can UBC extend its reach? UBC Okanagan was itself an answer to that question. But we must go further. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  10 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta  Technology can play a critical role. In addition to enhancing the classroom experience, technology can bring UBC into the homes of mature students who are juggling the demands of careers and family or those who live a long way from our campuses. For example, our new Flexible Learning Initiative will leverage mobile technologies and internet connectivity to make 98 UBC courses available to an additional 30,000 students over the next three years. For employability, we are also committed to providing our traditional cohort with career-building opportunities that strengthen their academic and employment outcomes. Here we look to all of you as partners. The strategies we have in mind include: • increasing student exposure and training with industry advisors; • expanding experiential learning; • boosting internships, practica, and research placements; • further embedding professional development into curriculum; and • enhancing international mobility opportunities.  One of the great mechanisms for creating experiential opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students is called Mitacs, the organization I ran for the past 15 years. Mitacs is fundamentally an engagement mechanism, working with 60 universities, thousands of employers in the private and public sectors, and with every provincial jurisdiction in the country.  Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  11 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta For example, the Mitacs Accelerate program connects graduate student interns from all disciplines with partners in industry and civil society – to address pressing social or technical problems. In Kelowna, that has included an intern working with the health food leader Natural Factors to reduce waste and hazardous materials in the development of nutraceuticals. Another intern studied sustainable winemaking practices in the winemaking through a partnership with Quails Gate Winery.  Helios Global Technologies, which I already mentioned in the context of the new STAR investment, is also a Mitacs partner. These internships pay incredible dividends to students, as well as industry: • Mitacs interns have been placed into 2,500 jobs, 900 of which were brand new positions; • a decade out, Mitacs graduates are earning an average of $10,000 a year more than their graduate-level colleagues; and • 14% per cent of Mitacs interns start their own company – twice the usual rate for graduate students. As for industry impact: • 97% of Mitacs’ partners said the Accelerate experience made them even more interested in collaborating with academic researchers;  • while 74% said they now intend to increase investment in R&D. So, we’re excited that Mitacs has opened an office at UBCO with a new director, Jennifer Tedman-Jones, on the ground to promote university-industry collaborations. Mitacs is part of our fourth strategy, Supporting the Innovation Ecosystem. This is part of our commitment to link research to community – to ensure that cutting edge ideas coming out of UBC flow seamlessly into partner organizations, especially those that may not have in-house R&D capabilities. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  12 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta Consider Professor Anoush Poursartip at UBC Vancouver who led the establishment of the western-Canadian Composite Research Network that includes Professor Abbas Milani at the Composites and Optimization Lab here at UBCO. Together, they are working with Kelowna-based Flightcraft on the feasibility of finding an aircraft application for Armourgel – the same material that goes into the STAR/Helios safe helmets. These are projects that are only possible because of the depth of talent we can call upon across the whole UBC family. And there will be more where that came from: In my Installation address, I committed UBC to investing an additional $100 million to expand our total research capacity. This will be a transformative investment in the people who lead B.C.’s innovation agenda. It will multiply our research impact many times over. The final strategy is to Build UBC’s Internal Support Structures for Innovation.  We will begin by improving our own entrepreneurial potential. Entrepreneurship implies an appetite for risk – and innovation – in whatever you do, from starting a new business to designing a new outpatient service. On this front, you might look to the UBC Okanagan Faculty of Management, which is about to re-launch its Master of Management program, now designed to maximize the learning experience for enterprising, imaginative and adaptive managers in organizations that are facing rapid change and global competition. We’re also collaborating closely with the Kedge Business School in Bordeaux, looking to help the Okanagan Wine Leaders Forum better understand how expand access to international wine markets.  The net effect of our five new strategies will be to make UBC more innovative, improving everything from the quality of our teaching and research to the accountability of administrators, including me. Kelowna Chamber of Commerce  November 14, 2014  13 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Arvind Gupta We are turning UBC inside out, tearing down any remaining walls between us and you, putting our resources – human, physical and virtual – in service to the community.  And to be clear, by community I mean you, whether you are in industry, government or the non-profit sector, in high tech or health management. In every sector, our goal is to raise the bar, improving the health, prosperity and sustainability of the Okanagan Valley, the province, the country and the world. It’s a tall order in which I am, again, pleased to have such great partners. I want thank you again for coming today, and thank you as well for all that you have done – and will do – for UBC. I hope we can do even more for you. 
1.0357359~British Columbia 51st Leadership Prayer Breakfast~Ono, Santa Jeremy~		Briefing	Note	for	BC	Prayer	Breakfast		 	Prof.	Santa	J.	Ono	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 										British Columbia 51st Leadership Prayer Breakfast 	Santa	J.	Ono	Good morning to all of you. Thank you, Glen, for that wonderful introduction. I want to thank and salute every one of you for what you do to make Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and the world a better place. In many ways, I think Canada is a beacon for democracy and justice in the world today. The Economist says so, so it must be true! It is an honour and a responsibility, and I think that Canadians and British Columbians will really rise to that challenge. Your Honour, thanks for being here today, and thanks to all of you for giving me the great honour of addressing you at this 51st Annual British Columbia Leadership Prayer Breakfast. I think I was four years old when the first one took place, and I am sure it wasn’t this large, so it speaks to the power of God that we are all here together today. I was asked to give a little bit of testimony, a little bit of insight into my faith journey, and it certainly isn’t a remarkable one in any way, shape, or form. In many ways, it wasn’t meant to be. I think I owe it to God that I was able to find Jesus and I will tell you a little bit about how that came about. I was born in Vancouver in 1962, some years after my father and mother had emigrated from Japan to North America. At the time, my father was a professor of Mathematics at UBC, along with the amazing future President of UBC, Professor Walter Gage, who was also a member of that department. Some of you may remember him, and I know that President Gage not only took care of other faculty members in that department, but also a variety of individual students from all over the world, who were studying at UBC. This fact will resonate with my message, at the very end of my remarks. My mother and father were not believers and did not practice any religion. From kindergarten through 12th grade, despite growing up in predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant neighbourhoods, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore after leaving Vancouver as a toddler, I had very little concept of what happened in churches. I walked past them going to school, drove past them on the way to different places, learned how to play musical instruments, but I didn’t really know what happened inside churches. The only times we, as a family, would enter churches would be to listen to music. My father loves music, and we would go there on Christmas Eve, or to hear someone play in a church, just because that’s where the concert happened to be. I didn’t think the pews were very comfortable, but I was curious about what actually happened on Sundays, and on evenings and afternoons, that these churches, that were really nodes of activity, places where people built community. 		Briefing	Note	for	BC	Prayer	Breakfast		 	Prof.	Santa	J.	Ono	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 								In some ways, I was jealous of not being part of that mysterious activity happening in churches. I was curious about Easter and Christmas although I thought for the longest time that Easter was about the Easter Bunny, chocolate eggs, and baskets, and I thought that Christmas was about Santa Claus, and Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer. As a child, I was intrigued by Nativity scenes and the Christmas plays that took place in schools. But I thought that churches were community social clubs where people gathered on Sunday for coffee, and where my friends attended Boy Scouts group meetings. I was confused as to why people would get all dressed up on occasions like baptism or confirmation where, incidentally, my friends were very naughty while dressed in their Sunday best. My first introduction to God and Jesus occurred in my freshman year, as a student at the University of Chicago. With the sudden freedom of living far away from home, and with no parental guidance, I slipped into a trap that perhaps some of you did as well. I partied hard and frequently drank too much on Friday nights and weekends. Indeed, I think that part of my binge drinking had to do with a deep dissatisfaction with my life deep inside my soul—maybe a lack of a reference point, a lack of a spiritual anchor. However, I didn’t know it at the time. There was one particularly risky evening, when I had had far too much to drink, and was hanging from an open windowsill on the 5th floor of my residence hall, on a very cold night in Chicago. I don’t remember much about that evening other than that two of my friends rescued me from the windowsill and helped me get into bed. It was a very difficult night and they stayed by my side the entire time to ensure that I made it through. I am sure that many of you have some friends to whom you owe your lives. These two friends were very active in church on campus and started to take me with them to church services. We went to Bond chapel, a Catholic chapel, and to Rockefeller Church, the large church on the University of Chicago campus. They took me to Inter-Varsity groups, both large and small. They also took me back home to their suburbs to attend their churches, to meet with their ministers and mingle with their home congregations. In particular, they took me to their families for some family love, because they thought that I was lost. I remember feeling very special when I entered these churches. I felt chills down my spine as I knelt down to pray, not understanding what that meant. Although I had virtually no knowledge of the Bible, there was something about simply being in those churches that moved me as I had never been moved before. After graduating from the University of Chicago, I made my way back to Canada to be a graduate student in Experimental Medicine at McGill University. My girlfriend from Chicago was meant to join me in Montreal but she never ended up doing so, and I quickly spiralled into a deep depression. I began drinking again, heavily, and had suicidal thoughts. Fortunately, I encountered a fellow graduate student working in the Collaborator’s Laboratory at the Royal Victoria Hospital. She played the piano. I played the cello. The pianist’s name was Wendy Yip. Sometime later we would start dating, and eventually she became my wife. Wendy took me to her church. I was a doubtful, smart aleck non-believer when I accompanied her to church, even though I had already these feelings, these chills down my back whenever I entered a church. We would spend hours talking about why I had problems believing in God and Jesus. I had been educated as a scientist, to look for proof, and I could see no proof of the existence of God or Jesus. After many conversations, and my attendance at a Sunday School with 11-year- old kids, I started to understand the concept of faith, and the persuasiveness of the Bible and the power of those who believed, as evidence that there must be a God. 		Briefing	Note	for	BC	Prayer	Breakfast		 	Prof.	Santa	J.	Ono	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 								A particular pastor, Lloyd Pierce, of Westmount Baptist Church, worked with me and my faith emerged and grew stronger day by day. I’ll never forget the day I was baptized in Westmount Baptist Church, on a glorious, sunny Easter Day. Although my attendance at church would be variable, I became an even more committed Christian once my first daughter was born in Boston, Massachusetts. I started to serve as an acolyte at Trinity Church, an Anglican church, and eventually was promoted to lay Eucharistic minister. I was incredibly moved to carry the cross, as a crucifer, and to serve during normal services, weddings, funerals, and to bring bread and wine to those believers in that congregation. I would continue to do the same in England, and in Cincinnati, Ohio. There was a pivotal moment when I was a Senior Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs at Emery University in Atlanta. Emery was originally a Methodist university but is now a secular, multi-faith university. I discussed the issue of faith with then-president of the university, Jim Wagner, and also with a professor that I admired greatly, Tom Flynn, a Catholic priest. President Wagner was relatively open about his faith (he is a Presbyterian) but he reminded me that, as a senior administrator, it was important for me to respect and support staff, faculty, and students of every faith, as well as those who had not yet decided to believe. Professor Flynn, on the other hand, was different. Although he was a Catholic priest, he was extremely discreet about letting people know about his faith. He encouraged me to hide my Christianity and to be, as he said, “a stealth Christian.” And this from a Catholic priest! Partly, this was a safeguard against favouring one faith over another in a multi-faith institution. Partly, it was to protect oneself from the eventual, and sometimes real, criticism and bias from other secular or atheist professors who don’t believe there is any place for faith in the academy. After more than a year of considering the possible options, I made a decision not to be a “stealth Christian.” In fact, I decided to immerse myself in supporting students of all faiths at Emery University. I continued this practice at the University of Cincinnati, and now at UBC. At Emery, I was recognized as a Christian by local representatives of Inter-Varsity and asked both to sit on a local board, and to raise money for Inter-Varsity.  I accepted that request, gladly. I was also asked by the students themselves to serve as a faculty advisor to their chapter. My engagement with Inter-Varsity grew, and I would eventually be asked by Alex Hill, the immediate Past-President of Inter-Varsity USA, to be a member of the National Board of Trustees for Inter-Varsity. He was amazed that I would make time to travel to the board meetings around the country despite my having a heavy administrative role. Since moving to UBC, I have maintained my approach in supporting faculty, students, and staff in whatever faith they might practice, and regardless of whether they are believers or not. I also do not hide my Christianity and, occasionally, I pray for students at large student events such as Chapel at the Chan Centre at UBC where over 1,300 believers come together each semester. It’s powerful. It’s amazing. It’s a testimony to God. Let me thank you again for inviting me to address the British Columbia Leadership Prayer Breakfast. It is an enormous honour for anyone, but especially for someone like me, who probably wasn’t meant to be up here as a Christian; someone who started with no concept at all about God or Jesus or what happens within churches. I think what I have learned in my journey is that God is everywhere, not only in those churches, not only here today, but God is everywhere, wherever two or more are gathered. I hope that God will use me at UBC, in Vancouver, in British Columbia, and in Canada to spread the good news. More importantly, I hope that my engagement will, for at least for some students, be a transformative moment that will help them find Christ, just as two friends helped me, throughout the night, to find Christ 		Briefing	Note	for	BC	Prayer	Breakfast		 	Prof.	Santa	J.	Ono	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 								when I was a student at the University of Chicago. You see, I was a lost sheep when I first entered university. Could you please join me in this short prayer: Dear heavenly Father, thank you for bringing me back home to Vancouver. Thank you for connecting me when I was a lost sheep early in my life.  Thanks for bringing me in contact with my friends, during university, and my wife-to- be, in graduate school. Thanks for accepting me, despite my many, manifold flaws.  Dear God, please use me as your servant to spread the good news, and to support those who seek you.   And God, I pray that you hear the many voices of young people, and more established people, who cry out to you on a daily basis, both aloud, and perhaps more profoundly, silently, to be saved.  Dear God, let us all remember Matthew 9, verses 36-38: “But when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered like sheep having no shepherd. And he said to his disciples, ‘The harvest truly is plentiful, but the labourers are few. Therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest.’” Dear God, we praise you today for bringing together over 1000 labourers, who will go out, across the city, across this beautiful province, with compassion, as shepherds of lost sheep everywhere, to bring them to you for your love and salvation, to be part of your glorious kingdom.  We pray for all of our brothers and sisters, in Jesus’ name. Amen.

Ono		The	Ismaili	Centre	International	Lecture,	April	18,	2017,	Burnaby		Thank	you	very	much.			It’s	an	honour	and	privilege	to	be	with	you,	in	this	strikingly	beautiful	Ismaili	Centre.		For	nearly	four	decades,	the	Ismaili	Centre	has	offered	spaces	for	spiritual	contemplation,	as	well	as	social,	cultural	and	intellectual	gatherings.			The	Centre	truly	does	provide	a	bridge	to	friendship	and	understanding	for	the	wider	community,	and	opens	our	minds	and	hearts	to	pluralism	in	Canada	and	around	the	world.			This	is	a	message	that	resonates	personally	with	me.	My	own	experiences	have	made	me	very	aware	of	how	different	cultures	and	races	interact	and	are	treated,	in	higher	education	and	elsewhere.	I	appreciate	the	work	the	Centre	does	in	this	regard.	2	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	I’m	proud	to	say	that	the	University	of	British	Columbia	and	the	Ismaili	community	collaborate	on	a	number	of	initiatives;	globally	through	the	Aga	Khan	Development	Network	and	locally	through	the	Ismaili	Council	of	BC:		• An	agreement	to	enable	UBC	to	design	curriculum	for	use	by	University	of	Central	Asia	(UCA)	faculty	members	to	teach	Earth	and	Environmental	Sciences	Program.	• A	Memorandum	of	Understanding	to	help	prepare	young	Kenyans	to	teach	the	International	Baccalaureate	program	and	contribute	more	widely	to	the	improvement	of	education	in	Kenya.	• A	collaborative	project	between	UBC	and	UCA	researchers	to	guide	the	development	of	long-term	socio-ecological	research	by	UCA’s	Mountain	Societies	Research	Institute.	• UBC	faculty	Peter	Klein	was	a	consultant	for	the	Aga	Khan	Foundation	and	helped	to	create	the	School	of	Journalism	at	Aga	Khan	University	in	Nairobi.	• UBC	Okanagan’s	Professor	Hussein	Keshani,	in	partnership	with	the	Aga	Khan	Trust	for	Culture	and	the	Devonian	Botanical	Garden	in	Edmonton,	is	developing	a	digital	application	for	visitors	to	a	new	Islamic	Garden	that	the	3	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	Aga	Khan	gifted	to	the	University	of	Alberta.	• The	Aga	Khan	Development	Network	works	closely	with	UBC's	Human	Early	Learning	Partnership.	(to	name	a	few)		As	president	of	UBC,	I	am	also	proud	to	acknowledge	…	• Khalil	(Z.)	Shariff,	CEO	of	the	Aga	Khan	Foundation	of	Canada,	is	a	graduate	of	UBC.	(moderating	this	evening)	• Firoz	Rasul,	a	former	member	of	UBC's	Board	of	Governors,	is	President	of	Aga	Khan	University.	• Shamez	Mohamed,	responsible	for	building	the	Aga	Khan	Museum	in	Toronto	and	the	Global	Centre	for	Pluralism	in	Ottawa,	has	served	on	the	UBC's	Museum	of	Anthropology	external	advisory	board.	• UBC's	former	head	of	Pediatrics,	Dr.	Robert	Armstrong,	Professor	of	Pediatrics	and	Foundation	Dean	of	the	Aga	Khan	University	Medical	College,	was	responsible	for	establishing	a	new	Medical	College	as	part	of	a	Faculty	of	Health	Sciences	for	East	Africa	based	in	Nairobi.	• The	VGH	and	UBC	Hospital	Foundation	was	the	principal	beneficiary	of	the	2016	annual	Ismaili	Walk.		We	are	grateful	for	this	support.	4	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	I	might	add	that	the	Ismaili	Student	Association	at	UBC	is	a	very	active	student	group,	holding	weekly	meetings,	volunteering,	and	supporting	their	fellow	students.		This	year,	their	annual	fundraiser	provided	$6,000	to	the	Downtown	Eastside	Women’s	Centre.			This	evening,	the	topic	of	our	dialogue	is	“the	changing	role	of	higher	education	in	developing	the	next	generation	of	global	leaders.”		The	topic	is	almost	limitless	in	scope,	but	I	can	think	of	no	better	way	of	thinking	about	how	we	can	shape	future	leaders	than	by	the	example	of	His	Highness	the	Aga	Khan	through	sixty	years	of	global	leadership	and	tireless	humanitarian	service.	I’d	like	to	begin	by	sharing	some	of	the	words	His	Highness	spoke	in	Toronto	last	year	on	accepting	the	Inaugural	Adrienne	Clarkson	prize	for	Global	Citizenship.		Here	is	what	he	said:	“Perhaps	the	key	to	resolving	the	‘Paradox	of	Citizenship’	is	to	think	about	layers	of	overlapping	identity.		After	all,	one	can	honour	a	variety	of	loyalties	--	to	a	faith,	an	ethnicity,	a	language,	a	nation,	a	city,	a	profession,	a	school,	even	to	a	sports	team!		One	might	share	some	of	these	identities	with	some	people,	and	other	identities	with	others.	“My	own	religious	community	identifies	proudly	as	Ismaili	5	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	Muslims,	with	our	specific	interpretation	of	Islamic	faith	and	history.		But	we	also	feel	a	sense	of	belonging	with	the	whole	of	the	Muslim	world,	what	we	call	the	Ummah.		Within	the	Ummah,	the	diversity	of	identities	is	immense	--	greater	than	most	people	realize	--	differences	based	on	language,	on	history,	on	nationhood,	ethnicity	and	a	variety	of	local	affiliations.		But,	at	the	same	time,	I	observe	a	growing	sense	within	the	Ummah	of	a	meaningful	global	bond.	“When	the	question	of	human	identity	is	seen	in	this	context,	then	diversity	itself	can	be	seen	as	a	gift.		Diversity	is	not	a	reason	to	put	up	walls,	but	rather	to	open	windows.		It	is	not	a	burden;	it	is	a	blessing.		In	the	end	of	course,	we	must	realize	that	living	with	diversity	is	a	challenging	process.		We	are	wrong	to	think	it	will	be	easy.		The	work	of	pluralism	is	always	a	work	in	progress.”	As	a	university	president,	I	find	his	words	especially	relevant	and	inspiring.		The	very	nature	of	a	post-secondary	environment	is	a	place	to	foster	diversity,	as	students	encounter	people	whose	views	and	backgrounds	differ	from	their	own.		Higher	education	is	a	transformative	experience,	as	students	learn	not	only	about	themselves,	but	others	as	well.			In	an	open	learning	environment,	students	need	to	be	able	to	build	successful	networks	and	collaborations	that	are	diverse	and	global	in	order	to	pragmatically	understand	and	experience	6	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	pluralism.	The	spirit	of	innovation	and	global	citizenship	is	very	much	at	the	heart	of	what	we	are	trying	to	do	in	our	colleges,	polytechnics,	and	universities	today.		Traditional	methods	of	teaching	and	learning	are	being	transformed	as	we	prepare	our	students	to	meet	the	challenges	of	a	world	very	different	from	the	one	encountered	by	their	parents	and	grandparents.		Students	today	have	progressed	far	beyond	the	passive	recipients	of	information	they	were	in	the	old	days.		Today,	professors	tend	to	be	facilitators,	creating	the	right	environments	for	students	to	acquire	information	in	a	variety	of	dynamic	ways.	Courses	in	many	areas,	such	as	law,	medicine,	and	engineering,	are	often	case-based	or	problem-based,	requiring	students	to	work	collaboratively	in	teams	to	find	solutions—and	preparing	them	for	the	way	problems	are	tackled	in	the	working	world	beyond	university.			Higher	education	is	responding	to	pressures	for	change	by	introducing	new	courses	to	prepare	students	for	work	in	fields	that	barely	existed	a	decade	ago.		At	UBC,	for	example,	students	in	Arts	can	now	take	a	program	in	Cognitive	Systems,	in	which	the	participating	units	are	Philosophy,	Psychology,	Linguistics,	and	Computer	Science.		Through	the	interrelated	7	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	study	of	these	fields,	the	students	gain	a	comprehensive	understanding	of	human	cognition,	and	learn	to	apply	this	knowledge	to	create	intelligent	artificial	systems.			The	traditional	barriers	between	disciplines	are	disappearing	as	we	try	to	prepare	students	for	the	demands	of	the	working	world.		So,	for	example,	a	student	in	Applied	Science	can	twin	her	studies	in	hydraulic	engineering	with	a	program	in	entrepreneurship,	so	that	she	is	prepared	for	the	post-university	challenges	of	commercializing	and	monetizing	her	skills.	Many	more	examples	can	be	found,	in	both	the	so-called	STEM	fields	(science,	technology,	engineering	and	mathematics)	and	in	the	arts	&	social	sciences.	Indeed,	I’ve	been	telling	people	that	we	need	to	add	the	Arts	to	that	acronym	and	talk	about	STEAM,	not	STEM.		The	Arts	and	STEM	subjects	are	now	beginning	to	intersect	in	ways	we	could	never	have	predicted	a	few	years	ago.	Such	interrelatedness	is	essential	if	we	are	to	give	our	students	the	kind	of	preparation	that	will	prepare	them	for	a	profession	beyond	the	BA	or	the	BSc	in	an	increasingly	technology-oriented	workplace.	Through	a	combination	of	carefully	crafted	curricular	learning	objectives	in	the	classroom	and	experiential	learning	in	8	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	internships	or	co-ops,	the	liberal	arts	student	at	UBC	is	encouraged	to	cultivate	a	unique	professional	identity,	an	identity	that	reflects	their	personal	interests	while	at	the	same	time	giving	them	the	tools	they	need	to	succeed	in	a	world	that	is	increasingly	shaped	by	science	and	technology.	And	on	the	other	side	of	the	coin,	engineering	and	science	graduates	are	beginning	to	discover	the	social	and	ethical	implications	of	their	disciplines	through	new	breadth	requirements	and	arts	electives.	What	we’re	all	aiming	for	is	to	create	an	environment	in	which	our	students	are	exposed	to	a	variety	of	ideas,	and	acquire	the	knowledge	and	skills	that	will	enable	them	to	achieve	their	personal	goals	and	become	responsible	members	of	society,	regardless	of	their	choice	of	profession.		And	then,	of	course,	there’s	the	whole	area	of	information	technology.		The	huge	expansion	of	digital	tools	has	revolutionized	the	business	of	teaching	and	learning.		Many	courses	now	take	a	blended	approach,	mixing	face-to-face	presentations	with	online	or	video	presentations.		Students	now	have	instantaneous	access	to	vast	electronic	databases,	and	require	a	sophisticated	understanding	of	software	tools	to	access	and	use	that	information.	9	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	Many	students	also	have	the	benefit	of	co-op	education	programs,	where	they	can	gain	invaluable	work	experience	before	they	graduate.		UBC	offers	a	program	called	Go	Global,	where	we	partner	with	over	200	universities	and	institutions	worldwide	for	students	to	study	abroad	for	a	semester.		Leaving	home	to	study	in	another	country,	students	learn	to	approach	different	situations	and	people	with	respect	and	sensitivity,	to	remain	humble,	to	make	the	effort	to	learn	things	about	other	cultures,	and	to	become	aware	of	their	own	biases	So	you	can	see	that	higher	education	is	preparing	a	highly	skilled,	tech	savvy,	and	cosmopolitan	workforce.		However,	I	don’t	think	we	can	we	talk	about	developing	the	next	generation	of	global	leaders,	without	talking	about	their	need	for	jobs.			Could	any	students	embarking	on	a	degree	program	in	2004	have	predicted	the	economic	situation	awaiting	them	on	graduation	in	2008?		The	precarity	of	new	graduates	with	$50,000	in	student	loans	to	repay,	seeking	a	position	in	their	field	during	a	depressed	economy,	cannot	be	overstated.		That	is	why	I’d	like	to	spend	a	few	moments	on	how	the	post-secondary	education	sector	plays	an	important	role	as	an	economic	growth	engine.		Recently,	I	was	honored	to	be	appointed	by	the	premier	as	Chief	Advisor	for	the	BC	10	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	Innovation	Network.	This	is	an	open,	collaborative	network	that	will	bridge	the	efforts	of	industry,	government	and	post-secondary	institutions.		One	of	the	most	important	ways	the	B.C.	post-secondary	sector	is	contributing	to	the	economy	is	through	research	clusters.		These	are	interdepartmental	networks	of	leaders	in	particular	fields	who	are	brought	together	to	investigate	large	problems	through	collaborative	research.		One	UBC	example	is	a	cluster	formed	by	bringing	together	researchers	from	the	Faculty	of	Forestry,	Botany,	the	Michael	Smith	Laboratories,	Biodiversity,	and	the	Faculty	of	Land	and	Food	Systems.	They	have	formed	a	forestry	and	plant	productivity	group	studying	plant	genomics	and	bio-products	from	renewable	resources.		Other	BC	post-secondary	institutions	can	provide	similar	examples.	By	working	together,	we	can	promote	stronger	links	between	the	B.C.	companies	that	depend	on	the	availability	of	talented	people,	and	the	colleges,	technical	institutes	and	universities	that	are	responsible	for	training	and	educating	our	students	to	take	on	those	jobs.	Another	component	in	fostering	global	citizenship	is	the	role	of	international	students.		At	one	time	the	idea	of	11	Ismaili	Centre	Speech,	April	18,	2017	internationalizing	the	university	was	seen	as	something	threatening	and	undesirable,	because	it	was	thought	that	such	students	were	taking	seats	that	should	be	reserved	for	domestic	students	only.			But	under	my	predecessors,	UBC	began	to	expand	international	enrolment,	recognizing	that	there	is	a	huge	pool	of	potential	talent,	investment,	and	immigration	that	will	be	of	immense	benefit	to	this	country.		Recruitment	of	top	international	students	brings	with	it	future	networks	that	will	enhance	connections	with	our	international	partners.	Let	me	share	with	you	the	words	of	one	of	UBC’s	international	graduate	students,	from	the	valedictory	address	given	by	Dr.	Olga	Pena,	on	receiving	her	PhD	in	Microbiology	and	Immunology.

1.0357362~Imagine Day 2017~Ono, Santa Jeremy~Imagine Day 2017 Sept. 5, 2017 Santa J. Ono  Thank you! Well, I've been waiting for today for several months. People have been working really hard trying to choose you. As you probably know, there are about 30,000 people who applied to this institution to have the privilege and opportunity to be in your place. You are an awesome group of individuals. It was not easy to select you from everyone else that applied. Let's hear it for you for being here today.   Now, you probably don't remember when you were a toddler. In 1962, I was on this campus. My dad was a professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia, and it's a very special institution to our family for a number of reasons. My father was actually invited to come to North America by a brilliant physicist, some of you may know, his name is Robert Oppenheimer. And you know who he is. Wow. And it meant a lot to us because my parents didn't have much. In fact, they came to this country with everything in one suitcase and no money. And it was this University, the University of British Columbia, that gave our family a chance to make it in this wonderful country, in this wonderful continent. And it's for that reason that it was a privilege, it was a dream come true, for me to come back to where I was a toddler. This is a very special place that you've joined. It's a great community of scholars and you have surrounding you some of the best and brightest young minds in the world and from all over the world. Isn't that amazing?  And I can tell you from working with the students, they're older than you. It's people like Allan. Let's hear it for Allan. Let's hear it for our president, Allan.  I can tell you that the students here are not only bright, but they're passionate, that they should be inspirations to you as you embark on this part of your journey.  So why did I talk about being a toddler? Well, you won't remember this because you were a toddler and people usually don't remember back that far. But if you talk to your parents or look at some videos or some photographs of when you were a toddler, that magical moment-- if you're a parent or you have a younger sibling, that magical moment when that toddler starts to try to walk is something that will forever be part of a memory of that individual. You've seen babies. First, they can crawl, then they try to walk and then they'd fall down. They grab onto your finger and they try to walk and they fall. And they fall over and over again. But guess what? They get up and they keep trying until they're successful in taking that first step. And a lot of us as parents have videos of our kids as toddlers taking that first step and it's magical but its also significant. It shows that every single one of you has this drive, that you won't be defeated by something you haven't done before. And you've shown not only with that, some of you may be skateboarders, or you might have remembered-- you probably do remember the first time you tried to ride your bicycle, right? Do you remember that?  What happened? Remember when your mom or dad or brother was holding the seat, and you had training wheels, and then they took the training wheels off? Remember? Well, at least for me, I fell down. I scraped my elbows and my knees. But guess what? I wasn't going to let that stop me, just like you. Because I wanted to learn how to ride a bicycle. We're all the same. Everyone here, the deans, distinguished faculty, they were all toddlers. I have some photos of them-- no I don't [laughter]. But we've all been there. They're just older than you. But they all remember, poignantly, with love, what it was like to be you, to be a first-year student coming into a great institution full of other amazing people. Well, I know that a lot of you are pretty excited. You come from all over the world. You're at one of the world's best universities. And you should be proud just like your parents should be proud, and your teachers are proud, and we are proud of what you've done to get here. Because you've learned to walk, you've learned to ride a bicycle or maybe skateboard. But you've done a lot of other things. You got a 90.5 at least. That's pretty amazing. Hey, let's go for it. Let's hear it for you guys!   But is there anyone here, I'm wondering -- let me tell you what I was like when I was in your shoes. My parents put me on a train from Baltimore, Maryland, to go to the University of Chicago, a place I'd never been. I got off at the train station, saw the Sears Tower, didn't know anybody, made my way to the strange University I had never seen, just read about. And I was scared. I got this form from the financial aid office saying, "You only have half enough money that you need to pay for your education, so you're going to have to work". And I had to work two jobs because we didn't have a lot of money being immigrants. And somehow, even though I was scared, even though things were tough, I'm still standing. That's not special. That's not special.  It's the same story for all of these amazing people that surround me. All I'm trying to say is that if you're scared like I was, it's perfectly normal. It's perfectly okay. Because we were all in that position as well. And guess what? There's nothing wrong with being a little nervous or scared because when you're scared, it means only one thing, that you're about to do something very brave. That's what you're doing. You're doing something very brave. Let's hear it for you again!   The other thing I want to just say is that you remember your mom or your dad or your uncle or your brother or sister, when you were trying to learn how to ride that bike for the first time, taking off those training wheels? We feel the same way about you. We are here because of you. The university exists because of you.  This institution used to be called McGill University of British Columbia. But about 101 years ago it was students, your students, your predecessors who said, "We want a university of our own in this province", and they had this great trek from downtown Vancouver to here, to show how important it was to them to have a great university here in British Columbia. Let's hear it for them for making this possible for you.  And today, just 101 years later, not only are we a different university from McGill University, but-- please don't quote me, we're a better university than McGill University.  I can say so with confidence because I just came back from London, England. By the way, if anybody loves McGill University it's got to be me because I have a degree from there. I got my Ph.D. from there, found my wife there. I love McGill so no knock on McGill, it's a great university too, but we're better!  You're not tweeting that, right? McGill's going to get pretty upset at me. So how can I say that with confidence? I just came back from London, England, and somebody from London-- pretty great city, right? Pretty great city. I was at something called the Times Higher Education World Academic Summit and there were 500 presidents there from the best universities around the world. And guess who was asked to speak reflecting the esteem by which those institutions are regarded by their peers? The president and vice-chancellor of Oxford University was asked to speak in the plenary session. The president of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was asked to speak. The president of New York University was asked to speak. The president of Humboldt University was asked to speak. And the president of your university, UBC, was asked to speak.  And we used to say that UBC is 1 of the 40 best universities in the world, and today we can say that we're in the top 31 universities in the world.  And I believe-- and that's why I'm here-- that the sky is the limit, and we're going to get there because of these great deans and vice presidents and faculty. And because of you, UBC is on a trajectory which is the envy of the world. And you're going to be part of the ride. Are you excited?   Now there's something else. There's this phrase that means a lot to me, that is, to those to whom much has been given, much is expected. So here you are at one of the most distinguished, most respected, comprehensive research universities in the world. And so the presidents were all there together in the Kelvin Room of the Institute of Engineers.  And guess what we talked about? We talked about the state of the world. We talked about how good a job we are doing. As those that are just several decades older than you, how good are we doing in protecting the planet which will ultimately be handed off to you? Imagine that. 500 people, average age 60-years-old in the Kelvin Room at King's College, London, and we talked about the question, how good are we doing in protecting the planet that is on loan to us, that we need to hand to you? Because, you see, that's a responsibility of all of us, especially those of us who are privileged and educated and in positions of influence to make decisions that determine the fate of the planet.  I was at UBC Okanagan earlier today, and a student body present there asked a question to all the students. He said, "How many of you believe the state of the world is healthy?" Let me ask the same question. Do you believe the state of the world is healthy? If so, raise your hand. Guess what? It was the same thing in the Okanagan. And therein defines our collective responsibility as individuals that are gifted and privileged, individuals that have with that gift, great expectations. In our case, expectations from you. In your case, because you will be, some of you, potentially, the next prime minister of Canada or head of another state. Three UBC graduates have gone on to be Prime Ministers of Canada. Isn't that pretty awesome?  Several have gone on to be CEOs of multinational companies, Nobel laureates, influential people in every possible sector of human activity. So we talked about these grand challenges, the presidents there in London. We talked about issues of energy, clean energy, climate change, health disparities, the problem of having sufficient clean water and getting it to people who are thirsty, the problem of having enough food and being able to get it to people, entire regions of this planet where people are hungry. We can say it's not our problem, as some people say. You might say, "It's not really true. Don't trust the experts. Climate change isn't really a reality." We could do that. We can say it's not our problem, but then I'd say we, collectively, and individually, are failing in our responsibility to the world, where we are uniquely positioned to do something about these grand challenges.  Now, look around you. You see engineers, individuals in the arts.  Individuals in the sciences.  Think you're over there.  We've got some kinesiology folks. I think you're over there.  It's amazing. We have some dentists over there, if I recall.  With those bright shiny lights, right? Well, guess what? Not only do we have the responsibility--     This incredible diversity that you have around you, this incredible expertise for a faculty and of your own future potential, this diversity that exists in this institution, is an incredible gift. It's an incredible reservoir that will really form the foundation for the future solutions for these grand challenges. And I ask you one thing - I'm going to ask you a couple of things before I finish - but one thing, that is to embrace the diversity around you, the diversity in every sense of the word. Embrace the fact that you're from 130 countries. Embrace the fact that there are so many different ethnicities here, that there are people with many different religious beliefs. The fact that there are people who do not have religious beliefs. Embrace the fact that around you are people that agree with you on difficult questions and issues. Embrace that and listen to what they have to say because it's incredibly important for your formation as a human being and citizen. And the fact that you have such a diverse group of people here is one of the greatest gifts that you can potentially gain from being in an institution such as UBC. Let me explain to you why. All of those presidents in that room agreed that if anyone or any institution has the capacity to address what ails this planet, they are the people in the research universities. Everyone agreed that it is going to take more than one university, more than one specialty, to solve the grand challenges of the world. These are major issues and it's going to require that each of you work as teams in a multidisciplinary way to try to address these challenges. And it's going to require more than one institution to solve these problems. We have to collaborate for a better world.  And how can you do this? I mean, how can you take advantage of the situation? For example, to address one of the most vexing problems that has been part of society for eternity, that is achieving world peace. Who here doesn't want to have peace in the world? Well, I argue that you will learn how to do it here because there are people with different points of view. And I think that one of the things that you have to do from day one, and for the entirety of your career, is to realize that to achieve this individually and to solve these grand challenges of the world, not only do you have to listen to each other, sometimes in very uncomfortable conversations, but you have to subscribe to the fundamental tenant that there is freedom of speech and that even those of you that you disagree with fundamentally at an institution such as UBC, one of the central cores of this institution is that we embrace academic freedom. Do you embrace that?   I knew the answer because Michael Griffin, a professor who I respect enormously in the arts, was working with a group in JumpStart and he shared with me a word cloud of the values held dear by you. And at the very center of that word cloud were honesty, academic freedom, and freedom of speech. Those were some of the biggest words that were highlighted as things important to you and your generation and I applaud you for that because that's the first step in embracing diversity and using that to solve the most vexing problems of the world. It requires-- and you already know this-- that you embrace civility, that you are decent to each other and respectful to each other, regardless of how angry you might feel inside about a view that is different than yours. And it is our responsibility, as your deans, your president, your vice presidents, your chancellor, your professors, it is our responsibility to create an environment where that can be done in a respectful, civil, safe way. But it is also your responsibility to help us create that environment. And if you collectively embrace, as you're articulated to me, that belief in the fundamental tenant of academic freedom and freedom of speech and civil discourse, that is such an incredibly powerful foundation for us together, to be as an institution, and as individuals, global change agents for a better world.  Now, as I said, this is not easy. Sometimes you'll be very upset by somebody saying something that you don't agree with. And you can respond and say that you don't agree. But let's all agree to one thing because we agree fundamentally that the solutions to these problems require collaboration. Let's agree that this is a time to build bridges, not to build walls. Do we agree on that one?  And do we agree that we reject, unilaterally, hate and violence, even in the most heated of conversations? Do we agree upon that?  And as an educational institution - now I'm about to wrap up because people are upset because I'm only supposed to speak for 8 minutes and I've probably spoken for 16, but I think this is important on day one - let us commit, each and every one of us, as a educational institution, perhaps as one of the remaining bastions committed to evidence-based reasoning in a global society where truth and post-truth and alternative facts are really challenging what is happening in the fabric of society. Let us commit to evidence-based reasoned opinions in every question, especially those that are difficult. Do we commit to that?   I'm sorry. I'm a little bit passionate. But I'll tell you why. One thing that I say-- and you'll hear it over and over again-- is that there are two kinds of education, there's a kind of education that happens everywhere, it's called the education of the mind. It's what you read in those textbooks, it's what you hear from your professor, it's what you're examined on. That's one kind of education. But you are a University of British Columbia student and we expect more than that kind of education. Because the other kind of education that Allen spoke about, I submit, is even more important in your formation as an individual, but also as a human being and citizen, and global change agent for a better world, and that is an education of the heart.  Let me explain. There's all kind of brilliant people that have been educated the finest institutions. I'll give you a couple examples. There was someone called Josef Mengele, a brilliantly educated physician, who was an evil physician, who was there at concentration camps making decisions about who lived and who died in the Holocaust, who decided to experiment on Holocaust and Jewish individuals, children in concentration camps. You see, that person had the education of the mind, but clearly didn't have an education of the heart, the kind of education that comes from a commitment to respecting civil discourse, to putting yourself in a situation where you try to understand a different view, to commit to building bridges and not building walls. That is a kind of education we want you to have at the University of British Columbia. Do you understand?  This takes work. And I'll tell you, not everyone is going to want to engage with you in these kinds of conversations. But you are active participants in this community of scholars. You are equals with us in these conversations, in these dialogues. You should challenge us. You can make us a better institution.  I'm going to end with these two words that Frank Wesbrook, the first president of UBC, uttered to his first group of first year students. You're going to hear it all over the place. You've seen it, you know what the words are, but really think about what they mean. Tuum Est, two meanings for that, one is, it's yours. And that's true. Every single one of you, regardless of where you're from, what you're studying, what your circumstances are, whether you're prepared right now for your course of study, or whether you think you got to really work hard to catch up to be up there in terms of preparation to your peers, it's yours. It's all yours.   Take advantage of each other. Take advantage of the great professors that are here. Take advantage of all the lectures and the events and programs and activities that are here because you have one shot at it. Carpe diem, seize the day. And here's the second thing, the second meaning for Tuum Est, which I think in many ways is even more profound. It's not that it's there for you, it's yours. More importantly, if you get this part it'll really drive you. The other meaning is, it's up to you. Tuum Est. I'll tell you, you're all amazing people. You all have the potential to become anything. So I ask you this, will you be somebody that exhibits just an education of the mind, that might use that education like Bernie Madoff did on a Ponzi scheme? To use that intelligence for your own self-enrichment? In that case, taking $65 billion of people's life savings so that he can live the high life? Very bright guy. He had an education of the mind, but he didn't have an education of the heart. Or will you be someone like Nelson Mandela or somebody like that?  I'll tell you this much, that's the part that's really profound. Tuum Est, it's up to you. And I can tell you, I have confidence that each and every one of you has it within you to use your gifts and use your formation here to become global change agents, to use this place as an institution to grow as a human being and collectively, through collaboration, through building bridges, and through love, to make this world a better place. Welcome to the University of British Columbia.       
1.0357366~Installation speech : President Santa Jeremy Ono, University of British Columbia~Ono, Santa Jeremy~Installation speech President Santa Jeremy Ono University of British Columbia November 22, 2016   Good Morning and welcome to the University of British Columbia   I wish to acknowledge the location of UBC’s two main campuses on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Musqueam people and the Syilx people of the Okanagan Nation Alliance. We acknowledge not only the history of these communities, but the importance of our present and future relationships, and will work to be sure they remain strong and vital.  Chancellor Lindsay Gordon, Chairman Stuart Belkin and members of the Board of Governors, It is a distinct honour that you have chosen me to serve as the 15th President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of British Columbia. Thank you for granting me this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I'm especially honoured by the presence of government officials and official representatives from 22 universities. I am invigorated by the many UBC faculty, staff and students who are in our presence. I have agreed to serve UBC because of you and I look forward to our years together in this remarkable community of scholars.   And I am of course honoured by the presence of my family and friends who have in many cases traveled long distances to be with me today. In particular I would like to thank my wife Wendy and my daughters Juliana and Sarah for accompanying me to Vancouver, Wendy’s mother Alice Chan-Yip for always being there for us, my amazing brothers Momoro Ono (Professor of Piano at Creighton University) and Ken Ono (Professor of Mathematics at Emory University) for inspiring me with their extraordinary talent and accomplishments and especially my parents: Professor Takashi Ono (a former member of the UBC faculty) and my mother Sachiko Ono for bringing me into this world exactly 54 years ago tomorrow - right here in Vancouver - and for all they have done to support me over the years. Thanks mom and dad!  I am especially touched that this Installation Ceremony is taking place in this magnificent Chan Centre for the Performing Arts; an iconic Bing Thom-designed architectural and acoustic masterpiece shaped like my beloved cello and site of UBC’s Convocation Ceremonies.  How fitting and special it was to hear my friend Miguel Roig-Francoli’s rendition of Oh Canada! played by 14 cellos. Each cello represents one of Canada's 10 provinces, 3 Territories and our First Nations.   And let me say from the outset that I am humbled to follow 13 previous presidents of this university who have faithfully and diligently built upon the work of their predecessor to make UBC the stunning institution that it is today. I also acknowledge the work of previous Chancellors and Chairpersons of the Board of Governors who have worked in partnership with those presidents to move the University forward.  Will the former presidents, Chancellors and Board Chairs in our midst today please stand? Let's thank all of these men and women with a round of applause.  Now, although I have been hard at work for three months, I think it's important for me - on this installation day - to articulate to you what I hope to accomplish during my tenure as your president. Fundamentally, I reiterate my promise to you, when I was first introduced to the community, that I shall do everything in my power to move the University of British Columbia - already one of the world’s great universities - from excellence to eminence.   Some of you will remember that I promised then to first listen to the members of the UBC community to learn more about this great institution, its ethos and its hopes and dreams. And since that day, I have enjoyed speaking with scores of faculty, staff and students and I'm constantly amazed by their intellect, passion and love for the University.  I have also had the privilege of speaking to over a thousand alumni of the University. Via those conversations, I have learned a great deal about the evolution of this great institution and the accomplishments of over 317,000 living graduates of UBC.   The graduates of UBC excel in practically every field of human endeavor. Three graduates have served as Prime Minister of Canada - including the incumbent Justin Trudeau. Seven members of the UBC faculty have won the Nobel prize. Well over 200 current members of the faculty are members of academies such as the Royal Society, Royal Society of Canada, the US National Academies and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. 70 graduates have been awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and 65 graduates have won an Olympic medal.   The University now spans two magnificent campuses in Vancouver and the Okanagan sprawling over more than 1,500 acres. Part of the health sciences campus surrounds the Vancouver General Hospital, and a downtown location sits at Robson Square. Not only are the campuses breathtaking in their  settings; they house some of the most advanced facilities for modern research in the world. $600 million in funding flows through the university on an annual basis, cementing UBC’s position as a global research centre. UBC is home to TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics and our Quantum Matter Institute. And UBC is also home to cutting edge laboratories in the basic, applied and biomedical sciences. Site directed mutagenesis (the ability to alter genes, and a pillar of biotechnology) was invented here and UBC is at the frontier of research on cancer genomics and personalized medicine. UBC clinician/scientists are leading the global effort to eradicate AIDS. Our applied scientists and computer scientists have helped usher in some of the latest technologies available to humankind. Our work in sustainability and land use is at the very forefront and our scholarship in the humanities and social sciences and the liberal and performing arts is stunning in its breadth and depth. Scores of our departments are considered among the very best in the world. Clearly, UBC is already an excellent institution.  But where do we go from here? What might the future hold as we begin our second century of existence? Well first, let us acknowledge the miracle of this institution’s first 100 years. Very few institutions can claim to have joined the ranks of the world’s top 25 to 30 universities in just one century. Most of the other universities of this rank are two, three, four even eight centuries old. Just 50 years ago, UBC was a strong regional university. It's medical school was still very new and occupied a small single-story building on this campus. Five decades later, the university has been transformed into a global centre of research with many of our faculty members working at the penetrating cutting edge of knowledge creation.  If one looks at recent history, one can see a clear impact of President Martha Piper in elevating UBC’s status as a major research university. During Stephen Toope’s tenure, one can see clearly that he enhanced the student experience, helped position UBC as a leader in the development of new ways of teaching and helped build our standing as a global university.   Beginning this chapter of the university's history, we have begun the strategic planning process that will serve as our road map for UBC’s Second Century. Hundreds of submissions from faculty, staff, students and alumni have already been received from a call to engage earlier this summer. Two full day retreats involving the Executive Committee and the Deans have taken place and a website portal capturing the strategic plans for all 14 faculties and all future input will be launched shortly. This will be followed by a comprehensive strategic planning process to identify enterprise-wide priorities for the university. Specific action steps and a multi-year financial plan will be developed to guide the implementation of our new strategic plan. There will be multiple opportunities for input and feedback as we develop the plan. All of this will be captured in our dedicated website.   Let me share with you some of the values and themes that have already come through at this early stage. First, it is clear that this university wishes to focus even more intently on education and research as its core priorities. Throughout the institution everyone is united in elevating the university’s standing in these two areas so as to count ourselves among the very best in the world.   With respect to teaching, we want to expand our global leadership role in innovating new ways of teaching. At UBC we do not see education as a credential or commodity. It is the transformation that occurs within our students that allows them to think critically and creatively. And we are committed to teaching values, as we realize that (as Aristotle said) “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”  We will also work to ensure that the curricula we offer in all of our many programs is responsive to the concerns of Indigenous people, offers depth and full consideration of issues of importance, and that an understanding of Indigenous history—and a full and accurate understanding of Canadian history—is part of the education of all students, whatever their field of study. The development of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at UBC is a major commitment in moving towards this goal. In short, UBC is committed to being a leader in truth and reconciliation.   And with respect to research, we will strengthen our existing areas of research excellence and invest in new and emerging areas of research and scholarship. This will require that we invest in our current faculty and recruit some of the best scholars in the world in the near future to UBC. There is no investment that is more critical to the  university than our investment in the faculty. Our standing as a research university and our attractiveness as a destination for the best and brightest students all rest with the quality of our faculty.   We also recognize that past practices of university-lead research have at some points worked to the detriment of First Nations and other Indigenous communities, and we are committed to advancing and promoting research that is collaboratively developed and speaks clearly to community priorities.   UBC should always place as a priority basic and fundamental research and scholarship.  We cannot sacrifice basic research or scholarship in the liberal arts by focussing all of our attention on applied science and technology. Scholarship in the liberal arts form the foundation of an educated human being and citizen and is the reservoir for future innovation. Divesting from such core activities within the academy is tantamount to mortgaging one's future for current day opportunities.   There is also clear sentiment across the institution that we can differentiate ourselves from other great universities by committing ourselves as an institution to solving some of the grand challenges that face humanity: clean water, sustainable and renewable energy, chronic diseases and global food availability. We are already investing toward this end. Our new Public Scholars Initiative of the Graduate School supports a select group of our best graduate students to focus their thesis research on solving grand challenges. And our Liu Institute for Global Issues is already a major interdisciplinary centre focused on solving issues such as sustainability, social justice, conflict resolution and global warming.   But UBC can and shall do more. Research universities have unparalleled R&D teams. The solutions to the world's most vexing grand challenges reside within the academy. And UBC can establish itself as one of the world's leading universities in taking on these grand challenges head on. You see, we don't just want to be a great university, we want be a great university that does good.   There is also a common thread that UBC wishes to be one of the world’s most innovative universities. Currently we enjoy the designation by Reuters as Canada’s most innovative university, ranking among the top 50 most innovative universities globally. But we aspire to do even better.   To accomplish this, I have already asked the Executive to look at what we do internally to support Innovation at UBC. And I have spoken with both national and provincial leaders indicating that we must critically assess the Canadian innovation ecosystem so that we can develop both provincial and national plans to build our innovation economy. Our BCTech strategy is already a major step toward this end and Ministers Duncan and Bains are already actively working to strengthen the innovation pipeline from basic research all the way to commercialization. Each of us must ensure that these initial steps lead to an integrated plan for innovation in Canada. In short, we envision a future UBC that is a catalyst for many more new technologies and spin off companies, with an even greater economic impact on Vancouver and Kelowna. In so doing we will elevate Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the world.   A third common theme involves our wish to enhance significantly the student experience for all of our students. We will continue to think about how to enhance the student experience both in and outside the classroom. The Science Education Initiative lead by Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman - our multi-year project aimed at dramatically improving undergraduate science education has lead the world in new ways of teaching science to undergraduates and has been emulated by other great universities such as Stanford and indeed by nations. We will continue to innovate how we teach in the classroom and by increasing the number of students involved in experiential learning. Depending on the student this might take the form of work integrated learning or Co-ops, research experiences or study abroad. Our data clearly show a correlation between student satisfaction and experiential learning. For that reason, moving forward, we must work to make such opportunities available to all of our students.   Finally, a fourth common theme that has emerged is a desire to enhance our connection within British Columbia and our standing as Canada's most international university. Within Vancouver and British Columbia we will develop plans for deeper engagement. We will build upon existing initiatives such as: 1) faculty, staff and students from various faculties serving in our Vancouver City Studios; working to make Vancouver a better place to live, work and play 2) our UBC School of Community and Regional Planning working directly with the Musqueam community in their strategic planning. And we will identify new opportunities to connect with and strengthen our communities. Here at UBC we understand that universities have a responsibility to forge strong connections with their communities. The modern day university cannot be an Ivory Tower. In the years ahead, you will see an even more engaged UBC with broader and deeper connections with our local community.   To strengthen our global standing, we will re-structure our international programs and initiatives into a single office, identify a world class leader to oversee our global connections and develop a multi-year international engagement strategy. It has long been recognized that our geographical location on the Pacific Rim affords us a strategic advantage in developing substantive scholarly relationships with the growing number of major research universities in this region. Enhancing these relationships has already begun with institutions on the west coast of the United States - such as University of Washington, and will involve other PAC-12 universities as well as the major universities in Asia and Australia with which we already enjoy significant bilateral agreements.   In summary our next strategic plan: Excellence to Eminence will detail the steps UBC will take to become an even stronger university. We will set forth quantifiable stretch goals for each initiative and measure our progress on a regular basis. We will garner the necessary resources to fuel our plan and implement the plan over multiple years.   I want to end by articulating some common principles that aren't in most strategic plans, but that are fundamentally important. You see, the ultimate success or failure of institutions requires special ingredients beyond a strategy and resources. I have no doubt that we will have both of those  essential ingredients.   Firstly, we must be true to the mission of research universities. Although universities such as UBC have become among the largest employers in the nation with multi-billion dollar budgets and even larger economic impact, universities are not businesses. Universities have a much more profound responsibility to society as we know it today. But perhaps more importantly, universities have a responsibility to future generations. Universities are the archives of the universe of knowledge upon which current day society has been built. Universities are the source of new ideas and values upon which future society will be built. Universities are the guardians of truth and culture. Universities are incubators for future leaders. Universities are (and should forever be) venues for critical inquiry and debate where the values of future society will emerge. No institution will influence what the future world will look like more than the research university. And for these reasons we must ensure that universities like UBC retain the ability to fulfill each of these noble functions.   Second, let us all appreciate that what will ultimately determine whether UBC can move from excellence to eminence - into that stratosphere of the world’s leading universities - is a common purpose involving all of us.   One of my predecessors as president of the University of Cincinnati, the celebrated expert on leadership theory and advisor to four US presidents - the late Warren Bennis - once said something to this effect “there is a myth that a university president has power and control over where the institution is headed. In actuality I sometimes feel like the groundskeepers have more control over what's happening than I do.” And there is some truth to his statement.   In a large, decentralized organization such as a modern research university, no one person holds the keys to the organization. No powerful Dean, No Board Chair, no renowned professor, no enthusiastic AMS president, and certainly no President holds the keys on their own. The truth is that we all hold the keys - in trust - to preserve, strengthen and ultimately to leave the institution to the next generation a better place than it was left to us. The secret ingredient is our collective effort, an alignment within the organization; everyone rowing in the same direction.   And the good news is, I know that we can do it. The good news is that the secret ingredient already exists. It is most fundamentally embodied by our collective love for UBC.  By coming together and embracing the diversity within the organization, by working to make our community a truly inclusive organization, by respecting the voices of our faculty, staff and students we will become an even more remarkable institution.   UBC. You have honoured me greatly by calling upon me to serve as your President. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for bringing this Vancouver born boy back home. Working together let's really move this university, our collective home, from Excellence to Eminence.  Let's set the stage to make UBC’s second century even more magical than its first. UBC has done it in its first century. We can, We will, do it again. Ladies and Gentlemen. Tuum Est! It's up to us.                                         
1.0357434~UBC’s second century : Moving from excellence to eminence~Ono, Santa Jeremy~ UBC’s second century: Moving from excellence to eminence  The Canadian Club, Vancouver January 11, 2017, 11:45 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.  Notes for Santa J. Ono President and Vice-Chancellor University of British Columbia     Venue: Terminal City Club, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC  Host: Raymond Greenwood, President of the Canadian Club (you will be introduced by Joyce Murray, MP for Vancouver-Quadra)  Audience: current and former members of the Vancouver business community   Background: this is the first speech in 2017 for the club, which has monthly speaking engagement. The theme for 2017 for the club is Canada’s 150th birthday.   Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 2 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono   Thank you to Joyce Murray for that warm introduction, and thank you all. I am honoured to be here today, to deliver the first address to the Canadian Club during this, the country’s sesquicentennial. Before I begin, I would like to thank the law firm, Farris, for sponsoring this event. I also want to thank you all for sharing your time, and to extend a special welcome to today’s special guests; Joyce Murray, Michael Korbin, Jean-Christophe Fleury, Diana Lam, Jonathan Weisman, Peter Jackman and Barbara Grantham.  As I’ve said already, it’s my honour to speak to you today, particularly because this is the Canadian Club’s first event in our country’s 150th year. Birthdays always present a wonderful opportunity: for celebration, for reflection – perhaps for reconciliation – and, absolutely, for preparation.  In any moment of reflection, it’s undeniable that Canada has much to celebrate. Think of where we are – and of how far we have come.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 3 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono This “New World” – including the ancestral and unceded territory of the Coast Salish people on which we gather today – is not, in any literal way, new. The trees, the rocks, the spectacular views are well aged in geological time.   It’s Canada that is new, certainly so in a geopolitical context – compared to the Commonwealth of England, or the empires of Russia and Spain, Rome and Greece, the dynasties of India and China. Even here, Coast Salish society dates back 10,000 years or more.  But, it was only 150 years ago that this country’s founders committed themselves to an act of hope and promise. Canada, then, was the legal expression of an argument that we could achieve more as a federation, working together, than we could as individual jurisdictions, squabbling amongst one another.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 4 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono Given Canada’s place in the world today, it’s clear that the founders were on to something important. This experiment in peace, order and good government has been an incredible success.  Our democracy is among the world’s most stable. News reports says Canada is tops this year among the best places to visit. We have three cities on the list of the world’s most reputable. And Canada, as a whole, is eighth among countries judged to be the most livable.  (That is measured by a combination of the UN Human Development Index, Gross National Income per capita, life expectancy at birth and – here’s one I think particularly important – expected years of schooling.)  We stand sixth on the World Happiness Index.  All those accolades notwithstanding, we remain modestly Canadian in acknowledging our bounty. I see this quite clearly having spent so many years in the United States. But even if Canadians are slow to boast, I think we still Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 5 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono understand that Canada is a most spectacular gift. Our doorstep is crowded with people who would give anything to be able to call themselves – Canadian.  Which brings me to what I would propose today as my central question: Having received this gift, what can we make of it?  This country – this Canada – is not some vast, physical jackpot to be spent recklessly, or exploited indiscriminately. It is an inheritance. It is a foundation on which we have a duty to build; we are honour bound to consume no more than the interest and to leave behind capital that is stronger, safer, more prosperous and sustainable than it was when it came into our hands. And that’s not just a goal, but a responsibility – for every individual and every institution in this great nation. It will be our challenge this year, and for all the years to come.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 6 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono As I suspect you know, this period of national celebration and reflection comes hard on the heels of a similar occasion at UBC. We have just marked our centenary and we celebrate a similar embarrassment of riches.  Just as Canada’s lifespan is short in a global context, UBC is a tender adolescent among great institutions like Oxford and Harvard. And yet, on the strength of the brilliance and effort of a century of scholars – and thanks to the sagacity of governments that have invested, well, in post-secondary education and world-class research – UBC now stands among the best three dozen such institutions in the world. We’re in the top 20 if you count public universities alone.    Our faculty includes pre-eminent scholars and researchers, members of the great academic societies and winners of the Nobel Prize. And our 317,000 graduates excel in practically every field of human endeavor: three, including the incumbent, Justin Trudeau, have been Prime Ministers of Canada; 65 have won Olympic medals.   Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 7 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono The University, which now spans two magnificent campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, is renowned as a global research centre. Leveraging more than $600 million in annual funding, UBC clinicians and scientists are leading in everything from the effort to eradicate AIDS to combatting the tragedy of fentanyl addiction.  Our work in sustainability is at the very forefront – even the notion of an environmental footprint was conceived at UBC by Bill Rees and Mathis Wackernagel. And our scholarship in the humanities and social sciences and in the liberal and performing arts is stunning in its breadth and depth.   That is the happy reality of my own inheritance. Ignore, for a moment, the nostalgic connection – that my father taught at UBC and I was born in this beautiful city. Forget, if you can, all the other reasons that would attract a person of good judgment to Vancouver. I came here because I am inspired by UBC’s accomplishments and its potential.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 8 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono And there, again, is the important word – potential – which invokes, again, my central question: Having received this gift, what can we make of it? What, for example, is UBC’s responsibility to Canada – and to the world?  My own ambition, which I put on the record in my installation speech in November, is to do all that I can to help UBC move from excellence to eminence.  I invoke the word “eminence,” reflecting two possible definitions. The Oxford Canadian Dictionary defines eminence as: “Fame or acknowledged superiority within a particular sphere.”   To the first part, I make no excuses for chasing after “fame” – which I would define as fair recognition for UBC’s accomplishments and capacities. Because I don’t think most people have any idea how great an institution UBC is today. And if people don’t know, there is a danger that we will not take appropriate advantage of how much good the university can do tomorrow.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 9 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono As to the second definition of eminence – the notion of superiority – I regard it as my duty to help UBC become even better. Because if the people of UBC are empowered to do their best, they will redefine what “best” means in the world. To strive for less would be to waste an opportunity.  So, how do we achieve this level of performance? Well, it’s clear enough that I cannot do it alone. In a large, decentralized organization – a university or a country – no individual holds the keys to success. No politician, no leader – in business or academia – no independent innovator, no matter how brilliant. The necessary ingredient is our collective effort – everyone working their hardest to do what they, and only they, can do best.  Within UBC, I would argue that we also need a sense of common purpose – to which end, I have launched a strategic planning process. It is early days yet, but there are common themes emerging. I’d like to share five.  They are: • Teaching; Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 10 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono • Research and scholarship; • Student experience; • International engagement; and   • Innovation.  Some of these may seem obvious, but it’s often the obvious things that, in the flurry of the day-to-day, we begin to overlook.  So, let us begin with teaching. It’s really, the whole educational interaction that is teaching and learning, and it is essential. At UBC, we do not regard education as a commodity or a simple path to a credential. It is the transformation that empowers our students to think critically and creatively.  UBC is already a global leader in teaching innovation. Consider Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman’s Science Education Initiative: It’s a multi-year project aimed at improving undergraduate science education, and it has already Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 11 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono produced new techniques and strategies that are being emulated in other countries and by other great universities, including Stanford.   Coming back to the question of reconciliation, we also want to ensure that the education we offer is responsive to every student, which begins with an unflinching look at where our system has failed in the past – at UBC and elsewhere in society.  UBC’s Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at UBC is a major commitment towards this goal. And our Aboriginal Admissions program suggests that our performance has been improving. In 2001, we set a target of graduating 50 First Nations doctors by 2020 – and we hit that milestone, five years early, in 2015.  Our second theme, research and scholarship, is equally essential. This, too, is a theme you’ll see on the short list of imperatives at every good research institution. But one of the ways we have chosen to distinguish UBC is to urge our researchers to embrace the grand challenges that face humanity: Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 12 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono clean water, sustainable and renewable energy, chronic diseases and global food availability. We don’t just want to be a great university; we want be a great university that does good.  Consider, for example, the work of William Cheung, director of science at the Nippon Foundation-UBC Nereus Program and associate professor at the UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries. Researching the impacts of climate change, Dr. Cheung reported recently that capping the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 degrees could increase the ocean’s capacity to produce food fish by an annual average of six million metric tonnes.  The third theme, student experience, speaks to a fundamental responsibility – to taxpayers as well as to students. It also reflects the fiercely competitive space in which great institutions like UBC must operate.  In terms of the former, there was a time when big universities thought it acceptable to push students in at the deep end – and to let them flourish or fail as the current took them. No longer. We are now invested in the success of Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 13 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono every student – for their own sake and to ensure that the support that we receive from government is well spent. Society is investing in tomorrow’s capacity; and we are committed to safeguarding that investment.   This means providing students with a safe and supportive experience in their academic and extra-curricular lives. Academically, this crosses over with teaching, as we innovate in the classroom and expand options such as experiential learning – everything from work-integrated learning or co-ops, to research experiences and study abroad. Our data clearly show a correlation between student satisfaction and experiential learning.  Student experience, broadly, is also enriched by the participation of the best students; that’s why the competition to attract great students is so fierce. Take the example of Ann Makosinski, a 19-year-old from Victoria who, in high school, invented a flashlight that runs off the heat of the human hand and a mug that uses heat from the drink to charge a cell phone. Makosinski, who has just been named to the Forbes magazine list of the top 30 under 30, was choosing – among other institutions – between UBC and Stanford. As she Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 14 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono works through her second year, we’re delighted that Stanford missed the pick, because Makosinki sets a fantastic example for her fellow UBC students.  I characterized our fourth theme as international engagement, but it could just as easily be community engagement – for UBC has never been more open or integrative in how it works, teaches, researches and interacts with its various communities. But UBC also has a unique opportunity in Canada to connect our cities, our province and our nation to the great educational institutions around the world – especially in Asia.    We are already investing toward this end. Our Liu Institute for Global Issues is a major interdisciplinary centre focused on solving issues such as sustainability, social justice, conflict resolution and global warming.  We have 33 student mobility agreements with universities around the world; we have strategic links and research partnerships in myriad faculties and disciplines, with leading scholars in Asia, Europe and the U.S.; and our Asian Library houses the largest research collection in Asian languages in Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 15 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono North America. As well, 23% of UBC Vancouver and 13% of UBC Okanagan students are international, which enriches the experience for all of our students today and engenders international networks and connections for tomorrow.  A final theme, and one that dovetails nicely with federal and provincial priorities, is that of innovation. UBC was recognized in the last Reuters survey as Canada’s most innovative university, ranking among the top 50 most innovative universities globally. But we aspire to do even better.  There are myriad examples in this category that you might have heard before: the Vancouver biotech revolution leveraged off the work of Dr. Julia Levy; the advances in prostate cancer treatment; clean energy spin-offs, as  through Westport Technologies; Brett Finlay’s work in e.coli – in fact, all of the life science innovation that has come out of the lab of the late Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Smith.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 16 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono There are also the hands-on innovations in forestry, mining and the petrochemical industries that have made UBC’s engineers so critical to the success in B.C.’s traditional resource economy.   But we are always looking to do more – always looking for the next big thing. And it’s in the nature of innovation that you can’t predict the next breakthrough – or even the implications of the most recent discovery.  For example, I am charmed by a recent piece of research in which UBC zoologist Prov. Douglas Altshuler discovered that hummingbirds detect motion in a completely unique way. While every other animal is wired to pay most attention to images coming from behind them, hummingbirds entertain visual signals from all directions equally. I don’t know what the implication of this discovery might be, but it could prove crucial in an age when drones and self-driving cars have made 360-degree vision more important than ever.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 17 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono So, we are attentive to fundamental research and determined to expand our capacity as a catalyst for new technologies and spin off companies, in Vancouver and Kelowna.  We are working with the provincial government to implement its BCTECH Strategy, and the federal government on its Innovation Agenda, to strengthen the innovation pipeline – from basic research all the way to commercialization.  For example, as Western Canada’s largest technology research cluster, UBC has combined the efforts of the Institute for Computing, Information, and Cognitive Systems with the Faculties of Applied Science, Science, Sauder School of Business, entrepreneurship@UBC, and the University-Industry Liaison Office, to establish a new UBC technology incubator: HATCH. I’m certain you will hear more from HATCH, soon and ongoing.   Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 18 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono Finally, and this captures themes of research and innovation, I have just established a President’s Excellence Fund directed to six areas where UBC has exemplary capacity: cancer genomics, forest bioproducts, biodiversity, media studies, global development policy and brain health. The fund will allow us to expand the scope of our research and recruit top talent into research chairs in each of these areas.  These five themes, this nascent strategic vision, is dedicated, once again, to our central purpose: to take something that is very good and make it better – to move from excellence to eminence.  We do that in concert with our governments, and we do it on behalf of the people of Canada, and the world – today and tomorrow.  Once again, as we celebrate 150 years of confederation – as we look fondly at what we have done well and unflinchingly at what we could and should do better – let us remember: ours is a gift that we dare not waste.  Canadian Club Vancouver   January 11, 2017 19 Notes for UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa J. Ono Thank you.    
1.0357438~Universities and the "Innovation Economy"~Ono, Santa Jeremy~1  Universities and the “Innovation Economy” A talk for the Kelowna Chamber of Commerce, 28 October 2016  Thank you very much.  It’s a real honour to be invited to speak to you today, here in the heart of the beautiful south Okanagan.    This is not my first visit to Kelowna; since taking on the presidency of UBC, I’ve come at least half-a-dozen times, for meetings of one kind or another; most memorably, perhaps, during the Royal visit to UBC’s north Kelowna campus.  And each time I’ve come here, I’ve been more and more impressed: by the kindness and 2  generosity of the people I’ve met here;  by the beauty of this part of beautiful BC; and by all the signs of a flourishing local economy that’s expanding to meet the needs and aspirations of a growing population.  Historically, the south Okanagan has depended for its prosperity on agriculture, especially fruit growing and wine production.  Tourism is having an increasing impact, as the Okanagan brings in thousands of people every year from all 3  over the world; and most recently, we’ve seen growth in real estate, with a steady influx of new residents attracted by all the amenities of the region.  But there are signs of other kinds of growth too.  According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Kelowna is the most entrepreneurial city in the country—that is, the best place to start and grow a business.  To achieve this kind of status, you must have the right kind of 4  infrastructure in place, and according to the Federation, Kelowna is in that position.    Let me quote from the Kelowna Daily Courier, which reported this story just a couple of weeks ago.  The writer cites the opinion of the manager of the Central Okanagan Economic Development Commission, who lists the components of Kelowna’s economic infrastructure, including “the highly skilled Kelowna workforce, UBC Okanagan, Okanagan College, air access through Kelowna’s 5  airport, a welcoming business community and a quality of life that attracts entrepreneurs, workers, students, families and retirees alike.”  The article goes on to point out something potentially even more significant: the city’s growing capacity in connectivity, which provides “massive internet capabilities for businesses that need it.”   “That connectivity,” says the article, “has helped the Okanagan become home to more than 750 high-tech firms that 6  have created a $1.3-billion-a-year sector employing more than 7500.”  Connectivity, high-tech, and a highly-skilled work-force: this is the future, and it’s already here in Kelowna.    These are the key elements in any plan to develop the prosperity and wellbeing of our population locally, regionally, and nationally.  And to derive the maximum amount of advantage from them, we need to think out of the box: we need to bring 7  new ways of thinking into the equation, to draw on the capacity for innovation that marks every successful enterprise—whether it’s in business, in technology, in medical research, or in the arts.   The business I’m in is education: and the spirit of innovation is very much at the heart of what we are trying to do in our schools, colleges, and universities today.  Let me speak for a little about innovation in the classroom.  At the level of undergraduate education, things are very 8  different from what they were a decade or two ago, and innovation has transformed the nature of teaching and learning.  The era of the “sage on the stage” has passed, and students have progressed far beyond the passive recipients of information they were in the old days.  Today professors tend to be facilitators, creating the right environments for students to acquire information in a variety of dynamic ways.  Courses in many areas, such as law, medicine, and engineering, are 9  often case-based or problem-based, requiring students to work collaboratively in teams to find solutions—and preparing them for the way problems are tackled in the working world beyond university.    Many of our instructors use the flipped-classroom approach: students essentially learn the materials outside the classroom, then come to class to apply what they’ve learned to questions and problems presented to the group.  10  Instructors of traditionally large classes now can determine exactly what their students know at any given moment in a class simply by inviting students to provide immediate electronic responses to questions, making it possible to measure the degree of understanding (or misunderstanding) among participants in the class.   At UBC we are responding to pressures for change by introducing new courses to prepare students for work in fields that 11  barely existed a decade ago.  A student in Arts can now take a program in Cognitive Systems, in which the participating units are Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, and Computer Science.  Through the interrelated study of these fields, the student gains a comprehensive understanding of human cognition, and learns to apply this knowledge to create intelligent artificial systems.  A student in applied Science can twin her studies in hydraulic engineering with a program in entrepreneurship, so that she is prepared 12  for the challenges of commercializing and monetizing her skills.   And then of course there’s the whole area of information technology. The huge expansion of digital tools has revolutionized the business of teaching and learning. Many courses now take a blended approach, mixing face-to-face presentations with online or video presentations.  Students now have instantaneous access to vast electronic databases, and require a 13  sophisticated understanding of software tools to access and use that information.  So you can see that innovation lies at the very heart of what we do to prepare our students for the world beyond our gates.  And it’s in this same spirit that universities are gearing up to meet the social and economic challenges that face our society today.  Canada, despite its great natural wealth and its industrial expertise, is falling behind in terms of the productivity, 14  competitiveness, and trained workforce we need to stay abreast of the competition.  In global terms, we’re in a period of economic stagnation; and the key to regaining our position as a leader in world trade is to innovate: to find new products, new methods of production, new markets for our goods.    To respond to this challenge, the federal government has recently launched two important initiatives: a fundamental science review and a consultation on Canada’s 15  innovation agenda. Combined, these two initiatives aim to address how best to foster an innovation-based economy in the 21st Century. In doing so, they are asking important questions about the globally competitive levels of research funding, best practices for “big science”, and whether or not Canadian innovators and researchers have the right kinds of support to achieve their goals.   Our province is responding in similar fashion. The BC government is just as 16  concerned to find ways of giving our economy a jump-start.    Since 1998 the province has provided important matching dollars through its Knowledge Development Fund to ensure universities attract Canada Foundation for Innovation funding for research infrastructure. Through this and other provincial programs such as Genome BC and the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, UBC and our sister institutions in BC have been able to build 17  the kind of solid foundation that makes advanced research possible and encourages innovation.  The province has created its own blueprint for innovation, in the form of the BC Tech Strategy announced earlier this year.  Through grants and other financial incentives to employers and educational institutions, the government hopes to stimulate applied research, create a highly-skilled workforce, and encourage job growth.  This is an important 18  acknowledgement of the role the tech sector is playing in our provincial economy as a complement to the resource sector; BC is coming to terms with the reality that our economy is increasingly dependent on science and technology, and so is investing heavily in research and innovation.  And as I hope you know, UBC itself is a major player in the research enterprise. We are the second largest research institution in Canada. In the past year we have attracted $600 million in research funding, 19  supporting almost 9,000 research projects across the university.  We conduct 90% of the industry-sponsored research in BC.  In 2016, UBC was in the 92nd percentile for start-up company creation among North American universities, and in the 97th percentile among Canadian universities. So you can see, UBC is a significant participant in the research strategies promoted by our regional and national governments.  Let me tell you about some of the ways in which UBC is contributing to the 20  innovation agenda.  One of the most important is through our commitment to the development of research clusters.  These are interdepartmental networks of leaders in particular fields who are brought together to investigate large problems that resist individual solutions, but are opening up their secrets in the face of collaborative research.    So we have a biodiversity group comprising members of our botany and zoology departments working together on 21  “Adapting Biosystems,” figuring out the processes by which evolution affects different species in different ways.  Another cluster has been formed by bringing together researchers from the Faculty of Forestry, Botany, the Michael Smith Laboratories, Biodiversity, and the Faculty of Land and Food Systems: they have formed a forestry and plant productivity group studying plant genomics and bio-products from renewable resources.  22  A third cluster that has brought scholars from a variety of fields together is one with the title “Remembering and Commemorating Trauma.”  Taking its cue from the work of the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Committee, scholars in this interdisciplinary group are interested in the impact of traumatic events on the individual, on society, and on marginalized groups within society.  It’s made up of researchers from History, Social Work, Creative Writing, Critical Studies, Psychology, Indigenous Studies, and 23  Philosophy.  An important aspect of this research is its examination of the ways in which our responses to trauma can be used to heal, reconcile, and empower.  As the last example illustrates, such clusters encourage scholars to break through disciplinary barriers and engage with one another in innovative ways, leading to both knowledge creation and knowledge translation—that is, the application of new discoveries for the health and wellbeing of society. 24  From this, I hope it’s clear that our commitment to innovation does not stop at our gates.  As a major research university, one of the top 40 in the world, UBC supplies both the technical know-how and the qualified graduates to keep our industries at the forefront of world markets.  We contribute to the development and evolution of new companies, products, and services, and create the new technologies that industry needs to remain productive and competitive. UBC students have the benefit of the largest co-op education 25  program in Western Canada, gaining invaluable work experience before they graduate, and facilitating the exchange of knowledge between industry and academia.    To further promote research-industry collaborations, UBC’s University-Industry Liaison Office—the UILO—helps start-ups and spin-offs, and provides the kind of network and know-how that enables researchers to bring their discoveries into the marketplace. UILO is comprised of two distinct groups: the Sponsored Research 26  Group and the Technology Transfer Group. Both groups are recognized nationally, negotiating more than 2,500 contracts, issuing hundreds of patents and licensing agreements, and spinning off new companies each year.     One of UBC’s most successful spin-offs is Westport Innovations, BC's largest clean tech company. The company engineers the world's most advanced natural gas engines and vehicles, reducing emissions and fuel costs, employing more than 450 people in 27  BC and over 1,000 in Canada, all with technology developed at UBC. The company was initially built through close partnerships with UBC researchers, grad students and lab facilities, and maintains extensive research partnerships with UBC to this day.  Collaboration of this kind, between university research and industrial application, is becoming more and more significant, and it is this kind of collaboration that really defines what we’re calling the “innovation economy.”  28  Let me give you an example from close to home: UBC Okanagan has begun to develop a 30-acre Innovation Precinct to accommodate productive long-term engagement with industry and non-profits.  This will bring together industrial partners who want to draw on our research excellence to develop and test new products.  Earlier this year UBC Okanagan signed an agreement with Avcorp Industries from Delta BC, a leading supplier of integrated composite and metallic aerostructures.  The agreement is to 29  develop a “Learning Factory  for Advanced Composites,” which will integrate industrial production with learning and research, drawing on the expertise of our faculty and giving our students hands-on experiential learning.    I know that a number of people here today have been involved with this venture in one capacity or another, and are keen to see it succeed.  Indeed, this kind of partnership holds great promise, not only for the university and industrial partners, 30  but also for the economy of the region, since such arrangements have a ripple effect, bringing training for students, creating manufacturing jobs in the private sector, and offering the promise of new industries and a diversified economic base in the Okanagan.    There’s an added dimension to growing the innovation economy in southern BC through university research.  I recently had the pleasure of participating in a conference with the president of the University of 31  Washington, at which we explored the possibility of creating a “tech corridor” in the Pacific Northwest.  The “Cascadia Corridor” would bring together some of the finest minds on the continent to create the kind of synergy you find in Boston or the Silicon Valley.    In conjunction with the University of Washington, we’re exploring ways of creating an innovation hub that would see the great universities of the Pacific Northwest collaborate with each other and 32  tech giants like Microsoft and Google, in the development of new tools and applications that would transform the economies of the region.  And since that conference, UBC has been taking a fresh look at areas like biomedical engineering and digital media, with a view to optimizing our research capabilities through joint projects.  So the future holds great promise—that is, if we make the kinds of investment that will pay large dividends: investments in interdisciplinary learning and research; in 33  cross-border collaboration; in incubators and start-ups; in research clusters that combine complementary strengths in a variety of fields; and in partnerships between universities, governments, and industry.  But perhaps the most important investment we can make to ensure the success of an innovation-based economy is in the development of human capital: the education of a highly-skilled, flexible, and creative population.  It’s a cliché, perhaps, 34  but the wealth of a nation lies in the capabilities and resourcefulness of its people; and the key to tapping those capabilities, that resourcefulness, lies in education.  Great universities like UBC nurture and stimulate the capabilities, imagination, and leadership qualities that are the foundation of a society’s prosperity.    I’m speaking now not only about economic prosperity, but social prosperity too.  We need to develop new ideas, not just in science and technology, not just in 35  industrial production, but in meeting the social challenges that still lie before us.  We need to find ways to bring First Nations fully into the circle of economic prosperity, and to realize the potential in First Nations youth.  We need to break the cycle of poverty and ill-health in our big cities, and to solve the seemingly intractable problems like drug use and homelessness.  Innovation is needed here too—big ideas, original thinking, a rejection of the status quo.    36  Such challenges demand innovative thinking by every sector of society, working together for the common good.  UBC is doing its part there too; but that’s a subject for another day!  Thank you.     
1.0357410~Meeting challenges through innovation~Ono, Santa Jeremy~	 1	Meeting	challenges	through	innovation	Santa	J.	Ono	March	12,	2017			Premier	Christy	Clark	asked	me	to	become	her	chief	advisor	of	the	British	Columbia	Innovation	Network	earlier	this	year.	Of	course,	I	said	yes.	But,	what	is	an	Innovation	Network?	Better	yet,	what	does	innovation	even	mean?		We	are	bombarded	with	that	word,	innovation.	We	invoke	this	buzz-term	so	often,	we	risk	stripping	it	of	any	real	substance.	But,	it	still	has	meaning	to	me.	In	fact,	I	have	thought	a	lot	about	innovation,	what	it	means	to	BC,	and	how	by	working	together	we	can	help	push	the	provincial	economy	to	new	heights.		So,	what	is	innovation?	Joseph	Schumpeter	argued	that	innovation	is	a	process	of	“creative	destruction,”	when	new	technologies	replace	old	ones.			When	the	OECD	ranks	countries	on	their	innovation	performance,	they	define	it	as	“the	implementation	of	a	new	or	significantly	improved	product	(good	or	service)	or	process,	a	new	marketing	method,	or	a	new	organizational	method	in	business	practices,	workplace	organization	or	external	relations.”			To	me,	innovation	is	a	never-ending	exchange	between	the	realities	of	today	and	the	potential	of	tomorrow.	Today,	we	are	confronted	with	the	enormous	challenge	of	a	changing	climate,	we	witness	friends	and	loved	ones	battle	cancer,	and	we	struggle	to	develop	policies	and	facilities	for	our	seniors.	Tomorrow	holds	the	promise	of	a	sustainable,	resilient	global	economy,	reduced	or	eliminated	cancer-related	mortality,	and	an	aging	population	living	independently	and	actively	engaged	in	society.			Innovation	lies	between	the	challenges	of	today	and	the	dreams	we	have	for	tomorrow.		I	know	that	British	Columbians	are	incredible	innovators.	An	app	that	finds	new	uses	for	surplus	food;	imaging	technologies	for	the	inside	of	oil	and	gas	wells;	personalized	cancer	treatments;	quantum	leaps	in	computing	power—these	are	just	a	few	examples	of	new	products	and	methods	devised	in	BC.			The	technology	sector	is	one	area	of	the	economy	you	can	readily	find	innovation—new	mobile	apps,	virtual	and	augmented	reality	technologies	and	applications,	the	internet	of	things,	fuel		 2	cells,	and	the	list	goes	on.	In	this	sector	alone,	nearly	10,000	companies	employ	more	than	100,000	people.			But	you	can	find	great	innovation	in	every	sector	of	our	economy	and	in	every	region	in	the	province,	whether	in	agriculture,	health	and	life	sciences,	natural	resources,	education,	tourism,	transportation,	or	the	film	industry.		As	president	of	UBC,	it	shouldn’t	come	as	a	surprise	that	I	think	talent	and	research	are	critical	drivers	of	innovation.	BC-based	researchers	are	tackling	society’s	grand	challenges	and	unlocking	some	of	the	greatest	mysteries	of	the	universe.	And	BC	universities,	colleges	and	polytechnics	attract	the	brightest	students	from	across	the	province	and	from	the	furthest	reaches	of	Canada	and	the	world.			To	be	sure,	BC	benefits	from	remarkable	post-secondary	institutions.	But	post-secondary	institutions	are	not	the	sole	drivers	of	innovation,	nor	the	sole	source	of	talent.			A	BC	Innovation	Network	includes	all	of	us:	the	berry	farmer	considering	new	planting	methods,	the	programmer	figuring	out	how	to	immerse	a	gamer	in	intergalactic	travel,	the	teacher	using	new	learning	tools	in	the	classroom,	or	the	genomics	researcher	at	the	lab	bench.			With	closer	ties	and	a	shared	purpose,	we	can	work	more	effectively	to	promote	stronger	links	between	the	BC	companies	and	organizations	that	depend	on	the	availability	of	talented	people,	and	the	colleges,	polytechnic	institutes	and	universities	responsible	for	training	and	educating	our	students.	We	can	build	clusters	of	expertise	across	this	network	focused	on	building	competitive	advantages	in	specific	research	and	industry	sectors,	and	around	tackling	difficult	societal	problems	facing	BC	and	communities	around	the	world.	These,	to	me,	are	the	key	parts	of	a	BC	Innovation	Network.		As	I	embark	on	my	role	as	the	premier’s	chief	advisor	of	the	BC	Innovation	Network	at	this	year’s	#BCTECH	Summit,	I	look	forward	to	hearing	from	fellow	British	Columbians.	What	I	hope	to	achieve	is	a	shared	commitment	to	learning	and	research,	collaboration,	research	clusters	that	combine	complementary	strengths	in	a	variety	of	fields,	and	partnerships	between	post-secondary	institutions,	governments	and	industry.		Professor	Santa	J.	Ono	is	the	president	and	vice-chancellor	of	the	University	of	British	Columbia	and	the	chief	advisor	of	the	British	Columbia	Innovation	Network.		
1.0357436~Speech to the Vancouver Board of Trade~Ono, Santa Jeremy~Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	1	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	Speech	to	the	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	March	28,	2017,	11:30	a.m.	Four	Seasons	Hotel,	Vancouver	Santa	J.	Ono		 	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	2	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	Good	afternoon	and	thank	you	everyone.	It’s	an	honour	to	be	with	you	today.	I’d	like	to	begin	by	acknowledging	that	we	are	gathered	on	the	the	traditional,	ancestral,	and	unceded	territory	of	the	Coast	Salish	people,	the	Musqueam,	the	Squamish	and	the	Tsleil	Waututh.	I	would	also	like	to	acknowledge	and	thank	our	sponsors,	the	Sauder	School	of	Business,	the	Robert	H.	Lee	Graduate	School	of	Business	and	Boyden.	I	am	delighted	and	honoured	by	the	opportunity	to	speak	to	the	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	for	the	first	time	as	president	of	UBC.	It	is	a	long-standing	tradition	for	UBC	presidents	to	address	the	board	of	trade	and	many	in	the	room	today	will	have	heard	my	esteemed	predecessors	address	the	Board	of	Trade.	It	is	my	pleasure	to	stand	here	today	to	continue	that	tradition.	There	is	so	much	opportunity	–	at	UBC,	in	Vancouver,	in	B.C.	and	in	Canada.	And	given	our	collective	capacity	and	influence,	there	is	so	much	that	we	can	do,	together,	that	will	produce	benefits	for	our	province	and	country.	I’d	like	talk	about	two	things	today.	First,	I’d	like	to	introduce	myself	and	tell	you	about	why	I	came	to	UBC	–	not	because	I	like	talking	about	myself	but	because	I	think	the	reasons	why	I	decided	to	come	to	UBC	tell	a	story	about	where	UBC	is	headed	–	what	it	has	to	offer	today	and	what	I	am	confident	it	will	become.	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	3	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono		Second,	and	this	is	closely	related,	I’d	like	to	talk	about	innovation.	This	is	a	hugely	important	component	of	my	job	as	UBC	President.	But	it	also	comes	as	part	of	a	mandate	from	Premier	Christy	Clark,	who	has	asked	me	to	serve	as	chief	advisor	on	the	new	BC	Innovation	Network.	Again,	this	points	to	the	opportunities	and,	I	think,	responsibilities	that	we	all	have	to	work	together	to	help	B.C.	achieve	its	potential.	But	first:	why	did	I	come	to	Vancouver?	Well,	you	need	only	look	at	the	real	estate	prices	to	understand	that	a	lot	of	people	want	to	come	here.	It’s	a	spectacular	city.	Although	I	have	some	serious	questions	about	Vancouver’s	reputation.	For	example,	when	I	was	thinking	about	coming,	I	was	told	that	Vancouver	is	warm	–	and	that	Vancouverites	are	not.	People	said	I	would	enjoy	the	no-snow	winters,	but	that,	as	a	U.S.	transplant,	I	might	find	that	Vancouverites	have	a	sort	of	British	reserve	that	can	make	them	seem	chilly.	This	is	all	wrong.	I	don’t	think	we	have	to	talk	about	the	rumor	of	warm	weather.	I’d	really	rather	not.	Enough	to	say	that	I	had	the	wrong	wardrobe	for	winter	2017.	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	4	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono		But	when	it	comes	to	the	warmth	of	Vancouver’s	people,	I	have	been	overwhelmed.	I	have	been	blown	away	by	how	warmly	the	Vancouver	community	has	reached	out	to	me,	and	I	am	incredibly	grateful.	Vancouver	is	also	welcoming	in	another,	extremely	important	way.	You	may	know	that	I	was	born	here,	in	1962.	My	family	had	moved	from	Japan	to	the	United	States	in	1959,	and	when	my	father’s	U.S.	Green	Card	timed	out,	Canada	opened	its	doors.	Vancouver	provided	a	safe	and	welcoming	home	at	a	critical	time.	It	turned	out	that	other	opportunities	drew	my	father	back	to	the	States.	After	teaching	for	a	year	in	the	math	department	at	UBC,	he	moved	to	the	University	of	Pennsylvania	and,	ultimately,	to	Johns	Hopkins	in	Baltimore.	That’s	where	I	grew	up.	But	Canada’s	openness	is,	once	again,	not	just	a	matter	of	pride	but	a	competitive	advantage.	That	became	obvious	to	me	on	November	9th,	when,	in	the	aftermath	of	the	US	election,	so	many	Americans	enquired	about	coming	to	Canada.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	5	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	The	phenomenon	grew	even	more	in	January,	when	the	Trump	Administration	introduced	its	first	attempt	to	ban	travelers	from	seven	majority	Muslim	countries.	I	got	a	surprising	number	of	direct	emails,	not	just	from	people	I	knew	in	the	U.S.,	but	from	others	who	were	afraid	that,	if	blocked	from	entering	the	United	States,	they	would	not	be	able	to	finish	their	education.	This	is	real.	Our	applications	from	international	students	have	risen	by	25	percent	this	year.	They’re	coming	from	people	who	might	previously	have	preferred	to	study	in	the	U.K.,	but	are	worried	about	England	distancing	itself	from	the	European	Union.	They’re	coming	from	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	who	are	feeling	uncomfortable,	or	unsafe,	in	the	United	States.	And	the	applications	are	not	limited	to	students.	We’ve	also	seen	a	steady	increase	in	the	number	of	inquiries	from	top	notch	post-docs	and	would-be	UBC	faculty.	You	may	have	heard,	too,	how	prominent	this	was	as	a	topic	of	conversation	at	the	recent	BC	Tech	Summit.	Aside	from	increasing	our	ability	to	compete	for	great	talent	at	UBC,	there	is	also	a	potential	to	open	new	high-tech	operations	in	Vancouver	or	to	expand	existing	offices,	because	we	can	welcome	and	embrace	top	talent	from	around	the	world.	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	6	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	As	I	say,	this	is	a	competitive	advantage	and	one	that	could	have	lasting	impact.	That	said;	I,	personally,	didn’t	come	to	Vancouver	because	I	felt	insecure	or	unhappy	in	the	U.S.	The	University	of	Cincinnati,	where	I	was	president,	is	a	fantastic	institution.		But	UBC	is	something	else.	Where	UCincinnati	is	ranked	among	the	top	300-or-so	universities	in	the	world,	UBC	is	in	the	top	three	dozen.	If	you	look	only	at	public	universities	–	which	is	a	fairer	comparison	–	UBC	is	in	the	top	25.	That’s	not	a	vain	boast.	It’s	an	actual	measurement	of	how	well	this	institution	compares	when	it	comes	to	things	like	innovative	capacity.	It’s	what	prospective	students,	faculty	–	and	philanthropic	supporters	–	look	at	when	they	are	trying	to	choose	a	university.	It’s	important.	That’s	not	to	imply	that	UBC	chases	rankings.	Rather,	we	concentrate	on	excellence.	Then,	as	the	impact	of	our	research	reverberates,	locally	and	globally,	and	as	300,000	UBC	alumni	make	their	influence	felt	around	the	world,	UBC’s	reputation	improves	yet	further	–	and	with	that,	we	increase	our	capacity	to	do	even	more.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	7	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	So,	even	aside	from	the	temptation	of	returning	to	this	beautiful	city,	the	opportunity	at	UBC	was	such	that	I	just	couldn’t	resist.	And	now,	here	I	stand	as	the	15th	president	of	the	University	of	British	Columbia.	It’s	an	interesting	role.	Being	a	university	president	is	a	little	like	being	an	orchestra	conductor.	You	get	to	stand	at	the	front.	You	get	to	wear	the	bowtie.	But	no	amount	of	arm-waving	will	call	forth	success	if	you	don’t	have	a	brilliant	ensemble	that	is	working	well	–	together.	UBC’s	orchestra	–	to	continue	the	metaphor	–	is	comprised	of	brilliant	faculty	members,	students,	staff	and	alumni.		The	graduates	of	UBC	excel	in	practically	every	field	of	human	endeavor.	Three	graduates	have	served	as	Prime	Minister	of	Canada	-	including	the	incumbent	Justin	Trudeau.	Seven	members	of	the	UBC	faculty	have	won	the	Nobel	prize.	Well	over	200	current	members	of	the	faculty	are	members	of	academies	such	as	the	Royal	Society,	Royal	Society	of	Canada,	the	US	National	Academies	and	the	American	Academy	of	Arts	&	Sciences.	70	graduates	have	been	awarded	the	Rhodes	Scholarship	and	65	graduates	have	won	an	Olympic	medal.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	8	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	A	significant	amount	of	credit	for	the	quality	of	the	UBC	ensemble	must	go	to	my	predecessors.	I	live	today	in	a	house	named	for	the	remarkable	Norman	Mackenzie,	who	was	the	UBC	president	when	my	father	taught	here	in	the	1960s.	I	have	to	say,	for	a	middle	child	who	worked	hard	to	meet	the	high	expectations	of	a	demanding	parent,	that’s	a	sweet	feeling.	Consider,	as	well,	the	more	recent	presidents.	I	stand	on	the	shoulders	of	the	late	David	Strangway,	who	is	widely	credited	with	lifting	UBC	from	being	a	good	regional	institution	in	the	1980s	into	a	great	international	one	by	the	late	1990s.	It’s	no	secret	that	we	all	owe	a	debt	of	gratitude	to	the	redoubtable	Martha	Piper,	who	picked	up	the	pace	of	Strangway’s	transformative	work	and	who	stepped	back	in	last	year	to	settle	and	refocus	the	university	at	a	turbulent	time.	I	admire	–	and	am	instructed	by	–	the	passion,	ambition	and	innovative	spirit	of	Arvind	Gupta.		And,	returning	to	the	international	recognition	of	UBC’s	excellence,	you	may	have	heard	that	Cambridge	University	in	England	has	chosen	Stephen	Toope	to	assume	its	presidential	duties	as	its	346th	Vice-Chancellor.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	9	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	Add	to	the	mix	UBC’s	earlier	presidents,	from	Frank	Wesbrook	to	George	Pedersen,	and	you	have	humbling	list	of	talented	leaders;	I	am	deeply	honoured	to	follow	in	their	footsteps	–	to	help	move	UBC	from	excellence	to	eminence.	One	area	in	which	we	have	achieved	excellence	is	innovation.	Innovation	is	both	vital	and,	at	this	point,	a	little	opaque.	“Innovative,”	as	an	adjective	is	like	“sustainable”.	It’s	one	of	those	words	that	people	use	to	mean	so	many	things	that	it	stops	meaning	anything	at	all.	In	some	ways	“innovative”	has	become	a	synonym	for	“better.”	Yet,	there	is	much	more	to	it	than	that.	In	aspirational	terms,	I	think	of	innovation	as	the	never-ending	exchange	between	the	realities	of	today	and	the	potential	of	tomorrow.	But	it’s	worth	digging	deeper	into	the	definition.	The	Organization	for	Economic	Cooperation	and	Development	–	the	OECD	–	defines	innovation	as	“the	implementation	of	a	new	or	significantly	improved	product	or	process,	a	new	marketing	method,	or	a	new	organizational	method	in	business	practices,	workplace	organization	or	external	relations.”		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	10	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	Simply	put,	Innovation	is	the	implementation	of	something	that	is	new	or	significantly	improved.	There	are	two	critical	elements	here.	The	first	–	the	one	we	probably	think	of	most	often	–	is	the	new	idea:	the	breakthrough	that	might,	one	day,	give	rise	to	a	world-changing	technology	or	a	transformative	new	social	policy.		This	is	the	aspect	of	innovation	people	often	think	about	first	when	they	contemplate	the	role	of	universities.	UBC	is	an	enormous	generator	of	new	ideas	and	knowledge.		Our	annual	research	budget	is	now	more	than	$600	million.	And	a	significant	portion	of	that	funding	rightly	goes	into	fundamental	research,	into	pure	academic	inquiry	–where	we	build	our	basic	understanding	of	the	world	and	the	universe	around	us.	There	is	still	much	to	discover,	and	so	many	opportunities	for	new	ideas	that	could	change	the	world.	Consider,	for	example,	the	work	of	the	Stewart	Blusson	Quantum	Matter	Institute,	where	some	of	the	world’s	foremost	researchers	–	people	like	Andrea	Damascelli	and	Sarah	Burke	–	are	pursuing	an	understanding	of	how	matter	behaves	at	the	most	fundamental	levels,	and	which	may	one	day	yield	discoveries	with	applications	in	electronics	and	information	technology,	in	sustainable	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	11	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	energy,	in	the	automotive	industry	–	even	in	the	health	care	sector.	Or	perhaps	there	are	revolutionary	applications	that	we	have	not	yet	even	imagined.	But	innovation	requires	more	than	new	knowledge	or	a	good	idea.	If	the	new	thing	in	question	is	a	product	or	service,	you	have	to	get	it	to	market.	If	it’s	a	new	method,	you	have	to	get	it	into	practice.	So,	at	its	simplest,	innovation	is	conception-plus-connection.	Of	course,	any	time	you	hear	someone	say,	“at	its	simplest,”	a	little	warning	bell	should	go	off	in	your	head,	because	they	are	probably	talking	about	something	that	isn’t	simple	at	all.	That’s	certainly	the	case	here.	Innovation	has	enemies.	One	is	inertia.	Innovation	is,	necessarily,	disruptive.	The	very	notion	of	a	great	new	product	implies	that	a	lesser	old	product	is	already	in	use.	It’s	why	Joseph	Schumpeter	refered	to	innovation	as	“creative	destruction.”	It	threatens	the	status	quo.	So,	well-established	market	forces	can	be	expected	to	resist.	I	don’t	want	to	say	that	nobody	likes	change,	but	the	people	who	like	it	least	are	often	the	ones	who	are,	today,	in	the	most	powerful	positions.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	12	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	Another	obstacle	to	innovation	is	caution.	No	engineer	wants	to	be	responsible	for	an	innovative	highway	design	that	almost	works.	And	who	wants	to	be	lying	in	the	operating	suite,	drifting	into	unconsciousness,	when	the	surgeon	says,	“Hey,	I’m	thinking	about	trying	something	new!”	…?	People	are	also	cautious	with	their	money,	whether	they	are	investors	or	purchasers.	And	Canadian	investors	have	a	particular	reputation	in	this	regard.	So,	I’m	not	here	today	to	tell	you	that	I	have	the	innovation	riddle	solved.	Premier	Clark	has	asked	the	B.C.	Innovation	Network	to	come	up	with	some	strategies	to	attract	and	retain	talent,	to	encourage	innovative	research,	and	to	ensure	our	students,	young	and	old,	are	well	prepared	to	advance	their	careers	in	a	complex	and	rapidly	evolving	world.	I	hope	we	may	also	conceive	and	implement	some	policy	recommendations	that	address	the	obstacles	–	that	we	may,	ourselves,	innovate.	But	without	prejudging	the	BC	Innovation	Network’s	path,	I	have	a	couple	of	comments	about	the	role	of	UBC	in	the	innovation	ecosystem.	UBC	is	already	deeply	committed	to	both	conception	and	connection.	To	begin,	I	would	argue	that	UBC	is	one	of	B.C.’s	foremost	sources	of	new	ideas.	You	could	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	13	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	look	into	any	part	of	B.C.’s	economy	and	society	and	identify	a	benefit	derived	directly	from	an	innovation	that	originated	at	UBC.	In	health	care,	think	about	AIDS	or	prostate	cancer	research,	brain	health	or	any	number	of	biotechnology	advances.	In	architecture,	think	about	the	works	of	Bing	Thom.	In	mining,	our	engineers	and	our	methods	are	in	demand	around	the	world.	In	computer	science,	the	“(dot)CA”	domain	was	created	by	UBC’s	Computing	Facilities	manager	John	Demco	in	1987	–	two	years	BEFORE	the	emergence	of	the	World	Wide	Web.	Think	about	the	influence	of	UBC	researchers	and	UBC	alumni	in	Law,	in	Psychology,	in	Social	Work,	in	Aboriginal	Studies	–	in	Arts	and	Culture.	In	Environmental	Studies,	the	very	notion	of	an	ecological	footprint	was	conceived	at	UBC	by	Bill	Rees	and	Mathis	Wakernagel.	UBC	is	a	hothouse	for	conception.	But	we	also	connect.	First,	of	course,	we	connect	with	students.	We	don’t	just	instill	knowledge	in	our	students,	we	nurture	skills	and	inspiration.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	14	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	And	they	connect	with	one	another	and	beyond	the	university.	They	carry	newfound	capacities	into	the	community.	I	could	ask	you	to	imagine	the	impact	of	more	than	a	century	of	UBC	grads	in	Vancouver	and	now	Kelowna	–	but	it	would	be	impossible,	in	2017,	to	imagine	either	community	without	the	benefits	of	our	two	campuses.	UBC	connects,	as	well,	to	B.C.’s	other	great	institutions	of	higher	education.	For	example,	we	collaborate	directly	with	the	University	of	Victoria	and	the	University	of	Northern	British	Columbia	in	our	distributed	medical	program,	training	doctors	in	every	part	of	the	province.	We	also	have	connections	with	BCIT,	Simon	Fraser,	Kwantlen	and	other	institutions,	including	BC’s	outstanding	community	colleges,	so	our	programs	are	complementary	and	our	students	can	move	freely	among	institutions,	depending	on	what	mix	of	practical	and	theoretical	knowledge	they	want	or	need.	No	institution	in	North	America	is	better	connected	internationally;	Times	Higher	Education	places	UBC	12th	in	the	world	among	all	universities,	based	on	our	international	reputation,	the	extent	of	our	international	research	collaboration,	the	proportion	of	international	students	and	the	diversity	of	our	students,	faculty	and	staff.	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	15	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono		We	also	enjoy	some	increasingly	powerful	connections	closer	to	home.	As	you	may	have	heard,	we	recently	established	the	Cascadia	Urban	Analytics	Cooperative	with	the	University	of	Washington	in	Seattle,	on	the	strength	of	a	$1-million	gift	from	Microsoft.	We	already	have	extensive	links	to	UW,	but	this	will	be	the	largest	industry-funded	research	partnership	between	our	two	universities,	bringing	faculty,	students	and	community	stakeholders	together	to	solve	problems	in	everything	from	traffic	to	homelessness.	I’m	excited	about	this.	UBC	and	UW	are	natural	partners,	close	and	complementary.	Our	combined	research	spending	is	over	$2	billion.	I’m	also	excited	about	the	Microsoft	connection.	When	the	Cascadia	cooperative	was	announced,	Microsoft	President	Brad	Smith	said	he	saw	the	investment	as	a	catalyst	for	broader	and	more	sustainable	efforts	to	connect	our	two	institutions.	This	mirrors	the	increasing	Microsoft	investment	in	Vancouver	as	an	important	part	of	what	Smith	calls	its	“string	of	pearls”	–	Microsoft’s	highly	creative	West	Coast	offices	stretching	from	here,	south	to	San	Francisco.	Bearing	in	mind	that,	Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	16	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	between	the	Gates	Foundation	and	the	company	itself,	Microsoft	has	been	the	source	of	more	than	$1.3	billion	in	gifts	to	the	University	of	Washington	over	the	past	two	decades.	Needless	to	say	we’re	delighted	to	be	part	of	the	mix.	To	be	clear,	though,	UBC	has	earned	its	place.	Consider	another	research	investment	that	we	announced	this	month:	the	$2-million	Scotiabank	Cybersecurity	and	Risk	Analytics	Initiative.	As	in	so	many	other	fields,	we	have	the	expertise.	And	with	cyberhacking	becoming	an	unnerving	feature	in	so	much	of	our	lives,	this	particular	expertise	was	never	so	urgently	needed.	Taken	together,	you	have	an	example	of	UBC,	in	collaboration	with	post-secondary	partners	at	every	level	and	around	the	world,	translating	ideas	into	action	–	nurturing	(and	recruiting)	highly	qualified	people	and	working	with	the	private	and	social	sectors	to	transform	ideas	into	action.	UBC’s	University	Industry	Liaison	Office,	the	first	of	its	kind	in	Canada	when	it	was	created	in	1984,	now	partners	with	industry,	government	and	non-profit	partners	on	more	than	2,000	projects	a	year	and	has	supported	the	founding	of	190	spin-off	companies	that,	together,	have	generated	more	than	$11	billion	in	sales.		Greater	Vancouver	Board	of	Trade	 	 March	28,	2017	17	Notes	for	UBC	President	and	Vice-Chancellor	Santa	Ono	It	is	no	accident,	then,	that	the	high-tech	industry	in	B.C.	now	employs	more	people	than	all	the	resource	industries	combined.	One	of	the	other	obstacles	to	innovation	that	I	didn’t	mention	earlier	is	competition.	According	to	a	recent	Bloomberg	analysis,	Canada	currently	ranks	20th	among	the	world’s	most	innovative	economies,	down	from	19th	last	year.	Canada	is	a	small,	incredibly	well-educated,	resourceful	and	probably	underfinanced	player	in	a	global	competition	that	we	will	not	win	by	standing	around.	We	need	to	leverage	our	creative	capacity	and	our	connections,	whether	it	means	consciously	developing	industry	clusters	or	building	longer-distance	links	to	the	best	and	brightest	the	world	over.		Let	me	say,	in	all	of	those	task,	UBC	can	compete	and	in	so	doing,	help	British	Columbia	and	Canada	compete	and	succeed.	In	closing,	I’d	like	to	once	more	say	how	honoured	I	am	to	be	here	and	how	excited	I	am	about	what	we	will	do	together	–	for	UBC,	Vancouver,	British	Columbia,	Canada,	and	the	world.	Thank	you.

1.0107489~Law, education, and social change: keynote address to Lawyers’ Rights Watch committee dinner~Toope, Stephen J.~Law, Education, and Social Change Keynote Address to Lawyers’ Rights Watch Committee Dinner  October 4, 2007 The Floata Restaurant, 180 Keefer Street  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  1  Thank you. I feel honoured to have been invited to speak to you this evening. The work of Lawyers’ Rights Watch is necessary and inspiring. Please accept my congratulations.  My topic is the relationship between law and social change, and I want to begin by making a claim that no-one in this room, I believe, would dispute: that social change is meaningless unless it is underpinned by the law. That seems self-evident: for without a system of laws, no society can govern itself, no individual or group can be assured of security, no foundation can be laid for individual, corporate, or national prosperity. And when a society looks to make changes in its governance, no matter how those changes are conceived or promulgated, they must be sustained by legislation that creates a firm and lasting framework—that enshrines change within a shared system of norms and aspirations.  2  By “social change” I want to convey the notion of progressive change—positive changes that are proposed or introduced because they are intended to improve something. Domestically we might be speaking about changes in health care practices, for instance, designed to protect patients; or new approaches to the treatment of homelessness in society. On the international scene we might be addressing such issues as a citizen’s right to freedom from state repression, or regulations affecting personal mobility within national borders. “Social change” is a catch-all phrase that has negative as well as positive connotations, but here I want to use it as short-hand for the kinds of transformations that are intended to benefit us, to protect human rights and improve the conditions of life for all. It’s in that sense that we speak of change in our mission statement at UBC, in which we state: “As responsible members of society, the graduates of UBC will value diversity, work with and for their communities, and be agents for positive change.”  3  For many of us, that aspiration is what drew us into law in the first place: the idea that, through our judicious study and application of the law, or through our influence on the creation of progressive legislation, we might actually make the world a better place—more moral, more compassionate, more just. Such a possibility is reinforced by some of the great legal thinkers. Major legal theorists have argued for a view of law that is almost heroic; think of Ronald Dworkin whose book Law’s Empire espouses a hegemonic view of law’s role in Western societies. Within international law, one of the most interesting, if eccentric, thinkers is Cambridge’s Philip Allott who has written:  The extraordinary progress of the human species would not have been possible without law. We have created a vast world-law in which collective human effort is organized through law, a world of unlimited possibilities of complexity and sophistication.  4  Professor Allott’s view is rooted in the Hegelian view that all of humanity is shaped by a universal, transcendent spirit. For Allott, law is the modern expression of that spirit; it is only through law that we can attack what he creatively calls the current “interstatal unsociety” and build a global society.  At the same time, we need to remind ourselves that the law cannot achieve such noble ends by itself: that it is in practice but one of the elements that, collectively, may bring about social change and realize the potential that lies in the universal human spirit. I trace my own reluctance to place exclusive faith in the power of law to my first encounters with a wonderful Harvard philosopher, Judith Shklar. In her important book, Legalism, Shklar identifies a western culture (especially an American culture) in the thrall of “legalistic” thinking, which she describes as follows:  5  [Legalism is]… the ethical attitude that holds moral conduct to be a matter of rule following, and moral relationships to consist of duties and rights determined by rules. Like all moral attitudes that are both strongly felt and widely shared it expresses itself not only in personal behavior but also in philosophical thought, in political ideologies, and in social institutions.  Shklar argues for a more complex view of human motivation and of human interaction, where what she calls “moral relationships” are not always bounded by fixed “rules”. Those relationships may not always be amenable to rule-bound approaches to legality. It needs to be understood that, if it is to work, law must be more than simply the coercive application of societal rules.  This is nowhere more evident than in the attempts of law, especially international law, to deal with the problems involved in safeguarding human rights. The very term “human rights” is in 6  itself difficult to define, given its many applications. Indeed, it is often invoked as a means of justifying all sorts of activities that have very little to do with what we understand by the phrase: the language of human rights has been used to describe everything from supplying computer systems to courts, to the construction of irrigation systems; from local government reform to the creation of land registries. Human rights becomes everything—and thereby risks becoming nothing.  Setting this kind of distortion aside, I want to maintain that Canadians care about human rights, that human rights are an integral part of our value system, because we collectively believe that human beings matter for themselves. We believe that humans are endowed with a dignity – whatever its origin, secular or divine – that must be upheld by any society that wants to see itself as civilised. This is a moral concept upon which we construct our policy regarding foreign aid, and to some extent our economic and social interaction with other nations. Such an approach allies us 7  with the Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed 60 years ago by the United Nations (and first drafted, I’d like to remind you, by John Peters Humphrey, a Canadian legal scholar and jurist). Our own society is protected by a Charter of Rights and Freedoms that protects individual freedom and equality under the law: no surprise, then, that we should seek to advance those ideals for the benefit of citizens in other nations, and help them achieve those rights that we too often take for granted.  The difficulty that we face is that we cannot hope to effect positive social change in less fortunate countries simply by invoking law or moral conscience. Those of us who work in the area of international law have learned the hard way that, even where legal and social norms can be agreed upon, their application is an entirely different matter. Yes, we have built up an enormous edifice of human rights law; but it is often more honoured in the breach than in performance.  8  In my view, it is misconceived to focus our limited resources on the creation of more and more structures that are intended to enforce human rights norms that are not inclusively supported by people around the world. This is because, as Jurgen Habermas so powerfully argues, rights are relationships, not things. For rights to have meaning, people must be engaged in building up that meaning through their interactions in support of human rights.  In recent times, we have heard understandable cries for an end to “impunity” for violators of human rights. An International Criminal Court has begun investigating perpetrators of crimes against humanity and lodging prosecutions. Regional tribunals already are trying to address similar crimes committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Truth Commissions have been established in states as diverse as Peru and Sierra Leone to identify those who should be subject to punishment. These are, in and of themselves, positive symbolic initiatives. But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that they are key instruments in promoting 9  significant social change in favour of human rights for the inhabitants of our planet. These initiatives are likely to remain relatively marginal. Let me suggest why.  The Tribunals empowered to hear cases involving war crimes and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been hamstrung by an inability to pursue accused perpetrators and by a lack of commitment on the part of the very states which trumpeted their creation. The various committees which sit under a diverse group of international treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, are limited in power and in their permitted scope of inquiry.  With the exception of the Human Rights Committee, when sitting under the terms of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all of the committees are 10  restricted to receiving and commenting upon state reports relating to the national implementation of the relevant convention. The reports of some states are cursory at best, willfully misleading at worst. Even the Human Rights Committee, which has jurisdiction under the Optional Protocol to hear individual complaints, can only "forward its views" at the end of any particular case to the state involved. There is no mechanism for implementation of a committee decision, aside from the court of public opinion.  All of this is no accident. States are willing to create human rights institutions, but they typically do not want them to be effective. Even new institutions like the International Criminal Court, which potentially has real clout but whose authority has not yet been fully tested, or the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, may not be able to function effectively in the face of resource limitations and lack of governmental cooperation.  11  In 2002 I was honoured to be appointed to chair the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nations. This five-member panel of experts was set up in the 1980s, primarily to deal with the phenomenon of the disappeared in South America. Since then, the geographic scope of its work has expanded to include cases from around the globe, and currently roughly 55,000 cases of disappearance remain under active consideration. Through the processes of the Working Group, which are entirely non-adjudicatory, human rights values are fostered and implemented. In recent years the Working Group has conducted successful missions to Colombia and Nepal, where I personally participated in finding six disappeared persons in local jails outside Katmandu. We cleared up a backlog of some 12,000 cases from Sri Lanka.  This is all to the good; but like other international human rights institutions, the Working Group is being strangled by a lack of resources. In 2002, to cope with its backlog of what was then 12  70,000 cases, it had one and a half full-time professional staff members, and a constantly changing cohort of assistants on temporary assignment. The situation has improved since then, but not dramatically. This utterly inadequate complement of staff reveals that international society is not serious about the promotion and protection of human rights, even when mechanisms have already demonstrated their effectiveness. It is easier, and less challenging of governmental power, to create largely symbolic legal structures that cannot easily be used.  Therefore, implementation of human rights norms at the international level is still largely dependent upon bilateral diplomacy, upon political action in multilateral fora such as the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations, or upon the work of committed actors in civil society - - people like y ou who volunteer for Lawyers’ Rights Watch. The alternative to such action is the imposition of human rights rules through coercion; but history has shown that imposed laws that are not founded on a shared sense 13  of obligation don’t work; strategies that focus upon human rights education, community development and institutional strengthening will have more impact than support for formal legal institutions that are charged with enforcing laws that may not be seen as legitimate (or even relevant) by the populace. An exclusive focus upon formal legal, and especially adjudicatory, structures will have limited value. Law has authoritative power, but only when it is mutually constructed, when it arises out of the interaction of a variety of actors and agencies. Law is not a product that is manufactured and distributed for consumption. Citizens in domestic systems and states and other actors at the international level are not consumers; they are active participants in the continuing enterprise of lawmaking.  Rather than looking only at courts to promote human rights then, what is needed is the creation and sustaining of human rights norms through processes of mutual construction engaging people and institutions; and this process must occur alongside the creation 14  of an internationally-accepted understanding of legal legitimacy. As the noted American legal philosopher Lon Fuller has shown, this may only be achieved if states and other international actors can build up shared understandings of right conduct and the appropriate role of law in society; after which, they must work together to ensure that the criteria of legality are met. That is the work of groups like Lawyers’ Rights Watch. Only with this type of work can the force of international law be brought to bear on regimes that might otherwise abuse citizens’ rights; only then can the law be used as an effective instrument for social change. If the application of law is ever to have any lasting impact upon the protection of human rights around the world, future generations must find a way to overcome the barriers in the way of social change. As citizens of Canada, we take for granted a freedom of thought and action that is guaranteed by both law and custom, but this is denied to many others around the world. At UBC, we are trying to build an awareness among our students that, along with the rights and protections that they enjoy, comes an 15  obligation to ensure that others may enjoy those same rights and protections, an obligation to take social and community action on behalf of others less fortunate than oneself. We have adopted the term “global citizenship” as a way of describing the kind of person we hope UBC graduates will become: people who are motivated by the desire to help others, who are driven by a strong moral awareness to use their hard-won skills and knowledge for the benefit of others. Our graduates, we believe, should be people who care deeply enough to learn and then to act—to volunteer, whether at home or abroad, in support of global initiatives for change. In this regard the universities play a crucial role, by providing our society with citizens who not only have the learning and the skills to succeed as professionals in their chosen careers, but also possess the moral conviction and the vision to see the importance of using their knowledge in the interests of creating a better world. They are the future social leaders who will, I trust, succeed where we are stumbling; they will, I believe, break through the legalistic barriers that separate nations to create laws that are based on 16  inclusively created norms and values. Through the concept of “global citizenship” we can hope for a future in which human rights law is created through the interaction of states, international jurists, legal commissions, NGO’s, community groups and individuals, all acting together to transcend borders in the name of our common humanity.  Thank you.  17  
1.0107487~University of British Columbia congregation address : leading through fear, spring 2007~Toope, Stephen J.~UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA CONGREGATION ADDRESS: LEADING THROUGH FEAR  SPRING 2007  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor  Mr Chancellor, Distinguished Guests, Colleagues, Parents and Families of our graduates, Members of the UBC O Class of 2007.  You graduates are probably feeling pretty excited today. A UBC Congregation marks the end of a period of great intensity; university students tend to live life to the fullest. Intense work, intense friendships, intense hopes, intense dreams – even some forms of intensity that I won’t mention today – not in front of your families.  But it wouldn’t surprise me if some of you, perhaps most of you, are feeling more complex emotions. Graduation is rarely about pure elation simply because graduation marks endings and beginnings. Endings are a relief, but they can also prompt wistfulness and nostalgia. Beginnings are full of promise, but also full of uncertainty, and uncertainty can lead to trepidation and anxiety, even to fear. In my brief remarks today, I want to talk about fear and leadership. 2  There is nothing wrong with a little bit of fear. We all experience it from time to time; we may even be genetically programmed to respond to, even to create, our fears. This idea was captured beautifully in a little poem by Philip Larkin. Larkin was an acidic but mild-mannered librarian who also happened to be the poet laureate of England. For those of you who know the poem, you will recognize that I have changed one word for the sake of propriety in a public speech! They [mess] you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra, just for you. But they were messed up in their turn By fools in old-style hats and coats, Who half the time were soppy, stern And half at one another’s throats. Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, And don’t have any kids yourself.  3  I have three children, so I obviously don’t buy Larkin’s prescription. But his insight is real: each of us brings to our lives and our decisions talents, experiences and anxieties. We do indeed learn some of those anxieties from our families; others from our friends; still others from the media buzz that surrounds us; some we may create all by ourselves.  We live in a society that is utterly confused about anxiety and fear. On the one hand extreme sports and corporate logos extol the virtue: “no fear”. On the other hand, we live in a surveillance society where more and more public space is covered by closed circuit television; where we are told to worry about escalating crime even when we know that the incidence of reported crime is actually declining; where governments issue orange alerts warning us to beware of potential terrorist attacks that, as individuals, we can do precious little to prevent.  4  Fear is of course a natural reaction in the face of danger. It is smart to fear a black bear approaching our tent at night looking for food. Good leaders fear the possible negative consequences of their actions and decisions even as they know that that must act and decide. It is probably right to fear the hard moral choices that life forces upon us: when to spare someone from a hurtful truth; when to tell the truth at all costs? Fearful questions indeed.  Some fear is healthy, but some is pathological. I believe that healthy fear must incorporate a modicum of self-doubt. Of course, I acknowledge that confidence is an important, even an essential, trait for success in life. One of the greatest gifts that can be bequeathed by parents, and by schools and universities, is the belief that the possibilities of life are open and almost limitless. My parents and my schooling gave me that gift, and I am profoundly grateful.  5  But overweening self-confidence is a liability. It annoys people around you. More importantly, it is almost always matched by a closed spirit; the person who is utterly confident is not inclined to learn much from others. Leaders lead because they can learn, and inspire others by applying what they have learned. Perhaps ironically, overconfident people are also unlikely to be good at sharing. To believe oneself to be completely self-sufficient is to fail to recognize one’s own needs – including the need to give.  In a challenging and moving book called The Gift, the American polymath philosopher-sociologist-anthropologist Lewis Hyde observes: The belief that life is a gift carries with it the corollary feeling that the gifts should not be hoarded. As we mature, and particularly as we come into the isolation of being ‘on our own,’ we begin to feel the desire to give ourselves away – in love, in marriage, to our work, to the gods, to politics, to children. And adolescence is marked by that restless… disturbing inquisition: Is this the person, this nation, this work, worthy of the life I have to give?  6  One needs both confidence and critical self-reflection to give, or at least to give meaningfully. To lead requires of us that we act confidently, but also that we reflect on, and sometimes correct, our course.  Which brings me back to healthy fear: If we all want to give our lives to something worthy, and I am sure that this is the hope of every graduating student today, how do we find a path to leadership through fear? Note that this word “through” is a trickster, a linguistic Raven. I firmly hope that none of you will achieve a sense of the worthy life by cultivating fear, by merely encouraging fear in others. Since September 11th, 2001, much of our public discourse has been built on fear. Some of the fear has been genuine and well-placed: global terrorism is a deadly reality. But some of the fear has been manipulated and overwrought. It has led to bad policy decisions and dangerous arguments. Some influential politicians have been seduced by Machiavelli’s admonition in the Discourses that a republic may have to “break” 7  its own fundamental “orders” to avoid ruin. I cannot imagine a more dangerous idea in any constitutional democracy, yet this idea finds favour today. It resonates in hearts filled with anxiety and fear. I hope that you will find ways to challenge that kind of fear. No, I don’t advocate that kind of leadership, the kind that exploits fear.  Yet I still hope that you will find ways to lead through fear, by which I mean acknowledging fears that are real and finding ways to get past those fears. In our complex, multicultural societies one of the most debilitating fears is the fear of people unlike ourselves. Sharing your gifts in a world as diverse and interconnected as ours means sharing them with people who make us feel really uncomfortable, with people whose attitudes to fundamental issues are different from our own.  Consider the case of a young Nigerian writer named Ben Okri, who went to study in England in the 1970s. He had prodigious 8  gifts that he wanted to share with the world. Imagine the transition from village life in Nigeria to one of the world’s great and dominating academic centres. Almost everyone was different; everyone was hard to read; everyone was potentially frightening. Some of you have made transitions to UBC that were just as hard, just as frightening.  For Ben Okri, the key to his transition was in holding on to the spirituality of African village life and transforming it into works of fiction prized around the globe. Permit me to conclude with a brief excerpt from one of Ben Okri’s most beautiful poems, “An African Elegy”. This poem is about a particular kind of fear; the fear of an African facing the reality of human suffering all around him. It is a hard poem, but one that holds out great hope. Okri firmly rejects Philip Larkin’s solution to life’s fears: to get out as fast as possible. Instead, Okri embraces the possibilities present in every single human being, the infinite possibilities in each of you:  9  And they tell me that This life is good They tell me to live it gently With fire, and always with hope. There is wonder here And there is surprise In everything the unseen moves. The ocean is full of songs. The sky is not an enemy. Destiny is our friend.  With my heartiest congratulations to all of the members of the UBC class of the 2007, may I share this simple hope: that with confidence and humility you will find your way through fear to leadership, and that you will make destiny your friend. Thank you.  10  
1.0107472~Identity and citizenship after September 11th, 2001 : CERIUM Annual Conference keynote address~Toope, Stephen J.~Identity and Citizenship After September 11th, 2001*  CERIUM Annual Conference Keynote Address  Thursday, April 3, 2008 17h30—19h30  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia * With thanks for outstanding assistance to Ms. Diane Haynes and Ms. Hadley Friedland.  Merci m. le Recteur et mme la Doyenne.  I I begin tonight with another’s words—the words of someone who was stripped of her citizenship, and then her humanity, her home, and even, ultimately, her name. Who spent the last years of her life in hiding, and then in captivity. Who, because of her age and her gender, never voted. Who, because of her ethnicity and her faith, was put to death. She wrote, “How wonderful it is that nobody needs to wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.”1  And how fortunate for every human being who will ever be inspired by her that Anne Frank did not wait. She chose to make a neighbour’s attic home. She chose to be fully human, vulnerabilities and all, as is so apparent in her writing. In spite of oppression, persecution, the imminent threat of death and the atrocity of genocide, she chose to live, fully, in all the time that she had. She embodied a kind of citizenship that no institution can confer, and no terror can take away.  1  Learning to Give, quotes on citizenship, online: http://www.learningtogive.org/search/quotes/Display_Quotes.asp?subject_id=48&search _type=subject ; accessed Friday, March 7, 2008 CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 2  Dans le cadre de cette invitation, on m’a demandé de dire à quoi peut bien ressembler la citoyenneté dans le monde post11 septembre ; ce qu’elle pourrait être ; et ce qu’elle devrait être. Devant l’intensification du volet de la sécurité qui continue d’ébranler les droits de la personne et la démocratie partout dans le monde, les courants dominants au sujet de la citoyenneté se sont fait clairement entendre et ont été surveillés de près au lendemain du 11 septembre. S’il fallait retirer quelque chose de bon de cette horrible journée, ce serait la possibilité d’avoir à choisir à nouveau ce que nous sommes – dans tous les sens de la question – et ce que nous voulons être.  What I want to focus on is the notion of identity as it relates to citizenship and how I think it can enlarge our concept of citizenship, particularly the so-called “global citizenship” we are promoting at universities around the world; I want to examine some of the results of our willingness to trade the power and responsibility of active citizenship for the false promises of absolute protection in the aftermath of September 11th; and I want to address a certain complacency I perceive around the Canadian “identity” and Canadian multiculturalism, and ask how we might set our sights higher in this country, beyond tolerance, to an acknowledgement of our deep diversity and a commitment to  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 3  fostering a genuine sense of belonging in all peoples—all races, faiths, political stripes and orientations; all self-determining communities; first peoples and the newly arrived; the old, and the very young.  Kofi Annan said, “No one is born a good citizen; no nation is born a democracy. Rather, both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime. Young people must be included from birth. A society that cuts off from its youth severs its lifeline.”2 It is no accident that I opened tonight with the words of a teenager. It’s in our teenage years that we grapple most intensely with the questions, Who am I? What might I be? What shall I become?  En tenant compte de mes différentes identités à titre de professeur, de parent et de président d’université ; en m’entretenant avec vous aujourd’hui, et en songeant au chemin que nous sommes appelés à parcourir ensemble au cours des prochains jours, j’aimerais avancer ce que nous faisons réellement ici, c’est tenter d’apporter des réponses viables, sincères et même empreintes de noblesse à ces questions, de les apporter aux enfants que nous élevons et  2  ThinkExist.com, Kofi Annan quotes, online: http://thinkexist.com/quotation/no_one_is_born_a_good_citizenno_nation_is_born_a/151778.html ; accessed Friday, March 7, 2008.

I say that neither as a political statement nor a statement of identity. It’s a tagline for a beer commercial. Or, as the branding experts would have us say in Vancouver these days—regardless of our standings in the League—We are all Canucks. Citizenship as brand. A distinctly neo-liberal concept, no? Imperial globalization, identity as material success and an enduring mistrust of deep diversity are the major challenges facing the concept of citizenship, both nationally and globally, and these issues long predate the events of September 11th.  In James Tully’s definition of ‘modern citizenship,’ “[t]he constitutional rule of law is the first condition of citizenship” and “a person has the status of citizenship in virtue of being subject to civil law in two senses: to an established and enforced system of law, and to the ‘civilizing,’ ‘pacifying’ or ‘socializing’ force of the rule of law on the subjectivity of those who are constrained to obey over time.”3 In short, citizenship as legal status. 3  Tully, at 4.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 5  Jane Jenson explains that, at a minimum, “citizenship defines the population to whom the state owes protection and persons who owe the state loyalty.”4 So, citizenship as relative, and transactional. She adds a third factor to her definition, saying that citizenship can also be described as “the institutionalization of a set of practices by which states use public power to shape and regulate markets and communities.”5 Citizenship as formalized interaction.  Bien que James Tully reconnaisse que la citoyenneté est une « notion politique complexe qui a une histoire »6 et que notre7 façon de concevoir la citoyenneté a évolué et qu’on lui reconnaît maintenant une dimension sociale8, psychologique9, morale, voire spirituelle10, la citoyenneté – en pratique – demeure embourbée dans les limites de son cadre juridique. Et, comme nous en discuterons plus tard, aussi longtemps que nous regarderons la citoyenneté par le petit bout institutionnel, transactionnel et statutaire de la lorgnette, celle-ci demeurera conditionnelle, à la 4  Jenson, “Fated to Live in Interesting Times,” at 628.

Tully’s fourth ‘diverse citizenship’ practice is the grounding of the previous three in ‘experiments with truth’ – a spiritual relationship to oneself in one’s relationship with others and the environing world. 5  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 6  merci des caprices de gouvernements qui sont conditionnellement démocratiques, et à la merci de la peur.  It is these “institutional preconditions and forms of subjectivity” of citizenship that the world’s great powers have exported to the rest of the world, with varying degrees of success, first through colonialism and then through economic hegemony.11 “As a result of the globalization of modern citizenship and its underlying institutions,” Tully says, “the majority of the world’s population of the dispossessed are … ‘free’ to exercise their modern civil liberty in the growing sweatshops and slums of the planet.”12  American president George W. Bush said in an address to the Iraqi people: “The goals of our coalition are clear and limited. We will end a brutal regime, whose aggression and weapons of mass destruction make it a unique threat to the world. Coalition forces will help maintain law and order, so that Iraqis can live in security. We will respect your great religious traditions, whose principles of equality and compassion are essential to Iraq’s future. We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects  11  Tully, at 10. Ibid, at 17.

And then our military forces will leave.”13 That was April 10, 2003.  What occurs to me is that for those—presidents and citizens alike—who tie their sense of security, entitlement and belonging to institutions, including that of divine favour, a conditional conception of citizenship is the only one that is possible. What is necessary, then, if the concept is to evolve, is to locate a sense of safety, rights and belonging elsewhere.  Mention of the current American president led me to ponder the subject of presidential hopefuls, which led me to the question of identity.  III At the risk of repeating myself, I … am … Canadian… de Québec. As a white Anglo-Saxon male raised in Eastern North America, I have experienced few occasions where my identity was clearly at issue. I do remember one challenging moment, however. I was in my first year at Harvard as an undergraduate—a teenager, in other 13  American Rhetoric Online Speech Bank, George W. Bush and Tony Blair, Address to the Peoples of Iraq, online: http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wariniraq/gwbushiraq41003.htm ; accessed March 13, 2008.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 8  words—and the Parti-Québécois was elected for the first time in my home. I remember walking around Harvard Yard that cool night and wondering if my assumptions about, and aspirations for, my future would be possible to fulfill. Would the country that I had known be changed utterly? Could I fit into my newly politicized “home?” Would I belong? Est-ce-que nous nous comprendrions, mon pays et moi? I was a typical Anglo product of the West Island of Montreal, with appalling high school French, avoir and être again and again and George Simenon’s Chien Jaune thrown in. Let me tell you, that night, I redoubled my commitment to my French language skills, a commitment I kept throughout my university years.  Plusieurs années plus tard, je me demande encore si le Canada – et les Canadiens – sont réellement en mesure de relever les défis auxquels nous faisons face. S’ils sont même désireux de relever ces défis. Ou si nous pensons que c’est déjà fait. Je remarque la présence d’un sentiment de relâchement et presque de suffisance comme si nous avions dit notre dernier mot au sujet de la démocratie et du bilinguisme et du multiculturalisme. Je remarque la présence d’un sentiment de confort né d’un sentiment de certitude qui lui-même prend racine dans une tentative d'assourdir, d’aplanir et même de faire disparaître la véritable et profonde  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 9  diversité de ce pays. Je crains parfois que le sentiment profond que j’éprouve en tant que Canadien ne soit, en somme, qu’un sentiment de certitude, que rien d’autre ne peut être fait, qu’on peut se reposer sur nos lauriers.  Michael Walzer envisions a model for citizenship that attaches “a greater value to political possibility, and the activism it breeds, than to the certainty of political success. Certainty,” he says, “is always a fantasy.”14  Someone who has eschewed the certainty of political success in exchange for possibility is U.S. Presidential candidate Barack Obama. He has faced down more than one “identity crisis” in the past, and his opponents are looking to make identity the issue by which he is defeated. They’ve chosen their target well, because his fluid, overlapping identities are a big part of what has gotten him this far.  Who is Barack Obama? That’s the question we’re going to hear as the Clinton campaign and the Republican party mobilize their resources in attempts to defeat their popular opponent. “He’s not  14  Walzer, at 51.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 10  who he says he is,” is their underlying message.15 He does in fact have a complex racial and personal heritage; born in America, he never knew his Kenyan father, grew up with his mother in Indonesia and with his white grandparents in multiracial Hawaii, and grappled with his African-American identity. Geraldine Ferrero accused him of having an unfair advantage in the primary race because he is black,16 and he has also had to refute rumours that he is Muslim—polls show 45 per cent of Americans would be less likely to vote for a candidate if they knew he or she was Muslim—but he has had to do so without implying to Muslim American citizens that the assertions are inherently objectionable.17 He seems comfortable with these complexities, and therefore comfortable negotiating the multiplicities of human identity that characterize American society.18  It has been said that “in Barack Obama, [the] biracial son of an immigrant, millions see themselves.”19 I would argue that as 15  Skelton, at A4-5.

Note: these so-far unidentified rumours have been spread via the Internet; this is an instance of the power of the Internet possibly working against Obama. 18 Fellman, Michael, “It’s President Obama,” The Tyee (21 February 2008), online: http://thetyee.ca/Views/2008/02/21/PrezObama/?utm_source=mondayheadlines&utm_m edium=email&utm_campaign=250208 accessed February 25, 2008. 19 Robinson, at 30-31. 16  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 11  powerful as his messages of hope and change in drawing supporters is his fluid identity, this “liminality,” as he calls it. Liminality is from the Latin, meaning “threshold,” and refers to a period of transition where normal limits on thought, selfunderstanding and behaviour are relaxed, allowing for new perspectives.20 It is the state of the new immigrant, the state of the dual citizen, of the child of a mixed-race couple, of the minority striving to belong. It is the state of the artist immersed in creation, the scientist in experimentation, the researcher in exploration. It is perpetually the state of the teenager. And it is the domain of that threshold world we call the Internet. On the Internet, Jane Jenson’s “country of communities”21 is already an uncontested reality. From chat rooms to discussion forums, from MySpace to Facebook, Internet users are in many places at once, presenting and identifying themselves in whatever way—or ways—they choose. On a site called Second Life, users create avatars, or second selves, animated characters that they can design to look just like them—or not. To act and interact with others’ avatars just as they might in “real” life—or not. They are, in effect, citizens of an alternate reality. There are no borders on 20  “Liminality,” online: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality accessed February 25, 2008. 21 Jenson, “Fated to Live in Interesting Times,” at 640. CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 12  the Internet, and so you may find yourself in a community that is actually deeply transnational. On the other hand, you might not even be aware of that, and if you were, it probably wouldn’t be relevant. Online communities are built on foundations of common interests, shared histories, need for information, desire for connection over isolation,22 and even—or perhaps especially—a desire to disagree in a safe environment.23 Your identity and the communities you identify with have nothing to do with actual place. Michael Walzer’s “set of alternative centers and increasingly dense web of social ties that cross state boundaries”24 takes on another level of meaning in the online context.  For those of us who may remain skeptical of the Internet’s influence in enlarging our understanding of identity, or of its relevance to a discussion of citizenship, I have some stories and statistics:  The man who invented the term “cyberspace,” Vancouver-based, bestselling novelist William Gibson, launched his latest 22  Referring to Webber, “The Hobbesian Premise,” at 9. “Acquiescing [to society’s precepts] is tantamount to choosing the benefits of society over the hazards of isolation.

Mais je suis en train de dire que voici un lieu où certains des idéaux démocratiques et des notions d’identité fluides auxquels, selon nos dires, nous aspirons, sont mis en pratique tous les jours, sans que quiconque en soit nécessairement conscient, par des gens qui viennent du monde entier – et particulièrement des jeunes.

CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 15  l’isolement social – mais certainement pas davantage que dans la « vraie » vie. A year before September 11th, 2001, Joseph Carens was already writing about “multiple forms of belonging and overlapping citizenships” and differentiating between social, psychological and legal citizenship. He noted that there was already an increasing multiplicity in citizenship even in legal conceptions, and that fears about problems such as taxation or applicability of legal rules proved to be largely unfounded.31  We understand identity, because we know ourselves to be complex beings with myriad aspects to our nature; to have the ability to hold in mind two opposing viewpoints at the same time; to be able to be fiercely loyal to our home country while possessed of an undying love for the country we left behind. Until now, we have slotted governments’ restrictive, conditional definitions of citizenship within our understanding of our identity, the smaller concept finding a place somewhere within the larger. What I am suggesting is that we are being asked now to use our ever-expanding understanding of identity to enlarge our notions of citizenship, so  31  Carens, at 162-163.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 16  that the dynamic between the two may become one of interplay and interdependence.  As a window on identity- and community-building practices around the world, many of which still fall below the political radar, and as a forum in which to engage in or just observe some of these practices freely within and across borders, the Internet—and the exponential growth of social networking since September 11th— are tools from which we can learn.  And we need to use all the tools at our disposal. As we who work with and study these issues have acknowledged, the events of September 11th and their political aftermath have brought questions of citizenship, multiculturalism, minority rights and human rights generally to a crossroads, and what hangs in the balance may be nothing less than democracy itself.  IV I happened to be in New York on September 11th, 2001, and I witnessed the sickening events unfold from a 49th-floor office in midtown Manhattan. I also witnessed first hand the response that asked for safety at any cost: ‘Make me safe. Make my loved ones safe. Get me home.’  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 17  I preside over a university that was placed under security lockdown twice in the early part of this year. And so I understand the impulse to protect, the motivation to identify a target, and quickly, the desire to see everyone—all 50,000 of them—home safe.  When we are afraid, it is easy to mistake security for peace. But in the security culture we have constructed worldwide since September 11th, I think we have ample evidence that security is not, and cannot lead us to, peace. We would do better to call our Security Culture by a more accurate name; it is a Culture of Want and Fear.  Despite the power human rights has exercised in advancing international law and politics, particularly since the end of the Cold War, it has failed to deliver on at least two of President Roosevelt’s famous four freedoms: millions of innocents continue to starve, so, despite progress in some parts of the world, the freedom from want has not been promoted effectively enough. Similarly, the scourge of AIDS, tyrannical (or as often) failed government and organized brutality subject innocents to a fear that undermines many other human rights gains. Since September 11th, all around the world, states have crafted laws nominally designed  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 18  both to protect citizens and advance the so-called “war on terror.”32 The West’s response has been predictably regrettable: throw money at the security apparatus and round up the usual suspects.33 The effect has been to exacerbate want and fear. Kim Scheppelle describes the UN Security Council resolutions following September 11th as the “second wave of international law,”34 where international securitization demands override individual governments’ decision making on human rights concerns and threaten to erode the gains made since the “first wave,” post World War II.  Further, in much of the developing world, repressive regimes have used anti-terror rhetoric as a cover for a frontal assault on opposition forces or on peoples claiming a right of selfdetermination. And all the while, the West watches idly as newfound allies in the war against terror engage with impunity in systematic human rights abuses.35  An egregious example is in Russia, where President Putin cynically exploited Russia’s membership in the coalition against terror to use scorched-earth policies in what was essentially a 32  Toope, “Fallout from 9-11,” at 285. Ibid, at 284. 34 Scheppele, 2007. 35 Toope, “Fallout from 9-11,” at 282, 283, 286, 287. 33  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 19  domestic separatist conflict in Chechnya. Washington obliged by muting its criticism.36 The West has also turned a blind eye to China’s repression in the heavily Muslim Xinjiang region, where Beijing tendentiously claims linkages between Islamic militants and al Qaeda.37 Egypt; Sudan; Tajikistan; Uzbekistan; Zimbabwe; Israel, the Palestinian Authority: the pattern repeats.  Another form the Security Culture has taken in western and European states is a demand for homogeneity in the name of national unity. Several countries, including the U.S., Australia, England and Germany have recently introduced compulsory hundred-question “citizenship exams” for immigrants, who are increasingly expected to sign on to shared values and commit to civic integration before being granted citizenship.38 In Europe, the greatest concern is over Muslim immigrants who, in countries such as France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, comprise 80% of nonEuropean immigrants and appear to be the greatest beneficiaries of European multicultural policies.39 A particularly bizarre example 36  Toope, “Fallout from 9-11,” at 288. Ignatieff, in Toope, “Fallout from 9-11,” at 288. 38 For news on the British test, see: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4391710.stm ; the Australian test: http://www.smh.com/au/news/national/new-citizens-face-test-on-200questions/2006/12/11/1165685615942.html ; the American test: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/washington/28citizen.html ; the German test: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/international/europe/29letter1.html?pagewanted=all 39 Kymlicka, at 124. 37  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 20  of this loyalty test trend is the Netherlands’ version, which requires would-be citizens to watch a film that includes scenes of two men kissing, and topless woman walking on a beach, to test their readiness for participation in Dutch liberal culture.40 It is worth noting that these tests of loyalty and commitment are never applied to people who are born to a place, by accident as it were, but only to those who choose to live in a place, deliberately and consciously. Do we seriously believe that every native born Dutch citizen is completely at ease with publicly expressed homosexuality? Just ask members of the hard right or some Dutch Christian evangelicals.  The Security Culture’s effectiveness is grounded in the assumption that want and fear are basic to the human condition.41 It divides the world into forces of good and evil and dehumanizes the enemy. Thus it precludes on the part of the “good” any critical assessment of the policy choices that perpetuate “horrendous inequalities of life-situations” between rich and poor both in the North and in the South, and entrenches a dangerous level of frustration and despair.42 A focus on external threats, real or perceived, distracts 40  Richard Bernstein, “A Quiz for Would-Be Citizens Tests Germans’ Attitudes,” New York Times, March 29, 2006, online: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/international/europe/29letter1.html?pagewanted=all 41 Young, “The Logic of Masculinist Protection,” at 7 (paraphrased). 42 Tully, at 12. CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 21  states from attending to the growing contradictions between the western world’s promises and its outcomes. The push to bring “freedom and democracy” to oppressed people through militarization ignores these same people’s need for social, economic and cultural rights. And a focus on “civic integration” for new citizens ignores the need for support and resources required to avoid the deep divisions and despair engendered by being stuck in a permanent under-class.  The imposition of a Security Culture is not wholly a top-down decision, however, but the result of a tacit agreement between governors and governed. The transaction, as stated by Iris Marion Young, is this: “Forgo freedom, due process, and the right to hold leaders accountable, and in return we will make sure that you are safe.”43 Young asks “how citizens and their representatives in a democracy can allow such rapid challenge to their political principles and institutions with so little discussion and protest,” and offers a two-part answer:  First, most of us who are willing to trade certain rights for improved security generally believe that our own rights and freedoms will not actually be threatened. In effect, though, as one 43  Young, “The Logic of Masculinist Protection,” at 13.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 22  of my Sudanese doctoral students told me: in saying they are willing to trade rights for security, most people think they are trading his rights for their security!  The second, and perhaps deeper, explanation, is the “mobilization of fear.”44 Young cites John Keane45 on the subject; he says: “‘Fear is indeed a thief. It robs subjects of their capacity to act with or against others. It leaves them shaken, sometimes permanently traumatized. And when large numbers fall under the dark clouds of fear, no sun shines on civil society... Fear eats the soul of democracy.’”  La culture de sécurité se sert de la peur pour élever le protecteur au rang d’autorité supérieure et rétrograder les citoyens reconnaissants à un niveau de dépendance.46 Il ne s’agit plus d’une dynamique qui met en présence une personne qui gouverne et un citoyen, mais plutôt un État et son sujet. De la façon dont James Tully perçoit la citoyenneté dans une démocratie, le « bon citoyen » est tout le contraire du sujet silencieux soumis à un État de sécurité. Il soutient que c’est justement en contestant et en  44  Young, “The Logic Masculinist Protection,” at 13. Keane, at 235. 46 Young, “The Logic of Masculinist Protection,” at 13. 45  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 23  résistant que les sujets deviennent de bons citoyens et que, forcés d’écouter, les dirigeants apprennent à bien gouverner.47  V It’s comforting to view travesties of democracy at arm’s length, to castigate other states for their apparent failures, while we hold, rather smugly, to the grail of Canadian multiculturalism. After all, as Will Kymlicka points out, multiculturalism’s advances have been significant: we have navigated bilingualism with some success (though less than some believe) and grappled peacefully with the question of Québec as a distinct society or nation; multiculturalism has shone a light on “the plights of minorities around the world and helped legitimize their claims-making and political mobilization;” it has “made space for ethnic and other minorities [here at home] to peacefully and democratically voice their concerns and aspirations;” and “encouraged minority groups to formulate their claims within the framework of human rights norms.”48 But Canadian multiculturalism has demonstrated itself to be a movable concept in the wake of September 11th, as much subject to the mobilization of fear as the country’s policies toward minorities have proven in the past. 47 48  Tully, at 3. Kymlicka, at 315.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 24  A year after September 11th, two immigration detention centres in Montreal, normally half-occupied, were filled to bursting, mostly with people who fit specific ethnic and religious profiles. One of my former students at McGill, a Sikh, was twice singled out for full-body searches at Canadian airports, when no “white” passengers were searched. Maher Arar, a dual Syrian-Canadian citizen since 1991, was visiting relatives in Tunisia in 2002 when he was detained in New York, held on suspicions of terrorism, and then deported to Syria where he was held and tortured for 13 months. Upon his release, he issued a statement in which he said, “I want to know why this happened to me ….What is at stake here is the future of our country, the interests of Canadian citizens, and most importantly Canada’s international reputation for being a leader in human rights where citizens from different ethnic groups are treated no different than other Canadians.”49 I was the independent fact-finder appointed by the Maher Arar inquiry, and I remain both honoured by the role the inquiry played in Mr. Arar’s rehabilitation and deeply saddened that such a thing could happen at all.  49  MaherArar.ca, “Maher’s Story,” online:  http://www.maherarar.ca/mahers%20story.php accessed March 11, 2008. CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 25  I am saddened, too, to realize that these repressive and indiscriminate actions fall into a distressing but long tradition in Canada, as in the rest of North America. The incarceration of Japanese citizens during the Second World War is a blot on our human rights record. The hasty invocation of the War Measures Act during the October Crisis of 1970 demonstrates again the understandable, but nonetheless dangerous, tendency to sacrifice human rights and civil liberties when confronted with terrorist violence.50 And for Aboriginal people, Canada has almost always been a Security Culture. Church and state attempts to “civilize” and “assimilate” them were in fact a systematic eradication of their languages, cultures and community rendered through the Indian Residential Schools.  Il n’est toutefois pas inévitable que la sécurité triomphe sur les droits de la personne. De fait, on a pu voir des signes positifs de résistance au phénomène de sécurisation post-11 septembre. Tout récemment, plus précisément en février dernier, conformément à une décision de la Cour suprême, le gouvernement canadien a désigné des avocats à titre de « défenseurs spéciaux » afin de témoigner contre les preuves secrètes déposés dans des causes incriminant des immigrants soupçonnés de terrorisme. Il faut 50  Toope, “Fallout from 9-11,” at 285.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 26  attendre que cette loi fasse ses preuves, mais le fait qu’elle existe oblige au moins à une certaine pondération. Une nouvelle loi interdit en outre de se servir des preuves qui sont extirpées sous l’effet de la torture dans les prisons étrangères.51  Je persiste à dire que les droits de la personne font partie intégrante du système de valeurs du Canada, que nous croyons collectivement en la valeur intrinsèque de l’être humain… que l’être humain est doté d’une dignité – quelle que soit son origine, laïque ou divine – qu’il faut faire respecter aussi longtemps que nous voudrons nous percevoir comme une société civilisée.  Canadian multiculturalism is one outward expression of that belief, and the trend toward liberal multiculturalism internationally, according to Will Kymlicka, is “a new stage in the gradual working out of the logic of human rights, and in particular the logic of the idea of the inherent equality of human beings, both as individuals and as peoples.”52 Going beyond the protection of basic civil and political rights, multiculturalism “extend[s] some level of 51  Freeze, Colin and El Akkad, Omar, “New Security Certificates Issued” and “Legislation Bans Use of Evidence Tied to Torture” in The Globe and Mail (22 February 2008) online: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/templates/hub?hub=Search& searchType=Advanced&searchText=law&searchDateType=searchDateRange&searchDa tePreset=all&from_date=20080222&to_date=20080222&sortType=first&start_row=11& start_row_offset1=0&num_rows= accessed February 23,2008. 52 Kymlicka, at 88. CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 27  public recognition and support for ethnocultural minorities to maintain and express their distinct identities and practices.”53 But Kymlicka fears we’ve reached a “critical point” in multiculturalism’s evolution, and that we must “move beyond platitudes about the value of ‘diversity’ and ‘tolerance’” to address hard questions about how liberal multiculturalism relates to issues of democratization, human rights, development and regional security.54 He argues that acceptance and adoption of multiculturalism in new democracies, and ongoing public support for it here in Canada, depend on feelings of both individual and collective safety, and that when these feelings are eroded, multiculturalism will face—and is facing now—backlash and retreat.55  He is quick to say, however, that: opposition to liberal multiculturalism is not solely the result of prejudice, ignorance or xenophobia. The reality is that [it] has costs and imposes risks, and these costs vary enormously both within and across societies. Multiculturalism not only challenges people’s traditional understandings of their cultural and political identity, but 53  Kymlicka, at 15. Ibid, at 23. 55 Ibid, at 128. 54  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 28  also has potential implications for processes of democratization, economic development, respect for human rights and even for geo-political security. Liberal multiculturalism, in some times and places, can be a highrisk choice.56  I must ask, though, whether Canada is really one of those places. Until September 11th, we had in place to greater and lesser degrees all five of the conditions Kymlicka identifies as providing the key foundations for liberal multiculturalism: (1) increasing rights consciousness; (2) demographic shifts in the majority-minorities balance; (3) multiple access points for safe political mobilization; (4) de-securitization of ethnic relations; and (5) consensus on human rights. Was our hold on those foundations so flimsy that our 20-year history with the Multiculturalism Act could be set aside after September 11th with relative political ease? Have we become so risk-averse a society that we are willing to forego the ideals enshrined in our Multiculturalism Act and Charter of Rights and Freedoms for the false promises of guaranteed safety?  Kymlicka, like many others, claims that we are at a crisis point in the history of multiculturalism, human rights and democracy itself. 56  Kymlicka, at 20.  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 29  When a country as stable as Canada can set the rights of its citizens aside in the name of a dubious security, I admit it’s tempting to agree with him. There is a Chinese proverb that says, “A crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind.” The danger is real; I think we’ve proven that to ourselves. And so we must remember now that the opportunity is no less real. This is a time for choice. An opportunity to choose anew—as individuals, as communities, and as nations—who we are, what we could be, what we most wish to be. I am placing my faith in the global citizen.  VI Où que j’aille aujourd’hui sur la planète, toutes les grandes universités prétendent former des « citoyens du monde ». C’est ce que l’on fait à l’université de la Colombie-Britannique. C’est inscrit dans l’énoncé de notre vision. Mais j’avoue avoir été déconcerté lorsque j’ai entendu parler de cet objectif pour la première fois. J’ai tout de suite associé, dans mon esprit, l’expression « citoyenneté du monde » au phénomène de mondialisation et à tout le discours qui l’entoure. Il ne s’agit tout de même pas seulement de trouver un emploi excitant à Hong Kong, Londres ou à New York; de développer le commerce international du Canada ; de recoloniser la planète à l’aide de  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 30  « citoyens du monde » qui ne sont que des agents de domination économique ?  Il était important à mes yeux de « libérer » la notion de « citoyenneté du monde » du discours de la mondialisation. La citoyenneté du monde doit être animée par autre chose que le désir de faire des profits ou la soif de pouvoir. Elle doit être soutenue par la reconnaissance que – en tant qu’êtres doués de moralité – nous sommes ici pour nous aider mutuellement. Et nous ne pouvons pas tourner le dos à ceux qui ont moins de chance que nous sans nous compromettre nous-mêmes d’une certaine manière notre propre humanité.  To be clear, I have not entirely lost my faith in the institutions of citizenship. In fact I believe institutional support for civil rights, and for social and economic rights, is necessary in order to make such rights meaningful. However, I think it is misconceived to focus our limited resources on the creation of more and more structures that are intended to enforce rights norms that are not inclusively supported by people around the world.  I think, too, that citizens feel disenchanted with, and disempowered by, naïve platitudes about “valuing diversity” and “respecting our  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 31  neighbours” and “shared values” put forward by governments and international organizations that equate sameness with safety. We are not “all the same” under our skin! We are actually deeply different. But difference doesn’t preclude belonging, or loyalty, or safety. In fact, it may be in acknowledging our deep differences that we find we are finally comfortable enough to belong, respected enough to be loyal, visible enough to be safe.  In a phrase I love, Iris Marion Young calls this process “the being together of strangers.” She warns that the result of maintaining the illusion of homogeneity is to reinforce existing and entrenched inequalities among differently situated groups.57 Jeremy Webber argues for “a deliberately rudimentary theory of political legitimacy” that would allow for “the possibility of community in the face of deep normative disagreement.”58 He posits that people have good reasons—such as friendship, mutual assistance, conversation, love—for “choosing the benefits of society over the hazards of isolation;”59 and, there will always be disagreement, in every community.  57  Young, “Polity and Group Difference,” at 257. Webber, at 5. 59 Ibid, at 9. 58  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 32  But because people have good reasons for choosing to belong, they will acquiesce to some norms in the interest of the community being peaceful and just. Tariq Modood argues that governments may promote civic integration and combat an apparent democratic crisis of inertia, not by demanding that people “sign on to shared values”, as with the new citizenship tests, but by implementing policies that affirm the values of interdependence and human sociability.60  James Tully and others have coined the term “glocal” to describe the sets of negotiated practices by which peoples all over the world are living out what Tully calls “diverse citizenship.” “Diverse citizenship,” he says, “is not a status given by the institutions of the modern constitutional state and international law, but by negotiated practices in which one becomes a citizen through participation.”61 The diverse tradition places human actors and activities before rights, rules, institutions and processes.62 It eschews taking one institutionalized form of citizenship as the universal model but instead allows for “a multiplicity of criss-crossing and overlapping  60  Modood, “Multicultural Citizenship,” at 153. Tully, at 3. 62 Ibid, at 18. 61  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 33  practices of citizenship.”63 Citizenship exists, not in institutions or political hierarchies, but in relationships.  Tully notes that one of the most astonishing examples of this form of citizenship is “the survival and resurgence of 300 million Indigenous peoples with their traditions of governance and citizenship after 500 years of genocide, dispossession, marginalization, and relentless assimilation.”64 But he also notes that in the modernized West, a vast repertoire of local citizenship practices have survived within the structures of conventional citizenship, such as “traditional working class organizations and countless new and creative forms of co-ops and networks linking rural and urban citizens in countless ways and around countless civic goods ...”. Most hopefully, Tully says, “If all the millions of examples of civic and glocal citizenship practices could be taken in a single view … perhaps this would help to dissipate the sense of disempowerment and disenchantment the present crisis induces.”65 What it comes down to, he says, is “the daily practice of making oneself an exemplary citizen.”66  63  Ibid, at 19. Tully, at 25. 65 Ibid, at 28. 66 Ibid, at 29. Tully uses the example of Mahatma Gandhi as someone whose “ordinary civic and glocal life continues to move millions of people to begin to act.” 64  CERIUM Conference 2008  Toope—Keynote Address  Page 34  Which brings me back to the global citizen. I decided, in the end, to ask some UBC students what it meant to them. And what they said was, “it means caring and acting.” I would add “learning” in between. Caring about our fellow citizens in Canada, and about the challenges faced by our fellows in all parts of the world. Learning how to analyze ways of effecting change, and then acting by making choices in our own lives that support respect for others and fairness in consumption of resources. Acting by working in solidarity with our neighbours, and by volunteering. Acting politically as well, through NGO campaigns, through political parties and through global initiatives for change. Acting on the opportunity present in this post-September 11th crisis, and in every crisis. Acting, not in some imagined future when our governing institutions have eradicated fear for us, but in spite of fear. Acting as citizens. And acting now. And how wonderful that we don’t have to wait a single moment.

Dr. Splane’s contributions to Canadian social policy and his work on behalf of agencies like UNICEF and the International Council of Social Welfare have given him a well-deserved reputation as a progressive, wide-ranging, and influential thinker, someone whose ideas have had a profound effect on this country’s policies both at home and abroad. I feel honoured to be associated with Dr. Splane in this way.  My remarks are entitled “A Right to Escape Poverty?” Let me begin by addressing the question-mark in my title. Am I challenging the view that people are entitled to a life of reasonable comfort, with access to all the basic necessities that make life possible—food, water, shelter, security of person? Am I questioning the validity of the claim made in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  2  Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Clearly, I am not opposed to such sentiments, nor indeed to any of the other assertions made in the Declaration. As a proponent of human rights and international law, I firmly believe in the right of all human beings to enjoy equal rights, liberty, and what Franklin Roosevelt described as the “freedom from fear”; and to make those conditions possible, one must be able to rise above the constraints and limitations created by poverty.  The question I am posing in my title is: can poverty be overcome simply by the establishment and articulation of rights? What A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  3  exactly do we mean when we assert a right, and how do we make such notions meaningful?  First, let me remind you of the dimensions of the problem. Everyone here is familiar, at least in general terms, with the nature and scale of poverty around the world, though of necessity understandings of what constitutes poverty will differ from country to country. In Canada we have no absolute scale by which to measure the concept of poverty: there have been attempts to match dollar incomes against “basic needs,” and on such a scale it has been calculated that currently a family of four would have difficulty meeting basic needs with an income below about $23,000 annually.1 Such measures are only guidelines at best, however, for they operate against the background of a society which provides healthcare, public schooling, welfare support, minimum wage laws, and so on.  1  Chris Sarlo, “Poverty in Canada: 2006 Update,” Fraser Alert, p.2.

Splane Lecture  4  Imagine instead a society in which none of these conditions apply, and in which the average annual income for a family is a fraction of what is regarded as barely acceptable in Canada. Last month the World Bank estimated that “1.4 billion people, or one quarter of the population of the developing world, lived below our international line of $1.25 a day in 2005 prices.” 2  To take this a little further: It has been calculated that 95% of the world’s population lives on less than $10 a day; and that 40 percent of the world’s population—around 2.6 billion people— account for just 5% of the world’s income.  And let me give you one last, grim statistic: that 25,00030,000 children die around the world each day—almost 10 million a year—before they reach the age of five, deaths directly 2  Data & Research: The World Bank. <http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&piPK=64165421&theSitePK=4693 72&menuPK=64166093&entityID=000158349_20080826113239> Retrieved 14 September 2008.

The numbers are so large as to be almost meaningless; they are simply too hard - - and perhaps too sad - - to grasp. Research in social psychology tells us that people are much more likely to be influenced by concrete cases of poverty, malnutrition and death. Hence the power of child sponsorship schemes. However, development research tells us that it is exactly that desire to make concrete and to personalize that tends to move people away from systemic analysis and action. Yes, helping one person is helping the world, but it is unlikely to change the world.  The UN’s Human Development Report for 2007-2008 tries to find some hope in our situation, asking us to view statistics longitudinally, and not in the immediate term:  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  6  Since the first Human Development Report was published in 1990 there have been spectacular—if spectacularly uneven—advances in human development. The share of the population living in developing countries on less than US$1 a day has fallen from 29 percent in 1990 to 18 percent in 2004. Over the same period, child mortality rates have fallen from 106 deaths per thousand live births to 83 and life expectancy has increased by 3 years. Progress in education has gathered pace.3  These figures point to a gradual amelioration of the world’s poverty—yet at a rate that hardly suggests a foreseeable end to misery, hardship, and death for millions and millions of people who lack the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter, let alone medical care or schooling. The Report continues less optimistically:  3  Human Development Report 2007/2008: 1. The 21st Century Climate Challenge, p. 24. http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Chapter1.pdf Retrieved 14 September 2008.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  7  Only around 32 countries out of 147 monitored by the World Bank are on track to achieve the Millennial Development Goal of a two-thirds reduction in child mortality by 2015. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are comprehensively off track. On current trends the MDG target will be missed by a margin that will represent 4.4 million additional deaths in 2015. (p.25)  In his 2007 Commencement address at Harvard, Bill Gates observed: “[H]umanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries – but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity – reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.” But in the face of continuing global poverty, what is to be done?  We know that there are many non-governmental agencies that are dedicated to fighting poverty all over the world—Oxfam, for A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  8  example, has been engaged in famine relief and development aid around the globe for over 60 years; similarly CARE, the “Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere,” was founded at about the same time, and operates in 70 countries around the world. These and many other non-governmental agencies contribute billions of dollars every year to address poverty and sickness, and do a wonderful job. But the difficulty they face in many, if not most cases, is that they exist in a kind of moral and political vacuum: in most of the places that they operate, they cannot effect the kinds of changes in law or governance that might help to attack the roots of poverty. Indeed, such organizations often produce a negative response in local regimes that see them as introducing western ideas and values that might threaten the current power structure.  At the level of state involvement, there have been many attempts to come to some kind of international understanding about the need to eradicate poverty and its most obvious manifestation, hunger. A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  9  From the time of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights onwards, the UN has addressed the issue of poverty through a series of international declarations and covenants, and urged nations around the world to work together to find solutions. In 1974, governments attending the World Food Conference agreed that "every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop their physical and mental faculties."  In 1996, a similar conference, the “World Food Summit” organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, produced what is known as “The Rome Declaration on World Food Security,” in which many heads of state affirmed “the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”:  Here is what they said: We pledge our political will and our common and national commitment to achieving food security for all A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  10  and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015….. We reaffirm that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication. Democracy, promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, and the full and equal participation of men and women are essential for achieving sustainable food security for all. 4 This is a clear and straightforward declaration of what we would all consider to be fundamental human rights, and it is followed by a concrete plan of action that begins: 4  World Food Summit: archived web-site. <http://www.fao.org/wfs/index_en.htm> Retrieved 14 September 2008.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  11  We will ensure an enabling political, social, and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace, based on full and equal participation of women and men, which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all….  Given these ringing declarations, what has happened? Well, as we saw from the Human Development report I cited earlier, the situation a dozen years after the Rome conference is bleak, and while there is reason to believe that there has been improvement, no-one is under any illusions about the prevalence of poverty and hunger in large parts of the world today.  Why, given such widespread agreement about the nature of the problem and possible solutions, are we making so little headway? Why, given all the resources, all the material wealth A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  12  and technological know-how in the developed nations, can we not simply help people attain what all agree is theirs by right?  Part of the problem lies in our understanding of what is meant by “human rights,” for contrary to the confident assumption underlying such documents as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, not all nations necessarily agree upon a common definition. We talk about rights as though such a concept existed like a law in physics—outside ourselves, something eternal and immutable over which no-one has any power. This is the premise behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. It was adopted by the United Nations in response to the horrors of the Second World War; the intention was to set forth principles that would form the basis of peace, liberty, and freedom from fear and want among all the peoples of the world.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  13  The preamble of the Declaration gives us the foundation on which the articles are erected: it opens with the words, “Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world….” 5 Universally applicable as such statements may seem, the fact remains that international human rights law, as articulated in key international instruments like the Universal Declaration, is rooted in philosophy and political evolution grounded largely in Western culture and history. Words like “freedom” and “justice” may not carry the same meaning for an educated European, say, as they would for someone working in rural Asia or Africa.  When we speak for example of “the individual’s right to privacy,” a matter of concern to Vancouverites just now because of security preparations for the up-coming Olympics, would someone living in  5  Taken from the website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, <http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm> Retrieved 14 September 2008. A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  14  China or Indonesia understand exactly what we mean? It’s more likely that they would look at the world from the perspective of collective rights and responsibilities. Westerners, by contrast, are encouraged to perceive themselves as individuals, and taught to fight for the rights of the individual. As to privacy: well, those of you who have done some traveling will know what a variable concept that is in different parts of the world.  This is not to say that there is an unbridgeable gap between cultures here—that, in the words of Kipling’s ballad, “East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet”—there are similarities as well as differences in outlook and values. But there are problems of definition. Add to this the fact that, even in a highly individualistic society like ours, rights are not absolute; depending upon circumstances, they may be trumped by other rights. Your right to freedom of expression, for instance, must give way to my right to be protected from hate speech. Human rights are not in themselves a legal concept; however, what gives A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  15  the notion of “rights” its meaning, is the framework of law by which the idea of human rights is structured, articulated, and protected, and by means of which such rights are implemented and related one to another.  What are the implications of all this for any attempt to implement the principles promulgated by the United Nations and other world bodies? Of the 192 nations that currently form the UN, 162 have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which affirms the right of citizens of a country to an adequate standard of living, free primary school education, freedom from hunger, equal opportunity, and a host of other rights which we would take for granted. Yet we know very well that some of the signatories to this agreement have not lived up their obligations, have not met its terms, and in some cases have committed abuses against their own citizens. In such cases, the UN committee involved should be able to identify the offender and  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  16  the offence, and require that the terms of the covenant be complied with.  The problem is that such international covenants have no practical means of enforcement. The bodies that draw them up and seek to apply them exist essentially at the discretion of the states that created them; they are limited in power and in their permitted scope of inquiry, and they are powerless to intervene in the affairs of states that reject them. There are a few legal mechanisms that may be invoked if one state wishes to punish another. But for the most part, there have been few occasions on which international sanctions have successfully forced a change of heart or policy.  By far the most common form of implementation of human rights standards by states remains traditional bilateral diplomacy. This can extend from oral condemnations through ambassadorial démarches to formal contacts with opposition and human rights organizations. In extreme cases, linkages may be made between A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  17  state policies relating to aid and trade; you will recall for example the case of South Africa, where extensive trade sanctions played a role in the downfall of apartheid. However, such linkages appear to have been lessening, rather than increasing, over the last few years. Recent Canadian governments have in most cases explicitly rejected the linkage of human rights with aid and trade initiatives.  Perhaps, when we hear that people have been deprived of their rights, we should seek to restore them with the help of a fleet of planes or battleships. This would be quick, perhaps; but I have only to say the word “Iraq” to convey the idea that in all probability such “solutions” are not solutions at all—they are simply the prelude to further difficulties.  So how do we bring about the establishment of human rights in nations unable or unwilling to comply with international covenants they may have signed? How can we go about helping the millions of people who are dying of poverty and malnutrition, A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  18  and who may have the misfortune of living in a country like Zimbabwe, where the economy has utterly crumbled, the political system has all but collapsed, and human rights have been put on hold by a President who seems to have lost touch with all the ideals that took him into the political arena thirty years ago?  Zimbabwe offers us a useful example of the helplessness of the world to act in the face of an abuse of “rights”. When other countries have criticized the harshness of the Mugabe regime and pointed to the human rights abuses suffered by Zimbabwean citizens, Mugabe’s response has been to appeal to his followers to stave off interference by Western imperialism disguised as humanitarianism. The human rights invoked by developed nations are denounced as just another Trojan horse, introduced by the West as a means of restoring old colonial values. Meanwhile, people are suffering: according to the UN’s Human Development Report 2007-08, Zimbabwe ranks 91st among 108 developing countries in what is called the “Human Poverty Index”; and in perhaps the most A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  19  chilling statistic, Zimbabweans are listed as having the lowest probability in the world of surviving beyond the age of 40 – yes, 40! The operations of NGOs have for the most part been suspended, and their workers threatened or beaten on the grounds that they were spies. At 2.2 million per cent, inflation is higher in Zimbabwe than anywhere else in the world; until a recent revaluation of the currency, a loaf of bread cost 100 million dollars.  These are the realities facing Zimbabweans. How has the world responded? Largely by expressions of concern—and little more. When Mr. Mugabe went to a conference of African prime ministers earlier this year, there were no repercussions, and precious little public criticism of his policies, by his fellowpoliticians. Yet many African countries are signatories to one or more of the many declarations of support for the fight against poverty and the protection of human rights around the world.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  20  The reason is perhaps obvious: signing a declaration of principles is one thing; implementing those principles is quite another. As soon as one begins to stress implementation rather than simply the articulation of norms, states—no matter what their cultural or ideological roots – feel threatened. This is particularly true in the area of human rights where the mechanisms for implementation remain largely political rather than legal. To appeal to other countries to bring pressure to bear on Zimbabwe is inviting scrutiny of their own situation, and not many countries would necessarily pass muster in a close inspection of this kind.  In other words, an appeal for action grounded in “rights” may not be the most effective way of rousing support for the victims of poverty and hunger.  Instead of broad appeals to universal principles, we may have to look at much simpler, more localized approaches to poverty reduction: the approach favoured, for example, by the Grameen A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  21  Bank in Bangladesh, the bank created by Nobel-prizewinner Mohammed Yunus, who visited UBC last year. The Bank makes small loans to poor people in developing countries so that they may break the cycle of poverty and invest in their own future and the future of their community. In 2007, the bank could boast over seven million users, and claimed a recovery rate of 98%. The bank now operates in over 40 countries, and claims to have lifted millions of people out of the depths of poverty. And it has inspired other banks to follow suit, banks that have discovered that the micro-finance approach can benefit both borrowers and investors.  There is no question that micro-credit can make a very positive difference in the lives of many people; however, there is considerable debate about whether it can make the kinds of lasting inroads into poverty that its proponents promise; and it is also evident that it does little to alter the structural and political  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  22  inequities that bedevil many of the world’s poorer countries.6 Still, it offers a real alternative to the social paralysis engendered by grinding and unremitting poverty.  Like Mohammed Yunus, the United Nations has understood the need to move beyond rhetoric about rights and principles to pragmatic approaches based in concrete action. It addressed the problem in its Millennium Declaration of 2000, out of which emerged the eight “Millennium Development Goals,” goals intended to meet the needs of the world’s poor. The principles enunciated there are familiar—end poverty and hunger, establish universal education and gender equality, and so on; what is different is that the emphasis is on practicality, on setting achievable, time-bound goals. The driving force was thenSecretary-General Kofi Annan’s report to the General Assembly in 2005 urging all members of the United Nations to embrace the  6  See Ian Fraser, “Microfinance comes of age,” Scottish Banker Magazine, 3 August 2007; <http://www.social-capital.net/articles/view.php?viewid=151> Retrieved 14 September 2008.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  23  MDGs, aim to achieve them by 2015, and begin the process immediately by taking a series of concrete steps outlined in the report.  Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger is the first of the Millennium Development goals, and this is presented as a series of specific targets, each divided further into sub-headings. Thus Target 2 is to “Achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people”; this is then marked out as four concrete points to be monitored: --Growth-rate of GDP per person employed --Employment-to-population ratio --Proportion of employed people living below $1 (PPP) per day --Proportion of own-account and contributing family workers in total employment. 7  7  <http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml> Retrieved 14 September 2008.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  24  Both in organization and language, the targets are laid out in business-like fashion—there is none of the rhetorical generality that often characterizes such pronouncements; and to remind us that these goals are to be achieved by 2015, the MDG web-site includes a count-down clock (when I was preparing these remarks, there were 6 years, 142 days, 2 hours, 41 minutes, 20 seconds and counting to the target date!).  In his 2005 Report Secretary-General Annan did not appeal to the notion of “rights” except in the sense of human rights in general. Simply to insist that people have the right to be free of hunger is not, as we have seen, a means of guaranteeing that this right will be made real in real lives. Instead, he looked to the broader concept of international obligation, by which all states would agree to act collectively to stop genocide, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. In the statement accompanying the Report, he focussed upon the principle of the “Responsibility to Protect”; that is, each state has the responsibility of protecting its own citizens A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  25  from such evils, but if the state fails to meet its obligations in this regard, then “the responsibility shifts to the international community.” In the last resort, he concluded, “the United Nations Security Council may take enforcement action according to the Charter.”  This idea was actively promoted by the Canadian government, and has now been adopted as a tenet of foreign policy action by states as diverse as Norway and Korea. But the responsibility to protect has not yet become a binding norm of international law, and the current Canadian government seems to have lost interest in promoting the concept.  Perhaps, if we return for a moment to the situation of the people of Zimbabwe and similar states, there is a case to be made for collective action. Clearly the state is failing to protect its own citizens from abuse, and allowing huge numbers of people to suffer in extremis. All demands that human rights be recognized have A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  26  had no effect. This is perhaps the kind of situation that Annan envisaged when he adopted the language of the “Responsibility to Protect.” However, a problem here is that members of the United Nations are also committed to the principle of a state’s sovereignty, of non-intervention in another state’s internal affairs; violation of that principle creates resistance and political tensions that are just as likely to exacerbate a problem as to solve it. My own view is that we have reached a moment of opportunity in international affairs where, if we keep working hard at normative development, it may just be that sovereignty will cede to the responsibility to protect, at least in the case of massive threats to human life and personal security.  It may be that over time a body of international law will come into force that is based on universally-accepted human rights norms, norms that are accepted by member states and implemented by common agreement within a framework that has real power to exact consequences for non-compliance. But at present A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  27  international legal mechanisms have little force in the attempts to establish and implement human rights. Within some domestic systems of law, international human rights standards find solid support in national legislation and practice, which in turn can lead to relatively effective implementation. But this implementation is haphazard and completely inconsistent between different states; and it remains largely outside the reach of any compulsory international scrutiny.  Many states are parties to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, which does put some teeth into that covenant by allowing a Human Rights Committee to investigate and judge complaints of human rights violations by individuals from countries who are signatories to the protocol. But in the end, the only real consequence even here is the censure of an offender by the court of public opinion—there is no enforceable legal consequence. Organisations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch do much to bring human rights violations to A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  28  the light of public scrutiny, but again there is little that they can do beyond creating public pressure on offending governments.  If I may return one last time to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article One of that document maintains that “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” Indeed, it is in everyone’s interests that we live in a spirit of brotherhood and peace. But as the Dalai Lama reminded us in his Nobel lecture of 1989, “Peace, in the sense of the absence of war, is of little value to someone who is dying of hunger or cold. . . . Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free.”8  If there is to be a solution to the problem of world poverty, it may lie in a combination of all the forces at play: international 8  Nobel lecture, December 11, 1989. <http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1989/lamalecture.html> Retrieved 14 September 2008. A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  29  covenants raising awareness and influencing public opinion; cooperation among many states to exert pressure on those states that abuse human rights; support for improving the governance and legal systems of many states around our globe; a world-wide effort to meet the goals and targets established by the MDG; and promoting a richer interplay of international law and internal legislation—that is, a willingness by the state to shape or change its laws in accordance with international agreements about civil and political rights.  Only when human rights are fully integrated into a nation’s political structure can we be sure that they will be fully protected; only when rights are embedded in the principles by which states govern themselves can they be invoked to drive governments into finding solutions to chronic poverty, malnutrition, and disease. This may be difficult to accomplish in developing nations with weak legal institutions and troubled economies; but here a combination of social action from within, judicious application of A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  30  international aid, and the pressure of legal mechanisms applied by the international community might work together to enable a state to meet its obligations to its own citizens.  The eradication of poverty is a goal to which all states should aspire, because it is the right thing to do — and it is in all our interests. If we succeed, we shall have gone a long way towards establishing the kind of brotherhood among nations that the framers of the UN Charter imagined for a traumatized post-war world. For that reason, even as we recognize the limitations of a rights-based doctrine, we must explore every practical way of helping the poor of the world to realize what is their undoubted right: their right to escape poverty.  Thank you.  A Right to Escape Poverty? 2008 Dr. Richard B. Splane Lecture  31

Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 1  Thank you for that introduction, and good afternoon everyone.  It’s an honour to speak to you today, as it is every year. I take this annual engagement as evidence that the Board of Trade has an inkling of the vital role that UBC plays in the culture, society and economy of Vancouver – indeed, of all British Columbia. I’m here to say that UBC wants to build on your engagement and to deepen our relationship with Vancouverites, and with all British Columbians. I really appreciate your time and interest today.  I also want to thank Fasken Martineau for sponsoring this event. The firm is an unwavering supporter of the UBC Law School and of the university as a whole, for which I am very grateful.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 2  As you may have noticed from the program notes, we are here today in celebration of a birthday – really two birthdays that are closely intertwined. Birthday Number One applies to UBC: we are 100 years old this year.  The second anniversary that we celebrate this year is the sesquicentennial of the Crown colony of British Columbia. I find it almost unimaginable that if we had stood on this spot 150 years ago, we all would have been lost – not to mention inappropriately dressed – in a dense and relatively deserted coastal forest.  It would be nine more years before “Gassy Jack” Deighton built the first saloon near the foot of what is now Granville Street. And yet it would be only 50 years later that the presumptuous leaders of British Columbia decided that they needed their own university.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 3  What a remarkable act of faith – of foresight and good judgment. Because the truth is that they were not just being presumptuous: B.C., by then a young province in a still-new confederation, really did need a university.  Our forebearers needed doctors and bookkeepers, teachers and engineers - - educated people to build a new society. They needed more than they could import from other jurisdictions and more than they could train in the tiny McGill University College that had been set up to answer some of that need.  It took years – in some cases decades – to fill all those demands. The establishment of UBC’s law faculty, for example, would have to wait until after the Second World War. But once established on Point Grey, the new campus grew and thrived – I suspect well beyond the most optimistic dreams of its founders.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 4  If BC needed UBC a hundred years ago, it needs it even more today in a world of shocking economic dislocation, rapid social change, and a growing competition for innovative ideas and educated talent. It’s hard to describe the UBC of today without resorting to the kinds of numerical rankings that often tend to wind up being more trouble than they are worth. If you get too excited about moving up on such lists, other people are apt to get too excited when, for whatever reason, you find yourself slipping down.  By the way, there is no hint of sour grapes in that observation. I am proud to say that UBC keeps climbing up the international rankings. But I don’t want to tie our fortunes to a particular rank or number. Instead, I will say this:  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 5  In Canada, there are a handful of medical doctoral universities that are consistently judged to be of the highest standard – and UBC is in the top of this rarified group.  In North America, there is a similarly small group that effectively transfer knowledge into industry – 10 or so universities counted among the highest performers in the Milken Institute’s Technology Transfer and Commercialization Index. In addition to being the only Canadian university in the top tier, UBC also became the first institution in Canada – in the 2006-2007 academic year – to break the $100-million mark in cumulative licensing revenue.  That’s more than $100 million dollars that has poured back into public education in British Columbia because of discoveries made and licensed by our brilliant researchers at UBC.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 6  In the world, there is another, even more exclusive group: three dozen or so globally influential research intensive universities, and UBC is consistently counted among these, as well. Only one other Canadian university is routinely in that group – it is in a big, cold city to our east. So UBC is an utterly unique resource for BC, in a different category completely than the other strong and important sister universities in our province.  What does that mean on the ground? What does it mean to Vancouverites and British Columbians?  Well, for starters, UBC is an economic powerhouse in its own right. It is the third-largest employer in the Lower Mainland, with more than 9,800 full-time equivalent employees – the overwhelming majority of whom have well-paid, interesting and highly productive jobs. That’s why UBC keeps appearing on lists of BC’s top employers.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 7  UBC’s direct expenditures total $1.4 billion. Add the standard multiplier and the spending of students and visitors and you have a direct economic impact – in the Lower Mainland alone – of nearly $2.2 billion.  And that’s not counting the effect of companies that are started by UBC graduates or that spin off directly from UBC discoveries. It also overlooks the value-added component that every UBC graduate who stays in BC brings into the workforce.  The numbers are not as big on the new UBC Okanagan campus, but there is no question of the transformative effect that UBC is having in Kelowna. I was there last week with the Premier for a sod turning for three new buildings, a $74-million Engineering and Management building, a $42-million Arts and Sciences building and a $33-million Health Sciences Centre.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 8  These are part of a $350-million capital plan – an incredible investment in Kelowna, in education and in the future of British Columbia. Of course, this investment would not be possible without our partnership with the provincial government. Premier Campbell’s government has invested wisely in UBC - - and UBC is delivering on that investment.  The third building that we set in motion in Kelowna last week – the Health Sciences Centre –points to UBC’s broader influence in the province. Thanks to a timely investment by the provincial government in 2003, UBC has, in the last five years, doubled the number of physicians being trained in British Columbia – we now produce 256 new doctors every year.  Already working in collaboration with the University of Victoria and the University of Northern B.C., we will soon be  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 9  adding the Southern Medical Programme at UBC Okanagan. The effect is to encourage more graduating students to enter general practice in all regions of BC. This is a benefit beyond measure for hundreds of communities outside the Lower Mainland.  We have undergraduate and graduate trainees in Terrace, Hazleton, Fort Saint John, Prince George, Kamloops, Kelowna, Penticton, Nelson, throughout the Fraser Valley and all the way up Vancouver Island, from Nanaimo and Comox to Port McNeil and Port Hardy.  Back in Vancouver, I hardly know where to start. This year, we have 43,600 full and part-time domestic students and 5,600 international students. The latter add immeasurably to the intellectual and cultural fabric of UBC and of BC.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 10  These international students are among the best in the world, recruited to UBC for undergraduate and graduate work. Some will stay in Canada as top contributors to our society and our economy. I have met young engineering graduates who are now BC-based entrepreneurs; science grads who are contributing to discoveries in BC’s biotech industry. Other international students – many others – will make lifelong friends and connections here, but return home, extending B.C.’s social linkages and commercial alliances to the far reaches of the globe. I meet them all the time in Korea and China, in India and Germany.  Being among the best institutions in the world means we can also attract the best faculty. There was a great, short article earlier this year in the U.S. Chronicle of Higher Education, under the headline: “A Harvard sociologist heads for the Great White North.”  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 11  The article began: “One of America’s notable sociologists … is about to take part in a faculty trend that might be worthy of analysis in its own right: He’s moving to the University of British Columbia.”  “Like a growing number of professors at elite American institutions, Neil Gross, 36, an assistant professor of sociology at Harvard University, has answered Canada’s call. This fall he will join the sociology department at British Columbia as a tenured professor.”  The article went on to complain that more than two dozen top U.S. academics had moved to UBC in the last while. These would include people like Dr. Judy Illes, whom we recruited from Stanford, where she was an Associate Professor of Pediatrics and a program director in the Stanford Center for Medical Bioethics. Earlier this month, Judy opened what we call the National Core for  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 12  Neuroethics, which at this point is the most advanced centre for the study of neuroethics in the world. Neuroethics asks the hardest questions imaginable about how to approach brain research and clinical treatment from ethical viewpoints.  We were also delighted in the past year to welcome Dr. Michael Krausz. Trained at the University of Berlin, Dr. Krausz is a world authority on addiction treatment and especially on the implications of dual diagnoses of addiction and mental illness. He is now the first Leading Edge Endowment Fund Chair in Addiction Research and a clinical researcher at St. Paul’s Hospital. The Leading Edge Chairs are a welcome provincial investment in research.  When he first arrived, Dr. Krausz said he was tempted by the strength of UBC, but equally engaged by the challenge and the opportunity that he sees in the Downtown Eastside. He is  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 13  committed to making a difference in this community – to bringing to bear the best psychiatric and medical knowledge in the world in the effort to come to grips with drug use, crime, homelessness and mental illness in Vancouver’s most fragile neighbourhood. Dr. Krausz is already leading the charge in promoting collaborative action amongst doctors, social workers, police, and youth workers in the Downtown Eastside.  There can hardly be a better example of the potential effect of having a globally influential university on your doorstop.  But there are other examples, many that once again bring direct economic benefit to the community. UBC has produced a cumulative total of 129 spin-off companies, 95 per cent of which are BC-based. These companies have collectively generated more than $4 billion in sales and 40,000 employment years.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 14  A recent example, the company Galvanox began as a mathematical modeling exercise in basic research. Now it promotes a promising new copper leaching process that is nearing its first commercial field test. The technology dramatically reduces pollution and emissions during the on-site refining of concentrated copper, with the first license being issued to a BC-based copper mining company.  I’m proud to say that four of the eleven National Centres of Excellence in commercialization created by the federal government this year are at UBC: The Centre for Drug Research and Development, linking basic research to clinical drug applications; the Centre for the Prevention of Epidemic Organ Failure; the Prostate Centre’s Translational Research Initiative for Accelerated Discovery and Development; and Advanced Applied Physics Solutions, Inc., which is attached to the TRIUMF particle collider on the UBC campus.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 15  I have been concentrating on bio-tech, biomedical and high tech issues, but I want to emphasise that there are many initiatives that may seem less high-flown, but that are already having an impact, economically and environmentally.  There was a great new one reported in the papers last week. A UBC spin-off called Ostara has just won a $2.5-million contract with a Portland suburb to draw high quality chemical fertilizer from liquid sewage. The process helps to purify the community’s waste water and at the same time generates a product that will enable the town to recover its investment in five years.  This technology is not central to UBC’s reputation for sustainability, but it leads directly to that topic. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sustainability Endowments Institute creates an annual College Sustainability Report Card, and this year, UBC was the only Canadian school to score the top mark accorded to  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 16  any university in North America, where it ranked within the top 15.  We were congratulated for things like our administrative commitment to sustainability, for our local food and recycling programs, for our green buildings, for transportation initiatives that have reduced campus car trips, and for a massive retrofit that lowered our use of energy and water and our output in sewage.  I know, though, that the work of people like John Robinson and the Centre for Sustainable Cities has also captured people’s attention. I know in part because the UN Secretary General invited me to a conference in New York last spring as one of only 20 university presidents from around the world gathered to talk about sustainability. During the conference, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, a guest speaker, singled UBC out as one of three universities that he described as “sustainability leaders.”  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 17  I would not want to leave you with the impression that research only matters when it leads to direct applications in health care or sustainability, or to corporate spin-offs. One of the reasons that UBC is now globally known - - bringing notice to BC - - is our fundamental research. By that I mean research that promotes understanding and knowledge without a clear idea where it may lead. For instance, Prof. Luciana Duranti is leading a global research effort dedicated to ensuring that the digital records we generate today – including medical records, bank balances, legal documents and insurance policies – will remain accessible as technologies rapidly advance. Digital records form the foundation of our computer-driven society, and this basic investigation seeks to establish methods and produce guidelines for preserving accurate and authentic digital records over the long term.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 18  As I mentioned, UBC is working hard to build a more sustainable community on our Vancouver Campus. We are increasing the opportunity for people to live near their work, and minimizing traffic throughout the city. And on that count, we have, in the past 10 years, increased transit ridership by 185 per cent, and reduced car trips by 14 per cent, even as the UBC population grew by nearly one-third. That achievement is unmatched anywhere in Canada.  The goal is to create a vital, lively, healthy – and sustainable – community where people can work and learn and shop and play, where they can walk or take transit easily, and where most of what they need is readily at hand. We’re also working to ensure we plan to keep these developments to a high standard, while retaining a level of modesty and scale that will make them affordable for staff, faculty and students of UBC. Already, 65 per cent of the people who live in the neighbourhoods on our campus work or study at  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 19  UBC, and this does not count the occupants of our student residences.  I know that there is some frustration amongst our neighbours with truck traffic and some fear of physical change on the campus. I know because I get buttonholed on these subjects all the time! But I urge doubters to take a longer view, to join us in imagining what we already see as the time when UBC on Point Grey will be a demonstration of sustainable living, with an exciting community that attracts the best students in the world living side-by-side with people who value performances at the Chan and the Freddie Wood; who visit the Belkin Gallery, the Museum of Anthropology, and our soon-to-open Beaty Biodiversity Museum; who hike through Pacific Spirit Park and the Botanical Gardens; who want to contribute to urban agriculture at the UBC Farm; and who enjoy living with neighbours who come from across Canada and around the world.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 20  Now, I could frighten those of you who are thinking about getting back to the office by saying there is much more to come. I could, for example, segue from what a great university like UBC can do for this community, to what UBC needs in return.  I could worry aloud about funding, saying that even though we administer more than $150 million in loans, grants and bursaries, almost three quarters of our students end their fourth year with an average debt load of $22,000.  I could talk about the indirect costs of research – the heating, lighting and office-space kinds of expenses that are funded to an average level of 60 per cent for our competitors south of the border and only at 20 per cent in Canada.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 21  I could complain that tuition does not yet meet enough of the real cost of a student’s education. This is especially true of the professional schools: Sauder, law, medicine, etc. In all the research that has been done, the cost of tuition has far less impact on access than the availability of well-designed student aid. For some people, the idea of significant debt may be a deal breaker, and that is why we are working with governments to try to change the way we support Canadian students.  Students in the professional schools understand well the value of their degree and they are sometimes willing to invest more if it means we can raise the quality of their education. Students in the Sauder School of Business, for example, actually voted last year by an overwhelming majority to raise their own fees in order to pay for improvements that they believed would help UBC attract and retain even better professors and the very best students. They  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 22  were disappointed – and a little surprised – when the provincial government rejected their appeal.  In finishing out my potential list of worries, I could end with something – perhaps predictable – about the importance of supporting education and research in tight economic times. How now, more than ever, we need a well-educated populace and a steady stream of innovation.  It’s all true.  But I think it is more appropriate simply to say thank you, to the federal government for its investment in research – and in indirect costs. Thank you to the provincial government which provides the majority of direct funding for students and which continues to support vital capital projects such as the three new UBC Okanagan buildings for which we turned sod only last week.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 23  Thank you to UBC alumni – which I know includes many of you in this room. You are our most important resource, our best ambassadors and our greatest supporters. We have been working diligently in the last three years to improve our alumni communications – to ensure that you know everything you need to know about what’s happening on campus, and some things you just might want to know as well. We must continue to work even harder to improve our engagement with our own graduates.  In closing, I want to reaffirm how proud and amazed I am at what UBC has accomplished in 100 years. I am inspired by what it has accomplished even in the two years since I arrived to take over as President. That’s a short time. I can still see with the eyes of an outsider – I can still marvel at that which Vancouverites are at risk of taking for granted.  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 24  Let me conclude on that note. I came here to UBC because I know that UBC is one of the world’s leading research universities. It is producing discoveries and innovations that advance human understanding and that make our world a better place. UBC is also a magnet for talent, helping to retain our most gifted students here in BC, and attracting bright and ambitious young people from across Canada and around the world. UBC is also a connector - linking new ideas and best practices into our local communities, and bridging Vancouver and the Okanagan to global networks of innovation. I worry that Vancouverites may be a little blasé about UBC. Please don’t overlook this great resource in your backyard.  Instead, I invite each and every one of you to engage with UBC. We are here to serve – and the evidence suggests we serve well. Call us, use us. Send us your best students and your most intractable problems. Hire our graduates and – please, please –  Vancouver Board of Trade September 29, 2008; Page 25  support our research. And urge others to support us as well. Come and visit our astonishing campuses.  Despite the economic uncertainty that hangs in the air today, I believe that Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada remain incredibly well-placed to leap into this new century, to show leadership in the world. Our unique, globally influential, research university is crucial for us in making that leap. With your support, UBC can make this, our second century, even better than the first.  Thank you.  
1.0107492~2006 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2006 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President, The University of British Columbia  22-23 November 2006 I  1  I am at the other end of the learning curve from all you graduates. I am just beginning my life at UBC. Having been here in Vancouver for four and three-quarter months now, I can’t quite call myself new anymore, but I sure can’t claim to be experienced. You graduates, on the other hand are all old-timers. You have successfully weeded your way through long hours of study, through the challenges and rewards of new friendships, through the inevitable frustrations of dealing with a large institution. You are the experts in the room. So it seems a little presumptuous for me to be up here at the podium. But I am the President of UBC, so I really must say something.  Rather than presume to share my thoughts on what this occasion might mean to you our wonderful graduates, I hope you will forgive me if I step into another role, that of a parent, and reflect upon what this day means to a person who is lucky enough to have a child. Don’t get me wrong, I am not speaking on behalf of all the parents in this great Chan Centre. Our relationships as parents and children are far too varied and far too complex for me to capture all the emotions that are floating around today. No, I simply want to reflect for a few moments on what a graduation means to this parent – one whose  2  children are still too young to have graduated. This speech is a way of preparing for how I might feel when I am sitting in a room like this watching one of my children cross the stage as a university graduate. For those of you watching a father or mother cross the stage, I invite you to join me in my little thought experiment!  Like so many family occasions, this one prompts me to think back a generation or two. It is important for me to set that stage by telling you that I am adopted. So I don’t actually know whether or not I come from a long line of university graduates – I suspect not. But I do know that my wonderful adoptive father was the first person in his Newfoundland family to attend a university, and that my adoptive mother had to leave high school in Montreal to work to support her family when my grandfather lost his job because of illness. So, like so many of you in this room, I have a profound sense of how precious a university education is, how it builds a sense of obligation to give back in some way.  Which brings me to what it is that this particular university, the University of British Columbia, hopes to draw out from our students  3  and from you graduates. I am sure that you have all heard that UBC aspires to graduate what we call “exceptional global citizens”.  I must admit that when I first heard that goal, taken from our Trek 2010 vision statement, I was a little taken aback. As an international lawyer, as a person who has spent his whole career promoting international norms, and as a committed participant in various United Nations initiatives in the protection and promotion of human rights, I could be expected to rally round the concept of “global citizenship”. But from the beginning, I have experienced a slight discomfort with the phrase. With just a little bit of thought I came to recognize why. It was the obvious association of the term “global citizenship” with the prevalent and typically uncritical invocation of the term “globalization”.  In speaking of our goal to promote global citizenship and a global role for the university, we must not be constrained by the rhetoric of globalization. Yes, global market opportunities are greater than ever, as is global economic competition. But global citizenship is about more than looking for exciting jobs in Hong Kong, London or New York. It is about more than building-up BC and Canada’s  4  international trade. It must be about something different than recolonizing the world though global citizens who are merely agents of economic domination.  As a parent, as one who hopes to see his own children become global citizens, I want to rescue the concept of global citizenship from the rhetoric of globalization.  The notion of global citizenship is far from new. Its earliest expression is to be found in the words of the Greek cynic philosopher Diogenes, who described himself as a cosmopolite—literally, a citizen of the world.1 Of course, the known world was a much smaller place in the 4th century BC, but I think we can interpret Diogenes’ remark to mean much the same today as it meant in his time: that to be a citizen of the world is to be one who defies the narrow boundaries of nationalism; who is free of the prejudices such a nationalism might impose; who has some understanding of other peoples, other nations, other languages, other cultures and traditions different from one’s own.  5  Diogenes, speaking as a philosopher, is making a further claim, that the world of ideas cannot be hedged in by time or place, and that the intellect must seek inspiration and truth from as broad a range of influences and experiences as possible. This idea inspired philosopher Immanuel Kant as well, whose commitment to “cosmopolitanism” links directly to a thoughtful contemporary commitment to global citizenship. Freedom of intellectual inquiry and openness to diverse influences: these insights of Diogenes and Kant are as important today as they were 2400 years ago or two centuries ago; indeed one might say that the rational search for knowledge across all boundaries is the very raison d’etre of the university. As learners and scholars, consciously or unconsciously, we lay claim to the rights and freedoms of global citizenship because without that breadth of vision, without the capacity or willingness to benefit from the world of ideas and diverse practices we cannot hope to make any meaningful contributions ourselves.  As a citizen, one enjoys the kind of rights and protections that membership in a society will confer; but one also has a duty to ensure that others enjoy those same rights and protections, and that entails  6  action—political action; community action; and social action. To be a citizen is almost the antithesis of being a consumer – it is active, not passive.  It is true, as I suggested earlier, that in certain respects the language of global citizenship and the rhetoric of globalization overlap. Both seek the overturning of traditional barriers that separate peoples, nations, or governments; both proclaim the value of a new internationalism stressing cross-cultural collaboration; both speak to the need to transcend boundaries and borders, whether commercial, cultural, or intellectual. But global citizenship—at least, as I have been using the term—goes much further than this, because it is motivated by something other than the desire for profit or the will to power: it is sustained by a recognition that, as moral beings, we must help one another; that endowed as we are with conscience and intelligence, we cannot turn our backs on those who are less fortunate than ourselves without in some way compromising ourselves and denying our common humanity. In the powerful words of W. H. Auden, we must love one another, or die.  7  So as a parent, looking at all the graduates who are about to cross this stage, I am filled with hope. A couple of months ago, I asked some UBC students what they thought was meant by “global citizenship”. Here’s what they answered: It means caring and acting. Caring about our fellow citizens right here in Vancouver. Caring about the challenges faced by our fellows in all parts of the world. Acting by making choices in our own lives that support respect for others and fairness in resource consumption. Acting by working in solidarity with our neighbours, by volunteering in the Downtown Eastside, like over 1000 UBC students did last year. Acting politically as well through NGO campaigns, through political parties and through global initiatives for change.  Yes, it is simple. Caring and acting: I could not find a better definition of global citizenship in any learned tome. But I have to add one further component: in between caring and acting comes learning. Learning in classrooms and in labs; learning from those friendships with people from many different backgrounds that enrich the life of a student at a great university; learning from the challenges and trials that we all face in the transition from childhood to  8  adulthood; learning, I hope, as a part of every day for the rest of our lives. Learning gives us knowledge, skills and approaches that help us turn caring into acting. That is why universities are such fundamental social institutions; they instill the discipline of learning and they help equip us to be citizens. At UBC, I hope that the diversity you have discovered, the friendships you have made, the teachers who have inspired you, and the sheer discovery of your own potential will help lead you graduates down a path to global citizenship, to caring and acting in ways that will benefit all of humankind – starting right at home. Good luck to you all!  Oh…and I hope that we parents can take a moment to experience the thrill -- and the sheer hopefulness -- of seeing children now taking on the roles of responsible, caring adults; adults who have learned what it takes to make a difference in our world. Congratulations to you all. Thank you. 1  Diogenes Laertius: Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (1925) translated by R. D. Hicks (Loeb Classical Library).  9  
1.0107467~2007 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2007 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President, University of British Columbia  21-22 November 2007  1  I hope that all of you graduates are feeling a sense of deep satisfaction today. You deserve it. Congratulations really are in order; all those hard choices of classes, difficult assignments, hairraising exams – they are behind you. Well done!  But I also hope that you are feeling a little uncertain too. I hope that you don’t think that a big hurdle being crossed, you are now on the race to the finish line. Life has a habit of kicking up surprises – some of them wonderful and some of them heartbreaking. All that any of us can ask is that when the opportunities come our way, or the problems mount, we have found or created the internal resources needed to handle them as best we can. We can’t make uncertainty go away. We can’t take the risk out of life.  For me, one of the greatest models of a how to seize opportunity and to handle defeat is Abe Lincoln. He has fascinated me for a long time, ever since in grade nine I had to memorize the 2  Gettysburg Address. You know… “Four score and seven years ago…”.  Last year I read a marvelous Lincoln biography by Doris Kearns Goodwin. It is called “Team of Rivals” and I recommend it highly. Many of us probably know the outlines of Lincoln’s career. Brought up in the backwoods of Illinois with almost no formal education. A self-taught country lawyer. Unexpectedly became President of the United States when he slid up the middle of a split vote at the Republican Convention of 1860. At first a cautious opponent of only some elements of slavery, he became a committed foe. Finally, he had to lead his country through a bloody civil war. At his moment of triumph he is assassinated in Ford’s theatre by a disaffected Confederate loyalist.  Even the outline is a great and moving story. But delve down a little deeper and there is so much more to learn. Of course, being  3  beneficiaries of a university education, you already know that. Dig deeper in any subject and there is always more to learn.  Abe Lincoln was not a conventionally happy man. He grew up poor in a tough environment. He was notoriously clumsy with women. His marriage was troubled; his wife chronically disturbed. He lost his first bids at election as an Illinois congressman. His young son, Eddie, died from tuberculosis in 1850. Later, during some of the most difficult days of the civil war, when it still looked like the Union would fail, Lincoln lost a second son, Willie, to typhoid fever. Lincoln felt the burden office during the war to a frightful extent; he was constantly described as having the saddest face imaginable.  And yet. And yet… Lincoln was also a brilliant and consistently humorous raconteur. He loved the theatre and found great solace in immersing himself in plays. He was capable of the deepest friendships. Above all, he inspired loyalty – even, or perhaps 4  especially, among those people who began by discounting or even despising him. That quality is what I want to focus upon today. The quality of leadership that Lincoln possessed. We can’t all be Abe Lincolns. Perhaps none of us will ever be tested in the ways he was tested. But we can learn from his ability to inspire loyalty and friendship.  Here is my starting proposition: that Lincoln cared more for respect than for honour. In his own words, at the age of only 23: Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition…Whether it be true or not, I can say for one that I have no other [ambition] so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow[s]…by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. Throughout his life, Lincoln sought to do the right thing as far as he could determine it. He was a person of principle who was also exquisitely forthright. Hence the nickname: Honest Abe.  Lincoln was also a deeply generous person who readily forgave the foibles and mistakes of others. In his Second Inaugural Address,  5  when he could have basked in the glory of the Union victory, his approach was entirely different. He proclaimed that his government would treat the South with magnanimity and respect. In his famous phrase: “With malice toward none, with charity for all.” Some historians have argued that if Lincoln had survived, the post-war treatment of the South by the United States government would likely have been generous enough to heal the wounds that later opened up with such negative power during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  We can never know. But what is clear is that Lincoln’s magnanimity was not mere rhetoric, for Lincoln acted the same way in his personal relationships. Even when others treated him shabbily, and were disloyal, he remained understanding. He knew that humans were imperfect creatures who could let their own interests cloud their judgment.  6  The best example is his relationship with Salmon Chase, a man who ran against Lincoln for the Republican nomination in 1860. As he did with all his other rivals, Lincoln put Chase in his Cabinet. A brilliant move. But Chase was proud, haughty and ambitious. All through Lincoln’s first term, Chase conspired to steal the nomination from Lincoln for the 1864 election. Not only did Lincoln keep Chase in the cabinet, though confronting him with his disloyalty, Lincoln ultimately appointed Chase to be Chief Justice of the United States – simply because Lincoln thought that Chase was the best person for the job. In so doing, Lincoln had to overlook three close friends and advisors who each sought the Chief Justiceship.  In this story, we see not only Lincoln’s generosity of spirit, and his commitment to principled decision-making, we also see his ability to assess motives and to find the ways to draw out the best in those around him. When the opponents of Chase’s nominations angrily confronted Lincoln, this was his reply: 7  Now I know meaner things about …Chase than any of those men can tell me, [but] we have stood together in the time of trial, and I should despise myself if I allowed personal differences to affect my judgment of his fitness for the office. (pp. 679-80)  Lincoln’s judgment was sound. Soon after his appointment, Chase led the Supreme Court in effectively overturning one of the most ignominious decisions in the Court’s history – the infamous Dred Scott case wherein the Court had determined in 1856 that a slave could not sue for his freedom. Chase presided over the swearingin of a black lawyer to practice before the Supreme Court: a symbolic reversal of the old slave practices that could not have been more powerful.  Delving into the story of Abe Lincoln points to three ways of looking at our opportunities in the world that I find helpful. First, that we should not be afraid of principled decision-making. Weathering dissent, rejecting the mere currying of favour, does not make one a chump; it shows enormous strength. Second, that 8  adopting a magnanimous stance in the face of human frailty is likewise not a sign of weakness but of confidence. Third, that magnanimity can also help one to draw out the best in human motivation, encouraging people to believe that they have the will and the ability to accomplish difficult goals.  These approaches to life engender respect; and that is worth far more than wealth, position, titles and honours.  Now none of this is new, of course. Lincoln’s approach to leadership has been described in different cultures for millennia. From Taoism and Confucionism to Christianity, the concept of “servant leadership” has been a thread in many religious traditions. But Lincoln shows us that the same strand is present in powerful secular traditions as well. This great theme of history is by no means exhausted. We find the same threads of principle, magnanimity and seeking the best in human motivation in our own day in people like Nelson Mandela. This tradition of leadership is 9  alive, if bruised and buffeted by the excesses of some self-serving and unprincipled so-called leaders the world over.  So on this day of great achievement. On this day when you are justly honoured by your family and community, I hope that you graduates will remember Lincoln’s words: “I have no other [ambition] so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow[s]”. That challenge is great, but the rewards are unmeasured. Thank you.  10  
1.0107500~2010 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2010 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  24-26 November 2010  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2010.  What a wonderful day for all of you graduates. Congratulations -- you’ve made it! Perhaps you are surprised by that. After all, most, if not all of you, have managed to fulfill the requirements of your degree despite that most common of human impulses, procrastination. Am I right? Don’t try to tell me that you always got a good night’s sleep before that exam had to be written, or that you always had days to spare before having to hand in that term paper! Study after study shows that students are chronic procrastinators. But the good news for you is that now that you are graduates, the procrastination can continue. Study after study shows that humans are chronic procrastinators! I want to suggest that we can turn that vice into a virtue.  Yes, I admit it. I procrastinate too. As I was writing this speech, I just could not resist my youngest daughter’s invitation to watch a little bit of the first Harry Potter movie. Well, you see, the latest one was about to be released, and I just had to remind myself of how Harry, Hermione and Ron had looked when they were 11 or so. By the way, I have seen that first Harry Potter movie at least seven times over the last decade.  In a marvelous review of the recent academic literature on procrastination, The New Yorker’s James Surowiecki explains that we should not confuse procrastination with other, seemingly related, impulses. You are not a 2  procrastinator if you simply don’t care about obligations, if you always live for the moment. That just makes you selfish or irresponsible. Nor are you a procrastinator if you delay on purpose because you think you have a better use for your time. No, “[t]he essence of procrastination lies in not doing what you think you should be doing, a mental contortion that surely accounts for the great psychic toll the habit takes on people.” (Surowiecki, 2010).  There are many competing explanations for procrastination. Economists like Nobel-winner George Akerlof say that procrastination reveals the limits of rationality. Since the time of the Greeks, philosophers have accepted the lack of rationality in procrastination: even if it seems that one is avoiding an unpleasant or difficult task, delaying actually makes most people unhappy, and the consequences can be decidedly negative. I hope that none of you was ever docked a grade for handing in something late.  For me, the most intriguing recent explanation of procrastination comes from game theorist Thomas Schelling who suggests that delaying what we know we must do reflects a “divided self”: the person who plans and the person who fails to deliver are but different parts of a complex personality. We want to plan and to fulfill our obligations, but we also want to delay and do things that seem to provide more immediate gratification. But just because we may be internally divided, with different styles and approaches battling themselves out within ourselves, this does not mean that we are doomed to the real negatives of procrastination: failure to achieve and guilt. 3  In a fascinating paper in a collection called The Thief of Time, Joseph Heath and Joel Anderson suggest that merely trying to address the problem of procrastination with our own internal resources may not be adequate to the task: there are reasons to doubt that "simply buckling down" will be enough to solve many pathologies of the will – or, indeed, that it ever has been enough. To begin with, there are many unanswered empirical questions about how such self-discipline is possible and what the limits of it are. Several recent studies suggest that although willpower is like a muscle, and can be trained, it can also become exhausted. So in addition to willpower, Heath and Anderson suggest that we humans need to rely on external tools and techniques that help us to do what we know we need to do, what they call “the extended will.” A great example is a software programme designed by a PhD candidate at the University of North Carolina in 2008. It enables users to shut off their access to the internet for up to eight hours: It is called “Freedom”! You may want to try it.  So, my friends, you will likely have to exercise more willpower now that you have graduated. Missing deadlines at work or in a family can have consequences far more severe than missing deadlines at university. You may also want to look for external techniques to help create an “extended will.”  4  But what if you still end up procrastinating? I have a suggestion. Make sure that you don’t procrastinate by relying on junk. Don’t sit in front of the television watching the latest episode of “Survivor Samoa”. Don’t just wash your hair or clip your finger nails (though you should do both regularly!). Instead, take your procrastination and appreciate something beautiful in the world. I say this, because the inverse of procrastination – another part of our complex personalities – is our tendency to focus so much on goals (even ones we are procrastinating about!) that we overlook the wonder around us.  Consider these lovely words of young American poet Todd Boss (Boss, 2010):  ONE CAN MISS MOUNTAINS And pine. One can dismiss a whisper’s revelations and go on as before as if everything were perfectly fine. One does. One loses wonder 5  among stores of things. One can even miss the basso boom of the ocean’s rumpus room and its rhythm. A man can leave this earth And take nothing --Not even longing – along with him.  So on this day of graduation, I encourage you to do two things now and in the future. First, try not to procrastinate, and find ways of helping yourself avoid it. Second, if you must procrastinate, and you do, do it with beauty. Congratulations and good luck!

1.0107511~Imagine UBC Vancouver~Toope, Stephen J.~Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  O Canada. It’s a beautiful anthem, isn’t it? I think it practically qualifies as a ‘pop’ song now, thanks to Mark Donnelly. Nobody sings it like him. No one else has ever made it cool for us all to sing along the way he has. And we do! Most of us know all the words … and you international students will soon learn them. Do you remember, by any chance, when you first learned the words to “O Canada?” Maybe you were actually living somewhere else in the world, and heard them on television, maybe even during the Olympics. Maybe you were in the process of becoming a Canadian citizen. Or maybe you were six years old when you first learned those words, sitting cross-legged on the floor of your elementary school gymnasium with what seemed like thousands of other kids, half excited, half scared, everything new, nothing familiar—your very first student assembly. Words. They’re funny things. Some words, the more you use them, the less they mean. Like “awesome,” or “synergy,” or “like, whatever.” Other  Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Page 2 of 6  words, like the lyrics to “O Canada,” take on new and deeper layers of meaning the longer you live with them. Two such words, words that I think may be among the most powerful in the English language, are IMAGINE and CREATE. Why? Simple answer, really: Because that’s what we’re here to do. And I don’t just mean today; I mean for the whole of your university career. Some might even say it’s what we’re here to do with our lives. Imagination and creation may be the only two skills we’re born with, that we don’t need to be taught or trained how to use. Your parents unpack the new 22-inch TV, you spot the empty carton and see … a race car. They can’t afford the Barbie Dream House® so you make one out of shoeboxes and toilet paper rolls. The park next to your school is a magic forest. Your back porch is a Broadway stage. You write stories, rehearse shows, play in a band, draft plans, build forts, train every morning at dawn, look at the world through a microscope, the universe through a telescope, build a car from the engine up, shoot movies, learn codes and languages, invent iPhone apps … all to get … here. To IMAGINE. To CREATE. We call this first day at UBC “IMAGINE” in Vancouver, and “CREATE” in the Okanagan. The names signify that here, at this extra-ordinary time in your  Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Page 3 of 6  life, you’re about to put your skills into practice at a whole new level. The two events have different names because you can’t have one without the other. Picture it: Imagination without creation stays forever in the realm of fantasy. It leads to frustration. And creation without imagination lacks vision and forethought and power. It leads to mediocrity. But together, they are the foundation of every triumph, great or small, that humankind has ever achieved. So how do you get from IMAGINATION to CREATION? Well, for me, it’s a short flight on a very small airplane. For you, the answer is … play. That’s right: play. Surprised? You thought I was going to say “hard work,” didn’t you? Well, that starts next week. Psychologist Carl Jung said, “The creative mind plays with the object it loves.” Today is a reminder to follow your passions during these next few years—in the classes you choose, the clubs you join, the questions you ask, the people you meet, and the new ideas and perspectives you make your own. To the degree that the hard work of the next few years becomes play, you will find yourself able to take what you imagine and make it real in the physical world. Let me say that again: You will be able to take what you imagine and make it real. It sounds like magic, doesn’t it?  Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Page 4 of 6  You might be wondering at this point what a university president is doing talking about play and imagination and creation and magic. Maybe you’re asking yourself, Is this a West Coast thing? Should I have gone to U of T after all? But before the future engineers and physicists and commerce students get too worried, let me share just a few more powerful words from some other powerful voices: Physicist Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Business leader Peter Drucker said, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” World-renowned educator Sir Ken Robinson said, “Creativity is as important as literacy.” And artist Pablo Picasso said, “Everything you can imagine is real.” What university is for, this university in particular, is to give your mind every opportunity to play with the objects it loves. Ideas, theories, questions, problems, philosophies, blueprints, equations, formulae, stories, symptoms, statistics, songs. We call UBC “a place of mind” and a world of worlds is about to open up for your mind to play with. So dream big! Today is meant to give you a taste of what you might yet create if only you let your imagination loose. Look around you! This is your playground, and all of  Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Page 5 of 6  us are your co-creators. These people will inform your ideas, challenge your ideals, and change your mind. You will do the same for us. When I was your age, a young man wrote a song about coming together to imagine a better world. All these decades later  it is still the anthem, the “O Canada” for all those of us who are committed to creating that world. You probably know the words: Imagine all the people Living life in peace ... Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people Sharing all the world In whatever your chosen area of study, in whatever your chosen field of work … imagine that. Choose that. Create that. I wish you every success with your studies, and look forward to the day we’re all together again, upon your graduation. Welcome to the University of British Columbia.  Imagine UBC Vancouver 6 September 2011 Page 6 of 6  [pause for applause] And now, I am pleased to introduce to you your Alma Mater Society President, Mr. Jeremy McElroy.  
1.0107496~2011 Spring Convocation Address [UBC Okanagan campus]~Toope, Stephen J.~2011 Spring Convocation Address  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  June 9 – 10, 2011 Kelowna, British Columbia  Madam Chancellor, Distinguished Colleagues, Honoured Guests, Members of the UBC Graduating Class of 2011. You graduates are finishing your degree studies at an auspicious time. You are part of the largest graduating class in our history, and over the next few weeks, we will finish all the building projects that you have been living through for years! So I want to say congratulations to each and every one of you, and congratulations to UBCO. I want to take a few moments to explore three things that I expect you graduates share with your university: ambition, balance and community. The ambition is obvious. You would not have made it to this day were it not for your decision, made a few years ago, but reaffirmed on an almost daily basis since then, to try your hardest, to work to increase your store of knowledge, your skills and your opportunities for the future. To finish a serious programme of studies and to reach this happy day is a real achievement, but it is also a signal of your continuing ambition to make something of yourself and to make a difference in the world. UBC’s Okanagan campus shares that ambition. When this great adventure was conceived only six or so years ago, it was because a group of forward thinking leaders in this community worked with UBC leaders and the province to create a university to serve young people and life-long learners in the valley, while also creating a research environment to attract talent and help to transform the future of the economy in the Okanagan. The ambition has already taken root and grown in the rich earth with which we are blessed.  2  You have also worked hard to achieve a balance in your lives as students. Of course there has been hard work, some late nights, and serious academic commitments fulfilled. But you have also thrived in clubs, in athletics, and in community service. You have been the builders of this lively community. Thank you. UBC in the Okanagan has also worked hard to create a balance between our fundamental goal of providing a rich undergraduate education and our great success in attracting outstanding graduate students. Our graduate programme is already much bigger and more diversified than we imagined possible only five years ago. We are also balancing service to the local community and our already remarkable ability to serve as a magnet for dynamic young people and experienced professionals from across Canada and around the world. We are strengthening the existing talent pool and expanding it enormously at one and the same time. UBC is also balancing the independent identity of this campus against the strengths that participation in a bigger system can produce. This is both the Okanagan version of UBC and UBC itself, with incredible resources and a global reputation for excellence. Finally, you graduates know that you could not have succeeded entirely on your own. You rely on the support and encouragement of your parents, family and friends. You have also relied on your professors, instructors and advisors who cared about your success and wellbeing. It is exactly the same for your university. UBC in the Okanagan could not have grown, could not have met breathtakingly ambitious enrollment targets, could not have established an impressive research profile, without 3  wonderful support from our community here in the Okanagan. I want to thank the Okanagan Nation Alliance for welcoming us, the city of Kelowna and cities up and down the valley for providing concrete support in a myriad of ways, and community organizations and businesses for partnering with us. Finally, I want to thank you graduates for choosing UBC and your families for entrusting you to us. So as you cross the stage today, I hope that you will remember and continue to fulfill the ambition that helped to create your success, remember the balancing that allowed you to experience the full riches of your student life, and remember the community of support that helped you to reach this happy day. In return, I promise that your university will continue to realize its great ambitions to provide an outstanding experience for new generations of students, it will continue to balance its commitments to the Okanagan and to the wider world, and it will continue to recognize with gratitude the incredible support that we receive from throughout the valley. Good luck, and thank you.  4

1.0102611~Dialogue on the history of Indian residential schools in Canada~Toope, Stephen J.~Dialogue on the History of Indian Residential Schools in Canada Tuesday, November 1, 2011 – UBC First Nations House of Learning Professor Stephen J. Toope, President and Vice-Chancellor Ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests:  There is a day coming, just a few days from today, a day that a majority of Canadians set apart from the rest, once every year, to remember and to grieve. We will mark this day with the words, “Lest we forget,” and with silence. We will wear red poppies on our lapels as symbols of our remembrance, and of the sacrifices made. We will tell the stories of those sacrifices in our schools, and in our homes—grandparent to grandchild, generation to generation—lest we forget.  And yet: There is not a single generation of people in this country, elders, adults, or children, all of whom know the truth about the residential schools and the treatment of Canada’s Aboriginal people there; no generation who knows these truths about our home-land the way we know the truth of these wars fought on foreign soil.  Residential School Dialogue Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 5  Forcible removal of children from their families and communities; repression and destruction of culture and identity; loss of language, of connection, and in so many cases of life; routine abuse – the effects of all of this on individuals, their families, and their communities are intergenerational, and continue to this day. As it is in war, what they have lost, and what all of us have lost as a society, is incalculable. A part of what we are here to do today is to bear witness to the truth of this, and I commend your courage and your commitment to doing so.  Another part of what we are here to do today is to address the university’s role in preserving, interpreting, and instructing about this aspect of our shared history, and to ask ourselves whether there is a place for us in helping to bring about reconciliation between Canadian society and its institutions, and Aboriginal communities.  Two years ago, The University of British Columbia set forth a new strategic plan. We called it Place and Promise, and we used the word ‘promise’ in its name because we had decided at every level of administration and  Residential School Dialogue Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 5  operation that we did not want to set goals we would strive for; we wanted to make commitments we would keep. One of the primary commitments of the plan says this: …. In respect of the Musqueam and Okanagan lands on which the University sits, and with all voices raised to tell a new story, UBC advances educational opportunities with and for Aboriginal people on its campuses and in the wider community. In response to the expressed needs and aspirations of Aboriginal peoples, UBC engages in research and generates curricula across the University that respect, reflect, and include Aboriginal cultures, histories, and systems of knowledge. In both academics and operations, the University addresses issues of ignorance and misunderstanding resulting from the educational failures of the past. UBC is now academic home to over 50,000 students, a thousand of whom are Aboriginal. While it is a cliché to say that no two students are the same, it is imperative that we understand and account for the fact that no two come from the same social, cultural, or family history. Whereas “school” may mean the promise of a better future to some, it may mean something else entirely to others. Sometimes, a desk is not just a desk. In all that we do, we must remember this so that we do not create echoes of the past in this time and place.  Residential School Dialogue Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 5  Before I close, I want to take a risk and bring up UBC’s motto. The motto, in Latin, is “tu um est,” which may be translated as, “It’s up to you.” I’m taking a risk, though, because it may also be translated as, “It’s yours,” which, depending on who you’re talking to, is a controversial thing to say about a university when that university sits on traditional Aboriginal lands.  Just for today, I would like to re-imagine the UBC motto to mean the following: o When we say, “It’s yours,” let us mean: What happened in the residential schools is part of our shared history as UBC students, staffs or faculty members, or alumni, and as Canadians. o When we say, “It’s up to you,” let us mean: It’s our responsibility now to know the truth, to remember it always, and to pass it on to our children and our children’s children … lest we forget.  Residential School Dialogue Professor Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 5  There is a day coming, not so very long from now, when we in Canada will all know the truth. When we will be able to look with genuine understanding to the people among us who suffered and say together, Never again. We know. We will remember. On behalf of The University of British Columbia, and in collaboration with all of you, we commit to bringing about that day.  -30-  
1.0102606~Stephen Toope : federal budget signals a commitment to innovation~Toope, Stephen J.~*Originally appeared in the National Post, 30 March 2012 – 9:52 AM ET Stephen Toope: Federal budget signals a commitment to innovation By Stephen Toope In the global knowledge economy, a country’s greatest strategic advantage is its capacity to discover and innovate. The federal government acknowledged this clearly in Thursday’s budget, with its commitment to make smart investments in research and innovation. Maintaining such priorities at a time of difficult fiscal decisions affirms Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s declared ambition to position Canada as a centre of excellence in research, innovation and higher education. That last component — higher education — is critical to the mix. Education is our best tool for cultivating creativity and equipping citizens to engage globally. When it comes to developing our human potential, Canada’s universities deliver the greatest possible return on investment. They prepare today’s students for tomorrow’s challenges. They strengthen our communities and drive discovery through dynamic research. They are where critical questions are asked — curious, provocative questions — yielding insights that reframe challenges and expose new possibilities. Universities play a vital role not only in generating specific innovations, but in building an overall culture of innovation, embedding it in the character of our country. To make the most of our investments in higher education, we have to create conditions within our universities that will attract highly qualified international students and professors — and entice talented Canadians from all walks of life to stay and do their best work here at home. The benefits associated with investing in higher education, research and innovation are profound: A strong economy, unlocking human potential, enhancing our quality of life. Fortunately, public investments in Canadian research and innovation have increased nearly fourfold since 1995 — and continue to rise even during the economic downturn. Around the world, countries are moving quickly to advance their discovery and innovation agendas. This is especially true among emerging economies, which are transforming themselves through dramatic investments in higher education and research. The number of people graduating from China’s universities and specialized colleges has nearly quadrupled since 2000, and the so-called BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — tripled their output of scientific articles between 1996 and 2007, a measure of their drive to innovate. Canada cannot afford to rest on its laurels, and our government understands that reality. In presenting a strategic, multi-year agenda for discovery and innovation — including stable funding for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and new investment in the Canada Foundation for Innovation — the federal budget signals a commitment to ensuring that Canada is a leader in innovation.  Our future economic strength and social cohesion will depend less on what we now know, and more on what we are capable of learning. We must enhance our capacity to acquire, discover and utilize knowledge. This is — and has always been — the role of universities. With sustained support, Canadian universities will continue to be laboratories of change and incubators of resilience-producing global citizens who are ready to thrive in a world where nothing stands still and the future belongs to those who imagine it, and build it, first. Stephen Toope is the president and vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia. He is also chair of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC).  
1.0102620~UBC Alma Mater Society All Presidents’ Dinner~Toope, Stephen J.~Page 1 of 6  UBC Alma Mater Society All Presidents? Dinner  January 31, 2013 Professor Stephen J. Toope Good evening. I am delighted and honoured be here tonight. It is always an energizing experience to be among UBC?s student leaders. In anticipation of this year?s All Presidents? Dinner, I gave some thought to what exactly it is that motivates certain students to take on the added ? and often onerous - responsibilities of leading a campus organization. No doubt the reasons are varied. I suspect that some of you have clear aspirations to serve as leaders in business or public service or in professional life. Others may have specific objectives in mind, perhaps to affect change in an area of keen interest. Still others might simply believe that extracurricular activity of this nature will eventually pay off in some yet-to-be-determined way. In any case, Bravo. For others, there is perhaps no direct link between your leadership activities today and your future plans, or at least not one that you have presently identified. But in the meantime you enjoy the intellectual challenge and the interactivity with other students. Or maybe you?ve simply discovered that you have inherent leadership capabilities. Or maybe an opportunity arose that happened to provide some perks ? perhaps an office here in the SUB for you to use as a base of operations to be envied by your friends. All Presidents Dinner    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 2 of 6  Page 2 of 6  If you fall into one of these camps, I still say, Bravo. Your leadership burden is no less noble, for you are bound to learn a great deal and you can still provide a valuable service to fellow students. But I?ll come back to this group in a moment. Irrespective of the reason you have chosen to lead, your timing is impeccable. We are entering an era in which leadership opportunities will abound for your generation. You?ve all seen the headlines about the predicted arrival of an acute skilled-labour shortage as the baby boomers retire. I?m a late baby boomer, so I have a way to go yet! Not surprisingly, the same demographic shift will result in the imminent retirement of a great number of senior leaders in both public and private sectors. Indeed, leadership succession has been a hot topic for some time now in many parts of the world, Japan, Europe and North America in particular. But developing the right leadership skills for the 21st century won?t be as easy as attending a trade school. Let?s face it. Leading people has never been easy and it?s getting more difficult all the time as organizations grow larger, more complex, and potentially more disconnected than ever before. Perhaps you?ve heard the story of a man flying in a hot air balloon who realizes he is lost. He reduces altitude and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon a little further and shouts, ?Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?? All Presidents Dinner    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 3 of 6  Page 3 of 6  The man below says, ?Yes, you are in a hot air balloon hovering about 10 metres above this field.? ?You must work in information technology,? says the balloonist. ?I do,? replies the man, ?How did you know?? ?Well,? says the balloonist, ?everything you have told me is technically correct, but it is of no use to me.? The man below says, ?You must work in management.? ?I do,? replies the balloonist, ?but how did you know?? ?Well, says the man, ?you don?t know where you are or where you are going, but you expect me to be able to help you. You are in the same position you were before we met, but now it?s my fault.? Among other things, this anecdote lampoons the kind of dis-connect that can occur within large organizations. But it also underscores the importance for leaders to have a strategic destination clearly in mind, and a means of sharing that destination with all members of the group he or she is leading. Conventional wisdom tells us that people who understand an organization?s strategy can more readily identify how they can contribute, particularly if they also have a means of monitoring progress and challenges on the specific objectives they are pursuing. But as important as these leadership principles are, effective modern leaders need to bring additional capabilities to bear. Business school professors all seem to agree that leadership is now about much more than sharing objectives and motivating others; it?s also All Presidents Dinner    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 4 of 6  Page 4 of 6  about working across cultural boundaries and facilitating change. Simply stated, it?s about adaptability to new and changing circumstances. Perhaps you have heard the term, ?learning agility.? I?m not certain who coined the term, but it simply means the ability to adapt to shifting demands, or to take lessons from the past and fit them into new and different situations. Learning agility, as an imperative for modern leadership, cannot be understated. Security, stability and predictability are no longer the norm. Today, it is far more common for organizations - public, professional and private ? to have culturally diverse employee populations and clients, and to operate in a constant state of change. New demands, new products, new services, new communication tools, mergers, acquisitions, downsizing, upsizing, shifting technologies ? the causes are endless. One naturally concludes that a certain amount of learning agility is essential for all of us, but at no time before has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances been more essential for leaders than it is today. With that in mind, it strikes me that the activities you have undertaken as leaders of UBC student organizations are of added significance, particularly for those of you with long-term leadership aspirations. Simply put, you need to learn all that you can, as soon as you can. Above all, it is essential that you strive to be agile learners so that you can meet the All Presidents Dinner    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 5 of 6  Page 5 of 6  adaptability imperatives of leadership in the 21st century, and thereby prepare yourselves for the many opportunities that lay ahead. But it isn?t just opportunities that abound within the leadership communities of the future. There is also need, specifically - human need. In many parts of the world, we see what many regard as leadership crises, from European central bankers, to a deadlocked US Government, to some of our provincial and federal political parties ? all centred around good and well intentioned people who don?t always agree on major issues. As a safeguard to human interests, it is only prudent for us to assume that the need for learning-agile leaders ? highly adaptive free thinkers who can see new solutions to complex problems ? grows more acute within the public arena. And what may be compounding the challenges in the public arena is reluctance on the part of too many of the most capable learning-agile leaders to enter. One underlying cause that has been suggested is that the proliferation of social media has led to public leaders being exposed to more scrutiny and criticism than ever before, and with a much lighter burden of proof than that demanded of conventional journalism. Indeed, haven?t we all asked ourselves the question: ?What capable person would want to suffer the slings and arrows of public leadership?? The answer is?somebody. If healthy civil societies are to be protected in the regions where they exist, and advanced in regions where do not, somebody has to step All Presidents Dinner    Prof. Stephen J. Toope                                                                                                                        Page 6 of 6  Page 6 of 6  forward. Somebody has to step forward in every jurisdiction, every sector, and for every just cause - for the very simple reason that every part of the world needs every good and ethical leader it can get. And so getting back to those of you who don?t see an immediate connection between what you are doing today and what you hope to be doing tomorrow, I respectfully urge you to think again. Think about both the abundant opportunities and the critical needs within modern societies.  And while you?re at it, think about who, what and where you are today ? bright, engaged and committed students at one of the world?s top  universities; agile learners who have been willingly drawn into the service of others, and who are already making great contributions to your university and to fellow students.  And so the question I hope you?ll all consider is this: Who among your generation is best suited to respond to the opportunities and needs within your future leadership communities?  As I see it, the answer takes the form of another question. Who better than you?  Good luck, and thank you. 
1.0102594~2012 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~1             2012 Fall Congregation     Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia           21-23 November 2012       2  Madam Chancellor, Distinguished colleagues; honoured guests; members of the UBC graduating class of 2012.  What a great day for you graduates.  You?ve worked hard and you?ve made it.  Congratulations! But I am afraid that there is one final test before you graduate: how many of you know who ?Joseph Anton? is?  [Look to professors on platform as well]?  Not good enough ? I may just have to call this off! Alright, I admit that my question is a trick, the sort of question one should never see on a real exam.  ?Joseph Anton? was the name the brilliant novelist Salman Rushdie used for eleven years as he hid from the unconscionable death decree imposed upon him arbitrarily by the then-supreme ruler of Iran, the Ayatollah Khomeini.  Rushdie made up the name at the request of the British security services protecting him.  He simply combined the first names of two of his favourite writers, Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. ?Salman Rushdie? and ?Joseph Anton:? Are they the same person?  Not quite, for the fake name was chosen in part to disguise Rushdie?s identity as an Anglo-Indian of Muslim heritage.  And consider the ?godfathers,? as Rushdie calls them, whose names he chose.  Conrad, a Pole who wrote in English of voyages into the heart of darkness, of wanderers hiding their identities.  Chekhov, a nostalgic Russian depicting the very moment of change from a static but reassuring old world to a new one full of doubt.  Although forced upon him in a cruel and unjust way, the choice that Rushdie made to call himself ?Joseph Anton? seems to me a perfect metaphor for the complexity that we all face in a world where old certainties 3  are constantly challenged, where even who we are cannot be answered simply or singularly. Rushdie himself describes his life?s work as an attempt to address ?the great question of how the world joins up ? not only how the East flows into the West and the West into the East but how the past shapes the present even as the present changes our understanding of the past. ??i  That?s a tall order, but I suspect that in our own small ways, we are all struggling with the same question.   I couldn?t think of a better question for you to ask yourselves on this day of graduation:  How does the world ?join up??  To try to answer it, you will have to draw on what you learned in your families and with friends, on what you learned from teachers and professors, on what you learned through your independent academic work, on what you learned from your ethical and faith explorations, on what you learned from your community volunteering, on what you learned on the sports field or in choir, or in going global.  In short, to even begin to answer how the world joins up, you will have to begin to integrate everything you know into who you are. But ? and here is the irony ? the integration of all those ways of knowing probably won?t make you a unitary you.  Bringing all that you have learned together will most likely reinforce a sense that your own identity is multiple: son or daughter; sister or brother; Canadian, Iranian, Chinese; scientist; philosopher; Afro-Canadian or Inuit; gay, straight or bi; a deeply frustrated member of the hockey nation. I hope that your university education has helped you to work that all through, not to find singularity, but to embrace complexity even within 4  yourself.  I hope that you have learned that the best answer is a better question; that you are most able to know when most open to doubt. Consider the admonition of Amit Majmudar, a young American novelist, poet and diagnostic nuclear radiologist.  This poem is called: To The Hyphenated Poets Richer than mother?s milk is half-and-half.  Friends of two minds, redouble your craft. ?  Oneness? Pure chimera. Splendor is spliced. Make your halves into something twice your size,  your tongue a hyphen joining nation to nation. Recombine, become a thing of your own creation,  a many-minded mongrel, the line?s renewal, self-made and twofold, soul and dual.ii  I trust that none of you will ever have to live a life like Joseph Anton?s.  But I hope that all of you will take up the challenge to figure out just how the world joins up.  You can be ?a many-minded mongrel.?  Your tongue can be ?a hyphen joining nation to nation.?  Delight in your own complexity, and that of our world, because ?splendor is spliced.?  Good luck. 5                                                   i Salman Rushdie, Joseph Anton: A Memoir (New York: Random House, 2012). ii Amit Majumdar, ?To The Hyphenated Poets? in The New Yorker, 17 September 2012, at 86. 
1.0102608~2013 Spring Congregation and Convocation~Toope, Stephen J.~        2013 Spring Congregation and Convocation     Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia    22 May ? 7 June 2013   Page 2 of 6  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2013.  You are graduating into a complicated and perplexing world.  Of course, most generations think that their time is particularly tough.  So let?s all get a grip.  You could be completing your studies at Cambridge in 1348 facing the black death; graduating in the 15th century in Salamanca, subjected to the Spanish Inquisition; in 1835 from Trinity College Dublin with the prospect of starvation from the potato famine all around you; or in 1943 most anywhere in the world, surrounded by war and fear.  Our troubles and worries are much less daunting.  Yet it is true that our world is complicated and perplexing.  But have courage: few people on earth are better prepared to take the world on, confusing as it is, than you.  That?s because you have the gift of a university education ? not free, but a gift nonetheless ? a gift still denied to the vast majority of young people on our globe.  Page 3 of 6  Here is what Albert Einstein had to say about studying: Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as hard duty. Never regard study as duty but as the enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later work belongs.  In this brief quote, Einstein ties together four important ideas.  First, that teaching and learning are gifts to the individual student.  Second, that they are ?enviable opportunities,  enviable because they are not afforded to everyone.  Third, teaching and learning are liberating because they are beautiful in and of themselves, and fourth, they also help the wider community because of what the student has to offer as a result of his or her study.  I want to focus briefly on that fourth point, that an education is a gift not only to the student, but to the entire community.  In the most obvious sense, that gift is an offering of what we typically call ?skills.?  An educated person ? whether a journalist, a doctor, a plumber, a chemist, a hairdresser, or an engineer ? has a set of skills that can be deployed to create economic value.  Governments all around the world are fixated on Page 4 of 6  this limited notion of education, as a means to generate the skills required to fuel the economy.  In times of profound economic change, like now, governments are also rightly concerned to ensure that the skills people are learning match the jobs that will be available.  The risk for governments is that they will keep their sights too low, looking at what is immediately in front of them in a four-year election cycle, failing to see the even greater economic and social changes just over the horizon.  If we raise our eyes only a little, we see that ?skills? are more than simply content knowledge, more than the technical ability to perform a given function, like removing an appendix, adding up a column of numbers or fitting a pipe.  The skills that we need in our fast-changing society include the ability to work effectively in teams; to sift, analyze and evaluate the plethora of information that comes at us minute by minute; to draw creative connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.  I could go on.   The gift of education to our community, in Einstein?s terms, is not merely technical knowledge; it is critical capacity, creativity and empathetic judgment ? the bread and butter of a university education. Page 5 of 6   Let me conclude by pursuing the argument one step further.  I fear that one of the main reasons that so many governments today shortsightedly conflate education and the acquisition of technical skills is that they have lost sight of who we, the people, are.  I don?t know whether or not you have noticed, but more and more often, governments around the world describe the people they supposedly serve as ?taxpayers.?  All well and good.  But we are much more than that.  We are citizens.  The great judge, Louis Brandeis of the US Supreme Court, once described citizenship as ?the most important office.?  He was right.  Without engaged, active citizens, no form of governance can be healthy.  And engaged, active citizenship is promoted by a good education.  I am not saying that you can?t be a good citizen without an education; there are millions of examples to the contrary.  But the first aim of education is, I believe, to help people become better citizens, not just of countries but of the world.  That is why we so often talk of leadership amongst our students, why education is so much more than learning a set of technical skills. Page 6 of 6   Taxpayers are passive, doing their legal duty by completing their forms and writing cheques.  Citizens voice opinions and organize their societies; they take action in the face of injustice and inequality.  Educated citizens deploy their critical capacity, creativity and empathetic judgment to become the leaders of citizens.  That is your potential, and one that I wish our governments would embrace more fully.  Consider this encouraging idea from the cultural anthropologist, Margaret Mead:  "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."  If you think that there are things in the world that need changing, go out and try to make it happen.  Be active citizens. That?s what your education is for. Congratulations to each and every one of you, and good luck. 
1.0107469~International Education for Peace Conference~Toope, Stephen J.~International Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007, 9:00 to 10:30 a.m. Century Plaza Hotel  Prof. Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 1  Thank you, and good morning.  It is customary in moments like this for a keynote speaker to begin by thanking organizers for the invitation to speak. But I would like to go one step further this morning and to thank Dr. Danesh and the International Education for Peace Institute for organizing this entire conference.  I find among my own friends and colleagues a split sense of the world just now. On one hand, I see a ready sense of fear. Globally, we have lost the post-Cold War optimism that prevailed during the early 1990s. In Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Darfur – in Myanmar and now in Pakistan – we have clues to how quickly the world can descend into chaos. The so-called “war on terror” is built on fear; justifying dangerous adventures and repressive policies that attack civil liberties.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 2  The collapse of the ocean’s bounty and the global environmental threat of climate change also suggest that we face risks of chaotic migrations and resource wars in the coming century. It is an unnerving time.  On the other hand, I also sense a degree of hope that the world is coming to its senses. I see hints of promising policy shifts among some of the world’s great governments and inspiring personal changes in the habits of the people around me. Certainly, students at universities around the globe are working hard to address issues such as climate change. At the University of British Columbia, thousands of students have now signed a sustainability pledge, committing themselves to make personal choices that reduce their ecological footprint. The University itself has made institutional choices that have resulted in our reaching and surpassing our Kyoto targets years ahead of schedule.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 3  At such a time, the world needs both inspiration and leadership – leadership that is sometimes in short supply.  The great Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson offered this comment when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1956. Pearson said: “The grim fact is that we prepare for war like precocious giants and for peace like retarded pygmies.”  Pearson can be criticized now for his political incorrectness, but the underlying point is germane. There are many colleges of war, but too few institutes for peace. Our “departments of defense” seem increasingly to be on the offensive while our aid agencies are forced into tax-cutting retrenchment.  The EFP example is, indeed, inspiring. It is exactly the kind of leadership we need. So thank you to Dr. Ganesh and the EFP  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 4  and thank you to all of you for coming and making this conference a success. You give me hope.  I have promised today to talk about the role of universities in educating for peace – a role that I think of as highly integrated, highly interdisciplinary and thoroughly interactive with surrounding communities and institutions.  But I’d like to begin by telling two stories – stories that I think give the topic a certain degree of context.  The first involves the children of a colleague, three young boys born in quick succession.  The eldest of these three is a gentle soul who was born into a gentle household. In his first year, the boy was coddled and comfortable, and when the next brother came along, that level of  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 5  physical tenderness continued to prevail. Neither boy had any experience of violence or even much of discomfort.  Boys being boys, the experience of the third child was a little more rigorous. As an infant, this youngest child learned to expect that a well-intentioned hug might sometimes feel more like a rugby tackle. He learned very quickly to put up with a certain amount of bumping about – and he didn’t take it personally.  But sometime before his second birthday, this youngest child learned something else. He learned that his elder brothers couldn’t take a punch.  This knowledge came in the way that most knowledge comes to toddlers – through experimentation. In an early effort at what we might call “dispute resolution,” the youngest brother had lashed out – and to very good effect. Rather than punching him back, the  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 6  eldest brother had collapsed in a puddle of shattered dignity and tears.  A tyrant was born. In the weeks that followed, the youngest brother reset the power relationships in the entire household. He demanded what he wanted and he extracted a quick and violent price if he didn’t get his way. In fact, it got to the point that this toddling terror would bash a brother for pure entertainment. In a way that was horrifying to his parents, he was clearly enjoying his new position of dominance.  These were challenging days for the parents. Like any overstretched police force, they couldn’t stand guard every moment. And for obvious reasons they were hesitant to coach the eldest brother to defend himself. They were hesitant to say: “Hit him back.”  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 7  But the father was delighted to be on the scene the day that finally happened. Driven to a breaking point, the eldest brother finally retaliated – and with sufficient fury to make his little brother reconsider the intelligence of starting a cycle of violence.  The result was a rather larger puddle of shattered dignity and tears – as well as a very “teachable moment.” Scolding both children with relatively equal vigor, the father proposed a set of more sensible dispute-resolution techniques –and the reign of terror passed. The boys, now teenagers, are still brothers. They still “fight” in the sense of disagreeing vehemently. But none of them has thrown a punch in more than a decade.  I tell this story not to suggest that violence is inherent in the human heart. Children who hit one another in frustration or anger are not evil.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 8  But we are a curious and innovative race. We experiment. Long before we have the capacity to understand what is “right” and what is “wrong,” we try things out. And if a certain strategy works in a certain situation, we put it in the tool kit and we try to apply it again as other opportunities arise.  And, as the cliché goes, when your only tool is a hammer, all of your problems start to look like nails.  The second story I want to tell is darker and deeply personal. And it also involves three boys.  I have only a younger sister, so there were no ebullient brothers in my own so-gentle upbringing. I was in my thirties before anyone laid a punch on me that really hurt. Then my life was rocked in a way that I still find unimaginable.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 9  I was, at the time, the Dean of Law at McGill University in Montreal. I had a wonderful wife, a lovely daughter, and a son who had just arrived. I had every reason to believe my parents’ teaching – that we were living in a beneficent universe.  Then one day, during a meeting, I was given an urgent phone message. I learned later that night that my parents had been brutally murdered in their quiet suburban home.  Within a couple of days the perpetrators had been caught; three teen-aged boys, who had no real motive, who had killed for fun.  I suggested only moments ago that I saw no evil intent inherent in the human heart, but that incident – the murder of my parents – was an act of pure evil. I can’t think of it in any other way.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 10  And I can’t imagine the circumstances that created three nihilist teenagers out of three, once-innocent boys. I can’t begin to accept the number of times that the teachable moment must have been lost in those ruined lives.  That, for me, is the context of our challenge.  That is why I will argue today that the university’s role in education for peace is not theoretical. Because, for me – as for many of you – the absence of peace is not a theoretical concept.  That is not to say, however, that we cannot benefit by thinking about peace education in theoretical terms. I was helped, for example, by the work of University of Wisconsin Professor Ian Harris, with which some of you may be familiar.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 11  Harris sets out five postulates for peace education and five different kinds of peace education. The postulates – five principles that speak to the challenges of teaching about peace – are these:  1. Peace education explains the roots of violence.  Painful as it is to look deeper into violence, it has been demonstrated through processes like the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission that violence must be understood to be overcome.  2. Peace education teaches alternatives to violence.  If we arm our citizens with an inadequate tool kit – if they believe that violence is their only available strategy – violence will be the inevitable result.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 12  3. Peace education adjusts to cover different forms of violence.  There is no single lesson that is applicable in all instances, and no single dispute resolution institution or delivery mechanism that is universally appropriate.  4. Peace itself is a process that varies according to context. As educators – and as citizens – we must be constantly alert to cultural, social and economic contexts.  5. Conflict is omnipresent.  I said earlier that violence is not inherent in the human condition, but I think we must accept that it is inevitable. It is a strategy that some people will stumble upon and experiment with.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 13  We must recognize that despair, and we must redouble our efforts to design and promulgate alternative paths.  Harris’s categorization of five different kinds of peace education is also helpful and begins to speak more directly to how I see the university role.  The first of the five categories Harris describes as “International Education” – the pursuit of which is very much what brought me to UBC.  The UBC Vision Statement – in place before I arrived– is this: “The University of British Columbia, aspiring to be one of the world’s best universities, will prepare students to become exceptional global citizens, promote the values of a civil and sustainable society, and conduct outstanding research to serve the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world.”  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 14  The active part of that vision, for the purposes of this conversation, is the creation of “exceptional global citizens (who) promote the values of a civil and sustainable society.”  Engendering this level of citizenship is not the work of a single department at UBC. There is no mandatory civics course that we force students to take so they can be suddenly anointed as global citizens. Rather, it is a call to action in every part of the university. It is the job of every faculty and staff member at UBC to try to help our students understand their responsibilities in a global context.  For some students, that involves something obvious like participating in one of UBC’s many international co-op or community-service learning opportunities, or living in one of our four international residences, where Canadian students work, study  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 15  and play in the company of international students from Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, from the University of Seoul in Korea, from Mexico’s Tec de Monterrey and from Hong Kong University.  But learning about citizenship and sustainability can also occur when students ride the bus rather than bringing a car, when they use their math skills to help aboriginal high school students to reach higher – lessons can be drawn from how every individual lives and works at any of our UBC campuses.  Harris defines his second category of education for peace as “Human Rights Education.” This speaks to an area of personal interest. My own academic specialty is International Law, International Human Rights, and Legal Reform. I was, for example, Chair of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and I served as Fact Finder for the  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 16  Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Government Officials in relation to Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was rendered from the United States to Syria, where he was imprisoned and tortured.  It is essential that all of us – in all countries and in all walks of life – understand the inviolability of human rights. It is essential that we understand that you cannot abrogate the human rights of a single community, or of a single individual, without ultimately compromising or devaluing the sense of peace and security of every individual.  Harris next identifies “Development Education,” and I am inclined to return here to the lessons of citizenship. We tend to think of development, automatically, as something that occurs in “developing” countries – something that under current budgets is not occurring nearly often enough, especially in Africa which is  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 17  once again being ignored after a brief flurry of interest on the part of OECD governments.  But there is a more immediate example of development that is much closer to home. UBC has a community service learning project called the Learning Exchange, in which volunteers from UBC– students, staff, faculty, and alumni – go into inner city schools and non-profit organizations. They contribute to community programs while learning about inner city issues and working in solidarity with community and educational leaders . And as much as possible, the volunteer work of students is integrated into academic course work, creating truly mutual benefit: the community benefits and the student volunteers take away invaluable lessons in citizenship – in human development issues occurring in their own backyard.  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 18  I am proud to say that we are currently a national leader in developing and implementing the community service learning approach.  The fourth area of education for peace Harris identifies is “Environmental Education,” and I have referred to this already. It will be difficult to maintain peace among the human populations on earth if we don’t first make peace with the planet. We are consuming its resources at a rate that is unsustainable. Many of the wars that are currently underway have direct links to those resources, whether it is oil in Iraq or water in Darfur. Even the longstanding disputes in the Middle East arise in no small part from environmental issues, from the battle over the resources of land and water.  At the university level, these are issues that are addressed across nearly all faculties, whether we are looking directly at the  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 19  environment in the sciences, creating alternative energy options in engineering, looking for more sustainable economic mechanisms in our business school, or making progress in environmental law.  UBC is also a world leader in environmental action-research through the work of people like John Robinson of the Sustainable Development Research Institute and Bill Rees, who developed the concept of the ecological footprint.  Harris’s last category in peace education is one of the most obvious: “Conflict Resolution.” Here again, the potential for university input is huge.  This may seem like a theoretical area, but conflict resolution is all about tactics and strategies. It’s all about figuring out better ways of addressing disputes and seeking peaceful outcomes. We do it at the theoretical level – but we also do it at the practical level  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 20  through agencies such as the Liu Centre for the Study of Global Issues, our School of Social Work, or the UBC Centre for Asian Legal Studies, from which our faculty are often called to work on pressing, current local and international issues.  I said at the outset that I thought the university role should be integrated, interactive and interdisciplinary, and I would like to come back to that. Just as we have chosen not to departmentalize internationalism, I think it would be a mistake for a university like ours to try to trap peace education in a particular faculty or department.  First, the history of such efforts suggests that they are ultimately limiting. For example, if you lodge an education for peace program in a psychology department, it is almost inevitable that the other members of the department will discourage work that may be relevant to peace, but is not directly related to the  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 21  advancement of psychology. Similarly, an education faculty might fight for the development of pedagogy but shun complex discussions of human rights or the environment as work more appropriately pursued by other departments.  Education for peace should be understood and included as part of education for citizenship. It should be all-encompassing, as it is necessarily interdisciplinary. Clearly, we cannot absolve early childhood learning specialists any more than we would dismiss international legal scholars. Education for peace, like the goal of seeking a more sustainable world, must be the task of a diverse cross section of faculty members, staff members –students and graduates of UBC.  In terms of the interactive aspect, the University must recognize, in everything that we do, the value of doing it in partnership. There is no magic ivory surrounding the towers at  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 22  UBC’s Point Grey campus. There is no cloister in Kelowna at UBC Okanagan and there are no walls around our downtown location at UBC Robson Square or at the Great Northern Way campus, where we work in cooperation with Simon Fraser University, the Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design and the B.C. Institute of Technology to reach across traditional barriers.  We do our best work when we do it in concert with the community. Our students tell us that they learn the liveliest and most lasting lessons when they connect their classroom work to problems in the wider world, whether they are working in co-op positions in Canada or around the globe, or volunteering in a dentistry clinic in the Downtown Eastside.  The Dalai Lama, who has connected strongly to our community right here in Vancouver, has compellingly championed the goal of “educating the heart.” Only through self-reflection –  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 23  through contemplation – can we nurture the qualities of peace, empathy and compassion in our own hearts, qualities that can inform and transform the education of the head.  I believe that we are, once again, at a critical time in the history of humanity. Through our innovation and experimentation, we have achieved a seeming mastery over our environment. We now work with various technologies that have the capacity to destroy our own world – and it appears that we are doing so by inadvertence if not by intent.  The question we now must answer is whether humankind has the capacity to live in peace – with one another and with all the other living things that comprise a sustainable globe. As we seek to answer that question, we are privileged to greet each new child as an open book, each new day as an unrealized opportunity. Everywhere we look, there are teachable moments. We cannot let  Education for Peace Conference November 16, 2007; Page 24  them pass. At our universities, the opportunities to help our community to reflect on the values, possibilities and processes of peace are myriad. We must take them up.  I want to thank you all again for your attention this morning and for your commitment to this important issue. I wish you the best, for the remainder of the conference, and in all that you do.  
1.0107481~Speaking notes : create UBC [Okanagan], September 8, 2009~Toope, Stephen J.~Speaking notes Create UBC September 8, 2009  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Thank you Chelsea (Butchart).  Good morning! Congratulations! You’ve arrived!  I am so pleased to be here to once again welcome so many of the best and brightest high-school graduates and transfer students from around British Columbia, across Canada, and from so many countries throughout the world. It gives us great pride to know that you have chosen UBC over so many other institutions that were similarly eager to have you as students.  Welcome to Canada, welcome to Kelowna, and welcome to the University of British Columbia.  Today, I want to briefly discuss four different topics: plans… expectations…hopes…and fears.  2  First, plans. It occurs to me that some of you have come here with well-charted plans in mind for your education, and perhaps also some clear aspirations for your subsequent career. If that is the case, excellent – well done.  Some of you, on the other hand, may not have charted a course as clearly defined as that, but you certainly have expectations about what you want to learn, experience and achieve during your time here. You too are to be commended, for your foresight, and for taking ownership of your learning experience.  And no doubt there are some of you who are not yet clear on what to expect for your university education, let alone have a plan for how it will unfold and where it will lead you. But at the very least, you have hopes – hopes that it will be a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience that will help you to identify the next steps you will take in your journey.  3  If you are in this category, congratulations! In many ways you stand to have a particularly enriching experience, because you are naturally open and receptive to the vast spectrum of intellectual wealth and stimuli you will encounter here.  And finally, some of you have arrived here gripped with fears – maybe even outright terror!  If you fall into this category, rest assured you’re not alone. In fact, I can assure you that every one of the people with plans, expectations and hopes are also struck with at least some measure of fear. My advice to you is to take a moment to remind yourself of your outstanding success to date, and how your talent and efforts have qualified you for admission into a university that ranks solidly among the top 35 in the world.  4  At the same time though, it might be a good idea to make as many friends as possible with people in the “hopes” category. You might be surprised at how quickly the fear gives way!  But irrespective of which category – or combination thereof – that you fall into, you are all to be congratulated for what you have achieved in the course of your formal education. Your challenge now is to ensure you make the most of this rare and precious opportunity. To that end, I want to make the following recommendations.  First, strive to link your experiences in the classroom, library or lab to the wider world. During orientation, you will hear about the many opportunities that UBC offers to enrich your learning experience through programs such as Co-op, Work Learn, and Service Learning.  5  Take the time to consider carefully which of these experiential learning opportunities will further enhance your academic experience, and provide you with that additional “margin of excellence” in the years ahead.  The second recommendation is to make meaningful connections with as many of your fellow students as possible during your time here. In particular, I urge you to resist the temptation to seek the comfort of associating primarily with students from your own country, or home town, or your own academic program, or housing unit. The connections you establish with a wider range of students will not only contribute to a greater sense of community on campus, they will also serve you well in the years to follow – even a lifetime.  The third recommendation is to participate in a wide range of activities, and to generously share with your fellow students the  6  precious gifts that each of you bring – and that is your ideas and your unique understanding.  There can be no doubt that the addition of some two thousand new students, reflecting the thoughts and experiences of so many of Canada’s best and brightest – not to mention those of countless cultures from throughout the world – will infinitely enrich the caliber of dialogue that will take place here, and which are among the most essential elements of an education that is truly global in nature.  So having talked about plans, expectations, hopes and fears, I want to introduce a fifth topic, and that is change.  The Irish poet and playwright, William Butler Yeats, once wrote: “education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”  7  What Yeats probably intended to symbolize with the phrase “the lighting of a fire” is the discovery of a passion, or in other words, the process of finding out exactly what it is that truly excites and energizes you.  It also occurs to me that “the lighting a fire” is most likely to occur when we encounter – and when we are open and receptive to – new and compelling ideas, new and profound experiences, and new and intriguing people. In doing so, we open our minds to new curiosity, new interests…and yes, new ambitions.  Even those of you who have well defined plans or clear expectations for your education may be surprised by how those plans and expectations can be affected – indeed, how they can be changed – by the new ideas, new experiences and new people that you will encounter here.  8  And so my final recommendation is to not lose sight of your plans, expectations and hopes, but at the same time do not fear change. And above all be open and receptive to the newness that surrounds you here.  Think of this place we call UBC as a place of complete openness – of openness in all of its forms.  A place of physical openness, that lends itself equally to vibrant human interaction, and quiet solitary reflection.  A place of international openness – a hub of global connectivity that emphasizes internationalization in both learning and research.  And most important of all, a place of intellectual openness – one that welcomes and inspires diversity, innovation…and change… and from where great things will continue to emerge to affect local communities, and entire populations throughout the world. 9  Before I conclude, I want to show you more precisely what I mean. You are about to be the first-ever audience to view a short video that we have created – one that is based upon two years of consultation with students, faculty, alumni, and community members.  This video is intended to launch a whole campaign, one that we hope will aid us in telling our UBC story, to explain exactly what it is that has solidified our reputation among the great universities of the world; what it is that empowers us to try anything, to be anything, to carve our own path, and to learn, discover and contribute in our own way.  At the end, I will have a small task for you, so those of you who are carrying cell phones, please have them ready. Lights dim – video rolls Resume text while lights remain dim 10  UBC is a unique place, a Place of Mind. I challenge you to think about what this means to you, and to think about what you can achieve…From Here.  Those of you with cell phones have just been linked to a new community site, powered by you. Please share it widely with fellow students. It’s a place to learn, discover, contribute, comment and get involved.  (pause)  Add your voice. Volunteer. Tackle the big issues. Challenge your peers to do the same.  You have arrived at a place where open thought, open expression, and open minds to new ideas can change the world… and indeed, already have. 11  What will you do here at this Place of Mind?  Where will you go From Here?  (pause)  Have a fabulous week, and good luck to you all!  12  
1.0107465~Campus 2020 : why higher education matters to you~Toope, Stephen J.~CAMPUS 2020: WHY HIGHER EDUCATION MATTERS TO YOU  An address to The Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007, 11:45 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Hotel  Prof. Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 1  Good afternoon. Thank you first of all for the warm welcome.  It is a high priority at UBC – one of the most influential universities in Canada – that we maintain an excellent relationship with this, one of the most influential business organizations; So, merely by inviting me to speak, you have helped me fulfill my first goal in coming here today. The good turnout and the warm welcome are a bonus. Thank you.  I also would like to thank the partners from Fasken Martineau for sponsoring this event. We are greatly indebted for the continuing support that Fasken offers both in keeping up the standard of legal education at UBC and in keeping the UBC Law School and the University as a whole connected with our community. Again, my thanks.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 2  Now, as you will see from the title of my speech, I am here today to talk about Why Higher Education Matters to You, and especially, why it matters in the context of an important new provincial government report called Campus 2020.  But my real goal is to do much more than say something vaguely reassuring about the nature of education in our society. My principal goal is to make university education matter so much that you will actually do something about it.  Today, I hope that you leave feeling energized and, yes, even politicized. I hope that when you have heard what I have to say that you will be eager to support the Campus 2020 recommendations – that you will use your considerable influence on behalf of a more innovative and effective system of higher education in BC.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 3  Higher education needs your support, and so do the people in government who have responsibility to make and implement education policy. Some of that work is quite difficult; there are awkward choices for politicians and bureaucrats alike. They need to know that, if they do the right thing, people will recognize and acknowledge their courage and their wisdom.  So let’s start with the obvious. Why does higher education matter? There are almost too many answers to that question. Each of you probably has a field of interest – a hobby or passing obsession about which you can’t seem to learn enough. The pleasures and rewards of education – of the simple acquisition and sharing of knowledge – are endless.  But for my purposes today, before a predominantly business audience, here’s one simple answer: Education matters because it is the only investment that never reaches a level of diminishing returns. In this world, where you can cut too many trees, make too  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 4  many cars or catch too many fish – where an overabundance of gold or wheat or widgets of any kind acts to depress the market – there is never a point where education begins to lose its value.  Angel Gurría, the Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, addressed this point at a meeting in Paris earlier this month. Gurría presented OECD statistics which show that adding one extra year to the average time of schooling increases GDP per capita by 4 to 6 per cent.  What’s more, he said that increase is compounding and consistent no matter where the extra year is added – no matter the starting point of the economy in question. He said, and I quote: “Even in the countries with the largest growth of university graduates, earnings and employment prospects of graduates keep improving.”  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 5  Imagine any other single economic input that could improve GDP by so much, year after year, with no measurable point of diminishing returns.  The OECD Secretary General offered two explanations for this phenomenon: He said:  “First, education builds human capital and enables workers to be more productive. Second, education increases countries’ capacity to innovate - an indispensable prerequisite for growth and competitiveness in today’s global knowledge economy.”  I believe that Premier Gordon Campbell understood all that when his government set education first among its Five Great Goals for a Golden Decade. Job one on Premier Campbell’s to-do list for his second term in government is this:  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 6  •  “To make B.C. the best educated, most literate jurisdiction on the continent.”  As a step in achieving that goal, Premier Campbell asked former Attorney General Geoff Plant to lead a consultative planning process to help shape the future of post-secondary education in B.C.  The Campus 2020 Report was the result. It is an audacious plan that says government must spend more on tertiary education and must spend it more wisely.  In his report, Plant began by setting out a few fundamentals and a few hard truths. Pointing to the Great Goal, Plant reminded us: “We are not called to mediocrity. We are called to be the best.”  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 7  But, he said, we cannot achieve that goal – we cannot achieve excellence – if we don’t pick our spots, if we don’t marshal our resources carefully and spend them strategically. He said:  “B.C. cannot have a system of higher learning in which all institutions aspire equally to undertake all responsibilities with an equal measure of success. We must be willing to give our diverse institutions distinct responsibilities, and to maximize the possibility that we can achieve both the widest reach of opportunity and highest levels of excellence.”  In short, Plant said, “We must recognize two distinct but interrelated imperatives: the provision of access and the pursuit of excellence.” There is no shortage of good ideas in Campus 2020. I want to concentrate today on three of particular urgency:  Facilitating access for students  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 8   A need to celebrate -- and capitalize on -- the differences among our post-secondary components as a way to enhance our position on the global stage, and . . . . .  Finally, a push to bring research support to nationally and internationally competitive levels  The access part is, in a way, straightforward – at least, it’s straightforward for a government that is content to expand its spending on education. Plant recommends a fundamental review of student aid schemes. My own view is that we have come to rely too heavily on loans to support Canadian students. This approach disproportionately discourages the first generation of university learners in families, because they tend to be more risk-averse, having not yet internalized the benefits of higher education.  We are working hard at UBC to increase our levels of scholarship and bursary support, although we cannot create this  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 9  change on our own. The province and the federal government need to take a hard look at the effects of current student aid policies. It’s an incalculable social cost when otherwise capable young people are diverted from higher education. Access is not solely a money matter, however. One Campus 2020 recommendation I would like to highlight is this: “By 2020, the rate of Aboriginal post-secondary participation and attainment will equal general population rates, and we will have reduced by 50 per cent the proportion of BC adults not achieving high school equivalency by age 30.”  This recommendation effectively points out the breadth of the challenge before us. I can tell you that UBC has, on several occasions, set ambitious goals for increasing the rate of Aboriginal students pursuing a post-secondary education. And I can also tell you that we have, so far, fallen short.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 10  Still, we have found that it is not enough for us to say that we will open our doors. We need to ensure that Aboriginal people have access to quality education from the earliest moment. We must ensure a level of accessibility and quality through every level of the education system – and in every community – if we are to hope that all of our communities will share in the bounty that follows successful post-secondary study.  Across Canada, the population of aboriginal youth is growing at a far higher rate than youth in the general population. Canada – and BC in particular – simply cannot afford to squander the talents of more generations of young aboriginals.  We need to support populations at risk. We need to provide opportunities for them to learn where they live. And we must help to lift their expectations. It should not be acceptable, in this rich and privileged society, that any capable person should reach the age of 30 without having achieved a high school equivalency.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 11  I also want to be clear that, in addressing this particular point, I am not trying to shuffle off the challenge to another institutional level. UBC can lend critical assistance to educators, at every level, who are trying to engage and inspire young students from every B.C. community. If there are issues in education in any corner in British Columbia and in any part of the education system, our experts should be there to help.  The second matter of urgency that Mr. Plant addresses is the need for a differentiated view of our higher education system. The point, I believe, is this: If we hope to be influential on a world stage – if we hope, for example, that Canadian universities will be able to hold their own in an innovation contest with Berkeley, the University of Tokyo, or Cambridge, let alone the up-and-coming institutions in China and India -- we must make sure to focus some resources on a limited number of globally relevant, researchintensive universities in this country. We must invest in the  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 12  remarkable undergraduate and graduate students who gravitate, quite naturally, to places where they think they can achieve their very best.  I am, on one hand, proud that I can put UBC in that category. We boast amongst the most demanding academic standards in Canada. The best global surveys of leading universities consistently rank UBC among the top 40. Only two Canadian universities can make that claim.  On the other hand, this is just not good enough. Given the level of investment taking place in countries as diverse as Australia, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK, we will need a concerted effort by government – and by our private-sector and philanthropic supporters – just to stay relevant in that larger international class.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 13  But I believe – and Geoff Plant seems to agree – that we should be aiming higher. We should be aiming for the top of the league of influential research universities – and that will demand a much greater commitment than Canada and Canadians have yet demonstrated.  To achieve that goal – to imagine a future in which ANY Canadian university could truly pronounce itself one of the very best in the world – we would need an enthusiastic commitment from the provincial government and an equal willingness at the federal level to bolster the national research agenda.  Specifically, at the provincial level, we would have to take Geoff Plant’s advice and concentrate spending on research and research infrastructure in major centres of excellence. Rather than spreading research funding around in an unstructured and misguided effort to be fair – to provide a bland level of sameness in all regions of the province and the country – we must spend  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 14  strategically on institutions that are legitimately able to compete on the international stage.  Politically, this is where things start to get sticky. Let me give you an example.  I was talking about all this a few weeks ago with Gary Mason, the West Coast columnist for the Globe and Mail. I suggested that Canada would have an opportunity to promote only a few international leaders among universities and I said that UBC was a logical choice to be one of those leaders.  Being a good reporter, Mason sought out the views of my friend Dave Turpin, the President of the University of Victoria. Turpin’s response was brilliant. He said: “Excellence should be rewarded. It shouldn’t be pre-ordained.” Of course, I agree. The implication, I think, is that President Turpin believes that the  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 15  government shouldn’t compromise UVic’s shot at excellence by showing unearned favouritism to UBC. He is absolutely right.  When I look at what a UVic researcher like Andrew Weaver is doing on climate change – or for that matter, what a Mark Jaccard is doing at Simon Fraser – I couldn’t possibly disagree. My point is not that any government should purport to pick “winners and losers” in higher education. Governments are notoriously bad at that task. Instead, I ask two things:  First, that Canadian society begin to recognize that different universities play different roles. Some are local institutions preparing students primarily for local engagement. Some are national leaders in education and maintain strong, but limited, research programmes. A very few – likely only two or three in Canada – are poised to be major, globally relevant centres of social, cultural, economic, scientific and medical innovation.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 16  Secondly, I ask that government policies do nothing to prevent our top research universities from excelling on the international stage. Right now, they do – because we are so rarely willing to see any concentration of research resources.  Here’s one example: when our brilliant researchers attract federal funding for their research, there is a modest top-up to universities to sponsor the overhead costs of supporting those researchers. That top up is still too small; it still doesn’t recognize the full costs of research. Even worse, however, the more successful a university is in attracting research funding, the lower the rate of the overhead top-up. We punish extraordinary accomplishment. UBC receives 22 cents for every dollar of direct federal research funding. Ontario’s Lakehead University, with one-fortieth the research funding, receives 45 cents on the dollar. Canada must stop this counter-productive policy.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 17  There are myriad points of impact between a globally influential university and its community. There is the opportunity to develop first-rate teaching, as we are doing through the work of Nobel Laureate Carl Weiman’s Science Education Initiative at UBC. There are projects like Martin Davy’s research into drastically reducing harmful vehicle emissions, helping to make Canada’s efforts to address the climate change crisis manageable and affordable. The UBC Learning Exchange links students, staff and Faculty to address the challenges and opportunities of the Downtown Eastside.  The direct economic impact of a research-intensive university like UBC is also impressive. It is fair to say that UBC discoveries can be credited with creating and sustaining the entire BC lifesciences industry cluster – diversifying the BC economy and helping to position the province as an innovation leader.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 18  Even in categories that B.C. business people might think of as “old economy,” a university like UBC can lead in remarkable new directions. In a link between life science and forestry, we have identified the first tree genome and are leading in gene level research on everything from cellulose and lignin contents to longevity. We are on the search for solutions to everything from how to reduce the vulnerability of our forests to risks from pests and climate change . . . . to how to breed trees that yield two-byfours that don’t twist.  At the same time, we continue to answer questions arising directly from the most pressing problems of the day – sometimes including questions that everyone had actually forgotten to ask. There was a great example reported in the last issue of our Faculty of Forestry publication, Branchlines. Assistant Professor Kevin Lyons has recently been running a research project testing mulched wood as a potential surface for all-weather forestry roads.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 19  The construction of logging roads has long been a serious issue, but it’s particularly critical now, as B.C. foresters are hurrying to get access to all the trees killed in the mountain pine beetle infestation. There are a couple of challenges. First, we need to build a lot of roads in a very short time if we are to harvest all of this fibre before it rots where it stands. Second, thanks to the vagaries of geography, there isn’t much gravel available in the dying pine forests, so sourcing conventional road-building material is time consuming and enormously expensive.  Looking at those limitations, Prof. Lyons asked, why not mulch up the trees that you cut for rights-of-way and use the wood chips for a biodegradable roadbed? It’s porous, like gravel, so it won’t wash out in rains the way soil roads quickly do. It also doesn’t tend to shed harmful sediments into streams and rivers.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 20  You wind up with material that is cheap and immediately available. And when you’re done, there is a chance that the reclamation process will all but take care of itself.  The elegance of this idea appeals to me for a couple of reasons. First, it demonstrates how broad a contribution a leading university can make to the B.C. economy. Second, at a time when the environment has become the number one issue for Canadians, UBC is offering solutions that help address one ecological problem – the pine beetle epidemic – without creating another.  My own background in human rights and international law compels me to mention, as well, the role that universities have in dealing with the social and political issues of our time – not to mention the university’s part in contributing to art, entertainment, leisure and overall quality of life. The research is conclusive that the most economically innovative and productive communities all share several  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 21  characteristics. They are peaceful and diverse, tolerant and cosmopolitan. And they have a large population of highly educated people and of highly creative people – poets, painters and writers, as well as MBA grads.  It turns out that scientists and engineers tend to be most productive and creative when they feel safe and secure, and when they are juxtaposed with artists and singers and dancers – when their leisure time is as rich as their time in the lab or at the workbench.  Even without calculating the benefits that come from training generation after generation of young professionals, the crosspollinating effects of living and working near – or within – a highly advanced research organization reveal benefits for those directly involved and for the communities and regions surrounding.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 22  So . . . to close with the third matter of urgency identified in Campus 2020, Geoff Plant has recognized that fact. He has challenged the government to do what it must to ensure that THIS region has the advantages that a competitive research university can create.  Plant says, and I quote, “our research-intensive institutions must continue to be the key incubators of the innovation needed to address our most pressing social and environmental challenges and to develop a strong economy. They must also be places of teaching excellence, and they must be destinations of choice for the best and the brightest students from across the province and around the world.”  To that end, Plant recommends that, beginning in 2010, “B.C. will consistently be one of the three highest spending provinces in terms of provincial support for basic and applied research.”  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 23  And certainly, the province will have to reach more deeply into its pocket to achieve that goal.  I want to emphasize that we at UBC are committed to improving our undergraduate teaching as we raise our research productivity and influence. All across the university we are currently designing programmes to ensure that undergraduates can benefit directly from being at a great research university: More lab time. More research projects. More research assistantships with leading professors. These too require a commitment of intellectual talent and new material resources.  I know that the governmental well is not bottomless. I know that you are all unlikely to run from the room today demanding to pay higher taxes in the interest of supporting the world’s best education system.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 24  But as the government struggles over the coming months and years to address Geoff Plant’s intelligent and balanced report, I hope you will encourage an equally intelligent level of investment in access and in supporting outstanding university research; research that can change the future for all of us.  And when government has to start making the difficult choices about how to share what people sometimes mistake as “largesse,” I hope you will help them understand that good government is not a matter of mindlessly distributing tax money so that it appears to land equally on each constituency and in each region. Good government is about making strategic, focused investments for the benefit of all British Columbians.  So far, UBC, UVic and SFU have all done well with what are by global standards, comparatively modest budgets. I think that Dave Turpin is right to say that “Excellence should be rewarded,” and I think that we have each demonstrated excellence to a  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 25  standard that should make us, and you, proud. But “good enough” will not be good enough for BC’s future. I have just returned from a meeting of university presidents from around the world, held in Tokyo. Our friends in Australia, in Germany, in the US, in the UK, in India, Japan and China are all on the move. They are investing heavily right now in education and innovation.  To stand still, in this global context, is to rapidly fall behind. Already, Canada’s productivity, innovation and social development measures trail our major OECD partners. Angel Gurría has pointed the way out of this dilemma – invest in higher education, the only investment with no diminishing return.  So, stay with us. Support us. When the government is contemplating a necessary increase in research funding, think about the short-term benefits that UBC has proved it can offer to your own businesses – and think about the long-term health of our local society, culture and economy. We have an incredible  Vancouver Board of Trade October 30, 2007; Page 26  advantage in Canada and, especially in British Columbia. We should not give it up by sitting on our hands.  When the government starts talking about giving greater direct support to students – and I hope they start that conversation soon – think about the benefits accruing from that investment. Think about the number of new graduates who will flow into your businesses as potentially great employees. Think, especially about the opportunities that investment will create for a larger pool of promising young people who might not otherwise reach their potential – or help you realize yours.  UBC’s success can and should be the success of every person in BC. With your help, I am confident that it will be. Thank you.  
1.0107483~Great cities and great universities : an address to the Vancouver Board of Trade~Toope, Stephen J.~GREAT CITIES AND GREAT UNIVERSITIES  an address to The Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006, 11:45 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Fairmont Waterfront Hotel  Prof. Stephen J. Toope President The University of British Columbia  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 1  Thank you everyone and good afternoon. Thank you first of all for that generous introduction and thank you for the warm welcome. It’s wonderful, as a newcomer – here in Vancouver and here at the Board of Trade – to be made to feel so welcome.  I also would like to thank the partners from Fasken Martineau DuMoulin for sponsoring this event. It’s great when we students of the law – altogether too famous for our adversarial endeavours – can demonstrate the benefits of working together. I appreciate the support.  Now, I said already that I think it’s wonderful to be here in Vancouver, but I must begin by expanding on that point. I am not merely happy to be here, I am enthused. Of course, a great part of that has to do with the University of British Columbia, about which I hope to slip in a few words in a moment, but I have to say that the city itself holds a fascination for me.  I say that as someone who was not immediately drawn to Vancouver. In fact, on the first four, or maybe five occasions that I visited the wet coast,  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 2  I have to admit that I was less than enthralled. On each of those occasions, I arrived at the beautiful Vancouver International Airport in a fog – from which I never really emerged. And the fog wasn’t in here – it was out there…  The thick, grey clouds didn’t just hang over the city; they nestled right down among the homes and the highrises. And when I went outside, I couldn’t tell if it was raining or if the moisture was just so thick in the air that it was condensing on my body as I walked.  It was clear that Vancouverites were proud of their city. People would proclaim its splendor. They would say that, usually, you could see the most beautiful range of mountains over there – or perhaps, over there – and I would pretend to believe them. Returning to my then home at the foot of the small hill known as “Mont Royal” was almost a relief, providing as it did an end to the foggy suspense.  And then it happened, the blinding insight. I had just flown in from Indonesia, a country that faces huge challenges in terms of the rule of law and the protection of human rights. I had been in the capital city of Jakarta, a  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 3  fascinating but dirty and dangerous place by any standard, and I was exhausted and a little depressed – despondent about what Canada might actually do to help in Indonesia.  I woke up, in this very hotel, not knowing that the weather had broken overnight; not knowing that a cool, crisp and crystal clear February dawn had already broken over the North Shore mountains. Throwing open the curtains, I found that there is nothing that could prepare you for that view – and no words to do it justice.  But Vancouver is more than an average city in a spectacular setting. It’s a great city. Even better, it’s a great Canadian city, which almost by definition makes it the envy of most of the rest of the world. We began here with a fabulous location and an embarrassment of natural riches. We overlaid a history of democracy and a firm rule of law – that healthy Canadian tradition.  Then, on that foundation, we have built – you have built – great economic strength and a multi-cultural urban laboratory. As you undoubtedly know, city planners come here from all over the world to see  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 4  what you have done – to study this example of what a city can do with its built infrastructure, how it can reconcile high density with a livable streetscape, how it can tackle the always difficult issues of urban transportation. As we saw again at the recent World Urban Forum, Vancouver is a model, for Canada, for North America and for the world.  I argue that you could not have built this city or this region to its current splendor alone – you could not have done it nearly so well without The University of British Columbia. You couldn’t have done it without doctors and lawyers, without architects and engineers, without teachers and social workers, without actors and musicians, without all the people who have earned an excellent education on the Point Grey peninsula.  Nor would Vancouver be a model of urban development without the input of UBC’s School of Community and Regional Planning. It would not be one of the top 10 life science centres in the world without the work of UBC scholars like Julia Levy and David Dolphin.  I’m sure that you know that already. Certainly no one has been keeping it a secret that roughly 120 companies have spun off from UBC  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 5  research in the last 20 years, or that 2,000 people now enjoy some very highend employment as a result. Many of you will already have heard, for example, about the recent deal that the UBC spin-off Neuromed Pharmaceuticals signed with Merck & Co. – a record-setting collaboration worth $500 million.  Universities are essential to both economic and social innovation. They are incubators of ideas; incubators of companies; and incubators of social change. That is why universities are fundamental to the health of our society.  Great cities, in the modern age, need much more than a resource base or a big employer. As the American academic Richard Florida has noted, they need three things: a well-educated workforce; a creative environment; and, ideally, a multi-cultural mix – a high degree of ethnic and social diversity. Clearly, Vancouver has the third characteristic – ethnic and social diversity – in spades. And, I would argue that fortunately, UBC can be counted upon to help provide the other two – to top up the well of creativity and to provide a flow of the best-educated university graduates in the land.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 6  But there is a degree to which Vancouverites – and I mean greater Vancouverites, because UBC belongs as much to the students and citizens of Fort Langley and South Surrey as it does to our more immediate neighbours in Kerrisdale or on Commercial Drive – Greater Vancouverites have not entirely embraced their university in the way that Bostonians embrace Harvard or Edmontonians embrace the University of Alberta. Let’s change that.  I got the first sense of the challenge when I had just arrived, only three months ago, and a radio host asked me if I considered myself the CEO of UBC, or the mayor.  It was a great question, and the simple answer is that while I fulfill the function of a CEO, I really think of myself as the Chief Academic Officer – which is not to displace the Provost and Vice-President Academic, but rather to affirm that UBC’s academic accomplishments are my highest priority.  But the question was also interesting for what it said about UBC as an entity on the edge of Vancouver, rather than being a part of the fabric of the city itself.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 7  There are some historical contributors to this perspective. There is the status of the university as a provincial responsibility, outside the auspices of Vancouver’s municipal government. There is its de facto existence as some kind of gentrified industrial park – in the daytime, the third-largest employer in the province; at night, a relatively barren institution, a place from which most people have been decanted. That tidal cycle in turn has created a host of unneighbourly issues, not least of all, a problem of traffic ebbing and flowing through adjacent communities.  I’m delighted to find that UBC is already making headway addressing some of these issues. The University Town residential developments now under construction or in the planning stage will knit UBC more effectively into the community. There will be much more housing available for UBC faculty, staff and students. And there will be many more services available, as well, further reducing the need for so many people to be travelling back and forth to other parts of the Lower Mainland. As these new neighbourhoods unfold, UBC will become a more complete community – a small example of the regional town centres that have become a backbone of the GVRD’s Liveable Region strategy.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 8  We also are making excellent – even surprising – progress in dealing with transportation congestion, progress that much outstrips the new housing that we have already made available on campus. Thanks in part to the wisdom of our sustainability-sensitive students to opt for TransLink’s UPass, automobile trips to and from the Point Grey campus have actually dropped by more than 10,000 a day in the last four years, despite the fact that there are more people living on campus.  We appreciate that the transition of UBC to a more balanced, sustainable and integrated community is itself causing some disruption; for example, the construction traffic is a burden on neighbouring streets. But we are moving in a good direction – one that will enhance the physical links between town and gown. Increasing the density of housing on campus for students, faculty, staff, and for other Vancouverites, is the right thing to do; on the west side, UBC wants to be in synch with what Mayor Sam Sullivan calls Eco-Density.  I am sure that there will be continuing discussions, too, on a potential change in local governance models. This is an issue of great interest to the  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 9  university, but a complex one, the details of which will take some time and sincere effort to work out. But I am committed to working them out in a responsible, consultative fashion.  There are three other points of connection between UBC and the community of which we are already very proud. First, I know that the opening of UBC Robson Square five years ago has been a success, creating an essential link and a physical presence for us, our alumni and the Lower Mainland community in the heart of the city. We want to build much more on the platform that Robson Square has given UBC. Parenthetically, lest you think that our move downtown in 2001 was our first urban foray, I would not omit the long and proud history we have with our teaching hospital campuses in the region, and the thousands of physicians who help us train young doctors there, and who conduct approximately one-third of UBC’s total research.  Second, the joint development on Great Northern Way – a collaboration of UBC, SFU, the Emily Carr Institute of Art and BCIT – is also extending our reach and our economic impact into an important part of  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 10  the city to create innovations that extend from the digital media arts to the very frontier of sustainable building construction.  And third, the UBC Learning Exchange has been more than just a very successful experiment – it’s something that really caught my attention when I was considering the prospect of coming here as the new president.  As you may know, the Learning Exchange began in 1999 with 30 students volunteering in 18 Downtown Eastside community organizations. I understand that the first year was a challenge – that residents of the inner city community were skeptical of what kind of help they might expect from pompous academics from the urban fringe.  I also understand that Director Margo Fryer navigated those waters with such sensitivity and good will, that by last year the Learning Exchange had grown to include 1,000 students, engaged in everything from building community gardens to coaching young readers in inner city schools. Many of the students are also earning academic credits in the process. It’s called Community Service Learning and it benefits UBC’s future global citizens as much as it does the community members and groups with whom they  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 11  engage. When I see a program that, for example, empowers Downtown Eastside residents to share their English-language skills with new immigrants, the true meaning of a learning exchange becomes powerfully evident.  I say the Learning Exchange caught my attention because I have long been preoccupied by the Downtown Eastside. From the moment when I first began to discover Vancouver, I have been determined to look at the city – and at all of the city – through an unfiltered lens. Whenever I came for a visit, I would make sure that just as I walked the seawall in Stanley Park or the beachfront in Kitsilano, I would also walk East Hastings. I wanted to be familiar with all of the sights and smells of this city. I took that same walk just before my interview with the UBC Presidential Selection Committee.  As an exercise, it is inspiring in its own way. It is a reminder that great cities don’t stay great without attention – that if we are not all working to make our city greater, it will begin to get worse.  This question – the question whether Vancouver is still innovating or is resting on its laurels – suggests a challenge, for you and for UBC. For  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 12  example, Vancouver has accomplished remarkable things in integrating its diverse ethnic populations. This is a model city for the world and a key social, cultural and economic link between Canada and the Pacific Rim.  But there are opportunities that yet go wanting. I was surprised, for instance, that I couldn’t find a Mandarin class for my children in their West Side schools. They obviously will have an opportunity to hear Mandarin spoken, but not in the classroom.  There is a serious issue there for me – for UBC and for our Education faculty. There is an obvious need for capacity building that we are responsible to fulfill. But first Vancouver has to keep asking itself what kind of city it wants to be. We need to keep innovating if the city is to continue on its path of inclusion and global economic and cultural engagement.  As an Easterner – indeed, a Quebecer – and someone intimately familiar with Ottawa and with Central Canadian myopia, I think Vancouver may be missing another opportunity – may in fact be failing to fulfill another responsibility.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 13  In my first, and admittedly cursory, look at what’s happening here – and from what I knew, or thought I knew, while still a resident of central Canada – I think that Vancouver, and B.C. could be taking a more aggressive role on the national stage.  It is not that the people here are narrow-minded. Vancouverites quickly make the leap from local to global. But there seems a certain lack of interest at the level of the nation. And I don’t believe that it is merely a case of the East not listening – although not listening is a particular specialty among certain Eastern Canadian constituencies. No, I feel there is a degree to which Vancouverites are not so quick to engage – there is a studied detachment – and I think that’s a shame, for B.C. and for the whole country.  We have seen the effect that British Columbians can have on the national stage when they pursue a passion. My friend Philip Owen changed the conversation about injection drugs from coast to coast. Vancouver is still the innovator, but everyone in Canada is following our story. And, of course, Martha Piper was extraordinarily effective in Ottawa, fighting not just for UBC but for post-secondary education across the country.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 14  There are many more innovators, many more important thinkers, many more strategic interveners in this province – and I can tell you, the country needs you. Canada needs ideas and action. Vancouverites, with their two strong universities, are poised to take up the challenge.  Now, students of UBC – by which I mean people who pay attention rather than people who pay tuition – those students of UBC will have noticed that I have come to this point in my speech without doing two things.  First, I have not mentioned how incredibly well the university is doing, as evidenced by its international ranking. This is more and more of a pleasure to talk about as UBC’s stature rises more and more in the world.  For example, UBC is one of only two Canadian research universities that are consistently ranked among the top 40 in the world. UBC has been a strong mid-30s performer in the prestigious Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institute of Higher Education ranking. We recently ranked 27th in the Newsweek survey of the top 50 global universities.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 15  On the question of economic impact – as a measure of how successfully we commercialize our discoveries – an even more recent survey, by a U.S. non-profit think tank called the Milken Institute, pegged UBC as eighth among all U.S. and Canadian institutions. The next closest Canadian institution was McGill at 23rd. UBC’s overall economic impact in the GVRD is worth, at last count, a staggering $3.8 billion and more than 36,000 jobs.  It is tempting for people to dismiss those “boasting rights” as irrelevant to the student experience, but before you do, consider the case of Dr. Carl Wieman, the Nobel-prize winning physicist who is relocating to UBC from the University of Colorado. Dr. Wieman was looking for a place to teach science – looking for the best place he could to do research and to re-think the teaching of science – and he chose UBC, because he was impressed with our record and he was convinced by our commitment.  Clearly, last year’s boasting rights contribute greatly to next year’s success stories.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 16  The second thing I haven’t done yet is to mention UBC Okanagan, which itself is a remarkable success story. Fabulous though UBC’s Vancouver campus may be, there are things that it can’t easily do.  It is a challenge, for example, even with the leadership of people like Carl Wieman, for UBC Vancouver to nimbly implement creative and innovative programming at the undergraduate level. When you have 43,000 students, you make changes carefully and only when you can be sure that the new programs are tried and true.  But UBC Okanagan, a fully fledged graduate institution with the scale and feel of an intimate undergrad college, will allow us incredible scope to develop the best and most creative undergraduate programs in the country.  The vision in Kelowna – from the outset – was to build a Canadian equivalent to the best small, private U.S. graduate institutions. Looking at the quality of new faculty who we have recruited from around the world in the last year alone, I believe that vision is not just possible, but on the way to becoming a reality.  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 17  I left UBC Okanagan to this late point because, in a way, it is an Okanagan story, and one I was happy to share with the Kelowna Chamber of Commerce last week. But it is also a Vancouver story: 31 per cent of the 1,700 first-year students at UBC Okanagan this year come from right here in the Lower Mainland. We are obviously building a new institution that can respond to the needs of people across British Columbia and beyond. Already, 5% of UBC O students come from outside Canada.  I want to say again how delighted, how honoured I am to be here with you today and how lucky I feel to be at UBC. The next few years are destined to be among the most exciting in the history of the city of Vancouver. I have read and heard a great deal about the transformation that occurred here as a result of Expo ‘86 and I can already see the next transformation in process. UBC is proud to be an Olympic partner and a very fortunate beneficiary of the Olympic legacy with the new facility being built for the hockey tournament.  As I have suggested, two of my highest priorities are ensuring that your children get the best education available anywhere in the country –  Vancouver Board of Trade October 5, 2006; Page 18  anywhere in the world – and enhancing the connections between UBC and its neighbouring communities, in the Lower Mainland and in the Okanagan.  If you have problems, if you have complaints, if you have particularly gifted nieces or nephews – or if you come suddenly into a large amount of money that desperately needs to be spent on world-class teaching and research – please call me. UBC can only be great if it has challenges to meet. Vancouver and Vancouverites are at the heart of our inspiration. We are here to serve – and we couldn’t feel more fortunate to do so. UBC and Vancouver – together we can build an extraordinary society that is the envy of the world. Let’s make it happen.  Thank you very much.  
1.0107470~Canadian universities and a new internationalism, SSHRC breakfast session, Congress 2008~Toope, Stephen J.~CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES AND A NEW INTERNATIONALISM  SSHRC Breakfast Session 2008 Congress June 5, 7:30-8:30 am  Remarks by Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  1  Internationalism is of its nature about crossing borders. Yet paradoxically nothing makes me feel more Canadian, more circumscribed, than when I go across an international border. At such moments one feels one’s national identity very intensely. One may experience other emotions too—guilt, perhaps, if you didn’t tell the exact truth on your customs declaration, or boredom, or impatience at yet another bureaucratic obstacle; but of necessity one is reminded of the particularities of place of birth, citizenship, home address—the details that make us unique and different from everyone else. Borders can shape identity, but they do so, often, by constraining it – pushing it into pre-established molds, and creating a sense of difference.  Difference is something we learn to fear. I’m not speaking of biological instinct here, but rather the fear of different cultures, languages, and beliefs that we acquire through upbringing, education, and social environment. We may be born with an  2  innate fear of the dark; but we are not born hating or fearing people of a different colour or religion—sadly, such feelings are nurtured in us through the thousand influences that are at play during our childhood and adolescence.  The fears that can be generated by difference are at work in our own country. Canada prides itself on social understanding, on promoting diversity and multiculturalism; yet we have the recent experience of the Bouchard-Taylor Commission in Quebec before us, which suggests that many people in that province regard immigrants with suspicion and distrust. We know that for many immigrants, the door on employment or educational opportunities is only slightly ajar, and complaints about excessive “accommodement” of those who arrive with different customs or beliefs are rampant.  The rest of Canada should not feel superior to Quebec in this regard, though to my vast annoyance, it often does. British 3  Columbia is perhaps the most multi-racial society in the country, yet its history is sadly reflective of racism and chauvinism, largely directed at minority groups of colour from east and south Asia. And uncomfortably close to home, there is the history of Canada’s treatment of its indigenous peoples, a history marked by betrayal and by the sense of moral and social superiority underlying colonial expansion. That is a history that continues to dog us, and that we are attempting – often feebly – to expiate today.  We cannot afford to ignore such failures; and as the world shrinks through technological advances in transportation and communications, we are learning—slowly but surely—the importance of overcoming our differences in an attempt to change the pattern of suspicion, hostility, and aggressive conflict that has characterized the relationship between states and between peoples over recorded history.  4  For we are beginning to recognize that the nations and peoples of the world face common enemies—enemies of their own creation, perhaps, but nevertheless enemies that we must work together to overcome: environmental degradation and climate change; the pollution of our atmosphere by excessive use of fossil fuels; the destruction of the ozone layer and the consequent increase of cancers around the world; the world-wide epidemic of AIDS; the spreading gap between rich and poor, a gap often created by oppression and the abuse of human rights; threats posed by the drug culture to social order in many countries; the depletion of our oceans by over-fishing—this list could go on and on, but I think my point is clear. These are enemies that, whatever their origins, know no national borders.  Retreating within our borders and shutting out everyone from elsewhere—that may seem like a natural response to such threats to our well-being; and indeed, we are seeing some countries adopting this kind of fortress mentality. But that is precisely the 5  wrong thing to do. Only by opening our borders, by inviting new ideas and sharing our discoveries, can we hope to find solutions to the problems we face together.  In the development of such solutions, post-secondary education has an enormous role to play. In the western world, universities have become the principle engines of discovery in almost every field, and it is no exaggeration to claim that if we are to find the solutions to the social, economic, and environmental problems that loom over us, it is our universities that will almost certainly provide them. Government has recognized this, pouring billions of dollars into research infrastructure over the last decade and making it possible for Canadian universities to recruit researchers of the highest calibre.  The result is that we no longer worry so much about the “brain drain,” because many of our best researchers now choose to stay in Canada, assured of the kind of support that earlier they 6  might only find abroad. And equally satisfying is the fact that Canadian universities are today attracting some of the best scholars from around the world. This is the kind of intellectual internationalism that has always characterized universities at their best: the search for knowledge should never be circumscribed by borders or nationalities  But the universities’ role is not limited to research and discovery. We also have a responsibility to disseminate knowledge, the skills necessary to apply that knowledge, and the ethical principles governing its application. That responsibility does not stop at our borders. In its strategic planning document, Trek 2010, UBC has acknowledged the importance of internationalization as a policy in higher education. In part, the text reads:  In a world where countries are increasingly interdependent, we share a common responsibility to protect and conserve 7  natural resources, promote global health and well-being, and foster international cooperation.  In line with this principle, UBC has set out to establish an international presence through exchange agreements, overseas recruitment drives, and research partnerships with foreign universities. Between 1997 and 2007, for example, we tripled the number of international students in our graduate and undergraduate programs, from just 2000 to almost 6000; and we now have robust exchange agreements with many foreign universities under our student mobility plan, Go Global.  Cynics might observe that international students pay higher fees, and bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped institutions. There is some truth in such a view—a pretty strong connection exists between enrolment and revenues, as everyone here understands; but at UBC—and indeed, at most other Canadian universities that I am familiar with—the pursuit of international 8  students is linked to a recognition that, if we are to gain credibility and recognition for our teaching and research, we must become part of the network of learning that encompasses the globe. And in large part that means fostering diversity and global awareness at home, by attracting good students from abroad. One means of fostering diversity is to bring Canadian and international students together through the experience of residential life: since 1993 UBC has established agreements whereby students from Ritsumeikan University in Japan, Korea University, and Tec de Monterrey in Mexico live in dedicated residences with an equal number of Canadian students for the time that they study here. Next year we will open another such residence in partnership with Hong Kong University. Foreign students help to “internationalize” us internally, which is a real benefit to our classes by enriching debate, and to our professors and students by opening up new perspectives.  9  Successful though such measures may be, much more must be done to open up Canadian universities to scholars and students from other countries. The fact is that we need to internationalize if we are to achieve and maintain the standing we aspire to as research institutions. Our research productivity is already dependent on international input: a bibliometric analysis of Canadian research publications across a wide range of fields shows that currently 40% of the papers by Canadian authors have foreign co-authors, many of them graduate students, with BC leading Canada in this regard.  So the internationalization of our campuses is in our own best interests. Other countries have also recognized this truth faster than us, and are doing more than Canada to attract foreign graduate students. Australian universities receive funding support to enable them to recruit abroad, and successful applicants receive visas quickly. A number of American, British, and Australian universities are setting up English-language branches in countries 10  like China, Singapore, and India; Nottingham University has campuses in China and Malaysia, and New York University is establishing a campus in the Emirates.  I do not favour building campuses abroad, because I do not think that in most cases they will attract the best scholars; nor will they help to develop indigenous talent. In fact, in many cases, they are a new form of colonialism.  Yet such initiatives do raise the  international profiles of the participating universities, and enable them to participate more easily in international research networks. I prefer to work through consortia and to create robust partnership arrangements with sister universities in other countries. Here at UBC we have ventured rather hesitantly into foreign markets: we have an active Asian-Pacific Regional Office serving UBC students and alumni in Hong Kong, and we are participants in the APRU consortium of leading Asia-Pacific Universities and in Universitas 21, a consortium of research universities that has sought to develop some joint programmes aimed at a global 11  market, and strong exchange arrangements for faculty and students.  Overall, however, Canadian efforts in internationalization have not been impressive. In 2005, 30% of graduate students in the US were non-US citizens. For the same period in Canada, only 18% of graduate students were non-Canadian citizens. The figures for international visa-holding doctoral students as a percentage of all doctoral students in Canada have fluctuated widely, from a high of 25% in 1993 to a low of 15% in 2001. By 2004 the number had recovered somewhat, to 23%. But remember that this was in the immediate aftermath of September 11th – when access to the dominant US schools was limited. We utterly failed to seize that moment of opportunity. But other countries did not fail.  The figure for MA students is not very encouraging either, although there was an increase from 8% in 1995 to 14% in 2003. The inverse problem is also serious for Canada. We are, 12  unfortunately, far below what we as a country should be doing to fund international study, sending only about 2.2% of our university students abroad.  What should we do to improve these numbers? Most Canadian universities have been attempting to increase funding support for their foreign students, though we are still well below the levels of scholarships and bursaries offered in the U.S. Work restrictions on international students and their spouses have been relaxed, as have residence requirements, for which I think that we should all be grateful to the federal government. I hope that the 2008 Budget announcement creating Vanier Scholarships will signal a new recognition of the need to compete aggressively for outstanding international graduate students. The Canada Graduate Scholarship top-up to allow Canadians to spend time outside Canada is also welcome, though it is as yet little more than a pilot program. I also hope that we—that is, Canadian universities as a group—can persuade the federal government to fund international 13  recruitment programs, similar to the practice in Australia and the UK.  Important as such measures may be, more is at stake here than merely our success in the international competition for new students from abroad. Through their research, particularly in the social sciences and humanities, as well as through foreign exchanges and partnerships, Canadian universities can—and sometimes do—exert an influence on the shaping of national policy. Governments at both the regional and federal level look to universities to provide them with the kind of insights that can help direct our political and economic relations with other countries.  More concretely, the increasingly international focus of our universities strengthens our nation’s links with potential overseas partners. Canadian-educated Chinese or Korean business people can provide powerful connections with growing Asian markets that might otherwise remain closed to Canadian enterprises. Such links 14  have far-reaching implications for the health of our own economy by making it possible for us to participate in growth and development abroad.  And exporting our expertise is not limited to the areas of business or industry: in one form or another Canadian universities are already working with international agencies to improve the health and living conditions of citizens in many countries around the world. Just one example of this kind of international cooperation is offered by an initiative based in UBC’s Centre for International Health, which is helping to coordinate a project that links universities and research centres in Ecuador, Canada, Cuba, and Mexico for the purpose of helping Ecuador learn to manage its emerging environmental health needs. You could all name other such projects, I am sure.  These kinds of projects reflect a growing sense that universities have a strong role to play in furthering the goals of 15  social justice, both at home and abroad. At UBC we speak somewhat idealistically of educating future “global citizens” who will work towards the attainment of a sustainable and equitable future for all. In practical terms this means encouraging the development of courses and programs emphasizing global awareness and civic engagement. At UBC a thousand students each year volunteer their services through our Learning Exchange, helping marginalized members of our downtown east side develop their skills and enjoy learning opportunities that would otherwise be denied them by their circumstances.  University teachers and researchers are increasingly conscious that they and their students have the power to make things better—that their work can actually resound in the world beyond the laboratory, the library and the classroom. In the past some colleagues used to argue that the university should remain detached from the hurly-burly of everyday life, that like the three Chinese figures in Yeats’s poem “Lapis Lazuli” we should sit on 16  the mountain and look down “on all the tragic scene” as if we had little or no connection with it; today many of my colleagues recognize a different truth, that we must immerse ourselves in that world and help it overcome its tragedies.  It is becoming more and more important for the countries of the world to transcend their own borders and collaborate on environmental, economic, and social issues that would otherwise pose a real threat to global health and well-being. I include in such collaborations the creation of global norms in the area of human rights: it is becoming increasingly important that states work together to establish the moral and legal foundation for a body of international law capable of protecting people against threats to their rights by corrupt, weak, or indifferent regimes. If the spirit of internationalism is to have any real meaning, countries must learn to build on shared understandings of what is right and acceptable, the value of public education, the importance of free speech in a free society, and so on. 17  Universities are founded upon such ideas, and exist to preserve and disseminate them. It is to our universities that we should look for leadership in promoting a new spirit of internationalism; they can play a significant role in helping to bring this about by developing joint research projects with overseas partners, by promoting the ideals of global citizenship through focused programming, by encouraging domestic students to take greater advantage of the many opportunities offered by international exchanges, and by increasing the number and value of graduate scholarships for international students.  Crossing borders can mean simply the act of peering briefly into the way other people live, “faire du tourisme,” a journey that always ends where it began. Or it can mean a more difficult voyage, one in which we transcend social or political barriers to offer others the benefits of our research and learning, and to learn  18  from their work—thus making it possible for us to effect positive changes in their and our lives. Thank you.  19  
1.0107508~Life Sciences British Columbia breakfast~Toope, Stephen J.~Life Sciences British Columbia Breakfast 15 October 2010 Professor Stephen J. Toope  Thank you for inviting me to be with you here today. I not only get to share the first meal of the day with you, but to share some economic data that I hope will perk you up as much as this morning’s coffee.  Your LSBC brand is “Growing BC’s Bio-Economy.” That’s an aspiration that we share. We share so much more, of course, and as partners, we are making a huge difference to our province, our nation and – because what we do best always has global implications – our world.  A little history. It’s customary for a university president to commission an economic impact study of his or her institution every decade or so. The point is generally to reassure government funders that their investment is being stewarded wisely.  About a year ago, I saw that UBC’s last study was coming up to its bestbefore date, so I spoke with economist Walter Sudmant, Director of UBC’s  Planning and Institutional Research division, and commissioned a new study. But the document he handed me at the end of a year’s work was not an update of the previous study. It was a whole new animal.  Sudmant used a formula developed by economist Fernand Martin to measure Canadian university R&D at a national level, and which had so far been applied institutionally only by the University of California. So the report I held in my hands included something that had never before figured into a Canadian university impact study: the economic impact of new knowledge created at UBC.  I was stunned. For the first time, we could consider—and measure—not just the economic impact of UBC’s corollary activities as an employer and a purchaser, but also the impact of our core business: higher education and knowledge creation. The idea is revolutionary. Moreover, the numbers are astonishing. They indicate that UBC is not merely an economic player, but a driver, and that the magnitude of impact occurs not in spite of the University’s core business but because of it.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 2  The economic impact study of the University of British Columbia that we did last year shows that UBC’s measurable contribution to the economy of the Province of British Columbia in the previous year was ten billion, fiftyseven million dollars—or roughly five percent of the provincial economy. By way of a benchmark, that’s above Mining, and Oil & Gas Extraction and just below Construction. By way of another benchmark, provincial funding for UBC for this time period was roughly one billion dollars. So what we’re looking at for 2008/2009 is a government spending multiplier … of 10.  What’s even more radical than that multiplier number, though, is the character of the multiplier as it’s applied to the University’s core business. It’s this factor that changed my view of UBC’s economic role and will, I hope, change yours.  I’d like to walk you briefly through the key components of the formula that led to that ten-billion-dollar result. And then what I really want to focus on is the last: research.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 3  So the formula. The 2009 study measured the following dimensions of economic impact:  First, UBC’s direct spending in the local economy—salaries, books, capital spending. Using a standard, conservative multiplier—in other words, a Keynesian multiplier—of 1.5, the impact of direct spending was $1.9 billion.  Second, non-university spending that would not have occurred without UBC’s presence, including student and visitor spending. Again using a standard multiplier of 1.5, indirect spending totaled $618 million.  Third, the effect of higher earnings. Full-time workers with bachelor’s degrees earn 57 percent more than those who have not completed university. What’s more, UBC produces all BC-trained doctors, dentists, physical therapists, pharmacists and midwives, and about three quarters of all BC-trained engineers and other professionals, so the 57 percent differential is conservative for UBC graduates. Netting out the actual cost of education, the impact of increased income for UBC alumni was $2.6 billion.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 4  That puts us at five billion and some millions—and we still have one more category to go, and it’s one that will have direct relevance to LSBC members and the innovation impacts that you are bringing to our economy:  Research. The creation of new knowledge. Ideas and innovations that become part of the curriculum, or part of the vernacular, in classrooms, communities, and corporations from that point forward. The creation and transmission of new knowledge increases the productive capacity of the region and nation, and in doing so, it fundamentally alters the very nature of the economy. The standard Keynesian multiplier just does not apply.  So instead, we used Fernand Martin’s formula. Here’s why. It’s long been observed that there is a substantial component of economic growth that cannot be explained by growth in inputs. Labour and capital both have become more productive for reasons not accounted for. Evidence shows that this additional productivity is the result of innovation, or “technical change,” resulting from the research and development of new products and processes. The effect of innovation is not static but rather dynamic, in  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 5  that a new communications technology or a viral gene sequence fundamentally alters the way things are done. Moreover, the productivity contributions of knowledge are not single-year effects, but become permanent sources of GDP either until that knowledge is supplanted by new knowledge, or in perpetuity. And finally, research and development in British Columbia is conducted to a disproportionately high degree by UBC.  When all of these factors are accounted for, the impact of UBC research and development—core University business—on the British Columbia economy is $4.96 billion.  The characteristics that have led us to become one of the top-ranked universities in the world are in fact the same characteristics that have led us to become an economic driver for British Columbia. An outstanding innovation record. Students, staff, and faculty who could go anywhere in the world but choose UBC. And the exceptional quality of our research. Let’s take a closer look.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 6  A top-tier, research-intensive university—and particularly UBC—is necessary to the strength and success of a regional economy by virtue of three key characteristics: 1. We are an impetus for the innovation that drives productivity growth in British Columbia and Canada; 2. We help create a provincial climate and geography of innovation that attracts the world’s top talent; and 3. Our core contributions to the economy are not static but dynamic inputs, or innovation inputs, the impact of which continues over time.  Impetus for innovation. Geography of innovation. And innovation inputs. Let’s start by looking at the Impetus for Innovation.  Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, has quoted Peter Nicholson of the Council of Canadian Academies saying, “innovation is … the main driver of productivity growth and is thus the principal source of national prosperity.” Calling innovation an economic rather than a purely scientific activity, he then said, “Canada has a serious productivity growth  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 7  problem” and commented on the fact that “Canada’s business sector on the whole … is lagging in innovation relative to many of our peer[s].” He called on businesses to put in place the strategies that would allow them to foster innovation.  Closer to home, the BC Technology Industry Association has called on industry and government to create a joint strategy for the technology sector that includes a healthy innovation pipeline and ecosystem.  The World Bank’s 2009 report on establishing world-class universities called for a national innovation system that could translate research into societyready products and services efficiently and competitively.  And in the forthright words of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, “We might be able to stimulate our way back to stability, but we can only invent our way back to prosperity. We need everyone at every level to get smarter.”  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 8  That’s a lot of powerful voices in a lot of places calling for much the same thing. Let me tell you about the impetus UBC is providing in answer.  Thirty-seven percent of all research and development in British Columbia takes place in universities and almost entirely in the four research-intensive universities: UBC, Simon Fraser, UVic and UNBC. But fully seventy percent of university research takes place at UBC. That means UBC is responsible for over a quarter of all research in the province. Compare that with the University of California, where only seven percent of R&D in California takes place at all of the U of C campuses combined. BC is highly dependent on UBC as the leading conduit for the injection of innovation into the economy, and Canada as a whole is far more reliant on its universities than is the US.  Canadian industry doesn’t have the research power enjoyed by American firms, but Canadian universities do. Over $40 million in research activity at UBC is contracted, and directly funded, each year by private sector firms that are using UBC as their research arm.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 9  UBC stands among the top 10 universities in North America in terms of the ‘patent pipeline,’ a sophisticated measure of commercialization of research. At $13.6 million at last count, UBC licensing revenue exceeded all other Canadian universities by a wide margin; Calgary was next at $4.9 million. BC’s biotech cluster is made up of about 100 companies employing 2,600 people, and is the seventh largest in North America. It is primarily spun out of UBC. UBC currently ranks 23rd in science and engineering publications in North America, and with the highest publications growth rate of any university in North America, is fast climbing that list.  I said a few minutes ago that I want you to see UBC with new eyes. UBC as an impetus for innovation in partnership with BC business is one of the reasons why.  Economists are paying considerable attention to the effects of creativity, authenticity, well-being, and diversity on the long-term economic health of companies and countries. Moreover, economists such as Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen as well as UBC’s own John Helliwell are  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 10  redefining what we mean by long-term economic prosperity and how we measure it. Stiglitz says we must add measures of happiness, health, and well-being to our traditional consideration of GDP. Helliwell has proven the link between happiness, and productivity and profitability. Even more relevant for today is that Helliwell and others have demonstrated clear causal links between education and happiness.  Dave Mowat, CEO of ATB Financial and former CEO of Vancity Credit Union, has said, “You can draw a direct, straight-line relationship [from happy people] to the financial success of your company.” I’m drawing another straight line: from UBC’s core business to well-being and happiness, in our regional economy and beyond.  Economist Richard Florida shows a clear correlation between the presence of a talented “creative class,” the strength of a region’s technology sector, and the region’s overall economic success. He focuses on the ability to attract talent, saying, “Smart people are the most critical resource to any economy …. By attracting [the smartest people from around the world] and rapidly and widely disseminating the knowledge they create, universities  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 11  will have a much greater effect on the nation’s economy as well as regional growth.”  So what’s the secret to attracting talent? How do you keep people happy? Because I agree -- patents and licensing fees are all very well, but it’s estimated that 73 percent of new knowledge generated by university research is transmitted into the economy through its graduates. Which means we need smart people here in BC who are happy to stay.  Helliwell says it’s things like trust; strong networks with family, friends, and community; and freedom from discrimination. Florida flips this last around, saying that successful places are those that encourage diversity, “plug-andplay communities where anyone can fit in quickly …, find opportunity, build support structures, be themselves, and not get stuck in any one identity.” He adds that while a solid business climate will always be important, “having an effective people climate is even more essential.”  It’s no coincidence that UBC’s new strategic plan names an exceptional learning environment as its overarching goal, with sustainability, inter-  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 12  cultural understanding, and an outstanding work environment among the key strategies aimed at achieving it. As the province’s largest university and second-largest employer, UBC as a place helps define BC as a place for an enormous number of people. UBC’s new brand, which you may have begun to see in some creative new video spots on your favourite news channel, captures this idea of a geography of innovation in its tagline: a place of mind. We want to communicate here at home, throughout BC, and around the world, that UBC is a place where every student, staff and faculty member, alumnus, and community member can learn, discover, and contribute in his or her own way. In class, in the community, online, or from wherever you may be in the world. Even … from here.  Impetus for innovation. Geography of innovation, or a place of mind. And last but not least, innovation inputs. On this, I’d like to share some stories with you.  Story #1: Pulp Non-Fiction BC’s 78 mechanical pulp refiners consume 11 percent of the total energy produced in the province. An interdisciplinary team of seven UBC  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 13  researchers along with a consortium of companies that includes BC Hydro and Catalyst Paper launched a $2 million, five-year energy efficiency program to develop technologies aimed at improving production and paper quality while reducing energy consumption. Projected annual savings are $45 million, or a thousand gigawatt hours, enough to power 100,000 homes for a year.  Story #2: Drugs Without Borders On the inspiration of a wonderful UBC student who has gone on to become a Rhodes Scholar, UBC’s University-Industry Liaison Office has developed a Global Access Policy that makes UBC-patented discoveries, including medicines, more accessible in developing countries. In one example, local company iCo Therapeutics Inc. has partnered with the University to advance a new, non-toxic formulation for the treatment of leishmaniasis. In the developing world, this infection attacks two million cancer and AIDS patients a year, and the old drug is difficult to access and highly toxic. UBC’s commercialization agreement with iCo ensures that the new formula will make its way in the world to where it is needed most, at an affordable cost.  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 14  Story #3: 612 Main Not far from here, at the corner of Main and Keefer Streets, UBC’s Learning Exchange storefront offers basic and advanced computer skills classes to residents of the downtown eastside. The program is sponsored by HSBC Bank Canada, as is the ESL Conversation Program, where many of those same residents in turn become volunteer instructors helping new immigrants acquire the skills they need to find work and build a life in BC. Maybe even a life in Life Sciences . . . .  Innovation inputs are those that change the underlying nature of the economy from the moment of discovery forward. They’re the currency of the knowledge economy, and they’re core business for the researchintensive university. Innovation is what UBC and its sister researchintensive universities do. And by all accounts, innovation is what our economy – and your members -- need most.  Thank you for listening to me this morning. Now I’d like to listen to you – your comments and you questions, please. - 30-  Life Sciences BC Speech, October 15, 2010  Page 15  
1.0107502~Stephen Toope (UBC) on global challenges and the organizational-ethical dilemmas of universities~Toope, Stephen J.~Stephen Toope (UBC) on global challenges and the organizationalethical dilemmas of universities Originally appeared in InsideHigherEd, December 5, 2010 By Stephen J. Toope December 5, 2010 2:45 pm EST Last spring, Vice-Chancellor Nigel Thrift of Warwick University posed a profound ethical challenge to universities around the world. He asked if we are appropriately organized to fulfill our contemporary mission. At least since the creation of the land-grant universities in North America it has been received wisdom that universities have three interlocking goals and opportunities: to foster student learning; to preserve and increase the store of human knowledge; and to engage with the wider society. Some commentators like to call contemporary universities “multiversities” because of this complexity of mission, and they note that the goals and opportunities are not invariably in synch, despite the fond wishes of university leaders who suggest that there is an inevitable synergy amongst teaching-researchcommunity engagement. Nigel Thrift‟s welcome challenge is to ask how the three goals of contemporary universities, and especially the goal of community engagement (or „service‟ in its more condescending formulation), might be better pursued. His implicit suggestion, carefully not insisted upon, is that universities might do a better job if they banded together in deeper partnerships to address the great crises of our times. Prof. Thrift focuses upon the example of climate change, and it is a most appropriate choice, being scientifically complex, geographically unfocussed and full of potentially devastating effects. Other contributors to the online dialogue on GlobalHigherEd have advanced other causes eminently worthy of global attention from our universities: pandemic disease, income inequality, pervasive poverty, ideological fundamentalism. I would add, especially for countries of immigration, understanding and fully benefitting from cultural diversity. The superficial answer to Prof. Thrift‟s challenge is obvious. Given that we have not been able to solve our fundamental problems, nor to fully exploit our opportunities, the answer demanded by Prof. Thrift‟s question must be „no‟: universities around the globe are not optimally organized to do what the world needs us to do. I suggest, however, that to figure out a way forward, the primary question needs to be torn apart into a series of related questions. Why are we organized the way we are? How easy will it be to re-organize ourselves? What promising models might be pursued? What are the limits to re-invention? Each of these questions is complex, and I will only be able to trace out some tentative answers in this short response. What is more, the  answers are not always encouraging. So as not to descend into paralysis, however, I will end by joining President Indira Samarasekara in proposing a few concrete ways in which we might improve our collective ability to harness the brains, energy and heart of our universities, to do our fundamental job: helping to make the world a better place through education and research. First a caveat, as I am an academic after all! Ever since becoming a university president, and beginning to read and listen to others of my cohort, I have been struck by a tendency to assume that the world today is entirely different than it was twenty or fifty or a hundred or two hundred years ago. The idea seems to be attractive to some colleague presidents that it is our destiny to fundamentally re-shape what we have inherited. This impulse is often prompted by a sense of frustration with our own faculty members who are accused of not “getting it,” of somehow living in the past. By the way, I do not suggest that Prof. Thrift reveals these tendencies, for I know him to be far more subtle. But it is worth remembering that universities are one of the only social institutions to have survived, both intact and wildly changed, since the medieval era. (Other examples are religious institutions, now under increasing attack, and some political institutions, like the Icelandic parliament). This is no accident. Universities have proven themselves to be crucial to social, economic and cultural evolution. In seeking to promote needed change, we must be careful to acknowledge the strength that we bring to the task. The mix of conservatism and openness that marks universities, probably due in large measure to our commitment to collegial governance, is a remarkable asset, even as I acknowledge that it can lead to frustration, and a failure sometimes to seize the day. The Confines of History and Nation As suggested just above, university organization is very much an inherited trait. Most of us have forms of collegial governance in relation to academic decision-making: senates or governing councils of some kind. They often must work in conjunction with boards whose duties are focused on the financial and property aspects of the university. Professors, even in those places where tenure has not been fully established or preserved, are best thought of as „independent contractors‟; they are certainly not placed within a directive hierarchy. University „management,‟ at least in relation to the academic side of the house, is much more about encouragement and cajoling, and sometimes even shaming, than about „executing to plan.‟ Concrete student expectations tend to be oriented to the short term, like keeping tuition low, improving access to courses, and not being too disrupted by physical changes to the campus, even when student visions are grand, like equality, environmental sustainability and fairness. I doubt that this conundrum has changed all that much in the past couple of hundred years.  Prof. Thrift and other commentators have noted that the nation-based organization of universities is one of the central problems in promoting effective cross-border collaboration. Of course, this too is historically contingent. Just as the law of commerce was once fundamentally transnational (the medieval lex mercatoria), universities, though physically implanted in one place, were deeply cross-cultural. We all know the stories of wandering scholars like Erasmus, who contributed to the academic life of Paris, Leuven, Cambridge, and Basel. Although we are currently experiencing a re-discovery of the basic need for mobility amongst scholars, our national systems are not fully cooperating. There are still many barriers to international recruitment, like impaired transferability of credentials (especially amongst the professions) and narrow-minded visa rules. Moreover, many of our most important funding mechanisms (e.g. national research councils) remain inwardly focused, doing precious little to foster global collaboration. For North American public universities, we are also confronted by sub-national constraints. We are partially funded by state or provincial governments; even recruiting students from a few hundred kilometers away can be controversial. The Risks of Hubris Hubris may be the greatest flaw of universities, especially big ones with strong reputations. We need to recognize that our own brilliant hiring and attraction of „top‟ students cannot of itself create a critical mass of talent sufficient to solve fundamental global problems. We must find partners. We must collaborate, not only with other universities but with community groups, civil society organizations, industry, and government. Even if we are to create effective cross-sectoral collaboration, we must also display some pragmatism, defining our ambitions with realism. „Grand challenges,‟ unless sufficiently specified and broken down, can turn into attempts to boil the ocean. Chasing Ephemera Rather than focusing intently on what needs to be improved in the world, university leadership can become preoccupied with superficial measures of reputation: university rankings; collecting prestigious partners; satisfying consumerist understandings of what student learning is all about. Universities can also find themselves responding to the immediate rather than the important. We are challenged by research funding vehicles that focus on short term wins or immediate political issues. The pre-occupation with „commercialization‟ of research in the first part of this century is a good example, but so too was the rush to create new computer science and electrical engineering spaces for students just as the tech bubble was bursting in the 1990s. Perhaps we should have been pushing for more  geographers, economists, political scientists, and sociologists to help us figure out how to promote a more sustainable world. Models of Collaboration So far, none of the university networks that sprang up at the beginning of this century has fulfilled its promise. Attempts to jump-start research collaboration on crucial issues through these networks have seen modest success at best. Let‟s be honest. Just because presidents and vice-chancellors say they would like something to happen on the research front does not make it happen, even if we can cobble together „seed‟ funding. Research networks typically arise in an organic fashion from the bottom up. Our faculty and graduate students notice good work somewhere else, and they reach out at a conference or online. Exchanges may begin, and true collaboration evolves. Perhaps we can facilitate such organic growth, but we cannot direct it hierarchically. Some research communities, like high energy physics and astronomy, have been very effective at creating multinational networks out of necessity: their need for large facilities. The same trend is now seen in life sciences and clinical research. In other words, researchers will naturally form networks to solve big problems with high infrastructure costs. An example of a strong international research network is the structural genomics consortium, which has a solid base in Canada, but with partners globally. It has attracted significant support for UK partners through the Wellcome Trust, and is well established in Sweden. My own university is involved in outstanding collaborative work in the field of quantum materials with the University of Tokyo and the Max Planck Society. In the field of climate change, which Prof. Thrift focuses upon, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has already created an influential experts group that already includes many university researchers, but we have not been able to link the IPPC effectively with broader university research agendas. We need to learn from successful global collaborations if we are to expand our reach to address the fundamental problems of our era. Possible Ways Forward Build from the bottom up. Where are there research teams, and groups of dedicated and inspired students, who are already working together across borders? Can we support them, and help them find new partners in other places? By starting with small, focused and effective networks we can build up confidence to move to more ambitious global platforms. How do we seek out real commitment to specific efforts, rather than the „why not, we can do that too‟ response? Challenge National myopia. Those of us living and working in the USA or the European Union must make a specific effort to look outside the borders for  partnerships that may be less obvious. Those living in smaller states need to encourage our governments to change rules to allow research funding that crosses borders, even though we may seem like small players. We should encourage national research councils to sponsor joint initiatives. We all must do more to facilitate and fund migration of students and scholars. If university folk get a chance to meet one another informally and over time, the chances of effective collaboration later are significantly enhanced. Communicate authentically about strengths. None of our universities is good at everything. There are many important global issues. Where are we best placed to make a real difference, working with others? In the case of my own university, I suspect that we are most likely to contribute in a major way to global solutions on climate change and sustainability more generally. We could also make a real difference in collaborating on the prevention and control of infectious disease, and in intercultural understanding. Our ability to lead in a global effort to understand and combat ideological fundamentalism is less obvious. Like all universities, our expertise is not entirely balanced across all areas of research. In UBC‟s case, we have deep knowledge of Asia, but have invested little in creating knowledge of the Middle East. This reaffirms the necessity of cooperation. Help our students and alumni become global citizens. In focusing, as we almost inevitably do, on research as a means of addressing global problems, we should never forget that our most important „translators‟ are our graduates. Are our students being exposed to classes in which they really confront the problems of our era? Are we doing enough to help students see how they could make a difference in the world? Are we helping them connect with the wider community during their studies (e.g. through communityservice learning)? Are enough of our students being introduced to perspectives from other cultures, other parts of the world? Walk the talk. Universities must learn to be more Janus-faced. By that, I mean the opposite of hypocritical. If we are really going to address the fundamental problems of global society, we can‟t just research solutions and preach. We need to act on our own campuses, and in our local communities, as well. Are we leaders in economic, environmental and social sustainability? How aggressive are our own greenhouse gas reduction targets? Are we modeling best practices in intercultural dialogue? Do our own workforce practices address issues of income inequality?  
1.0107498~Cultivating research in BC~Toope, Stephen J.~Cultivating Research in BC 23 February 2011 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Thank you, Minister Chong.  Premier Campbell, distinguished colleagues.  Thank you all for this opportunity to be with you again. It‘s an honour and a pleasure. While we’re celebrating excellence in BC research and innovation today, I want to talk about the business of cultivating that excellence. And one word keeps rattling around in my mind:  It’s “fertilizer.”  I don’t want to talk of “fertilizer” as simply a code word for money. And I certainly don’t want you to think of fertilizer as a polite word for stuff people spread around when they don’t care about the truth.  No, I want to talk about fertilizer because of a headline that I read in the Vancouver Sun last week. It read “Fertilizers boost declining BC fish populations”  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 2 of 11  The fertilizer in question is one that was developed out of research conducted at the University of British Columbia, and one that has been commercialized and is being sold worldwide by the Vancouver-based firm Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies.  The research that led to this fertilizer didn’t come from marine biology or environmental science. It is the result of work by a civil engineer, Professor Dan Mavinic. Dr. Mavinic wasn’t trying to develop a fertilizer for fish; he started out looking for a way to prevent sewer pipes from clogging up.  You see, phosphate from our household detergents and other sources creates a sludge that clogs up water treatment pipes and plants. Phosphate is not just a nuisance, of course, it contains phosphorus: an essential component of fertilizer. Together with nitrogen, phosphorus promotes plant growth.  When too much phosphorus leaves our pipes and enters the ocean, it can disrupt the marine food chain so much that oxygen-starved “dead zones” develop, such as a large one in the Gulf of Mexico where fish cannot live. However, when it stays in our pipes it wreaks havoc on our public sewer system and eventually becomes an expensive problem.  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 3 of 11  Dr. Mavinic’s solution enables municipal water treatment plants to run more efficiently and pipes to flow more freely, not by flushing the phosphorus into the ocean, but by harvesting it and processing it into a remarkably pure and highly useful slow-release fertilizer. According to the Ministry of Natural Resource Operations, this slow-release fertilizer is proving to be the best method yet for turning endangered streams into “live zones” that help replenish our threatened salmon and steelhead populations.  Here is a single application of research that solves a costly civil engineering problem, helps prevent one serious environmental condition and offers remediation of another. That’s quite the fertilizer.  How do you create the kind of conditions that foster discoveries like this, that enable unexpected connections, and that offer real economic, social and environmental benefits? Here again, the word “fertilizer” suggests itself. The remarkable 18th Century British playwright and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan famously said “Fertilizer does no good in a heap, but a little spread around works miracles all over.”  Research and innovation in British Columbia has been working miracles all over. I wish I had time to specifically celebrate all the research that is  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 4 of 11  coming out of UBC, UVic, Simon Fraser, UNBC and associated research facilities in our province. I suspect that Drs. Reynolds and Golnaraghi will be able to speak to some of them. There’s a huge amount going on, and it hasn’t happened by chance.  Mr. Premier, you and your government have been instrumental in tirelessly fostering the conditions that allow all this to happen. You have invested steadily in the research agenda in our province, and each and every day we are seeing and experiencing the positive return on that investment.  Rather than talk about the number of metaphorical “miracles” resulting from research across British Columbia, let me give you a sense of their combined magnitude and economic impact. Last year I commissioned a study to measure and understand UBC’s contribution to the economy of our province. That research revealed that UBC’s core activities are responsible for more than $10 billion dollars annually – which is about 5% of the provincial economy. Delving further, we learned that the largest portion, fully half of that total contribution, comes from “new knowledge and knowledge transfer.” Translation: basic research and research applied to practical purposes. From just one of our four major  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 5 of 11  research-intensive universities, $5 billion dollars is added to the economy each year through research and innovation.  Now consider all four of our research-intensive public universities - The Research Universities' Council of British Columbia calculates the total economic contribution from all forms of research at UVic, SFU, UNBC and UBC is just over $ 7 billion dollars. I think it is more than fair to say that research is one of the most important drivers of our economy. One that abundantly rewards the investment put into it. But how can we further maximize this return on investment? This is the question and our challenge moving forward  I like to think of innovation as taking place within a research ecosystem. To explain, let’s look again at Ostara’s fertilizer.  In efforts to rebuild depleted salmon and steelhead populations, Ostara’s slow release fertilizer is being applied at two particular times in the year, in some 15 watersheds and 28 rivers across BC. The fertilizer is not fed to the fish; it’s fed to the streams, with the specific intent of promoting the growth of algae. Algae provide food and habitat for insects; and the insects in turn feed and nourish salmon hatchlings and  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 6 of 11  small fry. The larger those juvenile fish are before they leave for the sea, the better the chances they will survive and return to spawn.  The solution is a very elegant strategy for returning a stream to its natural state and helping the inhabitants of that stream to thrive. The ecosystem is highly interdependent, with each species sensitively linked to the others.  To cultivate the fish you have to look at the whole stream. With research it’s the same (although when we extend the analogy, we generally don’t refer to our research results as “spawning,” ourselves as “small fry” and the fruit of our research “algae”).  To flourish, our research ecosystem must be capable of attracting and supporting the very best minds on the planet. We need to provide them with the resources and conditions to keep them here and to enable them to mature and do their best work. Further still, we need to provide ways to incubate discoveries – grow them into practical ideas, products and enterprises that truly change the game and change the world for the better.  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 7 of 11  Certainly, to do this, we need to attract the “big fish.” After all, top talent is a finite resource in a competitive global marketplace. However, to truly succeed we need to carefully tend to the entire system. Talent needs a habitat rich with complementary talent. Our star researchers need brilliant graduate students, accomplished post-docs and superb junior faculty.  At the University of Northern British Columbia, Dr. Laurie Chan became, in 2006, the BC Leadership Chair in Aboriginal Environmental Health, with a $4.5 million dollar endowment through LEEF BC. Dr. Chan came here via Hong Kong and London. He’s a big fish. He currently supervises 2 post-doctoral fellows and 7 graduate students. Those associates of his are essential to his work, and the inspiration and support they receive working with him gives them the opportunity to mature and grow. The value and impact of their combined research has the potential to expand exponentially over many generations to benefit BC and all of Canada.  The big fish need the right habitat if we are to retain them and if they are to thrive. They need great facilities that enable great minds to do great work. TRIUMF, Neptune, The Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, The Centre for Addictions Research, The Pacific Center for  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 8 of 11  Advanced Materials and Microstructures, the Brain Research Centre.…these and many other important facilities receive significant support from the Province and allow our researchers to focus on their work, not on their surroundings.  It is vitally important that all of these essential research facilities not only exist, but that the entire infrastructure of research receives long term, stable operating funds. Dependable and reliable support allows risk-taking and creativity. This kind of funding isn’t flashy, but it is absolutely essential. Think of it as the slow-release fertilizer that enables the entire ecosystem of research to prosper. Mr. Premier, you get it. You have always thought in the long term, not just in short-term political calculations.  We also need to guarantee an atmosphere of creativity and inquiry. This is the air of academic freedom that research-intensive universities uniquely provide. More often than not the next important discovery comes from somewhere we couldn’t predict – like a clogged, balky municipal water line, as in the case of Ostara. Businesses might find it hard to afford open-ended freedom in research, but working together with universities and government, we can ensure that critical type of research takes place.  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 9 of 11  In an ecosystem of discovery, we need to harvest innovations. Here again government, business and academia need to work together in order to bridge the gap between the breakthrough idea and its commercial implementation.  In British Columbia, the Centre for Drug Research and Development is a wonderful example of how these kinds of collaboration can succeed. The province invested $25 million dollars to help launch the CDRD. It is independent, non-profit organization with a network of affiliations to eight research institutions across British Columbia including UBC, UVic, SFU and UNBC. CDRD’s technical and commercial drug-development expertise and facilities are improving the odds of turning scientific discoveries into marketable treatments for diseases such as bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, Huntington’s disease and diabetes.  The CDRD is skillfully fertilizing a healthy pharmaceutical sector in BC. Just think of the other sectors that could benefit from this kind of care and cultivation.  Before I close, let me add one more element to our research ecosystem. As we pursue research at a level equal to or better than anywhere else on earth, we also need to ensure that our children are  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 10 of 11  able to participate in and benefit from this pursuit. We need to enrich students’ natural curiosity and transform it into a genuine passion for inquiry, helping them develop both the rigor and imagination that characterize great researchers.  Premier Campbell, your government’s proclamation of the Year of Science for this 2010-2011 school year is a wonderful step in encouraging curiosity and interest in science. If we as a province are to fully benefit from our research, we need not only to attract top talent, we also need to grow it right here. This is a responsibility that I feel acutely as a university President, but we know that the job doesn’t start with secondary education. It starts with pre-school.  This is a critical time for us, and there is real opportunity for BC to broaden our reach internationally. Both the US and British public higher education systems are struggling with budget challenges, which means some top-level talent in those markets might be ready for the catch. But at the same time, others are also angling for the big fish, including our own, home-grown ones. We are experiencing competition for talent like never before, from the rapidly developing education system in China and a robust cluster of well-established private universities in the US.  Cultivating Research in BC 23 February, 2011 Page 11 of 11  There’s an old saying, paraphrased from Pliny: “the farmer’s eye is the best fertilizer.” As we celebrate the health and harvest of our research ecosystem here in British Columbia, let us keep our eyes on the whole and on its many interdependent parts. Let us also continue working together to attend to the whole ecosystem. More than anything, let us be ever watchful for new opportunities, so that we may further fertilize and cultivate, in British Columbia, the world’s most attractive, most robust environment for research and the innovations that flow freely from it.  Thank you.  
1.0107504~Universitas 21 global ideas roundtable~Toope, Stephen J.~Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Stephen J. Toope, President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Good afternoon. No doubt you’ve all heard the phrase: “It takes a village to raise a child.” The phrase became part of the mainstream lexicon after the 1994 release of a popular book by children's author Jane Cowen-Fletcher, a former Peace Corps worker in Benin, West Africa. The book is entitled: It Takes a Village, and it tells the story of Yemi, a young African girl who goes anxiously searching for her younger brother Kokou, only to discover that the rest of the village was watching over him all along.  It’s a story that compellingly underscores the practical wisdom of community life. For the purposes of today’s discussion, I want to offer a twist on this time-tested maxim, as follows: It takes a community to foster innovation.  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 2 of 11  If we consider innovation to be a wandering child, then the metaphorical villagers are the essential members of our research communities – academia, governments, industry and civil society organizations. The unfortunate difference, however, is that these community members don’t always accept their roles in raising a child as willingly as the villagers who watched over Kokou.  By now, you’ve likely guessed that my key message is that encouraging greater levels of community collaboration is key to enhancing research productivity in our societies. In so doing, I wouldn’t be telling you anything you didn’t already know. The mystery code that we are all trying to crack, however, is how we go about doing that.  I am pleased to say that recent experiences at the University of British Columbia have given me cause for optimism. I don’t mean to stand here before you and cry Eureka – I believe there is far more work ahead than behind – but I am optimistic that many of us are on the right track toward achieving richer levels of  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 3 of 11  engagement and collaboration with, and among, our research partners. I would like to share what I hope are some encouraging examples.  Like many of our Canadian sister institutions, UBC has experienced steady yearover-year growth in research funding for some time now. In the most recent fiscal year, our total research funding was roughly 550 million dollars, which represented an increase of approximately 11 per cent from the previous year. What company wouldn’t be happy with an 11 per cent annual revenue increase? The bad news for Canada is that the primary source of this growth continues to be our federal and provincial governments, which provided a full two-thirds of the total amount. Support from non-profit sources (mostly medical charities) accounted for just under 110 million – an encouraging figure – but it is Industry that stands out as the reluctant villager, accounting for just 47 million dollars, or less than nine per cent. And UBC is far ahead of most other Canadian universities on this measure.  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 4 of 11  The years from 1996 to 2003 were the golden years in some ways, with our government steering increasingly more resources to our three federal research granting agencies, and creating new programs to fund both talent and infrastructure.  Thanks in some part to the influence of my predecessor, Dr. Martha Piper, the Canada Research Chairs program was founded in 2000, a program of professorships and chairs to attract and retain some of the most accomplished and promising minds. Like all successful institutions, UBC operated on the belief that talented people are by far the most important asset, and would provide a solid foundation upon which subsequent success could be built. Of the total 1,800 Canada Research Chair holders across Canada, UBC is presently home to 185, just over 10 per cent.  In order to support our country’s growing talent base, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation was established, a complimentary program to the Canada Research  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 5 of 11  Chairs, which leveraged considerable matching support for equipment and infrastructure from provincial governments, and from the private sector.  As UBC’s human foundation began to reach critical mass, its sails caught further wind by the establishment of specialized on-campus services to assist in the development of top-quality proposals and provide administrative and strategic support for UBC researchers pursuing major awards. The combined efforts have yielded some promising results, with UBC consistently attracting 8-9 per cent of Canada’s total government research funding. To put this figure into context, there are 95 universities in Canada, including 15 major medical-doctoral institutions.  If this sounds boastful, it isn’t intended to be. These strategies were envisioned long before my arrival in 2006, and other Canadian universities have posted strong results. The point is that after a long period of growth, both organically and by acquisition, UBC is today equipped with an enviable number of accomplished faculty and students, who are in turn attracting increasingly larger research  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 6 of 11  awards, as well as like-minded colleagues and graduate students from other countries.  Case in point – almost exactly a year ago today, UBC and its affiliated research institutes welcomed Dr. Matthew Farrer as its first Canada Excellence Research Chair in Neurogenetics and Translational Neuroscience. The Canada Excellence Research Chair program is our federal government’s newest program, one that was established in 2008 to help build a critical mass of expertise in strategic areas. For each chair, universities receive up to $10 million over seven years to support chair holders and their teams. Professor Farrer - of English origin - joined the UBC Faculty of Medicine from the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida and is now establishing research teams and laboratories to study the molecular origins of brain diseases and pioneer new strategies for early detection.  What we can conclude from all of this is that our federal government clearly sees the value of research. Our provincial government gets it too. And as we have seen with increasing frequency, high-wealth individuals and foundations are joining the  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 7 of 11  party, many of whom are seeking to fulfill legacy ambitions to leave the world a little better off at the time they leave it than when they entered it.  Industry, as the figures suggest, still doesn’t get it. Ironically though, it is within this sector that we now see signs of light.  Significant changes in the global innovation landscape have prompted our Industry Liaison Office, already a Canadian pioneer, to adapt its practices in response to emerging sectors and changes to open innovation and knowledge sharing.  Gone are the days of chasing the next big thing in the isolation of our labs and libraries. In all too many cases the companies we created were short-lived, the synergies – if they existed – were fleeting, and longer-term interests were left unfulfilled.  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 8 of 11  We are therefore transitioning from churning out patents and license agreements to more flexible modes of industry engagement and knowledge mobilization, matched with full-on promotion of entrepreneurial pursuits amongst our students and faculty. We are matching our strengths with the needs of not just industry, but also government, public administrators and non-profits – and not at the middle or end points of the innovation continuum, but at the beginning, offering our partners a living laboratory in which, together, we are developing technologies for global markets and public service.  I have three examples. First, Dolby Laboratories, a global innovator and provider of audio, imaging, and voice technologies recently acquired UBC spin-off Brightside Technologies, thereby entering its first major engagement with a university. The result is the creation of the Dolby Canada Research and Development Centre in Vancouver, a Dolby Computer Science Research Chair at UBC and a Dolby Professorship in Digital Media.  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 9 of 11  Vancouver-based firm Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies, a UBC spin-off founded in 2005 by UBC Professor Don Mavinic, has commercialized a slow release fertilizer which is in high demand worldwide and is used to improve nutrient loads in rivers with depleted fish stocks. Incidentally, Professor Mavinic is not a biologist, but a civil engineer who initially set out to resolve the problem of phosphorous based composites clogging up municipal sewer systems. His solution enables water treatment plants to run more efficiently, not by flushing harmful sewage phosphorus into the ocean, but by harvesting it and processing it into a fertilizer that is proving to be the best method yet for turning endangered streams into “live zones” that help replenish our threatened salmon populations.  Here is a superb example of university researchers collaborating with governments to address a practical challenge on the one hand; a key environmental issue on the other; create a viable global enterprise on yet another, and introduce new research opportunities for UBC students all at the same time.  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 10 of 11  One final example that exemplifies what we hope is an emerging trend: when our provincial government implemented ambitious sustainability targets in 2008, a new impetus was created for government, academia and industry to work together to increase sustainability understanding, and to boost the province’s emerging clean-tech industry. One result is UBC’s BioEnergy Research and Demonstration Project - a biomass gasification system fuelled by naturally occurring waste wood that will generate over 10 percent of the total heat and electricity needs of the campus. The project is a collaboration between UBC; our federal and provincial governments; Vancouver based Nexterra Systems Corporation, and GE Water & Power. This partnership has resulted in an accelerated product development platform for Nexterra, while also creating a living laboratory for clean energy learning and research for UBC.   Our university has indeed been fortunate in benefiting from the far-sightedness of our governments, which has enabled us to build the critical mass of human assets that are the cornerstone of our success. But while governments continue to provide support, we must endeavour to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in all sectors of the economy, not just within industry circles,  Universitas 21 Global Ideas Roundtable May 19, 2011 Page 11 of 11  but also social agencies, non-profit enterprises, public administration, health-care institutions and other universities.  We must continue efforts to convince public and private organizations to see themselves as collaborators – members of an engaged and caring community intent on leveraging capabilities and capital from all sources.  The moral of the story is that Innovation – like children – symbolizes our shared aspirations for tomorrow. Let us take what we have learned, and raise them both to be secure and healthy.  Thank you.  
1.0107485~Annual general meeting, 2006~Toope, Stephen J.~Annual General Meeting Nov. 1, 2006, 12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. UBC Robson Square  Prof. Stephen J. Toope President & Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  UBC AGM November 1, 2006; Page 1  Thank you and good afternoon. I am supposed to be here today to welcome you to UBC’s Annual General Meeting and, I suppose, to offer a leading voice in celebration of a very good year at UBC. One of the things that drew me to UBC was the fact that there is a strategic plan – we call it Trek 2010 – solidly in place. Its vision is strong, it is clear and it is . . . this: The University of British Columbia, aspiring to be one of the world’s best universities, will prepare students to become exceptional global citizens, promote the values of a civil and sustainable society, and conduct outstanding research to serve the people of British Columbia, Canada, and the world.  But I feel much more like celebrating my own good fortune in joining such a remarkable university with a remarkable vision at such a remarkable time.  Even as a newcomer, I can tell that UBC has been an outstanding institution for a good long time. From the people who recruited me to the community leaders who have welcomed me to Vancouver, I am constantly running into incredibly accomplished alumni. The depth and breadth of UBC’s influence – its very positive influence – is obvious at every turn.  UBC’s reputation is also widely known. There are only two research universities in Canada that are consistently ranked in the top 40 in the world – and when you hail from what might have been the third university on that short list, you can’t help but notice your competitor’s accomplishment.  UBC AGM November 1, 2006; Page 2  But UBC’s reputation couldn’t prepare me for the reality. Very little could prepare someone for the grandeur of UBC Vancouver’s 400-hectare campus – a coastal treasure that the Musqueam nation has prized for thousands of years. It is our great honour to share that land today.  UBC, already one of the world’s best universities, is clearly bursting with promise and possibility. Which is befitting an institution that exists, first and foremost, to nurture a new generation of scholars, researchers and citizens of the world. Every university’s most important role, and my highest priority, is to support teaching and learning – to celebrate the sharing of knowledge and to fully engage tens of thousands of brilliant new students in the task of expanding that knowledge yet further.  That being the case, I’m also delighted to be entirely upstaged today by Dr. Carl Wieman. UBC announced a couple of quite high profile recruits this year: the announcement of a new president was a scheduled necessity and I am deeply honoured to have been offered that opportunity; but welcoming a new Nobel laureate - dedicated to working with committed colleagues to further raise the quality of undergraduate science teaching at UBC and in the post-secondary environment at large – now that was a coup!  UBC AGM November 1, 2006; Page 3  We are grateful to welcome Dr. Wieman to UBC generally and as a speaker today. Welcome, Carl.  Before we do, however, I want to say a brief word about our theme, “Without Borders.”  In preparing for this meeting, I was toying with saying something metaphorical about the importance of transcending borders. I was thinking about saying that I don’t believe in borders – in walls or fences or in any of the figurative limits that constrain the full potential of human endeavour and accomplishment. Universities, after all, are places that should know no limits to creativity and exploration.  But as I thought about it, I realized that I have spent my whole working life building and refining a particular set of borders. I am not just a student of the law; I’m a passionate believer. I believe in the power of law to bring order and hope where there is none, to assure rights when they otherwise might be abrogated. I believe that, in the best cases, socially grounded law that can generate the loyalty of citizens has the capacity to deliver equity and justice, locally, nationally and across the whole world. Law creates frameworks that actually establish a useful range of borders – strategic limits on the behavior of individuals and enabling structures that shape social action, borders that are designed to expand the potential of the whole group.  UBC AGM November 1, 2006; Page 4  Our challenge, then, is not to destroy borders, but to respect them. Our challenge is not to fear or shrink from the limits and boundaries we now face, but to set them, to understand them, sometimes to redefine them – and to rise above them whenever the opportunity exists to benefit the individuals and groups that those borders were designed to protect.  UBC has enjoyed incredible success transcending its borders. We are reaching more successfully than ever into our immediate community with the University Town planning processes. We have reached into the greater Vancouver community with this facility at Robson Square, and with the remarkable UBC Learning Exchange.  We have, through an unfailing partnership with the provincial government, extended a hand into the interior with UBC Okanagan. With the support of governments, corporations, foundations, and individuals, our research teams reach across the country and beyond. And we have also transcended national borders with alliances with some of the greatest universities on the Pacific Rim.  So, thank you for joining us today, for supporting UBC. And thank you for working with us to create a world where a just set of laws and limits are so widely accepted and valued that we might truly operate without borders.  Thank you.  
1.0107478~President’s remarks : MITACS 10-year anniversary~Toope, Stephen J.~President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 1 of 7  Thank you Arvind (Gupta).  Good afternoon, it is indeed a pleasure to be here on behalf of my colleagues across Canada, to take part in celebrating the achievements of MITACS through its inaugural decade.  And to illustrate just what kind of a decade it has been, let’s do some simple math. (I’ll admit, that’s the kind I’m best at!)  Ten years ago when MITACS was first founded, it was the smallest of the Networks of Centres of Excellence. Today, it is the largest, with 526 partner organizations, 1,114 students and 633 faculty members from 55 universities across Canada.  And when the MITACS Internship Program was launched in 2003, there were just 18 internships funded. Last year, there were 608 and that number is expected to double next year.  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 2 of 7  You don’t have to be a mathematician to know that these are impressive metrics. There is, however, another aspect of this growth story that can’t be expressed numerically, but is equally worthy of acknowledgement.  When MITACS was first envisioned back in 1998, its first hurdle – and arguably its greatest challenge– was to invoke an entirely new way of thinking about mathematical research. Up until that time, few of us had noticed that the discipline had evolved far beyond its traditional parameters of basic research.  I confess that I myself did not appreciate until recently the full extent to which mathematical methodologies could be brought to bear on such a vast spectrum of applied research.  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 3 of 7  What this means is that the growth figures I just mentioned point not only to MITACS’ success in bringing universities and partner organizations together, but also to its success in affecting a shift in attitudes towards mathematical research on the part of industry and government, and even among graduate students and their professors.  As a result, the power and influence of mathematics upon the Canadian economy, and upon society as a whole, is much more widely understood. We now understand, for example, how it can unlock secrets behind diseases like Alzheimer’s and diabetes; how it can help to develop new tools to understand climate change; to enhance internet privacy; to establish the long-term viabilities of our resource industries, or to manage retirement incomes.  And as Arvind opportunistically pointed out in another of his tireless efforts to champion the cause, mathematics can even help  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 4 of 7  our Canadian Olympic athletes by pinpointing the optimum rigidity of hockey sticks, or by helping to design the fastest bobsleds.  In saluting this inaugural decade, it should be noted that MITACS has also created a number of programs to facilitate further collaboration between universities, industry and government; to provide professional skill and entrepreneurial development, as well as to inspire the next generation of young Canadian scientists.  If you think about it, the continuum of service that MITACS provides today extends from elementary school classrooms to the boardrooms of the nation, and I have to say that is truly remarkable—and more than worthy of this celebration.  As for Canadian universities, the point that must be emphasized is this: By fostering a wider understanding of the power and multi-  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 5 of 7  disciplinarity of mathematical science, there is today an even greater appetite for university-based research than there was a decade ago. Naturally, what followed has been a steadily increasing investment in university research from both industry and from governments.  Although we have not made as much progress in this regard as the leading US universities, the success of MITACS gives us reason for optimism. It has demonstrated clear and mutually beneficial ways to leverage investments that ultimately serve the social and economic interests of Canada by helping us to attract and retain greater numbers of outstanding graduate students and faculty.  With that in mind, I want to sincerely congratulate Arvind for his scientific and administrative leadership for the last nine years, and to his colleagues from Simon Fraser University for their pioneering work in establishing such a strong foundation for MITACS.  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 6 of 7  And I am particularly proud to acknowledge one of our own faculty members, Professor Nassif Ghoussoub, who was one of the four co-founders of MITACS, and who continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors.  I also wish to acknowledge the vision, support and partnership of our federal government and of various provincial governments across Canada, including our own BC government, which has propelled so much growth in the organization, particularly through the support of the Accelerate Internship Program. (MLA Douglas Horn will be present)  Finally, I wish to salute the 55 universities from across Canada and the 526 organizations who joined forces with us to realize the vision first expressed to a largely unaware nation just over a decade ago.  President’s Remarks MITACS 10-Year Anniversary November 6, 2009 Page 7 of 7  A vital paradigm shift has been achieved, and from every perspective – most importantly, that of the people of Canada – MITACS is a great Canadian success story.  Warmest congratulations to you all.  
1.0102602~Torture : can international law prevent it? : a lecture at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University~Toope, Stephen J.~Torture: Can International Law Prevent it? A Lecture at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University i Stephen J. Toope 8 May 2012 Thank you for the invitation to give this Canada Seminar. My topic is not specifically Canadian, though Canada has been involved in debates around torture, in my view not always to the credit of our government, and not to the improvement of international law. More on that later. Introduction  Does international law matter? Does it influence the behavior of states and, if so, how? Why do states comply with international law, or why not? These are among the questions that international relations scholars and, more recently, international lawyers have been asking about the role of international law in international society. What has been generally absent from these inquiries is sustained engagement with a prior question: what distinguishes legal norms from other social norms?  In Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account Jutta Brunnée (of the University of Toronto) and I argue that law’s distinctiveness rests in the concept and operation in practice of legal obligation. The prevailing accounts of international law pay remarkably little attention to the role of legal obligation, and how it is generated. Many international lawyers view obligation simply as the legal consequence of formal validity or state consent, or take its existence in international practice as given.  Some have gone so far as to suggest that the concept of  international legal obligation is theoretically uninteresting and practically irrelevant. I strongly disagree.  In this lecture, I will briefly set out the parameters of what Brunnée and I call an “interactional approach to international law.”  Then, I will use that  framework to answer the teasing question that I posed in the lecture title: “Torture: Can International Law Prevent It?” The lecture is drawn from the much more detailed analysis contained in our book, recently published by Cambridge University Press.  First, then, a sketching out of the conceptual framework that Brunnée and I propose.  Our framework brings together the legal theory of the mid-twentieth century US scholar, Lon Fuller, and more recent constructivist approaches to International Relations (which I will sometimes refer to as IR) to provide a richer understanding of legal obligation. Constructivism helps us illuminate how shared social norms emerge and shape social interaction. We then rely on a set of criteria of legality identified by Fuller to argue that legal norms exert a distinctive influence. I will enumerate those criteria shortly.  But  Brunnée and I emphasize that law’s influence does not arise simply when social norms meet these criteria of legality. We show that the obligatory effect of international law must be generated and maintained through practices that sustain legality over time.  In short, the three inter-related  elements of our framework – shared understandings, criteria of legality and a practice of legality – are crucial to generating distinctive legal legitimacy and  2  a sense of commitment among those to whom law is addressed. They create legal obligation.  A strong claim concerning legal legitimacy is implicit in our framework: only when law is made through the interactional approach we describe can it be said that the law is ‘legitimate.’ This distinctive legal legitimacy does not merely produce adherence to specific rules, but generates fidelity to the rule of law itself. Our account highlights that influential norms will not emerge in the absence of processes that allow for the active participation of relevant social actors. Social actors in the global domain include states, of course, but the interactional framework acknowledges the importance of robust participation by intergovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, other collective entities, and individuals. The need for broad participation in the creation and upholding of law (through the evolution of shared understandings, and in the building up of communities of practice) has two further  consequences  worth  noting.  The  interactional  framework  acknowledges and reinforces the diversity of international society, and shows that legal power is more distributed than commonly thought.  Let me now further explain the three components of the interactional approach to international law.  Shared Understandings  Social norms can only emerge when they are rooted in an underlying set of shared understandings supporting first the need for normativity, and then particular norms that shape behavior. Actors generate and promote certain 3  understandings, whether through norm entrepreneurship or through the work of epistemic communities, groups of people who learn things together and promote norms based on what they have learned (e.g. climate scientists or international lawyers themselves).  Shared understandings may emerge,  evolve or fade through processes of social interaction and social learning. Once in existence, shared understandings become background knowledge or norms that shape how actors perceive themselves and the world, how they form interests and set priorities, and how they make or evaluate arguments. The Criteria of Legality  Legal norms too are rooted in shared social understandings. However, shared understandings alone do not make law. Many social norms exist that never reach the threshold of legal normativity, like saying ‘excuse me’ when you cut in front of someone, or wearing a dinner jacket to a formal dinner in Hall. What distinguishes legal norms from other types of social norms is not form or pedigree, but adherence to specific criteria of legality. Lon Fuller set out eight such criteria, which apply to both individual rules and systems of rulemaking. Legal norms must be general, prohibiting, requiring or permitting certain conduct. They must also be promulgated, and therefore accessible to the public, enabling actors to know what the law requires. Law should not be retroactive, but prospective, enabling citizens to take the law into account in their decision-making.  Actors must also be able to understand what is  permitted, prohibited or required by law – the law must be relatively clear. Law should avoid contradiction, not requiring or permitting and prohibiting at the same time. Law must be realistic and not demand the impossible. Its requirements of citizens must remain relatively constant.  4  Finally, there  should be congruence between legal norms and the actions of officials operating under the law.  Fuller stressed that law is not a unidirectional projection of power.  He  emphasized the need for reciprocity between officials and citizens in the creation and maintenance of all law. Reciprocity, in Fuller’s conception, means that law-givers must be able to expect that citizens will “accept as law and generally observe” the promulgated body of rules. Conversely, citizens must be able to expect that the government will abide by and apply these rules, and that official actions will be congruent with posited law and consonant with the requirements of legality.  Reciprocity is deeper than the exchange flowing from the calculation of material interests. When the eight criteria of legality are met, actors will be able to reason with rules because they will share meaningful standards. When rules guide decision-making in this fashion, law will tend to attract its own adherence – or ‘fidelity.’ Fidelity to law, or in our terminology ‘obligation,’ is generated because adherence to the criteria of legality in the creation and application of norms produce law that is legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it is addressed.  The Practice of Legality  In international society, the deeper sense of reciprocity that I just described is even more salient because states are both subjects and lawmakers.  The  horizontal and reciprocal nature of interactions guided by legality is also  5  central to law’s distinctive legitimacy. In short, interactional obligation must be practiced to maintain its influence.  The idea of communities of practice, therefore, rounds out our approach to the relationship between law and shared understandings. The key point is that interactional law does not arise simply because a community of practice has grown around a given issue or norm. Only when this community is engaged in a practice of legality can shared legal understandings, be they procedural or substantive, modest or ambitious, be produced, maintained or altered. We suggest that there exist multiple, overlapping communities of legal practice.  Another important point is underscored by focusing on the role of communities of practice:  it is not enough to cast socially shared  understandings in legal form; they cannot simply be ‘posited.’ Positive law can be an element of interactional law, often an important element, but it is not necessarily coextensive with it. The communities of practice concept instructs that positive law is a method of ‘fixing’ legal understandings – a function that is particularly important in large, diffuse societies. It may also assist in meeting requirements of legality, such as promulgation, clarity, transparency, or predictability. But without sufficiently dense interactions between participants in the legal system, positive law will remain, or become, dead letter.  The interactional account also highlights, then, that the mere declaration of common values in formal law can be deceptive. Without a community of practice, supposed shared values will remain lofty rhetoric.  Yet, for a  community of practice around international legal norms to emerge, it is not 6  necessary to imagine the existence of a homogenous ‘international community’ sharing a common goal or vision. It is not necessary to have a morally cohesive ‘community’ before lawmaking is possible. Fuller’s work shows us that a community of legal practice can exist with a thin set of substantive value commitments; indeed, this is the reality of international law today.  Now I will show how this framework helps to make sense of the evolution and current status of the anti-torture norm in international law.  Torture  In the United Nations Convention Against Torture, torture is described as:  …any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for [specific] purposes… when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity....  The United Nations Committee Against Torture has stated that the prohibition against torture in international law is absolute; that it is a norm of customary international law that must be met at all times.  However powerful the anti-torture norm may have been historically, there can be no doubt that it was severely challenged in the years following the attacks of September 11th, 2001.  Certainly within the United States, a wide 7  consensus seemed to emerge that torture might be justifiable, even necessary, in circumstances where deep threats to national security – like global terrorism – were present.  In political discourse and on the radio and  television talk shows, “ticking time bomb” scenarios were invoked routinely as examples of when torture might be justified, or at least excused. Popular culture seemed even to glorify acts of patriotic security agents who would torture when necessary to protect their country from harm.  The most  prominent example of that cultural trend was the hit television thriller “24.”  Although 24 was planned before the assaults of 11 September, it soon became identified with a frightening new era of global terrorist threats against the United States. Jack Bauer, the hero, routinely employed forms of torture himself, and the message was clear: the ends justify the means.  The question that arises, from the standpoint of interactional international law, is whether or not 24 was indicative of changing shared understandings within and outside the United States in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 that might have undermined any previously existing international norms against torture.  To answer that question, it is first necessary briefly to trace the history of the rule prohibiting torture and to assess whether or not the rule was firmly grounded in widely shared understandings before Osama bin Laden’s shocking assault on the United States of America. I will then assess the evolution of the shared understandings underpinning the anti-torture norm from 11 September 2001 to date.  8  Shared Understandings and the Anti-torture Norm Before 11 September 2001  The imposition of severe physical pain to extract information or to punish or degrade human beings has been practiced throughout human history by sadistic criminals, warriors, religious officials, and the state.  But for our purposes, “torture” is not the application of physical force by anyone; it emerged as a legal process linked closely to judicial procedure. Although the famous English jurist Blackstone famously resisted the description of torture as “legal” – he viewed it as an abhorrent continental tradition outside the law – recent scholarship shows that torture emerged in most of the West as an adjunct to processes of public law.  In his magisterial Torture and the Law of Proof, John Langbein traced the legal history of torture in England and continental Europe, and its connection to the laws of proof. In a recent reflection on that history in the light of events after 11 September 2001, Langbein reminds us: “For half a millennium the law courts of continental Europe tortured suspected people to obtain evidence. They acted openly and according to law”. He explains how the criminal procedure became dependent on torture. Langbein suggests that the refusal of English common law to adopt torture was not, pace Blackstone, primarily the result of moral superiority, but because the English laws of proof were so primitive that torture would not have been useful  As early as the Renaissance, however, resistance to the use of torture was building, on grounds of legal logic and moral opprobrium. European states 9  formally abolished the legal use of torture over the course of two centuries during the Enlightenment. Given the domination of Enlightenment discourse over 19th century legal and social historiography, the story of the formal abolition of torture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries across Europe has often been read together with the end of slavery as a triumph of “progressive” sensibility, as part of a narrative of moral perfectibility.  Contemporary  scholars debunk this notion, emphasizing that the “end” of torture was never actually accomplished in state policy, or even in law. As soon as treason was suspected, forms of law permitted torture.  With the growth of state power in the later 19th and 20th centuries, in many countries such legal limitations on torture as existed were increasingly ignored. So the ‘abolition’ of torture even in Europe was but a fleeting achievement, overrun by the emergence of totalitarian regimes in the USSR, Spain, Italy, and Germany. In the late 1950s, revelations of the routine use of torture by the French in Algeria demonstrated that even democratic regimes could succumb to the temptations of torture in the name of national security.  In the 20th century, further revelations of torture committed by colonial powers emerged in Africa and Asia. With the growth of independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International, documentation of torture became more systematic, implicating scores of regimes.  Ironically, perhaps, in exact parallel to these chastening practices was the increasingly forceful rhetorical condemnation of the use of torture in all circumstances  by  the  United  intergovernmental organizations.  Nations  system  and  by  regional  With the entry into force of the Rome 10  Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2002, torture was even categorized as an international crime.  Throughout Western societies, national legal systems, often relying on the formal international legal condemnations of torture, have issued ringing statements upholding the absolute prohibition on the use of torture. One of the best examples is the reasons of the Law Lords in the famous 1999 case concerning General Pinochet.  Although it is difficult to assimilate all this contradictory information, we must assess in a dispassionate way whether or not there existed, prior to the events of 11 September 2001, a widely shared understanding that torture is a completely unacceptable practice in all circumstances.  I am forced to a  troubling conclusion that by the end of the 20th century, the norm against torture was strong as an aspiration but was only weakly supported by a shared understanding around the globe. When Al Qaeda succeeded in its attacks on the United States, the shared understanding supporting the prohibition on torture was fragile at best.  Shared Understandings and the Anti-torture Norm After 11 September 2001  Not surprisingly, in the months immediately following the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, in a context of heightened fear and deep frustration, the question of the use of torture came to the forefront. It was in this period that the television programme, 24, with its routine subjugation of terrorist suspects to torture, burst onto the scene. Opinion leaders in the 11  United States also embraced the show during the years of the Bush Administration.  In a moment of high drama during an otherwise staid panel discussion involving Canadian and American judges, US Supreme Court Justice Scalia chastised a Canadian Federal Court judge who had offered the comment: “Thankfully, security agencies in all our countries do not subscribe to the mantra ‘What would Jack Bauer do?’” Justice Scalia pushed back: “Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles.... He saved hundreds of thousands of lives… You have the right to a jury trial? Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer? I don't think so. So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes. And ought we believe in these absolutes?”  Bauer’s fictional methods may even have had a more direct effect upon US interrogation practices in the years after 11 September 2001. In a remarkable admission, the junior Army legal officer who wrote the original opinion justifying the use of 18 “aggressive” interrogation methods at Guantánamo Bay told an interviewer that the hero of 24 “gave people lots of ideas” – she was referring to soldiers who conducted the Guantánamo interrogations. Apparently, many soldiers watched 24 while stationed at Guantánamo: “it was hugely popular,” she suggested.  The increasingly routine infiltration of torture into the popular imagination was not limited to the USA. The television show 24 was shown widely and became popular in scores of countries around the world.  The recent James  Bond thrillers Casino Royale and Die Another Day, which attracted large audiences globally, also portray grim scenes of torture that are far more 12  explicit than anything shown earlier in the franchise, as did the most recent installment of the Batman series, The Dark Knight.  Aside from the evolution of popular culture, there are other more formal indications that the shared understanding supporting an absolute prohibition on torture was weakening in the years immediately following 11 September 2001. In his 2005 Report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism pointed to “increased questioning or compromising of the absolute prohibition on torture and all forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” as a global phenomenon. In human rights reports dating from the early to late-2000s, independent sources detailed a worrying list of states from around the globe that committed torture: Albania, Burundi, China, Egypt, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Zimbabwe are but some examples. Governments of these states often invoked “terrorism” as the scourge that they were trying to suppress.  At the level of official action in the world’s remaining superpower, conscious and forceful attempts were made by the Bush Administration to re-interpret the very idea of torture so as to render “aggressive interrogations” by US and allied intelligence agencies lawful. In our book, Brunnée and I detail the evolution of US policy and practice from 2001 to 2006. I can only offer a few excerpts here.  As early as 14 September 2001 Vice-President Cheney vowed to use “any means at our disposal” to fight what was already being described as the “War on Terror”. Just two days later, Cheney declared on national television that 13  the US government would have to work through “the dark side” to fight against potential terrorist attacks.  In February 2002, arguing that the United States needed “new thinking in the law of war,” President Bush issued an Executive Order denying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners the protections of the Geneva Conventions.  A few  months later, Attorney-General Ashcroft determined that “waterboarding” (pouring water over a constrained prisoner’s cloth-covered face to induce fear of suffocation) is legal, permitting its use during interrogations of top Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubayda.  This prisoner was ultimately subjected to  waterboarding more than 80 times.  On 1 August 2002, a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel, signed by Bybee, but written primarily by John Yoo, was sent to the White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales.  Yoo sought to limit the concept of torture  dramatically, interpreting the US statute so that only pain “associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions” constituted physical torture.  In October 2002, the commander of the Guantánamo detention site requested authorization of new interrogation techniques, supported by a legal memorandum authored by an inexperienced Staff Judge Advocate, Diane Beaver, who had tried futilely to have her legal opinion checked and corrected by superiors.  Shortly thereafter, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  authorized aggressive interrogation techniques for prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, relying on the legal opinion authored by Beaver. In March 2003 U.S. and Pakistani forces captured the main planner of the 11 September attacks, 14  Kalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times during that month.  In 2003 and 2004, information began to emerge about the treatment of Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees by the US government. The Red Cross issued a rare public statement in October 2003 detailing the deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of detainees at Guantánamo Bay. That same month, photographic evidence was circulated widely over the internet suggesting serious abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The existence of the “torture memos” was revealed in June 2004 by the Washington Post, and the new head of the OLC, Jack Goldsmith, withdrew the August 2002 memo and subsequently resigned.  In February 2005 Alberto Gonzales became the eightieth Attorney General of the United States, and in May the Office of the Legal Counsel sent a new and more comprehensive secret memo to the CIA Counsel, arguing once again that the techniques of coercive interrogation used by the CIA, including waterboarding, were lawful. This OLC opinion remained effective throughout the last years of the Bush Administration.  US polling results show that the Bush Administration had, for a time, considerable success first in shielding “harsh” interrogation techniques from public view, and second in convincing many members of the American public that the ill-defined “harsh” techniques were consonant with existing international and domestic law. As The Economist magazine pointed out, “[t]he 11 September attacks have not driven any rich democracy to reverse  15  itself and make torture legal. But they have encouraged the bending of definitions and the turning of blind eyes.”  In around 2005 the tide began to turn; public opinion shifted quickly after the revelations of secret detention sites and the abuses at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Declining support for the use of torture against suspected terrorists was manifested in responses to popular media as the decade progressed. Whereas 24 had ridden a wave of support for harsh anti-terrorist actions over its first five years on-air, the mood shifted markedly in 2006-2007: Ratings dropped by a third over the course of last year's sixth season. In a remarkable twist, the Dean of the United States Military Academy at West Point participated in a 2006 meeting with the writers of 24. The Dean argued that the show was promoting “unethical and illegal behavior and had adversely affected the training and performance of real American soldiers.”  Meanwhile, in a number of Western democracies, including the United States, courts were issuing judgments by 2004 that had begun to limit the powers asserted by officials in the prosecution of the War on Terror. The United States Supreme Court extended the right of habeas corpus to foreign nationals held at Guantánamo Bay.  Although the US Supreme Court has not yet had the opportunity to consider directly the legality of torture within the context of anti-terrorist policies, the UK House of Lords has done so in robust fashion. In a case concerning the admissibility of evidence obtained through suspected torture outside the UK, Lord Hope’s speech was especially forceful: “[t]he use of such evidence is excluded not on the grounds of its unreliability... but on grounds of its 16  barbarism, its illegality, and its inhumanity. The law will not lend its support to the use of torture for any purpose whatever. It has no place in the defence of freedom and democracy, whose very existence depends on the denial of the use of such methods to the executive.”  It seems that as more time passed after 11 September 2001, Americans became increasingly shaken by the “aggressive” interrogation amounting to torture undertaken in their name. One of the very first acts of President Obama was to issue a series of Executive orders distancing the US government from the practices adopted by the Bush Administration in the War on Terror. He specifically repudiated the Yoo-Bybee torture memos.  My story reveals that for the first few years after 11 September 2001, there appears to have been a further eroding of the already weak shared understanding precluding torture. The US Government became an active “norm entrepreneur” in seeking to alter two distinct aspects of the international prohibition on torture: first, that torture was outlawed in all circumstances; and second, that torture could be defined to allow waterboarding and other techniques that did not produce pain equivalent to the spasms of death or “organ failure”.  This norm entrepreneurship  ultimately failed to generate shared understandings to support normative change.  Popular opinion worldwide, and especially in the US, moved away from relatively broad support for the necessity of torture in combating global terrorism. Indeed, it seems that the Bush Administration, in arguing for an untrammelled right of the President to do “whatever it takes” to fight 17  terrorists, including the de facto authorization of torture, had overreached and created strong pushback across the world, and within America itself. Perhaps ironically, instead of further undermining the weak shared understanding supporting the prohibition on torture that existed in 2001, events over the years after 2005 have ultimately reinforced that shared understanding, potentially making the anti-torture rule stronger.  The next step in our interactional framework is to ask whether or not the absolute prohibition on torture meets the eight criteria of legality.  The Prohibition on Torture and the Criteria of Legality  The absolute prohibition on torture as exemplified by the United Nations Convention against Torture clearly meets six of Fuller’s internal requirements of legality. In the book, Brunnée make that argument in detail. Today, I will focus only on the two criteria that present considerable difficulty.  One of Fuller’s eight criteria of legality requires that law be relatively clear; capable of comprehension. Clarity of the rule against torture is a complicated issue. At first blush, the rule is exquisitely clear because it is said to be a blanket prohibition without exception under any circumstances. If that were true, all relevant actors would be able to understand what is permitted, prohibited or required by the law. The difficulty is that there is no commonly accepted definition of what constitutes “severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.” The Torture Convention does not further define these terms; it draws a distinction between torture and other “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. 18  Implicit in this distinction is the  assumption that there are forms of abusive treatment that do not amount to torture.  The Geneva Conventions ban torture and other forms of  mistreatment, but contain no definition of the term.  In attempting to systematically narrow the definition of torture in 2002, a group of US Administration lawyers met with the military leadership at Guantánamo Bay. In minutes of the meeting released to a US Senate hearing, a CIA lawyer is quoted as suggesting that the definition of torture “is basically subject to perception.” He added: “If the detainee dies, you’re doing it wrong.”  In this context of competing and uncertain definitions, the OLC torture memos found at least temporary traction. Yoo later suggested that he never doubted that there was a ban on torture, only that the term needed more precise definition. “But,” he asks, “would limiting a captured terrorist to six hours’ sleep, isolating him, interrogating him for several hours, or requiring him to exercise constitute” suffering amounting to torture? Phrased in this rather anodyne manner, the answer might be “no”. But what if one were closer to the actual practices used on some “high value” detainees at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere? What if the isolation went on for months, even years; if the deprivation of sleep were repeated for days on end? What if the interrogations included threats of anal rape, slaps, the forced viewing of pornography, and subjection to extremely loud music for hours at a time? What if, interspersed amongst the questions, was repeated waterboarding?  These questions suggest the reason that the international law prohibition is said to be absolute: allowing the use of “aggressive” techniques of 19  interrogation opens up vistas of abuse that may be hard to resist, as the interrogator becomes frustrated with his own failure to generate actionable information; the temptation to go just that one step further to produce results is enormous. In other words, torture may come to seem both necessary and, by steps, normal.  Assessing the criterion of clarity in the face of this conflicting data is difficult. The precise content of the anti-torture norm is uncertain because of the lack of any widely accepted definition of what constitutes “severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental”. However, it is apparent that since 11 September 2001, the conscious efforts made to narrow the definition of torture have been rejected.  What has emerged is a reaffirmation that it is impossible to create  acceptable gradations of aggressive interrogation that can be sustained in practice over time. I conclude that the existing prohibition on torture, although not without grey definitional edges, is clear enough to satisfy the criteria of clarity.  Fuller’s final criterion of legality, that there be congruence between legal norms and the actions of officials operating under the law, also presents significant problems.  So as to avoid repetition, I will blend consideration of congruence, as a criterion of legality, into an investigation of the last step in determining the legal force of the prohibition on torture, deciding whether or not a practice of legality upholds the norm. If there is no such practice, I will also be able to conclude that the final criterion of legality is not met.  20  Prohibiting Torture and the Practice of Legality  We know that torture has been committed round the world since time immemorial. What concerns us now is the extent to which torture has been committed by state security forces, or with their acquiescence, after 11 September 2001. Sadly, evidence of the practice of torture in states around the globe since 2001 could be expounded for far longer than I have time to undertake here. Suffice it to note that the report of the Arar Commission in Canada, demonstrates that torture is routinely practiced in Syrian detention centres. The Agiza case from Sweden reveals similar patterns of torture in Egypt. Russian security forces have been implicated in torture, especially in the context of suppressing Chechen rebels. Credible reports suggest that the Chinese government has authorized or tolerated the torture of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang province.  Pakistan, until very recently a favoured ally in the War on Terror, is reported by major human rights organizations to practice torture in many locations across the country. Iranian authorities use torture to stifle dissent. For Uzbek security forces, torture is a routine means of extracting confessions to be used in criminal trials. In Myannmar, torture was used to further repression of all dissent. Torture also seems to be a routine practice in North Korea, again as an instrument of control. Torture exists as well in sub-Saharan Africa, with reliable reports of torture practiced by security forces or their agents in Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and The Gambia. Even in Latin America, where enormous political and legal efforts have been made to move away from the abuses of authoritarian regimes in the 1970s and 80s, torture  21  continues to be employed by some security forces, with credible reports emerging from Mexico, Venezuela and Paraguay.  Equally disturbing is evidence of the complicity of Western security forces in torture committed in secret detention sites in various locations around the globe. In a report to the Human Rights Commission in February 2004, the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, which I then chaired, identified a disturbing trend in the War on Terror. The Working Group had begun to receive credible information revealing the existence of secret detention centres in several countries. These centres were said to exist in the developing world, but it appeared that they were created at the behest of the United States of America.  In November 2005, the Washington Post published a powerful piece of investigative journalism revealing that ghost prisons may have existed in eight countries including some EU member states in Eastern Europe and candidate countries for EU membership.  President Bush formally  acknowledged the existence of secret detention sites run by the CIA in 2006. In a televised speech, he revealed that in these secret prisons “an alternative set of procedures” was used to obtain information from terrorist suspects.  Secret detention is ripe for abuse; hiding people makes them especially vulnerable. There is now ample evidence in the public domain that abusive interrogation, amounting to torture, has taken place in these ghost prisons. In August 2009, the CIA released a 2004 report by the CIA Inspector General that was highly critical of techniques used in some interrogations.  22  In considering whether a practice of legality existed after 11 September 2001 to support the absolute prohibition on torture, it would seem that the answer is no: Torture is practiced in all regions of the globe, and it has been sanctioned even by western democracies, including by my own country. Were this conclusion to stand unvarnished, a further implication would be that the last criteria of legality, that official action must mesh with a purported rule of law, would not be met. On two grounds, then, breaching a criterion of legality and failing to find a continuing practice of legality, the absolute prohibition on torture would not qualify as interactional international law.  However, my final assessment must be more nuanced because the practices of torture since 11 September 2001 are increasingly under scrutiny. Even in the darkest days after the September 11 attacks, rays of light were penetrating the cells of secret detention. A number of former FBI and ex-CIA agents, retired military leaders, and some members of the US government and military legal services, spoke out strongly against secret detention and torture.  As early as 2007, senior members of the US Congress had also begun publicly to question the use of secret detention and the attendant likelihood of abuse.  In one of his very first acts, President Obama announced that he would overturn the Bush-era Executive Order authorizing “harsh” interrogation techniques.  The President also ordered the review of secret detention  facilities, looking for lawful options for detention.  Meanwhile, a  Parliamentary inquiry into complicity with torture was launched in the UK but then scrapped in deference to re-launched criminal proceedings. The 23  Justice Secretary has promised that once the criminal process has been exhausted, a judge-led inquiry would be established.  In Canada  compensation has been given to a victim of torture in Syria after a public inquiry into the role of Canadian officials in extraordinary rendition from the US to Syria.  The practice of legality on the prohibition of torture has been in a state of movement since 11 September 2001. Torture was taking place around the globe, and was even being used or connived in by liberal democracies, most notably by the indispensible global actor, the United States. Yet the tide has shifted. Disgust over the use of torture seems to be reasserting itself both amongst Western governments and in the public. However, it cannot be said that the undermining of the prohibition has been completely reversed. It is not yet the case that secret detention has been precluded by Executive Order in the US, nor that all forms of “torture lite” are excluded from the arsenal of US interrogators. It must also be admitted that torture is continuing in many states around the globe, and does not seem to be a particular priority for global action.  Conclusion  The case of torture points to both the robustness of the interactional approach to international law and to the hard-headed approach that the analysis demands. Quite frankly, I am not at all comfortable with the conclusion to which my and Brunnée’s analysis draws us in relation to the prohibition on 24  torture, but I am firmly convinced that the analysis is nonetheless reasonable and accurate.  In evaluating the underlying global shared understandings supporting the absolute prohibition on torture contained in the UN Torture Convention I conclude that the understandings were weak before 11 September 2001. In an intriguing twist, the shared understandings were initially further undermined in the few years immediately following Osama bin Laden’s attacks; however, by 2006, the revulsion that attended disclosures of Western, and especially US, government complicity in torture began to reinforce a shared understanding precluding the use of torture in all circumstances.  Attempts made in the OLC memos and subsequent actions of high-ranking US officials to explicitly narrow the definition of torture did not succeed. They did not generate widely shared understandings; indeed they were actively resisted by senior US military and security officials, US allies, the media, NGOs, and the general public.  It remains sadly true that when one considers the eighth criterion of legality, congruence of official action with a posited norm, there is strong evidence that torture is routinely practiced all around the globe in the name of national security, and sometimes simply to extract confessions in criminal proceedings. The complicity, or direct action, of Western security agencies in “harsh” interrogations amounting to torture also undermined this criterion of legality in the period after 11 September 2001. The same data, credibly reported by NGO and official sources, leads to the further conclusion that we lack a robust practice of legality continuing to support the absolute 25  prohibition on torture.  My provisional conclusion is that the absolute  prohibition on torture does not meet the standards of interactional international law.  I call this a “provisional” conclusion because the situation is fluid, and there is good evidence to suggest that we are living through a period of normative transition as concerns the anti-torture rule. The reassertion of a robust shared understanding that the prohibition on torture is necessary, and that it should be absolute, is building.  What remains uncertain is whether there is a strong  normative impulse to confront and challenge the practices of torture that seem endemic in so many states around the globe.  The rule prohibiting torture is a fascinating example of why I argue so strenuously that the work of international law is not done with the positing of a rule in a “binding” convention.  Rules are constructed, buttressed or  destroyed through the continuing practice of states and other international actors. In the case of human rights norms, like the anti-torture rule, the work of non-state actors, particularly NGOs and the media, is particularly necessary and powerful. So the most important conclusion to draw from an interactional analysis of the prohibition of torture is that the struggle to maintain the norm is never over.  If that work is not undertaken successfully, the formal  existence of an absolute prohibition on torture could still become a dead letter. Can international law prevent torture? Yes, but only if together we keep working at it. i  Based on J. Brunnée and S.J.Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapters 1-3 and 5.

1.0107506~Vancouver energy roundtable~Toope, Stephen J.~Vancouver Energy Roundtable 15 June 2011 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia Thank you, Jonathan, for that warm introduction. And thank you, Jon and Wal for your illuminating overview on the clean tech sector I’m delighted to be able to take part in this roundtable today and to speak a bit about UBC and the Living Laboratory that it is becoming. I know that this subject was part of your discussion during the last roundtable in December, so I hope to build upon what you already know. More than anything I hope that we can engage in a continuing dialogue for the benefit of our respective organizations, our province, our economy, and our world.  Let me begin by proposing that we all share a common purpose and that is simply this: to change the world for the better. That may not be the way you always think of what you do, but I believe it’s true. I believe that we want to make a difference, and that we want that difference to be positive. As businesses, municipalities and academic  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 2 of 15  institutions, we approach this purpose differently and we are rewarded differently for our endeavors; but success, however any of us defines it, necessarily changes the world. And one of the key measures of that change is reflected in our economy. Once upon a time a university president might have been able to make fine statements about changing the world through teaching and research on campus, and that would be enough. Today I know better and I know you better so I will back up my statement with numbers. Of course, universities create and preserve knowledge; we foster talent. But there is more than an intangible social and cultural effect - - as important as that effect still is. Perhaps you have seen some of these figures before. If not, it has not been through lack of effort on my part. The University of British Columbia is a $2-billion-dollar-a-year organization. We receive, annually, a bit more than half a billion dollars in research funds. Economist Walter Sudmant has determined, after rigorous external peer review, that the value to the economy of new knowledge and technology transfer from our university, annually, is $5 billion dollars. As a return on that half billion dollar investment that is a factor of 10.  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 3 of 15  A full order of magnitude. Another $2.6 billion dollars is added to the economy as a result of increased income earned by our alumni. Some of you, I am sure, have benefited directly from new knowledge generated and research conducted at our universities. Many of you also benefit from increased income due to your education. I certainly hope so. All of us profit indirectly. Taking into account direct spending and other factors, UBC accounts for some $10 billion dollars annually. This is UBC alone, not counting our province’s three other research-intensive universities. $10 billion dollars is about 5% of the provincial economy, more than Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction. Yes, UBC and all our research-intensive universities are major players in the BC economy. But we can do more, and that is where the Living Laboratory comes in. The concept of the University as a Living Laboratory adds another level of value to the economy, and in particular to the cleantechnology sector. As you may already know, the University as a  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 4 of 15  Living Laboratory is providing more than knowledge and more than education, more than researchers and more than well-educated graduates. We are offering up, for the first time, our campus itself and our considerable infrastructure as a test bed and demonstration site for your ideas and your technology. The Laboratory in question comprises some 500 buildings on more than 1,000 acres. About 50,000 people live, work and study in it. We are the sole owner-occupiers of what amounts to a small city, with a population between that of Port Coquitlam and West Vancouver. Our “city” owns and operates all our own utilities: water, electrical, heat and waste. Since 1998 this small city has achieved remarkable results in energy efficiency and carbon reduction. We hit our 2012 Kyoto targets five years early in spite of growing our building base by 35 per cent and our enrollment by 48 per cent. Energy savings through programs such as EcoTrek – a retrofitting of electrical and water infrastructure  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 5 of 15  in over 250 buildings – not only provided carbon reductions, but also returned savings, $2.6 million annually for EcoTrek. But all of our sustainability accomplishments on campus were achieved using proven, safe, technologies. Meanwhile, as if in another world, you, and our academic researchers, were advancing newer ideas and innovative solutions. The idea behind the Living Laboratory is to remove the firewall that has traditionally existed between academics and operations— academics being the ones who illuminate our world and operations who are tasked with keeping the lights on. One group has been researching sustainability and the other has been deftly working to be sustainable.  Let’s put these two capabilities together and let us then develop partnerships with businesses such as yours, and cities such as Vancouver. Let us research, test and model sustainable solutions. Let us go even one step further and demonstrate them at sufficient scale to make them easily transferable to the marketplace. This is the Living Laboratory.  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 6 of 15  What’s in it for you? According to the Carbon Governance Project, there is a crying need in the BC clean-tech sector for large-scale demonstration capabilities. Well, we are pleased to tell you that UBC is offering large-scale demonstration capabilities within our research mandate. We have been pleased to work with you in R&D. With the Living Laboratory we enter the R, D &D business. Research, Development and Demonstration. We believe that this will be of great benefit to you, to our university, and to the world as a whole. We think the Living Laboratory will enable you to break through to full acceptance of your solutions in Canada and in export markets. For our part we expect to reap the benefits of energy savings. We will leverage your assistance in meeting our own and the government’s emission targets. We see valuable opportunities for our students and faculty to participate in cutting edge research. And we believe that what we demonstrate with you on our campus will help change the world for the better  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 7 of 15  These then are the basic elements of our Living Laboratory: Partnerships among researcher, students, businesses, organizations and the public sector… …conducted within our core academic mandate… …asking sound financial use of our substantial operational infrastructure… …with the prospect of not only addressing the world’s toughest challenges but of actually changing the world for the better. We say that UBC is a Place of Mind. Until recently our contributions to new knowledge and technology transfer were primarily of the “mind” variety. Now we are also providing our Place. Let me illustrate with one of our flagship Living Laboratory projects. In British Columbia there is a company called Nexterra that is developing systems that convert biomass such as wood waste into a synthetic gas—or syngas as it is commonly referred to. This syngas is used by a General Electric Janbacher engine to produce electricity. It also produces waste heat in the form of steam and hot water.  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 8 of 15  Clearly, this combined heat and power system is ideal for our province, as we live in a heavily forested part of the world. The city of Vancouver has a great deal of urban wood waste that has limited uses and in some cases was going directly to landfills. Coincidentally, UBC has aging heating and electrical infrastructure in need of maintenance and upgrading. Furthermore, a member of our own faculty—Professor John Grace in the department of Applied Science—is a world-leading researcher in the area of bioenergy. Putting all these things and people together—integrating our operations and our research with business partnerships—resulted in a proposal for what we call the Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Project. It will be the first steam heat and electrical generating utility with this technology of its size and scale. And it will be incorporated directly into our existing campus infrastructure to be tried and tested. This demonstration project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an amount comparable to removing 1,100 automobiles from the road while generating enough electricity to power 1,500 homes plus steam  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 9 of 15  heat for some of our buildings. It will get us roughly one third of the way to our 2015 goal of a 33% greenhouse gas reduction from 2007 levels. Because nothing like it had been done at this scale before, it could serve as a model for comparable systems in cities around the world. Funding the project was an interesting and complex endeavor. We could access money from the Clean Energy Fund, Western Diversification, BC’s Innovative Clean Energy Fund, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, the BC Bioenergy Network, and private sector support from FP Innovations and Nexterra itself. This covered about three quarters of the total cost. The rest, and the single largest contribution, came from UBC itself, a capital investment, or mortgage, if you will, based on our operations office determining that we would save between $10 and $15 million dollars in energy costs over the next 15 years. The commercial benefits of the project, including the intellectual property, would stay with the commercial partners. The research benefits would stay with the academic partners, and the energy savings and carbon reductions would contribute to our campus  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 10 of 15  achieving our 2015 commitments of 33% reductions from 2007. Win. Win. Win. As I describe the project in this simple straightforward manner I imagine my colleagues James Tansey and Steve Cockcroft and Jon Rhone smiling to themselves. If you get a chance today, ask them to share with you some of their “war stories” about arriving at this straightforward solution. It was a good thing to do. It was the right thing to do. But it was not always an easy thing to do. In order for the Living Laboratory to come to fruition, very different people and very different organizations had to learn to communicate and work together in completely new ways. In order to succeed, our operations people had to agree to experiment on a system whose efficient, reliable operation they are completely accountable for. Our Board of Governors had to be convinced that the project was a responsible use of taxpayers’, donors’, and students’ money, and that  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 11 of 15  the project fit within the university’s academic mandate. Intellectual property agreements had to be re-thought and rewritten, because IP was in danger of inhibiting innovation, not advancing it. Academics, who are famously independent and cynical, had to be satisfied that their academic integrity and freedom would be preserved. And, finally, time itself had to change. You entrepreneurs move fast. Governments and large organizations, not so much. At UBC, we’re getting up to speed. We’re maybe twice as nimble as we were two years ago. The journey was awkward but interesting. None of the challenges were insurmountable, but I think it is important to note just how hard innovation can be – not because the solutions are difficult, but because humans simply tend to be attached to the way they usually do things. This is an issue that runs through every aspect of sustainability.  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 12 of 15  Forty years ago, the cartoonist Walt Kelly coined a famous phrase at the very dawn of the sustainability movement. He had Pogo say “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Well, forty years on we are fighting the good fight, and I’m happy to say that while changing people and institutions is still hard, we’re learning how to do it. I’m happy to announce that our Living Laboratory is open for business and well under way. We at UBC are currently investing some $150 million dollars in clean technology Living Laboratory projects. In addition to our Bioenergy project with Nexterra and GE, there is the Centre for Interactive Research in Sustainability which will open this fall. There is one of the largest steam to hot water conversions in North America. There is a continuous building optimization program, and we are close to concluding agreements on  a major Smartgrid program. Our partners in our living laboratory include BC Hydro, Modern Green from Beijing, Honeywell, Haworth, FP Innovations, CST Innovations, Pulse Energy, McFarland Marceau Architects Ltd, Equilibrium Consulting Inc., Cooledge Lighting Inc.; Fisher Scientific and Fortis (along with Nexterra and GE). We are also working closely with Cisco  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 13 of 15  and Honeywell. We have active frameworks for collaboration in memoranda of understanding with the City of Vancouver, the City of Kelowna, BC Hydro, the National Research Council; the Climate Action Secretariat and we are inviting others. In fact, I am inviting you. We have a great opportunity in British Columbia. Our provincial government has created powerful incentives to innovate in a lowcarbon economy. Our natural abundance of relatively cheap hydroelectric power challenges us to do this with unparalleled efficiency. Our research-intensive universities such as UBC have over the decades cultivated a large, highly educated and passionately motivated workforce dedicated to sustainability. This environment has spawned a strong, energetic community of clean tech companies – you in this room. BC is a leader for Canada in this sector. We may not be of the sheer size of Germany or China in our ability to invest in this sector, but we have, I believe, many of the components in place to catalyze further growth. But we need to make better use of what we have. UBC’s Living Laboratory makes better use of our minds, our  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 14 of 15  place, and your innovations. For our part, we make these commitments as part of our Sustainability Initiative: We will work with you to explore and exemplify innovative techniques and solutions We will promote, teach and further advance best practices We will leverage federal and provincial funding We will create opportunities to bring you together with our academic community and our operational staff We will work to connect you with a broad network of local, national and international partners And we will acknowledge and value your intellectual property. In return, we ask that you challenge us: Bring us your problems Collaborate with us on research, development and demonstration Help us reach our own Green House Gas targets And share with us our long term vision for the advancement of a civil and sustainable society.  Vancouver Energy Roundtable Keynote 15 June 2011 Page 15 of 15  Ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in a deep and complex conversation about the world in which we are all going to live. We are going to change the world for the better. But we can only do it together. We must not only change the way we use energy, we must change the way we think about our lives in this world, and we must change the way we work with one another. This is what the Living laboratory is for. I hope you will join me in making good use of it. And please—let’s please keep the conversation going. Thank you.  
1.0102604~Hong Kong University centenary keynote address : Presidents’ Summit. "East meets West: synergy, competition and collaboration"~Toope, Stephen J.~Hong Kong University Centenary Keynote Address Presidents’ Summit East Meets West: Synergy, Competition and Collaboration Saturday, December 18, 2011 Vice-Chancellor Tsui [Vice-Chancellor and President, HKU], students, staff, faculty, and alumni of Hong Kong University, esteemed colleagues, friends: it is an honour to join you in celebrating Hong Kong University’s Centenary. Congratulations, and thank you!  Those of us speaking today were asked to address the topic, “East Meets West: Synergy, Competition, and Collaboration.” I’ve decided I want to focus my remarks today on the word in that phrase that seems to be the least important: the word “meets.” And so, let me begin with a story ….  A man sits in the dark on the top deck of a very large ship, all of the northern constellations visible above him in an almost black sky. It’s “bar night” on board, and around him, people are laughing and singing, but the man is in a meditative mood and so he sits at a distance, alone. He hears a small, almost imperceptible sound, and glances down at the drink in his hand just in time to see the ice-cube in it crack. The ice-cube was chipped off an iceberg earlier in the day, and now it releases molecules that had been locked inside a glacier since before modern man appeared on Earth.  The person in my story is Michael Byers, Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at The University of British Columbia. At the  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 2 of 10  time of our story, he is situated on Pond Inlet, at the northern end of Baffin Island, in the Arctic, and he’s traveling aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship Amundsen. The Amundsen is an icebreaker and Professor Byers and his fellow passengers are researchers travelling through the Artctic to measure the environment and the effects of climate change.  As I followed Professor Byers’s progress through the Arctic this past summer, I thought about how the icebreaker is a metaphor for the university: a place unto itself but connected to the wider world; a place of study and research; a place of collaboration and cohabitation; a safe place for significant conversations about sensitive issues, among people of profound difference.  In North America, an “icebreaker” is not only a vessel for creating a way forward where there was none before. We also use that word to describe a joke or game used to help people who don’t know each other relax and open up. A third definition of “icebreaker” is a beginning, a start.  A university should be the place where students, staff, faculty, and alumni begin to discover both the common humanity and the deep difference between them, and where it’s safe enough to explore the discomfort and the vulnerability inherent in such encounters. It should be the place where open, authentic engagement with people whose appearance or customs or worldviews are different from ours becomes an habitual practice.  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 3 of 10  The 20th-century Polish journalist and poet, Ryszard Kapuścioski, said: “Stop. There beside you is another person. Meet him. [Meet her.] This sort of encounter is the greatest event, the most vital experience of all.”  East meets West. North meets South. Here’s my question: What if a successful university experience for our students; what if our success as nations, wherever we may hail from; and what if our success in working together to solve the most pressing global problems of our day all depend upon meeting, and being met? What if our collective success - - becoming greater than the sum of our parts, our competitive edge - - all hang upon meeting, and being met?  Universities are one of the only social institutions to have survived, both intact and wildly changed, since the medieval era. We have proven ourselves crucial to social, economic, and cultural evolution, and capable of staying relevant and competitive even during times of highly accelerated change such as we’ve seen this past century. We are an institution always ahead of its time because our purpose is timeless: to foster student learning; to preserve and increase the store of human knowledge; and to engage with and contribute to the wider society.  However, the great crises of our time—from climate change to pandemic disease to pervasive poverty to the challenges of cultural diversity—persist, and it is my contention that universities around the globe are no longer optimally organized to do what the world needs us to do. We are not yet  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 4 of 10  meeting and engaging with one another at the rate and at the profound level we need to in order to meet these challenges. We need a way forward where none yet exists.We need to be the icebreaker, providing safe passage from isolation and ineffectiveness to engagement and action.  I have described what I believe a great university should be within its own boundaries. It should also be a bridge between communities and between continents. There are two strategies I want to discuss with you today that will allow universities to reorganize and re-imagine ourselves so as to better fulfill our mission. These two strategies are: [1] inviting the world in by making our universities welcoming places for foreign students, and; [2] journeying outward into the world to build much deeper partnerships with one another than we have so far managed to establish.  First, on the topic of foreign students, which Vice-Chancellor Davis has already focused upon – I want to add one point. I am sure I’m not the only one in this room who has heard the arguments—from media, from secondary schools, from parents—against increasing international enrolment, especially in publicly-funded universities. With strong demand raising university entrance averages, some ask, how on earth can UBC allow in more foreign students? After all, they say, isn’t it called The University of British Columbia?  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 5 of 10  Indeed it is, I reply … and each year I find myself strengthening the case for why our international enrolment goals support British Columbia and enhance its place in Canada and the world.  A study of the 10 highest-ranked universities in the world shows that international students comprise an average of 21 percent of the student body, higher than UBC’s current 18 percent. In making the link between international students and a university’s place on the world stage, we have to ask ourselves what edge these out-of-country students provide. The answer? Their perspectives. Their life experiences. Their cultural heritage, their linguistic idiosyncrasies, their unique ways of seeing and being in the world. Every classroom and every dormitory becomes a cross-cultural experiment of sorts. Informal interactions give both the local and the international students otherwise unattainable insights into global society.  International students bring with them their individual gifts and also their extended networks: the family, business, academic, cultural, and social ties that can help us navigate a complex world.  International students also contribute to the global increase of knowledge. Graduate students in particular bring with them the seeds of current and future research collaboration, by tending links among their professors across the global research enterprise. Professors congregate with likeminded colleagues, and these research hubs are in turn magnets for the keenest student minds.  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 6 of 10  Now, let’s examine the second idea, the challenge of partnering with one another more deeply so that we may be better able to address global crises. The complex, three-part mission of universities is not going to change; it is we who must. But what are the limits of reinvention? And what promising models might be pursued?  First of all, let me be clear that I am not talking about wholesale reinvention of the university. As I stated earlier, we’re survivors, and it’s as important to be aware our strengths as it is to address our weaknesses. For example, the mix of conservatism and openness that marks universities, probably due in large measure to our commitment to collegial governance, is a remarkable asset if we can remember to see it as such. Where we have our work cut out for us is any time we try to extend that openness across borders.  Historically, universities were quite naturally cross-cultural, even though they were located in a single physical place. Most of us are familiar with the stories of wandering scholars like Erasmus, who contributed to the academic life of Paris, Leuven, Cambridge, and Basel. We’re currently experiencing a profound need for such scholarly mobility, but our national systems are not cooperating fully. There are still many barriers to international recruitment, such as impaired transferability of credentials, especially among the professions, and narrow-minded visa rules. As well, many of our most important funding mechanisms remain inwardly focused, doing precious little to foster global collaboration.  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 7 of 10  Inviting the world in—from brilliant hiring to attracting the top international students—cannot of itself create the critical mass of talent that’s needed to solve fundamental global problems. We need partners. We must collaborate, not only with other universities but also with community groups, civil society organizations, industry, and government.  And yet, you might be thinking, we’ve built partnerships! We’ve formed networks! We’ve been collaborating! Yes, and I would argue that so far, none of the university networks that arose at the turn of this century has fulfilled its promise. Truly successful networks typically arise in an organic fashion, from the bottom up. We can’t direct this kind of growth hierarchically. But we can, I believe, foster the conditions in which it will happen naturally.  So how do we do this? I offer four possible ways forward:  [1] Seek out existing success, however small, and support it. Let’s ask ourselves: Where are there teams and groups of dedicated and inspired professors and students who are already working together across borders? How can we support them? Can we help them find new partners in other places? Can we assist small, focused and effective networks build the confidence to move to more ambitious global platforms? Can we stop thinking in terms of copying what our competitors are doing, where we all  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 8 of 10  end up doing the same thing, and instead ask how we can commit ourselves to nurturing and expanding existing success?  [2] Challenge national myopia. A lot of us, even those living in smaller states, need to encourage our governments to change rules to allow research funding that crosses borders. That’s how we grow. We need to encourage national research councils to sponsor joint initiatives. We must create opportunities for creative minds to meet.  [3] Know your strengths … and communicate them authentically. Let’s admit it, at least in this room for a start: None of our universities is good at everything. We try, though, don’t we! It’s to everyone’s disadvantage when we spread ourselves thin. There is a staggering range of significant global issues to be addressed. President Mark Wrighton identified some this morning. Let’s ask ourselves: Where are we best placed to make a real difference in collaboration with others? In the case of my own university, UBC, I suspect that we are most likely to contribute in a major way to global solutions on climate change, and sustainability more generally. I anticipate we can also make a real difference in collaborating on the prevention and control of infectious disease, and on intercultural understanding.  But our ability to lead a global effort toward understanding and combating ideological fundamentalism is less apparent. Like all universities, our  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 9 of 10  expertise is not balanced across all areas of research. In UBC’s case, we have a deep knowledge of, and many friendships in, Asia, but we’ve invested less in creating knowledge about the Middle East or Central Asia. This is not a signal that UBC needs to do more Middle East or Central Asian research, but rather a reaffirmation of the necessity for cooperation with those who do.  [4] Nurture global citizens. Inevitably, we focus on research as our means of addressing global problems. But we must never forget that our most important emissaries of that research are our graduates. So the questions we need to answer are these: Are our students being exposed to classes in which they truly confront the problems of our era? Are we doing enough to help them see how they could make a difference in the world? Are enough of them being introduced to perspectives from other cultures, other parts of the world— either through interactions with foreign students on campus or through travel-learning and international community service opportunities?  In conclusion, if we are really going to address the fundamental problems of global society, we can’t just research and preach. We need to act—on our own campuses, yes, but in the communities we serve as well. Are we leaders in economic, environmental, or social sustainability? Are we modeling best practices in intercultural dialogue? Do our own workforce practices address issues of income equality? If not, why not? And if so, how  HKU Centenary Keynote Address 18 December 2011  Page 10 of 10  can we share those strengths with our communities? How can we build on them with our collaborators around the world?  We university leaders can become all too easily preoccupied with superficial measures of success: rising in the university rankings, collecting “trophy” partners, pleasing the media. But East meets West, and North meets South … over a cup of coffee this morning. Here in this room. Side by side over a microscope. In a dormitory room and on the sports field. On an icebreaker in the Arctic.  I will leave you with the idea that we might begin to measure our success this way: by the number of ways and times we allow one human being to meet another—“the greatest event, the most vital experience of all.”  Thank you.  -30-  
1.0102598~APRU 16th Annual Presidents’ Meeting : focus on research as a bridge for building East-West dialogue~Toope, Stephen J.~APRU 16th Annual Presidents’ Meeting June 27-29, 2012 at the University of Oregon Session 1: Shaping Asia-Pacific Higher Education in the 21st Century (June 28) Focus on Research as a Bridge for Building East-West Dialogue  Thank you, Gene [Block, Chancellor, UCLA—session chair], thanks also to our hosts here at the University of Oregon and to the APRU Secretariat. I bring greetings to you all from Canada and from The University of British Columbia. It’s a pleasure to be with you again. Wherever in the world I have traveled this past year, whatever the topic of the gathering, and whomever the audience has been, my message has, at its core, been the same: we need to talk! Across borders and oceans, across barriers of discipline, race, and gender, across politics, economics, and cultures. We need to speak with one another, far more than we are doing now, and with far greater urgency, constancy, and compassion. And here is why: None of the university networks that arose at the end of the 20th century or at the beginning of this one has yet fulfilled its promise. The great crises of our time persist—as we  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 2 of 10  have just heard from climate change to pandemic disease to pervasive poverty to terror and war—and the networks, while rightly intentioned, are not helping to produce solutions at the rate at which they are required. Networks make logical sense, certainly, since individual universities, no matter where we are on the globe, are no longer optimally organized to do what the world needs us to do. But what I have come to believe, because I am seeing it succeed, is that dialogue at every level within and across an institution, as well as between individuals at separate institutions, is the way forward. The kinds of conversations I’m talking about can’t be mandated from the top; they must happen organically. But what we can do—as university presidents and as active members in our international networks—is foster the conditions within which such conversations can take place. When I received an invitation to speak here today, I turned to some of UBC’s top researchers in their respective fields to check my perceptions against theirs. I wanted to know why east-west  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 3 of 10  research partnership, which is prohibitively challenging for so many, was effective and successful for them. I expected some serious answers, and I got them, but as they talked about their projects, what I heard over and over again were words like … excitement. Adventure. Creativity. Friendship. And the word I heard most often? Fun. Twentieth-century Swiss psychologist Carl Jung said, “The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.” The fourth-century Greek philosopher, Plato, said, “You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.” He also said, “Life must be lived as play.” We academics tend not to describe what we do in terms of “play” or “love.” We prefer to leave that vocabulary to the theatre majors and the theologians. But in my conversations with UBC’s Director of the Institute for Asian Research, our Chief Librarian,  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 4 of 10  and an Associate Dean of Medicine, among others, I had to acknowledge that I was speaking with people who are fully engaged with and utterly passionate about their research. Whose love for their research subject has led them to form strong bonds, some now decades old, with fellow researchers throughout the Pacific Rim who feel exactly the same way they do. I had an “Aha!” moment as I realized I may have stumbled upon the driving force that could shape Asia-Pacific higher education in the 21st century. Let me tell you a little about their research …. 1. I asked UBC Chief Librarian Ingrid Parent about the digitization of rare archives, and she answered with a story about Captain Cook. The 18th-century British explorer made several voyages around the globe, and with each trip, he and his fellow travelers collected a treasury of cultural artifacts, artwork, and natural history specimens. Back in Europe, one man might have given a drawing to his hostess when he attended a dinner party. Another might have used shells or carvings as favours or bribes. So what was once a unified view of a particular culture became scattered.  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 5 of 10  Digital technology is recreating that original view; what powers the technology is partnership. There are challenges: Copyright law varies drastically between our countries. Digital character recognition of vernacular Asian scripts is unreliable, and requires the eyes and minds of human partners. Ultimately, it’s the interplay between the technological process and personal encounters that allows these scholars to reassemble a historical worldview that can inform and even reshape our worldview now. 2. Zhichun Jing spends much of his working life in a city that no longer exists. He’s the Canada Research Chair in Pacific-Asia Archaeology, his longtime partners are the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Peking University, and the University of Wisconsin, and his “office” is the lost Shang city of Huanbei. Excavations there uncovered the firstever substantial body of writing in East Asia, and Jing believes the  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 6 of 10  project will contribute to an understanding of how China’s past and future are linked. Canadian as well as Chinese students are helping with the fieldwork, and Jing has seen firsthand the problems that can arise out of cultural and linguistic barriers. “It’s always a risk,” he says, “to work with people from different backgrounds and [to] get students involved in such adventures.” His answer is “… to encourage more interactions with mutual respect …. I tell my colleagues to enjoy [the] frustrations!” he says. “The rewards are great and long-lasting.” 3. There is some decidedly non-traditional Chinese medicine happening in China right now, thanks to a number of medical partnerships. UBC’s Dr. Weihong Song is conducting human clinical trials of a drug that could help prevent Alzheimer’s Disease. Dr. Peter Leung partnered with researchers at my colleague Yang’s university, Zhejiang, over 20 years ago to build a collaborative research centre in reproductive medicine, and it’s  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 7 of 10  been so successful that UBC has just entered into a new partnership with Peking University Health Science Centre. What all three projects share is their need for large patient populations—larger than Canada can provide. Our Chinese partners have met that need, and added their expertise. UBC’s Dr. Kendall Ho oversees yet another partnership, with Chinese researchers, China’s Ministry of Health, and Chinese regional health authorities. Its goal is to assist China’s policy makers in reforming their primary health care system. Dr. Ho describes the partnership as “symbiotic” and is committed to involving students from both countries to make it sustainable over the long term and to get to the scale needed to make a real difference in people’s lives. He says, “While [the] challenge [of] access to care is common [to] both rural China and [rural] Canada, a significant difference is scale: a rural Canadian community might have a population of 100 [people] … yet a rural Chinese community has a population of tens … if not hundreds of thousands.” It is of interest to both countries, he says, to know how to scale up.  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 8 of 10  Finally. A professor with UBC Fisheries Centre, and Director of the Nippon Foundation-UBC Nereus Program, Dr. Villy Christensen knows something about scale. Villy and the Nereus partners are studying the impact that climate change is having on life in the world’s oceans, and working to find solutions. Because ocean life affects all planetary life, and because insights are needed from fields as diverse as habitat science, marine biology, market demand for fish, food security, and governance, the Nereus partnership transcends both geographical and disciplinary boundaries. Their aim is to influence policy-making in international fora such as UNEP, 1 UNESCO, and UNCLOS. His advice for other researchers who need answers to urgent global questions? “Get out of your comfort zone.” He says, “I love working in my little corner. But … I want to contribute to ensuring that there will be … a healthy ocean for future generations [and] it 1  UNEP=UN Environment Program; UNESCO=UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; IOC=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission; UNCLOS=UN Convention on the Law of the Sea  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 9 of 10  goes beyond my expertise to do so. It is only by working with colleagues, policy makers, and stakeholders that we have a chance of actually contributing to change. It calls for … talking new languages (in the disciplinary sense) and getting an understanding [of] what other disciplines consider important … for progress. The reward … is learning how other disciplines—or cultures—see the challenges, and how we jointly can work toward solutions.” Conclusion We can fear the problem—whether it’s an international legal dispute, Alzheimer’s Disease, or an ocean devoid of life—or we can love the process of searching for a solution, risks, challenges, frustrations and all. The distinction may seem small, like two sides of the same coin, but I believe that in that distinction lies the pathway to the partnerships and the conversations and the dialogue that we in this room keep saying we want to see happen. That distinction prompts an entirely new set of questions for us, as university leaders: What role might ‘play’ have in ending  APRU 2012 Professor Stephen Toope, UBC 28 June 2012 Page 10 of 10  poverty? Excitement, in tackling economic disparity? How can we foster daring in the face of devastating disease? Friendship in place of fear? Clear, frank speech in place of silence? Because I believe this is our job now. Play, excitement, fun, daring, and dialogue—these are the qualities common to the researchers who are speaking successfully across cultures. They’re the same qualities that led them to pursue their research subjects in the first place—but instead of just turning them inward in inquiry, they’ve risked turning them outward as well, in friendship - seeking out equally passionate and daring colleagues around the Asia-Pacific. Friendship can’t be mandated. But it can be taught, and fostered; it is best taught by example. And so I look forward to exploring these ideas, and those of my co-panelists, with you—my friends and colleagues—today and in the coming year. Thank you. -30-  
1.0102613~2011 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~2011 Fall Congregation  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  23-25 November 201  1  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2011.  Worried. Anxious. Uncertain. We hear those words a lot these days, mostly in relation to the global economy, but also with respect to our own personal futures. The media focuses on young people who can’t find jobs, on cuts that may come in government budgets, resulting in further job losses. It wouldn’t be surprising if many of you were feeling just a little unsettled as you contemplate your graduation into what may seem like a rather harsh world. Perhaps my job today is to bring you some better news: you are not alone. Yes, it is true that you are graduating into a confusing and sometimes troubling world. You will all face problems and unfairness and choices that are very hard. But you are not alone. Consider this story, told to me many years ago by a wonderful monk: In Persia, for many centuries now, fathers have taught their sons how to make richly coloured carpets. The boys learn, often from a very early age, by sitting on the father’s lap or on a workbench sitting very close and watching Father work. But the boys do not merely observe; every now and then the father will cease tying knots and will encourage the son to take over – in this way, the art is passed on. Now, unskilled fingers are not reliable, and often a boy will make a mistake. When the boy does err, the father will not chastise, nor will he correct the mistake, for it is an element of the master carpet-maker’s art to use the error to subtly reformulate the  2  pattern. The father accepts the son’s error and weaves it into the pattern of a carpet they create together. In repeating the story, I am not romanticizing child labour. But stories have layers of meaning; that is why they are the essential route to human understanding. The surface of the carpet-weavers’ story is about ancient traditions, gender roles, hard labour, and children having to work far too young. But another level of the story is about the sharing of tradition, a sense that in everything we do we build on the work of those who have come before, and the idea that we all make mistakes that form the warp and weft of our lives. We only hope that there are folk out there – parents, friends and mentors – who can help us learn to use those mistakes productively. The talented Lebanese-Canadian writer, Rawi Hage, escaped from Lebanon during the civil war of the 1980s. After a harrowing few years in New York, working in warehouses and living on the edge of homelessness, he came to Montreal. His first novel, De Niro’s Game, is a deeply disturbing, but evocative, description of how a couple of young men try to survive in war-torn Beirut. It won the prestigious IMPAC Dublin Literary Prize in 2008. Part of the winning citation reads: De Niro’s Game is…a compassionate novel of friendship and betrayal, of love and loss. The war-torn city of Beirut plays host to the bravura of the young men – a city full of marauding militia, cleverly compared with the mad dogs that also haunt its precincts—a city that gradually drags its inhabitants into the blood-red sands of extreme situations and heart-breaking betrayal. 3  As you can tell, this is not a happy story. But note that despite its subject matter, the novel is described as “compassionate” and as “a novel of friendship.” In his acceptance speech for the IMPAC Dublin Prize, 1 despite the real suffering he has endured, Hage describes himself as a “fortunate man”. His speech is one of extended gratitude: first to “all those women and men of letters, and all artists who have gone beyond the aesthetics of the singular to represent the multiple and diverse, to all those men and women who have chosen the painful and costly portrayal of truth over tribal self-righteousness.” What a powerful way of standing on the shoulders of giants; recognizing that we can draw on the work of our forbearers. We are not alone. Then Hage thanks his father “who always surrounded me and my brothers with books and stories of travel and wonder.” Just like tying the wool of the carpet together, mistakes and all. Finally, he thanks his mother “who hid me under the dining room table away from the falling bombs, and whose farewell tears on the day of my leaving my native Lebanon are printed in my memory.” The courage to protect and the courage to let go: emotions that I imagine many parents are experiencing in this beautiful hall right now. Despite its problems, despite the difficulties that we all will face, our world is no cause for fear alone. What Hage’s work, and that of so many great artists, reveals is that even in the hardest moments, there is always promise and there is always hope. The dark ages give way to the Renaissance, Charles Darwin overcomes the death of his beloved daughter to share brilliant empirical insights that still shape our understanding of life, Van Gogh succumbs to mental illness but produces 1  Reprinted as Rawi Hage, “To roam a borderless world” The Globe and Mail, 13 June 2008, A15.  4  some of the greatest art of his century, the flight from Dunkirk becomes the landings on the beaches of Normandy. In the words of the great AngloIrish poet, Louis MacNeice: For it is true, surprises break and make As when the baton falls, and all together the hands On the fiddle bows are pistons, or when, crouched above His books the scholar suddenly understands What he has thought for years – or when the inveterate rake Finds for once that his lust is becoming love. -from Mutations  As you celebrate this great day of graduation, my hope for you is that “surprises break and make” you. Worried. Anxious. Uncertain. Promise. Hope. Perseverance. As we at UBC like to say, Tuum Est, it’s up to you. And that’s right…but you are not alone. Thank you.  5  
1.0102596~Innovation, international collaboration go hand in hand~Toope, Stephen J.~Originally appeared in The Vancouver Sun, 10 February 2012  Innovation, International Collaboration Go Hand in Hand By Stephen J. Toope and Alan I. Leshner The global population explosion of the past century, unprecedented in human history, poses a thorny tangle of interconnected challenges. With the population expected to reach 9.3 billion by 2050, meeting human needs and addressing climate change will require science-based answers to urgent questions about food, energy, water, disease prevention and many other issues. Increasingly, innovation will hinge upon international research collaborations as modern science becomes an ever-more global enterprise, transcending national boundaries. At the same time, strong, consistent support for basic as well as applied research will underpin scientific progress to improve human welfare. By selecting Vancouver as the setting for the world’s largest general scientific conference, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) sought to celebrate multi-national collaboration as a critical ingredient for innovation. The meeting’s theme, “Flattening the World: Building a Global Knowledge Society,” set forth by AAAS President Nina Fedoroff, further highlights the importance of international research. Knowledge flows across borders. Key advances—from wireless telegraphy and the discovery of life’s genetic blueprint, to the development of penicillin and vaccines—take place all over the globe, often resulting from the collective brain power of many scientists working cooperatively. The late Michael Smith, a renowned University of British Columbia researcher, was born in England, moved to Vancouver in the 1950s, collaborated with U.S. colleagues to co-found a biotechnology company, and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993. His development of a crucial genetic-engineering technique called sitedirected mutagenesis made it possible to alter the DNA sequence of any gene. Current Vancouver-based examples of international research abound: Simon Fraser University physicist Michael Vetterli, a TRIUMF scientist, will soon head to Geneva to chair an influential committee related to the ATLAS particle detector, which is probing the forces that have shaped the universe. Similarly, the work of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics is inherently global, involving researchers worldwide in the quest for a deeper understanding of the natural world. Special student training and international scholars programs at the Perimeter Institute help to encourage collaboration across disciplines and regions. UBC faculty member Karen Bakker, whose AAAS presentation will take place February 17, exemplifies the current generation of scientists. An expert on a wide range of water issues, she is fluent in French and Spanish and has conducted research in Southeast Asia, southern Africa, Latin America and Europe. Much of the responsibility for building and maintaining international research connections falls to research institutions and scientists. We must expand our international perspective whenever possible, join in multi-national projects, and serve as mentors when colleagues in developing nations ask for our help. One outstanding response to this challenge has been from Mitacs, the non-profit Canadian research consortium, whose Globalink program enables students from India, China, Brazil and Mexico to  conduct research at a Canadian university and meet leaders of Canadian industries. Through our universities, an array of mobility programs facilitates the loan of talented Canadian researchers and students to international markets, returning savvy global citizen-scientists. Mobility programs also enhance the country’s status as a desirable proving ground for graduates from nations such as China and India. Government, too, has a critical role, and in particular, by providing adequate, consistent support for basic science. Viewing innovation exclusively through the narrow lens of short-term economic outputs can close the door on crucial breakthroughs from basic research. Michael Smith’s research was a prime example of the value of basic science: His fundamental investigations yielded practical results only after being paired with the applied research of Kary Mullis, who shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The invention of polymerase chain reaction technology by Mullis let researchers exploit Smith’s technique to unravel the structure and function of genes and proteins. In the United States, further progress is needed to untangle red tape related to visa restrictions that impede international research. Globally, our support for basic science and international collaborations must not waiver. If we are to combat emerging diseases and climate change, and provide food and clean drinking water for a growing global population, we must effectively tap the powerful, combined talents of scientists and engineers worldwide. As Subra Suresh, the director of the U.S. National Science Foundation has said: “Good science anywhere is good for science everywhere.” What do you think about these issues? Please join us February 16-20 for the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) as it convenes in Vancouver for the first time ever. Stephen J. Toope is the 12th president and vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia. Alan I. Leshner is chief executive officer of the AAAS and executive publisher of the journal Science.  
1.0102600~Create UBC Okanagan~Toope, Stephen J.~Create UBC Okanagan Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia O Canada. It’s a beautiful anthem, isn’t it? Especially as sung by Kyla [de Jong, 2nd-year Arts student at UBCO]. We all hum [sing?] along with her, we all sing along with Mark Donnelly during Canucks games. Most of us know all the words … and you international students may soon learn them. Do you remember, by any chance, when you first learned the words to “O Canada?” Maybe you were actually living somewhere else in the world, and heard them on television, maybe even during the Olympics. Maybe you were in the process of becoming a Canadian citizen. Or maybe you were six years old when you first learned those words, sitting cross-legged on the floor of your elementary school gymnasium with what seemed like thousands of other kids, half excited, half scared, everything new, nothing familiar—your very first student assembly. Words. They’re funny things. Some words, the more you use them, the less they mean. Like “awesome,” or “synergy,” or “like, whatever.” Other words, like the lyrics to “O Canada,” take on new and deeper layers of meaning the longer you live with them.  Create UBC Okanagan 6 September 2011 Page 2 of 5  Two such words, words that I think may be among the most powerful in the English language, are IMAGINE and CREATE. Why? Simple answer, really: Because that’s what we’re here to do. And I don’t just mean today; I mean for the whole of your university career. Some might even say it’s what we’re here to do with our lives. Imagination and creation may be the only two skills we’re born with, that we don’t need to be taught or trained how to use. Your parents unpack the new 22-inch TV, you spot the empty carton and see … a race car. They can’t afford the Barbie Dream House® so you make one out of shoeboxes and toilet paper rolls. The park next to your school is a magic forest. Your back porch is a Broadway stage. You write stories, rehearse shows, play in a band, draft plans, build forts, train every morning at dawn, look at the world through a microscope, the universe through a telescope, build a car from the engine up, shoot movies, learn codes and languages, invent iPhone apps … all to get … here. To IMAGINE. To CREATE. We call this first day at UBC “IMAGINE” in Vancouver, and “CREATE” in the Okanagan. The names signify that here, at this extra-ordinary time in your life, you’re about to put your skills into practice at a whole new level. The two events have different names because you can’t have one without the other.  Create UBC Okanagan 6 September 2011 Page 3 of 5  Picture it: Imagination without creation stays forever in the realm of fantasy. It leads to frustration. And creation without imagination lacks vision and forethought and power. It leads to mediocrity. But together, they are the foundation of every triumph, great or small, that humankind has ever achieved. So how do you get from IMAGINATION to CREATION? Well, for me, it’s a short flight on a very small airplane. For you, the answer is … play. That’s right: play. Surprised? You thought I was going to say “hard work,” didn’t you? Well, that starts next week. Psychologist Carl Jung said, “The creative mind plays with the object it loves.” Today is a reminder to follow your passions during these next few years—in the classes you choose, the clubs you join, the questions you ask, the people you meet, and the new ideas and perspectives you make your own. To the degree that the hard work of the next few years becomes play, you will find yourself able to take what you imagine and make it real in the physical world. It sounds like magic, doesn’t it? You might be wondering at this point what a university president is doing talking about play and imagination and creation and magic. Maybe you’re asking yourself, Is this a West Coast thing? Should I have gone to U of T after all? But before the future engineers and physicists and commerce  Create UBC Okanagan 6 September 2011 Page 4 of 5  students get too worried, let me share just a few more powerful words from some other powerful voices: Physicist Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Business leader Peter Drucker said, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” World-renowned educator Sir Ken Robinson said, “Creativity is as important as literacy.” And artist Pablo Picasso said, “Everything you can imagine is real.” What university is for, this university in particular, is to give your mind every opportunity to play with the objects it loves. Ideas, theories, questions, problems, philosophies, blueprints, equations, formulae, stories, symptoms, statistics, and songs. We call UBC “a place of mind” and a world of worlds is about to open up for your mind to play with. So dream big! Today is meant to give you a taste of what you might yet create if only you let your imagination loose. Look around you! This is your playground, and these are your co-creators. These people will inform your ideas, challenge your ideals, and change your mind. You will do the same for them.  Create UBC Okanagan 6 September 2011 Page 5 of 5  When I was your age, a young man wrote a song about coming together to imagine a better world. All these decades later  it is still the anthem, the “O Canada” for all those of us who are committed to creating that world. You probably know the words: Imagine all the people Living life in peace ... Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people Sharing all the world In whatever your chosen area of study, in whatever your chosen field of work … imagine that. Choose that. Create that. I wish you every success with your studies, and look forward to the day we’re all together again, upon your graduation. Welcome to the University of British Columbia.  
1.0102615~Rapid transit for UBC-Broadway corridor key to economic success : it’s North America’s busiest bus corridor~Robertson, Gregor~ Rapid transit for UBC-Broadway corridor key to economic success  It?s North America?s busiest bus corridor By Gregor Robertson and Stephen Toope, Special to The Vancouver Sun March 5, 2013 Every day, 110,000 people travel through the UBC-Broadway corridor by transit. Whether you drive or take the bus, you know our transit system exceeds capacity, and it?s choking the Metro Vancouver region. Over half a million bus riders are passed up annually ? that?s 2,000-plus pass-ups every weekday ? and once you do get on a bus, chances are you?re standing for your entire trip. Now add an extra 150,000 people. That?s how many more people will be living and working in the corridor by 2040 ? and the majority of them will be taking transit. The UBC-Broadway corridor is North America?s busiest bus corridor ? and with 50 per cent of transit users from outside of Vancouver, it serves the entire Metro Vancouver region. That?s because, after downtown, its B.C.?s second largest employment centre, with more jobs than the next eight town centres combined. It?s also Western Canada?s largest health care precinct, with millions of British Columbians visiting VGH, UBC Hospital and BC Cancer Agency each year. The University of British Columbia, our largest university, contributes $10 billion to our economy each year and anchors the corridor. With more than 150 spinoff companies, UBC innovations support one of North America?s fastest growing life sciences and technology hubs, which is growing twice as fast as the rest of the B.C. economy. A report released by KPMG last week outlines the tremendous economic opportunity that exists within the corridor. With job and employment growth projections from just two years ago already being surpassed, and new office and research space being developed along Broadway and at UBC, we have the ability to secure our position as a global leader in health research and life sciences. With our natural beauty, highly skilled workforce and major research institutions, Vancouver is in a strong position to compete with ? and for ? the world?s best and brightest. But our failing transportation system puts this massive economic potential at risk. Cities with world-class technology hubs like Toronto, London and New York all have rapid transit to connect their job corridors with top academic institutions, enabling efficient movement of goods and people. The KPMG report found that these cities have a competitive advantage over Vancouver when it comes to attracting and retaining top talent and investment in technology opportunities. A reliable, efficient public transit system is crucial to ensuring local companies can thrive and compete with businesses from around the world. When it comes to the UBC-Broadway corridor, rapid transit is the only solution. Studies done by TransLink and the City of Vancouver show that bus capacity along the corridor is maxed out, and a streetcar system would be unable to handle the population growth we know is coming. With four rapid transit lines feeding in to Broadway between Commercial and Cambie ? the Expo, Millennium and Canada Lines, and soon the Evergreen Line ? the demand for better, faster east/west transit through the corridor to UBC is only going to grow. At a time when the future of B.C.?s economy is top of mind, we have an opportunity to build on the strengths that exist right in our backyard. Without rail-based rapid transit along the UBC-Broadway corridor, we can?t meet the significant growth that is coming our way, and stand to lose out on new investment in our economy, with top talent moving to other cities. Instead of developing medical breakthroughs and launching new high-tech companies, we?ll be stuck in gridlock ? literally ? as cars and buses fight for space on a road that does not have any more space to give. On day one, a UBC-Broadway rapid transit line will have more riders than the Canada Line. A rapid transit system that connects UBC to the Broadway corridor and the entire region is an investment that makes good economic sense today ? and is crucial for the future of our province. Gregor Robertson is mayor of Vancouver. Stephen Toope is president of the University of British Columbia.

So much to do. So little time. How, then, are we to turn our attention to the great work of our lives? At what point will we be willing to trust the canvas to the artist inside?  Tonight is about that voyage. Outward into space to look back at the Earth; and then down, into the cities of Cairo, Tehran, Zahle and Izmir; and then further still, but inward, to the imaginative and meditative spaces inside of ourselves, the seat of our emotional lives, our existential understandings, our spiritual aspirations. The home of the artist inside each of us.  The exhibit itself is its own voyage, and you may find yourself flying through these rooms, like a tourist with a checklist, determined to see it all. Like their lands of origin, though, these works offer more to see and know than the mind could grasp in a lifetime of looking.  And then there is the matter of your heart. Perhaps you will ?reach out to   Safar/Voyage Pre-Opening Event?MOA    Stephen J. Toope, UBC   Page 3 another door? and through it find just one painting or photograph or sculpture that calls you to attend to it. You won?t think about your choice; the artist inside you will make it for you. She will recognize her reflection instantly. Like these works, she abides by rhythms other than those dictated by clocks and calendars. Stillness. Sacred time. Profound attention. We all of us have an enormous capacity for these things, yet our daily lives no longer call them forth. But they are called for here.  You will encounter artwork tonight the meaning of which your mind will devour whole and feed to your heart. And then there will be the pieces that bypass the mind completely and speak directly to your heart in its own language. If you are able to let your mind hold what it sees and hears?of colonialism and war, revolution and diaspora, conflict and community, identity and diversity?while your heart is engaged in that conversation, you will leave here transformed.

To break your heart open with images that cannot be borne by today?s version of who you are. And to require you to transform, so that with your new eyes you can see the possibilities for solution that it intimates.  That is what art is for.  That is what a university is for. To call our profound attention to the things that matter. And then to break us open and transform us into the versions of ourselves that are capable of creating change. That broken heart we spend our energies avoiding is in fact the beginning of our expansion, the birthplace of our compassion. We should not be the same after we have made this voyage; we should be new people, with new minds and hearts, whose sensibilities and understanding transcend borders and nationalities.

It is the question our students begin to answer when they arrive, and a journey that is well underway by the time they leave. Those of us here tonight began our journeys long ago, many of us with art as our catalyst and a university as the place where we first said yes, as if we?d been ready for that moment from before the beginning of the universe. I?m delighted, and so grateful, that our journeys have converged here tonight. On behalf of the University of British Columbia, welcome.  And thank you.

1.0102622~Letter to the community~Toope, Stephen J.~                           Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 1 of 6         OVERVIEW Welcome to the new academic year. It’s very gratifying to look back on a year filled with initiatives that continue to position UBC as one of the top ranked research universities in the world. It is due to your work and your commitment to our collective vision that UBC continues to garner ever-stronger attention locally and globally. Thank you.  I am pleased to report on progress towards our priorities as committed to in Place and Promise: The UBC Plan. Connected by Commitment: The UBC Annual Report provides details on key initiatives and events of the past year. In this letter, I will focus on three of our commitment areas: student learning, research excellence, and international engagement; talk about our shared work environment by highlighting our budget, government realities, and some of our crucial supports; and highlight our strength as a community.  STUDENT LEARNING Universities are finding themselves required to transform yet again, thanks to new learning technologies and new understandings about how people learn. As a sector we must adapt to stay relevant for today’s students. Our approach at UBC focuses on our flexible learning initiative, bringing together proven and new learning concepts to provide an enhanced learning environment for all our students. This initiative includes experiential learning, flipped classrooms, new approaches to classroom teaching, in-classroom adoption of new technologies, and online learning.   We’re lucky; this kind of transformation has long been part of UBC’s DNA. The Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative propelled us forward and the changes continue across all faculties under the name “flexible learning.” We know that our students have increased retention of course material with these methods, and students tell us they’re keen to take courses that offer innovative ways to learn.  We recently put out a call internally for flexible learning proposals and received over 60 responses. Forty will be funded, affecting 100 courses and roughly 30,000 students. UBC also joined Coursera, providing four massive open on line courses (MOOCs) this year that collectively had over _,000,000 learners enrolled from almost every province and country in the world.  These were well received, with requests that they be repeated.  UBC’s Vancouver School of Economics opened this year, with over 2,100 applications for 80 student spaces in the new Bachelor of International Economics degree. The first cohort will arrive this month.   Health disciplines at UBC are seeking a new organizational framework, and a university-wide committee is currently reviewing proposals. The goals are: greater interdisciplinary collaboration and research; more interprofessional learning; improved effectiveness of the curriculum and practice education; and facilitation of                            Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 2 of 6        UBC’s working relationships with the health system. We’re seeking to reduce fragmentation and inconsistencies in the current structure, and improve efficiencies in the operational support networks (e.g. Finance, IT).   Supporting Aboriginal learners remains a UBC priority. We graduated the largest number of Aboriginal students in our history last year.. The University of Manitoba and UBC successfully bid to create a permanent Truth and Reconciliation Commission National Research Centre. An Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Group is working to establish a more integrated approach to UBC’s Aboriginal health initiatives.  The university continues to innovate with respect to supporting students and student life. The Student Interactions Transformation Program is now fully underway. Its components include a learning management system upgrade, an online advising management system, an early alert protocol to identify students at risk, enhanced student evaluation of teaching, broad based admissions, and dedicated enrolment management specialists for all students.  In athletics, I have worked with the Canada West Working Group and university presidents across the country to develop principles to improve Canadian university sports, making our programs more attractive to scholar-athletes through enhanced support. We will take a proposal to pilot the principles with high-performance women’s hockey to presidents and athletic directors in October. Here at home, we welcomed international sport program leader Ashley Howard as our new Managing Director, Athletics.  Sneak preview: Across the university, we are conceiving a new initiative that would make UBC the world’s healthiest university. This initiative will encompass the health and well-being of students, staff, and faculty, so I hope you will participate in the university-wide consultation that will take place this year.  RESEARCH EXCELLENCE I am proud to report that research performance continues to be a key UBC strength. I cannot stress enough, however, that in our competitive world where research funding is under great pressure, collaboration and partnership are crucial in building our research capacity from this point forward.  Last year, we formed partnerships internationally with Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute in clean energy and with the Max Planck Society in quantum materials; nationally with U of T and U of A on Indian research through IC-IMPACTS; and provincially with SFU on the Canadian International Institute for Extractive Industries and Development, to name but a few. Over 7,500 ISI-indexed journal articles were published by UBC scholars, with 63 per cent published in the most influential scholarly journals in the world and 44 per cent with international collaborations. My congratulations.                             Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 3 of 6        UBC continues to perform strongly in national competitions, with the award of two Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) in Digital Media Research and Innovation, and Quantum Materials and Devices. Our increase in Tri-Council grants over the past three years has meant that two additional Canada Research Chairs were redistributed to UBC.   Our research strength lies not just in our ability to attract funding and win awards, however, but also in attracting and retaining leading faculty and students. While many of you are necessarily focused on obtaining grants and conducting research, my focus is on strengthening those supports that help you do your work.  To this end, improving the recruitment and retention of graduate students will be a priority this year. A review of the Faculty of Graduate Studies was completed in preparation for hiring a new Dean, a process currently underway. Four-year funding packages are in place for graduate students and we have committed to increase this pool by $350,000 in 2013/14, with a recurring two per cent annual increase thereafter. Most programs now have mechanisms to fund students for a fifth year. I continue to be concerned about the time to completion rates, especially in many doctoral programs. We are looking at the structural components of the PhD to find ways to compress or reduce program requirements without compromising the value of the degree.   The cost of childcare and housing continue to be of concern particularly as it relates to retention and recruitment. Additional childcare spaces have been added and more are planned. Earlier this year we announced the Housing Action Plan, now in its implementation phase. This plan will improve housing affordability and choice on the Vancouver campus for faculty, staff and students.    Through the Living Laboratory Initiative, UBC is partnering with private industry and government to tackle societal issues. We are collaborating with Cisco on smart energy technologies, implementing wireless electrical vehicle charging stations, and partnering with local companies in energy storage. Last year we opened the Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Facility, designed to eliminate nine per cent of campus greenhouse gas emissions.   Work is now underway on an Innovation Strategy for the university that will maximize economic and societal benefits by streamlining and diversifying the knowledge transfer process beyond UBC’s core academic mission. The roll-out has begun with the redesigned e@UBC program and will be followed by other elements of the strategy over the next year. My final address to the Vancouver Board of Trade, on September 11, will address this exciting new direction for the university, and I will communicate more to the community as a whole in coming months.  INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT I am often asked why UBC pays so much attention to developing its international capabilities. Why do we include ‘global citizens’ in our vision statement?  Are we using international students to balance the budget?  The short answer is that                            Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 4 of 6        teaching methodologies aren’t the only thing undergoing transformation because of new technologies; massive change is happening at societal level as well. We are now globally connected across countries and cultures, and we must provide our students with the ability to work with people who are different from themselves. The international is not ‘out there,’ it is who we are in BC and in Canada.  Last year, 44 per cent of our published journal articles were coauthored with international collaborators; we have 261 active student mobility partnerships in 41 countries and international learning opportunities in 71 countries; 23 per cent of our faculty are international; and seven per cent undergraduate, 16 per cent masters and 35 per cent doctoral students at the Okanagan campus, and 14 per cent undergraduate, 24 per cent masters and 39 per cent doctoral students at the Vancouver campus are international as well. Our surrounding communities, especially in the Lower Mainland, are strikingly diverse.  To support our research and student activities internationally, this past year, in addition to the research and student agreements, we have reviewed our international support structure and are implementing a new approach that I hope will enhance coordination of our international work and communication of international connections and initiatives across the university.  We have begun the search for an Executive Director, International who will work closely with faculties, not to create international opportunities but to facilitate and communicate faculty and department-based initiatives.   The UBC Vancouver Senate and the Board of Governors approved UBC Vantage College and it will accept its first cohort in 2014. UBC Vantage College will offer programs that broaden the capacity of the university to attract outstanding international students. Orchard Commons, our second multi-purpose student housing complex, will provide space for the academic program for the College, as well as student beds, activity space, dining hall and childcare spaces.  We have paid close attention to developing initiatives in China and India, as committed to in Place and Promise. A China Council has been implemented to coordinate and facilitate initiatives with China; a strategic cooperation agreement is in place with Chongqing for joint development of academic initiatives and collaborative research. In addition to being part of IC-IMPACTS, which brings together Canadian and Indian education institutions, community, industry and government partners, UBC opened its Delhi Office. I also appointed Dr. Sujatha Ramdorai as my Senior Advisor on India. Dr. Weihong Song continues in his role as my Senior Advisor on China.  BUDGET UBC’s operating budget remains fiscally and structurally balanced for the fourth year in a row, including at the faculty and unit level. This despite global economic uncertainty and governments’ tight control on spending. Provincial funding has declined to 45 per cent of the total operating budget, so diversification strategies are in place, including advancing recovery of the indirect costs of research, carefully                            Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 5 of 6        building our cohort of outstanding international students, and creating new professional programs.  Overall research funding remains constrained and support for core research dollars, including indirect costs, continues to be a top advocacy imperative for me at both the federal and provincial levels.   GOVERNMENT Federally, the budget continues to be carefully managed, with the Conservative majority government driving to implement austerity measures to return to a balanced budget. I have been leading the advocacy for the Advantage Canada Research Excellence Fund (ACRE) proposed by UBC, McGill and the University of Toronto to U15 to increase the global competitiveness of Canadian universities. This initiative was acknowledged in the last federal budget, and we were charged with completing a proposal. The U15 is working closely with AUCC to bring forward a widely supported approach.  Provincially, with the return of the government, the research portfolio was transferred back to the Ministry of Advanced Education, which is a better fit. The provincial government will move forward on the budget introduced in the spring which will see funding for the post-secondary system constrained for the next two fiscal years. Working with partner institutions and the Research Universities’ Council of BC, UBC will build on pre-election work and advocate for the value of post-secondary education to the Province and to foster a competitive provincial research framework.  UBC continues to work with the City of Vancouver and City of Kelowna to advance our academic and social objectives. In Vancouver, we have made significant progress in positioning rail rapid transit to UBC as a regional and provincial priority. That work must continue. In Kelowna, a potential dispute in the land use classification of the new West Campus (formerly the Tutt Lands) of the Okanagan campus has been resolved.  SUPPORTING UBC’S STRATEGIC GOALS start an evolution, UBC’s development and alumni engagement campaign, has now passed the $1.2 billion mark. The campaign helps diversify our funding and provides support for academic priorities across campus. The campaign set a goal of doubling engagement of alumni with the university to 50,000 annually, and we have already surpassed 45,095. A new governance structure for the Alumni Association Board of Directors was instituted which will enable more robust activity and clarity in the UBC-Alumni Association relationship.  UBC Finance has adopted the distributed-integrated model of organization, already in place in Development and IT. The goal is to ensure a high level of technical competence at the Faculty and unit levels with joint reporting to a central unit to ensure coherence and collaboration. This model is now being implemented in Communications.                            Office of the President Letter to the Community September 2013         Page 6 of 6         In December 2012, the university and the Faculty Association signed a pay equity agreement that ensures starting Faculty salaries are gender equitable; and that practices in recruitment, retention, promotion and merit are also equitable. We reviewed our Equity and Diversity structure, and we’re implementing a new approach to better support the needs of our community and to make the promotion of inclusion more dynamic across UBC.  UBC took a bold leadership position in Canada in choosing to opt out of costly and duplicative Access Copyright licensing. We continue to work with partners across Canada to ensure full legal compliance with copyright law while reducing costs for our students.   OUR STRENGTH AS A COMMUNITY This past year brought us much change, but also highlighted our great strengths. Integration of our campuses, faculties and units, as well as differentiation within the system are both important. It is this tension that keeps UBC on a rapidly ascending, forward trajectory. We are ambitious and we have proven ourselves up for change.   Despite continued instability in the economic climate, UBC is in a much stronger budgetary position than many of our leading sister universities across Canada and around the world. In the coming year, we will be able to deploy resources toward transformation and innovation that support Place and Promise goals, even while being fiscally prudent. In other words, we can enhance UBC’s already strong standing as a leading global university.   But there is simply no room for complacency. As a community, we must work together internally, and with communities and partners externally, to articulate our social, cultural and economic value. Your continued support in this effort is essential, and greatly appreciated. Together we will build a stronger and even more influential UBC.  Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor   
1.0102624~Our relationship with Korea needs a reset~Edwards, Len~|Our relationship with Korea needs a reset By Len Edwards and Stephen Toope || Nov 27, 2013  Published on http://www.ipolitics.ca/ As Canada and Korea celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the relationship is at a crossroads. There is a sense of crisis. After decades of success and mutual benefit, the relationship has lost much of its energy. This was the conclusion of a recent meeting of the Canada-Korea Forum, a non-governmental group of Koreans and Canadians that confers annually on the state of relations and how governments, businesses and citizens might derive further benefit from them. Canada has been important to Korea. It has supported Korea’s growth as a source of resources and a market for its manufactured goods. It has encouraged its emergence as a free and democratic country. It has served as Korea’s second ‘gateway’ to North America. Korea has been important to Canada. It has been one of Canada’s largest trading partners, and a principal market for its commodities. It has been a source of investment. It has sent us a dynamic community of new Canadians. It has been a key ‘gateway’ for Canada to the Asia Pacific. Times change. Conditions change. We must now find a new paradigm for the relationship that reflects the changes in Korea’s place in the world as a developed country, and Canada’s current interests and strengths as a bilateral partner and major international player. The starting point is our economic relationship. This has been the backbone of Korea-Canada ties. It must be strengthened and re-energized through conscious efforts by governments and business. For this to happen, Canadian and Korean governments must finally conclude their Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Fortunately, Prime Minister Harper and President Park recently agreed this should be done by the end of 2013. This will create an updated foundation for a 21st century trade and investment relationship. It will re-vitalize business interest in growing commercial ties. If these efforts fail, the prospects are dire. Other countries with FTAs with Korea and Canada will enjoy more advantageous terms in these markets. Bilateral trade will decline. The trust and interest built up in past decades will erode. Inevitably, this will negatively affect other areas of our economic relationship as well as on our political ties. In the new formula for Canada-Korea relations, the energy sector stands out as never before. Major complementarities exist over the long-term. Both countries should formally elevate energy sector cooperation to the rank of a “principal interest”. Governments should put in place undertakings that recognize this long-term objective and that encourage/facilitate private sector ventures. These arrangements could be linked to or included in the FTA under negotiation. Another historical pillar of the Canada-Korea partnership has been our shared concerns for international peace and security. On this 60th anniversary of the armistice ending the Korean War, Canada remains fully committed to supporting the Republic of Korea in dealing with the North Korean threat. This cooperation can now be expanded as Korea’s President Park broadens her country’s involvement in security matters outside the Peninsula. As developed democracies of similar economic weight, Canada and Korea should be able to work together as “constructive” powers. Our two governments could announce an initiative to determine how best Canada and Korea can cooperate in areas of greatest mutual interest and potential effectiveness, starting with Asia Pacific security issues. This could include cooperation in humanitarian assistance, crisis response, and making regional governance more effective in the security domain. Korea and Canada could also inaugurate regular ’2 x 2′ talks (foreign and defense ministers) along the lines of those recently established between Korea and Australia. These talks would also treat global security issues where Canada is well informed and engaged and where Korea seeks to increase its role. Our ideas for working together need not stop here. Our new relationship could also include specific areas of common interest such as nuclear safety, collaboration in the Arctic, and fostering technology and business tie-ups in promoting green growth (a Korean priority) and energy efficiency. Looking ahead, Korea and a Canada can continue to provide each other with ‘gateway’ partnerships — linking the dynamism of Korea and Asia with the strengths of Canada and North American business — that promote economic growth and prosperity for our citizens, build a safer world, and ensure a strong global economy with effective governance systems. This outcome is not assured. It will take major effort, renewed commitment and a readiness to make occasional compromises. And it has to start with the successful completion of a Free Trade Agreement. It’s that simple. Dr. Stephen Toope is the president and vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia, and Canadian co-chair of the Canada-Korea Forum.

1.0102626~Innovation evolution : the future of innovation at--and with--UBC~Toope, Stephen J.~INNOVATION EVOLUTION The Future of Innovation at—and with—UBC  The Vancouver Board of Trade Wednesday, September 11, 2013 Hyatt Regency Hotel—Regency Ballroom 655 Burrard Street 12 pm—2 pm    Thank you Murali, and my thanks to Elio Luongo and Janet Austin of the Vancouver Board of Trade, to today’s sponsors the Sauder School of Business and Odgers Berndtson, and to the Vancouver Board of Trade Women’s Leadership Circle. I want to take this opportunity to tell you what a genuine pleasure it has been to be welcomed by you all at the start of each new academic year. I will miss this tradition.  Writer Lillian Gershwin said, “People change all the time and forget to tell each other.” We do, don’t we? I’ve always thought of the time I spend with you as my chance to tell you how UBC has changed since we last spoke. To reintroduce you to one another. To offer that spark of an idea or story or image that will cause you to see the University of British Columbia with new eyes. I feel the need to    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 2 of 26  do that today more keenly than ever before, and beyond that, I want to expand and strengthen the pathways that connect what you do with what we do with what our community, our province, and our world need.  So, ladies and gentlemen: the University of British Columbia …. An innovation powerhouse, with the highest income from licensed IP of the top 10 universities in Canada. Highest number of patents applied for per year. Highest number of US patents issued per year. Second-highest number of licenses executed, of discoveries and inventions, and of start-ups per year. Over 150 spin-off companies so far and a partner in over a thousand industry-sponsored research projects. In fact, we conduct $500 million in research every year, which accounts for 25 percent of all research in BC, 94 percent of all industry-sponsored research in BC, and we contribute $12.7 billion annually to the provincial economy.  We’ve committed $150 million to sustainability infrastructure projects—more than any other university in the world—and have    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 3 of 26  turned our Vancouver campus into a living laboratory where buildings, energy systems, and classrooms are also experiments in sustainability. The results of those experiments, once transferred to the communities beyond our gates, hold the potential to influence the course of climate change on a massive scale.  We’re BC’s third largest employer, we graduated over 11,000 students last year, and just enrolled over 8,000 new ones from over 150 countries. Our 285,000 alumni form a worldwide network that has helped us raise $1.2 billion toward student scholarships and academic initiatives in our start an evolution campaign.  Not too shabby for a ‘medieval’ institution! And that’s what we are. Our roots lie in the 14th-century university model, a model grounded in service to the world through the conservation and creation of knowledge. But aside from the Latin motto above our very traditional-looking crest, you’d be hard-pressed to find evidence of those roots during a trip out to campus. Like every other institution around the globe, UBC has undergone a radical    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 4 of 26  transformation over the past twenty years, and ours has been both physical and operational. The drivers of that transformation include globalism and global competition, technological change, and economic upheaval as well as unprecedented student mobility, a radically altered work world, a shifting funding landscape, and the speed and necessity of constant innovation.  We’ve made our share of mistakes, and we’ve struggled with how to maneuver an occasionally unwieldy institution through the hairpin turns of the past two decades. Like all of our counterparts, we’ve grappled with how to hold to our core mission while maintaining a competitive edge in the new global education marketplace. After all, mission statements don’t mean much if you have to close your doors. But here we are, 136 years after Superintendent of Education John Jessup made his initial proposal for a provincial university, consistently ranked among the top 30 universities in the world, the top three in Canada, mission intact …. And we’re just getting warmed up.     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 5 of 26  I’m going to step outside the university gates for a moment now and hold up a snapshot of BC’s innovation ecosystem as a whole. The tech sector has transformed our economy. KPMG’s 2012 British Columbia Technology Report Card actually calls it a cornerstone. And you can’t argue with the numbers:  it employs 84,000 people, more than forestry, mining, oil and gas combined  it’s the third largest contributor to the GDP, up from number six a decade ago  it produced $18 billion in revenue last year, with a growth rate double that of BC’s overall growth  it accounts for 10 percent of all BC exports, or $4.1 billion, double what it was in 2001  it’s been the second-fastest private sector job creator over the past decade  and it provides $5.3 billion in wages, with employees earning 50 percent more than the BC average     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 6 of 26  Incredible stats, but here’s the sucker punch: BC ranks ninth among the provinces in productivity gains since 1985. As well, BC’s tech sector is proportionately smaller in terms of share of GDP, investment, and employment than Canada’s as a whole: 5.9 percent versus 7.5 percent.  BC Business Magazine released its annual “Top 100” list this July, ranking BC businesses by sector and revenues. They poured a bucket of cold water on the prevailing enthusiasm about our economy, noting that BC’s top 25 companies saw revenue drops last year, particularly in the resource and energy sectors. Our top 10 financial service companies brought in 25 percent less revenue this year compared with last year’s top 10, and mining, the golden child, dropped by nearly five percent. They cite our commodity-intense economy as the reason. With the Asian market our largest trading partner as of last year, we’re far more exposed than the rest of Canada to fluctuations in those economies.     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 7 of 26  Assuming wise stewardship, natural resources will always be foundational to BC’s economic strength and success. But it’s time we took the pressure off! Diversified our portfolio! It’s time we invested much more deliberately in the greatest resource we have: our innovative minds.  Just for fun … what would it look like if we closed the gap between 5.9 and 7.5 percent, the difference between the BC tech sector’s share of our economy and Canada’s national average?  Well, for starters, a $5.1 billion increase in industry revenue  a $2.5 billion increase in GDP  an additional 23,000 jobs  and a $1.4 billion increase in wages paid  Again, fantastic numbers. But how’s this for a surprise: the BC Technology Industry Association tells us that’s setting the bar too low. That’s letting the growth continue at its traditional rate for almost another decade, whereas the opportunity before us is    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 8 of 26  actually much bigger. BC stands to command a significant share of the technology market—if we take deliberate action now.  So … who’s ‘we’ and what action do we need to take? A report from C. D. Howe issued in June of this year names four key stakeholders in the future of the innovation economy: governments; the granting agencies; the business community; and the research universities.  Given that the majority of British Columbia’s R&D takes place in the private sector, as is true worldwide, just how key a player is UBC—or the other research universities, SFU, UVic, and UNBC? That comes down to where we innovate. Universities were the first to develop much of the medical, engineering, and computer technology in use today. As well, many scientific discoveries that come from basic (versus applied) university research find their way into new technologies, such as breakthroughs in biology that lead to new methods of genetic engineering, or advances in solid-state    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 9 of 26  physics that make it possible to design faster processors for computers.  Teaching hospitals connected to universities are the source of most new surgical procedures. And university research was the source of almost all of the building blocks of our information age, from the architecture of digital computers to the development of the underlying protocols of the Internet. Many of the firms that pioneered modern information technology were spin-offs of university research projects, and are responsible for much of the productivity growth we’ve experienced in North America in the past quarter century.  So if we can agree that UBC is a key player in BC’s innovation ecosystem, and if UBC really is the province’s post-secondary powerhouse that I described earlier, then why aren’t BC’s tech sector numbers reflecting it?     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 10 of 26  The C. D. Howe report shows that right now, each of the four stakeholders is actually weakening or limiting the pathways by which technology transfer happens. Technology transfer is the process by which university research contributes to technological progress and economic growth. Broadly speaking, technology transfer requires university expertise to provide the research, and industry expertise to do the development. But universities and industry aren’t the only players in the game; there are also the policy makers and funders. And Canada continues to rely on its universities to do development activities we are not designed—or best placed—to do. By maintaining this status quo, we risk compromising the quality of Canadian universities, the effectiveness of our tech transfer process, and ultimately our economic future. It’s going to take all four of us playing as a committed team to produce the kind of results we’re seeing in thriving tech hubs like San Diego’s CONNECT and London’s Tech City.     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 11 of 26  The C. D. Howe report makes these key recommendations designed to up Canada’s game. 1. Canadian businesses need to spend more on research and development in order to play their role in the technology transfer process as effectively as their American counterparts. 2. Granting agencies need to insist that all journal articles resulting from research they fund be made freely accessible to the public—and I’ll explain why in a moment. 3. Granting agencies also need to reallocate public funding to give more weight to overall academic excellence rather than immediate practical payoff. It seems completely counterintuitive, but the evidence shows that the greatest benefit to society and the economy comes from scientists for whom practical utility and individual financial reward are minor considerations. Canada’s granting agencies have been shifting funds away from curiosity-driven research and toward commercialization. And yet the most effective technology transfer comes out of academic environments that are    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 12 of 26  attractive to scientists who are driven primarily by the urge to advance knowledge in their field. 4. Canada’s National Research Council Institutes need to leave research to the universities, where the synergies between research and teaching can be most effectively exploited, and instead act as agencies that foster university/industry interactions. And … 5. University tech transfer offices need to focus more on fostering general interactions between business and faculty, and less on generating licensing revenue. This goes back to recommendation number three, about making journal articles accessible to the public. In a Carnegie-Mellon survey on industrial R&D, businesses were asked to name the most effective channel through which they benefitted from academic research. In most industries, the leading answers were publications, informal exchanges and communications with scientists, and consulting. Patents and licenses were hardly mentioned at all.     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 13 of 26  So … we’ve all got our work cut out for us. Let me share with you the progress we’ve made so far at UBC.  The three pathways by which we have traditionally transferred knowledge remain intact: 1) publications; 2) faculty experts acting as consultants; and 3) graduate students as ‘living knowledge transfers’ working in the field. However, we’re recognizing that we have to go beyond these. So we’ve developed an innovation strategy designed to maximize the societal and economic benefits that arise through the transfer of innovations coming out of UBC. It’s made up of five components:  First, we are opening a Corporate Relations office to better nurture and build our relationships with industry. Through it, we will be able to reach out proactively to individual business leaders and organizations, business associations, and think tanks. The office will also act as a concierge service for the business community in its interactions with UBC. We have heard you asking for this, and    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 14 of 26  we’re responding. We also invite your input on the specific services you’re looking for so we can be sure we’re meeting those needs.  Second: Faculty consulting is a simple, effective avenue by which businesses and other organizations can benefit from university expertise and help build connections. Historically, faculty experts have been left to manage consulting contracts themselves. Now, we’re looking at ways to take the administrative details off their plates so they can focus on delivering innovative solutions. We have been watching other universities globally opening agency offices for this purpose, and we will open our own version in the spring of 2014.  Third: I spoke earlier about UBC as a living laboratory. The sustainability systems and models we develop, from smart energy grids to zero-emissions buildings, will be directly exportable—and scalable—to the wider community, through industry partners and also through governments from civic to national. And the unique approach we’ve taken—of addressing operational requirements by    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 15 of 26  pairing industry innovation with our research expertise—is also applicable to a wide range of activities beyond sustainability.  Fourth: A key focus of our activities is entrepreneurship, and we have entirely redesigned our e@UBC program. It’s now a full continuum consisting of education, workshops, venture creation, and seed funding. Alumni are contributing time and expertise as mentors and Executives in Residence. The methodologies taught at Sauder match those applied in the venture creation workshops, and all content will be available online, which ensures broad-based access and scalability. In our pilot earlier this year, of the 14 teams that undertook the eight-week process, seven are launching real-world companies. To cap our e@UBC component, Sauder is now offering a university-wide Entrepreneurship 101 class, which launched last week. The course is already oversubscribed and contains students from 14 different faculties and schools. We’re excited to further strengthen the program and augment the seed fund to support the innovation that’s emerging out of our student population and our young graduates.    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 16 of 26   And fifth, all of these activities will be supported by UBC’s University Industry Liaison Office. Our UILO is one of the most successful tech transfer offices in Canada. That said, it was designed primarily for the commercialization of medical discoveries. So we’re reengineering it so that it can serve all elements of our innovation strategy, increase our ability to mobilize knowledge, accelerate and streamline the licensing process for all types of discoveries, and steward sponsored research contracts effectively for everyone involved.  I’m sure I sound like a proud parent … which is why I’m going to turn things over to some other people for a few minutes. Nitin Kawale, president of Cisco Canada, formed a partnership with UBC this spring that will undertake a number of energy-focused initiatives over the next five years. Kawale says, “The work done … on campus will enable vital energy-saving solutions for the university, and [will] also serve as a roadmap for future smart    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 17 of 26  energy and smart community initiatives not only in Canada but around the world.”  FortisBC pledged $300,000 over the next three years to the Master of Engineering in Clean Energy to support student co-op placement in industry. Doug Stout, Vice President of Energy Solutions and External Relations for Fortis, says, “We’ve heard the call from universities to industry to provide opportunities for skilled workers, and we look forward to seeing these students apply their training to achieve sustainable energy solutions.”  Dr. Vit Gunka with BC Women’s Hospital has partnered with researchers from UBC’s Electrical and Computer Engineering team to develop an ultrasound-guided method of epidural needle insertion during childbirth. He says, “This … method promises to improve the safety of patient care and to accelerate learning of medical [trainees]. Working together [with UBC] stimulates us to generate fresh ideas and develop novel approaches that link    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 18 of 26  recent technological advances with improvements in health care delivery.”  Mongolia has been making headlines as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Last year, UBC signed an agreement with Mongolia’s Ministry of Education, Culture and Science aimed at promoting best practices in mining. It includes an exchange program with two years of study at a Mongolian university and two years at UBC, resulting in a Bachelor of Applied Science degree. Mongolian national and PhD student Zorig Davaanyam says that degree programs in Mongolia focus more on academics and less on practical applications than western programs. “Without industry connections,” he says, “Mongolian students miss out on the invaluable applied learning that programs like [this one] provide[s].”  Dr. Larry Goldenberg, founding director of the Vancouver Prostate Centre at VGH, says, “The holy grail of cancer research is the ability to not only detect cancer at its earliest stages, but to be able    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 19 of 26  to predict its natural behavior in a particular individual.” Goldenberg is partnering with Electrical and Computer Engineering researchers and the BC Cancer Agency to develop a system of vibro-elastography that detects stiffness in body tissues that may indicate the presence of a tumour. So far, it has been tested for use with liver, prostate and breast cancers. Goldenberg says, “This very exciting collaborative research has already borne fruit as it has progressed from the laboratory to human testing.”  Earlier this year, Boeing became the founding industrial member of UBC’s Composites Research Network. The Network includes a node on our UBC Okanagan campus as part of our “innovation in the Interior” initiative, and one of the corporate partners is Kelowna’s own FormaShape. William Lyons, director of Global Technology at Boeing Research & Technology, says, “This collaboration has the potential to generate new applications of composite processing technology not only within Canada’s aerospace industry, but [also] in other fields such as the automotive and resources sectors.”    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 20 of 26   What could it look like? BC’s innovation ecosystem, I mean. If we all chose to adopt those C. D. Howe Report recommendations and committed ourselves to a thriving tech sector economy. The thing is, we’re so close. All the pieces are in place. It’s the commitment we need now, the common goal, the shared vision.  I want to leave you with one last picture. Now, in order to see this picture I’m going to need you to put on a special pair of glasses. Nope, not Google Glass. Those won’t be available until 2014, and besides, they’re $1,500 a pop. No, these are by Recon Instruments, a small 2008 startup founded by four UBC Sauder and engineering grads. They sold their first pair in 2010 and have since moved more than 40,000 units of their ReconSkis and ReconJets for cyclists. They’re $599 a pair, but these are a gift. Please, I insist. Now put them on … don’t worry, you’ll still look cool. They’re made for athletes. Any second now, they’ll baseline your heart rate and elevation. Let’s head outside. I want to take you up to campus. Road bike, motorbike, your choice. Your    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 21 of 26  ReconJets are tracking your heart rate, cadence, speed and distance. Hands free, you synch them with your smartphone, call your business partner back at the office to gloat, upload photos and video of the Burrard Bridge, West 4th Avenue, and Jericho Beach as you speed by. After using Buddy Tracking to check in with the rest of the group, you use the nav system to set the last leg of your route, call up your favourite playlist, and ride.  You cross Blanca and speed down Chancellor Boulevard, Pacific Ocean on your right and ancient spruce and cedar and fir trees all around you. You notice that something feels different here. You pull over and ask a jogger on the trail beside you where you are and she says, Welcome to the living laboratory. You continue your tour, and notice that this living lab is ringed by residences that are occupied by students, staff, and faculty from all over the world. You’re passed by a péloton of cyclists racing to their next class. You spot the bike racks—everywhere, it seems—and the electric plant ops vehicles, and the building that creates more energy than it uses. All part of the laboratory. You spot steam emerging from a    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 22 of 26  grate in the ground and stop a studious-looking fellow to inquire. We heat the whole campus with steam, he tells you, but we’re switching to hot water heating. More efficient, less waste. It’s part of the Smart Grid project. You nod encouragingly. He seems mesmerized by your glasses. We’re expanding too fast for our current electrical system. We need more energy, and we need to produce less waste. The Smart Grid will optimize electricity use in every building, and recycle unused energy back into the system. It sounds too good to be true, but then, you’re the one wearing the magic spectacles.  You step into the green building, slide into a rear seat in a darkened lecture hall, and find yourself in a class the likes of which didn’t even exist when you were a student. Civil Engineering Professor Don Mavinic is altering the phosphorus balance of waste water to produce pellets that can be used as fertilizer in soils. Forestry prof Stavros Avramidis is using radio technology—the same thing that powers the AM/FM radio in your Recons—to decontaminate wood. UBC Fisheries Centre’s Amanda Vincent    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 23 of 26  and her team are collaborating with the world’s top nature photographers to focus the public’s attention on the ocean’s the coral reefs. And geologist Michael Hitch is fixing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide in mine waste rock, claiming that some large mines could fix five million tonnes or more a year. I don’t like waste, you hear him say, before you duck back out the door. No kidding.  Two students dressed in business suits and dress shoes—clearly from Sauder—walk toward you, alternately texting and checking out your Recons. You preen a little, flattered, until *ping!* you realize they’ve actually hacked your email and sent you a message. A team of senior Sauder and engineering students has claimed victory at the national Pacific Venture Capital Competition, the message reads, for VenAir, a Ventilated Door. The door allows air to continually flow between rooms while remaining closed and blocking sound. Second place was awarded to another UBC team for SoundIT, a mobile application that lets customers select their own songs at their favourite bars. You quickly search for SoundIT    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 24 of 26  and download it to your Recons before reading the last part of the message: Three Sauder MBA students have established the Surrey Rent Bank, an organization that provides microloans to people facing eviction. At the latest count, the Bank has processed 28 applications and kept 26 individuals and families in their homes.   You’re back on your bike now, navigating your way to University Boulevard, when a man in a white lab coat runs into the street and waves you down—not usually a good sign. I’m late, he says, and hops on the back of your bike without further explanation. Vancouver General, pronto!  You’re at the hospital within 10 minutes, but instead of waving goodbye, he invites you in. He shows you how CT film images, often in the thousands for a single individual, are being converted from film to digital, allowing practitioners to sort them and navigate to a specific site in a patient’s body with a click of the mouse. How automated ultrasound imaging of liver, prostate, and breast tissue takes less than a minute now instead of half an hour; how it can be    Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 25 of 26  done by technicians now instead of physicians; how it’s providing a clearer basis for cancer patient outcome analysis; how it’s become the standard of care for the BC Cancer Agency, the Vancouver Cancer Centre, and throughout BC. He takes you to view a surgery where ultrasound-guided robots manipulating surgical tools inside the patient are in fact copying the motions of the surgeon’s hands outside the patient. Total accuracy, no tremor, and a superb, highly magnified stereo camera view. You’re impressed. He’s impressed with your glasses. You shake hands, and now you’re headed back downtown.  Broadway to Burrard, over the bridge, you lock up your bike, head back to your table in the Hyatt Regency Ballroom … and you’re just about to switch off your Recons radio when you hear this announcement: UBC scientists have created a computer processor that’s just as easy to program as current processors but runs 10 to a thousand times faster. You slide back into your seat, dazed, and wondering if your new Recons are already obsolete.     Vancouver Board of Trade Stephen J. Toope Page 26 of 26  [pause]  Welcome back. I called my presentation today “The Future of Innovation” but what I just described is the present of innovation at UBC. It’s already here. The future will be created out of what we decide to do collectively after lunch. At UBC, we want to be an active participant in an innovation ecosystem that’s fast, fluid, streamlined, and effective, every part operating according to its strengths and purpose, and the results—for our economy and for society as a whole—so much greater than the sum of those parts. UBC’s innovation strategy will allow us to do our part. I invite you now to work with me and my team, to help get the innovations I described today, and others like them, to market, and to make way for more. Because right now UBC is innovating faster than BC’s tech transfer process can keep up with. But together, we can change that. We must. Thank you. -30- 
1.0102628~Create 2013~Toope, Stephen J.~CREATE 2013 September 3, 2013 Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor The University of British Columbia  Hi.   It’s so great to meet you.  This moment is unique for me. Every September, I stand on this stage and speak to UBC’s newest students, imagining as I do what we will create together over the next four or more years, how UBC will change, how you and I will change, and knowing as I speak that we will all come together again, one final time, for your graduation.  But this year is different. This year, your first at UBC, is my last. So this moment is particularly poignant for me. This is the only moment in time that all of us will share. And I’m going to ask for your help with something: Help me make this moment count.    Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 2 It’s become a cliché, hasn’t it, “making the moment count,” because we want to believe we’re going to do it, but we’re pretty sure we won’t. Between TV, computer gaming, and Google searching alone, we’ll waste countless moments throughout our lives. We’re pretty good at making the most of the “big moments” when they come along—first day of university, the big game, the big exam, the big date, graduation—but we so easily lose sight of how precious the small ones are. I want to use this moment we have together to give you a way to remember.  So … are you ready? ARE YOU READY?  My senior advisor warned me not to use the Latin, not on the first day. But I’ve got the outfit and I’ve got the microphone and I’m going to use the Latin. I told him I think you can handle the Latin. Can you handle the Latin? CAN YOU HANDLE THE LATIN?  [silence]    Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 3  Memento mori. [pause] “Remember that you will die.”  That’s it. [pause] That’s my secret. And believe me when I say that the older you get, the easier it is to remember! But this idea is making its way into the collective consciousness of every generation. I’ve seen a Lululemon bag, of all things, that says, “Visualize your eventual demise. It can have an amazing effect on how you live in this moment.”   And that’s the point, of course: not just to remember you’re going to die, but to remember to live! Fully. Completely. Authentically. In other words, yes, if you fulfill all your course requirements, you’ll graduate. But what do you want the years and months and moments between now and then to feel like? What new version of yourself do you want to be when you get there?  Who here knows what a bucket list is? [hands; pause] Okay, and who here has a bucket list? [reaction] A bucket list is a list of the all   Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 4 things you want to do before you kick the bucket. For example: “I must remember to add skydiving to my bucket list.” Having a bucket list helps you carpe diem. That’s Latin for “seize the day.” The bucket list keeps you focused on what’s most important to you.  I have two bucket lists. I know, I know … you’re thinking, “Of course he has bucket lists. He’s old.”  It’s true. I’m one of the lucky ones. Not everybody gets to get old. Think about that. So I have two lists: one for my final year at UBC that includes making sure UBC is a leader in flexible learning, as well as finally taking that walk on Wreck Beach. [pause] Fully dressed. [pause] In winter. I have a second list for the life I envision for myself after I leave UBC, and that one includes making a new contribution in the field of international human rights law, where my heart lies.  One for UBC; one for after UBC. The items on your list don’t have to be huge. In fact, sometimes minima maxima sunt. Latin: the smallest things are the most important.     Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 5 The only requirement is that the author be you—not your friends, not your family, not your professors. Your lists won’t look like anyone else’s. And that’s the way it should be.   Don’t put off writing them. Tempis fugit. Latin again, for “time flies.” These years at UBC may be the most political, heightened, charged time of your life. There is a special energy belonging only to this time that will accelerate you through an almost vertical learning curve, dismantle most if not all of your old belief systems, and transform you radically, forging you into a more awake, more aware, more capable version of yourself. Your relationships will change and some will end. You will travel, perhaps across the globe, perhaps to deeper levels of your own consciousness. Your vocabulary will change. You will speak new languages. You will invent, create, perform, compete, collaborate, discover, and contribute of yourself in ways you cannot even imagine in this moment. But what you can do right now is say yes. Invite it all in. Though there will be days when it doesn’t seem so, this time is   Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 6 short, and it will never come again. The university is the universe made tangible for a brief and wondrous time in your lives.    And the very best thing about it? Tu um est. Yep, Latin. It’s UBC’s motto, and it means, “It’s yours.” It also means, “It’s up to you.” This place, these people you’re traveling with, these years, this time in which you live … it’s yours, and what you make of it, and of yourself, is up to you.  Memento mori. Tempis fugit, carpe diem, minima maxima sunt.  Remember that your time here is short, and make every moment count. Time flies, so seize the day—not tomorrow but this day—and do what you came here to do. Don’t judge the inspirations as they come; sometimes the smallest-seeming things lead to the greatest learnings, the biggest discoveries, the highest contributions. These years at UBC are yours; this life is yours. Tu um est.   Create 2013   Professor Stephen J. Toope   Page 7  Welcome to UBC.  -30-

Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 4  Abstract  Education, innovation and knowledge are key drivers in the world economy. Led by China and India, the emerging economies of Asia have placed a premium on investing in higher education and on building academic and research links around the globe. Canada must do the same, embracing an international education strategy that recognizes the importance of education as a way of deepening our relationships with Asian countries. Canada must brand itself as a partner of choice in higher education and research, and recruit Asian students and researchers to come here to study. At the same time, we must invest more in study and work-abroad programs for Canadian students, and must be deliberate about fostering academic collaboration with Asia through joint academic programs, joint supervision of PhD students, and faculty mobility. We need to find new ways to export our expertise in higher education and leverage our alumni networks, making Canadian expatriates and former international students ambassadors for Canadian higher education. The personal connections made by Canadians who study in other countries, and by foreign students in Canada, can result in long-term economic, social and cultural ties. The private sector can play a leadership role in this process by providing internships and funding for student mobility. Canada?s universities are often at the forefront of engagement with developing economies. As such, they are an asset that both government and the private sector can work with to advance our country?s place in the world.          Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 5  R?sum?  L?avenir du Canada et celui des pays du monde sera fa?onn? par un nombre croissant de citoyens du monde cr?atifs, hautement qualifi?s, instruits et ambitieux. Dans un monde d connect? et interreli?, les liens interpersonnels sont essentiels, car Ils contribueront ? ?tablir des liens ?conomiques, sociaux et culturels forts et durables entre les pays. Alors que le monde continue d??prouver des difficult?s ?conomiques, il deviendra de plus en plus important de bien comprendre ses voisins internationaux.  La croissance des ?conomies asiatiques pr?sente une belle occasion pour le Canada. Pour la saisir, la Canada doit ?laborer une strat?gie d??ducation internationale qui reconna?t l?importance de l??ducation comme moyen d?approfondir nos relations avec les pays d?Asie. Le Canada doit se d?marquer comme partenaire de choix en ?ducation sup?rieure et en recherche avanc?e et recruter des ?tudiants et chercheurs asiatiques ? venir ?tudier ici. Nous devons aussi investir davantage dans des programmes d??tude et de travail ? l??tranger et chercher d?lib?r?ment ? d?velopper une collaboration entre le milieu universitaire de l?Asie en concevant des programmes conjoints, en supervisant conjointement des ?tudiants au doctorat et en favorisant la mobilit? des enseignants. Les programmes d??ducation canadiens doivent ?tre adapt?s pour aider les ?tudiants ? approfondir leurs connaissances et leur compr?hension de l?histoire, des cultures et des langues asiatiques. Nous devrons compter sur le leadership du secteur priv?, sous forme d?internats et de financement de la mobilit? des ?tudiants. Gr?ce ? son ?conomie relativement forte, le Canada a l?occasion d?investir dans la collaboration internationale en mati?re de recherche qui apportera des avantages pour les ann?es ? venir.  Le Canada devrait trouver d?autres moyens d?exporter notre expertise en ?ducation sup?rieure et de mettre en valeur nos r?seaux de ressources existantes, faisant des expatri?s canadiens et des anciens ?tudiants internationaux des ambassadeurs de l??ducation sup?rieure canadienne. Les universit?s canadiennes sont souvent ? l?avant-garde de l?engagement avec les ?conomies en d?veloppement et elles servent d?important partenaire du gouvernement et du secteur priv? en assurant la prosp?rit? ?conomique et sociale ? l?avenir.        Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 6  Introduction  A university education is a transformative experience. Universities help us navigate in a profoundly changing and challenging world. They create, connect and integrate knowledge. They link us across cultures and across borders.  Universities also transform countries. This fact is nowhere more evident than in Asia. Led by India and China, in recent years Asia has been taking an increasingly dominant role in the global economy. Rapid growth is affecting all aspects of the region?s economy and society, with changes closely influenced by demographic trends such as large cohorts of young people and an expanding middle class. Demand for higher education in Asia has been rising steadily in response to these trends and to the labour market needs of today?s knowledge-intensive economy.  For Canada to prosper and compete in the global economy, we need to take advantage of the many opportunities Asia?s prosperity and growth will bring. Canada?s future ? indeed, the future of countries around the world  ? will be shaped, from within our borders and outside of them, by changes wrought by a growing population of creative, highly trained, well-educated and ambitious global citizens. The emerging leaders of the 21st century global economy have placed a premium on investing in higher education and in building academic and research links around the globe.  Canada must do the same. Unprecedented demand for higher education in Asia today offers a multitude of opportunities for Canada, from institutional partnerships to facilitate research, to the recruitment of talented international students and researchers, to new markets for Canadian knowledge exports.   The government of Canada recognizes that education, innovation and knowledge are key drivers in a world economy. In its 2011 budget, the federal government announced the development of a new Canadian International Education Strategy.  In October of the same year, it named an expert advisory panel, which is about to release a report with recommendations aimed at deepening educational and research links between Canada and international institutions. The government confirmed its commitment to establishing a strong and coherent international education strategy in its 2012 budget, when it said, ?Attracting more international   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 7  students and researchers to Canada will create jobs and economic growth, expand our people-to-people ties in priority markets, showcase Canadian research excellence abroad, help produce a more skilled workforce and foster closer ties between Canadian and international educational institutions.?1     I believe firmly that the people-to-people connections we are building through institutional cooperation and academic mobility lead to strong and sustainable economic, social and cultural ties. Canada must make significant investments to foster and maintain these personal linkages, leveraging the ongoing efforts by our universities and encouraging the participation of new stakeholders in international education. The intercultural knowledge, skills and networks that are built in this sector are essential for individuals and businesses to thrive in today?s global economy. The personal connections made by Canadians who study in other countries, and by foreign students in Canada, can result in long-term economic, social and cultural ties. Given this reality, there is a clear opportunity ? and incentive ? for greater private sector involvement.  Top 10 Steps to position Canada as the education destination and partner of choice for Asia   1. A cohesive international education strategy  The international education sector, like many others in Canada, is complex and multifaceted. There are numerous government and non-governmental players and each has a complementary role in the development and implementation of a truly effective national strategy. This strategy should reflect the centrality of international education to Canada?s future prosperity and quality of life.  Education must become a pillar of Canada?s foreign policy and economic growth objectives. Senior leadership engagement ? in both the public and private sectors ? is essential to demonstrate to Asian partners that Canada?s commitment to international education is strong and sustainable. The federal government can act as an enabler and facilitator, opening new doors for research and mobility partnerships between Canadian and Asian institutions.     Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 8    In the case of China, university enrolment has been rising at a staggering rate since the 1990s, particularly over the past decade. Between 2000 and 2010, graduate student enrolment alone grew from 283,000 to 1.5 million, while total enrolment in higher education reached 22.3 million by the same year.2  It is critically important that the international education strategy be led by the education community. Education groups, including universities, colleges, schools and language schools, are already making inroads in a cohesive, pan-Canadian approach to international education.  It is also important to make sure the strategy is robust and at scale. To date, Canada has been limited in fully leveraging Canadian universities? international linkages for three reasons:  ? Previous government initiatives have been episodic and sporadic, and were often the focus of cuts at the first sign of a downturn; ? Our efforts are diffuse ? institutional, provincial and federal initiatives have not worked together effectively to advance Canada?s interests; and finally, ? We have trouble getting to scale ? there have been many pilot programs that demonstrate excellent value but that never achieve the scale necessary to generate truly transformative results.  Diplomacy in the 21st century goes far beyond interactions between government actors. Higher education institutions, private industry and civil society all make invaluable contributions to the development of enduring people-to-people ties. A national, collaborative approach to international education is needed to leverage investments made by all stakeholders and to align activities with a series of common goals.   2. Build the Canadian brand  Countries long established in the international education market, such as the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, have strong brands and communicate them effectively.    Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 9   To make an impact, Canada must firmly, intentionally and creatively position the Canadian university community in Asia to succeed as both a destination for talented students and researchers, and a vital partner at the institutional level. Asian countries have rapid-growth economies and rapidly changing higher education landscapes ? factors that can pose challenges to individual universities in terms of navigating the system, identifying ideal partners and tracking ongoing market developments.  Key to the success of Canada?s international education will be the strong branding of quality Canadian education, and a collaborative approach to marketing the excellence of Canadian higher education. Canada offers an education experience that is of excellent quality, affordable and provided in a safe and welcoming environment.    We must make targeted investments now to build this brand of excellence in countries of strategic priority, such as India and China. We must also present a united front to the world.  The federal and provincial governments, the private sector, and the education sector must work together at scale to brand Canada as a partner of choice in higher education and research.  3. Targeted recruitment of Asian students and researchers  Canada has a window of opportunity to establish itself as a premier destination for students at all levels, especially in the key target markets of China and India. Competitors such as Australia and the United Kingdom are facing policy challenges that are expected to reduce demand from international students. We must act quickly to strengthen Canada?s position as an ideal destination for the most talented students and researchers.  Asia is already the largest source of international students in the world, and the number of Asians looking to study abroad is expected to continue to rise in the coming years. In the case of Canadian universities, half of our top 10 source countries for international students are in Asia.      Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 10   China has been Canada?s top source country for international students for many years, representing close to one-quarter of international undergraduate and graduate students in Canada in 2009 with 23,400 students (19,100 full-time and 4,300 part-time students). Other key Asian markets include India (four percent), South Korean (four percent), Japan (two percent) and Hong Kong (two percent). With sustained effort and clear intention, Canada has begun to make progress in India, and we have seen an increase in the number of students coming to Canada from India. India is now the sixth ranked source country for full-time international students on Canadian university campuses.3  Competition for global talent is intensifying alongside the growth in mobility of Asian students ? especially at the graduate level. While Canada?s universities have been increasingly successful in recruiting international students ? more than doubling in number in the past decade ? targeted and sustained investments are required to attract top talent to our campuses.4  The Canadian government recently introduced the high-profile Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships and Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships to attract and retain world-class Canadian and international talent, and to position Canada as a global centre of excellence in research and higher learning. In announcing the winners of these scholarships last year, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called them ?a key source of entrepreneurial innovation and creativity.?5 A modest number of other scholarships are also offered by the government to attract non-Canadian students to Canada.  Beyond these programs, individual institutions are already investing significantly in recruitment efforts, including allocations to scholarship programs for international students. These initiatives have established a strong foundation that now needs to be strengthened and brought to scale in order to meet Canada?s ambitions in the world.  More can be done, however, to put Canadian higher education on the map and attract top-notch international talent.  A high profile, Canada-branded scholarship program is needed to attract top quality students and researchers. This would include scholarships for undergraduates, and could also see significant ramping up of the Vanier graduate   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 11  scholarships. Canada?s scholarship program should be built upon strategic partnerships between key Canadian stakeholders, including governments, private industry and higher education institutions.  4. Two-way short term mobility  Our future, increasingly, is shaped by global, quickly moving and interconnected forces. To understand these challenges, Canada needs people with knowledge of other countries, languages, and cultures, and an ability to establish partnerships with colleagues from around the world. Canadian universities continue to recognize the importance of creating meaningful international learning experiences for their students. These experiences help students to develop inter-cultural skills and prepare graduates for success in today?s knowledge-based economy. We are committed to enhancing the learning experience of undergraduate, graduate and professional students by drawing on a full range of educational, research-based and community-focussed opportunities enriched with global engagement and new technologies.  Although we know that Canadian university students are interested in a wide range of international mobility opportunities, fewer than three percent gain international study experience for credit in a given year. Financial considerations are often cited as the most significant hindrance to participation in international academic exchanges, research collaboration and internships.  Our partners outside Canada are concerned about the paucity of Canadians studying in other countries.  The imbalance is seen as representing a lack of commitment by Canada to true partnership and evidence of provincialism ? not ideas that a robust internationally engaged Canada would want to foster.  While financial barriers are not unique to Canadian students, many other countries address this challenge by investing in study-abroad programs. For example, Germany has made significant investments in student mobility, including the equivalent of more than $36 million euros in funding for study-abroad scholarships in 2010 alone.6 A recent survey revealed the impact of these funds: close to a third of all German university students go abroad for part of their studies.7    Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 12   I have seen first-hand the benefits of study abroad in my own life and that of my family. A pan-Canadian international student mobility program, with funding from both the government of Canada and the private sector, can help students gain the international experience essential for their ability to contribute to the global economy.  This program should include opportunities for both short-term and long-term study, work and research abroad. Private sector involvement will be key to providing students with hands-on experiences through internships or similar opportunities.  5. Develop key institutional partnerships  Institutional partnerships create a solid foundation for all aspects of international education, including student and faculty mobility, research collaboration, and joint academic programs. The most successful relationships involve a balanced equilibrium in power and effort ? a general rule that holds true in this field. We must help Canada to stand apart from its competitors by creating a model that highlights our unique strengths as a partner in international education, not simply as a recruiter.  Canadian universities are committed to cultivating meaningful engagement and partnerships, both at home and abroad. We develop bilateral agreements with other academic institutions to create new opportunities for our students to gain international study and research experience. We invite partnerships with businesses to combine our resources in order to research and implement solutions to local and global problems.   Mitacs, a national, not-for-profit research organization, offers innovative research and training programs. Leveraging collaboration among government, academia and private industry, these programs allow top students and researchers from around the world to develop high-quality research expertise in Canada.    Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 13  Canada must be deliberate about building academic collaboration with Asia1, rather than relying solely on our traditional partners such as Europe or the United States.  This collaboration can include the development of joint academic programs (i.e. joint or double degrees), joint supervision of PhD students (i.e. co-tutelles), faculty mobility, capacity-building of faculty and university administrators, and the development of innovative approaches to ensuring both Canadian and Asian students benefit from a globally enhanced learning experience during their academic career.     The mobility of faculty plays a key role in bringing together students, institutions, and researchers. Often, faculty members are the drivers of specific academic collaborations that grow into institution-wide, long-term partnerships between universities. Developing joint academic programming, introducing innovative learning practices that flow across borders, and using ICT to facilitate collaboration are all key to ensuring that Canada builds knowledge links today that we need for our future.  6. Internationalize curricula in Canada  Ideally, all Canadian students and faculty would gain first-hand international experience through academic exchanges, research placements or internships. As we build towards this objective, Canadian universities are also pursuing other avenues to internationalize our institutions and offer globally enriched learning experiences on campus. The internationalization of curricula is one example of these efforts, which involves the inclusion of intercultural and global dimensions in course content and teaching methods. Key strategies to integrate international elements into curricula include involving international scholars and visiting experts; encouraging incoming international student mobility opportunities; using international or intercultural case studies; and developing joint programs with international partners.                                                             Toope, Stephen J., Tan, Chorh Chuan, Fedoroff, Nina V., Improving Asia-Pacific Science Collaboration, Science 366 (2012): p. 38-39   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 14   More than 80 different programs related to Asian studies are offered at universities across Canada, including coursework related to Asian cultures, literature, languages and public policy.8   There is a particular need to incorporate more Asian content into Canadian educational programs, from kindergarten to university. To prepare graduates to work in the global workforce ? one increasingly shaped by Asian economies ? young Canadians must have greater exposure to the histories and cultures of Asian countries. A strong emphasis should be placed upon the development of Asian language study programs. Canadian students also need to know much more about how Asia Pacific researchers are changing the dynamics of science around the globe, a trend I wrote about earlier this year in Science.  7. Leadership from the private sector  Universities are committed to reaching beyond their own institutions to create alliances, partnerships and initiatives of shared purpose. On the international education front, business leaders can make a key difference in ramping up international education commitments, making them meaningful and ensuring success. Take, for example, Brazil?s Science without Borders program. This initiative will enable 101,000 Brazilian university students and scholars to study and conduct research abroad over the next four years. The Brazilian government is funding 75,000 Brazilian students. The Brazilian private sector has stepped up to fund an additional 26,000 scholarships.9 This innovative program will strengthen and expand innovation and competitiveness through the international mobility of undergraduate and graduate students and researchers.  During a recent mission to Brazil of 30 Canadian university presidents, organized by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and led by the Governor General, it was announced that Brazil will send up to 12,000 of these students to Canada.10 Canadian business leaders are now stepping up to ensure that these students receive an integrated experience while in Canada, including not only language and postsecondary study, but also hands-on internships in private industry.   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 15   Groups such as the Canadian Council of Chief Executives and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce can play a leadership role by raising awareness of the importance of study- and work-abroad experiences for Canadians ? and they can join the effort to secure funding to make these opportunities a reality for many more young Canadians.  8. Invest in international research collaboration at scale  Today?s knowledge environment is global. Talent comes from everywhere. The world?s best minds must be concentrated on the world?s toughest problems to create, communicate and apply new knowledge to effect tangible, positive change in the world. Like the strongest economies, the top students and researchers are globally engaged and mobile.  Research is a primary driver for Canada and we thrive by providing a supportive environment for talent. Universities, aided by federal and provincial governments, have worked to create the conditions that attract talent from around the world, and that keep talented Canadians here, enabling them to do their best work at home. All of Canada participates in and benefits from this enterprise, which requires not only advanced research facilities but also lively, safe, diverse and inclusive communities that serve as magnets for people who could choose do their work anywhere on earth.  Given the comparative strength of the Canadian economy, we have an opportunity to invest in international research collaboration that will pay dividends for decades to come. Asia?s science and technology environment is also a potential source of stimulus for Canada?s own research sector and economic competitiveness. Countries such as Singapore and Japan have well-established research and development programs, while countries such as China and India continue to build their domestic capacity.  Countries around the world, including emerging nations, are making significant investments in research and development.  China?s investment has risen dramatically, to $154.1 billion USD in 2009.11 China awarded 48,700 doctorate   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 16  degrees in 200912 (compared to Canada?s 5,700).13 In 2009, China overtook Japan as the world?s second-largest investor in R&D after the United States.    India is building a National Knowledge Network that will see a $20-billion USD investment in cross-country broadband infrastructure to connect education institutions and research centres, with the goal of democratizing information.14  Regardless of location, Canadian universities are well-positioned to tap into collaborative research networks with their Asian counterparts. Although many institutions are already actively engaged in these types of partnerships, additional investments are needed to sustain and accelerate the pace of research to address highly complex issues. Given opportunities for commercialization, research is an ideal area for joint investments by the public and private sectors. A significant global research fund, at the federal level and awarded competitively through the granting councils, would enable international research collaboration at scale and would facilitate the participation of Canadian students and faculty in international research projects.  9. Knowledge exports  Rapid growth in Asia?s education sector has also created new opportunities for Canada to export its expertise in higher education. As many Asian countries strive to expand and sustain their higher education system, Canadian universities are well-positioned to collaborate in curriculum development, pedagogy, research and mentoring university administrations.  Canadian universities are not widely engaged in developing full offshore campuses. While these work well for some professional programs, they are generally less effective than building genuine partnerships. However, virtually all Canadian universities are engaged in pursuing knowledge export opportunities around the world.  These opportunities may include educational programs offered abroad (often through local host institutions), distance education programs, exporting Canadian curricula to partner institutions, franchising courses and programs, or providing education services abroad (specific courses, training, consulting, professional development programs, etc.).     Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 17  Some programs can be more easily offered abroad than others. Canadian business schools, for example, are leading the way into key markets. York University?s Schulich School of Business has been offering its MBA curriculum to Indian students through an Indian partner, with the students completing the program in Toronto, and is preparing to launch a full MBA program in Hyderabad as soon as India?s Parliament approves legislation granting foreign institutions the right to set up campuses and offer degrees.    My university?s Sauder School of Business, meanwhile, already offers more than 30 programs in China and Canada for senior government and business executives. To date, some 500 senior Chinese leaders from cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Fujian have taken part.15  Building on Canada?s reputation in the provision of high-quality higher education, we can create a strong knowledge-export industry to help Asian countries meet their need for post-secondary education.    10. Leverage international alumni networks  So often when I travel abroad, I meet alumni of Canadian universities who are eager to share with me the value of their education and experiences in this country. You will find them at the highest levels of government, running major corporations and small businesses, writing for newspapers, teaching young people or developing innovative products.  Today, we are reaping the benefits of shrewd investments made decades ago to bring international students to Canada. Transformed by their experiences in Canada, many international students return home after graduation and become leaders in their fields. The powerful and life-changing experiences they had while studying in Canada often leave a lasting impression on their career paths. Canadian university alumni become ambassadors for Canada, facilitating international partnerships and trade in both the public and private sectors. A concerted effort should be made to harness the potential for alumni to fulfill this role as ambassadors. Who better to speak to the Asian market than Asian voices about their experiences in Canada?     Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 18  During an AUCC-led visit by 15 Canadian university presidents to India in November 2010, a group of Indian alumni of Canadian universities launched the India-Canada Alumni Network (I-CAN).  This is a dedicated group of young professionals who have earned university degrees at Canadian institutions, and who have come together to share experiences and encourage younger students to consider Canada as a study destination. Through targeted alumni events in key Asian markets and the power of social media, Canada can build ever-stronger ties.   International higher education as a gateway to Asia  We must recognize that active engagement in international higher education acts as a gateway to closer bilateral and multilateral ties in all sectors. Given the concrete benefits that international students bring to Canada and the need for Canadian students to gain inter-cultural knowledge and skills to succeed in the global economy, it is clear that we must be intentional about engaging more broadly and deeply with powerful Asian economies.  We are past the point of relying on our traditional markets ? many of which are experiencing difficult and troubling economic setbacks.    Already, signs are encouraging. The government of Canada is increasingly recognizing the important role of higher education in what our Governor General, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, calls the ?diplomacy of knowledge.?  The government understands the value of academic links and collaboration in driving trade and building social, political and economic ties with the rapidly developing economies of Asia.  In 2010, the government of Canada and the government of India signed a Memorandum of Understanding on higher education cooperation.  In 2011, the Governor General led a mission of key academic and business leaders to Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia, with a strong focus on education, research and innovation.  In February 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited China, where he and President Hu Jintao announced that Canada and China will work to achieve the two-way exchange of 100,000 students within five years.16    Canadian universities attract some of the best minds from around the world. About 100,000 international students from across the globe are enrolled at Canadian universities, having chosen our country as the place to pursue academic   Strengthening education and research connectivity between Canada and Asia: Innovative models for engagement   Stephen Toope July 2012 19  excellence.17 We need the varied international perspectives these students bring to our university classrooms. Most importantly, their presence enriches the learning experience for all students and brings economic and social benefits to our campuses and broader communities. In addition, international students contributed $6.5 billion CAD to the Canadian economy in 2008 through spending on tuition, accommodation and other expenses. The positive economic impact of international education becomes particularly clear when compared to more traditional export goods, such as lumber ($5.1 billion CAD) and coal ($6.07 billion CAD).18   Many international students choose to remain in Canada after graduation, contributing valuable skills and expertise to our labour force. They have been encouraged by recent immigration policy changes that make it easier to gain work experience after graduation and transition to permanent residence. We also continue to gain benefits from those who return home, as they raise the profile of Canada as both a destination for high-quality education and an ideal partner for trade, investment and research collaboration.  Canada?s universities are often at the forefront of engagement with developing economies. As such, they are an asset that both government and the private sector can work with to advance our place in the world. By working together we can ensure that Canada?s economy and society will thrive and prosper.

1.0102631~2013 Fall Congregation~Toope, Stephen J.~1             2013 Fall Congregation     Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia           27-29 November 2013      2   Madam Chancellor, Distinguished colleagues; honoured guests; members of the UBC graduating class of 2013.  What a great day for you graduates.    Congratulations to each and every one of you.  On a day of graduation, it is inevitable that everyone present becomes especially conscious of time.   Parents and family are thinking about how only a few short years ago, you lot were in diapers, struggling to put a few words together.  Your professors are thinking that it was only yesterday that this class arrived at UBC -- how could the years go by so quickly?   You graduates may have a different sense of time.  Doctoral students may be relaxing for the first time in years.  Undergraduates may be thinking that they are a bit sad to leave this portion of their life behind; or they may be saying "I am sure glad that's over; I want to get on with my future."  No matter -- for all of us, in one way or another, time is at the forefront of our thoughts.  But like the Raven in many First Nations traditions, time is a trickster.  It catches you off-guard, surprising with it expansion and compression, its sudden hold on your throat.  "I can't believe that the paper is due tomorrow!"  "Is my baby really twenty-two years old?"  "Am I actually graduating today?"  For you graduates, I hope that you have experienced or will come to see your time at UBC as a precious interlude.  A time when much of the learning of generations of your ancestors has been laid out for you to 3  sample, to consider and to challenge;  A time of striking compression, when the stories of the natural world, and of humanity and its discoveries, have been crammed together for you to explore.  The next steps in your life may be quite different, except for those of you who are choosing to stay on for another degree.  For most of you who will go out into the working world, time will start to feel different, exciting in a very different way.  Reading and learning are connected to but fundamentally different from doing.  You may not be able to do until you have learned how to do, or at least how to learn to do.  But the actual doing can feel different, partly because of the way we experience time.  Consider these words of the wonderful Montreal-born essayist, Adam Gopnick:  What makes something interesting to read about is its narrative grip, and stories are, of necessity, exercises in compressing time.  What makes something interesting to do is that – through repetition, coordination, perseverance – it stretches time.1   I suspect that as you look back on it, your own story during your degree program was indeed about compressing time.  Semesters whirled by.  There was never enough time to do everything that you wanted to do.  Friends were graduating.  But now many of you are contemplating a very different existence, one without the formal book-ends of semesters and degrees.  You face a future that stretches on unknowably, where your work may last for months or                                                           1 Adam Gopnick, The New Yorker, 4 November 2013, "Bread and Women" 66, at 68. 4  years or decades – you won’t know.  That kind of time is different, because it will be a time in which you continually practice your skills, whatever they may be.  Canadian writer Malcom Gladwell recently popularized the 1940s management theory that, even with natural talent, it takes roughly 10,000 hours to truly master a skill.2  That sure stretches time!  Although mastering your craft, your profession, your business, your vocation can seem daunting as you contemplate those 10,000 hours, or whatever it takes, remember Adam Gopnick’s insight which is really encouraging.  If, as I hope, you have learned at UBC how to continue learning, your work – which will require repetition, coordination and perseverance – should be highly rewarding.  It will stretch time, and fill it with interest.  As we like to say at UBC, it’s up to you.  Keep reading, keep learning and compress time into the story of your life, one you can look back on with pride.  Contemporaneously, delve into your work, really practice what motivates you and become expert in whatever you choose to do.  Stretch time by creating fascination and depth in your own life.  We are proud of all you graduates.  Good luck.                                                             2 Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers: The Story of Success (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 2008) 
1.0108011~2014 Fall Congregation~Gupta, Arvind~Fall 2014 Congregation Speech What an honour it is for me to welcome all of you to celebrate UBC’s graduating Class of 2014.  Today is about the graduates and what you’ve achieved – through countless late night study sessions and dreaded 8:00 a.m. classes, sacrificing sleep, not to mention personal space just to get here on the B-line. This occasion is about what you’ve achieved through hard work, determination, and moments of creative inspiration. Page 1 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech Graduation is a time to imagine your future and the world to come. When you think of the road ahead, you may gain perspective by looking back to where you’ve been and even further back to understand the experience of previous generations.  I recognize that at this moment, you may be more preoccupied with looking forward than with reflecting on the past. And I don’t blame you. If you can believe it, I actually still remember what it was like to be a recent Page 2 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech graduate. I won’t say what year it was, but when I received my undergrad degree the unemployment rate was at 12%, the highest since the Great Depression.  Faced with this stark reality and a quickly dwindling bank account, I did the most logical thing I could think to do. I stayed in school.  Back then—and this is really dating me—a fax machine was considered high speed and Apple had just introduced the Macintosh Portable, a 17-pound laptop (imagine lugging that around Page 3 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech in your backpack!). We were just starting to send email and using something that eventually morphed into the World Wide Web. I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science, but I doubt any of us “experts” came even close to imagining how much the world would change because of the IT revolution. I think it’s safe to say the only constant in your life is change, and the rate of change will continue to accelerate as yesterday’s innovations become today’s museum pieces. Page 4 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech Just think of the advances in communication technologies that have occurred during your time at UBC. Some of you may have started here without a smart phone, but I’m willing to bet that most of you have one now.  You’ll probably update your status as soon as you leave here! Since you’ve been at UBC, Facebook has gone from millions of users to over a billion. And just when I figured out how to tweet, my daughters tell me that Twitter is “so yesterday” and that something called instagram or insta-Page 5 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech vine or snap-something is the next big thing. I can’t keep track but … for you it’s second nature – changing how you communicate and relate to each other is as natural as, well, as breathing. I have frequently called this the “empowered generation.” You quickly adapt to technology, access any information instantly and then debate and exchange ideas on a global level. The possibilities for sharing, innovating, and connecting across continents and cultures have Page 6 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech become limitless. You carry the sum of all human knowledge in your pocket and you have the opportunity to use this connectivity to better the world at a scale unlike any generation before you. Now I don’t mean to minimize the challenges you will meet and the obstacles you must navigate. Collectively we face climate change and sustainability. These are just two examples of unprecedented social issues that will require the entire databank of world knowledge Page 7 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech married to the creativity of humankind – to your creativity. The rapid change we are seeing also extends to job markets. Those who have the capacity to tolerate ambiguity, consider information systematically, and innovate are best placed to succeed in the jobs of today.  And if we’ve done it right, we’ve given you the gift of a great education. A UBC education goes beyond knowledge in a particular field, or training in a specific skill. A UBC education Page 8 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech cultivates critical thinking, nurtures creativity and inspires a global perspective.  A UBC education prepares students to succeed in the jobs of today and of tomorrow, jobs still unknown and even unknowable from our current perspective. We’ve given you the best tools we can for a lifetime of success. I’ll leave you with one last thought and a challenge. Being an expert is a noble pursuit, but adopting the role of lifelong learner is what will steer you through uncertain times. Take Page 9 of 10  Fall 2014 Congregation Speech today not as an occasion that marks an end to your learning, but as a beginning of a quest to learn more about yourself and about your world. UBC’s motto, Tu-um est, translated from Latin means “it is yours”. The education you got here is yours forever. And we hope to continue to engage with you as alumni as you travel forward to new adventures.   Congratulations, Class of 2014, and my very best wishes for you all. Page 10 of 10  
1.0107494~2011 Spring Congregation Address~Toope, Stephen J.~2011 Spring Congregation Address  Professor Stephen J. Toope President and Vice-Chancellor, The University of British Columbia  May 25 – June 1, 2011 Vancouver, British Columbia  Distinguished colleagues, honoured guests, members of the UBC graduating class of 2011. Well, here you are. You’ve made it to graduation day. Congratulations! While you graduates have been here at UBC, you have spent some time listening, like you are doing now: listening to lectures, listening to distinguished guest speakers, and to fellow students through the Terry Talks, and during class presentations. But I hope that you have spent even more time talking: discussing, debating, and challenging your professors and one another. If there is one thing that a good education demands, promotes, fosters, and tries to perfect, it is the intelligent and sensitive use of language. Two things happened this year that prompted me to think more seriously about language. First was a debate that arose over an article written in the New Yorker magazine by Malcolm Gladwell in which he argued that human ties created by social media are not strong enough to promote the solidarity required for social and political revolution. Second was an article published in Maclean’s magazine that tried to make the case that Canada’s two top universities – UBC and the University of Toronto – are facing a serious problem because our campuses are, as Maclean’s suggested provocatively, “too Asian”. These two events seem utterly disconnected, but they are not. Here’s why. Both controversies resulted from strong language masking sloppy thought, the sort of thing that I hope you graduates have been inoculated against. 2  More than three centuries ago, the great Enlightenment philosopher, John Locke warned that “[w]e should have a great fewer disputes in the world if words were taken for what they are, the signs of our ideas only, and not for things themselves.” i Locke was warning against the potential literalism of language, the belief that words are their own meaning; that they necessarily represent in themselves something true. In a remarkable collection called Voces, the Italian-Argentinean poet, Antonio Porchia offers this aphorism: “What words say does not last. The words last. Because words are always the same, and what they say is never the same.”ii Language is what we make of it, and we often make of it too little. We forget that language, what it represents, what it shapes in our thoughts, shifts with history, shifts with contexts, shifts with audience. This academic year, we saw two instructive examples of such shifts. I mentioned that the first example emerges from a debate prompted by Malcom Gladwell’s intentionally provocative assertion that the prophets of the new networked age vastly overstate the political importance of social networking.iii Gladwell argued specifically that the solidarity that underlay the American civil rights movement, the close personal ties that allowed activists to risk their safety and their lives for a cause, should not be analogized to the weak links formed through social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Gladwell writes: The platforms of social media are built around weak ties. Twitter is a way of following (or being followed by) people you have never met. 3  Facebook is a tool for efficiently managing your acquaintances… Social networks are effective at increasing participation – by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires.iv Gladwell is partly right. Social media activists claim too much in suggesting a causal role for their tools in fomenting social action. The idea promoted by some US journalists that Twitter was somehow responsible for the brief uprising in Iran last year is ridiculous. The tweets that these journalists followed so assiduously were all from outside Iran, mostly in the US, and they were in English, not Farsi. Even the current uprisings in large parts of the Arab world are at best facilitated by the new social networking tools. As you thoughtful university graduates will undoubtedly intuit, to understand cause requires some appreciation of national, pan-Arab and colonial histories; a sense of economic, social and cultural context; and a view on the audience who can access social media – typically younger, perhaps disaffected, maybe with limited hope in their economic future. But Gladwell is also guilty of loose thought and language. Because social media prophets use language that is too strong, he reacts similarly, suggesting that social networks are inevitably upholders of the status quo, that they can play no role in profound social change. The events of this past winter throughout the Middle East argue otherwise. True, social media did not create revolutionary moments in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere, but the ability to warn, to organize quickly, was relevant. That is why oppressive regimes throughout the world now routinely try to control, and sometimes even to shut down, the internet. As noted by social media commentator, Simon Mainwaring:  4  [T]he courage of protesters… using social media is important because of the infinitely scalable connectivity it enables. While Gladwell is right to assert that social media is largely used to exchange trivial information, it is a mistake to limit its transformative potential to the worst excesses of its current practice, denying that technology and the dynamics it enables will mature and grow along with its users, especially in dramatic circumstances such as the protests in Egypt. v Gladwell is guilty of ahistoricism because he implies that the close social ties of the Arab street are irrelevant to the new networked age; but why shouldn’t historically powerful networks of family and tribe be able to reposition their communications through the internet? Gladwell also fails to appreciate the changing context of a shifting age demographic in the Arab world, and evolving audiences whose sources of inspiration are transnational and not susceptible of governmental control. My second example of linguistic inexactitude is much less subtle. In its issue of November 10th, 2010, Maclean’s used strong language in its headline: “Too Asian?” vi The article contained an argument based almost entirely on anecdote, suggesting that lots of Caucasian students were choosing not to attend the University of Toronto and UBC because our campuses are filled with hyper-competitive students of Asian origin who make life hard for Caucasians who just want to have fun. The language used neglected history: the historic mistreatment of Asian immigrants in Canada, exemplified by the Chinese head tax and the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War. It 5  neglected context: the changing demographics of Canada, especially in the Lower Mainland of BC, where it is no surprise that a large percentage of UBC students have an Asian heritage. It neglected audience: I would expect that as a national newsmagazine like Maclean’s would want to speak inclusively to an educated population that is more and more diverse, not to an imagined “core” of Caucasian readers. By the way, as a male Caucasian myself, I took particular exception to the way my own demographic was caricatured: it seems that all that us white guys want to do at university is get drunk! So here we see a case revealing everything that a university education argues against: ahistorical, anecdotal, un-analytical thought – expressed through sloppy and hurtful language. Many philosophers of language have argued that language is one of the greatest shapers of thought; it may be that we cannot even think what we have no categories to express. This idea was captured succinctly by the great German novelist, Thomas Mann: “speech is itself a critique of life: it names, it characterizes, it passes judgment, in that it creates.”vii Language is also, and obviously, a powerful tool of argument, a means to achieve one’s own ends. But language is not abstract, is not isolated from the world in which it evolves. Words are always the same, and what they say is never the same. Language must be understood in particular histories, in contemporary contexts, and in the light of specific audiences. I hope that your years in university have helped you graduates not only to listen well, but to speak well. To interpret and to use language not only as a projection of your own needs and desires, but as an authentic form of 6  what we really mean by communication. As you choose your words, think about history, think about context and think about your audience. If you do, there is far less chance of being sloppy and hurtful. What’s more, you have the opportunity to make the world better through strong and careful language use intended to advance creative ideas. Good luck to you all.  i  John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Oxford: OUP, 2008). Antonio Porchia, Voces, 1943, translated from Spanish by W.S.

1.0108013~Social-cultural-economic interconnections : UBC and business building a better British Columbia~Gupta, Arvind~1        Social-Cultural-Economic Interconnections: UBC and Business Building a Better British Columbia Prof. Arvind Gupta, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of British Columbia Address to the Vancouver Board of Trade October 1, 2014 (Check Against Delivery)           2 Thank you and good afternoon. It’s an honour to be here, on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish people and in the very good company of the Vancouver Board of Trade. I’d like to begin by acknowledging and thanking Boyden Global Executive Search and the Tribal Group for their sponsorship of today’s lunch. I’d also like to acknowledge and welcome the special guests who have joined us today, Port Coquitlam Mayor Greg Moore, Deputy Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services, John Jacobson, the Chair of the UBC Board of Governors, John Montalbano, and our new Chancellor, Lindsay Gordon. I am, as you know, the new guy – the 13th President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of British Columbia. I suspect some people would have advised me to disavow that number, to skip it like the missing floor on an elevator ride. So if you’re superstitious or if you’re a computer geek, you can think of me in binary – as the one thousand one hundred and first President of UBC. One way or the other, I feel lucky to be here. Building on the example of all those who preceded me, I believe that UBC itself is poised for a fortuitous leap forward in the coming decades. When I say I’m lucky to be here, I mean here in the role of UBC President, but also here with the Board of Trade – a longstanding and highly valued partner. The earliest link I could find was in 1926, when the Board of Trade made a donation to UBC to establish the Faculty of Commerce. We celebrated our first Commerce graduates just three years later. So, I want to acknowledge Iain Black and the Board for all that they do for this great city. Now Ian, next year is UBC’s 100th anniversary and we’re accepting equally magnanimous gifts. Great cities and great universities exist in symbiosis. They go hand-in-hand, feeding, inspiring, and energizing each other. It’s a relationship that has become increasingly integral through the ages. Professor Chuanqi He, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences noted, in 1999, four great ages in human development: • the Stone Age of the hunter-gatherer; • the Agrarian age, which made the first cities possible; • the Industrial Age, which made them both necessary and, often, unpleasant; and • the Knowledge Age. 3 In the last of these, universities went from beneficial constituents of great cities to essential partners. Today, every globally significant city – every city considered amongst the “most liveable” – boasts a world-class university. The urban theorist Richard Florida explained this a decade ago in his book, The Rise of the Creative Class. His research, in places like Austin and Boston, showed that creative cities depend upon innovative universities. From Stanford and Silicon Valley to the university cluster around Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, he documented town and gown working in synergy, enhancing the social and cultural components that underpin a knowledge economy. Industries used to choose locations based on access to physical resources – or tax breaks. Today, they move in search of knowledge workers – intellectuals and artists. Consider the new tenants in the Nordstrom Building on Granville, Sony and Microsoft: they can locate anywhere – but they came here – among other reasons, to take advantage of the people and innovations that flow from this region’s top post-secondary institutions. In its first 99 years, UBC has been indispensable in establishing Metro Vancouver as a provincial economic engine and a Western Canadian centre of culture and innovation. We’ve been essential to the development of B.C.’s resource economy while also pioneering in fields such as health sciences, bio-tech, multi-media, IT and clean tech. We fuel the burgeoning creative sectors – architecture, design, film, gaming, and the performing arts. And we are a mainstay in civil society, providing experts and professionals to the public and not-for-profit sectors, and conducting research that addresses critical social issues. With major campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, nearly 60,000 students, 19,000 faculty and staff, and 300,000 alumni, our influence is felt across the province and around the world. Our economic impact adds up to $12.7 billion annually; that’s 6% of BC’s GDP. Students understand the value of a UBC degree. Last year, we had three applicants for every seat. Thanks to our global reputation, we attracted more than 10,000 international students, among whom the undergraduates alone contribute $600 million annually, to B.C. and to UBC. We leverage the presence of this international contingent in many ways, including generating efficiencies to create hundreds of additional spaces for our own B.C. students. 4 We also deliver an educational experience that is among the best in the world. For example, our completion rate, at 78%, is nearly 20 points higher than the U.S. average of 59%. And the Baccalaureate Graduates Survey shows that, within five years, 96% of UBC alumni are working in high-skill jobs. These are some of the best outcomes in the country. UBC research is also transformative, and we boast some of the finest minds anywhere. Consider that Canada, with less than 0.5% of global population – produces 4.5% of the most frequently cited academic papers. That’s the highest per-capita performance of any nation on earth. Within Canada, UBC is a heavyweight. We attracted $560 million in research funding last year – the second highest in Canada. And we spent it well. With more than 4,000 researchers, and thousands of additional lab and support staff, UBC conducts 70% of academic research in B.C., generating an economic benefit of $6 billion annually. Among Canadian universities, the C.D. Howe Institute ranks UBC first in total patents, U.S. patents and income from licensed intellectual property. And from 1991 to 2010, we ranked second in licenses, inventions and start-ups. We claimed 139 patents and launched 18 spin-off companies in the past three years alone. As I said, I feel incredibly lucky to be involved. But that does not mean that UBC can rest on its laurels. It’s great to be counted among the world’s top 25 public institutions; but, in that company, if you’re not moving up, you’ll quickly find you’re sliding down. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that within 10 years, between one-quarter and one-third of all U.S. universities will be bankrupt. Canada has a different system, but we face the same challenges: • funding pressures; • student demand for a higher return on tuition; • employer demand for students who are job-ready; • increased competition: from online sources; and from other great institutions around the world. So, as much as UBC is doing a remarkable job, we have to do better. To that end, let me set out my five areas of priority: 5 First and foremost, UBC is a Place of Learning. Our primary responsibility is to our students – to your sons and daughters, your future employees and shareholders. Increasingly, the list of students includes all of us. A knowledge economy requires a well-educated populace and a lifetime of learning; and UBC is positioning itself to respond. Second, UBC is a Place of Engagement. The question for me is never: what UBC can do for you; or what you can do for UBC? It is always: what can we do together? Third, UBC is an International Place. We are positioned globally. We compete globally. And for the people of Vancouver, B.C. and Canada, we are both a global microcosm and a nexus – a gateway to the whole social, economic and, we hope, sustainable world. Fourth, UBC is a Place of Innovation, in the way we operate, educate, and participate in the community and the economy. And Fifth, UBC is a Place of Research. That is fundamental: because excellence in research is the distinguishing characteristic for our university. Research excellence puts our students at the cutting edge of knowledge, giving them access to the latest discoveries and revelations. Research excellence allows us to nurture the leaders you need and to answer the questions you bring us. It makes our reputation; it enables us to compete for the kind of faculty that have put UBC in the top 25. And this focus on excellence is what gives us the confidence to aspire to be in the top 10. These five themes are interwoven and I could easily look at UBC through any of the lenses they provide. Today I would like to concentrate on UBC’s innovation agenda. We have developed five strategies: 1. Build strategic partnerships; 2. Improve community access; 3. Increase the employability of our students; 4. Support the innovation ecosystem in our communities; and 5. Build UBC’s internal innovation support structure. Let me touch briefly on each. 6 First, Building Strategic Partnerships highlights our determination to be pro-active in our engagement. UBC has strived to listen to the needs of our partners so we can integrate what we hear into our academic mission. We need to take this up a level. We want to be so connected that we aren’t waiting for partners to call us; we’re looking ahead, anticipating the next challenge they will face. This, again, will benefit the community and as well as UBC. Consider our new Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering program, which we developed with Seaspan and other industry partners. After winning the federal marine procurement bid, Seaspan identified the need for additional highly trained Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. They asked; we listened – and the result? A new program that will include internship placements, so UBC students can acquire the full spectrum of skills needed to grow B.C.’s shipbuilding industry. Strategic partnerships also include consortia in key resource sectors: forestry, mining and LNG. A recent UBC analysis revealed that 24% of our curricula support the resource industry. This includes core programs such as engineering, resource management, environmental studies, First Nations and indigenous studies, freshwater science, and natural resource conservation; It includes complementary programs such as law, management and international business administration;  And it includes supplementary programs that support health and well-being, as well as the full range of technical and social skills and services that are vital in growing communities. We are steadfast in our resolve to boost graduates in all areas that benefit our economy and enhance our society. Our second strategy is Improving Community Access, something that post-secondary strategist Alex Usher describes as “permeability.” We want to be so enmeshed in community – connected by so many strands – that people and ideas flow freely in every direction. We will be perfectly positioned to understand and adapt to what is happening in the community. That means building new programs and augmenting existing infrastructure, such as the UBC Corporate Relations Office and the University-Industry Liaison Office. In the coming weeks, we will announce new initiatives to catalyze economic growth and industrial innovation across Western Canada. 7 We also cannot forget the importance of physical access. The Broadway corridor is a critical West to East axis. Starting at the largest and most influential university in Western Canada, it then connects a series of research-intensive hospitals, a global leadership hub in cancer research, and a host of high-tech employers along Broadway and Great Northern Way. It then goes on past Vancouver Community College to SFU Burnaby in one direction and SFU Surrey in another. Here lies a world-class capacity for knowledge generation. We have a responsibility to follow through with knowledge deployment and knowledge exploitation. How many Microsofts and Sonys might locate long this line, if we can move brainpower effectively and efficiently? This is not a traffic snarl in need of a Band-Aid. This is an opportunity to create the kind of social and economic activity that will transform the corridor into one of national significance. We must not let the Broadway corridor become an unfortunate footnote in the history of transportation planning; I want it to be the reason that the most innovative industries in the world move to our city. The third strategy is Increasing Employability – and here again I want to emphasize lifelong employability. UBC’s constituency has gone beyond 18- to 22-year-old undergraduates or even 22- to 30-year-olds pursuing Masters and PhDs. In a knowledge economy, everyone is a lifelong learner. How can UBC extend its reach? Technology can play a critical role. In addition to enhancing the classroom experience, it can bring UBC home to mature students who are juggling the demands of careers and family or those who live a long way from our campuses. For example, our new Flexible Learning Initiative will leverage mobile technologies and internet connectivity to enable 98 UBC courses to reach an additional 30,000 students over the next three years. And we must be ready to provide every UBC student with career-building opportunities that strengthen their academic and employment outcomes. Here we look to all of you as partners. The strategies we have in mind include: • increasing student exposure and training with industry advisors; • expanding experiential learning; • boosting internships, practica, and research placements; 8 • further embedding professional development into curriculum; and • engaging locally, nationally and internationally. I saw first-hand the effectiveness of this approach at Mitacs, the organization I ran for the past 15 years. Mitacs partnered graduate student interns with companies to address pressing social or technical problems. Students like Megan MacGillivray, a PhD candidate in UBC’s School of Rehabilitation Sciences who collaborated with Sechelt-based Sidestix Technologies, which produces forearm crutches for people with disabilities or injuries. Megan evaluated the biomechanics of peoples’ gait, movement and energy expenditure, enabling Sidestix to design crutches that minimize impact on joints. The evidence is helping Sidestix grow at 33% a year. And the experience made Megan more competent, more confident and more in-demand. That’s been typical at Mitacs: • 6% of Mitacs interns started their own company – twice the usual rate for graduate students • Mitacs partners hired 50% of their interns into full-time positions, 900 of which were new positions; and • A decade out, Mitacs interns earned an average of $10,000 more than other graduate students. Everybody wins – At UBC we plan to deepen our Mitacs partnership as part of a commitment to double student internships and co-op placements. The fourth strategy, Supporting the Innovation Ecosystem, is part of a broader commitment to link research to community – to ensure that cutting edge ideas coming out of UBC flow seamlessly into partner organizations, including those without in-house R&D capabilities. This strategy also includes supporting local, regional and national governments with evidence-based insights for policy design. In my Installation address, I committed UBC to investing an additional $100 million to expand our research capacity. This will be a transformative investment in the people who lead B.C.’s innovation agenda. It will multiply our research impact many times over. The final strategy is to Build UBC’s Internal Support Structures for Innovation.  9 We will begin by improving our own entrepreneurial potential. Entrepreneurship implies an appetite for risk – and innovation – in whatever we do, whether it’s starting a new business or, say, designing a new outpatient service in a clinic or a hospital. Our efforts at UBC include a novel course in the Sauder School called Entrepreneurship 101, open to any second-year student on campus. The first offering attracted 160 students from 12 faculties. The course is part of a broader effort to support entrepreneurship amongst students, faculty, and staff. The net effect of these five strategies is to make UBC more innovative, improving everything from the quality of our teaching and research to the accountability of administrators, including me. We are turning UBC inside out, tearing down any remaining walls between us and you, putting our resources – human, physical and virtual – in service to the community.  And to be clear, by community I mean the whole of civil society: industry, governments, and non-profits.  Our contributions – from art, from knowledge, from innovation – are counted in dollars but also in broader societal impacts. Consider the Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS: Dr. Julio Montaner and his team introduced Treatment as Prevention in a 2006 Lancet paper, and by 2010 they had demonstrated that antiretroviral therapy can reduce HIV/AIDS mortality rates by more than 90%. Hundreds of thousands are seeing their lives made better and their communities made stronger. At UBC we are particularly appreciative when our friends help to push the envelope. Yesterday we announced that geologist and UBC alum Chuck Fipke, who discovered Canada’s first diamond mine, has contributed a total of $9.1 million in UBC’s and Vancouver Coastal Health’s capacity to advance Alzheimer’s research. He’s done so, in part, in honour of former B.C. Premier Bill Bennett, who has been stricken by this cruel disease. This builds on Chuck’s previous contributions at the UBC Okanagan campus in the Chuck Fipke Centre for Innovative Research. We are grateful for his confidence and excited about the potential for major medical advances. The rewards of this kind of community partnership are inestimable. And that is why we must become even closer, whether by improving transportation links or expanding our presence in downtown Vancouver. We will build on our program in the UBC Learning Exchange and our profile in Robson Square. 10 In closing, I want to mention a UBC student program called Imagine, an annual event in which we call on our campus community to envision and engage with all that UBC can be. I’d like to ask you to join us in that exercise: Imagine UBC, BC Cancer, and the hospitals working together to create novel therapeutics, as has been done in Boston. Imagine UBC and its transportation partners revolutionizing goods movement technologies, as is happening in Sydney and Singapore. Imagine linking UBC with the high-tech, health, finance and creative hotspots that have emerged in Toronto, San Diego and London. And now imagine the impact when we do all this simultaneously.  Thank you again for your attention today. It is immensely encouraging to see your support. And be assured, as we reach out to build our society, as we search for new trade links, for top talent, for the latest innovations – UBC is committed – and delighted to be your partner. Thank you. 
1.0357361~Full STEAM Ahead : The Role of Arts in the 21st Century University~Ono, Santa Jeremy~1		Full	STEAM	Ahead:	The	Role	of	Arts	in	the	21st	Century	University	Friday,	March	17,	2017	Faculty	of	Arts,	University	of	British	Columbia		Santa	J.	Ono					The	“liberal	arts”	today	are	generally	understood	to	mean	the	arts	and	social	sciences,	as	distinct	from	the	physical	sciences	and	technology.			But	“liberal	arts”	used	to	be	applied	to	all	the	skills	that	would	enable	a	person	to	act	as	a	responsible	citizen	In	that	sense,	when	we	speak	of	STEM	subjects	versus	the	humanities	versus	professional	education,	we	can	be	said	to	be	drawing	a	distinction	where,	really,	there	is	no	difference.		Properly	educated,	anyone	–	whether	an	engineer,	a	lawyer,	a	philosopher,	artist	or	mathematician	–	should	be	able	to	participate	in	society	We	should	be	talking	about	STEAM,	not	STEM	–	Science,	Technology,	Engineering,	Arts	and	Mathematics		But	increasingly	we	have	raised	barriers	between	subject	areas;	we	have	put	greater	and	greater	value	in	specialization,	working	from	the	theory	that	our	students	must	be	masters	of	their	chosen	field,	requiring	them	to	dedicate	themselves	to	a	particular	subject	The	danger	of	such	divisions	and	specializations	has	long	been	recognized;	perhaps	most	memorably	by	C.	P.	Snow,	the	English	2		novelist,	who,	in	1959,	warned	of	the	danger	of	the	“two	cultures”.		Let	me	quote	from	his	lecture:	A	good	many	times	I	have	been	present	at	gatherings	of	people	who,	by	the	standards	of	the	traditional	culture,	are	thought	highly	educated	and	who	have	with	considerable	gusto	been	expressing	their	incredulity	at	the	illiteracy	of	scientists.	Once	or	twice	I	have	been	provoked	and	have	asked	the	company	how	many	of	them	could	describe	the	Second	Law	of	Thermodynamics.	The	response	was	cold:	it	was	also	negative.	Yet	I	was	asking	something	which	is	the	scientific	equivalent	of:	Have	you	read	a	work	of	Shakespeare’s?	Snow’s	fear	was	that	British	education	was	falling	behind	the	education	provided	in	other	countries	because	it	overvalued	the	humanities	and	the	arts,	at	the	expense	of	science.		Today	we	seem	to	have	moved	to	the	other	extreme:	our	society	is	calling	for	more	and	more	graduates	of	science	and	technology,	granting	the	arts	a	smaller	and	smaller	portion	of	the	educational	pie.		We	need	to	restore	some	balance:	to	promote	the	idea	that	a	liberal	arts	education	is	as	important	to	the	life	of	society	as	science	and	technology.	We	want	to	emphasize	that	the	skills	acquired	by	graduates	of	liberal	arts	programs	will	prepare	them	for	the	demands	of	a	career	in	the	professions;	and	we	want	to	affirm	that	true	literacy	requires	students	in	any	field	to	have	at	least	a	rudimentary	understanding	of	the	basic	principles	of	the	arts	and	the	sciences.			3		So,	for	example,	a	graduate	in	fine	arts	should	have	enough	scientific	understanding	of	geology	and	chemistry	to	understand	the	nature	of	the	mineral	pigments	used	in	the	manufacture	of	paint.	Conversely,	a	medical	science	graduate	should	know	something	of	the	rich	literature	regarding	sickness	and	health,	and	birth	and	death;	and	a	civil	engineer	should	be	aware	of	the	philosophical	discussions	around	where	technology	ends	and	humanity	begins.		I	think	this	is	something	we	can	all	agree	with.		Where	we	run	into	difficulty	is	in	persuading	students	that	there	is	practical	value	in	their	acquiring	some	understanding	of	fields	other	than	their	chosen	discipline.				At	UBC,	like	many	institutions,	we	have	tried	to	apply	the	principle	of	breadth	in	undergraduate	education	by	imposing	program	requirements;	so	a	Science	major,	for	example,	must	take	at	least	12	credits	in	Arts,	as	well	as	up	to	six	credits	in	English.	This	would	seem	to	allow	for	some	reasonable	exposure	to	disciplines	outside	the	area	of	one’s	specialty	Unfortunately,	sometimes	such	electives	are	essentially	add-ons,	courses	that	may	have	little	or	no	relevance	to	a	student’s	ultimate	disciplinary	objectives.	To	deal	with	this,	some	of	our	colleagues	at	UBC	have	approached	the	issue	from	another	angle:	to	offer	students	courses	and	programs	that	cross	disciplines,	bringing	the	arts	and	the	STEM	subjects	into	a	more	coherent	relationship.			4		In	Applied	Science,	for	example,	Engineering	students	have	some	interesting	options:	they	must	take	a	minimum	of	20	credits	in	what	are	called	“complementary	studies,”	which	cover	seven	different	areas:	Engineering	economics;		the	impact	of	technology	on	society;		electives	in	Humanities	and	the	social	sciences;		communications;		health	and	safety;		professional	ethics,	equity	and	law;		and	finally,	sustainable	development	and	environmental	stewardship.			The	goal	here	is	to	enable	students	to	see	their	STEM	subjects	from	different	perspectives,	and	to	encourage	a	more	questioning	and	critical	stance	than	was	apparent	among	engineers	in	the	past.	Alternatively,	you	here	in	the	Faculty	of	Arts	offer	a	dual	degree	program	with	Applied	Science.			In	this	demanding	five-year	program,	students	must	meet	all	the	program	requirements	for	a	Bachelor	of	Arts	and	a	Bachelor	of	Applied	Science	degree.			Indeed,	the	dual	degree	is	beginning	to	attract	students	in	a	variety	of	fields:	over	the	past	year	we	graduated	a	number	of	students	with	dual	degrees	in	Science	and	Music	–	a	marriage	that	I	as	a	scientist	and	musician	can	heartily	endorse.	5		another	group	twinned	Science	with	majors	in	International	Relations,	English,	and	Economics.	Such	developments	are	useful	alternatives	to	traditional	disciplinary	concentrations,	and	are	helping	to	breathe	new	life	into	the	BA.			But	what	we	are	beginning	to	realize	is	that	the	liberal	arts	must	open	themselves	up		to	new	ideas,	not	only	about	the	rapidly	changing	kinds	of	pedagogy	that	are	transforming	education	at	every	level,	but	also	about	the	nature	of	the	liberal	arts	themselves	and	their	role	in	modern	society.	At	UBC,	without	shedding	any	of	the	values	associated	with	the	humanities	and	the	social	sciences,	we	are	responding	to	pressures	for	change	by	introducing	new	courses	to	prepare	students	for	work	in	fields	that	barely	existed	a	decade	ago.			A	student	in	Arts	can	now	take	a	program	in	Cognitive	Systems,	in	which	the	participating	units	are	Philosophy,	Psychology,	Linguistics,	and	Computer	Science.			Through	the	interwoven	study	of	these	fields,	the	student	gains	a	comprehensive	understanding	of	human	cognition,	and	learns	to	apply	this	knowledge	to	create	intelligent	artificial	systems.			Our	Bachelor	of	Media	Studies	program	involves	courses	from	art	history,	film	studies,	English	literature,	information	studies,	and	computer	science.			6		In	partnership	with	three	other	institutions	in	Vancouver,	we	also	offer	a	Master	of	Digital	Media	program	which	assists	students	find	internships	with	companies	like	Google,	EA,	and	Microsoft,	where	their	learning	is	translated	into	real-life	projects.	Your	own	Faculty	of	Arts	also	houses	a	master’s	program	in	Science	and	Technology	Studies,	a	transdisciplinary	field	that	explores	the	human	dimensions	of	science	and	technology.			Topics	include	how	to	understand	the	development	of	scientific	practices	and	technological	objects	in	social	contexts,	the	relations	between	science	and	public	policy,	and	cultural	representations	of	science	and	technology.	These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	how	the	Arts	and	STEM	subjects	are	now	beginning	to	intersect	in	ways	we	could	never	have	predicted	a	few	years	ago.		Such	interrelatedness	is	essential	if	we	are	to	give	our	students	the	kind	of	preparation	that	will	prepare	them	for	a	profession	beyond	the	BA	or	the	BSc	in	an	increasingly	technology-oriented	workplace.	Indeed,	we	should	be	calling	it	STEAM,	not	STEM,	for	Science,	Technology,	Engineering,	Arts	and	Mathematics.	Through	a	combination	of	carefully	crafted	curricular	learning	objectives	in	the	classroom	and	experiential	learning	in	internships	or	co-ops,	the	liberal	arts	student	at	UBC	is	encouraged	to	cultivate	a	unique	professional	identity,	an	identity	that	reflects	their	personal	interests	7		while	at	the	same	time	giving	them	the	tools	they	need	to	succeed	in	a	world	that	is	increasingly	shaped	by	science	and	technology.			And	on	the	other	side	of	the	coin,	engineering	and	science	graduates	are	beginning	to	discover	the	social	and	ethical	implications	of	their	disciplines	through	new	breadth	requirements	and	arts	electives.		What	we’re	all	aiming	for	is	to	create	an	environment	in	which	our	students	are	exposed	to	a	variety	of	ideas,	and	acquire	the	knowledge	and	skills	that	will	enable	them	to	achieve	their	personal	goals	and	become	responsible	members	of	society,	regardless	of	their	choice	of	profession.			We	need	not	be	put	off	by	labels	like	“professionalization”;	rather,	we	should	recognize	that	science,	technology,	and	the	liberal	arts	are	the	necessary	means	by	which	our	students	find	their	pathway	into	a	career	and	a	rich,	fulfilled	life,	and	that	they	are	interdependent.	Science	and	technology	give	us	the	“What”	and	the	“How”	of	our	material	existence;	the	liberal	arts	answer	the	essential	question,	“Why?”	And	without	the	answer	to	that	question,	society	could	not	move	forward	in	any	meaningful	way,	regardless	of	any	advances	in	science	and	technology.	Thank	you.	
1.0357411~Reconciliation Pole Installation Remarks~Ono, Santa Jeremy~	 1	Reconciliation	Pole	Installation	Remarks	Santa	J.	Ono	April	1,	2017				Remarks for Reconciliation Pole Installation: We cannot change the past but we can honestly embrace it I begin by acknowledging all the Elders, Chiefs, and Matriarchs, distinguished and honoured guests, and by welcoming all of you, our many friends and family. We are so honoured to have you with us. Thank you for your work, your leadership and support, and for joining us today. I am thrilled to be with you, and to be a part of history in the making. It is truly a great honour to participate and to bear witness to what, for many of us, is surely a once-in-a-lifetime event. I want to thank all of you who have come together from so many places and worked for so long to join in the important work of developing respectful and productive relationships between our communities. In particular, I extend warm thanks to our host nations – upon whose traditional territories our campuses are located. All of you have worked really hard – with patience, diligence and unwavering commitment – to build a road to better relations and a better future. I salute you. The road continues to be a long one, and I am deeply humbled and honoured to be on this journey with you. A university is a place where people of all ages and backgrounds come together – to teach, to learn, to question, and to discover the truth of things. Two remarkable initiatives at UBC are now further reflecting upon the truth of our shared history, and offering hope and inspiration for the future. One is the 55-foot pole we will place today – called “Reconciliation Pole” – by master carver 7idansuu (pronounced ee-dan-suu) James Hart, Haida Hereditary Chief. The other is the new UBC Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre – or IRSC, that is currently under construction on the other end of Main Mall. Together, they will provide a landmark and a place to better understand the history and lasting effects of Canada’s Indian residential schools. We cannot change the past, but we can honestly recognize it. As the scales fall from our eyes, we can see clearly what we did not see before. Witnessing “Reconciliation Pole” today, we can’t help but feel pain and sorrow. The work tells the story of the time before, during, and after the Indian residential school system – a system that caused so much harm. We may also feel a sense of deep gratitude, for only in learning the truth can we work together, towards a better future. 	 2	UBC was honoured to partner with the Audain Foundation to commission this beautiful and powerful work. I wish to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Michael Audain, 7idansuu, and the team of carvers, who have made this historic landmark possible. This brings me to the second initiative. The Pole will face in the direction of the UBC Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre located between Koerner Library and the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. The IRSC will open in the next academic year, and provide residential school survivors and communities access to the records of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and ways for students, faculty, visitors—ways for all of us—to learn about the history and lasting effects of Indian residential schools, and the larger systems of which they were a part. Working in partnership with the National Research Centre for Truth and Reconciliation in Winnipeg, the centre will focus on the experiences of Indigenous people across Canada, but especially in British Columbia. The centre will provide onsite access to records and information, and also electronic tools that provide access across Canada and around the world. It will be a place to explore contemporary relationships, and to develop ways of thinking and working together that will benefit us all. Much good work has been done, but there is still so much more to do. A continued commitment to truth, respect and understanding, will enable us to deepen our work and contribute to a better future. I am so grateful to all of you for being here on this extraordinary day. I’m looking forward to hearing the other speakers and joining in the placing of the pole. This is truly a day to celebrate and to remember. Thank you again for being here and for joining us in this historic event. 	
1.0357462~The role of the universities in the creation of a tech corridor in Cascadia~Ono, Santa Jeremy~1		The	role	of	the	universities	in	the	creation	of	a	tech	corridor	in	Cascadia			September	20,	2016	Santa	J.	Ono		First,	I	want	to	welcome	our	guests	and	colleagues	from	across	the	border.		In	many	ways	this	conference	is	a	reminder	that	the	US	and	Canada	have	long	been	each	other’s	closest	partner,	exchanging	people	and	ideas	as	well	as	goods.		In	the	realm	of	knowledge	discovery	and	dissemination,	borders	should	have	no	meaning.		We	benefit	most	when	we	work	together,	and	I’m	happy	to	remind	you	that	Canadian	and	American	scholars	and	scientists	are	extensively	embedded	in	the	libraries,	laboratories,	and	classrooms	of	each	other’s	countries.		I	also	want	to	thank	Microsoft	for	its	role	in	sponsoring	this	event.	Microsoft	is	playing	a	major	role	in	developing	tech	industries	in	this	part	of	the	world,	and	in	bringing	all	parts	of	the	Pacific	Northwest	closer	together.			Over	the	last	few	hours	we’ve	heard	a	good	deal	about	tech	corridors,	how	they	have	developed,	and	how	they	might	develop	in	this	region.		The	question	before	us	now	is,	in	what	ways	can	universities	contribute	to	achieving	that	goal?		This	should	be	a	relatively	straightforward	proposition.		Big	universities	like	UBC	and	the	University	of	Washington	already	conduct	large	research	enterprises	in	areas	such	as	information	technology,	digital	media,	software	development	and	so	on.		And	I’m	happy	to	note	that	we	already	do	engage	with	one	another	in	a	variety	of	ways:	so,	for	example,	the	Pacific	Institute	for	the	Mathematical	Sciences,	based	at	UBC,	is	a	consortium	of	universities	that	includes	UW	as	a	member.		And	then	there’s	UBC’s	Applied	Science	Faculty,	which	holds	an	annual	conference	with	the	University	of	Washington	around	the	topic	of	hydrology	and	water	resources—a	conference	that	has	been	going	on	since	the	mid-1970s.		So	there	are	cross-border	connections.	But	we	are	nowhere	close	to	realizing	the	potential	that	lies	in	a	greater	combination	of	our	individual	2		capabilities,	allied	to	coordinated	initiatives	by	government	and	industry.		To	move	that	agenda	forward,	we	need	to	convince	ourselves	and	our	partners	that	the	conditions	are	right:	that	the	necessary	political,	social,	and	economic	factors	are	in	place	to	transform	the	Cascadia	region	into	a	technological	hub	comparable	to	Silicon	Valley	and	Boston.			 We	need	to	remember	that	universities	do	not	operate	in	a	vacuum.	Whether	we	are	talking	about	student	access	and	mobility,	research	priorities,	transportation	links,	or	physical	facilities,	we	are	inextricably	linked	to	the	socio-economic	environments	in	which	we	find	ourselves.		Most	universities,	including	UBC	and	UW,	were	established	to	meet	the	practical	needs	of	a	new	settler	society,	and	that	sense	of	responsibility	to	the	state	or	province	of	their	foundation	remains,	as	indeed	it	should,	a	strong	influence	on	their	mission	and	operation.				In	the	public	realm	especially,	universities	must	also	depend	on	the	support	they	receive	from	regional	and	national	governments,	both	for	research	funding,	whether	basic	or	applied,	and	for	operating.	The	consequence	of	such	arrangements	is	that	decisions	about	the	teaching	and	research	enterprise	are	rarely	made	unilaterally;	university	presidents	in	Canada	spend	a	lot	of	their	time	keeping	a	wary	eye	on	provincial	and	federal	ministers	and	trying	to	influence	the	direction	of	research	and	innovation	policy.				In	Canada,	our	federal	government	has	recently	launched	two	important	initiatives:	a	fundamental	science	review	and	a	consultation	on	Canada’s	innovation	agenda.	Combined,	these	two	initiatives	aim	to	address	how	best	to	foster	an	innovation-based	economy	in	the	21st	Century.	In	doing	so,	they	are	asking	important	questions	about	the	globally	competitive	levels	of	research	funding,	best	practices	for	“big	science”,	and	whether	or	not	Canadian	innovators	and	researchers	have	the	right	supports	to	collaborate	across	borders.	So	this	conference	is	very	timely	within	the	national	discourse	in	Canada.			3		And	as	you	know,	in	British	Columbia,	the	provincial	government	recently	launched	its	Tech	Strategy.	It	is	an	important	acknowledgement	of	the	role	the	tech	sector	is	playing	in	our	provincial	economy	and	a	needed	commitment	to	provide	the	supports	to	ensure	the	sector	flourishes.			Since	1998	the	provincial	government	has	provided	important	matching	funding	to	ensure	universities	attract	Canada	Foundation	for	Innovation	funding	for	research	infrastructure	through	its	Knowledge	Development	Fund.	Through	this	and	other	provincial	programs	such	as	Genome	BC	and	the	Michael	Smith	Foundation	for	Health	Research,	UBC	and	our	sister	institutions	in	BC	have	been	able	to	build	the	kind	of	solid	foundation	that	makes	advanced	research	possible	and	contributes	to	both	provincial	and	national	socio-economic	wellbeing.		BC	is	indeed	a	place	where	research	and	innovation	flourish.		And	as	I	hope	you	know,	UBC	itself	is	a	major	player	in	the	research	enterprise.	After	that	University	in	Eastern	Canada,	we	are	the	second	largest	research	institution	in	Canada.	In	the	past	year	we	garnered	$600	million	in	research	funding,	supporting	almost	9,000	research	projects	across	the	university.		We	conduct	90%	of	the	industry-sponsored	research	in	BC.		In	2015,	UBC	was	in	the	73rd	percentile	for	tech	transfer	among	North	American	universities,	and	in	the	87th	percentile	among	Canadian	universities.			In	2016,	UBC	was	in	the	92nd	percentile	for	start-up	company	creation	among	North	American	universities,	and	in	the	97th	percentile	among	Canadian	universities.		So	UBC	is	and	should	be	a	critical	partner	as	we	discuss	further	strengthening	cross-border	collaborations.			Successful	research	universities	must	be	actively	engaged	along	the	full	range	of	the	innovation	spectrum	–	fostering	and	recruiting	talent,	pushing	the	edges	of	discovery	and	helping	bridge	those	discoveries	to	the	market	place,	the	hospital	bed,	or	to	government	policy.			Large	research	universities	like	Washington	and	UBC	supply	both	the	technical	know-how	and	the	qualified	graduates	to	keep	our	industries	at	the	4		forefront	of	world	markets.		We	contribute	to	the	development	and	evolution	of	new	companies,	products,	and	services,	and	create	the	new	technologies	that	industry	needs	to	remain	productive	and	competitive.	UBC	students	have	the	benefit	of	the	largest	co-op	education	program	in	Western	Canada,	gaining	invaluable	work	experience	before	they	graduate,	and	facilitating	the	exchange	of	knowledge	between	industry	and	academia.				To	further	promote	research-industry	collaborations,	UBC’s	University-Industry	Liaison	Office—the	UILO—helps	start-ups	and	spin-offs,	and	provides	the	kind	of	network	and	know-how	that	enables	researchers	to	bring	their	discoveries	into	the	marketplace.	UILO	is	comprised	of	two	distinct	groups:	the	Sponsored	Research	Group	and	the	Technology	Transfer	Group.	Both	groups	are	recognized	nationally,	negotiating	more	than	2,500	contracts,	issuing	hundreds	of	patents	and	licensing	agreements,	and	spinning	off	new	companies	each	year.					One	of	UBC’s	most	successful	spin-offs	is	Westport	Innovations,	BC's	largest	clean	tech	company.	The	company	engineers	the	world's	most	advanced	natural	gas	engines	and	vehicles,	reducing	emissions	and	fuel	costs,	employing	more	than	450	people	in	BC	and	over	1,000	in	Canada,	all	with	technology	developed	at	UBC.	The	company	was	initially	built	through	close	partnerships	with	UBC	researchers,	grad	students	and	lab	facilities,	and	maintains	extensive	research	partnerships	with	UBC	to	this	day.		I	offer	this	example	to	emphasize	how	UBC	has	already	developed	the	kind	of	expertise	in	university-industry	start-up	and	collaboration	that	could	well	create	a	platform	for	the	kind	of	partnership	that	is	the	theme	of	this	conference.		Not	only	do	we	produce	the	brainpower;	we	also	know	how	and	where	to	apply	it	to	the	greatest	effect.		Success	 in	 joint	 enterprises	 of	 the	 kind	 I’ve	 been	 describing	 is	 predicated	 on	strength	in	local	and	regional	economies.	Partnership	supposes	strengths	on	each	side,	both	in	broad	economic	terms	and	at	the	more	granular	level	of	research	and	manufacturing	capacities.	The	states	and	provinces	that	form	Cascadia	are	in	such	5		a	position.		I	will	speak	only	of	British	Columbia	in	this	context,	to	emphasize	that	the	province	would	be	a	strong	partner	in	the	kind	of	alliance	we	are	contemplating	today,	 an	 alliance	 built	 around	 advanced	 technologies	 and	 their	 associated	industries.			Despite	some	stagnation	in	the	Canadian	economy	and	setbacks	in	resource	investment,	BC	has	continued	to	forge	ahead,	enjoying	a	boom	in	technology-based	industry	and	manufacturing,	along	with	the	lowest	unemployment	rate	in	Canada;	indeed,	the	projections	are	for	BC	to	lead	Canada	in	economic	growth	over	the	2016-2017	economic	period.		And	over	the	last	five	years	Vancouver	has	become	a	technological	hub,	developing	real	strengths	in	film-making,	special	effects,	and	electronic	games.			Part	of	our	region’s	strength	lies	in	the	high	quality	of	its	education	system—a	necessary	precondition	for	the	creation	of	a	tech	corridor.		Our	universities	and	colleges	play	an	increasingly	important	role	in	helping	the	province	maintain	a	strong	position	within	the	Canadian	economy.	The	economic	impact	of	university	research	on	the	provincial	economy	through	knowledge	transfer	has	been	estimated	at	$8	billion	annually.		UBC	alone	engages	in	hundreds	of	research	projects	each	year	that	boost	employment	and	contribute	substantially	to	the	provincial	GDP.		Our	licensed	technologies	are	at	the	heart	of	a	huge	range	of	treatments,	products,	processes	and	services	that	have	generated	an	estimated	$12	billion	in	sales.			 None	of	the	factors	I	have	discussed	so	far—government	funding,	public-private	partnerships,	or	the	role	of	universities	in	contributing	to	regional	economic	strength—mean	much	if	they	are	not	underpinned	by	the	capacity	to	generate	new	ideas—if	they	lack	the	brainpower	and	curiosity	that	sustain	fundamental	research	and	bring	about	innovation.		Research	is	nothing	if	it	is	not	driven	by	a	desire	to	discover	the	unknown,	and	to	turn	that	discovery	into	something	new—whether	a	new	product,	a	new	way	of	thinking,	a	new	solution	to	an	old	problem.		This	is	where	universities	excel:	in	creating	the	conditions	in	which	innovation	can	flourish,	in	which,	with	time	and	financial	support,	people	6		can	dedicate	themselves	to	bring	about	changes	in	the	ways	we	act,	think,	or	create.					Recognizing	this,	industry	is	turning	more	and	to	the	universities	to	find	new	ways	of	solving	their	problems,	to	help	them	develop	new	products	or	improve	quality	and	efficiency.			So,	for	example,	Boeing	and	SkyNRG,	with	support	from	Canada’s	aviation	industry	and	other	stakeholders,	are	collaborating	with	UBC	to	turn	leftover	branches,	sawdust	and	other	forest-industry	waste	into	sustainable	aviation	biofuel.		And	industrial	partners	are	making	more	and	more	use	of	UBC	facilities	such	as	our	Imaging	Lab	or	our	Centre	for	High-Throughput	Phenogenomics,	to	help	them	test	new	products	or	examine	the	causes	of	disease.			Within	Canada,	there	are	more	and	more	such	instances	of	collaborative	enterprise	fostering	innovation.		Provincial	and	federal	governments	are	beginning	to	recognize	the	importance	of	innovation	to	a	healthy	and	thriving	economy.		Our	federal	government’s	innovation	agenda	articulated	last	June	includes	the	creation	of	research	clusters	and	partnerships—the	kind	of	partnerships	within	and	between	universities	and	industry,	between	public	and	private,	and	across	national	borders,	that	we	are	envisaging	here	today.				UBC	and	Vancouver	are	certainly	ready	for	the	kind	of	opportunities	that	a	tech	corridor	would	present.		Microsoft’s	new	presence	in	the	city	in	the	form	of	its	Excellence	Centre	promises	to	act	as	a	spur	to	innovation	in	many	aspects	of	software	development;	and	it	encourages	us	to	think	about	creating	networks	linking	UBC	data	scientists,	Microsoft	Research,	and	software	engineering	scientists	at	UW.		A	number	of	UBC	researchers	in	computer	science	and	electrical	and	computer	engineering	already	have	strong	connections	and	ongoing	projects	with	Microsoft	Research	in	Redmond;	given	the	right	support,	this	could	easily	expand	into	a	much	broader	and	more	comprehensive	relationship.				We	can	and	must	forge	new	alliances;	we	must	learn	how	to	draw	on	one	another’s	strengths;	we	must	develop	a	climate	of	collaboration	and	7		complementarity,	if	we	want	the	region	to	prosper,	if	we	want	to	bring	about	economic	growth	and	social	wellbeing	on	both	sides	of	the	border.			Collectively	we	have	the	brainpower	to	make	this	possible.		What	we	need	is	to	find	a	way	of	unleashing	that	brainpower,	perhaps	by	the	creation	of	a	supra-national	regional	authority	that	could	bring	universities,	governments,	and	the	private	sector	together;	not	to	create	a	new	independent	nation	as	John	Quincy	Adams	believed	might	happen	in	the	Pacific	Northwest,	but	rather	to	enrich	the	lives	of	people	on	both	side	of	the	border	and	contribute	to	the	prosperity	and	wellbeing	of	all	the	citizens	of	Canada	and	the	United	States.				Thank	you.					(http://www.gov.bc.ca/citz/technologyandinnovation/Funding/examples.html)	(https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2016MTICS0012-000835)		(http://webometrics.info/en/North_america)		
1.0357433~Thriving at UBC : Encouraging healthy minds on healthy campuses~Ono, Santa Jeremy~|1		KKHEALTHY	MINDS	|| 	HEALTHY	CAMPUSES 	KEYNOTE	SPEECH 	 	THRIVING	AT 	UBC: 	ENCOURAGING	HEALTHY	MINDS	ON	HEALTHY	CAMPUSES 			April	4,	2017	(9:30	a.m.)		Morris	J.	Wosk	Centre	for	Dialogue	580	W.	Hastings	St.,	Vancouver			Thriving at UBC: Encouraging healthy minds on healthy campuses 	Santa	J.	Ono	Minister Wilkinson, distinguished guests: I am honoured by the opportunity to speak to you today about mental health and how UBC is encouraging healthy minds on healthy campuses, an issue I am personally involved in, as I will explain in a minute. First I am glad CMHA BC is considering endorsing the Okanagan Charter: An International Charter for Health Promoting Universities. We are proud of the Charter, which came out of the ground-breaking work at the 2015 International Conference on Health Promoting Universities and Colleges, held at the UBC Okanagan campus in Kelowna. We were the first university to adopt the Charter. In 2016 I signed the Charter on behalf of the university, formally adopting UBC’s commitment to advancing wellbeing by embedding it into our teaching, learning and working environments. We are fully committed to the Charter because we strongly believe there is a need for social and emotional learning support and resources across the education spectrum, in particular in higher education. Mental health is a significant issue: one in five Canadians will have a mental health problem or illness this year. While conversations about mental health are now happening more frequently, many people are reluctant to talk about mental health, with four in 10 Canadian workers saying they would likely ignore or hide a mental illness diagnosis. That is why I am heartened by the CMHA BC’s b4stage4 campaign, with its focus on prevention, early identification and early intervention. As CMHA BC notes on the b4stage4 website, we’d never allow our system of care to treat cancer the way we treat mental illness and addiction. We should be educating, screening and taking action 2		early. Yet people are often left waiting for care. Some are too ashamed to even ask for help. The standard of treatment should be equal between mental and physical health conditions. Mental health issues are especially relevant to young people. One study shows 15 percent of university students are diagnosed with a mental illness while in university – and that doesn’t include those who don’t seek treatment. Students – whether elementary, high school, or university students – are especially vulnerable – and we need to ensure there are supports for them, from kindergarten through Grade 12 through college and university. It is important to integrate mental health and well-being discussions at all stages of education. Naturally, my focus is on university education, but that is not to deny the importance of K-12. With regard to university students, many of them are away from home for the first time, without the support of their family and friends, in a new, confusing and seemingly uncaring environment; at a time in their lives when they are still developing – in that vulnerable stage between childhood and maturity. I can speak from personal experience. When I was younger, I suffered from depression and twice tried to take my own life – first when I was a teenager and then in my late 20s. I partied hard, and I also studied hard. Took foolish risks. Learned the hard way that balance and the support of family, friends and colleagues are important. I would not have made it through what were some very dark times in my life without support. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. If you have the proper counseling and support, it’s really possible for you to move past that and move back into functioning life. But first we have to ensure the proper supports are there, and that we make them available to our students – and to the other members of our university family. Therefore, I am determined – and UBC is determined – to ensuring that members of the UBC community – whether students, faculty or staff – have the support they need, when they need it. UBC is committed to healthy and sustainable workplaces, undergraduate and graduate student experiences, and the development of a vibrant intellectual community. This commitment includes a commitment to enhancing mental health and wellbeing of students, staff and faculty. One example of this is Thrive. Thrive is both a mindset and an annual week-long series of events focused on building positive mental health for everyone at UBC. You can learn more about Thrive at thrive.ubc.ca. Thrive began as an idea between two colleagues at the UBC Vancouver campus in the spring of 2009. They shared common goals in wanting to help create a campus environment that better understood the importance of mental health and wellbeing as well as one that was supportive of individuals to make choices that promoted not only healthy bodies but healthy minds. Creating this type of a cultural shift was not going to be an easy task but they decided to try a new approach: creating wellbeing programming to include student, staff and faculty audiences. Thrive grew over the years. It expanded to Okanagan in 2011. By 2013, it had over 50 partners and 70 events. It has since won awards and been recommended as an example for other institutions to emulate. 3		Thrive helps to create a more supportive environment at UBC; by raising awareness of the connection between mental health, wellbeing and academic success; and by linking students to services and resources that help build positive mental health. UBC’s Student Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy addresses the following areas: § Institutional policies and practices § Providing a supportive environment § Mental health awareness and self-management skills § Early identification of students needing assistance and connection to appropriate resources § Adequate, timely mental health services § Case management and risk mitigation protocols As I mentioned, students in particular need our support, because they are at a vulnerable period in their lives – a period of great changes and upheavals, and a period when passing and failing has serious consequences. But I am hopeful that today’s students – given the proper support – can thrive. The students at UBCs two campuses are a real inspiration to me, very empathetic towards each other. Many of them have seen someone take their own lives. Today, young people are much more aware of what’s happening than when I was in university, and that’s a good thing. It’s motivating them to do something about it. It’s motivating them to demand adults and leaders within organizations to do something about it. But not just students, UBC is also committed to the mental health and wellbeing of the entire university community. health and wellbeing of staff and faculty is a fundamental component of the University’s commitment to building and maintaining an outstanding work environment. To create a healthy, inspiring workplace that cultivates wellbeing, resilience and commitment, the University focuses on an integrated approach that address both staff and faculty member’s individual skills and knowledge of resources, as well as the organizational culture of workplaces to better support healthy behaviors and access to healthy choices. The University’s commitment to diversify and expand healthy workplace initiatives focuses on: § The development and support of organizational culture that challenges mental health stigma and supports mental resiliency § Early intervention for staff and faculty needing assistance and referral to mental health resources § Institutional practices § The development of individual understanding of mental health and mental illness § The expansion of awareness of mental health resources and access to mental health screenings and educational trainings Again, Thrive addresses these objectives by helping to create a more supportive environment at UBC, by raising awareness of the connection between mental health and wellbeing and workplace practices and by linking staff and faculty to services and resources to build positive mental health. I’ve outlined some of the ways UBC supports its community members – its students, faculty and staff. I am glad we have such supports in place today. 4		When I was younger, there were fewer supports available, but I did have some significant help, for which I am grateful. For the last 25 years, I’ve been symptom-free. A big part of the balance in my life is that I have a loving family, and they’re there for me. I recognize that not everybody has those supports, and that’s why it’s important that initiatives like Thrive and commitments like the Okanagan Charter are encouraged and emulated. Thank you.  |
1.0357435~Universities and the "Innovation Economy"~Ono, Santa Jeremy~1  Universities and the “Innovation Economy”  A talk for the BCBC, 1 November 2016  Thank you very much.  It’s a real honour to be invited to speak at this important summit of BC’s business leaders, coming together to chart a course for economic growth and prosperity in a time of change and uncertainty.  I don’t have to tell an audience of this nature just how important planning is.  We need to have a clear idea of where we’re going, and how we’re going to get there; we need to create timelines and contingency plans; we need to have confidence in the future, even though we cannot know what that future may bring.    Who in 2007 would have dreamed that in 2008 the Lehman Brothers would go down?  Who in 2014 would have foreseen oil at less than $50 a barrel just a year later?  Regardless of all the predictions by experts, the reality is that we cannot know the future, nor how we might evade all the twists and turns that it may contain.  2  What we do know is the past—what worked and what didn’t—and just as importantly, we know the present.  Learning from the past, we can exercise control over the present; and in exercising that control wisely, ethically, and creatively, we can hope to influence our future in positive and fruitful ways.  Last week I had the pleasure of meeting some of the business community in Kelowna.  The south Okanagan, as you may know, has depended for its prosperity on agriculture, especially fruit growing and wine production.  But that is changing.    According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Kelowna is the most entrepreneurial city in the country—that is, the best place to start and grow a business.  To achieve this kind of status, you must have the right kind of infrastructure in place, and according to the Federation, Kelowna is in that position.    It has a highly skilled workforce; it has two important educational institutions, UBC Okanagan and Okanagan College; it has a bustling airport, and in the words of the Kelowna Daily Courier, it has “a welcoming business community, and a quality of life that attracts entrepreneurs, workers, students, families and retirees alike.” 3   The Courier goes on to point out something potentially even more significant: the city’s growing capacity in connectivity, which provides “massive internet capabilities for businesses that need it.”   “That connectivity,” says the article, “has helped the Okanagan become home to more than 750 high-tech firms that have created a $1.3-billion-a-year sector employing more than 7500 people.”  Connectivity, high-tech, and a highly-skilled work-force: this is a foundation for the future, and it’s already in place in Kelowna.    These are key elements in any plan to lay the groundwork for the future prosperity and wellbeing of our population locally, regionally, and nationally.  And to derive the maximum amount of advantage from them, we need to think out of the box: we need to bring new ways of thinking into the equation, to draw on the capacity for innovation that marks every successful enterprise—whether it’s in business, in technology, in medical research, or in the arts.   The business I’m in is education: and the spirit of innovation is very much at the heart of what we are trying to do in our schools, colleges, and universities today.  Traditional methods of teaching and 4  learning are being transformed as we prepare our students to meet the challenges of a world very different from the one encountered by their parents and grandparents.   The era of the “sage on the stage” has passed, and students have progressed far beyond the passive recipients of information they were in the old days.  Today, professors tend to be facilitators, creating the right environments for students to acquire information in a variety of dynamic ways.  Courses in many areas, such as law, medicine, and engineering, are often case-based or problem-based, requiring students to work collaboratively in teams to find solutions—and preparing them for the way problems are tackled in the working world beyond university.    At UBC we are responding to pressures for change by introducing new courses to prepare students for work in fields that barely existed a decade ago.  A student in Arts can now take a program in Cognitive Systems, in which the participating units are Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, and Computer Science.  Through the interrelated study of these fields, the student gains a comprehensive understanding of human cognition, and learns to apply this knowledge to create intelligent artificial systems.   5   The traditional barriers between disciplines are disappearing as we try to prepare students for the demands of the working world.  So, for example, a student in Applied Science can twin her studies in hydraulic engineering with a program in entrepreneurship, so that she is prepared for the post-university challenges of commercializing and monetizing her skills.   And then of course there’s the whole area of information technology. The huge expansion of digital tools has revolutionized the business of teaching and learning. Many courses now take a blended approach, mixing face-to-face presentations with online or video presentations.  Students now have instantaneous access to vast electronic databases, and require a sophisticated understanding of software tools to access and use that information.  So you can see that the university is laying the groundwork for a highly skilled and tech savvy workforce, a workforce that will be ready to build on the technological and scientific advances we see taking place around us every day.    6  An important component of this strategy is the expansion in numbers of our international students.  At one time the idea of internationalizing the university was seen as something threatening and undesirable, because it was thought that such students were taking seats that should be reserved for domestic students only.  But under my predecessors, UBC began to expand international enrolment, recognizing that there is a huge pool of potential talent, investment, and immigration that will be of immense benefit to this country.  UBC is now acknowledged to be the most international university on the continent.  Recruitment of top international students brings with it future networks and linkages that will reinforce and increase trade with our international partners, notably in east and south Asia.  In these ways, then, universities are helping our society to prepare to meet the challenges facing regional and national economies.  The challenge is real: we need to recognize that Canada, despite its great natural wealth and its industrial expertise, is falling behind in terms of the productivity, competitiveness, and trained workforce needed to stay abreast of the competition.  In global terms, we’re in a period of economic stagnation; if we are to regain our position as a leader in world trade, we must find new products, new methods of production, new markets for our goods: in a word, we must innovate.   7   To respond to this challenge, the federal government has recently launched two important initiatives: a fundamental science review and a consultation on Canada’s innovation agenda. Combined, these two initiatives aim to address how best to foster an innovation-based economy in the 21st Century. In doing so, they are asking important questions about the globally competitive levels of research funding, best practices for “big science”, and whether or not Canadian innovators and researchers have the right kinds of support to achieve their goals.   Our province is responding in similar fashion. The BC government is just as concerned to find ways of giving our economy a jump-start and laying a strong foundation for future growth.    Since 1998 the province has provided important matching dollars through its Knowledge Development Fund to ensure universities attract Canada Foundation for Innovation funding for research infrastructure. Through this and other provincial programs such as Genome BC and the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, UBC and our sister institutions in BC have been able to build the kind of solid foundation that makes advanced research possible and encourages innovation. 8   The province has created its own blueprint for innovation, in the form of the BC Tech Strategy announced earlier this year.  Through grants and other financial incentives to employers and educational institutions, the provincial government hopes to stimulate applied research, create a highly-skilled workforce, and encourage job growth.  This is an important acknowledgement of the role the tech sector is playing in our provincial economy as a complement to the resource sector; BC is coming to terms with the reality that our economy is increasingly dependent on science and technology, and so is investing heavily in research and innovation.  And as I hope you know, UBC itself is a major player in the research enterprise. We are the second largest research institution in Canada. In the past year we have attracted $600 million in research funding, supporting almost 9,000 research projects across the university.  From year to year, we conduct 90% of the industry-sponsored research in BC.  In 2016, UBC was in the 92nd percentile for start-up company creation among North American universities, and in the 97th percentile among Canadian universities. So you can see, UBC is a significant participant in the research strategies promoted by our regional and national governments. 9   One of the most important ways in which UBC is contributing to the innovation agenda is through our commitment to the development of research clusters.  These are interdepartmental networks of leaders in particular fields who are brought together to investigate large problems that resist individual solutions, but are opening up their secrets in the face of collaborative research.    So, for example, a cluster has been formed by bringing together researchers from the Faculty of Forestry, Botany, the Michael Smith Laboratories, Biodiversity, and the Faculty of Land and Food Systems: they have formed a forestry and plant productivity group studying plant genomics and bio-products from renewable resources.  Another cluster that has brought scholars from a variety of fields together is one with the title “Remembering and Commemorating Trauma.”  Taking its cue from the work of the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Committee, scholars in this interdisciplinary group are interested in the impact of traumatic events on the individual, on society, and on marginalized groups within society.  It’s made up of researchers from History, Social Work, Creative Writing, Critical Studies, Psychology, Indigenous Studies, and Philosophy.  An important aspect 10  of this research is its examination of the ways in which our responses to trauma can be used to heal, reconcile, and empower.  As this last example illustrates, such clusters encourage scholars to break through disciplinary barriers and engage with one another in innovative ways, leading to both knowledge creation and knowledge translation—that is, the application of new discoveries for the health and wellbeing of society.  Of course, the principle of pooling resources and collaborating across sectors is not limited to universities; it’s already working in industry, as we can see in such projects as the regional innovation clusters produced in Germany over the last half-century by the Fraunhofer [Frown-hawfer] institutes of applied research.  Here in Canada we should make such collaborations a priority, both within universities and between universities and industry, because experience has shown that this approach does lead to innovation and technological breakthroughs.   I hope it’s clear from what I’ve been saying that UBC’s commitment to innovation does not stop at our gates.  As a major research university, consistently ranked among the top 40 in the world, UBC is supplying both the technical know-how and the qualified graduates to help move our industries to the forefront of world 11  markets.  We contribute to the development and evolution of new companies, products, and services, and create the new technologies that industry will need to remain productive and competitive. UBC students have the benefit of the largest co-op education program in Western Canada, gaining invaluable work experience before they graduate, and facilitating the exchange of knowledge between industry and academia.    To further promote research-industry collaborations, UBC’s University-Industry Liaison Office—the UILO—helps start-ups and spin-offs, and provides the kind of network and know-how that enables researchers to bring their discoveries into the marketplace.  The UILO is comprised of two distinct groups: the Sponsored Research Group and the Technology Transfer Group. Both groups are recognized nationally, negotiating more than 2,500 contracts, issuing hundreds of patents and licensing agreements, and spinning off new companies each year.     Collaboration of this kind, between university research and industrial application, is becoming more and more significant, and it is this kind of collaboration that really defines what we’re calling the “innovation economy.”   12  Let me take you back to Kelowna to give you an example: UBC Okanagan has begun to develop a 30-acre Innovation Precinct to accommodate productive long-term engagement with industry and non-profits.  This will bring together industrial partners who want to draw on our research excellence to develop and test new products.  Earlier this year UBC Okanagan signed an agreement with Avcorp Industries from Delta BC, a leading supplier of integrated composite and metallic aerostructures.  The agreement is to develop a “Learning Factory  for Advanced Composites,” which will integrate industrial production with learning and research in high-tech, drawing on the expertise of our faculty and giving our students hands-on experiential learning.    This kind of partnership holds great promise, not only for the university and industrial partners, but also for the economy of the region, since over the longer term such arrangements have a ripple effect, bringing training for students, creating manufacturing jobs in the private sector, and offering the promise of new industries and a diversified economic base in the Okanagan.    There’s an added dimension to growing the innovation economy through university research.  I recently had the pleasure of participating 13  in a conference with the president of the University of Washington, at which we explored the possibility of creating a “tech corridor” in the Pacific Northwest.  The “Cascadia Corridor” would bring together some of the finest minds on the continent to create the kind of synergy you find in Boston or the Silicon Valley.    In conjunction with the University of Washington, we’re exploring ways of creating an innovation hub that would see the great universities of the Pacific Northwest collaborate with each other and tech giants like Microsoft and Google, in the development of new tools and applications that would transform the economies of the region.  And since that conference, UBC has been taking a fresh look at areas like biomedical engineering and digital media, with a view to optimizing our research capabilities through joint projects.  So the future holds great promise—that is, if we make the kinds of investment that will pay large dividends: investments in interdisciplinary learning and research; in cross-border collaboration; in incubators and start-ups; in the preparation of a trained and flexible workforce; in research clusters that combine complementary strengths in a variety of fields; and in partnerships between universities, governments, and industry. 14   But perhaps the most important investment we can make to ensure the success of an innovation-based economy is in the development of human capital: the education of a highly-skilled, flexible, and creative population.  It’s a cliché, perhaps, but the wealth of a nation lies in the capabilities and resourcefulness of its people; and the key to tapping those capabilities, that resourcefulness, lies in education.  Great universities like UBC nurture and stimulate the capabilities, imagination, and leadership qualities that are the foundation of a society’s prosperity.    I’m speaking now not only about economic prosperity, but social prosperity too.  We need to develop new ideas, not just in science and technology, not just in industrial production, but in meeting the social challenges that still lie before us.  We need to find ways to bring First Nations fully into the circle of economic prosperity, and to realize the potential in First Nations youth.  We need to break the cycle of poverty and ill-health in our big cities, and to solve the seemingly intractable problems like drug use and homelessness.  Innovation is needed here too—big ideas, original thinking, a rejection of the status quo.    15  Such challenges demand innovative thinking by every sector of society, working together for the common good.  UBC is doing its part there too; but that’s a subject for another day!  Thank you.
