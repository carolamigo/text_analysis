In June,as we rushed to complete the Annual Report^  prepare for the General Meeting and Elections, and  get our booth of information displays, posters, T-  Shirts, etc. ready for Kits Day, we promised ourselves that things would slow down a bit during the  summer.  But they didn't!  Staff members have worked on VSW posters for city  buses and community centres, feminist notepaper and  yet more T-Shirts.  We now have an Audio-Visual Library of video tapes  and slides which members are invited to make use of.  Also our research library of clippings, articles,  pamphlets, and books has been organized and expanded  Groups have continued to meet almost every night at  the office (some nights we have had as many as three  different groups!) and Orientation Meetings and Open  Houses have been well attended. In addition four  School Women Workshops were held at the office.  VSW members have participated in establishing a Vancouver Chapter of CARAL (Canadian Association for  Repeal of Abortion Laws) and there,,have been two  rallys and a vigil, during the summer.  Staff members have travelled to Kaslo to set up a VSW information booth at the Women's Festival, to Penticton to  speak at the conference there, and to Ottawa to join NAC  in lobbying government officials.  The Ombuds staff has been extremely busy counselling and  preparing briefs but still managed to monitor three Human  Rights hearings and the PWA Flight Attendants trial.  On the Federal scene it was good to see the Human Rights  Code introduced in the House, the Omnibus Bill receive  third reading, and the Justice Minister at last propose  amendments to the laws dealing with rape.  There have been pleasant surprises when members and interested women from throughout the province and from  across Canada and even from England, Wales and Japan  have dropped in to see us.  And then of course, there were the daily happenings,  the odd party and the sunshine.  A good summer!  Tand now it's autumn.  We'll get off to a good start-with our General Meeting on September 16th. Gene Errington will speak to  us about the IWY Conference she attended in Mexico  City. All members should plan to attend. The June  General Meeting was well attended and everyone had  a good time talking with old and new friends. Let's  do it again!  We will be trying to devise some new sources for  funds so that we can expand VSW services. Any ideas?  And of course we will be increasing the pressure on  the governments to do something about the abortion  Land rape laws, women and credit, equal pay for work  mpf  equal value, affirmative action, the Canadian  Pension Plan, community of property, maternity protection, etc. etc.  Information booklets are being prepared on issues  of vital concern to women such as marriage and credit.  New groups are forming and old ones are continuing. With  schools opening, speaking engagements will be filling up  our calendar again. Our A-V Library and new projector will  be a big help.  And our IWY Community Outreach Project begins in the Fall!  This status of women learning program is funded by the Sec"  retary of State and will run from mid September to mid December. Two VSW staff members will work through 12 community  centres in the Lower Mainland presenting a lecture-discussion  series. We will share resource materials and information on  such topics as daycare, employment orientation, women's health  needs, sex-role stereotyping, and government programs for  women. The program grew out of the tremendous reponse to the  speaking engagements done in the past year by VSW staff.  And of course there will be the daily happenings, the odd  party and rain.  Hello Autumn. Jo Lazenby It is difficult to know where to  start when describing this month's  book but the title should give you  some idea. Male Chauvinism!  How  It Works by Michael Korda (published  1973, Random House of Canada Ltd.  Toronto).  If that doesn't grab you  by the throat, try the chapter headings:  The Stigma of Success, The  Domestic Chauvinist, and The Psychology of Serfdom* My favourite,  A Day in the Office, has down pat  the put-downs of the women staff  and their built-in ability,, to do  much putting down of their own.  Anyone who has ever worked in an  office will know the scenario when  a woman coming to see a male executive to suggest, complain, make  waves, encounters the great man  showing every sign of fatigue and  stress from the responsibilities of  his position. This is to discourage her from adding to his burdens  and has the further "benefit" of  appealing to her womanly heart and  create sympathy for her man. Korda  calls this play, which is a good  deal more subtle and intricate than  described here, as "one of the central weapons in the arsenal of male  chauvinism" and I rather think he  is right. Conditioned as many  women are, this attitude "is usu-.  ally sufficient to disarm (them),  it .acts as an invisible screen  against requests, demands and complaints  "  This book, like Hamlst, is full or  quotations.  Here are a couple I  especially enjoyed:  "Changes can  be made, are being made, and it is  important for women to know about  them, and for men to realise that  the strength of the Womens' Movement does not lie in the extremists,  but in the mass of women who are  determined to win a opportunity to  compete equally with men." Right -  on.  We are all familiar with the method  of taking something a man has said  about women and reversing the sexes,  so to speak - Korda does this with  remarks about Negroes and Jews too  s  exist  Smorgasbord  - which brings us to the second  quote. Korda was present at a meeting with "two famous lawyers" one  male fiftyish and one female thirty-  ish.  On being introduced the man  said "Listen, you should have told  me she was a great looking chick"  and Korda to his credit "could  clearly see why it was offensive.  Would she have said to me, "You  didn't tell me that he was really  well-hung for an old man?"  Not very delicate perhaps but it's  time so many women stopped being  automatically polite and worried  about hurting someone's feelings.  God save us all from rude and aggressive people of any sex, but if women  accept this type of "compliment" with  a smile they have only themselves to  blame if they are treated like halfwits.  Even Korda, obviously sympathetic and  trying to understand, makes his mistakes and admits to a chest beating  virile 'rescue' of a woman from the  attentions of a harmless drunk, without asking if she wished to be rescued or, perish the thought, could take  care of herself.  It was an instinctive knee-jerk reaction to protect  "his woman" and as such perhaps understandable.  Not understandable at all  is an article written by Korda (in  an earlier publication) in which in  the same paragraph he uses the words  "girls" and "women" (about the same  group of people) using "girls" when  describing some female procedure and  "women" when referring to some masculine action, which all goes to show  how hard it is going to be for those  men who haven't even recognised the  problem and seem unable or perhaps  unwilling to listen.  I strongly recommend this book, although if you are of an excitable  disposition I would avoid having anything breakable within reach when  reading. You might try your local  library or Duthies said they would be  glad to order it from the publishers  at no extra cost. After you read it  give it to your husband/son/father/  daughter/lover/ whatever, and I guarantee some spirited discussion around  the old hot stove. One word of caution, Korda lives and works in KSv York,  £ City not comparable with anywhere in  British Columbia, not even Vancouver.  Not yet anywayo  - Margaret Nicholls  Education by  Experience  I recently maintained our watching  brief at a Human Rights Board of  Inquiry hearing, and momentarily  considered the futility of legislation in the Human Rights field.  Most people don't occupy their  spare time reading statutes, and  perhaps unfortunately, most of our  citizens are more committed to day-  to-day operation of their affairs  than to the equalization of opportunity amongst all the members of  our society.  Education must always  be the fundamental modifier in a  democratic system, for only through  change of thinking can change occur  on a meaningful or permanent degree.  But education can be a difficult  objective to achieve, experience  being always the best teacher.  It  is for education by experience that  legislation is required. People  discriminate unfairly primarily  because it is the easiest method of  dealing with a particular problem,  whether the problem is an emotional  one taking place in the bigot or an  on-the-job problem like "no Johns",  the discrimination we consider unfair  takes place because exclusion of the  whole class of people who force  resolution of the problem is easier  than dealing with the problem itself.  Legislation can never end such exclusion, it can only make what was  the easy solution more difficult and  alternative solutions comparatively  easy, whether or not a particular  complainant is able to prove a case  six months later, relying almost  exclusively on his or her own credibility, if a Human Rights Officer  has occupied a significant amount  of someone's time with investigation  and attempts at settlement, alternatives to discrimination must necessarily have gained in appeal. Failure  to settle and consider an alternative  such as rehiring or renting to the  complainant will result in even more  time preparing for an Inquiry, and  may necessitate the expediture of  money in attempting to win a case  before that Board. Again, alternatives to exclusion appear increasingly appealing   If at any time, the alternative solution is implemented, at least the  opportunity for education by experience exists.  It is only when the  bigot, the sexist, the ignorant can  be presented with evidence of the  falsity of their perceptions that  those perceptions can change.  Contempt prior to investigation  remains today as in Herbert Spencer's  day that principle which is a bar  against all information, proof against  all arguments, and which cannot fail  to keep a (wo)man in everlasting  ignorance.  - Lee Masters  BOOKS  Women of British Columbia is one of  the new four volume series of books  on 'resources of British Columbia'  published by Hancock House Publishers Ltd. and due for release early  this fall.

The July 26th performance of three  plays by Hot Flashes Theatre, "Egg-  tooth", "Betty Windsor's Blue Plate  Special", and Sounds Like a Carnival",  was well attended and received at the  Equinox Book Store on West 4th Avenue.  "Eggtooth" by Peggy Bellerive was executed simply and clearly" Three  woman friends come together and express their particular need for personal fulfilment. Each woman's  lifestyle represents an equally  'real' situation: Helene, a PhD in  Anthropology, finds her work stifled  by a demanding baby and an uncooperative husband; Carolyn, a secretary, unsuccessful in her search  for Mr. Right, seeks to find the  answer in a never ending stream of  psychiatrists; and Linda, a housewife, happily expects her second  child, as long as its arrival does  not conflict with her plans to take  a weaving course. Linda's contentment appears to be complete, however  one questions this when informed of  her husband's affair with Carolyn.  In addition Linda remains closed as to  her personal life by not participating  in the women's discussion of their  needs. The dialogue between Helene  and Carolyn painfully shows their inability to understand one another's  situation which each views as being  less important than her own. This  emotionally charged encounter with  —noi pijjikj-  no exchange of support or compassion  afforded no solutions to existing  problems and is indicative of our  common struggles being coped with  on an individual basis.  Carolyn Bell's "Betty Windsor's  Blue Plate Special" presented the  resolution of a dilemma in a light-  hearted and humorous manner. Ruth,  the main character, had wrestled with  inner turmoil over her sexual preference for many years. Through the  support and encouragement of her  friends Dawn and Vette, a lesbian  couple, Ruth comes to terms with her  diverse feelings of sexuality.  Ruth's  previous lover, Rob, is not developed in the play but used merely as  a prop expressing the inability of  society to fathom the concept of  lesbianism. The play becomes superficial when Ruth meets Meg and an  affair is initiated which avoids an  in-depth look at lesbianism because  it does not take into consideration  the realities of love and commitment.  Witty dialogue and great acting made  the play most enjoyable.  The third play, "Sounds Like a Carnival" by Nora Randall was fun.  A  trialogue, written in rhyming verse,  it takes place on a pedistrian walk-  ~way on U.S. Interstate Highway 494.  Three attitudes of pessimism, optimism and indifference are expressed  about a multitude of topics such as  pollution, Vietnam, the peace movement, industrialism, and alienation.  Due to the quick paced verse and diversity of subject matter much content  was missed. However any loss of meaning was not important according to  author Ms. Randall who said " if it  made any sense I have failed".  Hot Flashes Theatre grew out of the  UoB.C. Department of Theatre and is  dedicated to presenting original  scripts by new playwrights. The  group is concerned with the often  distorted view of women presented  in theatre. Their plays are about  women here and now and cover a variety  of issues; motherhood, politics,  abortion, and sexuality. They are not  interested in presenting a bleak, dismal portrayal of women in society but  rather one that is realistic, honest,  and often comical.  Currently funded  by Opportunities for Youth, they have  been touring the city, Lower Mainland,  and Vancouver Island.  - Judy Bourne  NELLIE  In Times Like These, Nellie McClung,  University of Toronto Press. $3.50.  I was very pleased to see the recent  reprinting of Nellie McClung's In  Times Like These. This feminist classic was originally published in 1915  in the United States.  In 1972 a  grant from the Canada Council enabled University of Toronto Press to  make Nellie McClung's ideas and wit  available to modern Canadians"  In Times Like These has been criticized, analyzed and reviewed many  times. This edition is preceded  by an excellent Introduction written  by Veronica Strong-Boag which provides a superb analysis of Nellie—  her personal history, her strengths  and weaknesses, and the political  situation against which she fought.  Therefore I am reluctant to discuss  those aspects, for I ean only quote  Ms. Strong-Boag, and I think it is  far more effective to simply strongly  recommend the Introduction. My remarks will concentrate on what In  Times Like These meant to me.  , The suffragists and suffragettes are  our closest sisters, historically  and politically. Nellie McClung's  book creates a strong sense of sisterhood and emphasizes the power,  strength, and continuity of the  Women's Movement. Nellie assumes  that feminism is inevitable, that  women are superior, and that we will  succeed in building a better world.  We realize that time has not yet  proved her right, and that her view  is based on "the liberal's belief  in human perfectibility and a social  Christian's confidence in the force  of Good." (Introduction, Veronica  Strong-Boag. p. 20).  But we also  realize that she was a product of  her times, her class, and her education, and that her view cannot be  expected to be relevant today.  Nonetheless, her courage, humour and  intelligence are relevant, and provide  an excellent source of strength and  energy for feminists.  Basically,  reading Nellie is like having one's  batteries recharged.  Nellie is extremely clever.  So  clever that she was almost always  able to out think, out talk and out  manoeuvre her adversaries, and never  had to resort to acts of defiance  or disobedience.  She believed that  "mental activity is just as natural  for the woman peeling potatoes as it  is for the man behind the plow, and  a little thinking will not hurt the  quality of work in either case."  However, she had noticed that "the  world had never been partial to the  thinking woman," in fact, it seemed  to be a "haunting fear of mankind—  that the advancement of women will  sometime, someway, someplace, interfere with some man's comfort." Her  quick mind sees right through the  red herring issues of her day—  "chivalry,", she maintains., " is a  poor substitute for justice if one  cannot have both."  In Times Like These is a very entertaining and informative social  document. It provides an excellent  presentation of the position of the  Canadian suffragists. In closing,  I wish to share Nellie's suffrage  prayer:  "From plague, pestilence and famine,  from battle, murder, sudden death,  and all forms of cowlike contentment,  Good Lord, deliver us!"

Over 100 people marched Saturday,  August 9th in the CARAL Rally calling  for the release of Dr. Henry Morgentaler. The march began at Victory  Square and moved along Hastings Street  and up Granville Street to the Courthouse at Granville and Burrard.  Speaker Lisa Hobbs, a Vancouver Sun  associate editor, told the rally Morgentaler has "become the centre of a  great and unequal battle" and "if we  hold our tongues we are all destined  to suffer similar tyranny."  du.iVd.  Hilda Thomas, U.B.C. English instructor, stated "the defence of Dr. Morgentaler is the defence of all women  in this countryc  The defence of Dr.  Morgentaler is the defence of freedom in this country."  An unscheduled speaker was Attorney-  General Alex Macdonald, who was  snatched out of the crowd and .clutching his Bay shopping bag told the  rally "I think it's a terrible thing  to convict someone who's been acquitted by a jury."  rally  Jo Lazenby read the following endorsement from the Vancouver Status of  Women:  "The Vancouver Status of Women joins CARAL in calling for the immediate release of Dr. Henry Morgentaler from his unjust imprisonment.  Dr. Morgentaler was twice acquitted  by a jury. His imprisonment is a  denial of one of our most fundamental  rights — the right to be tried by a  jury of our peers.  We find it very significant that the  area in which this blow at the foundation of our justice system was  struck is an area that is of such  crucial importance to women.  For  centuries women have had their  choices and opportunities in life  severely restricted by their role of  childbearing.  In recent years improved contraceptive methods have  loosened these restrictions and made  it possible for women to exercise a  greater degree of control over the  direction of their lives. When an unwanted pregnancy occurs because of  ignorance, or carelessness, or ineffective contraceptive methods, a  woman is placed in the position of  losing her control over her body and  her life. How important this sovereignity of self is, can be seen by the  desperate and dangerous risks women  will take in order to preserve it.  Medically safe abortions are a necessary step in combatting this danger  and desperation.  If the government of this country is  truly concerned with equality of opportunity and justice — if it is  truly concerned with a 'just society'  — it must immediately release Dr.  Henry Morgentaler."

Women all over the entire  world, he told us, whether rich or  poor, were the victims of discrimination, and for this reason constituted the largest revolutionary  reserve in the world of today.  By  contrast, the oppressed man who  assumes attitudes of superiority  toward women compromises the possibility of his own progress.  If  women remained outside the revolutionary process they would imprison  themselves for another century in  "the fortress of alienation".  Children must see their mothers not  only as kindly human beings, but as  active ones participating in change.  Fathers should be involved in the  home.  Education based on old prejudice would limit potential. Men  should reflect on their own conduct  and change their traditional attitudes. He said it all, he said it  strongly, he said much that we have  yet to hear from any male politician  in this country, much less the ones  at the top, either from commitment  or political expediency. We were  excited; we forgot for the moment  that the Latins have given us  "machismo"  Development and equality are complementary, he said, and neither  could occur without replacing the  policy of force which still governs relations between states.  WOMEN TO BLAME  Helvi Sipila also spoke.  She is  the highest ranking woman in the  U.N.  She, too, outlined the status of women, but her analysis was  different. Throughout her speech,  like a chorus, she repeated "Who do  I blame for this?  I blame women".  AND EACH TIME SHE WAS APPLAUDED.  Outside pro-abortion demonstrators  were prevented from entering.  CONFERENCE STRUCTURE  The conference itself was divided  into three parts, meeting simultaneously—a plenary session and two  working committees.  For all but  the last day, the plenary was taken  up with statements from each country  on the position of their women; by  noon of the first day we were behind  schedule.  Each country had three  seats in the plenary hall, but only  one vote.  Twenty percent of the  delegates were men; women, however,  in most cases presented their  country's statements - often they  were the wives of leading statesmen-  immediately christened "wifey-poos"  by the press. From these statements  it appeared there was very little  sexism in the world, and what there  was, was fast being eradicated.  There was, however, lots of imperialism,, fascism, racism, neo-colon-  ialism, colonialism, and apartheid.  Certain countries - the U.S.S.R.,  Cuba, Vietnam, etc., were embraced  by their friends as they left the  podium.   Valentina Tereshkova,  the Russian cosmonaut and head of  her delegation, received the most  embraces after a very emotional  and moving speech on disarmament.  Canada did not embrace anybody,  but was herself embraced by the  U.S.A. When Mrs. Rabin of Israel  stood up to speak, the pro-Arab  countries walked out, and went  downstairs to watch her speech on  television. One country extolled  the virtues of family life. Another regretted the passing of  polygamy.  IWY... mexico city  The real work of the conference  was done in the committees.  Committee One dealt with the draft  World Plan of Action, a 45 page  document encompassing everything  from political action to nutrition,  and designed to set guidelines  for national action over the next  10 years, with the goal of achieving the objectives of International Women's Year.  Each country had  one seat and one vote; Sylva  Gelber represented Canada.  The  committee dealt with over 200  amendments, each of ehich had to  be translated and printed in the  five working languages of the U.N.  In the end, only the first two  chapters were revised, and the  rest of the Plan was adopted as  it was and sent to the plenary.  The second committee was concerned with obstacles to equality,  the role of women in development,  and the role of women in achieving world peace. One seat, one  vote per country.  Freda Paltiel  represented Canada. The committee  dealt with some 600 resolutions,  and amendments finally bringing  twenty-eight to the plenary session.  Both committees and the plenary  went on til midnight or later most  days:  the support staff worked  around the clock translating and  printing resolutions and amendments.  They were understaffed.  It was a cheap conference - only  half as much money as the population conference in'Bucharest.  That was the settingo The press  has already covered the politics.  . It was certainly true that men were  most visible whan there was most  to be discussed. Twenty percent of  1500 delegates were men, but it  only needed two or three men in a  delegation to effectively control  the voting.  External Affairs, or  its equivalent, steered much of the  debate, either directly by being in  the chair, or by being at the elbow  of the woman who was there.  This,  I gather, is no different than any  other UN conference, since it is  foreign policy that is at stake.  THE NEW ECONOMIC ORDER  Much has also been written about  the split between those countries  who wished to stick to the agenda,  and those who wished to scrap the  agenda in favour of a discussion of  the New Economic Order, a Declaration already adppted at the May 1974  Sixth Special Session of the United  Nations General Assembly.  It was  in this debate that the women's  movement was subjected to the most  sophisticated and subtle kind of  pressure.  The New Economic Order deals with  the redistribution of wealth and  the sovereignty of member states  over their own resources, without  which, we were told, the status of  women could not be improved.  How  could we disagree, and yet how could  we give up our one chance to discuss  women's concerns on an International  level? The New Economic Order has  already been adopted; there will be  many other arenas to debate it; we  wanted our turn.  But it's not just that simple—not  just a matter of priorities or  whether we again step aside for  something "more important" or wheth  er it is true or not that development and equality cannot be separated. The problem, it seems to me,  that we have to address ourselves  to is where women stand in the formation and implementation of ideologies, of how women as a group relate to the formation of a free and  egalitarian society.  Sheila  Rowbotham has already pointed out  that changes in the ownership and  organization of production may not  necessarily change the social relations of production, or effect a  revolutionary change in women's  position. Many revolutionary men,  she points out, are not able to cast  off a deep contempt for women, when  they become socialists.  OUR ONLY HOPE  Some years ago, Margaret Fuller  expressed the hope that we would  have the sympathy of "men who  loved liberty" but felt that despite their acquiesence the only  hope lay in the mobilization of  women•  Somehow this was reflected in  Mexico.  It was the Cuban,  Mexican, whoever, men that spoke.  When Sylva Gelber asked that we  stick to the agenda, African  women approached her after and  said they wished to support her  but had to follow the policies  of their governments. One woman  from an underdeveloped country  told the press "I was told to  follow the lead of the Committee  of Seventy-seven (the third  world countries)."  TO BEGIN A DEEPER ANALYSIS  In spite of all this, I feel the  Conference was a success, given  what it set out to do. We have a  World Plan of Action. We have  some twenty-eight resolutions,  dealing, among other things, with  prostitution and torture, with the  position of rural women, with the  role of women in development, with  affirmative action within the UN.  We have, at least, our government's  moral committment to these resolutions.  It was useful, too, if it  causes us to begin a deeper analysis of our position in society.  Canada did all right.  Her position  paper, which was criticized by some  as being blah, at least came out  very strongly on the role of women  in development, stating that women  must be among the architects of  development, that they must be seen  as a target group of development  projects, that they must be among  the evaluators.  This, surely, is  of equal interest to women in third  world countries, as it is to our  own women.  Sylva Gelber and Freda  Paltiel slugged it out phrase by  phrase and hour after hour in  committee, trying to get meaningful resolutions into the plenary  session, and on several occasions  reconciled polarized positions.  We were all given dolls.  These are  rag dolls made, we were told, by  the native women of Mexico, which,  if they were paid for it must have  represented a small financial bonanza.  I really like my doll.  Some  women, I understand, did not want  to be given a doll. What they had  really wanted was an electric train.  - Gene Errington.

This  group will work on the same basis  as Letter Lobby in that one doesn't  have to live in town to belong,  regular mailings will be done to  all group members regarding sexist  ads, letters to be written, lobby  action to be taken.  If you or your  group are interested in being a part  of MEDIA ACTION LOBBY please call  or write Karen Richardson at the  office.  FEMINISM & RELATIONSHIPS  This group has met 4 times, and we'v e  had as many as 18 people at one  meeting. We are continuing to meet  every second Monday night at 8 PM  and although we are not in need of  expansion, we really won't turn  anyone away.  Perhaps, if enough  people are interested a new group  could begin. The purpose of the  group is to take a look at how being  feminists has changed the relationship we have with the men in our  lives.  Each week we try to give the  meeting a different focus by having  various members bring an article  to read that will help stimulate  discussion. To date we have had  a terrific talk on Jungian psychology, another one on problems  of raising non-sexist kids, and we  are at present debating whether  or not there are innate differences  between men and women.  This group  is not a C.R. group, but it does  involve personal committment.  See  calendar at back of paper for  meeting dates in September.  AUDIO VISUAL LIBRARY  '  This is a reminder that we. lave  20 different "Woman Alive" video  tapes in our library and these half  hour tapes are available on a loan  basis to any interested group.  The only cost to you is postage.  Leslie Dixon has been listing  the available tapes in the last two  issues of KINESIS and is completing  a catalogue now. Write or call the  office for more information.  C.A.R.A.L.  The Canadian Ass'n for Repeal of  Abortion Law will have its next  meeting on Wed., Sept 3 at 7:30 PM  here at VSW offices.  If you are  interested in being a part of this  important lobby/action/petition  group please join them on that  date. See page 4 for coverage  of the CARAL march & rally held  August 9.  AT  Bissell  STAFF STUFF  Our summer Secretary of State grant  ends shortly and we will be saying  good-bye to students Sheera Waisman,  Leslie McDonald and Leslie Dixon, all  'of whom did a terrific job with artwork,  high school workshops and the audio  visual library respectively. Aside  from that, they were terrific people  to have around the office and things  will be very empty without them.  Thanks to the three of you, for  sharing your knowledge/perceptions/  laughter/work with the rest of us  for the past 4 months.  Glinda Sutherland, VSW staff person  since 1973 and Ombudswoman since  January of this year resigned from  ombudsduty August 15 to take a long  rest and holiday prior to her  impending marriage in Npvember. Her  expertise-and special talents are  already missed, although she assures  us that she will make regular  appearances on Woman Alive for us,  and intends to be an active VSW  volunteero Watch next months paper  for a "wrap-up" interview with  Glindac A new ombudstaffer has  been hired, her name is Lee Masters,  perhaps familiar to many of you as  she has been a VSW member for several  years and has done several Woman  Alive shows and Kinesis articles.  Lee has brought in a huge kitchen  table to use as a desk and already  has it covered with officious looking  documents like the Criminal Code!  Welcome to the fray, Lee!  Jo Lazenby. resident humorist, made  a grand entrance into the world  of public speaking by addressing the  Chilliwack Rotary Club last week, and  also spoke to the CARAL rally Aug. 9.  Diana Bissell was thrilled to bits to  be asked to fly to Penticton and  speak to the Penticton Women's  Centre on Aug. 21, also went on  Radio CKOK's morning open line  program the same day. Miriam  Gropper, aside from becoming VSW's  new Ombudswoman, attended the mini-  conference of western Rape Relief  Centres to work on a brief to be  presented to Otto Lang regarding  amendments to his proposed rape  law changes. Nadine, Jo, Diana  and the 2 Leslies attended the  Social Service Workers Conference  on Aug. 8. All staff attended the  C.A.R.A.L. rally Aug 9 and it was  terrific to see so many other VSW  members there.  LETTER LOBBY  Letter Lobby is in action again  after a brief summer layoff. The  first meeting will be Fri., Sept 12  at l-:30 a.m. here in the office.  Anyone can be a part of Letter Lobby-  its not hard to join or paricipate.  All committee members receive a basic  information kit, and every month we  send out information on issues of  concern, suggestions for letter  writing to the government, and fill  you in on responses we have had.  This group doesn't have many meetings,  we depend on our members to write  the letters at their own speed  although we always look forward  to communication from them on their  activities.  If you would like to  be a part of some lobbying action  this fall, call or write VSW and  ask to be a part of LETTER LOBBY.  WOMAN ALIVE  Our weekly television program has  been moved to WEDNESDAY evenings at  9 PM and you will be able to see  the first program of the season  on Wed., Sept 24. There will be  a meeting here at the office on  MONDAY, SEPT 22 .at 8 PM for all  those people interested in being  part of a television committee.  If you have any ideas for programs,  or if you would like to "do" a  few shows please come along to the  meeting—we NEED you!  KINESIS  Once again the call goes out to  find women interested in helping  out with the newspaper. Jo is  committed to putting out a 20 page  paper each month and that involves  a lot of work.  Especially typing.  Extra special thanks go to JOAN from  the Volunteer Bureau and our own  JUDY for all the typing work they  did this month, but Jo is still  in desperate need of another typist,  someone who can sit down at the IBM  selectric during the day (or who  would be willing to make arrangements  to come in during the evening) and  type out articles that have been  submitted. The work usually builds  up during the first 3 weeks of each  month and the pressure of trying to  get everything typed, laid out,  printed, folded, stamped and mailed  as much BEFORE the 1st of each month  as possible (so you, our members, can  read the news while its hot!) has Jo  in perpetual motion. Would you like  to help slow her down?  Come to the  next KINESIS meeting, Tues., Sept 9  at 7:30 PM or call Jo Lazenby at the  office.  ORIENTATION/OPEN HOUSE  Want to know about what VSW does  and how you can help? Drop in for an  Orientation Meeting, Thurs, Sept 11  at 8 pm or come to Open House, Thurs.,  Sept 25 at 8 pm. Everyone Welcome.  C.R. GROUPS  Several people have signed up to be  part of a new consciousness raising  group—are there any others out there?  If so, please join us on Thursday,  September 18 at 8 PM in the office,  as that is the date of the beginning  of VSW's newest CR group. There will  be a person experienced in C.R. to  lead the group off on this first  meeting and resource material will  be available for people to read also. letter      lobby  Our Letter Lobby this month is focussing  on the need for changes in the provincial Maternity Protection Act. The  following letter was sent to Labour  Minister King at the end of August  by VSW President Nancy Conrod. The  Letter Lobby Committee suggests that  you read Nancy's letter and write a  follow-up one of your own, supporting  Nancy's suggestions0  It needn't be  a long letter, just something like  this: "Dear Sir—I wish to" convey my  full support of recent statements  made by VSW President Nancy Conrod  concerning the need for changes in  B.C.'s Maternity Protection Act."  You can synopsize the comments Nancy  makes in her letter, or add a few  irate words of your own.  Send a  carbon copy of it to your own  M.L.A. too..Both letters should be  addressed to the person concerned,  c/o Parliament Buildings, Victoria.  Honourable William S. King  Minister of Labour  Parliament Buildings  VICTORIA, B.C.  Dear Sir:  When the Legislature reconvenes  this fall, it would be most appropriate for the Government to  honour the closing months of  International Women's Year by  introducing amendments to the  Maternity Protection Act.  The Act badly needs amendment.  We, at Vancouver Status of Women  have been urging changes in it  for years.  At a minimum a new Act must contain the following provisions:  1. A guaranteed leave of at  least 17 weeks, to be scheduled before and/or after  birth at the mother's choice,  so as to allow maximum use of  Unemployment Insurance maternity benefits.  2. A complete prohibition upon  firing or lay-offs solely  because of pregnancy or requests for maternity leave.  3. A guarantee that when the  mother returns to work she  will be placed in the same  or similar position to that  she held before the leave, at  no less than the rate of pay  she received before the leave.  4. A guarantee that maternity  leave will not be considered  a break in service, for purposes of seniority, benefit  entitlement, pension plans, etc.  5. A guarantee that a mother who  chooses to work until late in  pregnancy may do so as long as  she is physically capable of  performing her job.  6. A guarantee that a mother who  wishes to return to work soon  after birth may do so as long  as she is physically capable of  performing her job.  (In other  words, abolish the present prohibition upon a mother's working for six weeks after birth.)  A Maternity Protection Act with  these provisions would have the  support of Women's Groups throughout the Province. And, I am sure  that it would have the support of  all parties in the Legislature.  On June 25, Mrs. Jordan expressed  her belief that the Province needs  new maternity protection legislation and such support undoubtedly  exists in the other parties and  among the independents.  Introduction of a sound Maternity  Protection Act would be one of the  finest ways for the Government to  observe International Women's Year  and unanimous adoption of such an  act would be one of the finest ways  for the Legislature to observe the  year.  - Nancy D.

UNDERCOVER      MEN-  Have you looked into men's underwear  lately? Perhaps I should rephrase  that - what I meant was have you  seen the goodies offered in the  menswear departments of the most  stolid of stores, including the  one I was in, in. Victoria of all  places.  Shorts in every conceivable design, colour and pattern  designed "with the modern man in  mind." This particular store calls  England its Motherland which may  account for all these frivolities,  for it is generally acknowledged  that the Brits are way up in the  top ten when it comes to decadence.  Even their political scandals  feature lecherous aristocrats  and expensive call-girls rather  than breaking and entering or,  heaven help us, digging holes in  a harbour. Does this mean then  that the arrival of the nifty  Knickers in Victoria is a sign  that we are moving closer to the  British way of life with its economic chaos, omnipotent trade  Unions, 25% inflation and the loss  of an Empire?  (Ask the Romans about  decadence and losing an Empire -  they'll tell you).  But this is Canada and we Canadians are made of  sterner stuff right? - wrong! In  the Eaton's catalogue right alongside the longjohns there they are -  shorts of every colour of the rainbow, and Sears offers a snappy  little number with nylon mesh panels  called The European Look ( I told  you so).  Of course one can find significance  in anything if one puts one's mind  to it but to feminists it seems to  me there really maybe something  here.  Since the dawn of time women  have been pictured as glamourous  sex objects in their underwear;  media type women that is since nobody bothers much about real women  who tend to stick out in the wrong  places and Wonder-bra can't do a  thing about the shape they are in.  Men, on the other hand, have generally been made to look foolish  when revealed sans culotte.  The  guy losing his pants is as old  and guaranteed a guffaw as the  pratfall, which is its first cousin.  But now with all these glamourous  underpinnings, perhaps the balance  is shifting and men are going to  become more sexy in their Stanfields  and perhaps women less so in theirs,  and we shall all meet together in  the middle of the road and walk off  hand in hand into the sunset.

A similar conference  is going to take place in Toronto this October, with more  than 100 women expected to attend  What is it about wages for housework as a perspective and as a  demand that has brought together  black women and white, lesbian  and straight, mothers and non-  mothers, married and single, who  are all saying the same thing —  "We are all housewives - we all  want wages for housework!"  More and more women are seeing  that the struggles women have made  for daycare, equal pay, against  sexist advertising and children's  books, while changing some of the  conditions of our work, have not  changed the work itself.  Women  still bear the burden of child-  rearing and housework. We are  still channelled into women's  jobs outside the home — jobs  which are usually housework in a  socialized setting (medical care  and education etc. used to be provided in the home by the woman  Now we get a measly wage for doing"  the same work outside the home).  Despite the struggles the women's  movement has made, our situation  as women has not fundamentally  changed. We are still housewives.  We are all housewives.  And more and more of us are seeing  that it won't change until we go  back to the roots of our powerless-  ness as women and attack that: the  unpaid labour that all women perform  as housewives. And when we talk  about housework we don't mean only  the cooking, cleaning and childcare,  although most certainly that, but the  whole role all women are forced to  perform — of sex object, tension  manager, unpaid prostitute, servant.  It is a role some of us can avoid to  varying degrees, by refusing marriage,  getting a "male" job etc., but as  long as we're women, we can't avoid  it entirely.  WAGES FOR  HOUSEWORK  we want to have children, a second job  outside the home etc. etc.  Since the Toronto Wages for Housework  Committee began organizing a little  more than six months ago, the response  has been incredible. We have talked  with all different kinds of women all  over the place — many of them considered  to be "unorganizable" by sections of the  Women's Movement, because they didn't  see how their liberation could possibly  lie in getting a paid job outside the  home. All of these women are connecting  their lack of power to their lack of a  wage for their housework.  On May Day we held a rally in City Hall  Square as the kick-off of our wages for  housework campaign.  Eight different  women spoke about why they want wages for  housework — a full-time housewife, lesbian, student, welfare mother etc.  (The  speeches have been reprinted in a pamphlet along with photos, songs and leaflets, available from the Committee for  home  THE ORIGINS OF HOUSEWIFERY   AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?  It is distinctly human that we look  around at the existing order of  things and assume that it is "natural"   that things must always have been  the way they appear today.  For  those of us engaged in efforts to  change women's place such an attitude  is deadly for surely it is pointless to struggle against what has  always been, against "destiny." And  more important, if we don't understand  how things came to be as they are,  it is difficult to know the best way  to go about changing them.  It is with all of this in mind that  we should examine how women have become  housewives:  for although we have been  getting married, and having children  and although the nuclear family has  been with us perhaps since the beginning of human society, women have  been housewives only since the development of a very special kind of  nuclear family.  That    where one  person—an adult male     ^s his  home to sell his labour   3 works for  wages) at a work place that he does  not own while being serviced at home  maker  And the only way we can begin to fight  against this role, this women's work,  is by demanding a wage for all women  from the State. Once we're paid for  this work — it means that we are workers just like other sectors of society.  And like other workers, with the power  that having our own money gives us, we  can then begin to fight against that  work.  No longer will our 14 and 16 hour  days be taken for granted, our constant  self-sacrifice and giving to others —  at such enormous costs to ourselves.  We will have the power to begin to determine some of the conditions of our  lives — many of us for the first time.  Whether or not we want to live with a  man. Whether or not we want to put our  children into daycare. Whether or not  75c). On the same weekend as our rally  was taking place, sisters were holding  wages for housework rallies in Los Angeles, New York, England, Germany and Italy.  We are building a campaign for wages for  housework internationally to say that we  ate all born and raised to be housewives,  but by fighting for wages for housework  we won't be housewives for much longer.  — Frances Gregory  Toronto, Wages for Housework Committee.  Graphic from leaflet prepared by  Toronto Wages for Housework Committee.  For more information on wages for  housework contact the committee at:  P.O. Box 38, Station E, Toronto,Ontario  HOUSEWIFERY  currently developing Third World countries the move of families from the  countryside to the city sees the removal of women from productive activity and dramatic losses in their  status and even of their physical  well-being.  Of course, the development of the  industrial nuclear family took place  in stages.  Early in the history of  capitalist development all members  of the family had to work to provide  simple subsistence.  Women and children were expected to earn wages sufficient to sustain themselves, and  wages to men were based on the assumption that they did so.  As recently  as 1842 in the United States a law  was passed forbidding children under  12 years from working more than ten  hours each day. The struggle for a  ten hour working day for adults was  won only in 1871.  It is only in the  last two generations and largely  because of workers' struggles over  the conditions and hours of work that  first children and then women were  withdrawn from the labour force.  Consequently, today it appears that  men earn wages sufficient to support  these newly unproductive members of  their families.  In fact, this is far  from the truth.  It may no longer be  necessary for all family members to  earn incomes, but the wages men earn  pp|£: are based on the assumption that  ~'c^  someone a wife provides vital  >'      services to them services- that they  would otherwise have to purchase.  brief  The National Council of Women recently presented its annual brief to the  Cabinet.  Among other things, they  called for having "housework and volunteer work included in the Canadian  Classification and Dictionary of occupations."

Although society pays sentimental lip service to the view  that 'the woman behind the man'  performs a valuable function, her  day-to-day activities, however strenuous, are not designated as 'work'  in the sense of contributing to the  gross national product.  The way our national accounting system is set up, if a woman wants her  work to count as 'work,' she has to  go out and work for someone else, including even, ironically, doing someone else's housework. The work she  does in her own home for her own  family simply doesn't qualify."  - Dian Cohen, Montreal Economist  Montreal Star, June 11, 1973  "I want a wife who will take care of  my physical needs.  I want a wife who  will keep my house clean. A wife who  will pick up after my children, a  wife who will pick up after me.  I  want a wife who will keep my clothes  clean, ironed, mended, replaced when  need be, and who will see to it that  my personal things are kept in their  proper place so that I can find what  I need the minute I need it.  I want  a wife who cooks the meals, a wife -  who is a good cook.  I want a wife  who will plan the menus , do the necessary grocery shopping, prepare the  meals, serve them pleasantly, and then  do the cleaning up while I do my studying.  I want a wife who will care for  me when I am sick and sympathize with  my pain and loss of time from school.  I want a wife to go along when our  family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and  my children when I need a rest and a  change of scene."  - Judy Syfers, 1971  "Why I Want a Wife"  by women—housewives—who do not work  for a wage.  This kind of family has  developed along with capitalist industrialization.  Everywhere and at all times that capitalism has grown and evolved the  position of women has changed critically; they have everywhere lost their  status as partners in production and  have been absorbed into the privacy  and isolation of their households.  What's more, it is startling to consider how recently these changes have  taken place.  In 17th century England  the development of capitalism saw the  withdrawal of women from commerce  where they were often important in  family enterprises, a general reduction in education for girls and women,  and an overall loss of status and  opportunity.  In Newfoundland it has  been only the last 50 years or so  since most households were centres  of production: women, men and children worked at the fishery in boats  and with gear, stages, flakes, etc.  that they themselves owned.  And in  This on the face of it may not seem  so extraordinary.  But stop and think  about it.  The wages that a company  pays to its workers must be enough  to provide subsistence and to reproduce the worker when he gets "used  up." That is, wages must provide  workers with food, shelter, clothing  and also enough to birth, rear and  educate the next generation of workers.  In fact, a lot of these costs are borne  privately by women in long hours of  work at home, in forgone education,  in loss of pay and seniority during  child bearing years, and often in  careers forgone altogether.  In short,  the wages that men receive really presupposes that they receive many services  for "free." Of course, these services  aren't really free it only appears  so because no money changes hands, and  because women labour alone, privately  and in isolation. Now the services  women perform may seem trivial, but  they are essential: washing, ironing,  making lunches, offering emotional  support, bearing, nurturing,educating  the new generation of workers.  These  are services that our system could not  do without and yet cannot afford to  pay for.  We can visualize how crucial  services really are if we consider  what would happen if they were withdrawn; factories and businesses would  have to shut down, just as certainly  as if their employees went out on  strike.  Under our present economic and political system, women are vital participants, but because they labour so  invisibly, in their own homes, the  enormity of their contribution is hard ■  to see.  Even we who provide these  services do not understand the enormity of their worth:  how many of us  say "oh, I don't work, I'm just a  housewife."  Because we do not understand how  intimately integrated we are as  housewives into the industrial system  it is often not clear to us how to  organize to change things, or it may  keep us from organizing at all.  We  have come to think of demands to improve  the conditions of our work things  like daycare centres, better housing,  etc. as extravagances and as unrelated  to the conditions under which our men  labour.  Sometimes we feel that since  as women we have no real function in  the economy that we should simply  join with men (for example in trade  unions) and support their struggles.  Then as things improve in general;  things will better for women too.  Or, because we do not understand the  true nature of housewifery, we believe  ourselves to be economic parasites  existing at the expense (and pleasure)  of our husbands and sons. This leads  both women and men to mistake the real  issues.  It leads to a belief that sex  is the central problem and that if  only we could overcome male chauvinism  or replace troublesome men supreme  court judges or cabinet ministers with  sympathetic women that all of our  problems would disappear.  (Of course,  the tensions, conflicts and sexual  stereotyping all the things that  keep women and men struggling with  each other are important problems  and should most assuredly be addressed.)  This is just not true.  Understanding the origin and function  of our role as housewife suggests  that we should organize around issues  that most intimately affect the conditions of our labour.  For only in  this way will we be sure to address  the economic conditions that today  are at the heart of our oppression.  - Ellen Antler  Nfld. Status of  Women Council Newsletter, Jan 1975  graphics by Colette French —>■»  from Never Done —1,  / n Siu  quote  "One of the chief effects within patriarchy is to set up one woman against another, in the past creating a  lively antagonism between whore and  matron, and in the present betweeh  career woman and housewife.  One envies the other her "security" and  prestige, while the envied yearns  beyond the confines of respectability for what she takes to be the  other's freedom , adventure, and contact with the great world.  Through  the multiple advantages of the double  standard, the male participates in  both worlds, empowered by his superior social and economic resources to  play the estranged women against each  other as rivals."  from Kate Millet, Sexual Politics  "Each of us thought she was^*v.  a freak ten years ago if  Vp,  she didn't experience that ||^(_  mysterious orgastic fulfilment waxing the kitchen \n,  floors as the commercials^ >V-r^J ■  promised." foe  - Betty Friedan \ n  "Up From The Kitchen>  Floor".

What do these women have in common?  Many things, but perhaps most important  — a feeling of alienation, the conviction that their problems are unique and  due to personal inadequacies, an inability to turn a mass of confused thought  into a statement of need and an action  plan.  Each has thought periodically of getting a job, but none is sure that's the  answer. And so it goes, day after day,  unless ...  There's a Life Planning Centre in the  Vancouver Public Library's downtown  branch.  Run by the University of British  Columbia as part of its women's resource  program, it is a place where women can  start to plug in — to themselves, others  and society.  The centre has a casual atmosphere.  No  appointments required, no receptionist  asking you to state your business, just  walk in.  "A woman can come here without  knowing what she needs to ask," says  Eileen Hendry, a co-ordinator at the  centre.  "Many women come in just to get  information about resources.  They can  browse through the files in our information room, look through the display  material, or talk with one of the staff  about their area of interest."  "Women who want to go a step further can  talk with a counsellor," she continues.  "In each case, we deal with the total  woman. We start with where she is at,  listen to her and try to help her find  what she needs."  "Depending on the discussion, she may  then join a group. Whatever happens, we  are here to offer information and woman-  to-woman support."  What is a typical reaction on joining  a group?  "Shock and surprise," says  Eileen Hendry0  "You start out seeing  others as 'efficient' and unlike yourself, but then you learn they have  shared your experiences and feelings.  When the members of a group start to  relate to each other on a deep interpersonal level, it begins the process  of not feeling alienated and separated,  provides the support you need to develop  some faith in yourself."  "Perhaps it can best be described as  'decent caring'," she continues.  "It's  the kind of thing that so many people  need as they start planning their lives,  the little extra bit of support that a  bureaucratic system cannot provide."  "There is an incredible grapevine system working with women," Eileen Hendry  says. "Information about day care,  good places to live, how to find a job,  services and resources for every problem — the difficulty for many women is  knowing what she needs, where to find it  and now to use it."  "A woman simply needs to find the place  that will link her into that system,"  she addso  For Mary H., Agnes B.,  Margaret L., and many others in Vancouver, the Life Planning Centre could be  the missing link in their lives0  — Marilyn Moreton, WCWN  Life Planning Centre  Room 301, 750 Burrard St.  (Vancouver Public Library)  Vancouver, B.C.

Lynne Pearson,  coordinator of the I.W.Y. secretariat project in B.C., recently  attended an interim meeting of  coordinators from each of the  Provinces and the Yukon. The  I.W.Y. Van has shown real success  in reaching the women of British  Columbia and the Secretariat has  extended its funding by $8,000.  This will enable the Van to continue operating through October  and to attend two Exhibitions in  the Interior. The Van was invited by women in the Okanagan  to attend the Interior Provincial  Exhibition in Armstrong, September 4th. to 7th. Prior to  that it will be at the Lakes District Exhibition in Burns Lake,  August 29th to 31st.  Funds to extend the project were  made available when the Secretariat reduced an originally planned  three-day National meeting in  November to one day. The $8,000  will pay for operation of the Van  for an additional month ($4,000)  and will make it possible for  Lynne Pearson and Sheila Purdy to  work through November, visiting  some of the places missed by the  Van. November will also be spent  pulling together the information,  taped conversations, notes, etc.  gathered by the Van during its  travels. All this data will be  compiled in a resource booklet  which will outline in detail the  concerns, contacts, problems,  media links, etc., community by  community throughout B.C. This  will be the first overview of how  women work, live, function in  B.C. and what their concerns and  needs are. The booklet will be  made available to the public as  well as Government officials and  will be of great value to us!  Gillian Smith will be leaving the  Van at the end of August to attend  Law School at the University of  Victoria.

First, and most important, I emphatically resent the growing drift towards the association of feminism  with socialist politics. Rosemary  Brown, nor any other spokesperson  for the principles of socialism, does  not speak for me, necessarily.  Before you immediately stereotype  me as a narrow-minded far-right extremist blithering on about 'pinkos'  and 'Communist conspiracies', let me  state very clearly that I,too, believe in justice for all — the weak,  the defenceless, the powerless and  the helpless.  But here lies the difference. Surely  it will do no good whatever to exchange one Big Daddy (husband) for  another Big Baddy (government)I  For pity's sake, give us the opportunity to become strong and independent  as individuals. What price victory  if we are swallowed into the maw of  the government—supported; we will  remain helpless and dependent still,  with only a change of masters.  The answer, in my opinion, lies in  education and training. This is,  after all, what we have sacrificed  by our years of service in the home.  In other words, we have lost the  weapons of defence. Government can  assist financially in replacing these  tools; government can also remove  discrimination from the law and taxation policy; but beyond this, government must leave us to do the best we  can with our own abilities in a competitive world. This is the path to  dignity.  The second point I wish to make concerns the inclusion of the problems  of lesbianism in the feminist movement. It is not only acutely embarassing, but has also probably done  more to discourage support for us  than any other factor. It is, after  all, hardly a universal problem; but  one that is strictly personal, or at  least completely separate from those  difficulties that beset us all equally.  May I commend you on your lead article in the last issue. The brief  and poignant story of that woman for  whom 'nothing was working' was one  of the strongest statements I have  read illustrating the essence of our  aims.  -Joan Ramsay  AUDIOVISUAL       LIBRARY  This month we are completing our list  of the tapes available in the V.S.W.

Had a chat with your friendly woman  bank manager recently? • A problem  straightened out by a helpful woman  senior accountant? And are those  male tellers handling your deposits  expeditiously?  Well, back to reality with a thud.  Focus, this month, would direct  your attention to the Royal Commission Report's recommendation No. 62:  That Chartered Banks (a) make it  known that they intend to give women  equality of opportunity; (b) eliminate the practice, where it exists,  of requiring a longer attachment  period for women than for men before  promotion to management; (c) ensure  that they have a record of women  qualified for promotion to be considered as vacancies occur; (d) provide more opportunities for women  to participate in both in-service  and outside training programmes....  and (e) encourage their women employees to improve their knowledge  and capabilities through management training courses and educational  courses, such as those of the  Institute of Canadian Bankers, in  reasonable expectation that successful completion of these courses  will lead to opportunities for promotion.  In other words, what about some  bank balancing in training and  promotion opportunities?  In our  opinion and, we are sure, in yours,  employment practices in banks are  badly in need of improvement at a  faster rate than they are getting it.  As the ACSW point out in "What's  Been Done?" last year, out of 6500  bank managers in Canada, 80 were  women. That's 1.2 percent. The  Federal Government can do something about this because employment in chartered banks fall within  its jurisdiction.  Through legislation it can require banks to end  discrimination on the basis of sex  or marital status.  Write to the Government - particularly the Minister of Labour - and  to your M.P.

Gifford-Jones, M.D.  McClelland & Stewart $7.95  The God-complex of the Medical  Profession ensured for too long  that we knew nothing, couldn't  find out, and thereby fulfilled  our doctor's expectations that  we knew nothing.  But a book designed to make us better players  in a game of blind man's bluff  rests on the fallacious presumptions that patients will continue  to play the game rather than  demanding the facts, explanations,  and assistance which are necessary to exercise what must untim-  ately remain our own judgment of  what is best for us. Nothing,  for instance, can be more vital  to the patient's well-being than  understanding every word the doctor says.  But we must not inter-  up t when we don't understand,  must not take too much of the  doctor's precious time, and can't  insist that the doctor explain.  Pure trickery is the remedy he  suggests for the doctor who won't  reveal the results of a biopsy,  and it would appear that we are to  just give up if the doctor refuses  us a look at a pathology report.  That we should explain in clear  and unambiguous terms that we have  a right to that information and  expect to get it is simply no part  of this doctor's perception.  Perhaps I am being too harsh on a  doctor who is clearly a concerned  member of his profession and of  our community.  His twentieth century Hippocratic Oath and patient's  Bill of Rights have much to recommend them, as does his analysis of  the fear syndrome which can do the  patient so much more harm than the  disease.  But our biggest fear can t  only be our own ^ignorance, and  Gifford-Jones could have done much,  much more to eliminate that ignorance had he spent less print on  telling us why the doctors have the  problems they have.  - Lee Masters. Women from Canada's Ethnic Groups -  Seminar August 4 - 8, 1975  It could happen to you! A phone call  one morning from Ottawa asking you to  participate in a seminar! The subject for me was the processes of self-  identity as an individual with a separate cultural experience within  Canadian society. The setting was to  be Stanley House near New Richmond on  the Gaspe Peninsula in the second  week of August. Thirteen women from  across Canada had been invited by  Wanda Joy Hoe of the Canadian Commission for UNESCO.  We met at 7 p.m. at the CN station  at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel and,  after a gigantic dinner, embarked on  the overnight train that brought us  to our destination the following afternoon! This gave us ample opportunity to get to know one another  before the seminar which contributed  greatly to the success'1 of this meeting.  The first session showed what a motley group we were. There was a  wealth of experience to draw from!  Since I had lived in many parts of  Europe and Africa after leaving India,  and in various provinces of Canada, I  felt very much at home in this group.  One of the participants was a Native  Indian woman who made it very clear  at the outset that she was not an  ethnic person but a native of this  country.  The objective of the meeting was to  share among ourselves the processes  of self-identity as women from particular cultural orientations, with a  view to determine common steps in  these processes and possibly pose  some ways and means to help others  who are facing similar conflicts and  have need of help.  Since most of us  were single women, very interesting  experiences emerged. We felt that  our present identity was formed from  the experiences that we encountered  ALONE. Women who came with families  or who already had relatives or friends here had a very different picture of Canada. Our background  prior to entering this country —  our town, country, family upbringing  — played a significant role in the  degree of adaptation we achieved.  I  was intensely interested in this session, but I must mention that a few  women were not into 'delving in the  past' but were interested in the present.  So we moved into this arena.  MOSAIC  Canada is, for the most part, an immigrant society, with cultural differences as a part of life. Only  recently, however, has the concept  of cultural diversity become an acceptable fact, and the maintenance  and development of one's own cultural heritage seen as a positive phenomenon. The recent slew  of folk  festivals across the country bears  testimony to this facto  And yet — this concept of a cultural  mosaic has been accepted only among a  limited number of people. When I attended several ethnic happenings in  Vancouver I was struck by the sparse  attendance of people from other ethnic groups. The reluctance in accepting this phenomenon has created many  problems among immigrant groups, but  more particularly has considerably  affected the second and subsequent  generations of people of ethnic  origins (other than the mainstream  ones).  For various reasons, some  people will entirely reject their  ethnicity and appear to assimilate  totally into the mainstream society.  Some others will retain their cultural traditions and strongly maintain  the cultural precepts and lifestyles  of their ethnic group. The majority  fall between these two. A few years  ago, at a national multi-cultural  conference in Montreal, I was thrilled to hear government representatives  assuring us that Canada did not want  a 'melting-pot' but a 'mosaic'.  There are many existing programs for  ethnic groups in Canada, including  immigrant orientation, folk-cultural  events, and writings of histories of  some groups.  The immigrant orientation programs provide help for the  newly-arrived; the folk-cultural  events encourage retention of particular traditions; and the historical  works will hopefully, in time, impart  to the younger generations a sense of  the contribution of the ethno-cultur-  al groups to the Canadian heritage.  As a high school teacher in Montreal  for several years I was appalled at  the ignorance of most of the students  regarding their ethnic culture and  especially of their parents' language.  Since this segment of the ethnic population has grown up in Canada they  can easily identify with the majority  culture in which they exist.  However, they lack sufficient reinforcement to support their sense of worth  from the viewpoint of their ethnic  heritage. As a result, these people  face an identity problem which can  often be in conflict one with the  other, an identity which is based upon a two-fold cultural experience within the Canadian society. How often  have we come across children, teenagers, who are ashamed of their parents  — those pioneers who made this country  a wonderful place to be in!  Females from the diverse ethnic cultures have a further conflict to face  and it then becomes a question of overcoming triple binds: (1) the biological  fact of being female in the sociological fact of a male-dominated society;  (2) coming from an ethnic group which  has long-established roles and expectations which most often limit the  horizons for self-actualization; (3)  facing mainstream societal precepts  of a female from a certain culture  and mainstream peer group pressures  to conform to an expected norm.  The seminar revolved around the questions arising from the above: How have  we, as women from differing cultural  backgrounds, dealt with these pressures and/or conflicts? Are they ever  satisfactorily resolved? Can there  be mutually reinforceable processes  to share across the various ethnic  groups? On the third day the participants drew up their own agenda: e.g.  Stereo-typing within ethnic groups,  separateness from one's ethnic group,  the role of the elderly.  Before I went to this meeting I had  been in the process of organising a  conference for multi-cultural women  through the group I have been working  with since last year.  I came back  from the seminar more than ever convinced of the need for such a conference in B.C. — mainly on the  basis of culture-exchange among ethnic  groups themselves (we are so ignorant  of other cultures) and between them  and the mainstream of Canadian society.  We are planning this for the first  week of November and will keep you  informed.  — Mary Barretto  LLP.  A $150 million Initiatives Program  will spearhead the Federal Program  against unemployment this fall. Approximately $18 million has been allocated  to L.I.P. projects operating throughout British Columbia.  An important feature of L.I.P. this  year is that private companies can  sponsor projects. The Honorable Robert  Andras, Minister of Manpower and Immigration, stated that the initiative  and expertise of the business community can well be put to use in community betterment schemes. Businesses  will be required to follow the basic  L.I.P. criteria which remain largely  unaltered from previous years.  As in the past years of the Local  Initiatives Program, Canadian citizens  will be asked to use their creativity  and initiative to help reduce seasonal  unemployment in their own communities.  By suggesting ideas for projects to  the government of Canada. Canadians  can create worthwhile jobs for the  unemployed which will also be of benefit to their community.  This year projects may start as early  as November 3rd and no later than January 26,1976. All projects must terminate by June 26, 1976. Hiring must  be handled through Canada Manpower  Centres.  Applications and the Guide to Applir-  '  cants are now available at all Canada  Manpower Centres. The deadline for submission is September 12, 1975, however  early submission is strongly advised.  For further information contact-a L.I.P.  project officer (682-8731) or the local  Manpower Centre. Have you ever arrived home exhausted  after work, felt irritable, depressed  and tired although nothing in particular had happened that would cause  these feelings?  You might lay the blame on the moon-  phase or 'those days'. But there is  another possibility — and probably  the real cause: your physical environment at work.  The design of most new office buildings is frightening! Who doesn't  recognize the layouts where the bosses,  frequently absent at meetings,' on  trips, etc., occupy offices with a  view and natural light. These amenities are valued as a sign of 'prestige.'  On the other hand, the secretaries  and typists are huddled together in  the middle of the building.  Assuming you are an office worker who  spends eight hours a day at the office,  you spend one-half of your waking  hours in an environment where there  is no day or night, no summer or winter. The light level is mercilessly  the same all day — some of the fluorescent tubes flicker nervously. The  office -  sickness  climate is controlled — the 'optimum'  temperature, the 'optimum' humidity.  The airconditioning system emits a  constant "sshh" — this is 'optimum'  too — the ideal noise to muffle all  other noises.  The surroundings are relieved only  by a travel poster depicting some  exotic scene or a plant that somehow  manages to surrive under adverse conditions.  Coffeebreaks? — regulated at 10:15  and 3:15.— have a break whether you  want one or not. The colours of your  environment? — probably grey or beige  — perhaps a pink or dull yellow.  If you are one of a number of typists  you probably sit in rows — the most  efficient arrangement.  In short, what is being done is the  removal cf most outside stimuli —  17  input on which your physical and  mental well-being depend very strongly. In an experiment a man was placed  in a watertight capsule and isolated  from all outside stimuli. It took 20  minutes for the man to become dangerously disorientated. If the experiment  had continued, it would probably have  resulted in death. His physical system  would have collapsed.  Admittedly this is a strong example,  but doctors report that a great many  women come to them with complaints  that don't seem to have immediate  physical causes — exhaustion, migraines — all of which could be  rooted in a negative environment.  It would seem that too much of our  energy is being drained by our physical  environment— energy that could otherwise be spent on creative and enjoyable  activities. It is time that people  who work in inadequate surroundings  put pressure on unions, bosses and  architects — in order that they  might regain their health and give  just what they are paid for — work.  -Viviane Hotz  Service, Office and Retail Workers  Union of Canada;(SORWUC), is the first  union of its kind in the country. Primarily, it is a union for working women because the majority of those employed in clerical, sales and service  jobs are female. However, some 10 per  cent of SORWUC's members are male.  Women employed in these occupations  constitute the lowest paid sector of  the labour force, and a union is one  answer to the gap between male and  female incomes, which is increasing  despite equal pay laws.  Approximately one-quarter of working  B.C. women are already unionized. Why  do they need another union? "Because  the rights of working women are usually  low priority for male-dominated unions,"  says Elizabeth Godley, SORWUC member.  "To them,women are ultimately replaceable as workers, and so women's rights  are generally bargained away or just  plain ignored."  "Most union negotiators are bureau?-  crats who haven't worked on the shop  floor for years. They are out of touch  with workers' needs. They are also paid  more than the labourers so they don't  want to stick their necks out during  the bargaining," says Ms. Godley.  SORWUC solves bureaucratic entrenchment and isolation by electing its  executive and paid staff annually. No  one can hold a position for more than  one year.  Many large unions will not organize  small businesses, where most women  work, considering It uneconomical.  But SORWUC is working to organize the  unorganized, not to make money. Members  run the union free. It's just as expensive for them to draw up a contract  for 25 women as for one woman and they  have done so — for a secretary who is  a one-woman bargaining unit!  Rank and file control of each local  is emphasized in SORWUC because,"it's  more democratic," says Elizabeth Godley. All members have the independence  to negotiate settlements on their own  behalf.  They have solid backing from the Association of University and College Employees and from other individual trade  unionists. SORWUC is a unique opport-  s.o. r.w.u.c.  unity for women to gain control over  their working lives.  "Actually, we may have an advantage,"  says Ms. Godley. "It is disconcerting  for male negotiators to be faced with  a solid team of female bargainers. We  break the rules by refusing to make  predictable compromises. We mean what  we say and it puts them off guard."  SORWUC believes it is a .myth that you  can't organize women, but it may be  harder. Women are largely ignorant of  how unions work and are suspicious of  unions dominated by men. Their hard-  won successes over the past three  years prove it can be done. SORWUC  settlements include Vancouver Transition House, full-time workers on the  Vancouver Opportunities Program, a  small legal firm and some community  groups. Women employed by these organizations now enjoy better wages, longer  vacations, control over Shift work and  maternity benefits.  SORWUC is currently bargaining a contract en behalf of the Southill Day  Care Centre workers in Vancouver. "It  is especially hard to secure good pay  for a job that is traditionally undervalued as 'women's work'," says Ms.  Godley. "But if we can do it, we will  have set an important precedent."  SORWUC may be influencing the other  larger unions subtly. Some are taking  steps to improve the status of women  by studying local contracts for sex  discrimination. As a union for secretaries, waitresses, salesclerks,  SORWUC won't be stealing any members  away from larger logging, fishing and  mining unions, but women employed in  those industries will soon be asking  why their union isn't doing for them  what SORWUC is doing for its members.  -Prepared for WCWN by Karen  Richardson  For more information oh SORWUC contact:  SORWUC, 2049 Turner St. Vancouver, B.C.  or call 253-5059 evenings.

Once the information is  compiled, it will be organized and  made available to the general public  first through a series of travelling  exhibits, which will tour public libraries, community centres, and high  schools throughout the province" A  booklet will be put together after  the exhibits have been completed. By  distributing the booklet to high  school counselling offices, the project people hope to encourage more  female students to choose architecture  as a career.  If funding permits the project will  also establish an Archives, which will  serve as an on-going resource and information centre for the documentation  and promotion of the role of women in  architecture.  Research for the project will be done  primarily through the mails. The  group is sending questionaires to all  B.C. women who have been or are presently interested in architecture.  The forms will determine what types  of projects women in architecture are  involved with, whether it be building  design, historical research, local  area planning, etc.  W.I.A. is supported by the Architectural Institute of B.C., the UBC School  of Architecture, and The Community  Planning Association of B.C.

Human Rights Commission  Career directions and decisions are  generally shaped at the high school  level. Are today's guidance counsel- "  lors advising teen-aged women on changing realities and new possibilities?  What is happening in all those guidance classes and consultations?  "It's what is not happening that is  important," stresses Reva Dexter,  BoC. Department of Education's special advisor on sex discrimination.  Ms. Dexter says that the problem isn't  that sexism is blatant anymore but,  rather, that guidance counsellors  simply are not open to all the opportunities for women.  An example — young women who are not  going on to University are not getting  enough knowledgeable and supportive  counselling on alternative vocational  training by the often middle class  and higher education-oriented counsellors.  Ms. Dexter is also concerned about the  quality of personal counselling young  women get, the lack of discussion of  alternate lifestyles, the 'band-aid'  approach to problems of identity and  interpersonal relationships.  Sir Charles Tupper Secondary in Vancouver's east end, a racially mixed  school where the major sources of family income are industry, small businesses, service and clerical areas, has  a pool of seven guidance counsellors -  three women and four men.  Pat Friesen, counsellor for Grade 10  marks in the higher grades, Pat Friesen  cites working against parental expectations as the main problems a woman student has in her career decision.  Prince of Wales Secondary is one of the  highest income per capita schools in  dents with their self-and social aware- Vancouver with most families having a  ness. She feels responsible for expos- professional or private company owner  ing them to different career and soc  -guidance-  and 11 female students at Sir Charles  Tupper, sees her role as helping stu  ial arenas.they might not have been  aware of or comfortable with before.  So they have toured the stables at the  Police Academy, had afternoon tea at  a downtown hotel, visited Douglas  College, been camping, tried water-  skiing .  Explaining that the majority of her  time is spent in personal counselling  rather than in career/vocation planning, Pat Friesen says that most of  the graduating female students go on  to minimum-education, low-paying jobs  because of financial realities. Miss  Friesen says that a university education is not a priority issue with parents and students or even, sometimes,  an option for either male or female  students"  Pat Friesen admits that if there is  a decision for further education, the  female students still are mainly interested in the traditional "women's  careers" — secretarial, elementary  teaching, practical nursing.  She sees  more and more exposure to alternatives  as the answer.  Along with the slipping math and science  ship background. Donna Pearson and  Diane Heath, female students counsellors  at the school, say that active parent  involvement in the school is an important feature of Prince of Wales.  Most of the women students at Prince of  Wales are going onto higher education,  usually university, in keeping with  parental expectations. The majority  have definite goals — perhaps social  work, education or nursing — but rehabilitative medicine, law and architecture,  also. There is a lot of encouragement  and support from parents when their  daughters make professional choices.  Diane Heath who has been teaching for a  number of years has noticed a real difference in questions asked by the female  students, reflecting an interest away  from "women's careers".  Ms.: Pearson  finds that more and more students are  choosing careers based on what they like  — such as the outdoors, working with wood,  photography, handicrafts.  Both of the women say that most of their  personal counselling goes to the Grade 9  and 10 students while Grades 11 and 12  want career planning help.  — Debra Little, WCWN subscribe!

KINESIS:  During the I.W.Yo Conference in  Mexico, I remember being struck  by the irony of wealthy articulate women inside the conference  halls arguing about feminist  issues, while outside the halls  walked poor Mexican women whose  major complaints were illiteracy  and poverty! Well, here in the  Maritimes I was again struck with  similar feelings.  I am currently  in the 4th month of a 6 months  cross-Canada trip and it's been  an interesting experience to see  first-hand the attitudes, values  and life-styles of other women  across the country. While every  major city has a smattering of  feminist organizations, when I  left the cities for the countryside, I encountered other  "illiterates" - in the Women's  Movement. The women I inet —  especially in rural Quebec,  where I lived with a farm family  for some time to practise my  French— were so different, so  stereotyped, so backward in  their views of "woman's place"  and their own sense of self-  importance, that eventually I  stopped being amazed at their  attitudes and started questioning my own! During my years  with the Media Group, we often  held long discussions on what we  considered to be topics of vital  importance to feminists - and  these topics still are of importance to me. But after months of  travelling and meeting women of  all ages and social status, I am  wondering why these rural women  are still back in the mid '50's  as far as the women's movement is  concerned.  I am enclosing this  full-page article from the  "Moncton Times" as an example of  this.
