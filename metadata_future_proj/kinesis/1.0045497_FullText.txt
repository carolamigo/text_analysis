Vancouver Status of Women 2029 W. 4th Ave.  February 1976  VOLUME V       NO    52  ISSN 0317-9095  good-bye   iwy  If we weren't already aware that International Women's Year is over, the provincial government made it perfectly clear  during the first two weeks of 1976.  By the 12th of January, the Office of the Provincial Co-ordinator of the Status of Women had been abolished and with it  the appointment of Gene Errington as Co-ordinator. Also abolished was the position of Special Advisor to the Department  of Education on Sex Discrimination in B.C. Schools held by Julia Goulden. At the same time the voluntary Advisory  Committee on Sex Discrimination in Public Schools was disbanded.  Somehow the entire point of IWY has been missed. It was not supposed to just be a calendar mascot — one year the  Year of the Rabbit, the next the Year of the Woman, the. next the Year of the Dragon....  IWY was intended to be a beginning. It was a time to define and focus on the problems and needs of women that have  kept us from realizing our full potential, a time to begin ongoing programs that would improve the status of women.  This was not a one-year project — it involves far-reaching changes in the legal, social, economic and psychological  framework of our lives.  The United Nations World Plan of Action for IWY ealled for "intensified action to promote equal rights, opportunities  and responsibilities of both sexes, to ensure the full integration of women in the total development effort, and to  involve women widely in international co-operation, and hence in the strengthening of world peace."  Marc Lalonde, federal Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, said," ... I am vitally concerned that International  Women's Year not become an end in itself, but rather, that it be seen in the context of the government's overall  program to improve the status of women, and to create awareness of the principles of equality in all Canadians. 1975  can provide a country-wide focus for that aim, but full equality in our country will not be achieved in one year.  The on-going work towards effecting change must be continued."  cond't continued  from frontpage....  Former Provincial Secretary Ernie Hall stated less than one year ago, at the establishment of the Office of the Provincial Co-ordinator of the Status of Women,"We recognize that women face some serious and specific problems, and  therefore we are making a commitment to take positive action to overcome the various forms of discrimination arising  from the past. We view International Women's Year as an opportunity to begin to focus on this important area of governmental responsibility. We do not see International Women's Year as an isolated acknowledgment of women's problems and  past contributions....We expect to make substantial progress in various areas during International Women's Year. But  more importnat is the fact that we will continue this progress in the years ahead until we have achieved a state of  affairs of which all British Columbians can be proud."  Present Provincial Secretary Grace McCarthy said January 11,1976 in reference to the termination of the Office of  the Provincial Co-ordinator of the Status of Women,"It was a Women's Year organization, a Women's Year tribute, and  an International Women's Year grant in total for 1975. As far as the projects are concerned, most of them were  attached to the one year."  To get vital legislation drafted and passed; to achieve full equality before the law; to provide adequate child care  to ease the burden of working mothers; to open up jobs and economic opportunities to women; to erase the sex stereotyping in textbooks, curriculum and counselling in our schools, is not a one-year project.  We have been told that if women are truly concerned it is their responsibility to continue the work towards these  goals. And so it is. But it is also the responsibility of our elected governments which are supposed to represent  us — half the population of this country. International Women's Year has come and gone. Not a great deal has changed.  It is time for our governments to do more NOT less.  - Jo Lazenby  The Provincial Status of \   men Coordinator's Office has been closed by  the Socred government, because "IWY  is over."  "We were just beginning to make some  headway," says Gene Errington, Coordinator of the Office which fell  under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Secretary. "It is tragic for  this office to be closed now."  "The previous government made a  commitment to a permanent Women's  8ffice to continue programs necessary  to improve the status of women in  British Columbia. IWY was only a  beginning. This is the work of a  lifetime." she notes.  The establishment of Errington's  Office in January 1975 was greeted  with little fanfare, treated almost  as a matter of course. Until now it  has received little public attention.  What was its purpose and what did it  accomplish?  Errington's mandate went far beyond  IWY — to advising, coordinating and  monitoring government programs for  women to ensure them equal opportunity. In only a year, with a small  staff and limited budget, she laid  solid groundwork from which to integrate women into the political and  economic structure of the province  for the first time.  Errington focused on areas of major  and immediate concern to women both  in the home — eg. marital property  laws — and in the labour force —  eg. affirmative action plans.  B.C. is one of the few provinces  without an equal employment program  for women in the public service,  the largest employer of females in  the province. Errington lobbied for  establishment of affirmative action  CLOSED  plans for the civil service. The  structures were set up for this and  ready to be put into operation. The  Socred government has given no indication what it intends to do with  ito  The Provincial Status of Women Coordinator also helped draft legislation for community of property in  marriage. The proposal is not complete. Ontario has already implemented similar laws and again Socreds ..  have not declared their position on  this matter.  Through her Office Errington awarded  $100,000 in grants to IWY projects.  She also secured an additional $50,000  emergency funding to keep a number  of women's centres alive. Her proposal  for the long-term core funding of  women's centres was close to acceptance before the election.  Until the creation of her bffice,  there were no specific monies set  aside by<:the provincial government  for women's projects. As they did not  then, and do not now, come under the  specific jurisdiction of any one  department, status of women grant  applications are given low priority  despite the pressing need for their  vital services. TT  Hence many projects  and centres existed and will continue  to exist on volunteer labour and shoe  string budgets.  Provincial Secretary Grace McCarthy,  under whose jurisdiction Errington's  office was closed, says women's groups  can still apply to provincial government for grants, but she has not  specified which department, how much  money will be allotted, and what the  eligibility requirements are. In the  absence of Errington's office it seem:  likely the funding situation will  return to its pre-IWY situation for  women.  Errington also did extensive liason  with many provincial and federal  departments, branches, agencies,  committees, programs and councils  across Canada, improving communications, understanding and awareness of  status of women issues.  McCarthy says it is up to community  women's groups to continue their  efforts alone to improve the status  of women, now that IWY is over.  Without staff, money, power or government representation, onw asks  how they can be expected to do this?  - Karen Richardson, WCWN  women MLAs  Rosemary Brown, NDP, Vancouver-Burrard  Eileen Dailly, NDP, Burnaby North  Pat Jordan, SOC, Okanagan North  Grace McCarthy, SOC, Vancouver-Little  Mountain  Karen Sanford, NDP, Comox  Barbara Wallace, NDP, Cowichan-Malahat  W.I.N, toget axe?

Because if you were like most of us  around here you fought your way  through the Election Furor, tried to  pick yourself and your friends off  the floor after it was over, only to  find Christmas was upon you. You made  it through the Jolly Season. And  then the Real Crunch canie! Our'fears  about a party with no policy on women's issues began to come true.  Christmas, no matter what it was like,  has got to be the highpoint of those  four weeks!  On January 8th, Gene Errington was  notified that the Provincial Status  of Women Co-ordinator's Office was  being closed — effective December  31.1975. The reason given by the  Provincial Secretary was that IWY was  over. The previous government had  made a commitment to establish a  permanent office and Gene's own contract had been extended until March  31.1976. Two of her staff had contracts until April 7, and June 15.  When the new government was formed,  the Provincial Status of Women Coordinator's Office sent a report to  the new Provincial Secretary outlining ^the Office's terms of reference and detailing the work done by  the Office and the programs it hoped  to continue work on, and requested  a meeting to discuss the work of the  Office and its future. Gene mentioned  at a VSW General Meeting, January  20th, that she and her staff did not  expect an early meeting. They knew  they would be on the bottom of the  list and would have to wait. But they  hoped that when they did meet with  the Provincial Secretary that at  least some of the programs would be  continued — even if not by them.  They did not expect the entire Office  to be wiped out and certainly not by  means of a simple one-paragraph  letter informing them that (retroactively) they no longer existed.  At this time they have had no other  contact with the Provincial Secretary.  The Provincial Status of Women's  Co-ordinator's Office had the status  of a Branch, and no other office  with this status was denied a meeting.  In talking about her term as Coordinator, Gene expressed her appreciation for the support and encourage-  mentshe had received from VSW. She  described how difficult-it was to be  placed in the position of buffer  zone between women's groups with all  their hopes and needs and the government who in turn hoped that "if they  ignored us long enough we might go  away." Gene said the feeling of many  politicans is that there aren't any/,  votes in women's issues.— In fact  to come out in support of women's  issues might lose them votes. We  must make it clear to MLAs that we  represent a great many votes!  On January 8 we received word at the  VSW Office that the Office of the  Provincial Status of Women Co-ordinator had been closed. We immediately sent a telegram of protest to the  Provincial Secretary and the Premier  and notified CJOR, CKNW, CKWX and  CBC, all of whom carried news coverage of the closure for the rest of  the evening and into the next day.  We also phoned as many women's groups  and organizations in the province as  we could reach to inform them of the  situation and urge them to send telegrams and letters of protest to the  Provincial Secretary, Premier Bennett,  their MLAs and local newspapers. From  then on the pace was frantic! Newspapers called for statements, radio  called for statements, TV stations  turned up with cameras! President  Nancy Conrod and BCTW Co-ordinator  Diana Bissell were filmed in the  basement of our dffice for CBC Hourglass and BCTV Newshour, and then  the cameras moved upstairs where  other staff members were trying to  give statements over the phones, contact other women's groups, answer  questions, send off press releases  and letters and manage to hold onto a shred of sanity. By the time  Friday was over, we had managed to  contact more than 100 women's groups  and organizations throughout the  province and many of them had promised to contact other groups in their  own areas.  hello  1976  By Monday we were receiving copies  of some of the letters and telegrams  and petitions sent by other groups  and clippings from local and out-of-  town newspapers. We kept sticking  these up on the doors until we ran  out of room and they attracted a lot  of attention!'We also contacted CBC's  "As It Happens" and Gene was interviewed on national radio by Barbara  Frunio  Then the other bomb dropped! On January 12th Julia Goulden, Special Advisor to the Department of Education  on Sex Discrimination in B.C. Schools,  recieved a phone call from Nora Grove  BCTF Executive Assistant Status of  Women Program., Why, Nora asked, had  the January 14 regular meeting of  the Provincial Advisory Committee on  Sex Discrimination in Schools, of  which they were both members, been  cancelled. She had received a call  from the secretary of the Department  of Education's representative on the  Committee, John Meredith, who is  also Superintendent of Educational  Programs. Julia had not been aware  of the cancellation and in turn phoned Meredith's office. Yes, she was  informed, the meeting had been cancelled because the committee had been  disbanded and her own position had  been terminated. A letter would follow.  Julia phoned Nadine Allen, VSW staff  member and Chairperson of the Advisory  Committee. Immediately following this  conversation, Nadine received a call  from Meredith's secretary confirming  that the meeting had been cancelled,  and she contacted Meredith himself  who told her that the Committee had  been disbanded because of "a review  of financial and other priorities in  Education." Since that time it has  been impossible for anyone, including the BCTF, to contact Meredith.  The VSW Office swung into action  again — it was like coming out for  the second round, groggy and bleeding  but beginning to see a pattern in  the punches. Phone calls to women's  groups and organizations, telegrams  and letters, press releases, statements, interviews, answering questions, meetings, clinging to sanity, etc.  At the VSW General Meeting, Julia  Goulden shared with us how a representative of the Department of Ed  ucation, Joe Phillipson, explained  her situation to her — she had not  been fired, her position had just  been terminated. A subtle distinction.  Julia had replaced Reva Dexter as  Special Advisor and her duties were  to act as advisor to the Education  Minister and resource person to the  Department of Education in areas of  teaching practice, policy, structure  and philosophy with regard to raising  awareness about sex discrimination  in the public school system. Her term  of appointment still had six months  to run. She had been 'borrowed' from  the Burnaby School District where she  had been a counsellor for nine years.  The Burnaby School District has now  been asked by the Department of Education to find Julia a teaching  position — and of course since she  is under contract to the Department  of Education until the end of June  the Department is prepared to continue to pay her salary whether or not  she works for Burnaby. Julia has  also been told that something may be  found for her within the Department  itself until her contract runs out  — it was suggested that she might  like to write a book or some guides  lines. There is a term for this —  "busy work". Good teachers avoid it.  The Department of Education, it seems,  promotes it.  When the Department's willingness to  pay the Special Advisor's salary until her contract expires (but not to  allow her to carry out her duties)  is taken into account with the fact  that the Advisory Committee would  cost less than $1500 to continue operation until the end of June, it is  difficult to accept the Department's  explanation of "financial" reasons.  The key would seem to be in "the  other priorities in Education." The  Provincial Advisory Committee on Sex  Discrimination in Public Education  consisted of representatives from  B.C. Teachers' Federation, Home and  School Association, school trustees,  Human rights Commission and status  of women groups. Their goal was to  ensure equality of opportunity tor  all students in the educational  system. (See page 4 for Committee's  terms of reference,) This goal then  is not a priority with the Department  of Education. Julia Goulden feels  that not only is the elimination of  sex discrimination in education not  a priority but that "they most definitely do not want to see control  over education decentralized, they  do not want to see the power  structure flattened out."  We have always known that the Women's  Movement was involved in a long hard  struggle, but we have really been  dealt some hard blows in the last  few weeks. Gene Errington hit a nerve  for a great many of us when she said  at the General Meeting that she had  always worked on the principle that  "if you could explain injustices to  people" and "if you could manage to  get women into government positions  then things would start to get  better." We keep doing that. And the  only concrete thing that has happened  is that the Women's Movement keeps  growing. And it is growing! There  are more of us everyday I and we are  more aware and more knowledgeable  and even more committed! But sometimes we feel like Sisyphus — pushing all those years of discrimination  and inequality and powerlessness up  the hill in front of us.  - Jo Lazenby education  Nadine Allen  By disbanding the committee on sex  discrimination and firing special  advisor Julia Goulden, the fossilized  bureaucrats in the Department of Education have clearly demonstrated  that they do not consider sexism to  be an important issue. Clearly John  Meredith, Superintendent of Educational Programmes, who sat on our  committee for 19 months does not see  it as a priority issue.  Concerned people have been urging  the Department for at least five  years to do something about sexist  textbooks, counselling practices,  and other inequities which offer  females second-class opportunities.  The Advisory Committee was struck  in May 1974 as a result of a brief  by the BCTF Status of Women Task  Force to Education Minister Eileen  Dailly. Representatives from the  Human Rights Commission, Home and  School Association, BCTF, School  Trustees, and feminist groups provided the Department with a unique  opportunity to hear from community  people concerned and informed about  sexism in education.  It is simply not true that Goulden  was fired for budgetary reasons and  we take no comfort from assurances  that the committee's work will be  incorporated into the work of the  Department. It is abosolutely intolerable that we continue to allow a  handful of men in the Department to  determine educational policy. Surely  that policy must include the legitimate concerns of people who are  required to send their children to  these schools.  If you have not yet done so, we urge  you to send a letter to Education  Minister McGeer and Premier Bennett  protesting this reactionary decision.  - Nadine Allen  terrace  North-West College in Terrace serves  the five school districts in Northern  B.C. It had a College Council composed  of five school board members — one  from each of the five district school  boards — and five government appointees. The five government appointees  were intended to represent the people  of the area and so they included a  woman, an Indian and a labourer. The  woman had to come from the Queen  Charlotte Islands to attend the meetings. She arrived for a scneduled  meeting recently to find that not  only had the meeting been cancelled  but all the government appointees to  the Council had been cancelled as  well.  New, government appointees will be  selected. One of the criteria is  that they should be successful in  their own businesses.  calendars  THE CANADIAN KIDS CALENDAR 1976  14 pages, 3-colour illustrations  9"xl2" approx., $3.75.

Most of Stanley Park's hordes of  summer fitness fans have long since  packed up their Adidas suits for the  season.  But you can still find  Patti out there nearly every afternoon,  putting in a ninety-minute session  of running and sprints which comprise  the basics of her training for the  1976 Olympics.  The regime has worked well for Patti,  who came home with two medals from the  Pan American games in Mexico City last  fall.  She scored a silver medal for  a photo-finish performance in the  women's 100-meter event and a bronze  for her help on a 4 x 400-meter  relay teamD  It makes for a tough schedule, added  to a full-time class load at UBC, where  she's a fourth-year recreation  major working towards a career in  community development.  Patti admists that some days it's  hard to summon the will power to  train.  "But I'm always glad  afterwards that I did," she  says.  "I couldn't do this if I  didn"t enjoy it. And once you  know how it feels to be in good  physical shape, you want to stay  that way."  Patti, who says she could always beat  the neighbourhood boys in sidewalk  races, began to work seriously at  running when she was ten years old,  and living in Courtenay, B.C.  She  thinks the close, small-town  environment there helped to encourage  her interest in sporto  "We learned  to play soccer, volleyball..0just  everything."  But she soon realized, Patti says,  that it was considered unusual for  a girl to have ambitions of being an  athlete.  "There were always a few  girls whose mothers wouldn't let me  play with them because I wasn't 'ladylike'." And there was the high-school  boyfriend who, Patti recalls,"said he  was absolutely disgusted watching me  run.  It was so unlike his idea of  what a woman should be0"  That prejudice, she says, is one that  most women athletes face0  "It's still  just not socially acceptable for a  woman to take sport seriously."  For Patti, support of her family  helped to combat the discouragement  she encountered alsewhere.  "Both  of my parents worked, so I didn't  have the traditional role models  thereo They were always behind me,  and I was able to realize that if  this is what makes me happy, there's  nothing wrong with it!"  DUNNED  Patti*s brand of graceful self-  confidence appears to be an essential  element for success in women's  athletics. Most good women competitors—the ones who make it—tend  to be, she notes, "very determined  people0 You have to be very sure  that this is what you want to do."  One of Canada's most outspoken women's sport figures is Abigail Hoffman, a vetran runner who has competed internationally for over a decade.  Her unrelenting pressure on the Canadian Olympic Association has helped  to secure financial support for training athletes, with awards based on  Olympic entrance requirements and  available equally to man and women.  Patti Loverock credits her friend  Abby Hoffman with leadership of a  growing movement to change the image  of women in sport.  In speeches,  articles and talk shows, Abby points  out the second-class status given to  women's athletics.  School programmes  steer girls away from serious interest  in sport; newspapers, radio and  television feature the activities of  male athletes; recreation and community  centres offer hockey training for  boys, sewing classes for girls"  It is, says Abby, an old story.  But Patti is hopeful that the situation  is, however slowly, changing,,  "Feminist ideas have begun to filter  down.  I think that will have to  affect the way parents treat their  children and the way women learn to  think of themselveso"  Several B.Co women will compete this  year in the Olympic track and field  events, others in swimming and  team contests. And Patti says she  expects to see more and more women  beginning to view competitive sport  as a realistic—and attractive—  goalo  She looks forward to a good showing  in Montreal next summer, but Patti  says the public, the media and some  coaches have overemphasized the  importance of collecting medals <,  "It's unfortunate,"she says, "but  the Olympics have become too much of  a political arena.  I suppose all  athletes are motivated differently,  but for most of us the sense of  personal achievement is what's important.  If I feel I've done my best,  I'll be satisfied with my performance."  Maclean's Magazine, commenting last  spring on Abby Hoffman's long battle  against sexism in sport, noted that  "winning an Olympic medal is tough  when you have to overcome both the  competition and the burden of being  a woman."

The League of Canadian Poets is a  national organization of professional  poets and, on the regional level, we  are dedicated to promoting BCC.  writers to B.C audiences, by  exposing audiences to the authors  themselves, reading from their own  works. We would like especially  to encourage communities outside of  the lower mainland to participate in  our program and take advantage of the  opportunity to meet some of B"C0's  talented writers0  There will be about 20 poets taking  part in the program during 1976, and  since about half of these are women—  and feminists—I would particularly  be glad to direct them to women's  groups in the province that would be  receptive to their kind of poetry.  Thus, if your group is interested, I  would be pleased to recommend poets  to you or to consider your choices.

PORNO-PROPAGANDA OF RAPE  PORNO  For the past few years, the women's  movement has been too busy with abortion, equal pay, women's studies and  sexist advertising, to pay much attention to less popular issues.  Now that we have those topics under  our belts, I would like to'suggest  that we take a serious look at pornography.  Oh no, not another problem  you groan?  Is there really a feminist viewpoint  on porno?  I mean, after all, we're  supposed to be secually liberated and  opposed to censorship, aren't we?  We reject racist slurs and ethnic  jokes. Then why do we defend the use  of obscenity, four letter words many  of which are directed at women.  Freedom of speech for men.  Porno may be chic today and we may  be accused of the new feminist chastity if we oppose it but think about  thiso Most of the porno market is  geared to menc  Women are turned off by pornography.  Why?  It is not because we are inhibited, let me tell you. We are disgusted by it because it dehumanizes,  abuses and discards us.  I am not advocating equal opportunity  in pornography.  I am saying that pornography is anti-female propoganda.  The most popular phantasy portrayed  in porno is rape, of one sort or  another. Think about that.  - Karen Richardson IMMIGRANT WOMEN  IMMIGRANT WOMEN'S ADVOCACY  COMMITTEE - WHAT'S BEEN DONE  The report Immigrant Women in the  Labour force was completed last  year under the joint sponsorship of  the YWCA and the Vancouver Status of  Women and funded by an L"I0Po grant.  It underscored the problems immigrant  women face in the working world and  made many recommendations to different  federal and provincial government  departments.  Then what happened?  Firstly, some women from the project  and other interested volunteers from  Vancouver City College, the Provincial  Status of Women Co-Ordinator's office  and Multi-lingual Services Society  formed the Immigrant Women's Advocacy  Committee. The main focus of the  committee was to monitor progress  made by government and community  programs are not meeting needs and  to identify new needs as they arise.  The parameters were the immigrant  working woman and her family; the role  was one of watchdog, advocate,  agitant and researcher.  It is an  ongoing assignment.  One of the committee's first and most onerous  tasks was to follow up on the fate of  the separate reports sent to the  provincial Departments of Labour,  Education, Health and Human Resources  and to the Department of Manpower and  the Unemployment Insurance Commission.  We soon found out that any community  group that sets out to monitor  government progress can only do so  by assessing visible concrete  changes.  "What they do" is the only  available yardstick.  Following is a look at what's been  done:-  Department of Labour  lo  the appointment of two full  time inspectors for an 8 - 10  month period to investigate the  labour standards and environmental  conditions in the factories that  employ many immigrant women.  - all major factories were inspected  and changes in environmental  conditions were effected where  necessary. Many of the original  recommendations focused upon  such problems as dust, chemicals,  poor ventilation, smell, noise and  inadequate washroom facilities.  - two bilingual community workers were  offered honorariums to assist the  inspectors in their investigation.  2. the translation of labour regulations and the rights of the employee  into thirteen different languages to  inform workers of such benefits as  minimum wage, fringe benefits,  lunchroom regulations, etc.  These  translations in Punjabi, Hindi,  Chinese, Italian, Portugese,  Spanish, Japanese, Greek, French,  Serba-Croation, Ukranian and Russian  are available through employment  offices, ethnic centres and churches,  in addition to spot announcements on  ethnic radio stations.  3. a submission by the Immigrant  Women's Advocacy Committee to  the legislative committee concerned  with re-drafting the Labour  Standards Legislation.  Our submission  prepared by Nancy Conrod, dealt  with piece work, advocating  guaranteed minimum wages to piece  workers amongst other recommendations.  Department of Human Resources  1.  the translation of day care  information into five different  languages;.  French, Italian, German,  Chinese, Greek. These translations  are available through the Day Care  Information Service, 45 West 8th  Avenue, Vancouver.  873-3767.  Department of Manpower and Immigration  lo  the establishment of a pilot  program to teach English to immigrant  women on the job. This project,  scheduled to begin in January 1976  at the Jantzen factory in Vancouver,  will provide access to language  training that many immigrant women  lack because of family responsibilities  shift work, and the lack of transportation amongst other factors. An important part of the project will be a re  search component funded by Vancouver  City Social Planning Department  designed to evaluate the effectiveness  of the program on worker morale and  performance on the job. Hopefully  with these results Manpower and the  Immigrant Women's Advocacy Committee  can convince other employers to  offer similar programs.  Some substantial changes have been  made but there is a lot left to be  done. Areas of particular concern  still are:-  1. the availability of multilingual  staff in Manpower Centres, schools,  day care centres, social service and  health centres in communities with  a large proportion of immigrant  families.  The implementation of this recommendation does not require more funding;  it requires a commitment on the part  of government to recruit persons who  understand the language and culture  of the community in which they work.  2. increased opportunities for  immigrant women to learn English.  Priorities still seem to be given to  the "man as the breadwinner".  If the  woman also works (and certainly most  families in our survey required two  incomes) her chances of moving out  of "invisible" low paying positions  are minimal without language training.  Moreover, the scarcity of daycare  facilities further prohibits the  woman from making use of those few  language programmes perhaps open to  her.

Take the all-male Canada Labour  Relations Council.  This is a tripartite council made up of nine  people from Labour, nine from  Management and six from Government (Department of Labour).  The council's purpose is t,o achieve  a greater degree of industrial  peace and its ultimate goal is  to "develop a fair and workable  income policy for Canadians".  Can  we dare presume that this includes  Canadian women?  Let's not kid ourselves.  Working  women will never get wage parity  with men unless they are permitted  to sit on groups such as the C.L.R.C.  and of course, the future federal  Human Rights Commission.  This  Commission (to be created when the  Human Rights Bill, C-72j is passed)  will be responsible for determining  the "value" of female work in the  "job ghettos" where there is no  male equivalent.  Can you just picture a group of men undertaking  this complicated task?  Here is the government's exp- .  lanation re the C.L.R.C.  Appointments are made in a rather  roundabout way - the two nominators, Joe Morris (Canadian  Labour Congress) and W. H. Wightman  (Canadian Manufacturers' Association) submit names to the government.  These are then approved by  the Prime Minister and "officially"  appointed by Labour Minister  John Munro, the Council Chairman.  We suspect that the government was  remiss in that it neglected to  point out their policy - that women  must be included in all federal decision making bodies - to the nominators.  (Or perhaps there has been  a change in government policy?)  However, John Munro has advised the  VSW Executive that the Canadian  Labour Congress and the Canadian  Manufacturers' Association are  "sensitive to this question". He  also promised to make them aware  of our concerns.  Our Committee members and the VSW  Executive have already done a lot  of preliminary correspondence in this  letter  lobby  Dorothy Holme  matter.  So here is a short letter  you can write as a vital- back-up to  our letters.  Please get it in the  mail as soon as possible.

I have  made my displeasure known to the  Prime Minister and am now aware  of the process by which nominations  are made by the C.L.C. and the  C.M.A.  Although I feel that the government  was remiss in not advising you of its  policy - to appoint qualified women  to federal decision-making bodies -  I would also appreciate hearing  your explanation for this apparent  oversight.  I understand that your  people are sensitive to this question  and trust that you will rectify the  matter at your earliest opportunity.  I look forward to hearing from you  soon.

The government needs  these ongoing offices to provide  the direction and continuity for  the changes wich MUST take place  for women.

FEMINISM & RELATIONSHIPS  Since this discussion group was  formed 6 months ago we have been  meeting to share experiences  & ideas on how becoming involved  in the feminist movement has affected our relationships with men  and other women.  Some topics  discussed were: "Are Masculine/  feminine characteristics innate or  learned?" "Raising children in a  sexist society". "Concept of  Open Marriage", "Division of household tasks", "Relationships at  work", "How to establish a non-  sexist relationship with men",  "The liberated man - can a feminist  form a satisfying relationship with  a sexist male?" (no.) In the  coming year we hope to pursue the  last topic as well as "Living  arrangements - alternatives to  traditional marriage beyond open  marriage", "The effects of  political and economic inequalities  upon relationships", "Where are  the liberated men?", "How to raise  the consciousness of your non-  feminist friends".  We meet every  second Monday night at 8 pm in  the VSW office.  New participants  and ideas always welcome.  Feb.  dates are the 9th & 23rd.

VSW  membership activities are happening  heavily in February - nice to have  KINESIS back and the posties back  too so we can let you know what's  happening.

JOHANNA DEN HERTOG is  spending the month of Jan. doing  Ombuds research - she is listing  and cataloglr-g our entire libraries  and files so that we can better  disseminate information,,  NON-STRUCTURED C-R  A regular non-structured C-R  group began late in January and  is interested in having more participants and making up lists  of women who are interested in  forming new groups.  They meet  weekly at each other's  homes, Wednesday evenings.  Please call office and talk  to Diana if you are interested.  CONSCIOUSNESS RAISING GROUP LEADERS?  Consciousness-raising group leaders?  Isn't that what a C-R group should  be wary of?  Only if that leader is self-appointed;  having evolved from within the group  because of the nature of group dynamics.  A trained C-R leader can  guide the group along agreed-upon  guidelines, stimulate discussion  and assist in determining the key  political (as in the use of power)  points of any given topic. This  can keep a C-R group from lapsing  into a "bitch session" or "rap  group" where women express their  personal experience of oppression  WITHOUT the vital process of sensing  that oppression in its political  perspective.  I believe making the personal political is a primary tool women can  use effectively to uproot and destroy  sexism, both individually and en  masse. A structured C-R group,  that is, one having agreed upon  guidelines such as accepting each  woman's experience as unquestionably  valid, choosing a specific topic for  one week, running for ten weeks with  a leader and then carrying on without  one etc is the most provident  way of mobilizing women to strike  out against oppression.  In a C-R,  women in a supportive atmosphere of  sisterhood and genuine respect,  come to understand themselves in  relation to their society; a patriarchal society that oppresses  women.  I trained as a C-R group leader  with the Los Angeles National Organization for Women in 1974/75.  After returning to Vancouver in  July/75, I led a C-R group out  of the Women's Office at UBC.  I am  willing to set up a C-R Program with  the Vancouver Status of Women and as  well as leading C-R's myself I can  also train other women as leaders.  A C-R Committee could be formed to  analyze the process of C-R, its  functions and value in the current  women's movement, and work out ways  to alter and adjust consciousness-  raising as the movement changes and  grows.  Sisters - are you interested? Please  write or phone the VSW if you are  interested in my proposal.  Only  10-15 women interested in going  through C-R are needed to get this  structured group started.  In sisterhood - Marlene Smith  Forty-six women representing a wide  variety of women's groups in the  Lower Mainland met at the Rape Reliei  office Sunday, January 18 to plan  action on making the government aware  of the needs of women. It is hoped  that the action will be nation-wide  and active women's centres across  Canada are being contacted. In B.C.  the action will focus on a concerted,  well publicized lobby on March 8th  action  — International Women's Day. An  office'will be set up outside the  Legislature in Victoria and appointments will be made with all MLAs.  Each MLA will be presented with a  brief dealing with women's issues  and special letters and briefs from  women in his own riding outlining tl  specific needs and problems in that  area. The MLAs will be questioned  and press releases issued from the  'office'.  Port Coquitlam Women's Centre is  notifying women's groups throughout  B.C. by means of their inter-centre  newsletter, INTERCOM.  This project will require a lot of  time and work to organize.

Killarney  Gardens was designed and built as  a family complex - it won a  national magazine award for innovative  family housing. In its first year,  1970, Killarney Gardens was a complex  of apartments and townhouses and play  areas - 227 units - approximately  200 of them occupied by families.  Capt. Cook School Annex on Killarney  St. was placed there partly to serve  the needs of the complex.  In 1973 the owners of Killarney  Gardens asked the YMCA to organize  and operate a Day Care Centre on  the premises. The YMCA was already  running a recreation building,  and were providing a great number of  activities for children and now  were given the top floor of the  building for a daycare centre  with a capacitv of 25 children.  Less than half of the listings that  would accept children would accept  single parent families. Most of those  had additional requirements — double  references, a guarantor for the rent,  questions about boyfriend — or boyfriends — cautions about wild parties!  One landlord suggested that the woman  should go before a board of tenants  who would decide if she were 'acceptable'. One of the women conducting  this survey said she came away feeling "cheap and dirty."  The Human Rights Code (Sect. 5)  offers tenants protection from  discrimination because of "race,  sex, marital status, religion,  colour, ancestry, or place of  origin".  But because the  clause does not include 'age5 or  'children' there is no protection  for families who are denied housing  ?\..\  Today there are fewer than 40  families in Killarney Gardens.  In 1973 there were 67 evictions  of families with teenagers. In the  last 18 months units have been  rented only to adults .  It has  been necessary to consolidate  classes at Capt. Cook School  Annex because of the drop in  enrollment. Mr. Lucas, principal  of the school, says there are now  2 empty classrooms and the  kindergarten class is almost  depleted and the teacher will be  transferred next year.  The recreational program is now almost entirely geared to adult participation -- Ladies Keep Fit, Adult  Swimming, Bridge Night, etc.  When the Day Care Centre opened  19 of the 25 children lived in  Killarney Gardens and 6 were from  the surrounding neighbourhood. When  the centre closed only 6 of the  children actually lived in Killarney  Gardens.. farents of the children  who attended the Centre were very  pleased with the Day Care facilities  and most are experiencing a great  deal of difficulty in making other  arrangements for their children.  Killarney Gardens has joined the list  of living accomodations that will  not accept families. Last fall two  women conducted an informal survey  of rental ads in the Vancouver Sun  classified section. They found  that of the premises listed for rent  on Oct. 10th, less than 10% would  accept children as tenants.  On November  14th they again checked the rental ads  in the Vancouver Sun and found that  only 25 of the 215 listings would  accept children. The average  rent among these 25 listings was $418.  because of their children,, The  plight is worst for single parent  families, the majority of which  are headed by women. Their choices  are limited by the fact that they  have children in their care, they  are single parents and so unacceptable to a large percentage of  those few landlords who will  accept children and as women,  their income, and therefore, the  rent they can afford, is much less  than that of most men. Housing costs  as much for women as it does for  men but the average wage for  women in Canada is only 56% of  that for men. According to the  1966 Census in B.C., 88,804 of  the 543,075 heads of households  were women. The figure is  doubtlessly higher today.  Refusal  to rent living accomodation to such  a large segment of the population  amounts to blatant discrimination.  Although it is more difficult.to  unjustly evict a tenant since  legislation such as that establishing the Rentalsman office was  introduced, harrassment can often  pressure a family into moving.  The living unit is then rented to  "Adults Only". The harrassment  can take many forms - unreasonable  rules - "Do not run on the paths",  "Children are not allowed to visit  other buildings", disciplining  (often physical) of children by  building managers without contacting  or conferring with the parents,  continual checking up on tenants,  which sometimes includes questioning  of neighbours by the management.  Recently, the management of  Killarney Gardens went so far as  to send a letter to members of a  group of tenants who were exchanging  babysitting duties, containing the  following edict "Permission  would not, and has not ever, been  granted for the purpose of babysitting, whether for profit or not."  This edict was judged unenforceable  by the Provincial Office of the  Rentalsman but during the time  before the judgement a great deal  of pressure, anxiety and confusion  was created.  had one caretaker and one assistant  to maintain the premises. A  Tenant's Committee was formed to  protect the tenants and to try  to get recreational facilities  and halt the deterioration of  living conditions in the complex.  Marilyn was a key member of this  committee. Her two sons, aged  9 and 12, were disciplined several  times by the caretaker without  THE  HOUSING  GAME  we   lose  Tenants do have rights, but most  parents, especially single parent  women, are usually in such desperate  need of housing that they are unaware  of their rights or too frightened  or tired to assert them. In many  cases harassment is a subtle art  which leaves tenants with an anxious,  insecure feeling which is conveyed  to their children who come to distrust and dislike their home and  neighbours. Maureen Noir, a parent  living in Killarney Gardens, stated  that when you are a tenant you always  have the feeling that "you are cheating your children."  Maureen Noir and another parent from  Killarney Gardens, Gail Jadot, are  two tenants who decided to try to  alter this situation. They contacted  Margaret DeWees, Secretary-Treasurer  of B.C. Tenants Organization, in  October 1975, to see if they could  find a way to alleviate some of the  problems at Killarney Gardens. A  meeting of all tenants was suggested  and although it was not too successful — the 'adults only' and the  'family' tenants found agreement  difficult — it resulted in the  Killarney Gardens Tenants Association being formed to try and work on  internal problems.  When Margaret DeWees was contactea  by the women from Killarney Gardens  she was already involved with  another woman who was suffering  harassment.  Marilyn Seamen, a single parent  living in Westhill Place in  Port Moody, had already had 2  rent termination notices set aside  by the Rentalsman and her third  hearing in 10 months was coming up  on October 22nd.  In January 1975 Marilyn and three  other single parent women were  served with eviction notices.  Marilyn had lived in the complex for  more than three years, knew the  difficulties in finding a new  place and decided to stand firm.  Westhill Place has 150 units,  divided between 3 buildings.  It  has had 7 different caretakers  in the past four years and, at  the time of Marilyn's last hearing,  Marilyn's knowledge and although  the caretaker said he had numerous  complaints about the boys'  rowdiness no neighbour ever  approached Marilyn with such a  complaint. Marilyn said "You  move in here and vou lose custody  of your kids."  Marilyn's third eviction notice was  set aside by the Rentalsman in late  October. She is still living in West-  hill Place. She is uncomfortable,  her children hate the place. The oldest boy stays away from home as much  as possible.  The all too familiar stories  related to Margaret DeWees by  Marilyn Seamen, Gail Jadot and  Maureen Noir prompted her to  call a meeting on October 16th  that would bring the three women  together with supportive people from  other organizations.  The Tenants Rights for Children (TRC)  grew out of this meeting. On  October 18th, the newly formed group  attended a Child Care Federation  meeting to ask for support for  Marilyn in her upcoming hearing and  to make the focus and aims of TRC  known.  The TRC is a small, dedicated,  energetic group of women whose  conviction that decent housing is a  basic social right and parents and  children should be able to enjoy  it free of harassment and fear, has  caught the attention of both the  media and public officials.  Both  the Vancouver Sun and the  Vancouver Province have written  articles on the group and  members have been interviewed  on local radio and TV stations.  Alderman Michael Harcourt invited the  group to present a brief to Vancouver  City Council Housing Committee —  composed of Alderpersons Harcourt,  Rankin, Bird, Boyce and Cowie.  The TRC proposals put forward at  this meeting were unanimously  endorsed and will be taken to  City Council. The City Charter  doesn't allow for the by-law  that TRC was asking for - one  that would require any new building to provide for families and  buildings converted to 'adults  only' to revert to accepting  families in proportions that would  be determined by a statistical look  TRC is now working on this aspect ot  their proposals through the Provincial  Government which regulates the  Municipalities Act. They will  also be approaching the Dept.  of Labour for changes in the  Human Rights Code and the Attorney-  General for more protection in the  Landlord and Tenant Act.  This  pronged approach is designed to  bring about protection in looking  for, living in and construction  of rental living accomodations.  TRC intends to present its briefs  to the Government during the Spring  session of the legislature.  Meanwhile, the battle goes on, day  by day.  The unenlightened attitude  of an official representative of  the owners of    Killarney Gardens -  "You are just a tenant.  If you  don't like it move" (in conversation with Maureen Noir) and tenants  use rental units as a stop gap  until they can afford to buy" (in  a brief to the Housing Committee)  is shared by a great many  landlords.  The North American  dream of everyone owning their own  home is just that - a dream.  Considering the prices of houses,  the mortgage and interest rates,  and the crowding in urban areas  it is safe to assume that a great  many people will have to accept  rented accomodations as their  permanent form of housing.  They  are entitled to feel secure and  comfortable in their homes.  But  somewhere along the way, we seem  to have lost sight of the fact that  housing is for people.  It is a  situation where a relatively  small segment of the population  controls the living accomodations  desperately needed by a very large  segment of the population. To allow  discrimination and harassment in an  already desperate situation makes it  a cruel game.  Tenants Rights for Children are  optimistic.  It is difficult to  ignore the social 'Tightness' of  their cause and they have attracted  a lot of sympathetic attention.  Aid. Mike Harcourt and Harry Rankin  of Vancouver City Council are  supportive, and Stephen Rogers, new  MLA for Vancouver South, has been  helpful. The Vancouver South  Resources Board has allotted a  sum of money to cover postage,  expenses, etc. With this help  TRC is hoping to be able to set up  a small office.

The clock struck  midnight and the splendour of the  ball disappeared:  she limped home,  through the night, her life enriched  by one glass shoe and some pleasant  memories. Women in Canada may recall  this story as International Women's  Year draws to a close, and legislation  specifically directed at changing  the status of women is reviewed.  At the federal level, several  amendments to existing statutes were  made. Most of these were 'house-  cleaning' in nature, many contained  in Bill C-16, the Omnibus Bill.  These changes included:  -Voter registration rules are now  the same for men and women.  -Immigrant families may enter the  country on the wife's merits.  -Pregnant women now receive  unemployment insurance benefits in  a flexible 15 week leave period  surrounding childbirth.  -Federal government female employees  are protected from dismissal due to  pregnancy.  -Pensions will be paid to widowers and  children of female members of the  armed forces.  -Married women who aid husbands in  escaping from crimes will be liable  to prosecution.  -National housing loan regulations now  consider married women as principal  purchasers.  -Women's volunteer experience is  included in evaluating qualifications  for federal employment; and full-time  household responsibilities are now  equated with labour force participation  in determining eligibility for  federal training allowances.  -The federal public service may not  discriminate on the basis of marital  status or age.  Other legislation is in the process  cf being enacted. Bill C-20,  to amend the Citizenship Act and give  Canadian mothers equal rights with  Canadian fathers in conferring  citizenship to their children, will  soon receive second reading.  Bill C-52, to give equal pension  rights to women in the federal  public service, armed forces, RCMP^  and female MPs9 is expected to ^  enacted in the near future. <gP  An amendment to the Criminal Code,  Bill C-71, will affect the handling  of rape cases, and is expected to  be passed before the end cf this year.  The provincial government passed one  bill pertaining to women in 1975.  Bill 75, the status of men and  women amendment act, removes  discriminatory references to women  from a number of acts.  To overcome,  'statutory slurs', the word "men"  has been replaced by "persons".  This Act has brought about other  changes.  -B.C. women can now work in open  pit mines.  -B.C. women can now exercise-racehorses..  -B.C. women can now assist peace  officers in extinguishing fires.  -B.C. women can now construct and  repair dykes.  -BcC. married women's residences  can be determined independently from  their husbands.  -Separate provisions for slander of  women in B.C. are abolished.  -B.C. mothers may now consent to the  cremation of stillborn children if  the husband is dead or unavailable.  -The curfew age of boys and girls is  now the same in B.C.    » -  -Acts governing the Department of  Highways and Public Works no  longer classify married women with  infants and lunatics.  All of which, if read very quickly,  sounds impressive. What, then, do  women still want?  The report of the Royal Commission  on the Status of Women, issued in  1970, contains most of the answers to  that question.  It contains 163  recommendations to improve the  status of women in Canada. Of the  122 recommendations coming under  federal jurisdiction, 73 have been  implemented over the last 5 years,  12 are before the House of Commons,  9 are being implemented administratively and 4 are under study.  The provincial government of  British Columbia has largely ignored  the Commission's recommendations  within its jurisdiction over the  last several years. Women in the  province have been asking for  affirmative action laws, better labor  maternity protection legislation,  community of property marital laws,  less restrictive day care regulations  and stricter amendments to the B.C.  Human Rights Code.  As Jo Lazenby, on staff at Vancouver  Status of Women, observes, "There  was a lot of talk during International Women's Year, but little action  by government. To the politically  naive, this was a grave disappointment; to other women, it was predictable."  "With the kind of legislation passed  on women's rights during 1975," she  adds, "compared with what we were  asking for and needed, it's hard to  believe in the government's  commitment to equality for women."  -Western Canadian Women's News,  December 15th, 1975  rough justice  Dr. Henry Morgenthaler has been released, in accordance with the judgement of the 24 ordinary Canadians  who said he should never have been  imprisoned.  The jury of one's peers has long  stood between us the people and laws  imposed upon us by an oppressive and  elitist minority — between us and  the conservatice, fearful legalists  who would enforce slavish obedience  to antiquated laws at the price of  common humanity. Twenty-four Canadian  people have judged Dr. Henry Morgenthaler humane rather than criminal.  Twelve more will now be asked to do  so. I have no doubt that these twelve  will also ohoose humanity over antiquated laws. But I also have no doubt  that Bill C-71, returning our right  to trial by jury, must be passed .  immediately, and that our antiquated  and arbitrary abortion laws must be  repealed.  - Lee Masters  DR. HENRY MORGENTALER  Lornex Mines  The B.C. Human Rights Commission has  ruled that Lornex Mines did practice  discrimination in conditions of employment in the case of Jean Tharp  (see November KINESIS, page 6).  VSW issued the following press release following the announcement of  the decision:  "In finding Lornex guilty of wanton  disregard of the Code, the board  demonstrated clearly that employers  must take the Code seriously," said  President Nancy Conrod.  "Further," she said,"the board's  common sense ruling that 'conditions  of employment' include all benefits  made available to employees, including such things as subsidized lodging,  will aid immensely in the battle to  eliminate discrimination against working women."  "We hope," she continued,"that this  decision will encourage all women in  British Columbia by showing them that  they do have recourse against discrimination even if the fight is long.  Most of all we hope this case may  serve as a beacon throughout Canada." 13  ASSERTIVENESS   TRAINING  Do you have difficulty saying "no"  to a persuasive salesman?  Do you  have trouble returning defective  merchandise?  Does telling a friend  that you can't meet him/her as  planned seem impossible without  phony excuses?  Do you feel guilty  if you want to say "no" to someone's  request for favors?  Many people find these and similar  situations uncomfortable or irritating  and seem at a loss for just the "right"  thing to say.  Assertiveness training  is designed to help people understand  what they feel, know what they want,  and express themselves clearly.  In  an assertion training group, assertive  aggressive and non-assertive behaviors  must be clearly differentiated.  Many women think that as women they  are "supposed to be" passive, non-  assertive, and subordinate; however,  they still wish they could feel better  about themselves.  Women who desire  to change their own behavior need skills  to break out of self-defeating patterns that keep their self-concept  low.  Women come to assertiveness training  groups to develop skills so that they  can improve their ability to communicate  effectively.  Each woman may be non-  assertive in some situations, be aggressive in others and be assertive in  still others.  Her goal would be to  increase the areas of her life where she  can be assertive.. One woman may need  to examine the situations in which she  is aggressive and practice ways in  which she can express her feelings  without hurting or depreciating others.  Another may need to learn how to present small reasonable complaints to.  prevent storing of grievances until  a blow up occurs.  Women who are consistently non-assertive may have somatic  complaints with a psychogenic origin  that could be alleviated by reducing  tension and anxiety resulting from inhibited reactions.  Assertiveness training helps a woman  to be strong and personally effective.  The program has three goals: (a) to educate the woman to her interpersonal  rights, (b) to overcome whatever blocks  exist to acting assertively, and (c)  to develop and refine assertive behavior through active practice methods.  Discussion is encouraged to help a woman  accept that her feelings and personal  rights do matter.  Each participant  presents specific situations from her  everyday life with which she is willing  to practice varying responses with  the counsellor.  A role play is designed to re hearse specific responsses  and the participant learns by doing  better each time she tries.  Her confidence increases and her anxiety about  the consequences decreases as she becomes more skilled in the new behavior.  When a person has the necessary  skills, she can choose her behavior  in situations with increased responsibility.  Being non-assertive may be  wise in some situations, but the ch0£ce  to be non-assertive can give a person  a healthy feeling of self worth.  Charlotte Atlung and I have been  leading Assertiveness Training Workshops for over a year now.  Besides  the format outlined above, two themes  run throughout our workshops.  First,  emphasis is placed on congruency between  verbal and non-verbal expression. For  example, a verbal "no" should not  be cancelled bv a non verbal "yes".  Second, the words spoken should be  congruent with the emotions felt. We  work to help group participants understand the feelings underlying a situation so that they can better express  themselves.  Assertiveness Training is one of several  workshop topics which we have designed  specifically for women's groups.  In  addition we have workshops for groups  of both women and men.  We have also  worked with women's centres to provide  staff training as well as community  workshops, and we are interested in  discussing possible workshops with  other women's centres.  If you would  like more information write one of  us and ask for a copy of our 1976  winter program.  Barbara Pendergast  350 Benjamin Road  Victoria BC  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?  VERBAL SELF-DEFENCE, EMOTIONAL SELF-  DEFENCE AND ASSERTIVENESS  As a counselor I've heard all three of  these terms frequently.  I've sure  you have too.  Why are they so popular, what do they mean and what's  the difference between them?  Verbal Self-Defence, Emotional Self-  Qefence and Assertiveness Training  have all arisen from the need of  women to gain skills to make changes  in their lives.  To me, it is natural  progression from examination of oneself  and society, often in C-R groups, to  a search for skills in order to feel  better-about oneself, have a more  satisfying relationships and be more  effective in one's life.  The three terms reflect a different  emphasis within the areas of self-  assertion.  From what I've read,  Verbal Self-Defence emphasizes the  learning of verbal skills in order  to better handle verbal put-downs.  The Vancouver Status of Women have  produced an informative handbook of  responses to put-downs such as :  "You're a cute chick" - "You need your  2yes checked, I'm a woman not a baby  animal" or"I'm not a mindless fuzzy  baby animal, I'm a thinking, responsible human being".  I know I have  felt angry at myself for not having  a response to such a comment.  I'm  sure you have too.  I have talked with women who lead  Emotional Self-Defence workshops and  with women who have participated in  Emotional Self-Befence workshops.  One  difference between Emotional Self-  Defence and Assertiveness Training  they have reported is simply the terms.  A group of women told me that Assertiveness Training sounds too strong  and frightens them. They fear it might  threaten their important relationships,  but they still wish to feel better  about themselves.  Therefore, Emotional  Self-Defence allows some women to learn  assertion skills which they might avoid  if only offered as Assertiveness Training  For me, Assertiveness Training is a  more encompassing term.  Yes, I am  changing my relationships by "just"  wanting to feel better about myself.  Yes, I am being assertive by not  letting the verbal put-down pass "just  one more time".  And yes, I can discover what I want and be able to  communicate it so that I don't need  to react from a defensive position.  My feelings and wants are important.  I can learn to express them while still  respecting the rights and wishes of  others.  Assertiveness Training  gives a woman skills to initiate and  not just respond.  The workshops Barbara Pendergast and  I lead integrate feelings and body  language into Assertiveness Training.  the unifying of the mind, body and  emotions is an important aspect of  our Assertiveness Training Workshops.  Starting FEBRUARY 16 for 6 MONDAY  EVENINGS I will be leading an  Assertiveness Training Workshop in  Vancouver.

Charlotte Atlung  1420 West 12  Vancouver BC  quote=  "One of the oldest and falsest of our  beliefs regarding women is that they  are protected—that some way in the  battle of life they get the best of  it." — Nellie McClung 14  In the last two issues of KINESIS  Susan Levin, a VSW member who has  returned to Israel to live, has  shared her personal observations on  the position of women in that country  with us. This is the last of Susan's  comments — for now. She extends an  invitation to women with comments or  questions or advice to write to her:  Susan Levin, 37 Shimoni Street,  Entrance B, Jerusalem, Israel.  MARRIAGE — Women in Israel may not  initiate divorce.Only the husband can  do this.  Regardless of her religious beliefs,  before the marriage ceremony a woman  must go to a ritual bath to he cleansed  of her last menstrual period.  ABORTION — Tens of thousands of  abortions are performed annually —  and expensively — by legitimate  doctors, but an official policy on  abortion would threaten Jewish law.  (The religious Jews have a political  party which represents, a minority  of the population of Israel but they  throw their political weight around  in coalition governments and exert  a lot of influence. It is a very  traditional party and its views on  women are far from progressive.  POLITICAL — In the Knesset (Israeli  parliament) there is one confirmed  feminist woman (she is from New York)  and another woman who refers to herself as a humanist, not a feminist,  but she consistently supports issues  that relate to women.  There is no Human Rights Commission  and so a great deal must be done before there will be an equal work-  equal pay situation.  w>&  ADVERTISING — A very depressing  trend I have noticed in the seven  years I have been back and forth to  Israel is the increasing use of women's bodies and sexuality to sell  products. It is very disappointing  to see Israel adopting the 'Madison  Avenue mentality' that North American  women are fighting to overcome.  WOMEN'S GROUPS — Women's groups as  such began abour. three years ago in  Haifa, then in Tel Aviv. And finally  in Jerusalem which is a more conservative city due to the large numbers  of traditionally religious people  living there. On the Jerusalem mailing list there are about 200 women  I have heard of several small groups  in Jerusalem and one in Beeshave.  These seem to begin as coffee klatches  and  evolved into groups interested  in women's political issues. The key  words are "heard of" because the  total lack of organization among women  is an enormous problem in Israel. We  know there are lots of women with  energy to devote — the problem is  communication. Prime Minister Rabin  promised money for IWY which we are  in deperate need of for organizing  — but he apparently forgot! Too  often in this country we have to  "wait 'til peace, comes". We've written to Rabin to remind him about the  money. But in the meantime Haifa  knows not what Jerusalem is doing.  A recent breakthrough is that just  recently we have been offered a huge  home to use as a meeting place here  in Jerusalem. In the meantime there  have been meetings in various women's  homes. One meeting I attended reflected the universal nature of this city  — women from Britain, U.S.A., South  America, France and Israel. When I  showed them copies of KINESIS with  the member groups and functioning  committees and such, they could have  cried.  So we are plodding along, unorganized,  without the communication and support  and knowledge of sister groups. We  keep writing letters about abortion,  Human Rights legislation, money —  but nothing yet.  For all the depressing things I have  described I must add that the press  in Israel appears to be quite open.  I have seen an excellent interview  with a feminist writer and two very  good programs on liberation in general  and working women. And just last night  I saw a play by five women full of  feminist insights and statements.  Israel is a warmly insane democratic  place — everyone makes sure s/he  gets heard. We, as women of the Middle  East, have to be heard. And we have  to listen too — I have heard of  Arab women's groups in Jerusalem and  Amman. If we ever get organized here,  contact with these women's groups is  a first priority. There is too little  time, and too much is at stake.  the politics of purses ....and pockets  Purses are a drag (in some cases  they are a 'drag') - not so much  the nice big ones you can throw  over your shoulder, or those with  sturdy handles and lots of space  so you can tote along the accouter-  ments necessary for dealing with  unexpected free time and impending  boredom (waiting in a gas station,  your cousin's party, bridal showers)  - magazines, notebooks, reading  books, crafts, etc. No, the ones  I mean are those silly things that  slip over your wrists, barely have  enough extra room or strength for  even a small paper-back, very often  made out of cheap imitation leather  plastic, designed for a short life;  the ones that women always seem to  De leaving behind somewhere at a  crucial moment; and the ones that  all the 'menfolk' (quite rightly)  love to make jokes about:  "They  can't find a thing in them.  They  have got six different kinds of  lipstick, several mirrors, a couple  of combs - but no pens or paper.  They weigh a ton, they've got junk  from years back - but she can't  find the house keys."  This kind of purse, and the lack  of decent pockets on women's clothing seem expressly designed for  difficulty.  It's a conspiracy.  Even "women's" wallets are absurd;  the change is all kept under a flap  that generally falls open at the  wrong time, and usually makes the  wallet too bulky to fit into a  pocket - even if you did have one.  And pockets, or the lack of them,  are a main point of contention with  me. Pockets are so handy, they're  always with you, you can't lose them  anywhere. You can usually find what  you're looking for in them, and they  don't fall apart on you all at once.  For the most part, women are barred  from these pragmatic pleasures. Why?  It seems that the nasty bulky things  spoil the "line" of women's clothes,  especially a pair of pants.  Now I  ask you, whatever happened to the  aesthetic value and pleasure in men's  There is nothing sadder than  imitation pockets in a pair of  pants or jacket.  They usually  send me screaming out of the store.  There is nothing worse than going  out to a party or nightclub and  either dragging a purse about with  you every time you move, or constantly worrying about where you've  left it. Purse-snatching is a pathetically simple and common crime,  especially perpretrated on elderly  women.  &-m  It is up to us to let manufacturers  and clothes designers know we don't  appreciate certain shackles of fashion. Like bad movies, we should stay  away from buying them in droves (make  your own). Women of Vancouver unite,  you have nothing to lose but your  Buxton's!  - J.

Think twice  about your reasons for shaving your  legs.  Does your boyfriend or husband  demand that vou shave your legs because  "he won't be seen with" or "won't  sleep with" a woman who has hairy  legs? Do you feel the pressure from  our society to believe that a woman  should have completely smooth and  hairless legs?  Possibly you shave under your arms  for the same reasons?  (Personally  I shave under my arms because it is  easier to keep that part of my body  clean.)  It is easy to be led into thinking  that it is right to have bare  underarms; that hair under a woman's  arms looks "revolting" and "dirty".  Are your reasons for using perfume  or strong deodorant because you are  afraid of your natural body scent and  because you believe that females are  supposed to smell like "flowers"?  It is socially acceptable for men to  grow hair anywhere on their bodies  that they choose. A man is not a  "man" if he wears perfume; if he does  not allow his bodily aroma to reach  the nostrils of all the "pretty young  maidens."  I am not portraying men as "the  enemy" responsible for "women's  strange unexplainable rituals"  but I am urging us as women, to be  aware that it is easy to continue  these "habits" not because we choose  but because we are "conditioned" to  believe and act according to society's  "female image." It is too easy to  become society's "soft, sweet, female  puppet."       —Jerrylee Cerny  pregnancy  In the last issue of KINESIS Rebecca  Georges complained of losing UIC  Maternity Benefits because she was so  abnormal as to have her baby earlier  than modern medicine predicted. Her  perdicament resulted from one of the  dumbest pieces of legislation ever to  grace the books. Not a regulation or  some bureaucrat's interpretation, but  the UIC statue itself, limited Maternity Benefits to 6 weeks following  delivery no matter what occured.  Happily, for people who have babies  in the future, the rules have been  changed, effective February 1, 1976.  The Omnibus Bill contained the change  — one accomplishment for IWY. We'can  thank people like Roslyn Kunin for  it. She has been recommending this  change ever since she first went to  work for UIC several years ago.  Henceforth,a woman who qualifies for  Maternity Benefits* may begin to  collect as early as 9 weeks before  her predicted date of confinement and  as late as 2 weeks following delivery  or anywhere in between. In all cases  she will receive 15 weeks of benefits.  It will no longer matter when the  baby is actually born. (The two week  waiting period between filing a claim  and receiving benefits will remain in  effect.)  This change offers little consolation  to people who suffered under the old  system. They can do little more than  hold out for an easy repayment schedule if required to pay back benefits.  And we all have to live with the  Government's message, "You should have  waited until 1976 to be 'abnormal!'"  *She must have worked 20 weeks in the  year before her claim and 10 of those  weeks must have been between the 50th  and 30th week before her predicted  date of confinement.  -Nancy Conrod  egal hints  The Vancouver Community Legal Assistance Society is issuing a monthly  bulletin of legal information and  has given us permission to reprint  the bulletins in KINESIS. This  month's topic is welfare appeals.  ARE WELFARE DECISIONS APPEALABLE?  Yes! There are times when a welfare  client is unhappy with the decision  of a social worker. It may be that  the social worker has turned down  a request for a special grant for  an emergency need or it may be that  the client has been turned down for  a handicapped allowance. All of these  decisions can be appealed.  HOW DO I APPEAL?  People in Vancouver go to your local  Community Resources Board and ask  for an appeal form HR 202. You fill  out the form and give it to the area  manager of the Community Resources  Board. People outside the Vancouver  area must send the appeal form to  the Regional Director in their area.  Remember you must appeal the decision  within 30 days.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  If you have been cut off welfare and  appeal, the area manager must put   ,  you back on welfare pending the outcome of the appeal. Then, the area  manager holds an informal hearing  and tries to resolve the matter within 10 days and if he cannot resolve  the dispute, the dispute goes to a  formal appeal.  WHAT IS A FORMAL APPEAL?  There is a three person appeal tribunal composed of a person, unrelated to you, selected by you; a person  who does not work for the government,  but selected by the welfare department; and a third person selected  by the other two persons. The tribunal hears your side of the dispute  and then the welfare department's  view. The tribunal then makes a  decision and can overrule the welfare department if .they feel the  department was wrong.  You can be represented at the welfare appeal hearing by a lawyer or  agent or representative. Remember,  this appeal procedure is for your  protection, use it!

Based  on three year's experience at K-W  WP, the pamphlet analyzes in depth  the problems of women's centres, and  gives possible solutions. It covers  the mythology of sisterhood, a structural proposal, consciousness-raising,  defining power, the service/educational  approach, defining ideology, collective organizing, demystifying leadership, uncritical support.

Following is a letter protesting a  T.V. commercial for Daisyfresh bras,  and a reply from the Canadian Advertising Standards Council. We do not  know if this commercial appears only  in the Vancouver area or if members  outside the Lower Mainland have seen  it as well.  Canadian Advertising Standards Council  1240 Bay Street,Suite #302  Toronto, Canada.  Dear Ms. Crandell:  Re: Daisyfresh Bra Ad  We wish to draw your attention to a  commercial for Daisyfresh bras currently broadcast on television in Vancouver .  An Englishman roams the countryside  in his old-fashioned prestige aristocratic roadster and stops to pick-up  some women to go off on a Sunday drive.  During the entire commercial two models clad only in bras are superim  During the entire commercial two  models clad only in bras are superimposed on the scene. At the end the  upper-class man eclaims that Canadian  women have good taste in bras, or  something similar.  According to the study conducted by  the Ontario Status of Women Council  last year, some 8% of all women's  objections to advertising involve  invasion of privacy and public exposure of intimate products. This ad is  a perfect example.  If Daisyfresh must advertise bras in  public (we would prefer to see them  only in women's media), we urge them  not to show men passing judgement on  women's choice of bras. We are fed  up with having to conform to male  standards of beauty.  We doubt that ads portraying women  commenting on the attributes of jockstraps (the male equivalent of the f  foundation garment) would be allowed  on air and we are certainly not advocating equal opportunity in that  regard.  Nor are we advocating that advertisers  become more modest in female commer*-  cials. What we are objecting to are  ads which portray women as sex-objects.  The consumer is led to believe women  will be more attractive sexually by  wearing Daisyfresh. A non-sexist ad  would appeal to women only on the  basis of comfort and support. If  the bra makes us more attractive,  let it be a standard of beauty which  we judge for ourselves.  We would like to know what your council plans for the future broadcasting  and publication of further intimate  female products and would appreciate  your reply. Than you.  Karen Richardson  cc. Daisyfresh  B.C. Human Rights Commission  Dear Karen:  Thank you for your letter concerning  a television commercial advertising  Daisy Fresh bras. You may have read  some of the recent newspaper articles  announcing that the Canadian Advertising Advisory Board has established  a Task Force to study the portrayal  of women in advertising.  The first meeting of the Task Force  will be held late in January and ads  of the type referred to in your letter  may be included in our areas of study.  I am not sure at this point what  specific recommendations the Task  Force will make, but it is possible  that a set of guidelines for advertisers may well emerge as a final result. There is also the possiblility  that we will be able to incorporate  a clause rrlating to this area in  advertising, in the Code of Advertising Standards, but at this time I  cannot give you a definite answer to  your question, as to what the Council  plans for future advertising of intimate female products.  Again thanks for writing us.

I knew you were working on these projects and I was anxiously awaiting  their completion. Like many other  women, I am stuck in a lousy job .  under the employ of the "All-Mighty"  male. I resent being called "Dear"  or "Sweetie" by these self-proclaimed  super studs, but I fail to come up  with a quick come-back. Hopefully  your Verbal Self-Defense book has my  answer.  I am also glad the mail strike is  over as I missed my monthly issue  of Kinesis.  Keep up the great work.and thanks a  lot.  Sincerely,  Ramona Gowler  Enclosed is my membership donation  for the year 75/76.  Sorry that it's  late - blame it on the post office.  I really look forward to getting  my Kinesis every month, of course, alot  of the contents are irrelevant to  me here, but I get alot out of the  articles with 'Universal Woman'  appeal.  International Women's Year got  started here rather late. At the  moment there is an exhibit at  City Hall of 100 women and their  'careers'. One of the women's  claim to fame is that she has worked  at the same restaurant for 14 years-  a notable achievement, I agree! The  other profiles run from the first  female parliamentarian of Bermuda, to  the only female welder. You must keep  in mind, however, that there are only  50,000 people on the Island. We did  have a representative in Mexico, this  year, though.  I don't feel qualified, after having  been here little over a year, to  render an opinion on the lot of the  Bermudian woman.  From outside appear-  KINESIS:  Thanks for your reminder that my  membership had expired.  Enclosed is  my membership.  I must admit to being somewhat  ambivalent about your publication  after reading Nancy Conrad's  editorial in the December issue.  An economy strangled by inflation  is no more likely to help the feminist  cause than a frozen economy, in fact,  I see more possibility of juggling  the distribution of funds in a  tight, stable economy than in a  frightened, fluctuating one.  Instead  of screaming about being the scapegoat, lets be vocal in making  constructive criticisms.  I don't  believe that women should be  apolitical in their fight for  equality, but I also don't believe  for a minute that any specific  party allegiance, capitalist or  socialist, will ensure equality.  Fortunately, on the whole your  information is objective and  informative and, therefore, I'd hate  to let my subscription lapse.  If I want the socialist point of  view the N.D.P. Women's organization  publication Priorities is hard to  beat!  Keep up your good work.  Linda Kennedy  ances, it appears not to be a happy  one.  Bermudian women do not have a  choice between working outside or  inside the home.  The economy here is  such that very few Bermudian women  do not work outside the home, at  the least, at one job.  Combine  this with the fact that a very great  number of households are headed by  a female (ie. single parent) and  you get a slight idea of the  situation.  During the day, under  school-age children stay with older  relatives or in day care centres.  Bermudians enjoy a high standard of  living, but they really pay for it,  financially and  otherwise.  The single parent association is  working to get the legal minimum  monthly child support payment  raised from $10.00. A rape crisis  centre was started but receives littl<  'support as most people grin at the  word 'rape'. There have been  three rape cases in court since we  moved here - all three boys (and they  were just boys) got off because  promiscuity (so-called) of females  is so common! The whole thing sets  my teeth on edge.  Joyce Walker,  BERMUDA  neseanch centne  B.C. WOMEN'S STUDIES RESEARCH CENTRE  The B.C.

Women's Studies Research  Centre has just published a book,  Women Look at Psychiatry, and made  a videoprogramme on the Canadian  Suffragists.  izzys  e  Way back in November of 1974, I wrote  a letter to KINESIS about how I felt  that women between 45 and 60 are  "forgotten." I got back a very encouraging letter suggesting that I  might be interested in writing something for KINESIS on a fairy regular  basis as one of these "forgotten  women."  O.K. Now I've decided to. (My grandfather wrote a column for a small  newspaper in a district of London,  so I think I've inherited the knack.)  I feel that we menopausals(who are  supposedly in need of a change of  occupation) have lots to say, and  perhaps we can be of some help to  women who are approaching this period.  Sure, we can get help from our doctors about the physical changes, but  what about having to cope with men,  sex, work...?  I see the column as partly biographical and partly philosophical — strong ■  and to the point!  Maybe those of the KINESIS readers  who are in this age group and I could  get together and exchange ideas. Sort  of bounce ideas and suggestions off  each other. To quote Margaret Kuhn,  founder of the Gray Panthers, "There's  no disgrace or shame in growing old.  The problem is how to deal with it."  Now there's a right on woman!

Approximately 100 people attended to vote  on whether or not VSW would affiliate  with the British Columbia Federation  of Women and to hear the panel of  three speakers — Gene Errington,  Julia Goulden and Penny Fuller.  The members present voted unanimously  to affiliate with the BCFW as of Jan.  1st, 1976.  The short addresses of the three women on the panel led to a great many  questions and lively discussion.

URGENT_NOTICE TO_ALL_MEMBERS_OF THE VANCOUVER SJATUSjDF WOMEN FEB/76_  On Monday, March 8 (International Women's Day) the Vancouver Status of  Women will be participating along with other B.C. women's organizations in  a massive lobby/action in Victoria. It is being called -  !!!!!WOMEN RALLY FOR ACTION!!!!!!!  At present, over 30 women's organizations are involved in the planning and  staging of this action.  Plans include;  setting up an office outside the  Legislature on March 8, from this office our LOBBYING TEAMS will head into  the Parliament Buildings to keep their appointments with every M.L.A,.  (appts being set up now) and present him/her with a brief on the issues of  concern to women in B.C. and hundreds of letters from the M.L.A.'s constituents concerning women's issues in that riding.  Questions will be  asked, points will be raised, dialogue will be held and each lobbying team  will evaluate the M.L.A.'s response and note it on a huge billboard we plan  to have set up outside the building.  Plans also include day long speeches,  etc outside the Parliament Buildings, support demonstrations in Victoria,  Vancouver and other centres where women want to gather.  Our purpose? To bring home to the government the fact that the women's  movement is not a "pie in the sky" movement, that women all over the province care about things like non-sexist education for their children, access  to daycare centres, community of property in marriage, core funding for  women's centres, a better Maternity Protection Act, Affirmative Action  plans etc. We want each M.L.A. to understand that the women's movement  is not just an urban phenomena, it is growing, surging throughout the whole  province, especially in his/her riding.  THE HELP OF V.S.W. MEMBERS IS NEEDED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:  1. Participation - committees have been struck for billeting, visual aids,  construction, food and sanitary, transportation, lobbying, entertainment,  local demonstrations, media,  PORT COQUITLAM AREA W0MEN"S CENTRE is handling-  all the communications to women's centres/groups in B.C.  Call them or the  V.S.W. office and you'll be given the name of the committee coordinator  you want.  (Pt Coq - 941-6311, P.O. Box 243, Pt. Coquitlam/V.S.W. 736-3746)  2. Money - if you don't have the time or the energy to spare, but wish to  support this action (we need supplied, $$ for air fares for women from the  North etc ) please send $$$. Make cheques payable to the Vancouver Status  of Women, and NOTE ON THE CHEQUE THAT THIS MONEY IS FOR THE WOMEN"S RALLY  FOR ACTION.  It will be cashed and put to work towards success on March 8.  3. Letters - as well as the brief on issues of concern to women in B.C.  each lobbying team will give the M.L.A. what we hope will be boxes of  letters from his/her constituents regarding issues of concern to WOMEN OF  HIS/HER RIDING. We need YOU to write these letters - the actions taken in  Victoria won't mean a thing unless the M.L.A. thinks and knows that women  in their riding are concerned about them too.  So here's what to do -  address your letter paper to  (name), M.L.A., Parliament Buildings, Victoria,  write about things you think are important to women, about problems women  have in your local area, voice support for the Women's Rally for Action,  for continuation of Prov. Coord, of Status of Women office, for continuation  of Provincial Advisory Cttee on Sex Discrimination in Education - WHATEVER  MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU WRITE IT DOWN!!!  Then pop it into an envelope  and mail to the Vancouver Status of Women office, 2029 West 4th Avenue,  Vancouver. We will coordinate the letters for presentation to the M.L.A.'s  OUT OF TOWN MEMBERS NOTE—we have women on the lobbying committee responsible for contacting women's centres/groups all over the province—if you  want to do more, call your nearest women's centre and ask about the MARCH  8 WOMEN RALLY FOR ACTION - or call/write us immediately at the office and  we can help.
