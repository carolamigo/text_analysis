V<S rQe Uo.lt l'9 € V-  Dead Men Don't Rape 22  DEC/JAN 2000 update from the downtown eastside:  shawna turned 16 last week, she's from  prince george and has been working the  streets in the downtown eastside for about  a year, last week, John doe, a white,  middleclass lawyer in his fifties 'got ugly  with her', she wouldn't elaborate, just kept  repeating those words to herself, sitting in  a doorway, tweaking on crack, out there,  flying, somewhere far away from the Johns  who pick her up off the corner of jackson  and cordova, across the street from my  house, i hate John doe. everyday, countless  times, i watch the cars stop, sex workers,  predominantly native, many of whom are  very young like shawna, get in, are driven  off. i try not to think about what happens  next, but i always wonder if they will be  safe, ii they will be back, or if another poster  will go up instead, i hate John doe but  shawna is of legal age to have 'consensual'  sex with him. mr. John doe/lawyer knows  this too. when shawna got her hiv test back  and found out she was positive—a gift from  her pimp/dealer/boyfriend—i was horrified, now i hope mr. John doe/lawyer  didn't use a condom, i don't even worry  too much about his wife, kids, right now i  just hate John doe.  shawna and i both live in the downtown eastside. we are both native and many  of the experiences which led her to the street  parallel mine and yet i have not had to go  there, nor do i live in poverty or face the  dimension of violence she does, i have  much to be grateful for and i need to thank  the creator for this everyday.  native women's lives and experiences  cannot be homogenized, to paraphrase one  of the contributors to this issue: we are too  different, to generalize would be disrespectful, this is not to say that we have no common concerns and immediate needs or that  there is no reason for us—as native women  —to organize together, on the contrary, it is  crucial at this time where native women's  voices still do not resonate to the extent that  they should.  this paper represents an attempt to  gather and give space to a sampling of the  many initiatives put forth by native women  in 'canada' today, in a kaleidoscope of articles authored by native women, important  points are made which need to be discussed  on a broader level in our communities, sara  hunt, for example, addresses the situation  of native sex workers and problematizes the  lack of responsibility, in particular on the  part of the male leadership towards these  women, it is time to break through the stig-  matization and shame which prevents us  from supporting native prostitutes who  face a life threatening situation everyday.  it is also vital that we begin to speak  openly about the conditions of violence in  our communities, that many native women  use the streets to escape from, too many  perpetrators go about their business unchallenged, too many women and children  suffering sexualized violence at their hands  are silenced. We need to create conditions  in which native and all women/lesbians...  are able to take control of their bodies and  how they use them.  the task of guest-editing this special  issue has been both exciting and frightening, now, close to press- time, it is good to  see 32 pages of 'feministnewspaper' filled  with native women's words, this should  not stop here, many of the pieces invite response and discussion, discussion which is  badly need.  my thanks to the contributors for your  stories and inspiration and to all the other  women/lesbians who were a part of this: i  am deeply grateful, but i can't begin to  name you because i'm all out of space.  all my relations  Our appreciation to the following supporters who became members of VSW, renewed  their memberships, or who made donations during the month of November.

The end of 1999 is upon  us! Millennium fever surrounds us, but  what excites us even more is that this is  Kinesis' first Aboriginal Women's Issue.  And, it leaves millennium fever looking like  last year's party!  This special issue fits within a long,  tangled herstory of neglect and silencing  of Aboriginal women's voices in feminist  discourse, challenge of policies and participation in the paper's development by Aboriginal women, and gradually, particularly  over the 1990s, a sense of ownership of Kinesis by Aboriginal women activists in Vancouver and nationally.  Then in the early 1990s, Miche Hill of  the Mi'kmaq Nation, became the first Aboriginal woman to hold a full-time staffing  position at the VSW. Miche worked actively  with the Kinesis editor in ensuring consistent coverage of news more directly relevant  to Aboriginal women. By 1994, now-United  Native Nations president Viola Thomas  was invited to guest-edit Kinesis' first-ever  Aboriginal women's supplement.  In 1995, the fresh insight, enthusiasm  and activism of spankin' new Kinesis editor Agnes Huang enabled the paper to further build upon the work of Aboriginal  feminists and open up the pages oiKinesis  in unprecedented ways to coverage of issues relevant to and by Aboriginal women.  This was further strengthened by the creation of the Aboriginal Women's Action  Network in late 1995, which sprang from  the initiative of then-VSW staffer Terry  Netsena of the Tahltan Nation and Fay  Blaney of the Homalco Nation.  Out of discussions with AWAN sprung  the idea of a guest-edited Native Women's  Issue to lead us into a new millennium and  a new chapter inKinesis' herstory. The guest  editor Audrey Huntley is also a key member of AWAN's Bill C-31 Project [see page  7.] She has done an amazing job of pulling  together articles from across this land, from  a diverse range of Aboriginal women, and  under the restraints of never having produced a newspaper before!  Audrey is of Anishinawbe, German  and Euro-Canadian descent. She returned  to Turtle Island in 1998 after living in Europe for 17 years, with most of the last 12  years in Germany (with frequent trips to  Italy to "save her sanity") While living in  Marburg, she worked within the feminist  autonomist and anti-imperialist movements for social change, and critiqued the  romanticization of First Peoples and the  appropriation of Indigenous culture.  Audrey has also authored a book,  Widerstand Schreiben! (Writing Resistance).  She hopes that the book along with her  translations of Indigenous women's literature (Jeannette Armstrong's Slash and a  collection of poetry by Chrystos) will contribute to deconstructing German notions  of 'Imaginary Indians' while calling attention to the on-going reality of genocide and  colonization.  Her determination, creativity and commitment have been key to the success of  Kinesis' Native Women's Issue. We'd like  to express our thanks to and her beautiful  canine 'editorial assistant' Morty. No you  can't chew on the paper Mort!  This issue not only ends the millennium, it is also the last issue with Agnes  Huang as Editor.  Yes, Agnes is finally leaving!!! And a  sad farewell it is.  Agnes joined Kinesis a zillion years ago  in 1990, as a writer and production volunteer. Within a month, she was breathing  new life and fire into the Ed Board. (Yes,  she's an Earth sign, but a Fire Horse too!)  Despite factors that made continuing  to produce a national feminist newspaper  a sometimes impossible-seeming task,  Agnes continued to churn out Kinesis year  after year. And while the pressures did  sometimes get to her and there were hard  times that called for Kinesis' loyal community of past staffers and volunteers to step  in, Agnes always did a magnificient job of  ensuring the paper's survival!  The powerful stories Kinesis carried  during Agnes' years as editor are too numerous to mention.  Most recently, Agnes has been instrumental in ensuring Kinesis does not ignore  the racist and classist backlash against the  Chinese women refugees from Fujian, who  have been incarcerated in BC prisons [see  Kinesis, Oct/Nov 1999]. Kinesis has been a  powerful tool in making links between corporate globalization, anti-immigrant policies, trafficking in women and government  trade negotiations.  Among things Agnes will be most  missed for is her irrepressible charm, enthusiasm and good spirits (not to suggest  she didn't have some crabby days!)  While her main focus is to recuperate  from the rigours of running the only national feminist newspaper in Canada,  Agnes has promises she will continue to sit  on the Editorial Board. It makes us all very  happy to have ongoing opportunities to  thank and appreciate her for her years of  commitment, courage and perseverance as  this paper's editor.  Meanwhile, we should let you know  that Kinesis has not found new editor for  the paper with the right balance of skills,  experience and political commitment. The  search continues and the Ed Board is working with VSW's Coordinating Collective to  work out a solution to continue publishing  the next issue without a full-time editor at  the helm.  December is usually a hard time to find  volunteers who will come in, but as soon  as we put the word out about the importance of this month's issue, a whole bunch  of fabulous volunteers showed up. An  enormous welcome and thank you to new  production volunteers, Helen Haig-Brown  and Jennifer Dysart. And, of course, a big  thank you to the rest of our faithful production volunteers who come in month after month (see masthead).  We'd also like to welcome all the new  writers/voices who contributed to this Native Women's Issue: Andrea Walsh,  Lizabeth Hall, Sandra Gray, Susan Beaver,  Bonita Lawrence, Anna Sewell, Crystal Lee  Clark, Theresa Marshall, Sarah Hunt, Vera  M. Wabegijig, Abby Cote, Kim Anderson,  Dian LeClair, Lynda Gray, Christine Welsh,  Alanaise Ferguson, Vivian Stogan, Anna  Hunter, Wendy, Valerie Inglis and Handan  Acabay. Thanks to all.  So, until next time, we'd like to wish  you an extremely Happy New Year and  happy reading. We're sure you'll be just as  thrilled with this issue as we are!! See you  in 2000!  DEC/JAN 2000 News   Supreme Court of Canada decision on Corbiere v. Canada:  Off-reserve voting a right  by Anna Hunter  Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian  and Northern Affairs), a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada handed down on  May 20, offers substantial changes to band  council election practices that will impact  First Nations communities across the country. The court's ruling directs the federal  government to initiate changes to the Indian Act within 18 months that will allow  off-reserve band members to vote in band  elections for chief-and-council.  The case involves voting restrictions  arising from Section 77 of the Indian Act—  this section says that only band members  "ordinarily resident on the reserve" are  entitled to vote in band elections.  The case was launched by four members of the Batchewana Indian Band, each  on their own behalf and on behalf of all  non-resident members of the Batchewana  Indian Band, which is located near Sault  Ste. Marie, Ontario. [The case is named after  John Corbiere, one of the four members who  filed the court challenge.JThe four members  argued that S. 77 violates the equality rights  provision (Section 15) of the Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In their court action, they were joined  by a number of intervenors. [Intervenors are  other parties—usually organizations or government bodies—which have a stake in the outcome of the case.] The intervenors in the  Corbiere case were: Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto, Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, Lesser Slave Lake Indian Regional  Council, Native Women's Association of  Canada, and the United Native Nations  Society of British Columbia.  In its decision, the Supreme Court  ruled that S. 77 in its entirety is unconstitutional. One important note is that, in ruling on the section "in its entirety," the Court  looked at the general application of the legislation, not just its application to the  Batchewana Indian Band. This means the  court's decision applies to the election rules  of all bands across Canada which follow  the Indian Act election rules.  Throughout its decision, the Supreme  Court offers recognition of the unique status of First Nations women. Justice Claire  L'Heureux-Dube, who wrote concurring  reasons with the majority decision, clearly  notes that First Nations women have been  severely disadvantaged by the Indian Act.  She states: "Aboriginal women, who  can be said to be doubly disadvantaged on  the basis of both sex and race, are particularly affected by differential treatment of  off-reserve band members."  Justice L'Heureux-Dube also outlines  the role that Bill C-31 has played in terms  of the dramatic increase in the number of  off-reserve members. Bill C-31, passed in  1985, restored "Indian status" to women  who lost their status because they married  non-Native or non-status men. [While Bill  C-31 was a step in the right direction, it created a whole host of other problems for Aboriginal women and their descendants. See  Pages 7 and 8.]  For the Batchewana and many other  bands, the majority growth in band membership since 1985 has been people who re/  gained Indian status and band membership  because of Bill C-31. Because funding from  Department of Indian Affairs (the federal  government) has not increased to compensate for the increase in band members,  many of these members have been left without access to programs and services, such  as on-reserve housing and education and  health funds.  Although the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling gives Aboriginal band members  living off-reserve the right to vote in band  elections and calls on the federal government to change the Indian Act, the situation is far from settled in most communities.  Across Canada, only 288 (of more than  650) bands still follow the election procedures set out in the Indian Act. The rest have  chosen to follow the band's customary election practices.  There is no certainty as to how communities with custom-based elections will  respond to the new direction ordered by the  Supreme Court. Nonetheless, the decision  offers positive support to Aboriginal people living off-reserve in their fight towards  ending discriminatory practices against  them.  The full text of the Corbiere decision  can be found on the Internet at: http://  www.droit.umontreal.ca/doc/csc-scc.  Anna Hunter has strong community and family ties to the Ktunaxa Nation in the Kootenays.  She is currently teaching First Nations Women's Studies at Malaspina University College  in Nanaimo, British Columbia. She studies law  and public administration at the University of  Victoria.  It was a victory not only for Mary  Vicky Scrimbitt, but for all so-called Bill  C-31 Indians.  On October 19, a federal court judge  ruled that the Sakimay Indian Band in  Saskatchewan had broken the law when  it denied Scrimbitt the right to vote in  band council elections. [The case is referred to as Mary Scrimbitt v. Canada.]  Scrimbitt lost her Indian status in  1971 and regained it in 1985. She says  she was treated as a band member since  the early 1990s. Scrimbitt even ran as a  candidate for council in 1991 and was  given use of some reserve land (near  Grenfell) in 1992.  However, things changed in 1993.  Scrimbitt was told by the band council  that she was off the voters' list. She was  told the same thing again in 1993 and  1995, even though the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) confirmed she was a  band member.  At trial, the Sakimay Band Council  argued that Scrimbitt could only be a full  band member if the band council voted  to accept her as a member, regardless  of what DIA said. It also argued it was  following the policies of the Assembly of  First Nations (AFN) and the Federation  of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN)  concerning band membership.  In upholding Scrimbitt's rights,  Judge Andrew MacKay said the Sakimay  Band Council had violated the Indian Act,  its own band membership code, and the  Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms. He added that the policies of  the AFN and the FSIN were not law.  [information from the Saskatchewan  Star Phoenix, October 22, 1999]  Interview with Marilyn Buffalo, president of the NWAC:  The voices of Native women  by Anna Hunter  One of the intervenors in the Corbiere case  was the Native Women's Association of Canada  (NWAC). Over its lifetime, NWAC has been  involved in many court challenges involving  recognition of the rights of Aboriginal people,  especially Aboriginal women. Anna Hunter  had the opportunity to interview NWAC's current president Marilyn Buffalo about her work,  and NWAC's involvement in the Corbiere case  and other political arenas.  Anna Hunter: Can you start by telling  us a little about your personal journey that  led you to becoming president of the Native Women'sAssociation of Canada in June  1997?  Marilyn Buffalo: I have about 30 years  of experience in doing community development. I have worked with and for our  people all my life which has prepared me  for the issues I deal with on a national basis. I have worked in education, health,  youth and policy development at all levels, and in many communities: urban,  northern, and on- and off-reserve.  Prior to working with NWAC, I was a  policy advisor to the Assembly of First Nations and before that, I was the National  Director for Aboriginal Policy for the Liberal Party of Canada. So far, I have been in  Ottawa for six years and it has been a really good experience for me.  Hunter: What are some of the notable  changes that have taken place in NWAC  under your leadership?  Buffalo: One notable change is that  there is more involvement in NWAC. I  think Aboriginal people are more focused  in trying to include Aboriginal women in  their policy development. It is true in some  cases, but there is still some resistance.  NWAC has also made some positive contributions in helping to change some of the  negative stereotypes of Native women in  Canada. Hopefully, we have set the pace  for more changes in the future.  Hunter: What are some personal highlights of your leadership role?  Buffalo: Getting involved with the  other Aboriginal leaders and coordinating  some of the key areas. Also, when NWAC  took a lead in January 1998 during the release of the Royal Commission of Aboriginal Peoples' report. We refused to accept  the "non-apology" to Aboriginal peoples  relating to residential schools, because it  didn't go far enough. The federal govern  ment offered Aboriginal people a very well-  worded legal document that basically  meant nothing more than an expression of  regret.  Hunter: Why is NWAC needed?  Buffalo: NWAC's role is to ensure that  the voices of Native women are heard. We  should be at every senior policy discussion  to ensure that the aspects of womanhood  are included, to make sure that issues regarding children are expressed and  prioritized, and that we uphold the matri-  lineal society.  NWAC will be needed for many years  to come. It will be a long time before we  achieve gender equality for Native women  in our communities. This is not just within  our own communities, but in mainstream  society as well. It is clear that there is still a  lot of racism and systemic discrimination  within all levels of government. The role  of Native women will become more prominent in the future, in the very near future  and I think that this is a very good thing.  Hunter: What was NWAC's role in the  Corbiere decision?  Buffalo: NWAC's work has been instrumental. For 12 years, we worked on  getting the Corbiere case through all levels  of the judicial system, all the way to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  In terms of the effects of the Corbiere  decision, it is far-reaching in terms of the  right to benefits and access to services for  our people living off-reserve. For too long,  our rights have been defined for us only  within the boundaries of our reservations.  The long term positive effects are going to  mean that governments are going to have  to negotiate with us in a different way, and  it is going to give us more leverage.  In terms of the reserves that are under  customary election practices, it doesn't  matter what type of election law they have.  The right for people to vote is there. The  onus is on the band leadership to get more  funds [to support the growing number of  members.] Pressure from our people is going to be greater. And governments have  to stop being so stingy.

DEC/JAN 2000  SIS News   Compensation awarded for a share in the family home:  A question of possession  by Vivian Stogan  In 1992, it was a precedent setting case in  BC. Seven years later, Vivian Stogan is still  waiting for this "first" to have any real meaning. The case is known as ]ames Joseph George  v. Vivian Mary George (now Stogan).  This case is significant because, for the first  time, a Native man was ordered to compensate  his former wife for her interest in their family  home on his reserve, even though he did not  have a certificate of possession (CP).  [A CP gives a person title to property  on reserve land. It is granted by the Department of Indian Affairs with the approval  of the band council. A CP allows a person  to own the house or other structures on the  property, but not the land. The land is  owned by the Crown in perpetuity. A CP  can be transferred to another band member with a band council resolution and approval of the minister of Indian Affairs.]  While Vivian Stogan's case focuses on  monetary compensation in the division of matrimonial property, two Native women's organizations have pushed the matter futher by filing constitutional challenges against the federal government. The British Columbia Native  Women's Society and the Native Women's  Association of Canada both claim that, with  respect to the division of matrimonial property,  the federal government has a fiduciary duty to  uphold the equality rights of Aboriginal women  [see sidebars.]  Here below, we present Vivian Stogan telling the story of her own fight.  InAugust 1992,1 was granted a divorce  from my first husband. He is a status Indian and a registered member of the  Burrard Band. I too, am a status Indian and  a registered member of the Squamish Band.  After the BC Supreme Court heard our  case, it ordered my ex-husband to pay me  spousal maintenance in the sum of $400 per  month, beginning on September 1, 1992.  The maintenance payments were to be reduced one dollar for every dollar of gross  income I earned over $1,000 a month.  The court further ordered my ex-husband to pay me $88,015 for my interest in  our former family home on the Burrard  Reserve on Dollarton Highway. We had  been married 28 years and had spent almost 20 years living in that home.  Because my ex-husband did not have  a certificate of possession (CP) for our  home, the court instead ordered him to pay  me $500 a month until the total sum of  $88,015 had been paid off. (Although the  band had approved his application for a  CP, it had never issued him one.)  The then Burrard Band Chief-and-  Council decided to get involved after the  BC Supreme Court's decision. My ex-husband appealed- the court's ruling and the  band intervened.  Specifically, the Burrard Band was trying to appeal the part of the Supreme  Courf s decision which addressed whether  possession of property on reserve, in the  absence of a CP, could constitute "lawful  possession." If it did, then it was legal to  have awarded me compensation under the  Family Relations Act—the provincial legislation that governs division of matrimonial  property upon divorce.  At trial, I had argued that my ex-husband had a "life interest" in our family  home—that is, he had the right to use and  occupy the house for the rest of his life. The  judge agreed and concluded that my ex-  husband was "lawfully in possession" of  the property based on the evidence of occupancy and usage.  My ex-husband's appeal was dismissed. I had won again!  In the ruling, one of the appeal court  justices stated: "Compensation in lieu of a  division of property is not a matter for  which provision is made under the Indian  Act, and in my view there is no inconsistency or 'actual conflict' between such a  provision for compensation between  spouses and the Indian Act."  The court agreed there was ample evidence to support the trial judge's conclusion that the Burrard Band Council had  approved the allocation of the property to  my ex-husband, regardless of the fact that  the allocation had originally been made,  not through the Band Council, but through  his relatives.  Here's one example of the evidence  introduced which shows that my ex-husband was in "possession" of our family  home: When our house was first built  through the Department of Indian Affairs  (DIA) in 1970, there was no cement floor.  We applied for financing through the  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). In the documentation of our  loan with CMHC, my ex-husband agreed  that if we defaulted on our payments three  months in a row he would assign to the  Burrard Band "his right, title and  interest...to the said land held in possession  by [him]" for as long as the loan remained  unpaid.  From this and other evidence, the court  concluded that, even though we did not  have a CP, "it would be difficult for a Band  Council...to assert successfully that [my ex-  husband] is not entitled to continued use  and occupancy of the property."  Because my ex-husband was in possession of our house and property, the Court  of Appeal agreed that it was lawful for the  trial judge to have granted me half of the  value of our house and property upon our  divorce.  The Court of Appeal's decision was  issued in November 1997. Two years later,  I am still waiting for my ex-husband to  honour the court's ruling. I am still trying  to get the Burrard Band to compensate me  for my share of the home I lived in for more  almost two decades.  My ex-husband lost at the BC Supreme  Court; my ex-husband and the Burrard  Band lost at the Court of Appeal. The right  thing for them to do would be to pay me  my share of the house and property set out  by the Supreme Court—$88,015—plus interest from August 28,1992, when the judgment was handed down.  The Burrard Band Chief-and-Council  at the time took it upon themselves to get  involved in my case by applying for  intervenor status and helping pay the  cost(s) of that appeal. When they lost, they  were ordered to pay for all court and lawyer costs.  Shortly after the first court decision, my  ex-husband quit his well-paying job as a  longshoreman—a job he had held for 20  plus years. To date, I have received just  $4,000 from him—taken from his income  tax return in the first year after the BC Supreme Court judgment.  Because of this, I am asking the Burrard  Band to settle out-of-court with me for my  share of our former family house. The  Burrard Band has the ways and means to  compensate me because it receives good  revenue from the town-houses, et cetera that  exist on its reserves. Also, every band in  Canada has capital and revenue dollars  held in trust in Ottawa on their behalf.  I was informed by someone at DIA that  the Burrard Band could ultimately do up a  band council resolution instructing DIA to  do just what I have suggested. DIA would  then get those dollars from Ottawa on behalf of the Burrard Band and buy my share  of the house and property.  This, to me, would be the most viable  way of doing things and getting this issue  brought to an end!  Vivian Stogan was born and raised in the  Squamish Nation.

Native women lose homes  under Indian Act rules  "We can't seem to get the government's attention without a writ in our back  pocket," Jane Gottfriedson said at a press  conference on March 19, 1997.  Gottfriedson, president of the BC Native  Women's Society, was announcing her organization's federal court action against  the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs.  Their claim: the Indian Act discriminates against Aboriginal women who live  on reserves by not allowing them to have  a share in their matrimonial home or an  order of exclusive possession, when their  marriages break up. Every other married  woman in the country has those rights.  In its suit, BCNWS charges that this  differential treatment violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The  Society says the federal government has  a constitutional obligation to protect the  equality rights of Aboriginal women.  BCNWS also argues that the federal  government has a fiduciary responsibility  to Aboriginal women which it cannot  download to the bands. BCNWS wants  the federal government to be restricted  from signing any agreement with Indian  bands related to land management until  its case is settled.  The BCNWS challenge is unique because it asserts that the federal government must take women's equality rights  into account when forming Aboriginal  policy. If BCNWS is successful, the federal government will not be able to  download land management on reserve to  Indian bands, without having first ensured  that women's equality rights, with respect  to the matrimonial home, are protected.

NWAC picks up  Bill C-49 fight  June 15,1999: Within days of then  Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs  Jane Stewart's introduction of Bill C-49  into the House of Commons, the Native  Women's Association of Canada filed its  lawsuit against the minister.  In its statement of claim to the federal court, NWAC argues that the provisions in the Indian Act relating to the division of matrimonial property rights and Bill  C-49, also known as the First Nations  Land Management Act (FNLMA), discriminate against Aboriginal women and their  children.  Bill C-49 would allow the federal government to download its responsibility for  the management of land on reserves to  First Nations (Indian bands). The First Nation would then be required to adopt a land  code. However, the FNLMA does not set  out any standards against which the land  codes would be measured.  This means that the "Legislation effectively leaves the matter of protection  of First Nations women's matrimonial  property rights in the hands of each signatory band, requiring only that bands not  discriminate between sexes," says NWAC  president Marilyn Buffalo. "This will result  in uncertainty, as no common standards  will be available."  Bill C-49 passed through the House  of Commons this fall, and is now before  the Senate. The federal court has said it  will not hear NWAC's oase until BCNWS'  case is heard.

DEC/JAN 2000 Newts  Biopiracy: colonialism in the new millennium  The final frontier  by Jeannette Armstrong  "Indigenous peoples are facing a new  wave of colonization, this time at the molecular level. Worldwide efforts such as the  Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP),  and numerous independent research  projects, are interested in collecting human  DNA samples from Indigenous peoples.  Since Indigenous populations represent a  significant percentage of the world's human diversity, we are also priority subjects  for scientific curiosity."  - from the Indigenous Peoples  Coalition Against Biopiracy website  On the last weekend in October, representatives of 14 Indigenous peoples'organizations from North, Central and South America  gathered together in Los Angeles. Their mission: to organize an Indigenous Peoples Summit to critically address trade practices and  other related issues, like the HGDP. The outcome: a summit will be held in October 2000  in Mexico.  Jeannette Armstrong was one of the participants at the LA meeting. As well as being a  writer and teacher, she has long been an activist in the struggle to safeguard the biological  resources of Indigenous peoples.  Armstrong is from the Okanagan Nation.  She currently works as a professor of Creative  Writing at the University of Victoria through  the En'owkin Centre in Penticton, BC, and is  a teacher of Okanagan language and culture.  She is also putting the final touches on her new  novel, Whispering in Shadows.  The following is excerpted and edited from  a speech Armstrong gave as part of The Pomelo  Project held at the Mcintosh Gallery in Vancouver in June 1996.  The Human Genome Diversity Project  (HGDP) is a project concerned with collecting the genetic materials of Indigenous peoples who are "endangered." The rationale  is to do this before the endangered peoples  became "extinct"—before they disappear,  in other words.  The HGDP is part of the larger Human  Genome Project, which is intended to map  the entire human genome (genetic coding).  Both projects are being pushed forward by  the scientific community and various governments, such as the United States,  Canada and several European countries.  The focus of the HGDP are 722 endangered Indigenous communities around the  world. It involves going into these communities and collecting DNA samples—from  at least 25 persons per community. Those  samples would then be put in a repository  (a DNA databank).  The goal of the HGDP is to look at how  the genetic make-up of different Indigenous  populations diverge, in order to assess  whether their genes have any useful scientific or medical applications.  That's the general mandate of the  HGDP. It doesn't seem to be anything to be  alarmed about... until we start looking at  some of the agendas behind this project.  Why would anyone want to collect  DNA samples of endangered peoples and  put it in a repository? Why would anyone  make the samples available? And to whom  are they making these samples available?  To that last question, the answer is: science. From there, you have to ask, who  owns science? The answer is: transnational  corporations.  Science isn't developed in the medical  community to help people; science is developed to make profits. And clearly, it's  not developed to help Indigenous peoples.  If you look worldwide, Indigenous  peoples have the statistics to bear that out:  the highest rates of many diseases, the  worst access to medical services, the highest rates of poverty, and so on.  So who benefits from this kind of science? It's the people who can afford the  fancy genetic things that are going to be  made available [from the HGDP-gathered  samples.]  It's really hard to get information out  [about the HGDP] to Indigenous communities here in Canada. I can't just take a leaflet to distribute; no one's going to read it.  The average literacy level is about Grade 3  or 4, even though Canada is among the top  ten countries in terms of literacy.  Trying to develop tools to inform my  people about this kind of project and what  it might mean to us is difficult. I have to  talk about a science which is totally foreign  to Indigenous peoples' way of thinking.  And, then, I need to talk about things like  patent laws.  I try to explain that the [collection of  DNA, patenting] can all be done, and is  being done. It is critical to put it to people  in a way which makes clear how such practices jeopardize their principles, their human rights, and their rights as Indigenous  peoples.  Educating around these issues is even  more difficult in countries where there's an  even lower level of literacy, and where most  Indigenous people live in rural and remote  communities, such as in the jungles or the  mountains.  Question: How do you ensure Indigenous people understand the impact of  projects such as the HGDP on their lives,  livelihoods and future generations? Proponents of the HGDP have the audacity to say  they've formed an ethics committee and are  designing a process by which to get "informed" consent from Indigenous peoples,  before the collection of DNA takes place  and before pharmaceutical companies  come in to get them to sign contracts.  Our response: How can you develop a  process by which you inform a completely  different culture of people who don't even  subscribe to your Western ideals of science,  who don't believe in the commodification  of land, rights, let alone the  commodification of the basic structure of  life?  It is important for us, as Indigenous  peoples, to talk about these issues. In 1995,  Indigenous leaders representing more than  30 Indigenous peoples' organizations from  South, Central and North America came  together in Phoenix, Arizona. There, we did  a workshop on all the issues related to the  HGDP.  One thing that was central to our discussions was the realization that it's not just  about intellectual property rights, or the  patenting of life forms, genes and other  species; it's about the ownership of land  and water and, ultimately, the ownership  of a people.  When you allow the ownership of a  people, it's not a far stretch to extend it to  the ownership of the individual genes of a  people. That's the view from which Indigenous leaders approach the HGDP.  Colonization in this hemisphere has  been going on for over 500 years. At the  United Nations and in other world organizations, the so-called nation-states sit together to design trade apparatuses to facilitate this kind of biopiracy (or bio-colonialism). Then, they sit together and design  ways to legalize that kind of piracy.  It is a piracy which says you can own  a people and reap the benefits of thousands  from years of their caretakership. It is a piracy which deprives the same people of the  right to say, "No, you're not going to kill  these rivers, these species; you're not going to make us extinct. You don't have that  right. We have the right to protect this land  for thousands of generations to come."  When I ask Indigenous peoples if they  feel there is any hope of protecting our  rights and our genes under these UN-sanctioned trade regimes, they say, "No." And  that's for one simple reason: not one Indigenous nation from North, Central or South  America is sitting at that table as a nation.  It's not about population base. There  are about 20 million Mayan people spread  throughout seven nation-states in Central  and South America. Twenty million people who have a land base, who have a culture, who have a language, who had political systems, who had sciences... but they  do not have one seat, one voice in the  United Nations.  It's been really difficult for Indigenous  people to get across that we do not have  the same mindset [as the proponents of the  HGDP] Part of our laws—here in BC, the  Northwest Territories, Six Nations, Central  America, and so on—involves respecting  and sharing with all other things living on  the land.  Sharing doesn't mean ownership; sharing means taking the responsibility to look  after—transgenerationally and in a healthy  way—the life forms that sustain your life,  your children's lives, your grandchildren's  lives, and that sustained your ancestors'  lives.  I work at an international level trying  to get wording into international agreements that protects and enhances the rights  of Indigenous peoples. I see the importance  of that work, but I do see it as a stopgap  measure only. It addresses the symptoms  of the problem, not the problem itself.  The fundamental problem is the notion  that life forms—defined in a broad sense—  can be commodified.  We all know it's not right to  commodity the water, the air, the land, our  own flesh or the flesh of the living things  around us. Still, we get caught up in these  trade apparatuses that have been framed  and shaped over the past few hundred  years—apparatuses driven by a profit motive which benefits a small number of people to the detriment of most of the world's  population.  Every single thing that lives and  breathes beside us, feeds our bodies. With  out those things, we don't have life. Without protection of those things, we don't  have any assurances that there will be a next  generation.  To support this profit-based system,  people need to be oppressed. This system  requires everything to be commodifiable.  It requires access to resources that are unavailable because Indigenous peoples are  standing in the way. It requires the threat  and reality of poverty in order to make people into consumers, in a way that is against  our own survival.  We do not have basic human rights  when our lives are at threat because of all  that has been done to our food, air, water...  Every one of us is under threat. Every one  of us knows someone who has died of cancer or who has a disease related to toxicities  invading our bodies. Isn't life a human  right? Isn't living healthy a human right?  The HGDP is just the tip of the iceberg.  If Indigenous peoples' genes can be made  available to scientists and pharmaceutical  companies for research and profit, then  everyone else's genes can be too.  It's difficult to maintain hope, but we  must do better than this as human beings.

New restorative  justice project  underway  In a coalition project on "restorative  justice," the Aboriginal Women's Action  Network is working with Aboriginal  women who are employed by non-Native  anti-violence agencies in Vancouver. Restorative justice is an alternative to going  through the mainstream justice system.  The advisory committee for the project  is composed of representatives from Battered Women's Support Services, Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter,  WAVAW (Women Against Violence Against  Women Rape Crisis Centre), the Breaking  the Silence Project, and some members of  AWAN.  Our objective is to explore the implications of restorative justice programs that  are being developed and implemented in  Aboriginal communities. The impetus for  our taking on this project came from our  participation in the Vancouver Aboriginal  Restorative Justice Caucus.  As members of that committee, we  found ourselves continually torn between  loyalties to our nationhood and sovereignty  struggle, and our defence of our human  rights as Aboriginal women.  The process has begun with advisory  committee members educating themselves  on what all of this means. Following these  study sessions, we will begin developing  12 workshops for Aboriginal women in the  community.  Details to be worked out include identifying resource people to make presentations for each topic area, developing accreditation and promotion for enrollment.  We are hoping that participants will include  Aboriginal women who are front-line service providers, as well as women who are  working through a healing process.  Upon completion of the study sessions  and the workshops, AWAN will document  our findings into a final report. We have  obtained funding from a cross-cultural  grant from the City of Vancouver and will  attempt to access further funding from  other sources in the coming months.  -Fay Blaney (AWAN)  For more information about the Aboriginal Women's Action Network's' Restorative  Justice Project, contact AWAN, c/o 309-877 E.

Mentoring First  Nations girls  In response to requests of First Nations  "Little Sisters" to have role models of similar cultural background, the First Nations-  Big Sister Mentoring Program was initiated.  The program is intended to address social  issues surrounding the high proportion of  First Nations youth in BC's Lower Mainland.  Over 50 percent of First Nations people living in the Lower Mainland and con  sistently throughout the province are under the age of 25. With such a high proportion of youth in our communities, it is necessary to encourage the adult generations  to take a role in guiding our children.  The goal of matching First Nations Big  Sisters with First Nations Little Sisters from  similar cultural backgrounds is to encourage the transmission of traditional values  between generations of women and girls.  This program has existed within Big  Sisters of BC Lower Mainland for just over  a year now. We have successfully matched  three First Nations women with First Nations little sisters. Currently, less than one  percent of our Big Sisters are First Nations  ancestry, while 20 percent of our Little Sisters are First Nations. The average amount  of time a girl waits to be matched with any  Big Sister after being referred to our agency  is one year.  The mentoring program was developed to address any program and policy  barriers that may exist within Big Sisters  that deter First Nations women from signing up. We designed it to reflect the circumstances unique to urban First Nations.  With more than 10,000 First Nations  youth in Canada living in some phase of  foster care (usually in a non-First Nations  home), we are faced with an even greater  need for adults to take a role in guiding girls  of First Nations ancestry. To enrich the lives  of our future life-givers and caretakers of  the culture is an investment worth making.  - Alanaise Ferguson  If you are interested in participating in or  hearing more about the First Nations Big Sister Mentoring Program, please contact  Alanaise Ferguson at (604) 873-4525, ext. 309.

As reported in earlier  issues of Kinesis, our research questions  were formulated by Aboriginal women  from communities throughout the province. These same women were the ones  who identified women from their own  communities to interview.  Upon completion of our final report,  AWAN members were not satisfied with  releasing it, until we conducted another  phase of consultation with a variety of  women, who were asked to review it. Input and last minute additions were integrated into the report.  With the "Bill C-31 Final Report" now  in print, the Aboriginal Women's Action  Network will now be shifting our focus to  the implementation of our recommendations. The attention generated from this  project sharply defined the issue of inadequacy of advocacy and educational services to Aboriginal women on Bill C-31.  Project objectives included surveying  the experiences of Aboriginal women and  analyzing policy with regard to this legislation. However, what we were frequently  called upon to do was provide advocacy  or educational services. The difficulty that  women encountered with reinstatement  procedures was often mired with confusion, costly documentation and arbitrary  decision making at the level of the "Registrar Entitlement Unit [of the DIA]."  Within this isolating process, the registrar and its bureaucracy does nothing to  coordinate or cross-reference members of  the same family who are engaged in the  same application procedures. If the registrar denies reinstatement of an applicant,  the very same registrar is the one who must  hear the appeal. Now, how many registrars  would be willing to admit that they made  a mistake the first time around and be willing to reverse that decision?  In short, Aboriginal women are subjected to rigorous and rigid guidelines in  applying for reinstatement. This is a situation in which all power and authority rests  with the registrar. It is a process which  women must go through alone.  Applying for reinstatement of status is  usually just the beginning of a long struggle to regain inherent Aboriginal rights. Trying to access rights and benefits that 'status Indians' are entitled to can be difficult  enough, particularly with the competition  over scarce resources in Aboriginal communities.  In these conflicts, newly reinstated  women are vulnerable both as 'outsiders'  and because they are outside the decisionmaking process. Band councils control the  allocation of such limited resources as  housing, educational funding, health and  other benefits. The primary issue is the lack  of advocacy and educational services for  Aboriginal women, at both the reinstatement stage and for post-reinstatement follow-up.  Accessing "Existing Aboriginal  Rights" under section 35 of the constitution  is a challenge for reinstated women. The  devolution of powers under the guise of  self-government also compounds the problems of unequal power relations. For example, the passage of Bill C-49 has increased the powers of band councils by giving them absolute authority over reserve  lands.  Despite the lobbying efforts of the  Native Women's Association of Canada,  nothing was done to address "Matrimonial  Property Rights" of Aboriginal women on-  reserve in this legislation. The dangers for  marginalized people on-reserve, particularly newly reinstated, are obvious. Band  councils have the legal right to evict any-  Advisory committee for Bill C-31 project  L-R: Fay Blaney, Lizabeth Hall, Audrey Huntley, Rain Daniels, Jennifer Dysart.  one from reserves if they see better opportunities for that land.  In parallel course with globalization  measures, such as the MAI, NAFTA and  other trade agreements, band councils are  moving toward putting corporate interests  before human rights. At an economic and  political level, Aboriginal women need a  voice, an opportunity to participate in decisions that affect our lives.  Aboriginal communities are coming to  the realization that all of us, who have status, are categorized under some section of  Bill C-31. Whether we allow the Department of Indian Affairs to deplete our  populations, or if we actively participate  in that 'termination' through narrowly defined membership codes, the results are the  same. The court cases that we heard about  in the course of our research indicate that  some band councils are playing an active  role in that termination policy by developing and implementing membership codes  which reflect the internalized racism of our  communities and biological conceptions of  identity which are highly constrained.  Other cases before the courts are in relation to section 6(2), the second generation  cut-off rule. Our report demands that this  section of Bill C-31 be struck! Further, we  demand that the requirement of single  mothers for proof of paternity be struck!  We call upon our non-Aboriginal allies to  support us in our lobby of the minister of  Indian Affairs, Robert Nault, to strike these  things from Bill C-31.  Thanks to the hard work of the Bill C-31  advisory committee members, especially our researcher, Audrey Huntley, (who is also the  guest editor of this issue o/Kinesis.)  Fay Blaney is Homalco.

She currently is an instructor in Women's  Studies and Canadian Studies at Langara College and in Women's Studies at the University  of British Columbia.  Excerpt! Hot off the Press! Chapter II of AWAN's Final Report:  Bill C-31: Its Impact, Implications and Recommendations for Change in British Columbia -  Approaches to Research  by Audrey Huntley  Throughout the course of colonization,  Native peoples have endured the scrutinizing gaze of many researchers, anthropologists, sociologists and political scientists.  Being the objects of these studies, having  no control as to their direction or goals, Native people rarely benefit or even learn  about the conclusions that are drawn from  their experiences.  It is understandable that scepticism  and even contempt for "the researcher,"  have ensued. Native people have become  increasingly selective in who they choose  to divulge any more information about  their lives to. More and more often, we as  Native people are taking on the role of researchers and examining the various circumstances that shape our lives from  within the community, informed by an Indigenous perspective.  The Aboriginal Women's Action Network's undertaking, to identify and examine some of the problems encountered by  Native women with regards to the 1985 [Bill  C-31] legislation, involved asking the  women to speak of very sensitive and extremely painful issues. This called for a high  degree of trust between interviewer and  interviewee, which was established on the  basis of a common lived experience.  Not only were the interviewers Native  women affected by Bill C-31, they also came  from or were a part of the communities of  the women interviewed. We are convinced  that the information contained in our report titled Bill C-31: Its Impact, Implications  and Recommendations for Change in British  Columbia could not have been obtained any  other way.  In carrying out this exploratory research, we chose to utilize a research strategy and methodology rooted in the concepts of feminist empowerment and community-based participatory action. Since  the effects of colonization are mediated by  gender, Native women have concerns  which are specific to us and must be addressed in recognition of the imbalance of  power inherent in a patriarchal society.  AWAN conceived of this project in the  context of our goal to develop our own  brand of feminism, to reclaim women-centred histories and to increase Native wom  en's political representation. At the same  time, AWAN is committed to the empowerment of the Native community as a whole  and believes that enabling Native women  to take control of our lives can only benefit  overall efforts at decolonization.  It was the experience of exclusion, of  being silenced and rendered invisible that  prompted Native women to form our own  groups and defend our interests on a political level. In AWAN's work, we have  been acutely aware of this ongoing reality  of marginalization. Our members saw this  project as a prime opportunity to let those  voices, which are normally silenced by the  dominant discourse, be heard.  The completion of a tangible product—  our report—is only one measure of our success. Throughout the course of our research,  we were concerned with initiating and sustaining a collective process which would  allow all the participants in the project the  highest degree of participation and input  possible.  We agree with Janice Ristock and Joan  Pennell, who say, "that research itself can  be a lived process of empowerment when  it encompasses both a critical analysis of  power and a reconstructing of power so  that the latter can be used in a responsible  manner."  According to French theorist Michel  Foucault: "power circulates and thus is  never localized at one particular moment.  Power is exercised through a network of  individuals, yet is never in anyone's  hands." While we recognize that power is  sedimented in institutions such as the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern  Development, we see the power relations  in any social context as in flux, not fixed  but rather as a dynamic between the different actors involved. We are not only victims of the structural imbalance of power  and the individuals that wield it, but also  agents of change. For this reason, our study  examines not only what the Indian Act does  to us and our communities, but also how  we respond to and participate in the construction of our realities.  It is not sufficient in a participatory  action-oriented research project (PAR) to ac-  cumulate knowledge for the sake of  academia. Rather, the goal is to assist in the  see BILL C-31 next page  DEC/JAN 2000  SIS from BILL C-31 previous page  struggle for social change. Patricia Maguire  describes PAR as consisting of "three main  components: investigation, education and  action." This effectively describes the different stages of this project. This was to be  research which would effect change and directly influence the lives of those it touched.  After an initital planning stage, we  held a conference to  consult with the  community. Native  women affected by  Bill C-31 came together from across  British Columbia to  share their experiences and develop  our research questions. These women,  as well as others  who were identified  later, then went into  the communities  and began the interview process.  Insufficient resources and budgetary constraints were  factors throughout  the entire project.  Money for paid  work was limited to  a part-time coordinator position, a researcher's salary and a  small honorarium for the interviewers.  Tasks such as transcribing the interviews  were done by volunteers. Additional gaps  were filled by numerous fundraising efforts.  Although the lack of continuous funding forces AWAN to carry out our work  largely on an unpaid basis, we were extremely uncomfortable with our inability  to remunerate the interviewees. They provided the substance out of which our "findings" developed, and they did so at some  risk. While financial constraints tested our  resourcefulness and creativity, these were  not the only concerns which arose during  the interview process. Many interviewers  reported encountering a strong interest in  our work and a willingness to tell their stories. Some women did not wish to be taped,  or expressed fear of exposure and repercussions from within their communities.  In most cases, the interviews required  a great deal of preparatory work, often several meetings, before the women were at  ease. The women in these communities—  interviewers and interviewees alike—  struggle everyday with the reality of ongoing genocide, disintegration of family and  community, violence and poverty.  The havoc that colonization wreaks in  Native women's lives is not easily put on  hold, no matter how important the project.  Our researcher and project coordinator who  spent much time on the phone liaising with  the interviewers heard many examples of  the challenges they faced. Often, although  women agreed to be interviewed, they had  difficulties finding the time for the interview.  In a letter, one interviewer explained  why she could not complete all of the interviews she had planned.  "Please forgive me for not completing  the project, but my heart was in the right  place. The other two interviewees had  health problems and a suicide in their family, so they weren't able to complete the interview. The devastation of living on-reserve is so bad, dysfunctional, unhealthy  and helpless that I don't know how much  longer I will last."  At the same time, the interview process showed us that the telling of these worn-  The interviews  were emotional  and often  disturbing, yet  clearly a  powerful  experience of  reclaiming  a sense of self  en's stories was of immediate benefit to  them. One interviewer put it this way:  "...when I interviewed these individuals,  they felt that finally someone was listening  to them. It's a step closer to healing themselves."  The interviews were emotional and  often disturbing, yet clearly a powerful experience of reclaiming a sense of self. One  of the women interviewed spoke of having been raped as a  child. The interviewer was the first  person she had ever  told. She was 77  years old at the time  of the interview.  The interviewers also expressed  benefitting from the  experience. As one  woman put it:  "Both interviewer  and interviewee  learned from each  other." Reciprocity  is in fact a tenet of  feminist research  where: "questions  flow both ways.  Narrators have the  opportunity to interrogate interviewers about the research project and  about the interviewer herself."  Once the interviewers had completed  their interviews, they were asked to fill out  an evaluation form. Questions pertaining  to their participation in the conference, their  relationship to AWAN and the project coordinator/researcher were included with  the intent of examining our success in carrying out a participatory action model.  Interviewers were asked to provide  impressions of the interviews and formulate recommendations for change. Despite  physical distance the interviewers were, in  this way, able to continue contributing to  the analysis of our findings.  As our funding resources became depleted, the focus of the thematic analysis  narrowed. The interview questions addressed a broad range of issues related to  identity, community, governance and future  generations. Necessity dictated that for the  purpose of this report, we focus on the effects on the individual pertaining to the reinstatement process, access to rights and  benefits, and the personal experience of the  interviewees and their families in their interactions with their communities of origin.  Themes were emerging in all of the  above categories. Further funding is  needed to do justice to the wealth of information the interviewees have given so  freely. In particular, the issue of self-government and women's fears of exclusion  due to the nepotism and favouritism practised by many band councils must not be  erased.  The band council system was imposed  on First Peoples in accordance with divide-  and-rule tactics. Along with excluding  women from positions of power and creating a lack of transparency in the governance of community affairs, it has worked  to create a corrupted class of Native elites  who further the needs of the colonizer.  The interviews were conducted utilizing a semi-structured narrative form. We  chose a simple referencing system, referring  to the women interviewed by interviewee  number, thus guaranteeing their anonymity. Although we contemplated the use of  pseudonyms, we decided not to attempt a  random selection of names. We believe that  names are always infused with (cultural)  meaning and did not wish to colour the  interviewees' voice in this way.  In total, 60 interviews were completed  between December 1998 and April 30,1999.  Of these interviews, 36—the first two we  receieved from each region—were chosen  to be included in the thematic analysis. It  should be noted that our researcher studied all the interviews; all of these voices  inform our analysis.  Our study reflects the inter-  generational impact of Bill C-31. We have  interviewed women who lost their status  when they married non-Native or non-status men as well as women who never had  status because their mothers had lost theirs.  The age range for the women interviewed  was as follows: 10 were between 25 and 40,  14 were between 41 and 50, and 12 women  were between 51 and 77.  The interviewees identified themselves  as: Algonquin, Beaver, Cree, Halfway River  (Dunneza), Carrier, Coldwater, Dene/  Doghrib, Gitxsan, Gitwangak (Gitxsan),  Gwiechen, Haisla, Homalco, Kitkatla  (Tsimshian), Kwaguilth, Lower Nicola  Band, Nuu-Chah-Nulth, Okanagan,  Saulteaux, Secwepemc, Similkameen, Six  Nations, Sliammon, Squamish, Tahltan,  Tsimshian, Tsilhquot'in, and Wet'suwet'en.  Nine women were born out of province;  their presence in Indigenous communities  in BC is a reflection of the mobility of the  Native community and its inter-national  character.  Interviews were carried out in Bella  Coola, Campbell River, Castlegar,  Chetwyn, Comox, Enderby, Hazelton,  Kamloops, Kitimat, Merritt, Penticton,  izing around identity which sparked the  most enthusiastic and sometimes heated  debate. The interview question: "Aside  from the Indian Act who is Indian in your  opinion?" generated lengthy responses by  the women interviewed.  Often, they came back to the subject  several times throughout the course of an  interview. We were able to gain much insight from their perspectives and subsequently testing the theory on these women's words, we attempted to examine its  relevance for our political organizing.  The Core Advisory Committee represented a microcosm of the communities we  were working with. A wide range of experience exists: some of the women working  on this project were born and raised on the  land; others have never set foot on the  homelands of their ancestors. Some of us  are in the process of learning our cultures  and traditions, while others are still trying  to adapt to living in non-Native society.  One of our members can speak her Indigenous language. In the Advisory Committee, we all engage in some form of academic work. With respect to age and experience, we represent a broad range. AWAN  members are not a homogenous group and  this is reflected in our individual social  positions and politics. However, we are all  committed to the struggle for social justice  and decolonization, including the return of  stolen Native land.  In particular, we object to the hierarchies in governmental structures that create disadvantages and emotional hardships  for Native women that we too often blame  ourselves for. An appreciation of diversity  An appreciation of diversity and our  struggle for consensus have made  our process unique and exceptional  Keremeos, Powell River, Prince George,  Prince Rupert, Smithers, Williams Lake and  the urban centres of Vancouver and Victoria. Further interviewers were active in  Chilliwack, Lytton, Masset, Port Hardy,  Quesnel, Sechelt, Skidegate and Squamish.  However, these interviewers were not able  to complete the process.  While the stories were being told across  the province, AWAN members in Vancouver engaged in a discussion process aimed  at developing an analysis of the status quo  with regards to Bill C-31 and the Indian Act.  Moreover, AWAN addresses broader issues  related to our political work towards  decolonization and as feminists.  A study group was formed and with  the help of practicum students, we began  to surf the web in search of publications on  the legislation, Indigenous women and the  state, as well as related theory. We accessed  articles from the mainstream and Native  press, government publications as well as  academic findings.  Informed by a feminist approach to  knowledge which is integrative,  transdisciplinary and would "Ground  theory contextually in the concrete realm  of women's everyday lives,"we sought  texts addressing the various ways that the  Indian Act affected women's lives and our  work. We looked at Masters and Doctoral  theses on or directly related to Bill C-31 and  the Indian Act. We grappled with the legal  jargon of case commentaries in law journals and delved into the toolbox of  postmodern theory.  While most of the writings we elected  to discuss were intriguing, it was the subject of "identity," and the politics of organ-  and our struggle for consensus have made  our process unique and exceptional.  A high point in our collective process  was experienced when the members of our  Core Advisory Committee travelled to Edmonton to attend the 2nd National Conference on Bill C-31 organized by the Native  Women's Association of Canada (NWAC).  We were able to present our preliminary  findings to the plenary session as well as  facilitate a workshop.  In four days of plenary sessions, workshops and meetings "on the side," we encountered Native women from organizations across Canada who spoke of the problems faced by the women in their communities. These were mirrored in the interviews we had conducted in BC. It became  apparent that similiar research was badly  needed across the country and that this  would be best done by the organizations  representing Native women's interests in  their respective regions.

As people, we need these stories, they show us the way they  inspire us, they feed us.J  - Christine Welsh -  by Andrea Walsh  tine  a Regina born Metis woman,  has been a filmmaker and writer  for the last 25 years. I came across  her film, Women in the Shadows  (1992), a one-hour documentary  about Christine's search for her  Metis foremothers in 1995 while  at the University of Victoria library  one day.  As I watched and listened to  Christine narrate the stories of the  Aboriginal women in her family-  women, who, through country  ' marriages, became entwined in  the history of the fur-trade in  Western Canada-I could not help  but think of my own questions  about my great-great-grandmother, Mary Hunter, a  Nlaka'pamux mixed-blood woman,  born from a country marriage at  the time of the Gold Rush in British Columbia.  It made me reflect on the roles  of our Aboriginal foremothers and  their lives during those times of  colonial expansion. That day when  I watched Women in the Shadows,  Christine's personal journey profoundly moved me, and in some  way strengthened my own identity  and respect for the women in my  own family.  Women in the Shadows affected many more people than just  myself. Written and produced by  Christine Welsh and directed by  Norma Bailey, the film was named  Best Documentary at the 1992  Vancouver International Film Festival and was nominated for the  1993 Academy of Canadian Cin-  Andrea Walsh: Can you talk about your  inspiration for the film Keepers of the Fire?  Christine Welsh: I had been thinking  about Keepers of the Fire for probably five  years before I made it. That film was essentially my honour song for the women  ema and Television Gemini award  for Best Documentary.  Other films by Christine Welsh  include Keepers of the Fire (1994),  a filmic tribute to First Nations  women's resistance and Kuper Island: Return to the Healing Circle  (1997), the story of the survivors  of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School which she co-directed and co-produced with Peter Campbell.  Christine's films have been  broadcast widely and featured at  festivals across Canada and in the  United States including the Native  American Film and Video Festival  in New York, the American Indian  Film Festival in San Francisco, the  Native American Film and Video  Exposition in Santa Fe and the  Vancouver International Film Festival.  Christine presently divides her  time between SaltSpring Island  and Victoria, BC where she teaches  courses on First Nations women  and Indigenous cinema in the  Women Studies Department of the  Univesiry of Victoria. Her production company, Prairie Girl Films,  is currently producing a documentary about the Coast Salish  woolworkers of southern Vancouver Island and developing a film  on Two-Spirit women.  Three years after I first  watched Women in the Shadows, I  have come to know Christine  through her warm sense of humour, compassion, and humility.  What follows are excerpts from a  conversation I had with Christine  in the late fall of 1999...  who had really inspired me as I was coming of age as an adult Aborginal woman,  figuring out who I was and where I fit in  the continuum of Aboriginal experience. I  wanted to honour them and celebrate them  and in some way share what they had to  teach. I thought it was really, really important to make a film that would show young  Aboriginal women what their grandmothers, mothers, aunts and sisters had done,  the extraordinary things that they had accomplished.  Andrea: How do you decide what stories to tell?  Christine: In that case I knew what stories I wanted to be in the film right from  the beginning. The stories that I thought  were important in terms of presenting the  struggles that Aboriginal women have been  involved in—for example, the struggle for  land, the struggle for sovereignty, the struggle for personal safety, the struggle for political rights.  Not all of the stories in that film were  about women with whom I had previous  contact, with the exception of Anduhyaun  (the Toronto Native women's shelter)  where I had worked. I just approached  them (the Mohawk women of Kanehsatake  and Kahnawake, the Haida women who  had helped stop logging on Lyell Island,  the Maliseet women of Tobique, New  Brunswick, and the women of Anduhyaun)  very candidly with my previous film under my arm and said, "This is who I am,  this is where I come from, this is the kind  of film I make, and this is my idea—that  Aboriginal women are warriors. What do  you think? Do you see yourselves as warriors?" And that's where I started. And in  every case, the women themselves were involved in deciding how we were going to  do this, how we were going to tell their stories.  I don't think you can make a film if  you don't have a passion for that story.  Making a film is such an incredibly  grueling process that if you don't have that  passion for the story you won't finish it,  you won't get there. Most of the films I  make are about women because that's my  My passion is to tell our stories because I think Aboriginal women, in both  their public and their private lives, do so  many extraordinary things that get recognized only within a very small sphere. As  people, we need those stories, they feed us,  they show us the way, they inspire us.  In the case of the film I'm working on  right now, the story of the Cowichan knitters, it's the story of generations of women  here on Vancouver Island who have held  their families and communities together by  knitting. We need to be able to hear these  women's stories and realize this is how  they've helped us survive, this is the legacy  they've given us.  There is a man in the film who talks  about what his mother gave him. He sat  up at night with his mother knitting when  he was a kid and he talks about his memories. They would sit up all night and he  would knit the sleeves and she would knit  the bodies and then they would go sell. And  he says, "I'm really grateful for what my  mother has given me because she taught  us to work together, the value of working  together."  So things like these sweaters give us  more than money. I think that is a really  important thing to be considering these  days because money seems to drive so  much of what we consider to be of value.  Andrea: The film Kuper Island: Return  to the Healing Circle is about the terrible  emotional legacy of a residential school in  Coast Salish territory. How were you affected and transformed as a result of the  difficult nature of this film?  Christine: I think every film teaches me  something and it's often through the people that you meet. The people I've met in  the process of making films have transformed my life. I really believe in some  ways that the films I've made have come  along at times in my life when I needed  them as much as the story needed to be told  or was there to be told. It was something  that I needed to learn too.  Now, we hear so much about residential schools, but when we started work on  that film it was only beginning to be discussed openly. The former students of the  Kuper Island Residential School who participated in that film were very, very brave.  There was a lot of pressure for them  not to speak, a lot of pressure for this story  not to be brought out into the public because of what it would unleash, because of  the pain and suffering that were tied up in  that experience.  Once they had begun to tell their story,  I just felt an enormous sense of responsibility. I felt they had pulled me into a bargain,  they'd said, "OK, we've told you all this  now, we've put all this out there, we've let  you film it, and we've done it because we  want it to go further, this story has got to  go further than here. Because that's the only  way that change will happen." And as it  turns out, some of the people that appeared  in the film are now taking legal action  against the Roman Catholic Church.  I really do think that when you make  films with people, they're giving you an  incredible gift. They give you this gift—  their stories—and you're meant to do something with it in the best way that you can.  All that you can do, is carry that with as  much care and respect as you can. In the  case of Kuper Island I was very, very conscious that this was not my story.  I don't claim that because I'm Metis I  have any kind of essential right to represent or tell Aboriginal stories. I don't think  simply being Aboriginal gives you that  right. I've never been to a residential school.  No one in my family ever went to a residential school. It was not part of our experience. And yet here I was living in this territory with Coast Salish people and they'd  given me this story to tell, because they recognized that I had a skill that could help  them get their story told. It was an extraordinary gift, and a huge responsibility.  seeWELSHpage12 Understanding the impact of the Indian Act:  time to connect  a conversation between Lizabeth Hall and Sandra Gray  For over a century, assimilationist policies have wrought havoc on the lives of the  Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island. As a  genocidal tool, the Indian Act has been responsible for the displacement of thousands of our people and the source of much  pain and suffering. It has served to separate and divide us. Families have been broken apart, loss of culture and language has  ensued.  Lizabeth Hall has been a front-line  worker for the United Native Nations in  the Family Reunification Program for the  past 10 years. She has had the opportunity  to hear countless stories of people searching for their families, looking for their  homes. In many cases, she has been successful in helping people reconnect.  Sandra Gray is an activist who participated in the Aboriginal Women's Action  Network's Bill C-31 project as a interviewer  Katie Gray (age 10) introduces Sandra:  My mom is Tsimshian, she dances. She has  three sisters, two brothers. She works for a  parent support circle. She, and everyone  else in our family, does something that is a  part of our culture.  Sandra: I would like to acknowledge  the Coast Salish peoples, on whose land we  are conducting this interview. Thank you  very much Liz for having this conversation.  Could you please tell me a bit about yourself first?  Lizabeth: I'm originally from Bella  Coola, which is 365 air miles north of Vancouver. The name of our nation is the  Nuxalk Nation. Nuxalk is the name of the  land where we currently reside. We don't  have a specific name for our Nation, simply because we were many different people at one time. We were many different  individual families.  Talking about family and who I am is  a continuum of information which begins  with our creation story. This defines who  Bella Coola people are. I had a really beautiful grandmother; her name was Mabel  Hall. She taught us that every family has  their own creation story. Mine is really long.  I think it is important to know it. It shaped  who I became and why I do the things I do  today.  This is a short version: our first ancestor was one of many human beings that  Alqntaem, the creator/god, gave a choice  of cloaks to. They donned one cloak and  then floated down to the place where they  lived. They took the cloak off and proceeded to live their lives as human beings.  Alqntaem is one of four levels of existence:  where Alqntaem lives; where supernatural  human beings live; where human beings  live when they die; and then of course our  level of existence. When I die, on the fourth  day, I will travel back and along the way I  will see all my ancestors until I get to my  first ancestor. I will don the cloak that she  wore when she came to the place where  people live when they die.  My grandmother imparted many beliefs and values to me. I grew up in a kind  of war zone. Like so many others, our community is riddled with alcoholism, poverty,  abuse, violence, yet I never questioned  whether we would survive. I never questioned that because of my grandmother's  eternal faith in humanity, and living, loving and caring for her people. She did a lot  to build our family.  Sandra: It sounds like your grandmother helped to bring out a lot of strength  in you and she nourished you and provided  direction.  Lizabeth: Yes, she did. She was the  core, she was the centre, and because of her  I was able to have everybody else in my  life. I had my aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, sisters. She told me story after story so  that all the people in her memory became  alive in my mind. People whom I had never  known in their lifetime added something  to my life because my grandmother told me  about them. She said that everything happens for a reason. I see her as the reason  I'm well today, the reason I survived. I live  a happy life in comparison to a lot of people my age and it was because of her. It  enabled me to contribute in some way to  people in my family, to their wellness and  to their health and in getting over their  hurdles.  Sandra: Just to take it back to before  colonization, what was the structure within  the Nuxalk Nation for education, the family and the sharing of knowledge?  Lizabeth: Knowledge, education and  family all interact together everyday in the  way you live, the way you think, and the  role you play in the community. If you're a  child, if you are a man, if you are hereditary, if you are from a family of carvers,  those things shape the way you acquire  knowledge.  I've met some old people who are really fun. We had to ask them questions, and  in our culture that is kind of a rude thing to  do. Usually, you wait for what people offer  you. But in our generation, we just have to  ask because we really need to know.  Old people would look at me and say,  "Why are you asking?" or they just looked  at me and shook their heads. There was always a tension between cultures. The values and beliefs were always in tension.  One of the things my grandmother carried forward was that it's no use complaining; you learn as much as you can about  those tensions and you work with that. If  you resist, you will lose energy and  strength. Focus on what is good. I think  that's why we are here today; that's why  we have people whose language and culture are more visible.  My grandmother was not unique; there  were many people like her. I got to know  other people's families; other people's ancestors. It was educational growing up. I  knew that the public school system was  different, it had nothing to do with any  knowledge that was important to me. I became a good memorizer, a good student so  I didn't have to worry about school. I could  focus on other things.  Again, it's because of my grandmother  that I could do that. She shaped the way I  acquired knowledge and how I listen to  people. I don't know how many times I've  heard University of British Columbia, Social Work Professor, Richard Vedan remind  us of the teachings: to speak once and listen twice.  It sounds strange to hear that spoken  aloud because people never talked about  Sandra Gray (right) with her daughter Katie  such things; they just did them. But that's  the way it is, we have to talk about it now.  I know that I haven't imparted everything  that I want to onto my own sons. There's  work to be done in carrying my grandmother's knowledge forward.There's something  missing and that's because of the impact  of genocidal legislation like the Indian Act  on my generation.  Sandra: Knowing who you are within  your people, within your family, within  your clan, within your house, and within  your Nation is difficult. So much is gone  because a lot of information died with the  Elders...  Lizabeth: ...because their families are  gone. My grandmother was the one who  told me all about the rest of the family—  the people I didn't get to meet because they  died early deaths. I should have had these  people in my life. If I had, what would my  life have been? What is more important  than your family, whatever family you  have? Nothing is more important than that.  That's where everything grows from:  knowledge, education, values and beliefs,  what you do with yourself every day, what  your goals become, your interests. We're all  unique within that, but the centre is your  family.  Sandra: All of these resources are there  to help to raise the children and to help  them to grow up to be good people.  Lizabeth: They would have been a  natural influence in your children's lives.  They would have some role and responsibility towards them.  Sandra: We've lost a lot of our culture,  even in my own family. We work hard and  we try to do the best we can to live a good  life and try to remember even a few words  of wisdom that our grandmother would  say to us like, "look after one another, stay  together." Those are just six words, but  that's one of the main things I remember  about her, as well as her presence.  Sometimes it feels like there's not very  much there for us to work with. In our family, there's been a resurgence in acknowledging our Tsimshian heritage and trying  to find out more about who we are and how  we fit into our people so that we feel good  about ourselves. It's so important to feel  connected and know where you are from,  so you know where you're at and can plan  a little bit into the future, for the next generations.  Lizabeth: I think we are in the strange  position of trying to compare ourselves. We  don't need to do that because everywhere  I look when you feel connected, you are  really rich people. Colonialism has taken  away from that connection to family and  community and to the spirit of the ancestors. I like getting to know people. I feel  connected to people even though I don't  know them because they are Indigenous  folks and because I can see that strength  that's alive.  I am not surprised to find it in a city,  from people who are scattered all over and  who have a hard time connecting to each  other physically. I would see them and  know that they feel connected. There was  this sense of happiness, sense of belonging  and knowing who they are. Even though  they have to struggle for that technical information, they have an inner sense of who  they are, and they are reaching and searching for more.  I'm energized by the resurgence, the  eagerness to grasp information, all the  documentation and research that's going  on.  Sandra: When I'm down at West Coast  Family Night [Wednesday at the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre] and I see  so many young people, it amazes me. I'm  comparing it to my own generation and  what things were like. It's not the same.  Lizabeth: You can see the transformation of the people who go from walking  around on the sidewalk, to being dressed  in regalia dancing. Who's going to notice  that? We are. That's what we see. Non-Native people don't see that. It's from the  heart. That's what I mean about the  connectedness we have, even though sometimes we are kind of crazy to each other,  nation to nation. That's not just a little thing,  that's a lot.  Sandra: It's almost like going back to  pre-colonial times. It's a feeling of being a  part of a whole —it's big, it's huge.  see INDIAN ACT next page  from INDIAN ACT previous page  Lizabeth: When someone asks, "Who  are you?" Native people answer differently.  There's almost a secret code. A Native person will come along and ask, "Who are  you?" and I'll say actually my name is  Lizabeth Hall and I'm from Bella Coola, a  relative of blah, blah, blah. They go "Oh  yeah," and they want to know more.  That, to me, is like a comedy sketch because it demonstrates to me a natural tendency to be connected. You have to know  each other first. Certainly, I don't just tell  people my creation story because it's a very  unique situation. You can tell if people want  to know more.  Sandra: The Indian Act is a major  weapon used presently and in the past to  colonize Aboriginal people. As a First Nations woman, how have the different sections of the Indian Act affected your life?  Lizabeth: It trashed my life. I'll just tell  you one short story. My grampa was a  story-teller. He was a big grizzly bear guy.  He was a bush person, always out hunting, logging, fishing, everything.  He was the youngest in the family He  used to say, "We were poor alright." He  grew up in the longhouse with his dad, who  ' was a big chief. His dad would say, "I've  got holes in my gumboots, my house could  be filled from floor to ceiling in one day  with blankets, sugar, flour, shirts, dresses,  everything you could think of, you couldn't  move around. Then the next day it was all  gone, nothing, bare house, and I got holes  in my gumboots."  He'd laugh. He wasn't complaining; he  was just turning it into a big joke. It was  also really sad, because he was bearing  witness to the breaking apart of old  ways. It was the last  remnant of his family life. We were still  all living together.  Then we were  moved into separate  houses and onto the  reserves. We had the  Indian Agent telling  us how to live and  my grandmothers  and my aunties were  left without pride  and esteem.  It makes me really sad and angry; I  have a lot of emotions about it. It was good  for me to have gramma because she said,  "It's just the timing, being mad is not a bad  thing. It's good energy, put it to work." It  was important to take control of that anger, and that's what they did in spite of  everything that was happening to them.  They carried on and did what they could.  The Indian Act trashed generations before and after my granddad. In one swoop  the residential school took my language.  My mother went and was taught nothing.  The loss of love and connectedness she ex-  Lizabeth Hall at the Family Reunification Program's birthday party for  Aboriginal and Metis people who were adopted or fostered out.  In one swoop  the residential  school took  my language  perienced prevented her from ever  reacquiring her language in her life or being  able to teach us. It would have been better if  she had been the strength in our family, but  it was gone.  They tore our family apart, they tore our  community apart. Our community is separate and now we're fighting amongst each  other. There's alcoholism and there's poverty.  But 1999 encourages me. I see a lot of  young people and I can see it turning around.  I feel I'm part of something. There's still so  much despair that it's hard to keep focused  on what is turning around. I am not proud  of it, but there were times when I was in so  much despair that I abandoned my home. I  said forget it. I'm off to live on my own, away  from this place. I really made a decision to  do that. I was just tired, had no energy. All I  can remember was feeling powerless and  helpless, so I left.  The Indian Act was something that was  alive in our community, everything that it did  had an impact in one way or another. You  can pick any part of my life to focus on and I  could say something  about how the Indian  Act has affected it because it's so pervasive.  Some people say  the answer is to  throw it out and get  rid of it. I would be  the first to agree if we  could find something  to replace it. You  can't just throw it  out, you need to replace it with something. As bad as it is, it  could have been worse. It preserved some  land. It's not all of our land, it's the little that  we have left, but would we have it without  the Indian Act? At one time, it didn't provide enough protection, and reserve land  was sold by non-Native people who had acquired it through marriage. People were losing their land despite the Indian Act. So it  does not provide complete protection. People don't like to hear that because it's too  frightening.  Sandra: I didn't live under ihe Indian Act  because we didn't actually find out that we  were entitled to have status until about ten  years ago. One by one, we started to apply  for our status. That also meant,  inadvertantly, that we started doing research about our family. Even from negative things, there can be something positive. It initiated something.  Lizabeth: That's a good thing.  There's nobody who is Aboriginal in  Canada, and some in the States too, that  the Indian Act has left untouched. If you  didn't grow up in your ancestral community, it was likely due to that. If your  mother lost status, she would have been  immediately asked to leave. The Indian  Act separates families.  Sandra: The Indian Act even affected  our economy. When I look back on the  potlatch system, I see how different it was  from the capitalist system.  Lizabeth: It definitely messed up the  economy. My grandad was potlatching,  he was a chief and his house was full of  goods. The Indian Agent observed all of  this. It wasn't because he was selling it or  messing up someone else's economy, it  was because he was giving it away. The  agent thought that was incredible. Such  things exist now. I see it in other places  too; they call it the barter system. We've  got a different language, so we have different meanings, but it's the same concept.  Sandra: Could you tell me about the  work you do at the United Native Nations, as well as some of the other work  you are doing outside of the UNN that  you think is important as an Aboriginal  woman?  Lizabeth: One day, I decided that I  had to learn how to live with my people  because I really missed everybody. I  wanted to be a part of the community. I  was looking for a job when an opening at  the UNN, for a Bill C-31, legal assistant,  came up. My job was to help Sherry Clark,  now Sherry Small, a beautiful Nisga'a  woman. She was helping people research  their family trees in order to apply for status. This was in 1988.1 didn't know anything about Bill C-31 other than that it had  changed the Indian Act. I grew up on a  reserve with status and thought it  wouldn't affect me. I started reading and  to tell you the honest truth, I was astonished.  To help people apply for status I  needed to listen to their stories, to help  them build up family trees. I remember crying at some of the stories. I couldn't fathom  how it might feel to live in the city without  your community, away and separate.  I was also energized by it because these  people were really dynamic and willing to  share. For everything I did to help, they  gave me back tenfold. I was really enjoying myself. I spent the first while just listening. Then I met the first significant person who was adopted. We had previously  sent him down to Indian Affairs because  adoption records are sealed. How are you  supposed to apply for status if you don't  know your birth mom and dad's names? I  didn't know how to help him and began to  do research. We learned all about ihe Adoption Act and in a very short period of time,  about six weeks, he got his status. He was  happy as a lark. This experience really  made us angry. He had looked everywhere  for help, from people who were supposed  to help him, Indian Affairs and Social Services. We were angry that he had to go  through all of this, and that we had to go  through all of this. He had been searching  for his birth mother for the 10 years prior  to when he met us. In 1985 when Bill C-31  came around, he applied for his status. His  mom had been identified as an Indian in  his file. His goal wasn't to gain status, his  goal was to find his mother. He told us  about that and then he said, "can you  help?" In a very short period of time we  found his mom. That was 10 years ago and  we just kept on going from there. We started  looking in our files, we called other people  we thought we couldn't help before. I don't  know what we started, but it just ran away  from there and we've been doing it ever  since.  Sandra: This is the Reunification Program at the UNN?  Lizabeth: Yes, it grew out of the Bill C-  31 Program. What it is today came out of a  response to the clients' needs. We responded to a need and it just kept on growing in every different direction.  We realized that Aboriginal people  who are adopted have many, many different issues. Their problems are compounded  because of this experience. Ninety-nine percent of them are adopted into non-Native  homes and are raised in non-Native communities, and they are trying to connect to  people who were raised in Aboriginal communities. A lot of work needs to be done  and people need to have understanding  and sensitivity because you can't just find  people and connect them. In many cases  we find a birth mother who lost her child  through apprehension—99 per cent of the  children who were adopted were apprehended; they weren't put up for adoption.  A birth mother who lost her children may  not have talked about it for 25 to 30 years,  because when that file closed, a social  see INDIAN ACT next page  DEC/JAN 2000  DEC/JAN 2000 from INDIAN ACT previous page  worker probably told her that there's nothing she could ever do to find them. It's  closed. The file is sealed. It's another  weapon, just like the Indian Act.  People ask what the Family  Reunification Program does. We provide  services to adoption circle members. The  larger society refers to it as a triad, the adoptive parent, adoptee and birth parent. We  use the word "circle" because we believe  that if the adoptees are missing, it doesn't  just affect the parents, it affects the grandparents, the aunts, the uncles, brothers, sisters—the community. We get calls from all  those people. We provide services to  adoptees of all ages and to former children  in care.  A lot of children were taken away, not  legally adopted, but raised in care. They  have the same issues and have asked social workers for help in trying to find their  families. Some of them were consistently  denied information. It was their right to  have birth information but they were denied it. We have birth mothers, but very few  birth fathers, who come in. We also have  grandmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins.  We still help with applications for status and there are still a lot of people who  are affected by adoption who have no idea  what that means. We think it is not good  enough to know that you are registered or  not registered; you need to understand how  the Indian Act affected you and your fam-  ily.  Sandra: So you provide an education  about the history?  Lizabeth: Yes, people don't understand  Bill C-31. You have to put it into context of  what it was, what it is, and what it can do  to individuals and their family in the future. We did that for everybody at the UNN.  The Indian Act created a mindset, and if you  understand how your family got that  mindset, you might be more compassion-  from WELSH page 9  Andrea: So who are the films for?  Christine: My films are first and foremost for our own people—to tell our stories, to have our stories reflected back to  us, to open up conversation amongst ourselves. But they're also for non-Native people, I really see that with Kuper Island: Return to the Healing Circle. When I show it in  my classes, and I have mostly non-Native  students, I preface it by saying: "You're  meant to be here, you're part of this circle.  When the people in the film shared their  stories with me, and that initial bargain was  struck, it was because you were going to  hear it. They wanted you to hear it, and to  be changed by what you've heard."  I really believe that people participate  in these films because they're going to be  heard. That's part of the bargain. And so  for non-Native people watching the film, I  say, "Listen up, because you're part of this  story. Things won't change for Aboriginal  people in this country unless you're part  of that change. There's stuff we've got to  do, there's stuff you've got to do, and together we can make it happen. But first you  need to listen." It's not just about telling  these stories to our own people; it goes further than that.  ate, more patient or you might be more resourceful about how to resolve the family  conflict that the Indian Act creates. Bill C-  31's second generation cut off rule, people  having different categories of status, for example. Some people will forever be denied.  Why does that cause so much separation  within families? We need to understand  what the Indian Act does.  The UNN is a political organization  and our commitment to people is to help  them understand the impact of the Indian  Act. We don't want to become another Indian Affairs; we don't want to become another social services. We see adoption reunion and registry differently because  we're always changing and we're always  open to whatever people come with. Our  commitment is to stay with people until  their issues are resolved. People will come  back. I helped people who were reunited  in 1992, and they came back in 1999 with  more questions. They needed another piece  of the puzzle.  Sandra: Speaking from your own experiences—life experiences, work experiences—what sort of things do you see in  the future happening for Aboriginal  women?  Lizabeth: I've heard members of the  Aboriginal Women's Action Network  (AWAN) articulate that women are taking  the lead right now. I think this is good because the unsung heroes in my community  were always women. If you looked carefully, you wouldn't say that men had all  the power. In my family, a lot of the men  didn't get up to speak without first speaking with their grandmother. The Indian  Agent might have put him there but the  power lay with the women. I witnessed  that, I knew that, but I didn't talk about it.  Who talks about it? It's just something that  is. There are women like that all over—that  experience is not unique to us. Now I'm  bearing witness to that with AWAN. These  women are saying our voices are really  important and I'm going to use it. That  makes all the difference in the world. I see  that happening more and more.  The young people will be affected by  this.We have a really huge youth population now. It would be good if this movement continues to happen in other parts of  Indigenous country. I think it will because  of people like Fay Blaney and Rain Daniels  of AWAN, and Viola Thomas, president of  the UNN, who are taking on the challenges.  We are still fighting the paternalism in the  Indian Act. It's not easy to go against that.  Eventually, more women will say, "I think  that woman needs my support. I think I'll  go there."  Some people say the circle is getting  wider and the circle is going to come  around. I feel, I'm part of the circle—it's a  healing circle in a sense. I definitely believe  women are taking the lead on it.  It's not any different from the past. It's  not as if it went away. Again, it wasn't  talked about before, and now we're talking about it.  I think ten years ago when I was making a decision to change and to come back  into my own, one of the things I didn't say,  or didn't even think about consciously, was  that I was looking for a leader. I'm not  putting myself down—I don't think that I  can't lead—but I was looking for a leader.  Now I know what that means. It's not a  male political, Phil Fontaine-leader, I have  my own definition. I know it will be a  woman.  o you have any new projects  on the horizons? If so, what is compelling  you to tell this story?  Christine: I'm working on a film about  Two-Spirit women right now. The other  'Prairie Girl' in Prairie Girl films is Colleen  Craig who is a Two-Spirit woman from  Manitoba and she's also Metis. We're working on this project together which is something I've wanted to do for a long time.  Colleen and I went to the Two-Spirit  gathering in California this summer to start  work on the film and to do some filming  with the women who were there and they  were all really, really excited about it. I was  the only straight person in sight, which  was—for me—a really different place to be.  And a very humbling place to be.  They were really clear in saying: "that  doesn't matter, you're here and we want  you to do this." And again, "this is how we  want you to do this, this is what we'd like  it to be. It's going to be an interesting process to be involved in. And ideas keep coming along, but it's about the stories we need,  the stories that feed us, the stories that open  up the conversations that we need to be  having. They just keep coming...

DEC/JAN 2000 Native,Treaty, Non-Status, Metis, Indian, Inuit, Status, Indigenous,  queer thanksgiving  by Susan Beaver  This weekend is the weekend of  American Thanksgiving (November 25). It  is a time of celebrations, parades, football  games, shopping, and pleasant,  homey dinners with the family.  Here I sit, a woman, an indigenous woman, an indigenous, lesbian woman. I couldn't let the  days go by without doing something, and so I'm fasting.  From sundown Thursday to  noon Sunday, when I'll eat with  my queer friends, I'm praying for  the people. Praying for indigenous people, praying for the  women, praying for the queers,  praying for the people with HIV,  praying for all people who are  struggling.  I'll break my fast with an  older lesbian woman from India,  with a young dyke from Colorado,  with an FflV-i- gay man from California, and with a lesbian Jewish  sister from Massachusetts. Under  this roof that the Creator has so  graciously provided me and my partner  with, will be the newest members of my  family.  I am comfortable with them. The way  I feel inside is the way they feel to me. No  where else do I feel I belong. They are full  of energy; they are spiritual, queer, and  dedicated to a better world than the one  we've inherited. I will miss them when I  leave this place.  It's true I am homesick and need to live  somewhere closer to my rez than I am now,  but that may not happen. Living on the rez  is out of the question. It's too complicated;  my partner is not native and would draw  even more attention to the fact that one of  us isn't a guy. We've been together 10 years.  Some folks embrace us as we are. My  brother insists that my partner is his sister-  in-law. Some folks would rather I disappear. I came out to one of my cousins early  on in my relationship, and now she pre  tends she doesn't see me when she walks  by me in the grocery store. We were best  friends growing up and sometimes I think  it would have been nice to have been able  to share my adult life with her.  What am I doing with all this? When I  was a kid I was militantly Indian. My uncles taught me history and it wasn't pretty.  I was afraid to be queer even though I knew  from the age of seven. So I left the rez and  my people were never more important to  me. I learned how to pray. I learned how to  make love to other women and I became a  dyke. I wanted to make women happy and  save the world.  I became an activist, I wrote, I folded  and stuffed, I organized, I spoke and I tried.  How many of us remember sitting up all  night in prayer vigils for the people in  Kanesatake? Just pray and pray that no one  gets hurt. I used to run AIDS programs and  sat on Boards of Directors for non-profit  organizations. I used to march in  protests and stand toe-to-toe with  anti-choice extremists. What am I  doing with all of this?  I'm writing a novel and  maybe I'll go study comparative  religion in Jerusalem, if they'll  have me. I used to know what my  contribution was to the world, but  now I'm not so sure. A friend of  mine, an older indigenous woman  from the west coast, once told me  that we create the world by walking through it.  If that is so, then living as  close to the teachings and living  in such a way that brings good  things to creation, is vital. If that  is so, then it is my work to not  bring any more hatred to the  world. I think it's always important to me to do the things I do,  not because I hate the system or  colonization or homophobia. It's important  that I always do the things I do because I  love the people.  Maybe I do not know what my contribution is, but I do know what my base is.  It's a difficult world, to come out in. I  know of several Indians in the closet who  are being twisted up inside because our  world, their world or maybe just their family would not welcome them into their circle. And I'm not blaming our people, either. Generosity is one of the first laws  you'll encounter among our people, and  there are many elders out there who accept  queers as we are.  As queer   indigenous folks, we've  heard the stories of the different nations  who honoured the men who lived as  women and the women who lived as men.  It's a little thing called "colonization" that  has tried so hard to break the threads of  our nations.  In my not knowing, I am reminded that  one of my teachers told me daVinci said he  was able to do what he did, because he allowed confusion to permeate his life. I have  multiple aspects to my identity that have  allowed me to walk through many places  and meet many people. Perhaps my contribution will not be to find one contribution, but to allow the various circles of my  life to grow and be nurtured by diversity.  Perhaps my work is to be at home in  the confusion, in the world, and still take  two days to fast and pray. Perhaps my work  is to continue to be in a loving and respectful relationship with my partner. Perhaps  my work is to speak, as small and as scared  as my voice is. Perhaps my work is to learn  how to love and be loved.  One morning I was praying. I hadn't  prayed for a while. I stood in the morning  light and it occurred to me that what a  wonderful opportunity it is to pray. What  an amazing chance it is to be standing in  front of my creator, giving thanks and humbling asking for blessings on all of creation.  Here I am, at the end of my article, the  end of my fast, and near the end of the semester and I still don't know what my contribution is. The only thing I can do, really,  is wake up every morning. It takes a tremendous amount of faith for me to wake  up and get up each day. I didn't say struggle, I said "faith." Faith to do my best and  trust that creator's work will be done. It gets  me up every morning.  Susan Beaver is Mohawk from Six Nations.  She is currently finishing her degree in religious studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.

The European  settlements  which developed on Native  peoples' lands  were obsessed  with maintaining colonial control.  By rigidly  asserting differences between  'Europeans' and  'Natives,' they  were able to develop white social solidarity  and   cohesion  Gender has thus  been crucial to  determining not  only who has  been able to  stay in Native  communities,  but who has  been called  as such  among groups  of European settlers who had little else in common but the fact  that they weren't  Native people.  The very ex- i   istence of the settler society therefore depended on maintaining the strictest racial apartheid, on emphasizing racial difference, white superiority and 'Native' inferiority. This flies in  the face of the actual origins of French and  English settlements in North America—  which began with displaced and often  marginal white men, whose success with  trade and often their very survival depended on their ability to marry into Indigenous families, and who in many cases  had few loyalties to Europe and the empire.  In the early days of the fur trade and  French/English settlement, the boundaries  between who should be considered 'European' and who should be considered  'Native' were not always clear. In the east,  for example, French Acadian colonists not  only intermarried with Mi'kmaq people  but began to adopt their ways of life. This  was, of course, very troubling to colonial  authorities, who began to pass laws which  restricted intermarriage—and prevented  Native wives and children from inheriting  European family fortunes.  For English settlers, the fact that by  1830 there were over 50 Metis communities surrounding their settlements made it  difficult for them to maintain clear  boundaries between colonizers and colonized.  Social control depended on being able  to clearly identify who was white, entitled  to land and citizenship, and who was Native and denied these rights. Clearly, if the  mixed-race children of white men who  married Native women were to inherit  mixed-race' and  externalized  property, they had to be legally classified  as white.  As a result, in 1869, the Gradual Enfranchisement Act  was passed,  which stipulated  that any Native  woman who  married a non-  Native would  lose her Indian  status, and any  right to band  membership. It  was this statute  that, for the first  time, created the  legal categories  of "status Indian" and "nonstatus Indian."  Prior to this,  Canada had  made only one  attempt to define who was In-  dian—and it  was a loose, general, non-restrictive definition.  This, however,  could not allow  for the kind of  control that  would later  make a person   born     Native  (and her offspring) legally white. In order  to do this, 'Indianness' had to be legally  codified, to make it a category which could  be granted or withheld, according  to the needs of the settler society.  This legislation was incorporated into the Indian Act of 1876  and all subsequent revisions, until  1985. As a result, for 116 years, the  Indian Act removed the Native status of all Native women who married individuals without Native  status (including American Indi-     MB  ans), and, particularly after 1951,  forced them to leave their communities.  Creating the legal category of  "status Indian" enabled the settler  society to create the fiction of a  Native person who was by law no  longer Native, whose offspring  could be considered white. Because of the racist, patriarchal  framework governing white identities, European women who married Native men were considered  to have stepped outside the social boundaries of whiteness. They became, officially,  status Indians.  For Native communities, of this long-  term gender discrimination have been disastrous. The majority of the 25,000 Indians  who lost status and were forced to leave  their communities between 1876 and 1985  did so because of gender discrimination in  the Indian Act. By depriving these women  of status, the Indian Act not only removed  most of these 25,000 individuals from their  communities of origin—it removed their  children, grand-children and great grandchildren as well—and for the most part,  permanently. By the time Bill C-31 was  passed in 1985, and this form of discrimination ended, there were only 350,000 status Indians left in Canada.  After over a century of gender discrimination in the Indian Act, the idea that  it is somehow acceptable for Native women  to lose status for marrying non-status or  non-Native men has become a normalized  aspect of Native life in many communities.  As a result, the very notion of which Native people are considered to be 'mixed race'  is highly shaped by gender. The family histories of on-reserve Native people have routinely included the presence of white  women married to Native men, as well as  (in some cases) the children of Native  women who had babies by white men but  were not married to them. These experiences have not been seen, or theorized, as  'mixed-race' experiences.  The children of these unions have been  considered to be Native, and have never  had to leave their communities. Native reserves, particularly those adjacent to white  settlements, may have grown progressively  mixed-race under these circumstances—  but they have not been called mixed-race  communities, and on-reserve mixed-race  families have therefore not been externalized as mixed-race people.  On the other hand, the children of Native mothers and white or Metis fathers  who have been forced to leave their communities because of loss of status have  grown up as "urban Indians", who are frequently regarded as outsiders within their  home communities, because they are urban  and mixed race.  Gender has thus been crucial to determining not only who has been able to stay  in Native communities, but who has been  called 'mixed-race' and externalized as  such. In this respect, gender discrimination  in the Indian Act has shaped what we think  about who is Native, who is 'mixed-blood',  and who is entitled to access Indian land.  These beliefs are only rendered more powerful by the strongly protectionist attitudes  towards preserving Native culture as it is  lived on reserves at present where outsiders may be seen as profoundly threatening  to community identity.  Legislated control of Native identity  did not only happen along the lines of gender, however. A central aspect of how Native identity has been controlled in Canada  is through externalizing those who are considered mixed-blood from Indianness.  When Canada passed the Gradual Enfranchisement Act in 1869, a blood quantum requirement was added for the first time to  the definition of an Indian. After 1869, the  only people eligible to be considered Indian  were those who had at least one-quarter  Indian blood.  With the expansion of Canada into the  western regions of the continent, however,  officials in the Indian Department, in negotiating treaties with the new Nations they  encountered, began the practice of exerting much more stringent controls over who  would be accepted as Indian. As a result,  when the Indian Act was created in 1876, it  contained a provision which, for the first  time, excluded anybody who was not considered to be "pure Indian" from  Indianness.  It stated that:".. .no half-breed head of  a family (except the widow of an Indian,  or a half-breed who has already been admitted into a treaty) shall...be accounted  an Indian, or entitled to be admitted into  any Indian treaty." (Canada,Indian Act, Section 3,1876. R.S.C., 1951)  But who was "Indian" and who was  "half-breed"? These distinctions have been  created and negotiated, to a tremendous extent, by colonial categorization, as well as  being regulated by them. While  many Metis communities have  had extremely different histories  and have been very distinct culturally from status Indian communities, in some instances the  differences between Indians' and  so-called 'halfbreeds' have been  quite minor.  WHKHi        Most Native bands have had  mixed-race members. Marriages  between halfbreeds and treaty  Indians has always been a reality.  Many people of Native heritage  have been eligible for either treaty  or Metis scrip, and the extent to  which they chose one or the other  has often depended on the  choices that either category provide. [From the 1870s to the 1920s,  Metis people were excluded from the  treaty process. Instead, they were offered a "scrip" which entitled them  to 160 acres of land or $160, in exchange for  their individual and collective rights.]  In some cases, whole families were  split, with some family members opting to  'become' Metis while others opted to 'become' status Indians.  see IDENTITY page 18  DEC/JAN 2000  KH^pIS '  Native,Treaty, Non-Status, Metis, Indian, Inuit,!

This long history of government control has been a central tool of genocide, and still shapes how  many of us see "Indianness" today.  On top of this, for urban Native people, especially if we are of mixed ancestry,  the images of "Indianness" presented to us  in mainstream culture, and the academic  assumptions about what "Indianness" is,  often encourage us to hold a yardstick to  our lives and our families' lives. This yardstick measures to what extent we should  be considered "really" Native—how Native  we look, whether we have status or not,  how much we know about our culture—In  essence, how much Native can we be said  to be.  Talking about mixed-race urban Native  identity may seem to simply be falling into  the trap which white society sets for us—  of weighing and measuring "Indianness"  to see how well we fit. Many people have  responded to the divisions created by government classification and control by insisting simply that "we are all Native people—  the differences between us are not important."  While this is a valuable step, it often  ignores the experiences of many Native  people who are mixed-race and urban, who  need to explore the ways that we don't always fit into Native society.  More importantly, it erases the power  differences between those who can "pass"  as white and those who must face racism  for being Native on a regular basis for looking Native. It also ignores the very real differences in entitlement that exist between  status and non-status Indians, and to a  growing extent, between urban and reserve-based Native people.  If we avoid addressing the very real  differences among us, it makes it impossible for those of us who are very mixed race  and from heavily assimilated families to ask  the crucial questions we may need to ask  ourselves: Are we not in some ways potentially a liability for Native communities?  Are we not (for example) at risk of bringing "New Age" influences into the culture  simply through our lack of exposure to  those whose world views are shaped by traditional language and culture? Does looking white mean that we may find it easier  to take on leadership positions which we  may not be good at because we lack deep  knowledge of our own culture?  I want to emphasize that I am not suggesting that we are in any way liabilities to  our communities—merely that we should  be prepared to ask ourselves that, and frequently. At the same time, I also believe that  the tremendous diversity that mixed race  urban Native people represent—in appearance, in lived experience, in our mixed cultural background—can actually be a  strength, rather than a weakness, for Native people as a whole. We do, after all,  bring a wealth of experiences and access to  different resources into the Native community with us. In doing so, we make them  "Native resources."  With all this in mind, I decided that the  research for my PhD would be the experiences of urban mixed-race Native people  in the Toronto area.  Who I interviewed  I conducted lengthy, in-depth interviews with 22 women and eight men on  the subject of their identities. I began with  my own friends, and then interviewed their  friends. I moved outwards from the circle  until I had found 30 people. I interviewed  far more women than men, simply because  I know far more Aboriginal women than  men. Yet, I did not want to make my thesis  only about Native women.  Why didn't I concentrate solely on  Native women? My main reason was the  tremendous under-representation of Native  people in universities at present. My entire  student life was spent in settings where  there was virtually no Native presence—  where almost nobody at the university  could be considered as representing Aboriginal people in any way. To focus solely  on Aboriginal women, in a setting where  Aboriginal people as a whole were absent,  seemed inappropriate. To be effective in  such a context, my research had to speak  across that silent space for a whole people,  not just the female half of it.  Almost one-third of the interviewees  were status Indians. Most were Ojibway  and Mohawk people whose families came  from nearby reserves. Another one-third  were Metis people from Western Canada.  The rest were non-status Native people  from Indigenous Nations all over the  Americas.  All were mixed-race of white and Native heritages, but one person was also of  African-American background and another  was half Japanese.  We talked about family histories, experiences of belonging and not-belonging,  and opinions about what was important for  maintaining a strong sense of Native identity.  Histories of genocide  The family histories of the participants  told similar stories. Each family had undergone many painful experiences of violence,  which had had the effect of separating them  from their communities or silencing Native  cultural expression within their families.  Almost half of the people I interviewed had  parents and grandparents who still attended residential schools.  For many of them, being urban started  with their grandparents or parents never  returning home after residential school.  Several individuals also came from families so devastated by alcoholism and sexual  abuse because of residential schooling and  racism, that for years they struggled to disown any connection to their Native identity.  One-quarter of the interviewees had  experienced loss of close family members—  their parents, siblings or children—to provincial child welfare authorities, either temporarily or permanently. For five of them,  the adoption of their Native parent signalled the end of any connection to their  Native community of origin.  Two East Coast participants came from  families who had been forced off their ancestral lands by Loyalist settlers. They had  barely managed to maintain their identities  as Native people, after two centuries of  being surrounded by hostile whites who  targetted individuals who dared to openly  speak their language.  One woman spoke of how her band  had been forced from their land in New  Brunswick into what is now the United  States. The band was so decimated that  only 56 people remained when it launched  a land claim in the 1970s. Several of the  Western Metis came from families who had  fled to the US to escape  persecution in Canada  after        the        1885  rebellionfin 1885, a huge  invading force of soldiers  from Eastern Canada was  sent to Saskatchewan to  quell what white people  considered to be a "Native  Canada. In the end, Metis  leader Louis Riel and 11  Cree leaders were executed,  and scores of other Metis  and Cree people were im-  Hf prisoned.]  |H All of these indi-  Jviduals spoke of their  families' struggles as  landless Metis forced to  live in white urban centres. Distancing  themselves from their Native  identity in the face of the relentless racist  violence they faced, was, for many, a necessary step to ensure basic survival.  Almost unnoticed initially in these stories of suffering and alienation was the loss  of Indian status. The Metis people described how their status Indian grandmothers "became" Metis by marrying Metis  men.  Others spoke of living off-reserve for  generations and of never having had status.  Others described their mothers' losing and  regaining status, or losing status themselves  for marrying non-Natives.  Nineteen individuals came from families where one or both grandparents had  Native status; however, only 12 of them had  status themselves, and only five would be  able to pass status on to their children. For  all but eight of them, loss of status had separated their families from their reserves forever.  Other Western Metis people interviewed, although they were from families  who were dark-skinned, Cree-speaking and  indistinguishable from Cree Indians in any  way other than status, had never been  granted status for a variety of reasons. That  meant they were always designated  "Metis." These individuals suffered from  racism, yet lacked the treaty rights to education, health care, or off-season hunting  which would have made their lives significantly better.  Other individuals who had no status  came from Native communities outside of  Canada—a couple of people had American  Indian federal recognition, two were American Indians whose families were not on the  tribal rolls of their Nations, and one was  from South America.  From the interviews, it appeared that  being deprived of, or losing, Indian status  was one of the central methods by which  Native peoples were removed from their  communities. Status was the primary  source, not only of their livelihood, but also  of their identity.  The family histories, however, outlined  certain differences in experience between individuals as well. One issue was whether  people came from families who had been  mixed-race for more than one generation.  This was important for two reasons.  For those urban people whose families  had been mixed-race for at least one generation, Native identity was silenced in profound ways. The children and grandchildren of these families were most often uncertain as to who they were and where they  came from. These individuals, in returning  to their Native communities, often had to  negotiate between family members who no  longer identified as Native and communities which expected anybody who identified as Native to be "100 percent Indian" in  blood and experience. The label "wannabe"  was most often applied to them.  Then, there was the experience of individuals whose families were mixed-race but  which had managed to stay on reserve. It  was clear from these peoples' stories that  their parents had occupied positions of authority in Native communities because they  were light skinned. One individual, whose  light-skinned mother taught in fly-in Native communities, described being brought  up to avoid other Native children and to  only play with the white girl whose parents  ran the store on the reserve.  Differences in experience between status Indians and Metis people in Western  Canada were occasionally discussed in the  interviews. One Metis person, despite the  racism he suffered while growing up in the  white society, saw Metis people as much  better off than status Indians because they  did not have to go to residential school.  Another individual talked about how  her dark-skinned Metis mother, in the face  of the alcoholism and physical and sexual  abuse, envied status Indians because they  could get away from violence and alcoholism by going away to [residential] school.  (As I did not interview any status Indians from Western Canada, the "status Indian" side of the picture was not explored,  although many of the Metis had status Indian grandmothers).  What stood out in the interviews was  that despite differences of light skin or dark  skin, having or lacking status, and being  urban or on-reserve, the family histories of  all of the participants were amazingly similar. In terms of history, they mostly told the  same story. In terms of their present experiences, however, the participants showed  considerable differences especially with respect to appearance and status. In an urban community such as Toronto, where the  Native community is trying to de-emphasize difference in order to promote community, it might be important to explore some  of these differences more closely.  Appearance  Twelve of the 30 people I interviewed  were indistinguishable in appearance from  white people. About one-third were very  dark and did not even appear to be mixed-  race. The remainder were people who  looked non-white but not necessarily Native. As urban Native people, surrounded  by a non-Native society which sees  "Indianness" solely as a matter of race, appearance is crucially important. This is true  especially to those who are adoptees or who  grew up in families where Native identity  was denied.  Peoples' experiences with having an  appearance that did not fit their identity  ranged from almost tragic to surreal. Tragic,  in the case of two white-looking individuals whose parents had been adopted off-  reserve and never reunited with their families, who did not even attempt to reconnect  with their communities of  origin because they knew  they would simply be turned  away as "white people." Surreal, in the case of one white-  looking woman who, on being arrested for drunk and  disorderly conduct with a  group of other Native people, was pulled from the cell  and lectured to by a paternalistic white police chief  about the dangers of "hanging around with Indians."  Among interviewees  who had grown up in families which disregarded their  Native heritage, the darker  skinned people spoke of  how validating it was to join  the Native community, and  how, in particular, the elders  were a source of strength to  them, for seeing them as really being Native. By comparison, the white-looking individuals who grew up alienated from their  communities spoke of how devastating it  was when elders ignored and rejected  them—this seemed to be the ultimate expression that they weren't really Native.  Most of the people simply described  routine daily experiences as alternating between rejection and affirmation. They talked  of coming from Native  environments where  they were known and  trusted, and then moving into other Native  environments where  they were viewed with  suspicion and hostility.  They talked of how  wearying it was to negotiate the same reactions year after year,  and how difficult they  found it at times to  maintain a sense of  trust around other Native people in the face  of such ever-changing  circumstances.  A few people delib-  erately limited their  contact with other Native people and worked in non-Native environments to avoid rejection.  This was much more common with  white-looking women than white-looking  men. While the groups are too small and  not balanced in numbers enough to be statistically sound, we cannot ignore the fact  that each of the six white-looking men interviewed was working in the Native community, while three of the five white-looking women spoke of not fitting into the  Native community and chose to work in  white environments. This suggests that  white-looking Native women might find it  more difficult to negotiate a place in the  Native community than their male counterparts.  One woman, a brilliant student, spoke  of her decision to not go into law because  it struck her that it was difficult enough for  a Native woman to practice law without  having to constantly face hostility for being a Native woman lawyer who looked  white. By comparison, one of the white-  looking men was a lawyer and while he  saw his appearance as a problem in certain  contexts, he never saw it as a career barrier.  Gender disparity also existed around  poverty and wealth in other respects. Of the  poorest and least-educated people I interviewed, the least-educated man (a white-  looking individual with a Grade 6 education and a criminal record) was a thriving  artist and activist, while the three least-educated women (all with Grade 11 education  and with no criminal records) were on welfare (including two of the white-looking  women).  A similar gender difference existed  with respect to the issue of choice of partner. While all of the white-looking women  I interviewed mentioned that Native men  did not seem to want them because they  were too white-looking, only one out of six  white-looking men made this comment  about Native women.  Because most of the white-looking individuals interviewed witnessed the racism  which darker siblings or parents faced  every day, they were often quite clear that  looking white protected them from racism  in ways they could not ignore.  Most, however, did not have much  sense of the extent of privilege they enjoyed,  through having white skin. They were  aware they were not targeted for racist hostility but they did not acknowledge how  much easier it was for them to rent an apartment, apply for a bank loan or a job in the  mainstream, or deal with government bureaucracy with a white appearance.  Darker-skinned Native people made  comments about certain individuals not  being really Indian, implying that these individuals were actually white people pretending to be Indian.  Implicit in their criticism was that  when white-looking people claim their  Native identity, it is purely self-serving and  only weakens darker skinned Native people who have to compete against them for  jobs, not only in the mainstream, but in the  Native community as well.  It is clear that attempts by people in  the Toronto Native community to disregard  the importance of looking Indian in the interest of overcoming divisions do not account for the ongoing racism in Canadian  society which continues to oppress people  who look Native.  Having white-looking people identify  with their Native heritage may provide opportunities for these individuals to promote  Native empowerment from a position of  strength. However, unless divisions around  appearance are actually addressed (respectfully), the different circumstances white-  looking and dark-skinned Native people  face will continue to be unspoken.  In a different light, two of the dark-  skinned people I interviewed spoke of how  they were often made unwelcome not because of their appearance, but because they  are too culturally different. Both women—  an African Cherokee from the United States  and a Mapuche woman from Chile—spoke  of how they are seen as too "multicultural"  in the urban Native community in Toronto.  It appears that people who are mixtures of Native and white, (particularly if  the white background is Anglo-Canadian),  are more easily accepted in the urban com-  . munity than those who are Native and  Black, or who are Native in appearance but  who speak Spanish or another non-Indigenous language other than English.  This is problematic, especially since the  future generation of urban Native people  in Toronto will likely be more multiracial,  given the high rates of contemporary inter-marriage between people of colour and  Native people. The next decade will probably signify a radical shift in our understanding of what it means to be urban Native people, as people of multiple cultural  backgrounds—whose non-Native heritages  are from all around the world—struggle to  create new, hybrid Native identities which  still affirm their connections to Indigenous  communities.  Status  While divisions between those who  look Native and those who look white are  at least negotiable among the people I interviewed, the issue of being status or nonstatus or Metis represented a fundamental  division which could not be surpassed.  Everybody I interviewed asserted loftily, as if it was all too obvious, that status  had nothing to do with whether one is a  Native person or not. At the same time, almost everybody, when pressed, admitted  that they did feel status Indians were more  Native than non-status Indians or Metis.  The status Indians I interviewed frequently indicated their determination that  they would only have children with partners who would enable them to pass their  see GENOCIDE next page Indigenous, Halfbreed, On-Reserve, Aboriginal, First Nations, Off-  from GENOCIDE previous page  status on to their children. They expressed  the view that status was the only thing protecting Native people from genocide.  The non-status Indians and Metis, on  the other hand, saw the divisiveness which  status creates as being the greatest challenge  Native people face.  One issue which became clear throughout the interviews was the range of experiences Native people have with respect to  status. Some of the interviewees had multiple experiences in their family of gaining  and losing status (losing it through enfranchisement or marriage to a non-Native, and  then regaining it through marriage to a status Indian prior to 1985.)  Some came from families where some  siblings were status and some non-status,  depending on whether their mothers were  married to their fathers at the time of birth.  Two could not regain status because their  grandfathers had been born in the US; their  families had fled there to escape persecution after the 1885 uprising. One woman  was a federally recognized American Indian whose band came originally from  Canada but had been pushed south by Loyalist settlers.  In Canada, where her family had always lived—a stone's throw from the reserve boundaries at theAmerican border—  she was considered non-status. A number  of individuals could not regain status because of the second-generation cutoff with  Bill C-31.  Status for many people has been  granted or removed in a purely arbitrary  fashion which had nothing to do with their  family's experiences. Yet, among the people I interviewed, it (in conjunction with  band membership) remains a fundamental dividing line between experiences of  "Indianness," marking clear divisions  around entitlement and non-entitlement.  This is despite attempts by each individual  I interviewed to minimize its importance  through statements such as, "status has  nothing to do with who is Native."  Urban Native people, who are struggling valiantly to make their own defini  tions of who is Native and who isn't, do  not seem able to easily come to terms with  the issue of status. This suggests that government regulation of Native identity has  far more power over different groups than  is frequently acknowledged.  Status is more than a matter of "believing in" government categories—it is, above  all (along with band membership) the fundamental determinant of who has access,  fyW^v  or who should have access, to whatever  fragments of land still remain in Indian  hands.  Every government action related to  Native people—whether it is a funding decision, a change in policy, or a response to  a land claim—enhances divisions on the  basis of status. Clearly, it is not enough to  simply say "status has nothing to do with  being Indian" as a means of overcoming  divisions. Those divisions are about entitlement, particularly to funding, but also  to land.  The future  A major issue which concerned everybody I interviewed was the future of urban Native people. Most individuals felt  that, in addition to strengthening knowledge of culture and building a strong urban infrastructure of Native organizations  to service the needs of the community,  building closer ties to reserve communities  was important.  For many, this reflected their own feelings about being urban,  and their own, personal  relationships to their  community of origin—  their understanding of  what extent they would  be able to undo past  losses through rebuilding ties and relearning  their language (for example).  The conversation  returned, again and  again, to the manner in  which urban Native  WM people have no real or-  BP ganic forms of connec-  B? tion to reserve commu  nities. How can we  work to rebuild our Indigenous nations when  as urban people we do  not have membership in  any First Nation? And  why is the current network of over 600 tiny "matchbook" size  communities occupying less than one percent of the traditional landmass seen as the  only viable expression of nation-building?  What about the growing number of urban  Natives who have no home communities  to return to?  In talking about the future, developing new forms of nation-building was discussed. Some individuals felt all urban nonstatus individuals should join the Metis nation as an advocacy group, while working  towards being "adopted" back into their  home communities. Others were angry  about not having their status reinstated or  having band membership denied them,  and felt that regaining membership which  their mothers had lost was the primary direction for empowerment.  A number of individuals recognized  that there is no "going back" for most of  us. We cannot rebuild ourselves as "full-  blooded traditionalists" in the communities from which our parents or grandparents were separated. Embracing different  forms of nation-building—such as revitalizing the traditional confederacies which  were the forms of political organization in  existence at the time of colonization—is  only beginning.  Revitalizing the Wabanaki Confederacy along the eastern seaboard, or the  Blackfoot Confederacy in what is now Alberta and the northern US, or building new  geopolitical units such as the Cree Nation  and the Anishnabek Nation seems to be the  most promising route to take out of the government-regulated divisions among Native  people.  However, without a deep understanding of how these divisions have been imposed on us, there is a danger that these  rebuilt or new forms will develop the same  divisions as before, such as restricting citizenship to status Indians, as the present  Indian Act system does. If urban and nonstatus Native people embrace these alternate political frameworks, it could do much  to strengthen the more traditional organisations, to the empowerment of all of us.  Wel'alioq!

She has been doing traditional  singing and hand drumming for a few years  now, as well as serving on the board of directors of Anduhyaun Inc., which operates a shelter, a daycare centre, second stage housing and  other programs for Native women in Toronto.  from IDENTITY page 15  It has been the Indian Act which has  played the largest role not only in creating  the separate category of 'halfbreed' in regions where no such concept existed, but  in forcibly externalizing mixed-race people  from Native communities.  The process of differentiating between  'Indians' and 'halfbreeds' did not necessarily conform either to actual racial blood  quantum or to individual self-identification. In the 50 year interval during which  treaties one to 11 were negotiated with the  Native bands across Western Canada and  the subarctic, treaty commissioners in each  location set up tables where potential  'halfbreeds' were to present themselves,  individual by individual, to be judged by  white officials as to what they were.  In a context where racial mixing was  frequently difficult to determine, factors  such as lifestyle, language and residence  were employed. Thus ascribed, an individual became, irrevocably, Indian or  halfbreed (as did their descendants). Many  Native families who were away when registration was first carried out never made  treaty lists and ended up being classified  as halfbreeds.  Indeed, whole bands who were absent  during treaty signing similarly lost any  chance of acquiring Native status and became, de facto (on paper), 'halfbreed' communities. (In other parts of Canada, where  the treaties did not expressly separate  'halfbreeds' from 'Indians,' in the way that  the numbered treaties in Western Canada  did, such individuals were usually considered to be "non-status Indians".  The government frequently sought to  'winnow out' from Indianness all who  could be claimed to be Metis. In 1879, the  Indian Act was amended to enable individuals to withdraw from treaty, to take  scrip and be counted as Metis. Because of  the widespread destitution on the newly  created Indian reserves, and because  halfbreed money scrip could immediately  be cashed, a rush to leave treaty status on  the part of some bands, regardless of ancestry, ensued, until regulations were created which ensured that individuals who  "led the mode of life of Indians" were not  to be granted discharge from treaty.  In rare cases, individuals who were  known to be half or three-quarters Indian  and were said to be following "an Indian  way of life", who were destitute and prevented by hunting regulations from living  off the land, were allowed to be taken into  treaty. The numbered treaties were thus crucial to the project of forcibly identifying and  segregating 'halfbreeds' from 'Indians', regardless of how individuals saw themselves.  If the preceding history clarifies anything, it is that both "Indian" and "Metis"  identities have been shaped to a phenomenal extent by discriminatory legislation in  the Indian Act. In this sense, to view these  groups solely as the products of entirely  different histories and the bearers of entirely  different destinies belies the common origins of both groups, as members of Aboriginal nations who faced colonization pressures in different ways, or who were classified in different ways by colonial legislation.  Treaty Indians and the Metis—like status and non-status Indians in general—represent two very distinct sides of a common  history, where one side, the Metis, have  been forcibly externalized from Indianness,  deprived of their rights as Aboriginal peoples, and given little option but to pursue  an entirely separate path to empowerment.

SIS  DEC/JAN 2000 Reserve, Bill C-31, Native,Treaty, Non-Status, Metis, Indian, Inuit,  "About That Question  ii  by Anna Marie Sewell  Aboriginal. It's such a big term. And it  seems so important. And within it, it seems  so important to clarify and classify in detail—treaty, non-status, metis, inuit,  halfbreed, on-reserve, off-reserve, bill c-  31...and so on. I sure sympathise sometimes  with anyone who struggles to be clear  about what it all means, and why it's important. A lot of really wise and strong people have worked long and hard to clarify it  all, and the stakes are high. I understand  only a little of it all. Just had to say that so  you'd know what an idiot is talking to you  here.  And I have to add thanks to all those  hard-working, caring people, for their part  in the struggle to keep beautiful traditions  and understandings and people alive, in  very difficult situations. But this is not  about history. It's just a crabby rant about  how sometimes I want to snap, when people ask me to justify myself in terms of my  racial lineage. I love being asked who I am  and where I'm from out of interest. Who  doesn't? I love finding that out about other  people. I understand that sometimes it  gives us information that can protect our  vitals, but sometimes, in some situations, I  get tired of being asked That Question.  That question bugs me when it comes  from white liberals who just want to appear hip, enlightened and concerned about  the Indian Problem (thank you, by the way,  for classifying me as a problem. It shows  you're not completely stupid, because, Jack,  I Am a Problem, and to people like you, I  won't be easily solved.)  That question bugs me when it comes  from fearful or jealous natives, who have  just felt challenged by me, by my words and  actions (I am a sometime teacher, and a director, and I am demanding, because those  things are my job; being Aboriginal is not).  That question bugs me when it's asked  by people who want to revere me for my  Ancient Indian Wisdom. (First, I have to get  over the laughability of that concept—revere me?!—but it has happened).  So, here, for those times when you may  feel the same annoyance and frustration,  are some snappy replies to various variations on That Question:  Q:   "So. What are you?"  A:   "Possibly Human. Yourself?"  Q:   "What's your tribal affiliation?"  A:    "Say what, Jack? Speak English to  me."  Q:   "I mean, what's your Nation?"  A:    "So, is this replacing 'What's your  sign?' as a red flag signifying sleazy intentions masquerading as interest, or  what?"  Q: "What Nation are you? "  A: "Today, I am Bulgaria. Tomorrow, I  may be Italy. If I lose weight, I could try  for Chile...." (and smile smugly, cause  injuns ain't supposed to know geography, doncha know; and wouldn't it throw  them way off if you said you were Eritrea  or East Timor or some other under-recognised people who struggle as we do  to be recognised and respected both as  individuals and as a larger, political, cultural entity?....or, let me respond to that  again...)  Q:   "What Nation are you?"  A:    "I am not a Nation. Oh, no. I'm  much bigger than that. I'm a continent.  And not just any continent. No, I am the  Lost Continent of Mu, and I have come  with a message of Timeless Wisdom just  for You.

Q:   "Well, you don't look Indian....?"  A:   "Listen, Jack, I didn't pose for the  old US Nickel, or the logo for the Chicago Blackhawks, or the Barbiehontas  cartoon, if that's what you mean. But I  am of aboriginal heritage."  Q:   "Really? You're Indian? So, What are  you?"  A: "Convinced that you can't win them  all and thankful for all the times you can;  and, for the record, I have nothing against  persons named Jack. Jack is a fine name."

Discovering the  Inner Indian  by Anna M. Sewell and Crystal Lee  Clark   It's been hundreds of years now since  we started importing Europeans here to  Turtle Island. Despite various programs  aimed at maintaining genetic purity, crossbreeding has been inevitable from the start.  The odd thing is, somehow, some people  have grown up ignorant of their Turtle Islander bloodlines and inheritance. You  wouldn't think it was possible, but it is.  Today, many seemingly 'white' people  wander in a wilderness of confusion, unaware of the identity of that strange thing  inside, that part of them that rears up from  time to time in the course of their lives,  causing inexplicable behaviours and reactions—as if they are host to some colonizing agent.  If this dilemma sounds familiar, this  little questionnaire is for you. Gentle reader,  be you the scion of wealthy New England  Republicans, be you the uneasy heir to generations of Victorian Royalists, be you an  Aryan poster child marked only by a  strange propensity to tan easily, whomever  you are, if you can answer yes to these simple questions, you may be the lucky owner  of an Inner Indian.  1.  When square dancing, do you  compulsively round off the corners?  2. In a deli full of fancy prepared  meats, does the bologna speak to  you? By name?  3. Do you tend to start formal speeches,  addresses and presentations with  "So anyhow...?"  4. Have you compulsively shouted  'Bingo!' in any of the following  situations: at a football game when  the quarterback is calling a play,  during Hamlet, when the actor asks  '2B or not 2B'; during the countdown  to launch a space mission?*  5. Do you talk to trees? Do trees talk to  you?  6. Do you possess an uncanny ability to  tell time by the sun, and get irritated  by the great mass of associates who  always want to start a half-hour early?  7. Are you incredibly good-looking?  8. Do you see right through all that car-  manufacturers' propaganda about  'seats five comfortably?'  9. When asked how many people are  in your family, do you answer 'it  depends.'  10. Are you seized by the urge to block  ade, even in unlikely situations—  at McDonald's, in public washrooms,  etc.?  11. Do you instinctively hate the song  "White Christmas"?  12. Do you take natural phenomena—  passing birds, thunderstorms, road-  killed chipmunks, and so on—  personally?  13. Do you have super-strong lips and/  or chin and the ability to give  directions with your hands full?**  *This actually happened to one of the  founders of our Institute, who was a highly-  paid NASA official until his inner Indian  spoke up and freed him from that commitment, giving him both the inspiration and  the time to help us begin our work.  **This symptom alone might also point  to an Inner African, Inner Asian, et cetera.  So anyhow, gentle reader, if you have  answered yes to a significant number (say  four, for example) of these questions, do not  hesitate to contact us here at the Institute  for Newly Discovering the Inner Aboriginal Now (INDIAN).

I am fortunate  to have the dual honour  of both reviewing My  Home As I Remember and  of having my first published piece (a short  story)—previously  printed in a newspaper  I write for—also published in it.  NWIA is a non-profit organization  founded in Toronto in 1993 by Sandra  Laronde. Laronde hails from Teme-  Augama-Anishnabe ("the deep water people") in Temagami, Ontario. She is an actor  as well as a writer. On top of her work at  NWIA, Laronde is the co-artistic director  at Native Earth PerformingArts in Toronto.  "I felt the need for a way for the voices  of Native women to be heard beyond the  confines of their own communities,"  Laronde explains in describing why she  undertook starting NWIA. "The primary  goal was to create an organization that  serves Native women from diverse nations  "I feit the need for a  way for the voices of  Native women to be  heard beyond the  confines of their own  communities"  and artistic disciplines  who share the common interest of culture,  art, community."  One of NWIA's  most far-reaching  projects is its literary  arts journal, which  publishes short stories,  poetry, biographies,  visual art, photographs, and more by  Indigenous women  from around the  world. With every  journal that they publish, Native Women in  the Arts is accomplishing that goal.  The first two journals published by  NWIA, in a vast dreaming (1996) and  Sweetgrass Grows All  Around Her (1998),  highlight the literary  and visual art work of  Native women in  North America. This  latest offering broadens its scope to include  works by Indigenous  women from Hawai'i,  New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, as well  as, of course, North  America. Each journal  features the creative  work of more than 50 women.  The first two journals were produced  with funding support from the Toronto Arts  Council. A broader base of funding was garnered for this third journal, with grants  coming from the Canada Council Block  Grant Program, Toronto Arts Council and  the National Aboriginal Achievement  Awards, with assistance from the Association for the Export of Canadian Books.  My Home As I Remember is co-edited  by Sandra Laronde and Lee Maracle, who  is a member of the Sto:  lo Nation of British Columbia. Maracle is the  author of several literary works—Bobbi Lee:  Indian Rebel, Ravensong  and I Am Woman, to  name just a few—and  is currently living in  Ontario and working at  the Barrie Friendship  Centre. Both these  women are well-respected in artistic and  Native communities as  accomplished writers and activists.  As I write this review, My Home As I  Remember is in the final stages of being published by NWIA, in partnership with Natural Heritage Publications. We can expect to  see it on the shelves by the beginning of  2000. (I can tell you—as a sneak preview—  that there is a new feature inside: 16-pages  of full-colour photographs).  The journal presents work by women  ranging in age from the young (those who  are newly entering their womanhood) to  Elders (grandmothers in their own right).  All the contributors speak from the heart  on identity and place in relation to their  "The women in  this book braid their  strands of memory of  home from the perspective of our origins, and our current  womanhood"  own individual concept of home, be that  what it may.  In this landmark volume, 62 writers  and visual artists are represented from  nearly 25 Nations, including some who are  well-known and some who are published  here for the first time. It's interesting to note  that most of the contributors have not been  previously published in NWIA's journals.  New feasts to savour.  In presenting the work of 153 Aboriginal women over the years, NWIA continues its unique and critical role in promot-  ingAboriginal women's literature, not just  within Canada, but also throughout other  Indigenous territories around the world.  In explaining the theme of this latest  journal, Maracle says:  "The braiding together of Home,  Memory and Native Women in this book  has such simple and elegant significance...  Home is for us origin, the shell of  nurturance, our first fire and the harbinger  of our relationship to the world. Home is  the domain of women. For all of us, the  memory of home is more than physical,  geographical, emotional or even spiritual.  "Stone is the foundation of the beginnings of the natural world. From stone  springs all our songs, our aspirations and  our dream world. From stone sings out the  story of the world of Turtle Island and our  relationships to earth, flora, fauna, sky and  star worlds. Home is our first stone. The  stone from which humans shape relationship. The perception of home in the pages  of this work tells us about how the women  in this book see themselves and what  shaped the governing principles in their  lives.  "The women in this book braid their  strands of memory of home from the perspective of our origins, and our current  womanhood; in the process, we reaffirm  cultural origins, explore ourselves and experience rebirth. Memory takes on life, social significance, feminist governance, sociological future, and then returns to the  heart as a beautiful gemstone."  Here's just one of the gems in My Home  as I Remember—this one's from Kimberly  Blaeser:  In the locked house of memory  old spirits rise, sing rockabye.  Rounded vowels soften our sleep  oohing like pine wind  sweeping through our dreams  stardusting us with longing.  Keep your eyes peeled for My Home as I  Remember in the new year!

If we are not directly  the victims of violence ourselves, we undoubtedly know someone who has been  victimized, and the threat of violence  shapes and confines our movement on a  daily basis.  Violence against women is an inherent  part of mainstream media images, Canadian literature, and the English language.  As a result of ongoing feminist struggle, the  Canadian government has established laws  and consequences for the perpetrators of  violence against women, in efforts to minimize or at least "manage" violent acts in  our society. However, most of these efforts  are in vain, as women continue to be victimized at greater and greater rates on national as well as global scales.  Aboriginal women and sex trade  workers (particularly street-involved  women) live with violence and death on a  daily basis, with little, if any, justice being  sought on their behalf by those people who  are in positions of power in Canadian society, such as police, judges, and both Canadian and Indigenous government officials.  Women working in prostitution are estimated to be 40 times more likely to die violent deaths than the average Canadian.  For Aboriginal women, this is in addition to the already horrifying situation in  Native communities,  in which mortality  rates are very high  due to suicides, poverty, substance  abuse, child abuse,  the quickly climbing  rates of HIV and  AIDS infection and  other atrocities of  colonization.  Of the total  population of Aboriginal people in  Canada in 1991, an  estimated 51 percent  were women. At this  time, the life expectancy of Aboriginal  women was 75 years,  seven years longer  than for Aboriginal  men, but nearly six  years less than other  Canadian women. Additionally, Aboriginal youth suicide rates are five to six times  higher than for non-Aboriginal youth.  Violence against women is just one  more component of the ideology of white  colonizers, which has been imposed on and  indoctrinated into Aboriginal communities.  Of course, Aboriginal communities were  not devoid of violence in some forms prior  to colonization, but the level of violence and  types of violence were certainly not at the  degree of insanity in which we now live.  Many Aboriginal women who live in  the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver have  migrated there from their reserves or home  communities in order to escape the colo-  Violence against  Aboriginal  prostitutes is not  an "Aboriginal  issue" largely  because men are  setting the  agenda  nial legacies of violence and poverty. Aboriginal women migrate from all over  Canada to this area, where they find an opportunity to escape from familial violence  and abuse, and to disappear into a large  city with a large Aboriginal community.  For some women living on reserve,  there are so many forces shaping their lives,  forces such as substance abuse, poverty, isolation, sexual abuse and violence, that going to a large city and entering into the sex  trade is the only way out. For some, this is  a decision they see they can make, taking  charge of their lives, instead of living in a  community in which they have no choices.  In the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, as in other urban areas across Canada,  the situation for Aboriginal women is grim.  Significant numbers of women are killed  or go missing each year. From 1991 to February 1999, almost 200 women died violent  deaths in this area of Vancouver alone. In  1997 alone, 32 women died and countless  others went missing. Community agencies  are constantly putting up posters in windows announcing the disappearance of yet  another woman, many of whom are very  young and many of whom are sex trade  workers.  Most of the people living in this area  are very poor and have inadequate or no  housing. Many people have addictions to  drugs and alcohol with limited access to  treatment facilities, have little if any opportunity for legal employment, and have  very little regard  given to their lives  by mainstream society. This is, in effect,  an Aboriginal  ghetto, as the numbers of Aboriginal  residents are so  high and the opportunities and resources so few.  Despite these  conditions and the  fact that women  continue to die and  go missing on a  regular basis, very  little attention is being paid to this situation by those in  positions to create  change. While our  primarily male leadership is negotiating  with the Canadian government over fishing rights, land claims, and self-governance, our mothers, aunts, sisters, and  daughters are dying on the streets, are disappearing or are being maimed.  Violence against Aboriginal prostitutes  is not an "Aboriginal issue" largely because  men are setting the agenda. While the other  issues are important to our survival and the  strength of our communities, the misogyny  which has been taught to us through colonization (and as a mechanism of colonization) is affecting more than just the organization of our band councils and male-  centered hierarchies. It is also allowing the  Elders open Valentines' Day March, February 14,1999 to commemorate the  women who have died violent deaths in the Downtown Eastside.  genocide of our sisters living and working  on the streets to continue without a national  uprising of our leadership.  Women's lives are being lost daily and  the stigma which surrounds the topic of  prostitution has shamed us into silence.  While efforts are being made to prevent  children from being victimized through  sexual exploitation, and sexual abuse cycles are beginning to be recognized and  slowly dealt with through addressing residential school abuse, grown women in  prostitution is still a taboo subject. Women's needs are being further marginalized  within our own marginalized communities.  In the eyes of many mainstream Canadians, the police, judges, and government  officials each have their role in ensuring the  safety of all members of Canadian society.  However, each of these groups has contributed to the marginalization and victimization of Aboriginal women, as they have  been entrusted with the tools of the  colonizers and the power to enforce our  oppressed position. They, like other members of Canadian society, have been indoctrinated with racist stereotypes about our  sexuality and our worth, and their work is  largely reflective of this ideology.  Police generally do very little to find  the murderers of women who are found  dead in areas like the Downtown Eastside.  One of every two murders of prostitutes in  Canada goes unsolved, as opposed to one  of five of all homicides. Police also have a  lot of room for enforcing laws as they see  fit, with the communication, bawdy house,  and procuring laws rarely being enforced  against Johns or pimps, and often being  used to harass prostitutes themselves.  For example, in a study conducted by  John Lowman of the SFU Criminology Department, police, apart from a handful of  charges, enforced the law only against prostitutes. The situation is changing slowly,  and more customers are being charged, but  the numbers are still not equal to sex workers.  The laws are biased against street  workers, and create situations in which it  is nearly impossible to work on the street  without harassment, but it is equally impossible for marginalized women—who  are not seen as "good" or "desirable"  enough—to work in safer off-street sex  work. Even though prostitution itself is not  illegal, sex workers are targeted under Canadian law, and are not protected from violence in the same way as other citizens and  workers.  This year, a $100,000 reward was offered in an attempt to locate some of the 31  reported missing sex trade workers from  the Downtown Eastside. Surprisingly, very  few of these 31 women are Aboriginal.  Where are the faces of our women? Why  has no one reported them missing?  One woman, Olivia Gale Williams,  went missing December 1996, and was not  reported missing until July 1997. How can  one of our women go missing and no one  takes notice? Our relations have become  invisible in the most impoverished, stigmatized community in Canada and even our  own family members are ashamed to speak  of the reality of their lives. We must begin  a dialogue around these issues and open  up the baggage and shame we carry around  about our own sexuality.  As we look forward to taking the necessary steps towards changing the situation  of violence and shame which is faced by  Aboriginal women working in the sex  trade, we must put the experiences and  needs of these women at the forefront. In  spite of the oppressive ideologies which  have been brought into our communities  through colonization, we need to focus on  the fact that our relations are dying and  disappearing on a regular basis from urban centers such as Vancouver.  We need to unlearn the moralistic, biased, racist and sexist beliefs which tell us  to be silent, and we must create movement  around these issues on all levels. There are  many areas in which change is needed, including service provision, law reformation,  education and alliance building.  see SEX TRADE page 24  DEC/JAN 2000 Confronting racism in anti-violence structures  A Good Burning Anger  by Wendy and Valerie as told to  Handan Acabay   Valerie Inglis is a First Nation, 2-  Spirit, Lesbian, Dyke, Butch/Fern,  Woman Loving Woman, Saphic Hedonist,  Queer who does not believe in labelling  herself. She currently works at Battered  Women's Support Services. Wendy works  in a feminist anti-violence organization  in Vancouver.  Handan is of Turkish, Kurdish and  German descent. She works in an autonomist shelter/crisis line in Giessen Germany. She is currently studying communications and languages in Marburg.  Handan loves life despite it all.  Handan is part of an anti-violence  project which was recently taken over by  a team composed exclusively of women-  of-colour. While shelters and transition  houses in many cities in Germany currently service predominantly migrant/  refugee and/or women-of-colour clients,  this reality is not reflected in the staff.  No more than a sprinkling of women-  of-colour work within most projects and  rarely in positions of power. Demands for  anti-oppression work and an affirmative  action policy have been met with outrage  so far, but efforts towards coordinating  women-of-colour from various projects in  Germany aim at breaking through their  isolation and creating a support-network.  Handan: I am interested in hearing  about your experiences. Do you encounter  racism in your interactions with group  members or clients? How do you feel you  are being treated? Do you feel you are taken  seriously? What kind of work do you do  within your structures?  Wendy: Those are huge questions.  Valerie: It also depends on what organization we are talking about and what their  policies are. Whether they have an affirmative action policy or not, et cetera. It is true  that if they do and you're the only one, you  tend to be tokenized. "See we're fine, we  have this colour, that colour and we're doing this."  It should be about actually walking  through anti-oppression work together. It's  not just about having this person or this culture represented in your group, it's how  you work through issues together. It takes  a lot of work, usually, on the person of colour's part. Where I work now is a bit different than where I've worked in the past  because we have actively worked towards  creating an anti-oppression place within the  organization. It wasn't always like that  though and I also have the experience of  functioning as a token.  Handan: Do you have discussions  about racism within the group?  Wendy: Actually, initially, my organization had created a watershed in terms of  its hiring policy which other organizations  now base their hiring policies on. This was  done quite a long time ago because women  of colour and First Nations women had  pushed for it until it was finally recognized.  It entailed hiring so many women of  colour, so many First Nations women, and  V<2 f-Cje l*/0./f/Q e \r  fer/fiqei   Buck f  making sure that there were provisions in  place ensuring that we represent the community that we are servicing. Predominantly, we service the Downtown Eastside  and we wanted that to be reflected in the  women that were hired.  Valerie: There's a huge difference between having a policy and a provision in  place and actually practicing it. I think  that's where we're sort of moving towards  in my organization. My position is actually  a very high profile position that two white  women occupied before I came on and my  co-partner is a white woman.  I deal with approximately seventy organizations, the justice system and women  serving organizations to help implement  the attorney general's policy on violence  against women in relationships, with different sub-committees and things like that.  Even after five months, almost everybody  has met me at least once, but I'm still astounded at the amount of people who don't  know how to treat me or be around me.  One of the things that we've had to  discuss is that I need allies and support  from my workplace because if I'm continually extending myself and calling people  on their stuff, then I'm perceived as a hysterical Indian. And if my co-partner whose  white, doesn't speak up even though she  hears it and sees it, then...  Wendy: It's legitimized.  Valerie: "A" legitimized and "B" she's  actually colluding with them by not speaking up with me. She, being white, would  legitimize calling somebody on their racist  statements or assumptions, but me, being  Native, even though I am calling people in  an intelligent, relatively articulate way,  placing it in front of them in a way that they  can understand and in their language because it's up to us to speak in their language  and in their discourse, whether it's legalese  or psychobabble, it's up to me to do that,  yet, again I will be perceived as being hysterical. Over and over and over again.  My actual workplace and environment  is supportive, but it's still work. One of my  co-workers likes to use the word loser, to  her that means nothing, but when she uses  it on me I have huge bells going off emotionally. Saying I'm a loser is saying I'm a  squaw, I'm a drunken Indian. She didn't  get that, we had to work through that a lot.  Fortunately, there was a wonderful article  in the Vancouver Sun about a 15-year old  Native girl who was fighting for her rights  and against experiences of overt racism.  She spoke about words and what they  mean to us. One of the words was "loser."  I brought the article into work and showed  it to my co-worker. That's when she got it.  It was no longer just one person who had a  problem with the word and did not want  to be called a "loser", not even in jest. So  again, it was a lot of work and it was work  on my part.  And then there are subtle things, the  acceptance of me because I fit in so welj  with intelligent, intellectual types. But  what's that saying about me or them? Native people aren't intelligent, so you're surprised how well I can articulate myself in  your language? Well, it takes a lot of work  for me to do this, but that's not saying anything about me, it's saying something about  you.  We have an anti-oppression policy that  we're all working really hard towards  walking: we're ninety percent women of  colour in all the coordinating positions and  all the different programs. We have a huge  volunteer base, which is actually predominantly white, so that makes it interesting.  Membership on the collective is about 50-  50 right now. I wonder, sometimes at night,  when I go home why I'm so exceptionally  tired. It's because the work I do is constant  and it's subtle and sometimes it's subconscious. Constantly educating or re-educating others about a simple word.  Wendy: Not only is anti-violence work  emotionally draining, but you also have  that constant battle and the juggling of how  to introduce these ideas around Native issues. For example, the importance of paying attention to Native issues. We are in the  Downtown Eastside, Native women are the  hardest hit by poverty and violence, the  degradation of many, many women's lives  down here is extreme and if we're not paying attention to this, then I don't know what  the hell we're doing. I'm always the only  one bringing these issues up and I never  have allies and it really is a struggle.  Valerie: It there's more than one of you  in an organization and one is political and  loud about it, which I am, but the other is  not because they're afraid, then divide and  conquer mechanisms kick in. It is not considered a big enough issue if you aren't allying together. So one of you comes off looking like this—and I put it in italics—hysterical person. They've done that, they've divided us.  A lot of Native women find it very hard  to push for that kind of change when  they're at a point where they might be feeling lucky they have a job there and they  have families to think about. As for me I  don't have anything to lose. I'm at a point  in my life where I don't care what I say, if  it's the bottom line truth and if it's the truth  of my experience and the Native women  who are coming to this organization for  service.  My bottom line is how do we serve  these women? Native women are coming  here on a regular basis and feel comfortable doing so, but will they still continue  to come if I or my other First Nations coworker aren't here?  Wendy: It is a structural problem. It  shouldn't be up to us to support Native  causes and Native women. You know, this  is Native land and it bothers me that colonialism is never a part of the equation. It  almost feels like if this work isn't being  done by me, it won't get done, it won't get  addressed and Native women are going to  stop using the service.  People lack education around it, they  lack understanding and there are so many  judgements being made all the time about  the Native women that are calling the line.  Or else it's "Wendy, you should talk to her  because she's Native." But no, you're on  the crisis line why are you coming to me  about this? Get educated, we do have workshops, we do have all of these things.  I try to talk about it all the time but I  really feel that I need allies. It really is a  matter of having allies and there are times  when it does go really well and I feel like  the dynamics are pretty good and people  are pretty respectful, but I still feel like I'm  doing all that work.  Valerie: And you shouldn't have to be.  I mean there are times when I get fed up  with having to be the one to educate. You  just get tired of it. But, then I thought about  it, actually an elder taught me: "Valerie if  you don't teach them the truth, they're going to go to the library or the internet or  see ANGER next page from ANGER previous page  somewhere and they're going to get the  archeological, anthropological view" which  is a white, male, conquering view of primitive heathens or primitive children, rather  than seeing us as human beings with a rich  history and culture.  Wendy: But in the end it tires you out.  One of my colleagues ended up in therapy  because she couldn't handle it anymore. In  the end you are the one who is doing the  giving and you get worn out.  Valerie: Or you start second guessing  yourself. What really pisses me off, on a  personal level is when I go home doubting  my experience whether it was viceral or  not. Covert racism isn't something that you  can attack, it just makes you feel like shit  and you're not sure why and you don't  have any armour to address it with that  person when you see them again. It just  made you feel like a piece of crap, that's  all.  Wendy: It's very dehumanizing. I come  from a really, really small Native village on  the coast. There is a lot of poverty and a lot  of despair and I see these beautiful Native  girls here in the Downtown Eastside and  they are disappearing at an alarming rate  and they are from places like Bella Coola  and Bella Bella.  I just think "Oh god if we're not here  for these people, if they can't call this crisis  line, if we can't help them and support  them in some way. I mean offer support in  the capacity that we can then, nobody's going to do it. It is a responsibility that then  becomes your personal responsibility. I  don't resent that because that is where my  heart and my passion is and where my  work calls me to be. But in terms of an organization, I do struggle with being the  only one to really care about these issues.  People will talk the talk, but it is harder to  walk the walk.  Valerie: The topic of anger also had to  be brought up at a staff meeting. How do  we facilitate the women that we deal with  as peer counsellors to express their anger  if we can't look at our own? We can't harbour it, so we need to express it in a way  that is not detrimental to ourselves or others. But first of all we need to acknowlege  that it's o.k. for women to have anger and  express it. Saying we are hysterical, if we  begin to express it, is just another way of  keeping us down.  Wendy: I think, if it's not acknowledged and it's not allowed to manifest itself in a way that's healthy before it just  explodes or sickens us, it implodes. This is  the big thing for me. I find that it will come  out in a really scathing way to people who  I am trying to educate and then I begin to  second guess myself and think, "Did I say  something wrong? Why did I get so upset?  Maybe I should have done it differently."  For me, anger is a big thing because I  think you can educate people in a more effective way if it isn't coming from such a  place of pain. It is almost invalidating the  cause that I am trying to bring up if I get so  angry that I am completely emotional about  it and people are so burned that people  don't even want to approach me. I'm really struggling with that right now. How  to acknowledge that anger without it coming out in ways that aren't really condusive  to good communication.  Valerie: But I don't think you should  have to be the one who's taking care of their  emotional response to truth.  Handan: They make you feel guilty.  Valerie: "See, if you hadn't spoken so  nastily to me I could have been an ally."  Again, it's all on our shoulders. I would  have been angry especially if they were  defensive. If they are not going to listen,  you bet, I'm going to get angrylAnd if  they're going to try and put it back on my  shoulders they're going to waste their time  because it is not my problem. If they are  not listening to me that's not my problem  but they're going to hear me and that's it.  What they do with that I have no control  over, but they're going to hear me and if I  have to be loud they're going to hear me.  It has taken me a long time. I know I  am way older than you, I hope it doesn't  take that long for you. I've been in anti-  violence work, semi-professionally, as they  say for 12 years. I've been a First Nations  women all my life and a lesbian to boot. So  my experiences run the gamut from being  on the streets as a kid to wherever I am now.  At times, I have been shut out and shut up  and invisible. How I got out of there to  where I am now, I have no idea. There was  a good burning anger in my gut telling me  this isn't right. It's injust.  And I know, I'm not the only  one experiencing it.  Wendy: For me, the impetus to get involved in this  kind of work was the experience of violence in my own  family. It was experienced  by my granny and then by  my mom, by all of mom's  siblings and by us while we  were growing up. I realised  that it's a condition that you  don't have to live with.  Violence is a condition  that you can be free of. In as  much as you create your  own personal kind of environment, it is not  something that you have to put up with.  It's not something that's o.k. I wanted to  find a way to combat it. That was the impetus for me getting involved in this work  but it really has been a struggle. I just find  it very isolating and I wish that there were  more people that were aware of these issues and how important they are.  Valerie: I agree. I also think that if we  are not working in non-Native organizations, then we are ghettoized in Native organizations which are again marginalised.  I use the word ghettoized because we are  easily discounted. You are just part of a Native organization. The approach to you is  different.  Again, working in a non-Native organization people are astounded and  stunned when they come face to face with  me after having dealt with me over the  phone. But at least where I am now, the  work I continue to do has a different tact.  Where I work now I wouldn't want to be  seen as a representative of Native women  and I don't ever speak as a representative  of Native women because we are too diverse. My experiences are mine. While they  do parallel many Native women's experience, it would be disrespectful to generalize.  Wendy: To have people think that you  are speaking for all of your people or for  all of your community is simply buying  into the stereotypes that white people have  about what it is to be an Indian or what it  is to be Native. That you must be speaking  for everyone is quite a racist assumption.  Regarding Native organizations, I attended the opening of the Squamish Nation Crisis Centre this summer. They are an  all Native anti-violence organization that  is just starting up. They want to start a  twenty -four hour crisis line for Native people on the North Shore. They have an art  therapist and there is a Native fellow who  has a psychiatric nursing background.  They're really organised. We were invited  out to the opening. It was beautiful, there  was dancing and singing and they brought  people through the centre and showed  them how it was going to work. They were  very together and had so much hope for  this centre. The community was in such  need of this and it just felt so good that I  didn't want to leave, (laughter) I just  thought "Ohhhh it would be so great to  work in a place like this and never have to  have those struggles." Then I thought, no I  think I would be struggling when it came  to women's issues. I don't think there is  any really ideal work place, but there is  definitely something to be said for a  workplace where people are more allied  with you when it comes to your political  views around race.  Valerie: You're right. When I worked  for a Native organization, if we experienced  any kind of racism out in any of the communities or at the workplace, we took it on  as a group, not one of us took it on personally.  For me, the impetus to get  involved in this kind of work  was the experience of  violence in my own family.  Where I am now, I feel targeted because  I don't have those kinds of allies. It is being  dumped on me and again that is more work  for me to do whether or not there is more  than one Native person working there. The  experience of myself and the other Native  woman worker there are different. Sometimes we can share experiences and other  times my reaction to my experience is  something she can't help me with. So who  do I go to? And again, am I second guessing myself or am I taking it too seriously?  Again, it is me thinking about how I'm supposed to fit into this. And there are no provisions in place. It's one thing to have a  policy. O.k. that's a start, but that's not the  end. How do you walk it? And how do you  as my ally walk it with me? That is the biggest struggle that I am finding right now.  And I don't know how to teach them. I 've  never really had people willing to be an ally  before, number one, and I don't know how  I want them to walk with me with the respect that I know would come from another  Native person.  Wendy: It takes a lot of work.  Handan: And it is so difficult if the  other Native women don't support you.  Valerie: It's this fear. There is a big fear.  Wendy: There is fear. I really want that  to be acknowledged. I think that the material circumstances of some women's lives  are such that they feel unsafe, and unwilling to come forward. They are afraid of being branded as these crazy Native women.  Handan: But would they have to fear  for their jobs? Don't you operate on consensus?  Valerie: Things can be made difficult  to the point where women would voluntarily leave.  Handan: So basically a hierarchy is still  in place in these structures.  Wendy: Yes. Collectivity is still a fantasy, (laughter)  Handan: But they claim...  Valerie: There is a claim but it's a fantasy. There's still a hierarchy whether its colour, whether it's privilege, or whether its  background.  Wendy: Functionally the collective isn't  this Utopian thing that everyone likes to say  it is or likes to think it is.  Handan: So the question is what do I  acheive by working in these groups?  Valerie: Exactly. What is the focus. One  of the things that we can't forget, and that I  don't forget—and I try to remind people  of—we're earning our daily bread off the  backs of beaten and raped women. If you  forget that focus then it's just a job, it's big  business now, battered women are big business. Transition houses are now unionized  and have standardized practices. If we forget the reasons we started these movements, then we're going to lose the whole  concept of collectivity, of why we're there,  why we still continue to do the work we  do. I don't imagine for a second that even  in my own lifetime that I will see dramatic  changes for First Nations people. I would  like to hope, but as a First  Nations woman I think  seven generations ahead of  me. It's the next generation,  their generation, the next,  the next, the next. So what I  start today, my self responsibility, has to reverberate  seven generations from me.  That is my responsibility.  Non-Native people don't  see that; they don't have that  to fall back on as their drive  and their passion.  Wendy: It's very ecological thinking. It's not just  thinking about the here and  now. I think that everything we do, every  interaction, everything we put in our  mouths, has a consequence on the planet,  and we have to be so aware of that. And  always be very aware of what you are doing the work for. And I've said that already.  And that is why I do it. It gives me the  chance to work with women that I love and  care about, who constantly amaze me with  how resourceful and smart and kind and  resilient they are. I'm just always blown  away by them, by their strength and by  their beauty. That is why I do the work, and  that is what makes it all worthwhile. All  the bullshit, I can deal with, if it's to be able  to do that, and to have an organization behind me so I can do those things. I can walk  around on the street. I can be my own personal activist, but it really does help to have  some organizational backing behind you,  to be able to do that kind of work. That's  why I do it. It is isolating and it is lonely,  but it's worth it. That's unfortunately how  I see it in terms of my organization and my  relationship to it. It's for the women, not  for the kind of feel-good sense of community I might get out of being there.  Valerie: And not to grandize the organization either, or their political statement or  anything like that for me either. I am astounded and amazed by the resilience of  Native women, what we have lived  through generation after generation, and  the strength and power in each individual  woman. It's amazing, and that's what keeps  me going too. I wouldn't be still doing this  work after 12 years if I didn't have that to  sustain me.  ATTENTION!!!  Aboriginal Women of All Nations!  \ The 4th BC Conference  I on Aboriginal Women and Wellness  7 THE LEGACIES WE LEAVE OUR CHILDREN  January 8-11,2000  Vancouver, British Columbia  For further information,  Call: (604) 822-4965  >r Fax (604) 822-4835  >r E-mail elaine@cchs.ubcc;  ; WOMEN'S  DEC/JAN 2000  KINESIS from SEX TRADE page 21  The services that exist now are largely  directed toward helping women exit the sex  trade. Many women can only find help if  they are willing to become "good," moral  citizens. More services must be made available to women who are in situations of violence, need help with substance abuse,  dealing with police or the law,  health issues,  housing, familial  issues, and other  problems, regardless of how  they are making  money to feed  their families and  themselves.  Aboriginal  women should  have the option  of using services  which are specifically designed to  meet the needs of  Aboriginal  women, using  culturally-appropriate programs.  The programs  should ideally be  run by former  sex trade workers, to ensure that  the people who  are running the  programs have  experiential  knowledge of  facing the dangers of working in prostitution, dealing  with the police, and living with the 'whore'  stigma on a daily basis.  Additionally, programs need to be established in non-urban Aboriginal communities to address the reasons why women  flee these communities and migrate to urban areas to work in the very dangerous  street-level sex trade. It is necessary to establish programs designed to support  women who have experienced sexual or  physical abuse, who are in violent relationships, need help with employment, skill development, substance abuse, health issues,  and the many other conditions of colonization, in order to prevent women from  ending up with no choice but to leave their  homes and work as prostitutes in the city.  It is necessary for Aboriginal women  to have more options available to them, and  to be supported in their communities to  prevent them from becoming isolated in  urban centres, working under very dangerous conditions. The prostitution laws which  currently exist in Canada only serve to  make problems worse for sex trade workers, especially street workers, and are in  need of some serious reformation.  John Lowman has the following suggestion for change: " As long as prostitution is legal—and there is every reason to  believe that criminalization would only  make matters worse—Canadian politicians  ought to decide where and under what circumstances prostitutes can meet their customers."  By changing the laws to reflect the fact  that sex work is indeed legal, we can focus  on situations of abuse or misuse of power,  and sex workers can finally have the same  rights as any other worker, as any other  human being. We must strive to make it  easier to prosecute abusers and leave those  women in consensual situations alone.  We need to  work to ensure  that sex trade  workers can  maintain a sense  of dignity and  that their lives  are valued  as much as  any other  woman on  this earth.  Women must ultimately have control over  what they do with their bodies, and how  they use them to make money—whether  they be using their hands, eyes, minds,  mouths, or vaginas.  Education must happen on all levels,  including with the public and with those  people whose voices are heard in our communities, includingAboriginal leaders. We  must break down  the virgin-whore  dichotomy, refusing to be pitted  against each  other. Solidarity  work between  women working  in the sex trade  and women not  working in the  trade is crucial,  and is a revolutionary act in and  of itself.  Aboriginal  leaders must also  make the concerns of the  women in our  communities a  priority, to ensure  that women are  not forced into  prostitution as a  result of being  chased off reserves by situations of abuse. We  must be able to  talk openly about  prostitution, recognizing the large  numbers of Aboriginal women who are  working on the streets, and we must make  it our concern, honouring the women who  fight for their lives every day.  Large numbers of Aboriginal women  will continue to choose to work in the sex  trade, until Aboriginal communities make  substantial jumps in their path toward healing and putting back together the fragments  of our communities which have been blown  apart by the forces of colonization. Aboriginal women residing in urban areas need  activism around obliterating poverty,  sexual abuse, child abuse, violence, and  other forms of continuing the legacy of  colonization.  Ideally, Aboriginal women should not  have to go into prostitution out of a place  of desperation. But until those forces which  shape our lives, whether in the city or on  the reserve, are themselves abolished, sex  work will continue to be a reality for  women in our community.  We need to work to ensure that sex  trade workers can maintain a sense of dignity and that their lives are valued as much  as any other woman on this earth.  We need to ensure that sex trade workers have access to services if they have been  raped or physically beaten, if they have  been robbed or kicked out of their homes,  and if they still see prostitution as the best  way to make their living.  We need to work to create options for  Aboriginal women so that they can choose  to make a living for themselves and their  families in other ways if they desire to do  Sarah Hunt is a mixed-blood woman from the  Kwagulth Band of the Kwakwaka' wakw Nation.

DEC/JAN 2000 Filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin:  25 years in the making  by Abby Cote  Alanis Obomsawin is a member of the  Abenaki First Nation from the Odanak reserve in Quebec. A proud Anishinabekwe  (Aboriginal woman in the Algonkian dialect) she has dedicated her life to making  films that focus on Native peoples, their  cultures and issues.  Obomsawin's career in filmmaking  was showcased in the Retrospective of  Native Filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin's 25-  Year Career at the Reel Aboriginal Film Series that ran throughout the six-day Aboriginal Voices Festival in Toronto in June of  this year. The event included rare screenings, film discussions and premises of some  of the director's work. Obomsawin was on  hand during the Festival.  Obomsawin  is a board member with the  newly developed APTN (the  Aboriginal Peoples Television  Network), a national television  station that went  on air across  Canada on September 1st, 1999  as part of basic  cable packages.  She has also  been involved  for years as a  member of the  Board of Directors of the National Film  Board of Canada  which also  sponsors the  making of her  films.  Obomsawin  is "well versed  in Mohawk history", having made several films that focus on Mohawk history. Among these are,  My Name Is Kahentiiosta (Behind the Scenes  of the Kanehsatake Crisis) and her most recently released film, titled, Spudwrench  about one of the warriors who was at  Kanehsatake who is also an iron worker.  Spudwrench premiered in Brittany in late  1997 and was aired this past summer in Toronto at The Aboriginal Voices Festival.  Obomsawin has also documented  some of her many travels to the James Bay  region of Canada which she has presented  as a slide show, titled The Travels of Alanis.  This slide show was filmed in Moose Factory and Alanis considers it "a children's  film and the backbone of her film, Christmas in Moose Factory."  During the slide presentation of The  Travels of Alanis, Obomsawin provides the  audio commentary, making reference to the  wrongs done to Aboriginal people as a result of residential schools. The period of  time during which Obomsawin was making this slide show, 1966 through to 1968,  "was the tail end of the residential school  system and the eight or so former residen-  The Canadian  government  setting up the  reservation  system and  placing Native  people on those  reservations was  all about the  possession of  tial schools had been converted into residences for children who for the most part  lived at and were attending school in  Moose Factory."  Obomsawin feels that her visits to  Moose Factory influenced further film making in the north. "It was difficult being both  a woman and a Native when I started working to bring the plight of children to the  forefront more than thirty-six years ago, but  I feel that I helped to pave the way for the  Native filmmakers of today."  Obomsawin was fortunate to be able  to document the events at Oka on film, thus  allowing the rest of Canada and the world  to view the happenings there, however  making the films was an extremely challenging process.  "In July of  1990 the police  blockaded the village and journalists were given  special accreditation. At that time I  had two crews  with me and one  time the crews  were allowed in  but I was not. I  ended up staying  there instead of  trying to go home  to sleep. The outcome of this situation gave me further insight into  some of the repercussions of the police blockade.  "I spent time  talking with some  of the police officers and arm)' personnel and they  were just like people everywhere,  some were real  bullies and used their power on the people  and some were just doing their job and may  not have wanted to be there anymore than  we did.  "It was quite a schooling for me. I was  worried about whether my equipment  would be confiscated. I finally came out in  October of 1990.1 felt as though I'd gained  ten years and three months during the occupation."  Commenting on the political state of  things in Oka all these years later,  Obomsawin says, "There are still problems  in the State of Oka, still a lot of problems.  Although the golf course expansion and the  building of the condominiums were  stopped, some of the underlying issues still  remain."  "The Canadian government setting up  the reservation system and placing Native  people on those reservations was all about  the possession of land. Oka may have occurred in 1990, but the issues behind the  occupation have been going on for generations and could be considered the basis for  Native land issues across this country. The  reason that Oka brought the issue to the  forefront was  because it  was all so  highly publicised and because the  army was  brought in,  therefore,  making it the  most publicised Native  occupation  in Canada up  until that  point."  H o w -  ever, Oka  changed all  of that, now  maybe the  country is  more aware  of the significance and  outcome of  Native blockades and oc-  cupations.  Aboriginal  people  learned some  valuable lessons from  Oka about effective and in  effective media coverage.  We are now trying to ensure that our side  is effectively heard and seen. By utilizing  Native press coverage and by having Native producers and directors like  Obomsawin present, our side of the land  issue is being more fairly represented to the  rest of the world.  Obomsawin has been directing films  about Canadian Aboriginal history for  more than 25 years now.  "I am happy to be able to make these  documentaries that are seen all over the  world, I am happy about that for future  generations. The next seven generations  need to be taught the ways of our people.  It is the responsibility of all of us to care for  this world. The youth of today are the future leaders, so we need to show them by  example to do something good for our  country."  Aside from making films, Obomsawin  is an accomplished writer. She has done  many presentations of her written work  including reading her poems and singing  songs she has written while accompanying  herself on her hand drum. During her presentations she reminds us that, "The rule of  law in this country is to suppress our rights.  We need to find our way back from the road  of broken dreams, and the way to do that  is to listen to the spirit within ourselves."  Obomsawin stated, "I've never actually said this before, but I encourage all Native people to find a way to document their  local, community histories to enrich our  young people. Through educating our  young people of today with our own teach-  Image from Kanehsatake: 270Years of Resistance  ings we are building stronger communities  for tomorrow. I support and encourage the  video and tape recording of our Elders so  that we have access to their knowledge. I  believe that we are gaining control over  how our histories and teachings are being  recorded and this is no longer done in a  disrespectful and exploitative way. Now we  have the tools to record our histories in a  good way and to utilize them for the good  of our communities."  Obomsawin is always busy writing or  working on a current film project. She is  also the author of numerous poems and  songs and has a cassette tape available that  was produced in 1988 titled, Bush Lady.  Many of Obomsawin's films are available  at public libraries across Canada. For more  information or to purchase her work contact the National Film Board of Canada.  Obomsawin is well known internationally as a producer, director, writer, singer  and songwriter. She has toured Canada, the  United States and Europe as a singer,  teacher, speaker and film maker and intends to "keep on making films that speak  out about Native heritage, culture and issues as long as there are films to be made".

The speaker is Attakullakulla, a  Cherokee Chief renowned for his shrewd  and effective diplomacy. He has come to  negotiate a treaty with the whites. Among  his delegation are women "as famous in  war, as powerful in the council."  Implicit in the Chief's question,  "Where are your women?" the Cherokee  hear, "Where is your balance? What is  your intent?"They see balance is absent  and are wary of the white man's motives.  They intuit the mentality of destruction.  "I turn to my own time. I look at the  Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission... to the hierarchies   of   my  church, my university, my  city, my  children's school.  "Where  are  your  women?" I ask.

Native women    were not tradition-  c£ ally excluded from decision making, as has  been the case for women in western politics. Native women had political authority  because our nations recognized the value  of having input from all members of society.  The inclusion of women in decisions  was critical for the security of the nation.  Like her Cherokee ancestors, Awiakta  points to the mentality of destruction,  which sees nothing wrong with excluding  50 percent of the population from positions  that are politically powerful within the nation, the community, the church, and  school.  There are a number of ways that our  women traditionally exercised political  power. Any one of our Iroquois sisters and  brothers can attest to the fact that their  women had (and still have, albeit to a much  lesser degree) political power, and there are  a number of written works that confirm  this.2  Iroquois women had a role as leaders  vis-a-vis the outside world, as is evident in  their role in negotiating some treaties.3 In  traditional Iroquois systems of governance,  women's political authority extended to  choosing and deposing the chiefs.4  Chieftainships were determined and managed by matrons of certain families who  held meetings with other clan women to  make these decisions. Iroquois women also  exercised their political authority through  participation in community meetings.  "[Iroquois] women often addressed  councils; their opinion was asked and  places in council  and to guide  the men..."  heeded. When tribal or village decisions  had to be made, both men and women attended a meeting. Though the chiefs normally did the public speaking, women at  times stepped up and, by their authority  as owners of the land and their concern for  the future of their children, took an active  part in telling sachems (chiefs) what they  should do."5  The Mohawks also had a women's  council that would bring their issues to the  Grand Council or to all of the people, if  necessary. According to Sylvia Maracle, a  women's council still operates. It travels  between various Mohawk communities to  hold public meetings. Although these  women may have some influence on the  modern-day political system, they no  longer hold the official status or authority  they did before the introduction of an  elected chief and council.  Other Native  societies had similar political systems that ensured  the participation  and influence of  women. Sto:lo  Elder Dorris Peters  recalls her grandmother telling her  "women were able  to choose the  chiefs, and women  were able to fire the  chiefs." Like the  Iroquois, the  Cherokee had  women's councils  whereby women had direct input into political decisions.6  Some nations had Elders' councils that  were comprised of men and women.  Simona Arnatsiaq, co-ordinator of the  Women's Program for the Qiqiktani Inuit  Association, points out that traditional Inuit  politics were dealt with by both female and  male Elders who would discuss and decide  matters pertaining to the community. She  confirmed that informal leadership of this  nature is still operating in many Inuit communities today.  Monica Ittusardjuat is an Inuk currently living in Iqaluit, Nunavut. She describes how women were generally called  upon to deal with matters related to community harmony and wellness, but qualifies, "there was no rule that said it had to  be a woman. It was according to ability and  what people did."  Some societies had both male and female chiefs. Wet'suwet'en chieftainships,  which are still in place today, are hereditary. Leadership positions can fall on a male  or a female child, and everyone takes direction from the wisest and the eldest (male  or female) chief. In Plateau societies, both  women and men filled the role of chief. The  wives of male chiefs also served as advisors, or as chiefs in the case of a husband's  absence or death.7 The Algonkian and the  Sioux had similar practices.8  see ANDERSON page 27  kSJSi  IS  DEC/JAN 2000 SNEAK PREVIEW  from ANDERSON page 26  If formal political systems did not include women's voices, then women found  the authority to voice their opinions  through the influence they exercised over  their male partners. This type of indirect  evidence has been noted among the  Blackfoot and the Sioux.9  Be-te Paul points out that in Maliseet  society, "The elder women were the ones  to hold places in council and to guide the  men.. .We had chiefs, but the elder women  were behind the men; they were listened  to and held in high respect."10  Inuit women also influenced politics  by stating their opinions to their husbands.  These opinions were taken seriously, as they  were a way of accessing the collective opinion of the women of the community. In  public gatherings, older women were likely  to voice opinions about policy decisions.  Their status as Elders secured their authority, as it still does today: "Position in the  age hierarchy protects old women from recrimination and retaliation so that they are  in a position to insinuate the 'women's vote'  into what would otherwise be an all-male  'caucus'."11  It may seem incredible that this territory we know as Canada once hosted societies that afforded significant political  power to those currently most  marginalized: older women. Yet in "Indian  country," the political authority of older  women is not so far in the past. Many contemporary women can describe the political authority their grandmothers held in  their families and societies, even after the  introduction of western political systems.  Jeannette Armstrong (Okanagan) recalls how, "it was traditionally always  women who made decisions about re-  who made decisions about the wealth, and  who carefully constructed a balance of  power in the family, and a balance of work  and task making and so on." Armstrong  grew up in a family where her grandmother  played the role of decision-maker. Maria  Campbell's great-grandmother held a similar role. Campbell points out that the authority of her grandmother was based on  her relationship to the children.  "My great-grandmother was the head  of our family. No decision was made without her first giving her blessing. My uncles  would sit down and talk to her when they  were going to do something. If she said no,  nobody questioned it. She would tell them  why, and they trusted her, because her primary responsibility to the community was  to the children. Her decisions were based  completely on the children. They didn't  question that."  It becomes clear when we listen to  these women that their societies understood the significant roles, responsibilities  and skills involved in being the primary  caregivers of children. Their societies upheld the people who held these roles and  gave them the power to make decisions  about their families, communities and nations.  In spite of the fact that many families  and societies held on to traditional female  political authority, Native women on the  whole experienced a tremendous loss with  the introduction of European political systems. The severest blow to their status came  with the introduction of the Indian Act in  1876, which defined who was an Indian  and what Indians could and could not do.  The Act legally took away long-established  rights for Native women, and left them  with fewer rights than Indian men.  Native women were categorically denied the right to vote in band elections.  They could not hold political office, nor  could they speak at public meetings.12 The  Act also prevented Native women from  voting on issues of band territory. It was  not until the 1950s that Native women regained the right to participate in these public and political affairs.13 Revisions to the  Indian Act gave status Indian women the  right to vote in band  elections, but they  were not permitted  to vote in provincial  or federal elections  in Canada until the  1960s.  The Indian Act  not only dispossessed women of  community/communal authority, it  severely dismantled  their authority  within the family  through the imposition of patriarchal  marriage and property rights. The Act  decreed that Native  women who married non-Native men  lost their status, and  that Native women  who married Native  men from other  bands lost their  rights in their home communities.  Kathleen Jamieson, who has written  extensively about the losses Native women  experienced, wrote the following passage  in 1978. In it she points to the inequities that  time.  "The woman, on marriage, must leave  her parents'home and her reserve. She may  not own property on the reserve and must  dispose of any property she does hold. She  may be prevented from inheriting property  left to her by her parents. She cannot take  any further part in band business. Her children are not recognized as Indian and are  therefore denied access to cultural and social amenities of the Indian community.  And, most punitive of all, she may be prevented from returning to live with her family on the reserve, even if she is in dire need,  very ill, a widow, divorced or separated.  Finally, her body may not be buried on the  reserve with those of her forebears."14  These laws were not repealed until  1985. For over a century, Native women  were shut out of their communities and  families. Women who kept their status were  shut out of political and economic decisionmaking because they were restricted from  owning property. Even on the death of their  husbands, they had no inheritance rights:  "On the death of an Indian, his 'goods and  chattels' and land rights were to be passed  to his children. The wife was excluded, her  maintenance being the responsibility of the  children."15  Cathy Martin, a Mi'kmaq from Nova  Scotia, points out that the removal of  women from the political process was part  of a deliberate dismantling of the culture  overall. When the colonizers came, she  says, "they saw a society where women  were respected and children were respected, and this was very much against  the colonialist or the patriarchal world that  they came from." The Indian Act banished  Native women who married white men,  while at the same time awarding Indian  "In order to  break down and  destroy a  culture, you  have to get to  the root of it  The heart of  Aboriginal  cultures is the  women "  status to white women who married Native men. Martin comments on how this  may have been part of an assimilation strategy  "In order to break down and destroy a  culture, you have to get to the root of it.  The heart of Aboriginal cultures is the  women. So it makes sense to start making  policies that would banish the women, the  givers of the language, the culture, and life.  The ones who  brought in the Native children and  made them Native.  It made sense to  make that policy so  that white women  could come in and  take over that role  and start teaching  the white ways."  Whatever the  intent, the patriarchal provisions of  the Indian Act removed Native  women from their  roles as decisionmakers and teachers, and robbed  them of their voice  in community affairs. Once active  participants in the  management of  community affairs,  they were forced  into positions that held little power.  This deliberate state action imposed on  Native women the devalued position of  women in western society. White women  had no power to vote, they did not hold  in decision-making on matters ranging  from the family, to community, to nation.  Native women who held political power  were a threat to this kind of a system. They  could effectively be put in their place  through assimilation, or by making them  the same as white women, as Janice Acoose  explains.  "Indigenous women's political powers  (including and especially the freedom to exercise control over their bodies and relations with others) were almost completely  eradicated while their energies were  channeled into less threatening activities,  such as ladies'auxiliary groups, church rituals (marriage, baptism, confession, communion, confirmations and funerals), as  well as far less important social activities  such as church sponsored teas, bake sales  and bazaars."16  For the first time in our history, our  women found themselves on the margins,  in the ghettoes of the evolving culture. The  exclusion of our women from decisionmaking in important political and community matters not only disempowered the  women, it also disempowered Indigenous  cultures.  1 Marilou Awiakta, Selu: Seeking the  Corn Mother's Wisdom (Golden, CO: Fulcrum Publishing, 1993), 9.  2 See W G.

T'lina: The  Rendering of  Wealth won  the best short documentary award this year  at the American Indian Film Festival in San  Francisco. Each of the three films she has  submitted to the film festival over the last  four years has earned her the best documentary award.  Since its sold out world premiere at the  Vancouver International Film Festival, the  film has gained much attention for its con  tribution to raising the public consciousness  about First Nations' modern day issues.  T'lina: The Rendering of Wealth highlights the importance of recognizing and  celebrating traditional activities, regardless  of how few people possess the knowledge  or practice them in their communities.  The significance of this film was indicated by the attendance of 50 or so members of her home community of Alert Bay,  who travelled to Vancouver to attend the  premier. Not only did they show their support by attending, they also sang feast songs  with her after the audience had a first hand  chance to taste the precious t'lina (pronounced gleet-na) that was offered along  with other food after the screening.  This act of celebrating in a traditional  manner while in a modern setting is indicative of the film itself. The balancing of cultures is played out as Cranmer smoothly  works the archival clips of her people celebrating the production of t'lina and the  voice of her deceased grandfather into this  modern day way of recounting our history.  Although Cranmer uses modern technology to document our histories, she honours  the importance of continuing in our oral  traditions by letting the voices of the people who know our truths be heard.  T'lina is commonly thought of as just  a traditional food staple, but Cranmer  shares with us the many issues that are  raised when speaking of t'lina. These include the traditional grease trails used for  trading, its importance in the potlatch system, the rituals that are practised when  gathering and processing the eulachons  (the fish from which t'lina is extracted), the  destruction of the environment that is causing the stocks to dwindle, and the importance of passing on the knowledge to  younger generations so that this age old  practice will not be forgotten.  One of the most important points of  the film is that the gathering of eulachons  and the continuation of producing t'lina is  being threatened not only by the destructive logging practices in the region, but also  by the loss of knowledge of our people. But  the young faces of those in the film who  are pulling in the nets, standing under the  falls, tending to the simmering fish, gathering the cedar bark, and celebrating in the  Bighouse along with the Elders gives us  hope that this irreplaceable aspect of the  culture will be carried on as long as there  are still fish to catch.  Currently, Cranmer is working on  I'tusto: To Rise Again which documents the  rebuilding of the Bighouse in Alert Bay ,  destroyed by an act of arson in August of  1997, as well as We Weave Our History  which tells the stories of six weavers working to bring traditional chilkat and geometrical weaving back to coastal First Nations communities.

Her docu-drama is a personal account of the coming-of-age and  political development of young radical  Native women in the late 1960s and early  70s.  Reece takes viewers back to when she  came to Vancouver following the death of  her 18-year old brother. They were the children of a Cree family from Alberta who  were placed in foster care. In her search for  identity, Reece found the Native Alliance  for Red Power (NARP).  There, she met other 'red power  women,' three of whom she interviews for  her video: Ginger Adams, Joan Phillip and  Lee Maracle. These women relate the events  which led to their politicization and their  experiences in the growing Red Power  movement of this time.  Ginger Ambers goes back to her time  at a residential school. She talks about how  the resistance she was involved in then, laid  the groundwork for her later political work.  When older siblings learned that many of  the young boys staying at the school were  being sexually abused, they organized a petition expressing their anger and demanding to speak with the administration.  Although, they were initially refused  a meeting, the students' resolve was so  great that the staff soon initiated a reform:  new supervisors were hired for the younger  boys and powdered milk was replaced with  fresh milk. This was Amber's first lesson  in political organization and it taught her  that "When people come together, they can  make change!"  NARP was borne out of this self-empowerment and resistance. The trigger behind the group's first meeting was the  murder of a Native woman in Williams  Lake, BC. She was tortured to death, then  thrown in the garbage. For this crime, only  one of the two men responsible was fined—  $200: the equivalent to hunting moose out  of season. The other man was acquitted.  In developing their analysis, members  of NARP drew on the influence of the civil  rights movement in the United States and  from the writings of revolutionary thinkers such as Lenin, Mao Tse-tung and Frantz  Fanon. A study group about colonization  was set up to help the activists develop their  politics and their radicalism. With the help  of a dictionary, even those with a Grade 4  reading level could make it through the lessons of these legends of revolution.  An important aspect of the struggle for  members of NARP was the cultural importance of language and tradition. Internalized racism was responsible for the deep  sense of shame that many Native people  felt with respect to their identity, but a shift  in the way the movement saw itself had  begun.  Travelling south of the border in support of a struggle around fishing rights—  which drew tribes from all over Turtle Island—NARP members were, for the first  time, exposed to a traditionalist path. People began to identify with their ancestors  and to be proud of who they were. They  realized they had much to heal from, and  that 'the hangover of racism'—violence and  addictions—was at the source of much of  their pain.  The women in NARP had to stand together and fight for their place beside the  men. As women, they developed a sense  of togetherness, and over time, love for each  other as brother and sister as they grew in  the struggle for sovreignty.  Lee Maracle characterizes the first few  years of NARP as a journey of discovery—  of self, of activism, and of community. The  goal, she says, is to develop the power  within and to engage in the decolonizing  work which will lead to a culture of healing. To do that, Maracle adds, it is critical  that Native peoples regain their land base.  Some of the younger women who  speak towards the end of the film underline the importance of spirituality. They  believe their mothers and grandmothers  have uncovered the truths. It is important  to tap into this but now, they feel, it is time  to move to the source and begin healing on  a deeper more spiritual level.  Skeena Reece, Cleo's daughter, is  shown speaking at a demonstration in November 1997, when leaders of 19 nations  converged on Vancouver for the Leader's  Summit of APEC (the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation). She states that the  likes of APEC are not new to Native people who have lived with genocide for so  long.  She adds that, "the Creator put us here  for a reason—to make a stand for the air,  water and land—not just for our own children, but for all humankind."  Reece's film spans the past, present and  future. She was inspired by many women,  and she thanks those who came before and  those who will come after.

The event at the  Vogue Theatre (918 Granville St.) will be one of the  highlights of the first Black History Month of the new  millennium.  Davis gained international attention in 1969 for her  membership in the U.S. Communist Party and for her  activism in the civil rights movement. In 1970 she was  placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and was  eventually incarcerated for eighteen months on false  charges. A massive international "Free Angela Davis"  campaign led to her acquittal in 1972.  During the last 25 years, Davis has been active as a  student, teacher, writer and continues to be an outspoken activist and organizer on issues of race, gender and class.
