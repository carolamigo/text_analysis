No, really. It  was all this stuff Kim Campbell was saying to the mainstream press. We promised ourselves  we wouldn't take pot-shots at her but how can we resist when she says she's smoked pot but  has never been in possession of it so it's not a crime. Our "admiration" for her grew by leaps  and bounds...her logic was brilliant; simple but brilliant! See, if she smoked the joint but  never really possessed it, we are left wondering if: a) it possessed her; b) she stole it c) she  got someone to hold the joint to her mouth and never touched it and d) someone could have  shotgunned it (that's when someone blows smoke into your mouth, not something to do with  military helicopters) and e) what' she gonna say if she ever becomes prime minister? We're  laughing...but we're far from happy. We think she's dangerous and...as Judy Rebick tells  Kinesis in the interview we did with her [see page 10], the Kim Campbells of the world play  into a strategy the right is using to marginalize feminists at the grassroots by setting up  women like Kimmie as The Feminist Voice for women. It's a new way of marginalizing us  in our struggle against some very real issues.  Speaking of Rebick, NAC's Sunera Thobani flew down to Winnipeg for a conference  for women working on health issues called the women's Interaction conference...the 60  women who attended discussed setting up a national women's health network, she tells us.  Sounds great but it's still in the works. The only thing really decided on so far is there is going  to be a national network.  Speaking of Thobani and health issues, (gosh, everything's related to something, ain't  that strange?) remember the infamous Dr. Stephens from Seattle who targeted the South  Asian community in Vancouver for pre-birth sex-selection services last year and the  demonstrations and activism to stop him—Thobani was one of the women who organized  in Vancouver...together with women from SAWAN (South Asian Women's Action Network), India Mahila Association and Vancouver's New Reproductive Technologies Coalition—well, Stephens is still at it and SAWAN and India Manila have started a letter-writing  campaign to stop his sexist, racist ads from being published in the Vancouver community  newspapers, The Link, and The Indo-Canadian Voice. If you'd like to support this campaign, send  your letters of protest to The Link (fax 876-8500, tel 876-9300) and The Indo-Canadian Voice (fax  321-4136, tel 321-4122). Call Chris at 255-5511 for details.  More on NAC: following the article we ran in the last issue on Thobani—she's the new  president of NAC, right., oh, and she told us she first heard about NAC in Kinesis—and  following the mainstream press' coverage of the attack on her on the floor of the House of  Commons for being an "illegal immigrant" (therefore unfit as president) we had a ton of  (racist) calls a t Kinesis com plaining about her appointment. And not just Kinesis... Rebick tells  us it's the same at NAC in Toronto: "people seem to have this idea NAC's a political party  or a government. We're getting calls from people saying: T am a tax payer and I want to  choose the president of NAC." Bizarre! Rebick says the same thing happened last year  during the referendum on theconsti national amendments when "the media treated NAC like  a political party and we kept saying: 'But we're a social movement, not a political party'."  Speaking of parties and social movements..100,000 enemies of Kim's Canada showed  up for a helluva party up on Parliament Hill on May 15 against the petTory project, the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) [see our story on page 12],...sometimes we have  a hard time remembering NAFTA is more than just a nifty acronym—it stands for increased  and, we believe, irreversible erosion of women's rights and equality in so many, many areas,  it's mind-boggling.  Oh, we read somewhere that Rosemary Brown (Ex- of the Vancouver Status of Women,  very many many years ago) may be the new chair of the Ontario Human Rights Commission.  We don't always agree with Brown but we'll miss her column in The Vancouver Sun.  Speaking of which, The Sun seems to have become BC's retirement home for disgruntled-  SocCreds-with-nothing-nastier-to-do. It's steadily becoming more right-wing and nasty  daily.  Speaking of nasty, we heard things got out of hand at the BC and Yukon Association  of Women's Centres annual general meeting and conference last month... in fact, some  representatives from women's centres across the province spent all weekend searching the  Parkhill Hotel in Vancouver for the lost AGM and never found it...we'll have more on The  AGM That Wasn't nextissue...whatwe have heard is that the futureofBC&Yisuncertain...and  there may even be a walkout by some of the more progressive women's groups in the  provincial scene...  Which doesn't mean good things aren't happening in the BC's women's  movement...there's a lot of work being done out there...and a lot of debate happening.  Kinesis was deluged with stories on a number of topics...Many of the stories didn't pan out  because everyone was just so busy doing a million other things at the same time. One hot topic  that women seem to be talking about a lot these days is pornography, the Butler decision  and lesbian erotica. We'll have a special spread on that next month.  We had phone calls last week telling us: about the India Mahila Association's plans to  hold a conference to discuss the recent needs assessment they did on how violence affects  South Asian women; about the soon-to-be-released annual report by NAC (almost everything you've ever wanted to know where women stand economically and otherwise.. .lots of  stats, if you like that kind of thing); about the first conference for women of colour on how  to build on a woman-of-colour movement in BC to be held in Vancouver; to check out  Sexuality and the Family, a group exhibition by seven women of colour, curated by Larissa  Lai [see page 21 for details]; and a whole bunch of calls about performances and demos and  meetings and conferences [see Bulletin Board]...so much happening, so little time...  ...speaking of which, we're out of time...for now.  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

Call 255-5499  It's summer in the city, and we've been  working here all weekend, enviously looking out at people on Commercial drive enjoying the sunshine. But we still had fun  putting together this issue, and we've got  lots of stuff to say about the people who  volunteered.  We had several new writers this issue:  Janet Brook and Juliet O'Keefe rave about  the new production of the Camelot legends.  Gwen Basen, co-chair of NAC's new reproductive technologies committee has the story  of where the Royal Commission on new  reproductive technologies' fertility report  should be filed. Tanis Doe and Fawzia  Ahmad, volunteers at WAVAW, report on  access for deaf and hard-of-hearing women.  Johannah Pilot looks at the BC NDP government's new anti-violence initiative. And  Naomi Ehren-Lis reviews Half a Kingdom:  Seven Jewish Feminists.  We've also worked with three new production volunteers. Irene Neufeld and Nancy  Vibert did an excellent job of proofreading,  and dare you to find any typos in this issue.  Both Nancy and Wendy Frost edited and  proofread all weekend long—a marathon  session! (We don't expect all our volunteers  to do this, by the way.)  The editorial board has been working  hard to bring you one helluva Kinesis Benefit, which takes place on Wedneday, June  16, at 7:30 pm at the WISE Hall, 1882 Adanac  at Victoria between Hastings and Venables.  Performers include the Kiss & Tell Collective; cub, an alternative rock band; Sook-Yin  Lee; and our own Kathy March and Miche  Hill, a dynamite singing and guitar playing  combo.  We guarantee that a good time will be  had by all. All women and children are  welcome; there will be childcare at the benefit and a child care subsidy is also available.  Admission is S3-S8 on a sliding scale.  We're also selling raffle tickets for the  benefit. Prizes include a course (value to  $500) from the Simon Fraser University  Writing and Publishing Program; a weekend for two at the Parkhill Hotel on Davie  Street in Vancouver (value approximately  $150); original artwork from Sunnybrook by  Persimmon Blackbridge [see our review, Apr.  92;] and many, many, many more. Drop by  our office at 301-1720 Grant, just off Commercial in Vancouver or call 255-5499 if  you'd like to support us by buying a ticket  or, even better, sell them for us!  We also have tons of books and gift  certificates as door prizes, donated by Octopus, Book Mantel, People's Co-op, R2B2,  Spartacus, Women's Bookstore, Ariel, and  Li ttle Sister's Bookstore, and other stuff from  Women's Work, Aritzia,Highlife... You have  to show up to win these! We also need  volunteers to help with the door, food, and  childcare at the benefit. This is a good way to  get in for free.  As always, we also need volunteers for  Kinesis. Writers are welcomed with open  arms at our writers' meetings, no experience  necessary. The next one is on Tuesday, June  1 at 7 pm; call Fatima at 255-5499 for more  information.  We also need production volunteers to  wield exacto knives, waxer, and (computer)  mouse. We have many willing teachers to  give free sessions on PageMaker and  Wordperfect. If you want to learn new computer skills or just need to brush up, call  Anne at 255-5499. Have we mentioned our  phone number enough? Coming up this  summer will be workshops on paste-up and  design given by ex-prod-co and volunteer  extraordinaire, Winnifred Tovey. She'll  breeze through the basics on the waxer,  cutting copy and graphics, layout, et cetera.  We also have volunteer feedback forms for  you to fill out. It's true—we do want to know  what you think.  Until next time...  Thanks again for all your support. We  couldn't do it without vou.  JUNE 1993 News  Pre-election news:  Putting child care first  by Faith Jones   A national campaign to put childcare  on the agenda for the upcoming federal  election has been launched by the Child Care  Advocacy Association of Canada (CC AAC),  the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women and half a dozen other national  groups.  Childcare activists hope this action,  called "Campaign Child Care," will prompt  federal and provincial political parties to  promise to implement a national, publicly-  funded, high-quality, comprehensive child  care program.  Campaign workers point out that the  Conservative government has frequently  promised such a program, and then reneged  on these promises.  Of the major federal parties, only the  New Democrats have a published policy on  child care. Campaign organizer Jocelyne  Tougas, of the CCAAC, says her organization hopes to pressure the other parties to  create policies on child care so they can be  questioned about them during the election  bour force strategy, a practical plan to combat child, female and family poverty, nor  movement towards women's equality are  possible without the inclusion of child care  as a central component," says the policy  statement by campaign organizers.  Campaign Child Care addresses the benefits of universal child care for children as  well as for parents. Because the working  group includes representatives from the  Native Women's Association of Canada, the  Assembly of First Nations, the Child Poverty Action Group, and the National Organization of Immigrant and Visible Minority  Women, the campaign includes as a specific  goal that child care be anti-racist and culturally appropriate.  The Campaign's literature states: "For  Aboriginal people, child care can be an opportunity for passing on community tradi-  i.  qualifications for child care workers would  create jobs and stimulate the economy.  While the Liberals are something of an  unknownquantity,havingnopolicyonchild-  care, the Tories can be judged on their record  during their two terms in office. During the  1984 election cam paign, the Tories promised  $60 million in start-up funds to be paid  directly to Aboriginal communities to create  culturally appropriate, on-reserve child care.  The bill which would have delivered on this  promise died on the order paper in 1988,  when the Tories called the next election.  More recently, as part of a larger campaign of phasing out federal-to-province  transfer payments, the Tories cut back on  their contribution to subsid izing low-income  parents' child care costs. The Canada Assistance Plan (CAP) is a federal fund which  provinces are able to access to pay subsidies.  In 1991, the Tories capped CAP, by putting  tions and values. Refugee and new immigrant children benefit through an introduction to Canadian life while maintaining contact with their culture of origin through  culturally sensitiveand anti-racist child-care  programs.  "For children whose families are poor,  child care can be an enriching environment  which supplements the home in any of a  variety of ways. Integrated child care environments are efficacious for children who  are physically or developmentally disabled.  Good child care is good for all children."  The platform also links the needs of  child care workers, the vast majority of whom  are women, with the needs of parents and  children. It points out that low wages in the  industry contribute to the unavailability of  trained workers. Nationally, over 80 percent  of children incare are in unlicensed, unregulated arrangements. Raising both wages and  a limitonhow much money tne tnreeweaitru-  est provinces could receive from this fund.  The result in those three provinces, (British  Columbia, Alberta and Ontario) has been  that those provincial governments are using  their own money for subsidies instead of  alleviating the crisis in child care, for example by creating new child care spaces.  "If the Tories were serious about economic and social renewal, they would see  that child care is part of the solution, not part  of the problem," says Nancy Riche of the  CLC.  The Tories promised a national child  care program as part of their election platform in 1984, and reiterated these promises  in 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1991. They have  stalled by convening task forces and parliamentary committees, calling the 1988 election, and once simply by axing the budget  for child care (in 1989). Finally in 1992, Minister of Health and Welfare Benoit Bouchard  flatly announced: "Child care is now considered a last priority."  The provincial part of the campaign is  not geared towards a specific election, but  towards pressuring the provinces to take a  more active role in determining what Canada's child care policy will be. For example,  CCAAC's Tougas would like to see all the  provincial ministers responsible for child  care discuss a national child care program at  their next meeting. She would also like the  provinces to initiate negotiations with the  federal government for a universal child  care plan.  Locally, advocates are trying to raise  awareness of the crisis in child care through  distribution of printed material. For about  ten years, May has been "Child Care Month"  in the city of Vancouver, proclaimed originally by then-Mayor Mike Harcourt. This  year, Harcourt may find himself faced with  questions about what his provincial government is planning to do to address the needs  of parents, children, and child care workers.  Faith Jones is a child care worker who looks  after Lucy, Magnolia, and sometimes  Galen.  Bill C-126: Anti-stalking legislation:  A false sense of security  by Christiana Wiens  For years, women's groups have demanded stricter government action to help  women protect themselves from the violent  men in their lives. The anti-stalking legislation tabled in the House of Commons in  April could have done that, but early reports  say it won't.  According to women's groups, the bill  is severely flawed. It lacks gender-specific  language, needs to be rewritten, and is tied  to governmentbased anti-violence programs.  "The law should state clearly that  women and children need protection from  violent men, whether on the streets or in  their homes," says Florence Hackett of Indian Homemakers, a Native women's organization in Vancouver.  The anti-stalking legislation establishes  a new offense, criminal harassment, which  is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.  Criminalharassment is defined as "...repeatedly following from place to place the  other person or anyone known to them,"  engaging in "threatening conduct," against  the person or a member of their family,  "repeatedly communicating," with the unwilling person, and "besetting or watching"  their whereabouts.  Its useof the term, "person," ignores the  fact that men rape women, and thus, dismisses the larger socio-political issue of violence against women. The legislation's broad  wording means the la w could be used aga inst  women calling their ex-partners for child  support payments. Other types of action  potentially limited by the bill include  picketers in labour disputes and environmentalists targeting a specific location or  company.  With no consultations held before the  bill's first reading, legislative groups have  notconsidered what would be effective on  the front-line. The process around bill C-126  has left many women who are being stalked  and women'sorganizations feelingbypassed  and ignored.  In an open letter from the Metro Action  Committee on Public Violence Against  Women and Children (METRAC), Susan  Bazilli writes: "We wanted a C-49 [the rape  shield law]-style consultation, broad based,  to reflect the representation of women in  Canada."  In his response to this letter, Justice  Minister Pierre Blais, who introduced the  bill in the House, says there will be no such  consultations but he will "consult comprehensively on the larger range of issues relating to violence towards women after the  report of the Canadian Panel on Violence  Against Women becomes available." The  Panel's report is expected at the earliest in  August.  "It's imperative we have more input  from front-line groups and legal experts  working on the issue of violence against  women," says India Mahila Association's  Raminder Dosanjh. Dosanjh says that while  legal measures against stalking are needed,  they also have to be measures tha t ensure the  issue is taken more seriously by government  officials and police.  Under the new legislation, the onus to  prove criminal harassment still rests on the  woman. "If a woman can't phone 911 and  get a police officer who will believe her  when she says she's been followed, beaten,  or raped, what good is it?" asks Zara Suleman  of Women Against Violence Against Women.  The woman will still be required to  prove reasonable fear for herself, her child  and others, a test which questions the stability of the victim. In similar cases, "women  have had to show physical signs of being  victimized before police take them seriously,"  says Suleman.  She believes the law creates a false sense  of security for women because it implies  something new. Yet even the existing laws  that could offer some protection are not  being enforced. "Afterthe fact, laws are hard  to access. We need preventative measures,"  Suleman insists.  Hackett says penalties should also be  severe enough to make men think twice  before abusing their mates. She says even if  stalkers receive the full five-year sentence,  most would be paroled within six months.  Presently, men who receive 10 or 15-year  sentences for rape are often eligible for pa-  See ANTI-STALKING page 4 "'"' News  BC Oppal Commission on policing:  "Human rights crisis  5J  by Shannon e. Ash   Women's groups active in the Greater  Vancouver area came together early in May  to make presentations to a provincial inquiry into policing in British Columbia. The  Oppal Commission was formed last year  and is named after its Commissioner, Justice  Oppal of BC's Supreme Court. Public hearings began in December 1992, and are scheduled to continue through June.  The May session was organized by a  coalition of women's groups including the  Vancouver Status of Women, Vancouver  Rape Relief and Transition House, and  Women Against Violence Against Women  Rape Crisis Centre (WAVAW/RCC) The  all-day hearing was heldatthelndianFriend-  [The Aboriginal  Women's Council] point  out that police have  preconceived notions  when dealing with  Native women—in one  case, a woman who was  assaulted and later  raped was informed...

Women's concerns focused on two areas: police harassment of women, and in  particular, of sex trade workers and women  of colour;and the police's lack of responseor  improper response to women reporting  abuse and sexual assault. Other concerns  included the lack of police accountability  and an ineffective complaints process.  Marie Arringtonof Prostitutes and Other  Women for Equal Rights (POWER) spoke  about police harassment of prostitutes. Sex  trade workers are commonly targeted by  police, who see them as a "source of amusement," says Arrington. They frequently receive tickets for littering or jaywalking,  whether or not the infractions occurred.  Arrington recalled one worker, who received  "Hey! It was  my turn to  overreact!"  a ticket for spitting, saying, "I see men urinating in the corners and on the sidewalk all  the time, and I get a ticket for spitting?!"  Arrington says that when a prostitute is  assaulted by her [male] partner and calls the  police, the police often tell the woman they  will not ta ke the com pla int unless the woman  charges him with "living off the avails" [being her pimp]. Arrington also says women  are picked up by police and dropped off in  rural areas or parks—lately, women have  been taken from the Downtown Eastside  part of town to a poorly lit area on the edge  of an industrial part of town (Strathcona  Park) and told they must work there. And,  says Arrington, prostitutes have been sexually assaulted by police.  Sex trade workers are not laying complaints against the police because it results in  greatly increased harassment, she adds. Police harassment—such as parking outside  her place of work—prevents a prostitute  from working, which is an economic necessity for her. POWER is asking that the complaints process be speeded up and officers  named in complaints be removed from assigned duty "in any case where continuing  contact withthecomplainant is likely." They  also recommend the dissolution of policing  groups whose work takes a specific interest  in sex trade workers.  Arrington also reported that she had  been harassed and insulted by members of  the police force for her work with prostitutes.  Terry Netsena and Jane Gottfriedson,  representing the Aboriginal Women's Council, related the stories of First Nations women  they had interviewed. Many spoke of police  racism, and of being arrested and roughed  up for being drunk. They point out that  police have preconceived notions when dealing with Native women—in one case, a  woman who was assaulted and later raped  was informed, when she called police, "that  there was nothing that they could do be-  ANTI-STALKING from page 3  role after six months, and sometimes serve  only two years of their terms.  Dosanjh says preventative measures  must include police training and more education within communities. "Women need  to know what they can do, who they can  report to, and where information is available."  Furthermore, there is a need in Canada  for "reallocation of resources, so that the  women who are doing the work of saving  the lives of women will be funded," Bazilli  writes.  Bill C-126 is a multi-faceted bill that will  amend parental-child-abduction provisions  and proposes a peace-bond process for child  sexual abuse, sentencing prohibitions for  those convicted of sexual assault of a child,  andadditional protection forchild witnesses.  Bazilli proposes the criminal harassment law should exist on its own, so it can be  discussed separately. Blais has denied this  request.  The bill has already passed third reading in the House of Commons, and is under  review by com mi ttee a s Kinesis goes to press.  It must receive Senate approval before June  23 to become law.

The Aboriginal  Council's brief stresses that police do not see  assaults of Native women as an issue of  much importance or as meriting their attention.  Betty Lough, a representa ti ve of the Congress of Black Women, told the commission  that police often assume black women are  Disabled women may  feel vulnerable and  intimidated while  reporting assaults to  police, especially since  the police are usually  large, able-bodied men.  prostitutes. White officers oftenhaveno contact with black people or communities outside of criminal work, she says. She says the  Congress is calling for recruitment of people  of colour into the police force, screening for  bias, educational programs, as well as greater  accountability.  Police treatment of sexual assault survivors and support workers was also criticized. Zara Suleman and Fawzia Ahmad of  WAVAW/RCC say that survivors are deterred from reporting assaults to the police  because the police tend to pass judgement  on their reports. Suleman said that police are  there to take the report, not act as Crown  counsel or judge.  Suleman and Ahmad spoke out against  the police authorization form, which women  who report sexual assault are told to sign.  This form allows police access to information about the woman which may not have  anything to do with her case, from medical  files, therapist's records, and diaries to any  person willing to give information or opinion. The right of action against any who give  this information is waived. Women are told  that if they do not sign the form, the case may  be dropped.  Bonnie Murray of the Vancouver Lesbian Connection also opposes the consent  form, as it raises the danger of "outing"  closeted lesbians, who therefore become reluctant to report. Homophobia within the  police force is also a concern, says Murray.  She notes there are no out lesbian or gay  officers in the Vancouver policedepartment.  Tracey Macintosh and Lee Lakeman of  Rape Relief pointed out that on average, 20  to 25 per cent of women who use their  services contact police. These women report  that 911 operators, on occasion, make objections to calls and judge which calls require  response.  Also, women who have used alcohol or  drugs, are poor, women of colour, women  who are related to their assailant, or who  make more than one complaint against an  assaulter are less likely to be believed by  police, says Macintosh. Police question women's stability, give advice and opinions, and  blame the woman if she doesn't follow advice.  Both the WAVAW/RCC and Rape Relief representatives reported difficulties  working with the police as front line support  workers. Sexual assault support workers  experience verbal harassment and threats  from police and have not been allowed to  accompany women for support in some  cases.  Several women from the BC DAWN  (DisAbled Women's Network) spoke on the  barriers disabled women face when attempting to get police assistance: disabled women  are often isolated, and may be dependent on  caregivers, and therefore, have no independent access to police. Police stations often  have a lack of facilities—if there is no TDD  phone line, deaf women cannot contact the  police. Women are often labelled "stupid"  and "slow" by the police for having different  speech patterns. They may not be believed.  Repeat reports, for example, of assault, can  result in police labelling them "chronic com-  plainers." Disabled women may feel vulnerable and intimidated while reporting assaults to police, especially since the police  are usually large, able-bodied men. And,  because of their particular vulnerability to  those with power, disabled women are more  likely to be abused.  Of the many recommendations put forward, a common one called for increased  police accountability and an improved complaints process. The current practice of "police investigating police" was criticized [see  page 7.]  While women asked for more police  attention to violence against women—for  example, by actually enforcing peace bonds  laid against women's abusive ex-partners  and preventing stalking, something the po-  liceatpresentoftenbalkfrom doing—women  emphasized that this did not mean they  wanted more money and power given to the  police, but that, in some areas, police should  have less power.  RapeRelief'sMadntoshdecries the trend  toward "militarization" of the police based  on an American model. She notes that police  justify budgets on crime-related policing—  number of arrests, charges laid, and so on.  She says police budgets should be justified  on different grounds: how much liberty and  security of the person exists.  Rape Relief recommends the Police Act  be changed to reflect this. The National Action Committee on the Status of Women's  Shelagh Day called for "zero tolerance" of  discrimination within the police force. Presently, she says, there is a "human rights  crisis" in policing.  Not all groups who wanted to present  were able to that day, due to time limitations. The Vancouver Status of Women, lawyer Gwen Brodsky, who was going to present  on behalf of Drina Read and Patty Mucklow  [see page 7], and the Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre are among groups scheduled to present at a second hearing on police  treatment of women on June 18 at the Abo-  riginal Friendship Centre, 1607 E.

Though characterized as a battle, it is  primarily the response of male tenured faculty members toa reportdescribinga "chilly  climate" for women at UVic which has attracted national attention.  The department formed the Climate  Committee in May last year, which reported  to a department meeting on March 23 this  year. TheCommitteeconsisted of six women:  an untenured professor, two graduates and  three undergraduate students.  The report has not been received wel 1 by  eight tenured male professors.  "I was absolutely dismayed at the virulent attack against us," says committee member Denise McCabe. "1 had nothing in the  way of preparation for that."  According to the unofficial minutes  written by the committee, the March 23 meeting questioned of the committee's validity  and methodology, and then attempted to  refer the report to a new committee for  further study.  An April 8th letter from the eight male  professors to Somer Brodribb, assistant professor and chair of the committee, ends with  the vague threat: "If this matter is not resolved, either by way of the presentation of  credible evidence or by means of your apology and retraction, then it will be necessary  for us to take further steps to protect our  reputations."  The university has since held both informal and formal reviews of the situation. The  male faculty are currently demanding a public investigation into the committee and its  report.  According to Monica Schaefel, acting  chair of the graduate students' women's  caucus, the problem with this approach is  that it "allows the appropriation of the language of 'victim' [by the male professors].  "The Climate Committee is trying to  focus on the things that are going down, but  it's the men shouting 'my reputation, my  reputation' that is capturing the attention of  the administration," said Schaefel.  Carly Stewart, a graduate student, believes the publicity since the report has had  a negative effect. "When the meeting has  ended in such a way that people are upset,  the last thing [committee members] should  do is raise the ante by going public," she  says. "A resolution gets lost in the attempt to  score political points."  Committee member McCabe disagrees  with this description of the events. "We sat  [at the meeting] for an hour and 45 minutes  and they wouldn't let us discuss the substance of [the report] until the end. What has  happened after the report concerns us  too...appropriating the voices of 'victim' is  classic reversal and backlash strategy. It is  [male faculty] all along who have initiated  the attacks," she says.  Some female students have also criticized the report and the actions of the committee for not being fully representative of  female students and for having a feminist  bias. "Whathappenedafter the report...bothers us," says Stewart. "Any criticism [of the  report]... was interpreted as an act of hostility and silencing."  Wynne Mac Alpine, another masters student, says she felt the committee's report  was not representative because it was not  well enough advertised that it was in process.  All critics agree the climate for female  students at universities needs to be addressed  seriously.  "It is essential these things be dealt with.  The professors involved have to be investigated and the report doesn't do that," says  poli sci student Shelley Avram, in an interview with the UVic student newspaper,  Martlet.  ******  v*i  "The Climate Committee  is trying to focus on the  things that are going  down, but it's the men  shouting 'my reputation,  my reputation' that is  capturing the attention  of the administration,"  said Schaefel.  iiWHU i wiiiiniiimii i»»ii»m  The report has also been criticized for  citing the occurrence of sexual harassment  in the department without giving specific  examples.  According to McCabe, however, the  committee did not frame the report to launch  accusations against the male professors.  "They can't seem to get over the fact that  every single solitary discourse is not going to  be about them," she says.  Poli sci women's caucus representative  Jenny Fry said, "It wasn't supposed to deal  with specific incidents. It was a preliminary  report, not the end-all and be-all."  Schaefel likens what has happened to  the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings.  "As soon as he [Clarence Thomas] was able  to appropriate the language of 'the victim,'  he was able to persuade the assembly of men  that he had not done the dirty deed," says  Schaefel.  Meanwhile, current administrative solutions are focused on repairing the damaged reputation of the department and the  male professors.  A formal review of the situation by  Marilyn Callahan, Advisor for the Vice-President Academic on faculty women's issues,  and Andrew Pirie, from the Centre for Dispute Resolution, focuses on allowing "indi-  Hands off my diary!  It was one of those busy Friday afternoons, but over 50 women showed up  outside the law courts in downtown Vancouver to protest a recent order by a BC  Supreme Court judge that a survivor of child sexual abuse hand over her diaries  to the defence.  "First the woman's mind is violated physically, then the most private part of her  mind is violated," says Fawzia Ahmad (above) of Women Against Violence  Against Women (WAVAW) who organized the rally.  WAVAW says the court order will discourage women from reporting assaults,  and is advising women not to sign police forms that authorize the state to gather  any documents, reports or records.  WAVAW's Sarah Leavitt says decisions like this reflect the system's belief  that women make up stories of sexual assault. "They think there will be  information...that proves we are lying."  vidual and departmental reputations" to be  repaired.  The review also demands the retraction of the threatening letter to Brodribb and  provides for the resumption of the committee's work.  "It's my personal opinion that the  review is absolutely baffling," said McCabe.  "It has done nothing but attempt to soothe  ruffled male feathers...there's no room for  students."  Schaefel agrees thatattention is being  misdirected. "The point is women's voices  are getting lost as attention is focused on  whether the report is libellous or not. It's a  very crafty method."  A recent document written by Warren Magnusson, a tenured UVic poli sci  professor, which circulated at UVic and to  the provincial government, also focuses on  men as victims.  Entitled "Feminism, McCarthyism  and Sexist Fundamentalism," the document  in one section states: "These minutes [of the  department meeting] went out... [and] were  evidently drawn from the notes ta ken by the  students present. Their purpose was clearly  to present Somer Brodribb as the voice of  sweet reason, and to discredit all the critics  of her report... I was the principle victim of  this process, since I had advanced most of  the arguments that the Committee did not  like."  The document also charges members  of the committee with distorting events,  memory failure, harassment, poor scholarship and membership in "the creation of a  religious cult, with its prophet and its goddess, and its mass of cult-followers doing  their leaders' bidding."  Committee memberSylvia Bardon says  the document is "the clearest case of hysterical projection I've ever seen in my life. It's  written in an arrogant, ill-informed, personally vindictive and violent manner." Committee members are afraid this document  and other retaliatory actions will damage  both education and career opportunities.  This is not the first document by Magnusson  and other male instructors condemning the  committee.  The right wing press has seized this  opportunity to slam university feministsand  sympathize with the male faculty. An article  published in BC Report, a right-wing publi  cation based in Vancouver, paraphrases the  words of an unnamed professor. "Theobjec-  tive is to cow the department into hiring  more females with a feminist bent and to  intimidate faculty who oppose their appointment. One tool of intimidation is the threat  of sexual harassment charges. 'They've created a sexual harassment industry.'"  The situation at UVic's poli sci department is not a unique scenario of what happens when sexual harassment in the  workplace is challenged. Letters of support  for the committee are pouring in from across  the country.  Constance Backhouse, author of the  Chilly Climate report of the University of  Western Ontario's faculty of law, writes:  "As I read [an article about the events at  UVic], waves of recognition swept over me.  With minor changes of date, geography and  names, the same article could have been  written about my colleagues at the University of Western Ontario or about a series of  incidents which have occurred at Queen's,  Waterloo, Carleton and other universities."  The UVic administration continues to  delay a decision on what to do next. UVic's  current acting president refuses to support  or condemn either the committee's original  report or the actions of the male professors.  "I believe there is an international responsibility to do something," he said when asked  what he intended to do to make female  students feel comfortable in the department  again.  "There needs to be a strategy to get  away from who said what, where they can  say 'it's your fault, you're vilifying me',"  says Schaefel.  She said she opposes any kind of nonconfidential inquiry. "[There's a] power differential being totally ignored," says Schaefel.  "The issue for female students is not to who  and how individual incidents happen[ed]  but the creation of a safe study environment."

The December 9 Coalition, a coalition of  lesbian and gay organizations, is holding  two community meetings to share information about the census, debate whether lesbians and gays should participate in the 1996  Census by Statistics Canada, and discuss  reactions to a March 19 meeting between the  Coalition and StatsCan representative, Pam  White.  At that meeting called by StatsCan, Coalition members who attended expected to be  consulted on ways to include lesbians and  gays in the 1996 census. Instead, they were  told Statistics Canada had already designed,  tested, and rejected many possible questions, and that there had already been a  consultation. White told the Coalition that  changes to the 1996 census are unlikely since  questions already tested by Statistics Canada  show that Canadians cannot agree on a label  for lesbian and gay couples, that is, "spouse,"  "partners," or "in same-sex relationships?"  Statistics Canada rejects unclear questions,  or questions that they believe Canadians  would refuse to answer.  There is already debate within lesbian  and gay communities. Some do not want to  complete a census that excludes them. Others argue that many closeted lesbians and  gays won't identify themselves even on a  anonymous census, so the government's  count would be inaccurate.

JUNE 1993 News  "Police brutality":  Women fight system  by Shannon e. Ash  Two Vancouver women are disillusioned and frustrated after going through  the police complaints process,but they aren't  giving up. They are determined to act until  their concerns are addressed.  Patty Mucklow and Drina Read's struggle began last October, when they were detained and, they say, assaulted by police on  Commercial Drive one night.  Mucklow and Read were visiting friends  off Commercial Drive the evening of October 3. Early the next morning, they left to  walk to a bus stop, accompanied by their  friend Peter Marcus. On the Drive, they saw  two officers in a police car questioning a  man on a bike. They continued walking and  stopped at a bus stop, where Marcus left  them. Mucklow stood, while Read sat on a  bench a short di stance a wa y. Two men stood  outside the nearby Napoli Cafe, talking.  The police car they had seen earlier  pulled up suddenly, and the same policemen got out. Mucklow says, "he looked at  everybody there and we thought he was  going to talk [to us]. Then he started yelling..."  The policeman drew his gun, assumed  a combat position and pointed it at  Mucklow's chest. She was less than 15 feet  away. Mucklow, Read, and the two men  were ordered to put their hands up and then  to get down on the ground. By this time, a  number of police cars had pulled up, including a dog squad and a police van. Witnesses  have stated that the other officers pulled  their guns.  Read was told to stand up and walk  backwards with her hands on her head. She  repeatedly asked what was going on, and  was finally told they'd had a report that  Mucklow and Read had a gun. "They said  they had an exact description of us," says  Mucklow.  Read was handcuffed and searched. So  was Mucklow, who was crying by this time.  "They were laughing at her and saying, 'We  know you're not the one,' but they handcuffed her anyway," says Read.  By this time, a crowd had gathered—the  police had stopped all traffic in the area.  Finally, the handcuffs were taken off.  Read says she was near fainting. They were  led to a bench by the police officers, "at least  ten" of whom surrounded them, loudly telling them, "you have to understand. It was a  man with a gun...or a walkman."  Says Read: "It was kind of...an intimidation. I know these guys didn't think we  would speak up about it after, we certainly  didn't at the time, until we were safe at  home."  The main issues of their complaint are:  how valid was it that the officers would have  identified them as suspects; why were weapons drawn; and why were they treated as  they were afterwards by the police.  The 911 call which the police were responding to did not give an exact description. After an effort was made to find out  what the call had actually said, it was learned  that the caller had reported that four or five  youths were seen in the area, one of them  holding what appeared to be a gun. In the  internal investigation report, it was later  admitted the information was "erroneous."  Mucklow and Read point out that they  are women, and they were waiting quietly  for the bus. The two men were some distance  away. They believe that the police actually  saw them earlier, at 3rd and Commercial,  walking with their friend Marcus, who "has  a beard and grey hair, and is a middle-aged  The police continued to detain them  even after they had told Mucklow they knew  the women weren't the suspects. Mucklow  and Read say the police were laughing and  joking. Read says she was told, "This is  something to tell your grandchildren."  They were also "searched."Read recalls  she had shorts on, "and they were rubbing  up and down my legs." Mucklow says they  searched "under my breasts and on my  legs. ..they didn't go throughmy jacket. They  after Christmas, but it didn't occur until late  February. In the meantime, Mucklow and  Read had been writing letters to the Attorney-General and provincial politicians, asking for action. The Attorney-General's office  said they would wait for the police report.  The women also spoke to the Oppal  Commission at a December hearing, and  several stories appeared in the local media.  "Every time we have spoken out publicly we  have gotten a response [from the police],..it  were smiling at me at this time...they knew  I had nothing on me."  They were not legally arrested, nor were  they read their legal rights.  "I would think that if you'd made a  mistake, you'd be a bit shaken up...there  were no signs of remorse, or apologies, or  concern for us," says Mucklow.  Mucklow talks of the shock of the experience and the fear she felt for her life. "I  couldn't even open my mouth to say, 'I'm  innocent, I'm just waiting for the bus, you've  made a mistake.' His finger was on the  trigger, itcould have just simply slipped and  there wouldn't have been a chance, it was so  close."  Read says she lost feeling in her right  hand while the cuffs were on. "My doctor  said that if the police had kept them on any  longer, I would have had permanent nerve  damage." She also suffered muscle nerve  damage from being shoved against a car.  Since the incident, both women have  suffered from stress and nightmares. Read  says," We didn't sleep, couldn't eat. I had  just got a job that is half-decent with the  federal government...I had to miss a week of  work and I was...scared I was going to lose  my job..A lot of [our friends] live in the East  End and [Mucklow] wouldn'tgoback. We've  been back twice and both times have been  really difficult."  They filed a complaint with police on  October 6. A month later, they received a  letter saying it had been filed. They were  unable to get a meeting with the investigator, Detective Blakeman, until December.  "We just assumed that...within days after this happened, while it's still fresh in our  minds,...they would question us about what  happened," says Mucklow.  They were told by Blakeman tha t he had  talked to the officers and was working on a  report; they were promised another meeting  after Christmas, but it didn't occur until late  could be six weeks of no response, and  then., we get a letter the next day," says  Read. "So, if a...citizen who's afraid to speak  in public has a complaint, they don't have a  chance."  Mucklow and Read also attended a forum on police violence sponsored by the  Asian communities, and learned that many  complaints against the police by Asians have  not been addressed. "If we weren't white  and English-speaking, [our complaint]  would have gone in the back drawer, along  with their's," says Read.  Besides the long waits, the women have  experienced other problems with the complaints process. Mucklow and Read claim  police withheld or gave incorrect information.  For example, when asked for the names  of the officers first on the scene, they were  given two names, one of which was later  revealed to be the name of a police dog. The  police then claimed that the dog squad, with  one officer, was first on the scene, contrary to  the women's and other witnesses' accounts.  In the police dispatch recording, the reporting officer was found to have said, "We have  the suspects."  The women were told the police report  was to be released March 4, but it wasn't  released until March 30, almost six months  after the incident.  In the police report, by Inspector Davies  who had taken over the investigation, the  police claim the delays were the fault of the  complainants and a witness. The report  notes"the reluctance of a civilian witness to  participate in an interview." Mucklow and  Read say this is Marcus, who wasn't contacted until five months after the event, even  though police had his name and phone  number. At this time, being a union member  at Shaughnessy Hospital which the government had just announced would be closed,  Marcus told police he couldn't meet imme  diately and would have to arrange a later  time.  The report also attributes the delay to  Mucklow and Read's "refusal to authorize  access to routine medical information." The  women say the police told them to give all  the information in their medical files, but  their lawyers advised them they only needed  to give the police a summary of the injuries  that occurred during the incident.  The police report states that "the use of  police firearms was appropriate under the  circumstances, given you were considered  to be armed suspects...There is no evidence  to substantiate Police Act or Criminal Code  charges against the police members in that  they acted on reasonable and probable  grounds and conducted themselves  in an appropriate fashion under the  circumstances...The investigation did not  verify your claim that a police member stated,  'This is something to tell your grandchildren  about'."  The report also says, "When it became  apparent to the police members that you  were not armed, you were immediately released." It claims the women were given  apologies and provided comfort and assistance.  Victim Services was called, say the  women, after they asked for a ride home—  the bus was long gone—but they received no  counselling.  Mucklow says the report "does not deal  with the question 'why were we considered  armed suspects?' There's no reason, there's  no legal evidence...[It was] just an officer  saying that. Now, if an officer can just say,  'Well, I believed they were the armed suspects,' that leaves the whole door open to  prejudice."  "Our whole [complaint] has not been  taken seriously and, as women, we feel we  are not beingta ken seriously," says Mucklow.  Read agrees. "We've been treated like children over and over by these men in the  police department."  The women filed a civil suit against the  police in early April, assisted by lawyers at  the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, who  followed the internal investigation through  with them. They had recently dropped the  suit, although their lawyer says they have a  strong case. The suit charges false imprison-  ment,assault,andviolationof Charter Rights  to liberty and security of the person. The  lawyer, Chuck Reasons, says he believes the  Police Act was violated as well, in that there  were no reasonable grounds for the officer to  draw his weapon. According to the Police  Act, an officer may not draw his revolver  except for the protection of life or the lives of  others or apprehension of a person believed  dangerous.  Mucklow and Read dropped the suit for  several reasons. They expected it to be a  long, stressful process for little return—they  might have gotten some financial compensation, but the police officers would probably not have been prosecuted.  If they lost, they could be liable for the  legal costs of the police. There is also little  chance, if they won the suit, that it would  change the law or police procedures—it  would take a number of similar cases to do  that.  "Suing isabout money," saysMucklow.  "We feel this is about justice, not money."  Right now, they say, it is up to the  Attorney-General of BC to pursue the matter.  But, they also say, they "are not going  away."  Shannon e.

What's News  by Lissa Geller  Hospital promotes  infant formula  Breast-feeding advocates are angry that  the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster is accepting a large cash donation  from Mead Johnson, makers of infant formula, in exchange for stocking the formula  in its maternity ward.  "I think they're doing mothers a major  disservice. The hospital is allowing itself to  market a product for the formula companies, which is akin to giving out cigarettes"  says Verity Livingstone, of the Vancouver  Breastfeeding Centre. She notes that children who are not breast-fed are more prone  to infections, and need more hospital care  than babies fed mother's milk.  Hospital spokesperson Joanne Konnert  denies there's a link between hospital breastfeeding practises and the large donation.  However the fact that the formula is  available in the maternity ward can give  women the impression that there is no difference between breastfeeding and form ula.  "A majority of women start out  breastfeeding, but most give up in the first  few weeks. Aggressive marketing gives  them the impression that formula is a rea-  sonablealternative," says Renee Hefti,anurse  at the hospital.  Livingstone agrees, saying most women  begin by breastfeeding but are discouraged  if even small problems arise, and tha 170 per  cent of newborn babies in hospitals are given  sugar water and formula by staff if there is  any problem at all.  By giving out sugar water and formula  to newborns, hospita Is only contribute to the  problem. "Instead of trying to understand  the cause of those problems, people jump in  very quickly with a bottle of formula. This  interferes with successful lactation. The  women don't produce enough milkand very  quickly as they leave the hospital, they resort  to using more and more formula."  Midwifery to be  legalized in BC  Women in BC may finally have the  choice to have their babies at home with a  midwife or in the hospital in the care of a  midwife without fear of legal prosecution.  BC Health Minister Elizabeth Cull announced May 10 that the province will be  changing legislation to allow midwives to  become fully licensed medical practitioners.  "This government's firs t priority will be  to appoint a board that will set regulations  and standards to ensure midwife-assisted  childbirth is a safe option for the women of  BC," said Cull atthe 23rd Triennial Congress  of the International Confederation of Mid-  wives conference in Vancouver.  BC will join Ontario and Alberta as the  only provinces in Canada where midwifery  is legal.  The decision follows on the heels of a  Health Professions Council report recommending that midwifery be legalized, that a  college for midwives be established in BC,  and that midwives be fully integrated into  the current health system.  Not surprisingly, doctors are reluctant  to give up their monopoly on the birth process. The BC Health Association has issued a  statement saying that, while it supports the  concept of midwifery, it does not support  midwifery in a "home setting." They also  warn that medical costs could rise as a result  of this legislation.  But Linda Knox of the Midwives Association of BC says the opposite will likely be  true. She expects that since midwifery requires less "high tech" interventions, the  legalization of midwifery will result in a  lowering of health care costs.  Knox also notes that most midwives  have a greater knowledge of obstetrics and  infant care than most physicians do. "Mid-  wives view the process of birth as a natural,  positive process that has been subject to too  much medical intervention, especially the  practice of doing Caesarean sections."  It is expected to take up to a year to  license midwives currently practising illegally in BC. By then, the Ministry hopes to  have pilot projects set up to facilitate low-  risk home births and to have built "birthing  centres," next to hospitals, in some cases, for  women wishing to give birth outside of  hospital settings.  PMS labelled  mental disorder  Recent recommendations to include a  severe form of PMS in the diagnostic "bible"  of the American Psychiatric Association as a  mental disorder has women's groups and  feminists concerned.  There is a campaign based in Toronto to  stoptheinclusionofpre-menstrualdisphoric  disorder from being classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). This  manual is used in the US and all over the  world, including Canada, as a tool to diagnose people with mental illnesses.  "It's clear that some women do have  symptoms that make their lives difficult just  before their periods start, but defining that  biological event as a mental illness is wrong  and dangerous," says Paula Caplan, a Toronto psychiatrist, who is working on the  campaign.

The classification could also be used against  women in child custody hearings and divorce cases.  "Hormones are used to pathologize  women only. How about male behaviour?  There is research to show that men have  hormonal cycles. They have a hard time  expressing their feelings. How about that as  a mental disorder?"  Dodie Pirie, coordinator of the life skills  and PMS program at the Women's Regional  Health Centre in Toronto, agrees. She says  she's concerned this move will contribute to  women being labelled "irrational."  "About 90 per cent of women are estimated to suffer from some degree of  PMS...this [classification] would reinforce  the notion that women 'go crazy' once a  month."  The Women's College Hospital, in a  rare move, issued a press statement on April  27 protesting the move by the APA to classify the PMS condition in the DSM-IV. The  Hospital's statement says the move singles  women out: "It is known that people of both  sexes suffer from hormonal mood changes.  The APA is planning to use this classification to help women but the effect will be the  opposite."

CrisantaSampang, spokesperson for the  West Coast Domestic Workers Association  says the all-white committee lacks the sensitivity and understanding to deal with the  plight of domestic workers, the majority of  whom are women of colour and are on the  "lowest rung" of the employment ladder.  "We are afraid that the visible minority  women especially will continue to suffer  racism, harassment, long hours of work and  low pay" as a result of the committee's lack  of representation, says Sampang.  She adds that the government took great  pains to include representatives from both  business and labour but was not at all concerned about the issue of colour. Sampang  says the "oversight" is sexist as well as racist  because domestic work is not valued in this  country.  Charan Gill, a representative of farmworkers in BC, says government bureaucrats often exclude people of colour because  of an underlying racist assumption that they  won't be able to do the job. "It is normal for  them to omit the people who are powerless."  Both groups want thecommittee to identify domestic and farm workers as the most  exploited of all labourers in BC. As well,  they want representatives to sit on the committee who are domestic and farm workers,  to provide balance and sensitivity to their  issues.  Ministry officials say they are aware of  the groups' concerns but could not say  whether changes in the makeup of the committee were imminent. Of the seven present  Committee members, three are women:  Carolyn Califoux of the New Westminster  and District Labour Council; lawyer Anita  Braha; and Susan Arnold of the Coalition of  BC Businesses.

VOS 1E0 Feature   Logging in Clayoquot Sound:  NDP bows to industries  by Nancy Pollak  To say that the logging of Clayoquot  Sound is about cutting trees is like saying  violence against women is about bruises and  bad-tempered guys. It is, but there's more,  much more and that's what should concern  you. Clayoquot Sound is about more than  not seeing the forest for the stumps; it's  about whodecides whether ecosystems,com-  munities and cultures live or die. Who, you  ask? Try MacMillan Bloedel...  Unless you've been snoozing since April,  the decision by BC's New Democratic government to allow logging in 63 percent of  Clayoquot Sound will not be news. The  NDP's buckling to industry pressure and the  resulting outcry by environmentalists, Aboriginal peoples and other concerned citizens  has kept Clayoquot on the media's front  burner, nationally and abroad.  The attention is deserved. Clayoquot  Sound is an extraordinary preserve of old-  But Clayoquot is being logged, even as  you read this. The Sound's network of islands, fiords, valleys, creeks and watersheds  is already pockmarked by clear cuts, and  active logging continues in the Bulson River  Valley and Tofino Creek. The NDP's plan  allows for standard clear cutting and 'environmentally-friendly' techniques such as  selective and aerial logging, 30 hectare block  cuts,and "special management zones." (What  makes them special is, so far,anyone'sguess.)  This, a long with the preserva tion of the Megin  watershed and some scenic coastal areas, is  why the NDP claims their Clayoquot decision is fair and balanced.  It's a balance that escapes Langer, who  has lived and worked in Tofino for six years.  "This is an industry decision," she says. "It's  basically Option Five, put forward by Interfor  and agreed to by MacBlo." (International  Forest Products and MacMillan Bloedel, the  major tree farm licence-holders inClayoquot,  in what activists now describe as a  Valerie Langer of Friends of Clayoquot Sound  growth temperate rain forest on Vancouver  Island's west coast [see map]. The Sound's  first claim to the extraordinary lies in the  mere fact that it still exists. The last sizable  tract of temperate rain forest in North  America and one of few large temperate  stands anywhere, Clayoquot's environmental significance is matched only by its extraordinary beauty.  According to Valerie Langer, an activist  with the Tofino-based Friends of Clayoquot  Sound (FOCS): "Many conservation biologists speculate that Clayoquot Sound may  be the only area left on Vancouver Island  la rge enough to perpetuate the entire genetic  blueprint of the old-growth forest, from large  predators such as cougars to...woodpeckers  and specialized nitrogen-fixing tree lichens."  To the logging industry, Clayoquot is  trees. To others, Clayoquot is the majestic  natural stage for a drama of stream and  slope, fish and soil, forest canopy and insects, black bears and decaying wood.  "By logging Clayoquot," says the FOCS's  Garth Lenz, who recently toured northern  Europe with Langer, "we're unravelling the  fabric of the temperate rain forest, and we're  losing its pattern."  FOCS formed 14 years ago when Native  and non-Native people came together to  protest logging on Meares Island, where the  Tla-o-qui-aht live. FOCS are opposed to all  logging in Clayoquot and want the region  declared a protected Natural Wilderness Heritage Site, with respect shown for Native  concerns.  'talk and log' process through the Sustainable Development Task Force for Clayoquot  Sound, which formed in 1989 and ultimately  floundered.)  Langer draws a particular bead on the  'block cuts' concept, which the NDP claims  will offset the environmental damage of full-  scaleclear cuts. In 1991, MacBlo logged three  30-hectare areas in Clayoquot's Cold Creek.  Within a year, the buffer zones between the  cuts had blown down, creating a bleak 125  hectare clear cut. Blow downs and massive  erosion are inevitable in the steep mountain  valleys of this rainy region. The erosion  caused by logging and road-building is devastating to rivers, with their fish spawning  grounds, and to coastal shellfish beds. "Eighty  percent of the forest's biodiversity is in the  soil and groundcover," says Langer. "These  cuts are not feasible in the temperate rain  forest."  If you expected something better from  the NDP, expect again.  "The people who control this government are the same people who controlled the  last one," Langer says.  The political leverage of the giant forest  companies is evident in the Clayoquot decision. It's leverage with an impressive and  scary foundation. Eighty-six percent of BC's  landmass is managed by the ministry of  forests and, according to the Pulp, Paper and  Woodworkers of Canada (PPWC), more than  95 percent of those public forests are virtually owned by a handful of forest corporations with their vast tree farm licenses. The  corporations, in turn, are controlled by foreign investors. Oh Canada.  While industry, governments and the  regressive leaders of some unions (notably,  the International Woodworkers of America)  ridicule environmentalists as 'tree-huggers'  or condemn them as preservationists with  no regard for workers and their families, the  politics of the forests are far more complex.  In some ways, Clayoquot Sound is a microcosm of what ails this country: a badly managed and shrinking resource-based economy,  on stolen aboriginal land, run by medium-  men who are laying off small-men at the  behest of Very Jumbo Men in transnational  corporations.  If that sounds like bad rhetoric (which it  also is), consider this:  • the trees of Clayoquot are 'under the  chainsaw' because BC has been logged at a  30 percent higher rate than the forest can  sustain (in short, it's running out);  • haste makes waste boggling waste: at  best, clear cutting leaves 25 percent of wood  on the ground; at worst, 50 percent. And  that's just a small fragment of the forestry  waste panorama. (Pssst: haste makes hasty  profits, too);  • despite the cutting frenzy, 60 percent  of BC's forestry and mill jobs have disappeared in the last 10 years; another 20,000  will vanish in five years. These losses can't  be pinned on environmental or First Nations' concerns, but on labour-reducing technological change and global re-structuring;  • the Tla-o-qui-aht, Hesquiat, Ahousa-  hat,ToquahtandUclueletpeopleshavenever  ceded title to the Clayoquot region, and are  firmly opposed to the recent decision. With  their unemployment rate running as high as  70 percent, they have not ruled out logging  but they want to manage it themselves;  • BC exports huge amounts of its best  quality logs, unprocessed. By failing to 'add  value' to raw logs through manufacturing  wood products, the industry is, in effect,  exporting 2,500 to 4,000 jobs every year.  "We've focused on the wilderness issue  at Clayoquot," says Langer, "but the employment issue also needs to be addressed."  While Langer and the FOCS weren't surprised the NDP gave in to big business, they  did expect a more jobs-oriented approach.  "They didn't even decide in favour of labour. There's no job strategy, no provisions  for secondary industry. Labour and the environment are both left in the lurch."  For many progressive observers, including the PPWC, a key ingredient in salvaging  BC's forest industry and one that can accommodate Aboriginal, environmental and employment concerns is to ensure that trees cut  in Canada a re processed in Canada. Another  key, says Langer, is a legislated forest practices code.  "We have only guidelines now," she  says, "which means the public has no recourse against companies doing improper  logging. They can log down to the salmon  streams and we can't take them to court, and  we can't get them out." Forest codes are the  norm in Europe, says Langer. "Our logging  practices are illegal in Europe. The forester  would be arrested and jailed."  In Clayoquot, arrests are reserved for  Langer and other activists who blockade  roads and bridges. The FOCS, who enjoy  wide support in Tofino and among First  Nations, are committed to non-violent civil  disobedience and have little regard for outsiders like Paul Watson, who advocates tree  spiking in Clayoquot. "Watson isn't doing  us any favours," says Langer. "He's parachuting in after we've done the work, he's  media -mongering. We need pitblic support."  Langer's feminism is apparent in how  she understands Clayoquot. "The economic.  systems that fuel logging are based on a  male-powered world view," she says. More  than just a view, it's a male world. "In logging, all the jobs are for men, except for the  secretaries. At Clayoquot, it's an entirely  male-oriented workforce: the police, the  workers, the managers are all men. The men  are talking about their logging jobs, but 50  percent of the blockaders are women. And  it's like they hear us saying, "we're cutting  into your world, why should we support  you? " They're threatened because we're trying to look at new ways of working, at a new  economic base, not at this [system] that we've  been eliminated from."  Langer also notes how the blockaders'  non-violence affects the confrontations with  loggers. "When we don't shout back, they  don't know what to do with us. It dissipates  the aggression and we end up talking. And  when we talk, we often agree. They're not  stupid, they're scared for their jobs. Last  summer, after the Clayoquot River Bridge  action, the workers and blockaders decided  to all meet. We wanted to find two things we  could work on together and, at the first  meeting, we found 14. But there were fewer  people at the next meeting, because they  were getting lots of pressure from the local  Share group [Share groups are industry-  sponsored bodies that claim to support labour and communities.]. The Bfeetings are  still happening, but they're tentative."  Support for preserving Clayoquot is  anything but tentative. Langer and photographer Garth Lenz's European tour sparked  the formation of Temperate Rainforest Campaigns in England, Scotland, Belgium and  Germany. On July 1st (recognize the date?),  environmentalists in Japan, Italy, Malaysia  and Germany will stage a Day of Protest  against the logging of Clayoquot. In BC, the  NDP government is snagged in a possible _  conflict of interest due to their purchase of  MacBlo shares in February, and the Commission on Resources and the Environment  (CORE) has offered some compelling options, including a suggestion that the federal  government declare Clayoquot a protected  UN Biosphere Reserve.  And the logging continues. If you're in  the market for a longer, hotter summer,  Clayoquot Sound may be this season's destination of choice.

JUNE  1993 Feature  Interview with Judy Rebick:  It's been a slice  as told to Agnes Huang and Fatima  ^ Jaffer   As president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) for the  last three years, Judy Rebick lias been credited  with NAC's strong presence on the Canadian  political scene and the organization's development into a more radical, feminist, grassroots  ^ organization. Kinesis spoke with Rebick in Vancouver last month, before she stepped down as  president of NAC at the organization*"s Annual  General Meeting in early]une.  Fatima Jaffer: How do you feel on the eve  of your departure?  Judy Rebick: I feel great. I feel really  good about Sunera Thobani taking over as  president of NAC. She'll do a terrific job. It's  - • been an exciting time for NAC and I hope it  will be even more exciting. I feel good about  NAC having a strong executive and that  regionalization is happening. But I feel like  I've accomplished a lot and that feels good.  I'm ready to take it a little easier (laughter),  for the first time in my life.  Agnes Huang: For a week maybe!...Are  you going to stay involved with NAC ?  Rebick: Yes. I'll be on the NAC executive  as past president and I want to work primarily on fund-raising. I'd like to see NAC  become completely non-dependent on government funding—that's my goal in the next  year.  Personally, I want to do some writing. I  think I may write a book, or at least some  articles. One frustration I had while 1 was  active in the pro-choice struggle was that  neither of us wrote about it—it was always  some journalist or some academic who got  to write the story. I want to write about the  incredible experience NAC has had over the  last three years and I believe it's important  that someone who lived through it write  about it.  Jaffer: How long have you been involved with NAC?  Rebick: I started getting involved around  1984, when I was with the Ontario Coalition  for Abortion Clinics (OCAC). I went to a  NAC AGM. At the time, OCAC was on the  extreme left of NAC. I wouldn't give NAC  the time of day.  But Laurel Ritchie, who was involved in  the union movement, spent a lot of time  trying to convince me [and other activists]  that NAC was important, that it had an  employment committee that would organize strikes — important things like that. So,  we went to the NAC AGM, put forward  _^      resolutions and argued from the floor.  Huang: How did the organization evolve  in terms of the women involved?  Rebick: Within two or three years, the  composition of NAC changed. There were  mostly professional women at the first meeting I went to. Then activists in the women's  movement started to get involved fro various reasons. We formed a left caucus in  NAC, which caused a lot of controversy,  because, unlike the right, which met behind  closed doors, we wanted to have an open  caucus and invite all the women who wanted  to come. Out of the three to four hundred  women at the AGM, we would have about  60 women at the left caucus.  I remember when the Tories refused to  attend a NAC lobby [meetings with political  parties.] We put forward a resolution to  cancel the lobby and march on the Parliament buildings instead. This caused a huge  debate. The more liberal women felt we  would lose our credibility. The left in English Canada and the Francophone women  supported the march. We won by a two-  thirds vote of the general membership. The  next morning, some women said, "we can't  do this," and the right on NAC's executive  said they would resign if we marched on  Parliament. This was the way NAC functioned. What finally happened is we held the  lobby [with opposition parties] and had the  demonstration. It was an OK compromise,  but it was frustrating for me to see this lack  of democracy in NAC. There were no priorities and no one seemed willing to take the  political leadership to prioritize two or three  issues. The executive gave little leadership to  women at the AGM. It was left up to women  from the floor.  Jaffer: Did the grassroots ever manage  to set the agenda?  Rebick: Well, NAC has always been  good on Aboriginal women's issues and  that's because there has always been a strong  participation of Aboriginal women in NAC.  The organization was involved in the issue  of status and non-status Aboriginal women,  for example.  Butwith women of colour, itwas different. NAC prioritized resolutions in alphabetical order by category, so "visible-minority women" were at the end. Their resolutions usually got dropped and the executive  would say, 'wedidn't have time'. I was never  questioned why we prioritized resolutions  this way.  Jaffer: How did NAC begin to become  a more accountable organization?  Rebick: The first transformation that took  place was the increased participation of feminist activists, rather than professional  women, who didn't need NAC anymore.  Increasingly, NAC was attended more by  feminist activists, rather than professional  women, who didn't need NAC anymore.  Increasingly, NAC became more fac-  tionalized. It all blew up when two women  rain for president in 1986. It was a bitter  division. Lynn Kaye, who became president, took what was an organization in tatters, and rebuilt it to where it was on its feet.  When I took over, it was functioning as  an organization with a changed composition. It was more activist-based, and more  radical. That was, more or less, when the left  politics started. Lynn spent a lot of time  trying to get women like me more involved  at a leadership level.  Huang: How have the priorities for  NAC changed over the three years that you've  been president?  Rebick: First, we started to have priorities. The year before I became president, we  decided to have campaigns. NAC had never  had campaigns before. It was BC women  were pushing for this. In the last five years,  there's been a very strong BC caucus in NAC  —other than Quebec, it's the only region  that's really been organized. The BC women  fought for NAC to have a very different kind  of orientation. Their idea was we should be  much more focused on regional grassroots  work and campaigns, and much less on  policy and lobbying.  At the AGM where I became president,  there was a big debate. The BC women  proposed getting rid of NAC'S policy committees and moving towards campaigns.  These policy committees had really been  NAC's strengths up to then. The Ontario  women and the women who were on the  executive, just completely reacted. We had  an incredible polarization.  We came to a compromise. We said we  have to keep what's good and strong about  NAC, and at the same time move in the  direction of more regionalization and more  campaigns. Since then, we've moved more  in the direction of campaigns and our policy  committees play less of a role than they used  to.  Huang: Is NAC making inroads towards regionalization?  Rebick: Yes. This is the first year we've  actually made progress. Again, in BC, it's the  most structured. But it's happening in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario. In Quebec, they've  always had a regional group because they  have a more autonomous way of functioning.  NAC always had a profile at a national  level, but there was no base. We couldn't  mobilize. Women didn't see themselves as  part of NAC. When I first started travelling  Rebick in Vancouver  as NAC president, I found that nobody identified themselves as part of NAC. NAC was  something "over there in Toronto." We've  managed to [change this] through regionalization. Now, women feel much more  plugged into NAC and what we're starting  to see is the leadership of NAC coming from  women at the grass-roots.  Jaffer: I believe the grassroots led the  push for NAC to take a No-position in the  referendum on the constitution last year and  that some members of the executive had  actually been leaning towards a Maybe?  Rebick: Well, I was initially hesitant to  go for the No campaign in the referendum  because I didn't think we could pull it off  without enough of a base. We didn't argue  for a position at the executive meeting, we  presented options — the flat-out No option,  the No-But option, and the Maybe option,  and then look at their positive and negative  aspects. What happened in the discussion  was my proudest moment in the women's  movement. I realized that the women in the  executive were rooted in their communities  in a way we never were before. A lot of the  women activists at the grassroots level were  saying No. Women of colour were strongly  for the No. The Aboriginal women at the  executive told us their communities were  strongly for a No. And so were the trade  union women. It was a transformative moment for me because I knew this organization had really changed. That's what gave us  the strength to do it.  What happened in the executive was a  process of coming to a consensus in a way I  had never seen happen before. [Women]  who were strongly for a No, argued the  other side...We talked about what the risks  were in the No position. It wasn't a consensus of guilting the women who didn't agree,  it was listening to what everyone was saying.  [Once we agreed to say No,] we said:  "How are we going to minimize the risks."  The women there were willing to take any  risks necessary to do it—including losing the  organization. We said, ultimately, if we make  a decision based on saving NAC rather than  on what is in the best interests of women, we  are doing the same thing we criticize political parties of.  I think [the referendum debate] was my  proudest moment, not just for NAC but in  my whole political life. I saw what feminist  process really was.  Huang: You are talking about how NAC  has evolved and changed. But how about  you?  Rebick: Me? Oh, I've changed a tremendous amount. ..I had a make-over (laughter).  I came out of the left where, in order to  survive and be a leader as a woman, I became very male-identified, functioning politically like a man. When I became president  of NAC, I learned two main things. One was  that we had to change the culture of the  organization.  The first year, we had three Aboriginal  women on the executive. We were having a  discussion, and one woman got really upset  and walked out of the room. The Aboriginal  women looked uncomfortable and [one of  them] said, "Well, we don't do things this  way. If somebody is upset, we think it's part  of what's going on. We stop the process and  talk about the feelings." So we started a  process of checking in, talking about how  we were feeling. It actually helped us to not  get wired and freaked out at each other, or  have the emotions from one discussion carry  over to another. I learned a lot from that.  The other thing I learned was from  women of colour. I learned that, what was a  necessary strategy in the left as a woman  where I had to prove myself to men, was  oppressive behaviour here. I had to learn  how to not push for what I thought, and  sometimes go along with things I wasn't  sure were right.  I had always been an anti-racist  activist...but I never understood [privilege],  I always railed against the idea of having  privilege because I had white skin. I would  never accept that; I thought it was a guilt trip.  I started to understand better what white  skin privilege meant—not in a guilting way  but in a political way.  Jaffer: How?  Rebick: It was a process. For example, I  was determined to heal the division with  Quebec women. I was strong on the national  question and thought that the women's  movement in English Canada really fucked  up badly on that. I proposed we have a tour  with a Quebec woman, an Aboriginal  woman, and a woman from the rest of  Canada on the national question.  Salome Lucas [a member of the executive from Ontario] argued that we also had  to have a woman of colour to talk about  issues of racism. I fought her, saying, "its not  the same thing." She wasn't saying issues of  immigration and race were the same as the  nationalism question, but that's how I heard  it. I argued and she got angry and walked  out of the meeting. That was a critical moment for us, and for me. We decided we  wouldn't go ahead with the campaign until  we could sort this out. We talked about it and  then I finally understood what she was talk-  ingabout. She was right and we were wrong.  That wasan important moment forour process. It also made me understand that my  own experience can define how I see an  issue.  The [Canadian Panel on Violence  Against Women] is another example. When  the panel was set up, it was I who argued we Feature  had to support the panel because we had  called for this Royal Commission and because our member groups had wanted it.  But Sunera [Thobani], and Ann McGrath,  who was chair of our violence committee at  the time, were opposed to NAC supporting  the panel. I argued in the executive against  Sunera and I won.  Then things started fucking up, and  there was a crisis in Toronto with women of  colour caucuses [which met to discuss what  to do], followed by a NAC round table  discussion [see Kinesis, Jul./Aug. 92.J I realized I was coming from a position of privilege—I was worrying about the credibility  oftheorganization.Ididn't understand what  women of colour were understanding about  the problems of the panel. It was not only the  issue of lack of representation [on the panel].  It was the issue of taking away the work  from the front line workers. And the women  of colour understood all that much better  than I did and I had to come to grips with  that.  I think a lot of women probably never  believed NAC would stick their necks out  [by taking that stand], or be willing to risk its  credibility over an issue of racism. It was a  test.  Jaffer: It was a test that had an incredible  impact across the country. Women, and particularly women of colour, trusted NAC  more for taking that stand.  Rebick: Yes, and I also learned the importance of caucuses, not as divisive things,  but as ways for women of colour to have  more power in the organization. What I had  to learn was how to be part of a process that  was more egalitarian and in which I didn't  dominate. I've gone through an incredible  learning process and it's been great for me. I  feel better about myself and I think I'm more  ef fecti ve as a political leader than 1 was when  I started.  Jaffer: NAC has become a much more  accountable grass-roots organization with a  much higher profile. A lot of people credit  you for that. What do you see as a reason for  the change?  Rebicfc.Ithinkitwasaninevitablechange.  NAC either had to make the change in this  direction or die. And as the women's movement changed, NAC had to change or women  would set up something else. I think my  leadership helped the change to happen in a  more harmonious, less divisive, way than it  would have otherwise happened. I think  that's what I accomplished.  Jaffer: The real push was coming from  the membership...  Rebick: Yes, like from [the women from]  BC.  Jaffer: How about women of colour?  Rebick: Leadership came from women  of colour inside of NAC. I did come into the  presidency with the commitment to bring  more women of colour and more Aboriginal  women onto the executive but I didn't lead  the changes, we worked together.  The women of colour who came before  fought hard on their own. They stayed on in  NAC, even though they felt tokenized and  would be upset and angry after meetings,  because they believed inN AC and that things  had to change. They took being marginalized  inside NAC, and pressure from some women  of colour who thought they were sell-outs  for working in NAC, and kept pushing for  change. The credit for that goes to them.  Huang: How about NAC's higher profile in the media?  Rebick: The media stuff comes from two  things: I'm pretty good in the media, but it  was from the collective tha 11 got the strength  to do that work. It was a collective decision  and strategy to do media work. Everything  I did in the course of that referendum came  from the executive.  Huang: Why dp you think that NAC is  being seenas, sort of the "Judy RebickShow"?  Rebick: The media likes personalities. I  think people relate to personalities better  too. This is struggle we had in the OCAC  years ago—I argued we had to have a major  spokesperson because, otherwise, Henry  Morgentaler [a doctor and pro-choice advocate] would become the voice of the pro-  choice movement. I wanted women on the  frontlines in the pro-choice movement to be  Sunera is very skilled with media work and,  in fact, is much better than I when I first  started.  Maintaining unity—with Quebecois  women and trade union women, for example—is very important, because that's been  Judy Rebick in action at the anti-NAFTA rally in Ottawa May 15  visible. We had to have someone people  could recognize.  One of the things we worried about  when I decided to step down was: would we  lose the profile? Now [after the coverage  we've received about the NAC presidency],  it's clear we're not going to. In fact, that's one  thing I feel best about—it's NAC that has the  profile, not just me.  Huang: A lot of the press Sunera's getting is not really very positive.  Rebick: That's not how I read it. At least  that's not true in Toronto. What I've seen has  been quite positive actually. The problem is  the questioning of our process [of choosing  a president.] And that is entirely because she  is a women of colour. One article in The Globe  and Mail basically said the NAC executive  decided no one should run against Sunera  because she is a woman of colour. That isn't  true at all. The reporter drew his own conclusions but has since admitted his mistake.  And people took that and used it.  Then came the attackby John McDougall  [an Ontario MP who asked the federal government in Parliament why it funded an  organization that had chosen an "illegal  immigrant" as its next president. Thobani is  a landed immigrant and has never been an  "illegal immigrant." The media has since  played up the issue] [see Kinesis, May 93.]  I believe [this issue] is a smoke screen  for backlash. There is a tremendous backlash against the presence women of colour  are starting to have in the women's movement and Sunera's going to be a target of  that, there is no question about it.  But I don't see [the coverage] as entirely  negative. The fact she's getting the profile,  that there is an interest in her, is positive. It  shows the media considers NAC a force to  be reckoned with. The content of it has certainly been mixed but, over all, it's turning  out OK. Certainly in the women's movement, the feedback we're getting from our  member groups is overwhelmingly positive.  Huang: Judy Rebick has pretty big shoes  to fill. What do you think are the major  challenges for Sunera, in that she's following the legacy of Judy Rebick?  Rebick: Regionalization. Wealso have to  keep up our profile in the media. 1 think  our strength. I think Sunera is good at bringing people together.  The big challenge for us now is to take  the work we did through the referendum  into the upcoming elections, and to make  sure the election campaign is based in the  regions, while keeping a national profile.  It'll be much more difficult for Sunera  personally than it was for me because of the  racism and because she has to prove herself  in a way I never had to. Yet, let's face it, she's  far more representative of Canadian women  than I wa s when I beca mepresidentofN AC:  I had a Trotskyist background; I've never  been married; I don't have kids; and I've  been on the fringes politically most of my  life.  Sunera isa pioneer ina waylneverwas.  The expectation is on her to maintain the  profile, the power and, at the same time,  break through the colour barrier. I think she  needs a lot of support. A lot of women are  committed to supporting her and she may  be able to accomplish what I wasn't able to,  which is to make the collective process more  visible publicly.  But because she's very different than I  am, people aren't going to expect her to be  like me. That's an advantage. The way she  presents herself is very different. So people  can't expect her to be a Judy Rebick clone...  Jaffer: ...even though that, in a sense, is  what some women want?  Rebick: Yes, but I resisted staying on as  president because I thought it was the wrong  thing precisely because so many people think  what has happened in NAC is because of  me. I believe a change is taking place globally in the women's movement. It's full of  the hope of humanity, globally. And as capitalism becomes more and more savage, as  it's becoming, and more and more centralized, it is women who are going to challenge  that.  Huang: So, Judy, you're at the AGM  standing on the podium. Someone has just  handed you a dozen roses. You are about to  make your farewell speech...  Rebick: I feel like I'm dead already, you  know (laughter). Suddenly everyone is paying tribute to me.  Huang: You tip your tiara to all the  women you want to thank...  Rebick: (Laughter) But I sold my se-  quined shoes. NAC auctioned them off.  Jaffer: ...to pay for the No campaign?  (Laughter)  Huang: ...and you're about to say what  your vision for NAC and its role is in the  future of the women's movement.  Rebick: What I guess I would talk about  is I think NAC has to continue to be an  alternate voice in politics, right now especially. We've resisted the right-wing in lots  of ways but they have ideological hegemony  right now—with their deficit hysteria, their  notion we can't afford social programs anymore, and so on.  NAC has to continue to fight in coalition  with other progressive groups like unions,  the environmental movement, the anti-racist  movement, the Aboriginal movement and  others. The stakes are enormously high globally. The right-wing is trying to drive us  back to the conditions of the industrial revolution. We have to make much more global  links and that's the biggest challenge, especially with limited resources.  Capitalists are completely coordinated  on a global level—they've got the money to  do it. The only global force that can oppose  them effectively is the women's movement.  ' Unions are doing it too, but women are on  the front lines of resistance everywhere fighting this attempt to turn back the clock for  . masses of people.  Also, the establishment understands the  power of the women's movement in a way  that they didn't before. They are responding  to this with the "Kim Campbells" of the  world. Women like that are going to become  our most bitter opponents.  HuangA've noticed there's this assumption that feminists are going to support  Campbell and if we say we don't, they think  we're being "contrary."  Rebick: That's right. The line is: NAC is  dividing the women's movement and is alienating white, middle-class women. That  comes from the perception that if we focus  on the issues of the most disadvantaged  women, we're being divisive. Women like  Campbell will claim to represent women  and say NAC doesn't. That's the new way  they are going to try to marginalize us.  Jaffer: What do you see as the greatest  triumphs, personally and politically, over  the last three years?  Rebick: The most difficult thing for me  was what happened around the Canadian  Panel on Violence because I fucked up in the  beginning. I was wrong.  The process around the new rape law  [Bill C-49 where women's groups came together in consultations with Campbell] was  reallya triumph because the violenceagainst  women movement had been divided in so  many directions. It all came together around  the rape law consultations and the Canadian  Panel on Violence. Those are the political  triumphs for the women's movement, and  for NAC.  Personally, the referendum was a triumph because I learned in a profound way  what collective leadership meant. I couldn't  have done what I did as an individual. The  triumph was using my skills at the service of  the collective and with the wisdom of the  collective. It was about being a real feminist  leader.  [The referendum] was also about the  process we went through as a women's  movement, which we don't talk about  enough, and about the strength of the Native  women, who pushed us to take that position  in the end. They were so tough at times when  we were ready to compromise, but we  couldn't because they wouldn't. It was an  amazing thing. I want to write about it because what was visible is a very small part of  what was happening.  Agnes Huang and Fatima Jaffer cut this  interview down from 18,150 words to 3,800  ivords, but if they'd had their way, they'd  have run the whole thing! Stay tuned for  Rebick's book.  JUNE 1993  11 100,000  Interview with Ellen Woodsworth  N  NA  1  as told to Fatima Jaffer  A High on the Hill: Caroline Langdon from  Toronto, co-ordinator of Voice of Women  Canada, the oldest women's liberation group  in Canada and Stella Legohn from Winnipeg  from  groups,  to the  RagingGrannies,  theatre groups,  women from church organizations, from every sector you can imagine.  I believe the most important role the caravan played was to say: this is  what a democratic movement is about, it's about representing all sectors in  Canadian society, letting us say what we want, and providing informa tion so  we can make informed decisions about the kind of future we want.  The caravan stands for the total opposite of NAFTA. This "agreement"  was drafted in secret by representatives of big corporations. It creates a body  of legislation that overrides democratically elected governments. Once it  passes, the people of Canada will not have any access to those bodies—the  _ ". , —«—»- NAFTA commissions will not  be elected by us and we will  not be able to question their  decisions. However, corporations will be able to do so. So  the caravan was the antithesis  of that. It brought democracy  back to the grassroots.  Many had travelled across the country on the On to Ottawa caravan, which  left Courtenay, BC in the West and St. John's, Newfoundland in the East, on April  18. Ellen Woodsivorth joined the Caravan in its trek from Vancouver to Calgary. In  May, she flew to Ottawa to join demonstrators on the Hill. Woodsivorth is co-chair  of the BC Action Canada Network [a coalition of progressive groups opposing the  NAFTA] and works with Women to Women Global Strategies. Kinesis spoke with  Woodsworth last month.  Going mobile with NAFTA  It was great to be on the caravan with another lesbian feminist, Miche Hill  [of the Vancouver Status of Women], as a reference point for other women.  Women would come up to us, and they would speak out—our presence there  seemed to enable women to speak about issues they probably wouldn't have  otherwise. The big thing people wanted was information. Most of the people  we met have a sense NAFTA is going to gut the country but don't know the  details or how to fight back.  In British Columbia, we stopped in places like Hope, Penticton, Kamloops, Quesnel, Dawson Creek...In Grand Forks, BC, we stopped in front of  the Overwaitea [Supermarket], set up and started handing out leaflets. This  woman and her husband pulled up in a pick-up truck, handed us $20 and  said, "we can't do anything more, but please take this." Other people gave us  coffee and doughnuts. Some people came up to us and said, thank god we  a, were doing what we were doing. It was just great.  E In Penticton, a pensioner came up to us. She said the passing of the North  ~Z American Free Trade Agreement will mean her death! She said she couldn't  5 afford the medication she needs now, and she was going to die because of the  •2" passage of Bill C-91, which is locked in under NAFTA. [Bill C-91 is the new  o drug patent law passed last February, which extends patent protection for  °- drug companies to 20 years, limiting the manufacture of cheaper, generic  versions]. The woman said it has raised the cost of the medication she needs to  live.  Everywhere we went, there were large numbers of women out, playing  strong leadership roles—everything from a singing group in Castlegar, BC,  to key speakers  Lucia Spencer of the National Organization  of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women  speaks to the crowd  Feeling Fantastic: Ellen  Woodsworth, of Woman to  Woman Global Strategies, co-  chair of the BCACN and Jean  Swanson, representing the National Anti-Poverty Organization,  ecstatic at the tremendous power  of the thousands and thousands  of people...  On to Ottawa...  > There were people who  i came [to Parliament Hill] by  > bus—it took some of them 48  : hours to get to Ottawa. People  I came on planes, took the train  \ up, people came from Que-  *" bee, from Newfoundland, from Dawson Creek, from Vancouver Island—over 900 buses  came in from Ontario alone. You could not buy a train ticket into Ottawa. Plane loads of  people and hundreds of cars were pouring into Ottawa.  As you looked out on to the crowd, you could see the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women banner, the Voice of Women Canada's banner, placards with lesbian  organizations, seniors' organizations, farmers' organizations—it really was a broad cross-  section of people.  When we started to converge on the Hill, the first thing we saw was a large "graveyard"  with a gateway with a sign that said: "Here lie all the people from... whose factories have  closed since the Free Trade Agreement." As you walked in, there was an open coffin with the  costume of a dead beaver in it. Behind were rows upon rows of gravestones, each representing  a factory that had closed in Ontario—Niagra Falls, Welland, Peterborough... If we had had  Electrifying the Crowd: NAC's Judy Rebick in action. "She got everyone yelling and shoputing what  they felt about NAFTA and this country...." says Ellen Woodsworth. "There was a tremendous surge on  energy that enervated everyone on Parliment Hill as we chanted together."  a graveyard representing all the factories the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has cost Canada, it probably  would have taken up all the space on Parliament Hill. We've lost over 500,000 jobs since the FTA.  People kept marching in so that the whole square of Parliament Hill, as far as you could see in any  direction, was filled with thousands of people, representing a powerful social movement.  For me, it was a turning point for the future of Canada. It gave me a sense of taking the country  back from the Tory agenda and laying out what our people's agenda is. Whether or not NAFTA goes  through in Canada, there's a strong social movement here—and in the US and Mexico—that's working  really hard to stop NAFTA. And I think we can stop it.  But we have to continue to build a strong social movement because, even if NAFTA is defeated  in the US, the corporations will redraft it in a new form. We have to keep fighting back. We can't get  paralyzed by how strong these corporations are because they're not as strong as over 100,000 people  on Parliament Hill.  The latest on NAFTA  If the North American Free Trade Agreement goes  through, we're looking at the establishment of a commission that we cannot go to to fight for women's rights as we  have gone to the provincial, municipal, and federal governments to get rights to jobs, human rights, pay equity,  childcare programs. Any rights we've won, we've basically won from elected government organizations.  After NAFTA, our elected officials will not be able to  respond to pressure from us because they will be overridden by this commission. We will see hundreds of thousands more jobs lost, and those will be women's jobs. As  for the new jobs that will be created, we already know that  97 per cent of the new jobs created since the FTA have been  low-paying, no-benefit, contract-type ones. We will also  seea tremendous increase in the destruction of the environment as the profit motive runs the economic agenda in this  country and environmental concerns get tossed out the  window.  The parallel accord—the sidebar agreements that are  being developed right now—are basically being developed by the right wing within the United States. There are  three areas: to protect American workers; to protect the  environment; and to protect against import surges. All  three of those protectionist proposals are bad for the  Mexicans and for Canadians.  In the US, billionaire Ross Perot, who's right wing, is  fighting the NAFTA. On the other hand, women are fighting it because they'reconcerned from the progressive point  of view. The right and the left are battling to defeat  NAFTA—it's similar to what happened in Canada during  the referendum on the constitutional amendments, with  both the right-wing and progressives on the 'No' side.  Sunera Thobani of NAC: "We don't  want a government that will experiment with the lives of poor  people...we know when there isn't  adequate provision of services, the  burden falls on women."  There's a good chance that NAFTA will be defeated in the US, but  that doesn't mean we can stop watching what happens at the  national and the international levels. The transnational corporations  are working day and night to restructure the world economy for  profit and women have to make sure that doesn't happen. NAFTA  has gone through third reading in the House of Commons.  The history of Canada shows there should have been extensive  cross-country committees discussing the issues, and it should have  gone into debate in the House for weeks or months. But the House  agreed on forced closure—that is, the Speaker of the House forces a  vote on it and, because the Conservatives have the majority, they can  carry it through. This basically limits debate. And because the Tories  have stacked the Senate and have a majority, they can run it through  the Senate as well.  We have to sign NAFTA on January 1,1994. If NAFTA passes  in the US, it still has to be ratified in all three countries on January 1,  1995. So if we elect, say, a minority NDP government federally, or  even a minority Liberal government with the NDP having a certain  number of votes, we could actually block signage of the NAFTA  i it on January 1 st. Or we could put tremendous pressure on  a Tory government politically and block  signage.  In the US, the side deals presently being  negotia ted are being opposed by the Canad i-  ans and the Mexicans. If the side deals open  up N AFTA significantly, it would lead to the  reopening of the discussion on the NAFTA  agreement—there'd be such significant  changes, the NAFTA would have to be renegotiated.  Building a social movement  We in the Action Canada Network want  to build the most powerful social movement  the country's ever seen and base it on the  principles of democracy. That is the only  thing that is going to stand in the way of  corporations taking over this country.  I feel powerful because I know that I  come out of a strong social movement—the  women's movement. The key breakthrough during the referendum was that the women's movement was critical in defeating the amendments drafted by the present federal government and political parties. It was a kind of coming of age for  the women's movement in Canada where—in small groups,  individually and in large organizations—we had the analysis  and took leadership. And it was the critical leadership of the  Aboriginal women's movement that made us do that. I don't  think we've looked back since.  We've built the leadership to ensure we are able to determine the political future of Canada. And we're able to do that  internationally because we've been able to globalize our ana lysis. We know if 240 women are locked into a factory in  Thailand and die, it's directly related to the economic and  political policies of our country. We can no longer limit  ourselves to strictly local, provincial or national issues. We  have to work on a global level to move in a democratic movement. We are not the only  ones—people's movements everywhere are building links globally and we have to be  a part of that.  The key women speakers at the rally in Ottawa were feminists taking the  leadership. Social movements are beginning to recognize it's not just women taking  leadership, but women who are feminists. And we're going to need good feminist  leadership to set the stage for the upcoming federal elections. Because if "the young Ms.  Thatcher" [Kim Campbell] wins the Conservative Party leadership race, there's going  to be confusion in some women's minds that she's going to show something new and  different from Brian Mulroney when, in fact, her politics differ very little from his.  We have to continue to show that a feminist perspective represents a  different vision for Canada—not that of the rich and the elite, but of working  women who are seeking a society where we can have paid work, good social  programs, and a healthy environment.  Meanwhile, in Vancouver...  Demonstrations against NAFTA were held simultaneously across the  country on May 15. In Vancouver, an energetic crowd of about 500 women,  children and men gathered outside the Trade and Convention Centre downtown to hear speakers from the Action Canada Network and to protest the  government and corporate agendas.  People chanted "NAFTA, NAFTA, We  don't hafta," some wore T-shirts with home-  madeslogans proclaiming "Weareenemies  of Kim's Canada," most carried Stop signs  that said, "Stop Free Trade."  "This caravan has been a symbol of  hope for all of us," Sunera Thobani of the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women told the crowd. "It has brought  together comm unities of people everywhere  who realize our lives, equality rights and  employment opportunities are being eroded  by the policies of this Tory government and  we say, 'absolutely no way! Enough is  enough'."  Miche Hill of the Vancouver Status of  Women also spoke. She said her organization was proud to be part of a coalition "to  boot those Tories out, get rid of this free  trade deal and stop NAFTA, and once and  for all, to bring the power back to the people  where it belongs and allow us to make the  decisions about what we want to do in this  country."  Taking Parliament Hill: 3,000 miles later, the Action  Canada's Network's "vehicle of democracy" leads in  over 900 buses and no-one-knows-how-many cars  for a massive demonstration on Parliment Hill to  oppose the NAFTA  Miche Hill of VSW: "This guy came  up to us on the caravan and asked  for more information about what we  were doing. And he said, 'I've been  looking at this free trade stuff for a  while and all I've got to say is that  bloody government is just a bunch  of treasonous people up there.'  And I'm telling you, that's what  people think all the way across this  country."  Anti-NAFTA demonstrators outside the Trade and Convention  Centre in Vancouver  KINESIS  JUNE 1993  KINESIS Commentary  Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies:  The farce  continues...  by Gwen Basen  Let the buyer beware!  That was the best Patricia Baird and her  Royal Commission on the New Reproductive Technologies could say to women last  month when they released their survey of  Canadian infertility clinics.  As a piece of research, the report is an  embarrassment, providing no useful data  about the practices of fertility programs in  this country. Baird announced that Canadian centres do a very poor job of recordkeeping, and that there is a wide variation in  the standards of practice, putting women  and the babies they must have at risk. This is  hardly news!  The experimental natureof fertility technologies and the low success rates were two  major reasons for demanding the creation of  the Commission in the first instance, and  that was in 1989. And now, with this study,  after four years and $25 million, the best Dr.  Baird can do is to tell women they need to  ask a lot of questions!  Her performance continues to raise some  very troubling concerns about this Commission and its responsibility to the Canadian  public.  Last month, we heard about possible  HIV infection from artificial insemination,  but they would not name the doctors who  may be responsible. And what of the other  unethical practices revealed in the report?  Almost half of the centres with artificial  insemination programs have no limits on  the number of inseminations they will do  using a single donor. A recent mainstream  newspaper account reports that one student  sold sperm to a Montreal clinic 200 times in  two years. And since each ejaculation is  divided into many separate inseminations,  he may well be the biological father of hundreds of babies.  Carefully guided by the Commission,  every media outlet in the country took the  same "spin" on the "story" and focused on  the deadly risk of contracting HIV. They  completely ignored the other potentially lethal outcomes for women and children buried in the pages of the survey.  Lately, Baird herself has begun to publicly raise questions about the safety and  efficacy of these technologies. But she continues to ask Canadians to wait for her report  and recommendations. In 1992, the Commission requested an extension of more than  six months to complete their final report,  now due in July.  How are we to understand this irresponsibility? The risks associated with the  reproductive technologies havealready been  well documented. In 1990, a World Health  Organization report stated that "...there has  not been adequate research on the short term  and long term risks associated with IVF (in  vitro fertilization)." It described the limited  effectiveness of IVF—fewer than ten live  births per 100 treatment cycles—and pointed  out the serious health risks to women taking  ovulation stimulation drugs,a standard part  of IVF and other fertility treatments. The  report documented a perinatal mortality rate  for IVF babies of four times that of the general population.  An Australian report, published in 1987  by the Director of the National Perinatal  Statistics Unit, notes that some kind of congenital malformations occur more frequently  than expected in Australian IVF pregnancies. Data from France gathered between  1989 and 1991 shows that the spontaneous  abortion rate of IVF pregnancies is double,  the multiple birth rate 22 times as high, and  the Caesarean birth rate seven times higher  than in normal conception.  There was never any reason to assume  that Canadian findings would be signifi  cantly different. Why didn't the Commission warn us about these risks years ago, at  the beginning of their mandate?  Most of this data was presented to the  Com mission by women's groups such as the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC), the Vancouver Reproductive Technologies Committee and DES Action, during public hearings almost three  years ago. Baird has now seen fit to grant  legitimacy to some of these health dangers.  Why has it taken her so long? Why wasn't  the demand for a moratorium on the expansion of IVF, put forward by NAC and other  women's groups, acted on?  The Commission has sat back and allowed the media to make a circus event out  of these serious concerns, as the "heartless  feminists" were pitted against the "long-  suffering infertile." The mainstream press  continues to ignore the problematic aspects  of these technologies and forges on with the  presentation of rVF as a medical miracle.  Just last month the Toronto papers ran photos of a room full of smiling couples and  children at an IVF clinic's birthday celebration. But if they were to take a photo of all the  women who have gone through long years  of treatment without a healthy baby to show  for it, they would need a considerably larger  room!  Baird claims to be alarmed by the findings of the survey but continues to do nothing, leaving the onus on the couples in the  clinics to "ask questions". Meanwhile, the  Federal government says it isn't up to the  provinces to control these technologies, and  a spokesperson in the Ontario Ministry of  Health said it was up to the doctors themselves! [see Kinesis, Oct. 92].  But what kind of answers can women  expect to get from doctors who are lying? Let  the Commission ask the doctors: why are  they not following guidelines set up by their  own societies? Why are they refusing to  report their success rates to their own professional organizations? Why are they not  providing adequate information to their  patients on both the known and potential  risks of these technologies? Could it have  something to do with the large economic  gains in this field for doctors and the drug  companies who push this technological control of procreation?  IVF has transformed the very practice of  medicine. No longer are doctors healing and  curing human beings. Now they are fabricating human life itself. The techniques developed to improve the success rate of IVF,  such as ova stimulation and embryo freezing, have led to the production of thousands  of "surplus" embryos. Around the world,  these embryos are being used in cancer research, to develop contraceptives, and being  studied for use in grafts and transplants. The  embryo has been transformed into experimental material, completely changing our  way of thinking about human life.  This access to the embryo has opened  the way for genetic diagnosis and eventual  manipulation of the embryo. Pre-implantation diagnosis, the genetic evaluation of the  embryo before it is transferred back to a  woman has brought eugenic ["improving"  hereditary qualities of genes for better offspring] selection into human procreation.  The Commission drags on, asking us to wait,  while the technology forges ahead. We already have one clinic in Canada—at the  University Hospital in London, Ontario—  getting ready to begin a preimplantation  diagnosis program. And this without any  public discussion or debate.  The Commission has focused public  attention on the scandal of IVF infection and  delinquent doctors who don't follow the  rules. They claim that regulation will solve  these problems.  But it is time to end the masquerade of  the reproductive technologies as medical  treatment. After 25 years, the failure rate  remains dramatic, and there has been no  evaluation of the long-term effectiveness or  effects of these procedures. Let's recognize  them for what they really are: experiments  on women and children. At the same time as  these technologies multiply, our society continues to create infertility as a by-product of  sexually transmitted disease, environmental pollution, workplace hazards and our  social and political structures.  More than a year and a half ago, four of  the original Commissioners were fired by  the prime minister's office after they had  claimed that the Commission was not respecting the terms of the act under which it  was created. The Commission's shoddy research program and its refusal to reveal  information was criticized by women's legal, academic and grassroots groups who  called for it to be disbanded [see Kinesis, Feb.  921  This latest episode is only the most recent in the long history of irresponsibility of  this Commission. It does not have the credibility and the trust needed to investigate the  risks associated with these technologies or to  organize a regulatory body. The Canadian  public must not be hoodwinked into thinking that the federal government is safeguarding the health of women and children or the  future of human procreation.

Commentary  "Stopping the Violence "& sexual assault centres:  Co-opting centres  by Johannah Pilot  As a feminist, active in the fight to end  male violence against women, I am disappointed and discouraged by what I judge to  be the severe limitations of the provincial  NDP government's "Stopping the Violence"  initiatives. The project was launched by the  Ministry of Women's Equality last year, in  response to the BC Task Force on Family  Violence Report, 7s Anyone Listening?.  Many feminist front-line workers have  expressed hope that this NDP government  will act on our calls for maintaining feminist  standards of front-line anti-violence work.  We also expected that concerns raised with  the NDP government about inherent flaws  in a "Victim Assistance" approach to women's service would be addressed. In essence,  we demanded that this government actively  reverse government and institutional trends  aimed at demolishing feminist standards of  work by imposing "law and order" and  "mental health" agendas, and give us back  the power to make decisions about our work  and how to carry it out.  Feminist front-line anti-violence work  is unique and crucial because it is directly  based on the experiences and needs of  women, and ultimately strives toward liberating all women from male terrorism. For  our work to be effective, it must be carried  out with the least amount of government  and institutional control and interference.  Well, the money is being disbursed and  the contracts a re being signed—and the q ues-  tions remain: are women who are targeted  through male violence and the feminists  who stand with them any better off as a  result of these initiatives? Has the NDP truly  listened and taken direction from individual  women and their advocates to determine the  direction and implementation of these initiatives? I don't think so.  What we got is really nothing new or  progressive. We have the same old problems of institutional and government takeover under the guise of a "counselling for  women" wrapping.  I draw on my experience a s a rape crisis  worker with Women Against Violence  Against Women (WAVAW) in Vancouver  when I look at some of the "counselling"  program contracts under these initiatives,  and talk with feminist front-line recipients  of the funding.  I want to critique this initiative in terms  of how much autonomy it actually provides  feminist services—that is, how much control  do we have over our work, our membership,  and our organizational structures. I'll begin  with some historical background on the funding initiatives carried out by the previous  government.  Just another "VAP" initiative?  Theonsetof Victim Assistance Programs  (VAPs) in 1987 coincided with women's  criticisms of the criminal justice system and  government's failure to respond to women's  calls for assistance and progressive change.  VAPs were designed to promote the use of  the criminal justice system without changing it. Their implementation created the  illusion that the government was responding to violence against women. There are  essentially two forms of VAPs: systems-  based, such as police and crown-based, are  directly linked to the criminal justice system,  and employ a "law and order" approach to  victims of crime; Specialized VAPs (SVAPs),  on theother hand, differ from systems-based  VAPs in that they have a focus on "emotional support" and are located in the community. Both differ from many existing femi  nist services, because of the absence of explicit feminist advocacy and a vision of social change.  Before the onset of VAPs, sexual assault  centres were funded under sexual assault  centre contracts with the Attorney General  (AG) and were separate from VAPs. Sexual  assault centre contracts were not under the  law and order umbrella of VAPs, they focused specifically on women and violence,  and they recognized advocacy as part of the  work.  Since 1982, however, not only has there  been no increase in government funding  allocated to the few remaining sexual assault centre contracts, but with the push  towards VAPs, new funding to sexual assault centres was provided under the law  and order umbrella of VAPs in the form of  SVAPs.  Contracting through SVAPs introduced  a direct link to the criminal justice system by:  encouraging reporting to police, eliminating  advocacy work, and bringing centres' data  If you want to kill an  autonomous social  movement, one way to  do it is to change the  conditions of its  funding.  collection under the de-gendered victims of  crime data collection. This means that feminist services and women's experiences of  male violence fall under the category of  "victims of crime"—degendering women's  experiences, our work and our demands for  change.  WAVAW received its first SVAP funding in 1988 in the form of a grant and then in  1988-89 received its first SVAP funding contract. When I was negotiating these contracts at WAVAW with the AG, I found that  no amount of lobbying or protest would  convince them that new funding should go  through the sexual assault centre contract.  They argued the need for "standardization"  of services and increased "accountability"  and "coordination" of programs—specialized contracts would serve those ends, they  claimed. Clearly, a political decision to bring  WAVAW and other feminist services under  VAP. Its no wonder that many of us believed the AG's efforts to redefine our purpose, work and goals were a direct attack on  our autonomy.  VAPs have expanded to more than 100  programs throughout the province—54 are  police based, 30 are community based  (Specialized Victim Assistance Programs-  SV APs), eight are crown-based, and nine are  corrections-victim-offender reconciliation  programs.  Eventually, the few remaining centres  funded as sexual assault centres will become  obsolete, as a result of the AG's funding  criteria and data collection. In addition, the  government can falsely claim they are providing women's services when really what  they are offering to women is the expansion  of a law-and-order agenda. If you want to  kill an autonomous social movement, one  way to do it is to change the conditions of  funding.  To add fuel to the fire, around the same  time, the AG announced they would no  longer fund annual general meetings of  sexual assault centres in BC. They suggested  instead they would provide money for some  future grouping of SVAPs. As a result, we  saw the formation of the Association of Specialized Victim Assistance Programs in 1991.  This association has a strong counselling  focus and has goals of standardizing and  professionalizing "victims of crime" work.  Some of us opposed the formation of  this association, arguing instead for the protection and solidification of feminist rape  crisis centres. At the time, WAVAW, and  later, Rape Relief, intentionally did not become members of this association. I worry  that this association, which is still funded by  the Attorney General and Secretary of State  Women's Programs, will solidify and  strengthen the la w and order umbrella of the  "victim assistance movement"—a force I  suggest we actively resist if our goal is to  work for social change in the interests of  women.  I am also alarmed that the NDP is beginning to view this association as the official  voice for sexual assault centres in this province—during recent consultations for the  Korbin Commission (set up to restructure  the government's financial relationships with  the public sector), the association was invited to participate under the name, the BC  Association of Sexual Assault Centres. Is  this a misleading typo or an indication the  NDP sees the association as the official voice  of all sexual assault centres? WAVAW and  Rape Relief were not part of the association  and therefore were not invited to participate  as sexual assault centres.  Stopping the Violence?  The crucial point here is tha t the government's new initiative, "Stopping the Violence," does nothing to enhance feminist  standards of front-line work or to eliminate  the flaws of the SVAP co-option.  Even though the counselling programs  under the "Stopping the Violence" initiative  have not been launched directly under the  name "victim assistance," it is my analysis  that the exclusive counselling focus of this  initiative fits into the mandate and philosophy of SVAPs like a designer glove.  I want to address the $4 million, out of  the $10 million total, that went to counselling programs. Existing and new feminist  centres are receiving funding for counselling which requires them to provide: counselling that assesses the individual's situation; counselling that will go beyond emotional support but will not constitute clinical  treatment; and counselling that should take  account of social, cultural and economic  values which hinder recovery and may promote powerlessness, re-victimization and  dependency. Crucial here is that the minimum required training for counsellors is  high school graduation and related post-  secondary education through undergraduate degree programs or community college  diploma programs.  While I do not question the need for  direct support services for women, I question funding exclusively allocated for "counselling." I further question the valuing of  traditional and quasi-professional counselling models over feminist peer support models, which focus on empowerment and  change.  The women's liberation movement has  consistently struggled to resist the pro-  fessionalization and therapization of vio  lence against women. Why? Because professionals and institutions have failed to provide protection and assistance to women,  and women need and deserve more than a  piecemeal solution, focused on "fixing" the  individual woman—we need to continue  working toward eliminating the social constructs that perpetuate male power. And we  fail to see how the growth of a therapeutic/  mental health industry—that has greatly  "Stopping the  Violence," does nothing  to enhance feminist  standards of front-line  work or to eliminate the  flaws of the SVAP  co-option.  MmHffmtrTO  profited and expanded on the backs of  women—benefits individual women and  groups of women.  I also understand that recipients of this  funding are required to attend the Justice  Institute's clinical training for counsellors.  After reading the manual for this training, I  am discouraged by its highly clinical orientation, and the near absence of grassroots  feminist perspective. Does this mean feminist front-line organizations—who have been  and continue to be instrumental in providing support, assistance and advocacy to  women, and who continue to work for long-  term political change—are expected to become "qualified professionals" trained in  the "fineart" of therapeutic soluiions? Does  this mean we are expected to leave women  in the hands of mental health professionals?  Work, structure and membership  What happened to our demands of the  NDP government to have feminist organizations recognized and funded for advocacy  work? What happened to our demands for  maintaining feminist standards of peer relations and peer support? What happened to  our demands that were documented by the  BC Task Force on Family Violence, which  supposedly guided this funding initiative  by government?  Having been a rape crisis worker, I  know women need more than counselling;  individual women often need advocacy in  theirdealings withtheman/men who abused  them, the police, the courts, social services  and housing, and women need and want  agents who actively educate, lobby, and organize to change the social conditions under  which we are forced to live. This is part of  our work as feminist front-line workers.  I have seen many job postings for new  positions under this initiative from centres  seeking to employ specialized professionals. Some were even seeking counsellors  who have experience working with men.  Other centres, as a condition of funding,  are required to "coordinate" with victim  assistance programs. Still others are being  obliged to reserve seats for police and crown  counsel on their advisory boards.  See VICTIM ASSISTANCE page 16 ^  JUNE 1993 Commentary  Deaf and hard-of-hearing women:  Access at  WAVAW  by Tanis Doe and Fawzia Ahmad  Violenceagainstwomenaffects women  from diverse backgrounds. It is one of the  most serious problems facing women, and  one that generates the most solidarity among  women fighting back. Yet, while women  from every income level and culture can be  survivors of physical, sexual and psychological abuse, its impact can be most severe  for the most vulnerable. Women who cannot  defend themselves for many reasons are  terrorized and assaulted by men with  power—sometimes their husbands, sometimes their doctors, sometimes strangers,  but always by someone who knows they  have few alternatives.  Domestic workers, women in isolated  areas and women living in institutions are  among the most likely to be trapped in  abusive situations. Yet there is too little said,  written or done in mainstream culture to  recognize and address the specific dangers  these women face.  We work at a rape crisis centre in Vancouver and are drawing on our experiences  there to talk about how and why rape crisis  centres are moving towards becoming truly  "inclusive"—an inclusion of specific groups  of women who have systemically been excluded in the past.  Women with disabilities are more likely  to be abused than non-disabled women.  Regardless of the type of disability, most  women with disabilities are forced to depend on various professionals, which makes  them particularly vulnerable to exploitation  by these professionals. Across the country,  women with disabilities have tried to work  within and outside the women's movement  to improve safety and access to support.  There are a number of rape crisis centres  in the women's movement that offer sup-  CANADA'S ONLY FEMINIST  HEALTH MAGAZINE!

One such  organization is the Vancouver-based Women  Against Violence Against Women/Rape  Crisis Centre (WAVAW). We work at  WAVAW.  As a feminist organization, the collective at WAVAW is committed to addressing  issues of class, race, homophobia, ableism  and sexism within its training program for  because she was deaf and could not speak,  the judge ruled that the accused could not  have understood her resistance.  It's become obvious that sexual and  physical abuse are serious concerns in the  deaf community. Adding to the isolation  that results from attending residential schools  for most of their school lives, deaf people  often can only communicate with those who  share their language.  American Sign Language (ASL), a language used by most deaf people, is not  generally known by hearing people. It's only  recently that professional interpreters have  come forward to translate between English  and ASL. Deaf women who may be subjected to violence within the deaf community are isolated and often unable to seek  help due to the inaccessibility of services and  the issues of confidentiality that are present  within marginalised communities. Deaf  women who are assaulted by strangers are  equally unable to get help because of the lack  of services available to them at rape crisis  centres, particularly staff who can communicate with them.  Hard-of-hearing women experience  similar communication difficulties, even  Michele Greenaway, Krista Lefler and member of the media (l-r)  volunteers. Yet, despite the fact that services  are provided to any woman who asks for  them, there are limitations.  In this article we want to address some  of the limitations to access to services experienced by deaf and hard-of-hearing women.  Imagine being assaulted and not being  able to call for help. This was a fact of life  years ago when there were no telephones,  and when there were no crisis lines. Yet,  even today, some women still cannot call for  help, at least not with a regular phone. Deaf  women and hard-of-hearing women who  don't communicate over the phone are unable to reach many crisis centres including  WAVAW. Yet, deaf and hard-of-hearing  women are being assaulted and are at risk.  And it goes beyond crisis centres—we know  one Native woman Who was assaulted, but  when they do not use sign language. Not  being able to hear conversations clearly creates added tensions for women in crisis.  When in crisis, hearing women often miss  what is being said to them and have to  attempt to answer questions they did not  hear correctly—this iscompounded for hard-  of-hearing women.  Like most rape crisis centres, WAVAW  provides services primarily in two ways—  on the phone and in person. To make these  services available to deaf and hard-of-hearing women, the collective decided it needed  to change the way services were provided.  Hard-of-hearing women have been a part of  the WAVAW collective over the last 11 years  now. Yet, because of the lack of education  around deaf and hard-of-hearing women's  needs and an unwillingness and inability for  various reasons to prioritize accessibility to  those women, they leave the organization.  WAVAW has put funds into awareness  training for volunteers and into providing  interpreters at rallies and public events. We  also recieved funds to purchase a telephone  device for the deaf. The TTY is a keyboard  device that allows typed communication to  be transmitted over phone lines. (In order to  communicate, there must be a TTY at both  ends.)  We also received funding from the BC  Ministry of Women's Equality to carry out a  needs assessment project.  Several other actions are being planned  as part of the project. A dedicated TTY line is  being set up for business hours so that the  TTY will always be answered, and this  number will be widely publicized. A system  is being developed to allow women using a  TTY to call workers who are on-call after  hours. Interpreters are being trained, and  will be made available to deaf and hard-of-  hearing women who require them, and all  WAVAW services available to deaf and hard-  of-hearing women will be made accessible.  Some specific training will be provided  to health and legal professionals and interpreters, and to message-relay operators, to  ensure that deaf women are able to access  the services of hospitals and those of police  investigations, should they choose to do so.  Deaf and hard-of-hearing women are  part of the needs assessment project, and  have identified the necessity of workshops  on date rape, family violence, and self-de-  £   fence as priorities for their communities.  "J Our organization has made a commit-  Jj   ment to make an effort to ensure that the  "2   needs of women who are deaf or hard-of-  ■£   hearing are met through services in the com-  o   m unity and by the collective. The project has  °- limited funding but we are confident the  motivation of the collective members is not  limited.  Clearly there is no group immune from  violence against women—yet thereare many  who are less likely to seek and receive support. We, in the feminist community, must  make efforts beyond our day-to-day work to  include those least likely to participate—and  one place to reach out is to women who are  segregated by language barriers.

Manitoba  VICTIM ASSISTANCE from page 15  Must we pretend that coordination and  cooperation with such conservative forces  will help end male violence?  The problem of specialized and professionalized counselling problem will undoubtedly impact on the structure and internal operations of the few collective and semi-  collective organizations that remain by  throwing a wedge between collective members, endangering collective structures and  ways of work. Hierarchy and bureaucracy  could become the order of the day in the  name of educational and professional standards.  The issue of membership is also critical.  The counselling contracts I have reviewed  require that service providers undergocrimi-  nal-record checks. This is a new membership requirement imposed by government.  Criminal record checks are unnecessary  because we don't have men in our organizations, and because we have our own criteria  for determining women's ability and com  mitment to support other women. It is most  often women who are charged with crimes  of poverty (that is, fraud, solicitation, and so  on).  Socially and legally sanctioned poverty  may be the government's criteria for determining a woman's "suitability" to do this  work—it should never be ours. It is has been  my experience that such funding requirements and manipulations not only make our  work more arduous, but also directly limit  our control over provision of services, our  membership, and our organizational structures. To accept these conditions uncritically  leaves us at risk of losing our autonomy.  It really doesn't matter if it is a "law and  order" agenda or a "therapeutic" agenda. In  the end, all women will lose—just the same  old problems with new wrappings. Let the  struggle continue.  Johamiah Pilot worked with WAVAW for  three years and continues in her commitment and struggle to eradicate male  violence against women. Arts  Jamelie Hassan and Jamila Ismail:  Doubling identities  I  by Larissa Lai  THE JAMELIEJAMILA PROJECT:  A COLLABORATIVE BOOKWORK  By j. hassan & j. ismail  North Vancouver: Presentation House,  1993, $15.00  "What's in a name?" is the title of a  chapter in a book I had on Newfoundland  placesasa child. It's all 1 remember about the  book, but the question arose on its own  when I heard about The Jamelie-Jamila Project.  The photo-text bookwork came out of an  exhibition of work by Jamelie Hassan, entitled Two Women In One, after (but not about)  the novel by Egyptian feminist/doctor/activist/writer Nawal el-Saadawi.  Hassan's exhibition took place at Presentation House, a gallery in North Vancouver, in 1991. Hassan often borrows titles  from books for her works.  Hassan is a visual artist of Lebanese  descent, based in London, Ontario. Jamila  Ismail is a Hong Kong born, Vancouver-  based writer and performer, whose mixed  (South Asian and Chinese) race background goes back several generations. The  Jamelie-Jamila Project, however, is not a systematic explanation of how two women from  such different histories and experiences  ended up with versions of the same name.  Rather, it is a playful journey around the  names, dealing with the histories and the  coincidences that connect them. Yet, it is  only playful in the sense that there is humour, and it is consciously non-linear—the  subject matter is pointed.  The reader/viewer's experience of the  work is one of unfolding—paper, histories,  personal experiences—of the quirky but  powerful truths of the two women who  created it. The reader begins with a folder.  On the outside, the title appears in English, and in large lettering the words  "Jameliejamila" and "project" or "study" in  two different Arabic scripts. Open the middle fold and on one side there is a photograph of power lines and buildings taken in  Rafah Camp, in the Gaza Strip, by Hassan.  On the other side is a poem entitled "Casa  Blanca" by Ismail.  "Casa Blanca" is a wry commentary on  the contradictions of the (media) war on  Iraq: "'...the/wheel, the arch, writing, bureaucracy, government, armies, the state,  the first law code, everything!' /she/wailed,  'came out of iraq!'" Considering that these  are the things the US government claims it  wages war to preserve—in the name not  only of democracy, but of morality—Ismail's  words blow them out of the water, figuratively, if not literally. Later in the poem,  when she drops the phrase "liberation of  kuwait" or "killed, by friendly fire," the  irony and hypocrisy is evident.  When you open the two other flaps, it  reveals the inside of the folder: in a pano  ramic shot, the inhabitants of Rafah Camp  come alive—women, children and soldiers.  The middle section of the photograph is  obscured by two pockets containing the other  textual materials which complete the project:  a book, two greeting cards (of sorts), a bookmark, and five loose cards, each with its own  bit of information that fits into the larger  puzzle.  During a performance to launch The  Jamelie- Jamila Project at Proprioception Books  in Vancouver last month, Ismail says, flapping makeshift wings in a dichotomous truism gone awry: "What's sauce for the goose,  is source for the gender." This is a line from  the piece "umm'age (ar.) homage (fr.),"  which deals in an elliptical way with the  feminization of the word "homage" (from  the French homme, meaning "man"). Changing it to "umm'age," from the Arabic umm,  meaning "mother of," and the object of the  tribute becomes a woman.  The piece deals with the uncomfortable  longings of a mother—having a girl-child  and not-quite wishing the child were a boy.  It is a discomfort for the child also, finding  that, as a woman, she does not have the  freedom to look at men the way men do to  look at women. "I developed dis tinct" she  writes, separate, having the flavour ("tinct",  as in "tincture") of maleness, taking command of the male gaze, but remaining a  woman. The "sauce" is both a flavouring  and the impudence of dyke-ness.  "Umm Tariq" is how Hassan signs my  copy of the book. "Mother of Tariq"...Much  of her work is about children. On the front of  a card—with the message, "Season's Greetings" in both English and Arabic inside—is  an image of two young boys and an older  boy. The older boy holds a rifle; one of the  younger boys carries a slingshot, while the  other is in the process of assembling one. It  is a reproduction of a painting by a 15 year-  old refugee girl from Rafah Camp. The girl  writes: "Let us play, so we can live like other  children of the world." A playful sentiment  indeed, but painfully barbed. It is true, perhaps, that all the children of the world play  war games, as do the adults of the world,  albeit with much more destructive consequences. But when a real war is being waged  in the same streets that children play in, can  their play with guns have the same meaning  as that of the more sheltered children of the  West?  Much of Ismail's humour hinges on  taking what appear to be dichotomies and  pushing them to their often ridiculously logical conclusions, revealing a world which is  infinitely morecomplexthanany dichotomy.  In "Poeisis," 'Jam' is looking after the children of her friends. "Jam," asks the young  boy, Sami, "are you a girl, a mummy, or a  Japanese?" After careful consideration, he  decides she is a girl. She says "and are you a  boy, 1 guess, hmm?/He cackled 'Nope, I'm  a Japanese!'" Next he asks "Do you have a  johnny?" Of course, she does not, she has a  "Jammy," or rather, a "Jammy-whammy!"  And hence, it follows he has a "Sami-yami."  Thereareother sexes too "Mummy-wummy"  and "Daddy-waddy!" And so on. It is this  kind of logic that underlies her work, taking  the reader through a labyrinth, not just of  meaning, but of experience. Characteristics  and occurrences are specific to themselves,  yet fall into a certain order which seems at  times too true to be anything but coincidental. Or perhaps it is the other way around.  The exploration of "coincidence" is not  in relation to each individual piece of text. It  envelops theentire project. Jamila and Jamelie  begin with their names, but find many other  (not so) curious points of correspondence.  For example, is it a coincidence that Hassan  madea piececalled "The Hong Kong," about  the racist destruction of a Chinese-Canadian  eatery, six yearsbeforemeetingjamila Ismail,  who was born in Hong Kong and travels  there regularly? What exactly does the restaurant have to do with the colony?  Begin the list with global colonialism,  racism, the amazing cheer with which people seem to survive these things, and  continue...What is the difference between  the vandals, who, upon finding no cash in  the till, destroyed the restaurant, and the  British, who, finding that their empire is  dying, toss the colony back to a very uncertain relationship with Beijing?  Colonization, the taking over of someone else's space (to begin with), also necessitates pushing people out. The image on the  cover of the booklet is Hassan's re-rendering  of a work by Salwa el Sawahly, who is,  according to one of the five loose cards, a  "disarmingly happy teenager," whose "optimism [is] a challenge to the reality she  paints." El Sawahly will not allow her paintings to leave Gaza, regardless of the  renumeration offered. The fact that they "belong" to the community is too important.  During Jamelie's visit with the El Sawahly,  two sons of the family were taken by the  Gevati military in a raid one night.  In the spirit of the text, one might ask:  how does the name become the women? An  appropriate question since "Jamila" means  "beautiful." The only way Ismail says she  can see to make it fit her, is if she understands the name probably comes from the  Arabic "camel"—cross and strong smelling,  "they eat dry twigs, salt bush Ik thorns  cognating." Their down-to-earthness, their  gritty humanity, and their connection to the  essentials of life—food, clothing, and transportation—offers a standard of beauty quite  different from what is normally expected of  a woman.  Ismail remarks that it is ironic that she  should be the one with the classical Arabic  version of the name, while Jamelie Hassan,  who has much closer ties to the Middle East,  and a long family history there, does not.  Hers is the Lebanese version. Then again,  perhaps this only makes sense. Any notion  of purity at this point would probably not go  very far.  In a piece entitled "Beading a Name,"  Hassan discusses how she came by her name.  She was named after great grandmothers on  both sides of her family. As a child, however, she was called Jumoulie, Jeanie,  Janey...anything but Jamelie. Jeanie and  Janey were the inventions of a white nurse  and a white teacher, respectively. Thenagain,  perhaps the suitability of the name wasn't  much of an issue anyway, since she claims:  "My mother says I never responded to anyone, anyway, regardless of what I was called,  except my dad calling Jumoulie."  The page following "Beading a Name,"  the second to last page of the book, is entitled  "nom sequitur" (Names that do (or do not?)  follow what has gone before them.) It is set  up much as a biography page is usually set  up on the last page of a artists' catalogue or  an anthology.  There are several entries: one is Jamilah  Buhrayd, a member of the Algerian Fronte  de Liberation Nationale, who was condemned to death by the French in 1957. Her  name became a code word in the Middle  East to signify "admiration, respect & desire  for freedom."  Then there is Djamila Boupacha, another FLN agent imprisoned and tortured  by the French. There are, of course, Jamelie  Hassan and Jamila Ismail.  Perhaps the most curious, however, is a  second Jamila Ismail, whose name, at birth,  was "Carol Phillips." In a clipping from the  local Vancouver tabloid, The Province, the  poetjamila Ismail learns that the other Jam ila  Ismail's children, Aziza and Karim, were  abducted by their father. The individual consequences of European and American colonialism, and the consequent diaspora, are as  widespread as they are bizarre.  Handwritten on a flap that makes up  one of the folder's pockets are the words:  "The woman one cannot, geopolitically, imagine/enough to love/be loved, singly in  gift." This is a contribution to the project by  Gayatri Spivak, in her own handwriting.  (Spivak is a South Asian academic living in  the US.)  For Jamelie Hassan and Jamila Ismail,  spanning as many cultures as their name  does, there can be no essential "jamila," and  therefore no essential practice for either, or  any, of them to engage in.  Unravelling the name is a perpetual  journey of discovery, writing or creating  around meanings, because there is no nail  with a head to hit—in spite of the fact that  there are global systems, or that there is  racism, sexism, homophobia manifested in  as many ways as all the jamilas in the world  can experience.

JUNE 1993 Arts  Jewish feminists:  Re-weaving  spiritual life  by Naomi Ehren-Lis  HALF THE KINGDOM:  SEVEN JEWISH FEMINISTS  Edited by Francine Zuckerman  Montreal: Vehicule Press, 1992  "What is your request?  Even if it be half the kingdom  You may have it."  from The Scroll of Esther.  The Studio D, National Film Board  movie, Half the Kingdom, directed by Francine  Zuckerman and Roushell Goldstein, is a  powerful exploration of the experiences of  Jewish women, challenging the reality of  this quotation. The book, Half the Kingdom,  is based on transcripts of interviews from  the film, giving voice to this group of Jewish  women: their voices were previously forbidden by Orthodox Jewish men to be raised in  prayer, study or song.  In Kingdom, seven Jewish feminists from  Canada, the US and Israel, reflect a diversity  of opinions and options in their struggles to  reclaim their "half of the kingdom:" their  share of Jewish communal, secular and religious life.  The women are: Michele Landsberg  from Toronto; Naomi Goldenberg from Ottawa; Naomi Baumel Joseph from Montreal;  Esther Broner from New York; Elyse  Goldstein from Toronto; Shulamit Aloni  from Tel Aviv; and Alice Shalvi from Jerusalem.  Writers, journalists, politicians, educators, academics, a lawyer, a rabbi...these  seven women, in monologue and discussion, together confront a tradition which  remains integral to their deepest identity as  Jews, but which often feels as if it were in  active opposition to their existence as  women...and as feminists:  "I find meaning and promise, challenge  and conflict in my existence as a female Jew.  Frequently, I feel divided as though parts of  myself are in opposition—antithetical, contradictory, antagonistic, clashing, hostile,"  says Baumel Joseph in her speech at the  International Jewish Feminist Conference in  Seeking for an essence which transcends  the discrimination and marginalization imposed by centuries of script and scripture,  and cemented by rigid (legal, biological and  theological) determinism, these women share  their personal experiences, and identify their  priorities.  These priorities may be the development of alternative rituals for women within  Judaism; the deconstruction of the Torah  and the Talmud to reveal their political roots;  the affirmation of Judaism's "pagan base."  These priorities may be the development of  new and very different Biblical interpretations (midrashim) from the perspectives of  the experiences and positive power of  women. Forexample,reinterpreta tions of the  stories of Eve and of Sarah (the wife of the  patriarch Abraham) by Baumel Joseph, an  Orthodox Jew and a Concordia University  professor, are discussed. These were also  presented during a women's workshop in  Vancouver in 1992.  For Shalvi, priorities include founding  of new educational programs for girls and  women. She also sees a need for a focus for  both the physical and moral survival of a  state of Israel which is cognizant of the rights  of all the people of the region: women and  men, Jews and Palestinians.  As with so many Jewish feminists, I find  my own story strongly reflected in the narratives of these women.  For at least a decade, I wandered in the  wilderness of my own confusion and disillusion with what seemed like an insoluble conflict—the emotional bond of my  Jewishness and the alienating reality of day-  to-day experience in synagogue and community. In Kingdom, Broner speaks graphically of her year behind the Mechitzah—the  physical barrier erected in the synagogue to  "keep her in her place" despite her felt need  to respect and remember her deceased father through daily recitation of the Kaddish  prayer.  As with so many Jewish feminists, I  sense somewhere, buried deep under layers  of patriarchal definition and control, an essential Judaism that, perhaps ironically, must  ultimately, be practiced through justice and  equity; in Tikkun Olam, the healing and re-  ^Booltjl  M  an:  new and  gently used books  Philosophy - Poetry  Native - General  Open daily 11am -7pm  Coffee Bar  1020 Commercial Drive  Vancouver BC V5L 3W9  (604) 253-1099  Bonnie Murray  Cynthia Brooke  1988 W 4th & Maple  Vancouver, B.C.

And, as with so many Jewish feminists,  I share the experience of the struggle for  integration of Jewish and feminist self: "It  was a tremendously moving moment when  Phyllis Angel Greenberg sang Kol Nidrei in  a lovely, tender, and passionate voice—a  voice filled with womanly understanding,"  Landsberg says in a section of Kingdom titled  "A positive synagogue experience."  In the section, "Becoming a feminist,"  Landsberg asks: "did feminism enrich  Judaism? There is no question about that. I  found my way back to a form of Judaism  that satisfied me...and gave me a context. I  found an egalitarian congregation that includes women instead of rejecting them and  now I feel more Jewish and more committed  than ever...  "One of the great tragedies is that traditional Judaism was so smug, so negligent,  and so callous towards its women...and lost  them...a terrible loss for Judaism.  "[Now, there are women who] are creatively struggling to make a space in Judaism  for women...One day we will re-nurture  Judaism so it becomes more whole,"  Landsberg concludes.  Broner speaks of new rituals for women.  She is also author of a book, A Weave of  Women, published in 1978.  In the fall of 1992, 300 Jewish feminist  women from across North America, including over 30 women from British Columbia,  participated in a conference in Seattle, Washington. As a closing ritual, we wove a canopy  from multi-coloured ribbons reminiscent of  the "Succah," the weave of branches which  symbolizes a Jewish fall festival. Along with  my sisters, I retained a small strip of ribbon  tied to a strap on my purse.  This is clearly a book for Jewish women,  dealing unapologetically with issues of importance for Jewish women.  It is also a book articulating feminist  struggle, the struggle for women's rights  and definition within Judaism, and for Jewish women to retain and assert their individual Jewish identities within the wider  women's movement.  Perhaps, however, inher song "Ordination Blues," Rabbi Elyse Goldstein touches  on the more universal realities that underlie  the particular:  "What sect you're in doesn't matter much.  They say, 'Give us time. We still need to see.'  But we know that change ain't in a rush  As long as He who does the teaching and  He who does the preaching...  and He who knows the Bible and  He who runs the school, and He who writes  the rules, and He who calls the hour, and  He who has the power is not a She."  Since she wrote her song, Elyse Goldstein  has seen the opportunity for ordination extended to many women, whether they are  Jewish or from other traditions.  Through song and argument, politics  and prayer, Francine Zuckerman invites us  to accompany these seven women in what  can no longer be a polite "request" for "half  thekingdom/'butanarticulateinsistenceon  our share.  I was excited by the film—it was one of  the first statements I had experienced of  Jewish feminism. And I am gratified by the  written text. It gives the opportunity to spend  more time with these women, consider their  processes, and to dialogue, m yself, with their  issues and choices.

We went to see the plays  together, and talked about them afterward. We  then co-wrote this article over the electronic mail  system on the computers at work-each of us  commenting on what was being written by the  others, adding a few thoughts as we went along.  The following is what came out of the process.  But first, some context...  We filed into the dim theatre, not knowing what to expect. We walked under the  illuminated pattern of a Celtic cross, its bent  armsand endless complicated knotting foreshadowing the complexity of the play to  come.  Seating ourselves, we looked at the vast  stage. On it, a large figure sits on a throne on  the left, a marvellously decorated cave is in  the centre, and there are what looks like long  sacks on the right. The lights go out, and the  man sitting on the throne screams, as he  pulls at the sword in his leg. The sacks start  heaving, as the people in them emerge, chanting in Celtic and circling the king on his  throne. There is a hint of magic, of mystery,  and of agony.  Juliet: I found the figure of Arthur, dying in his chair, full of memory and regret, to  be a powerful one—the presence of his anguish filled the room. The sword that  wounded him is pulled from his thigh at the  end of the first part by Morgana; with this  act, she frees Arthur from his death and from  the fate which binds him. We step into a  story that is fundamentally changed from  any version of the legends we have known  before.  Gladys: The first part of Paradise and the  Wasteland was a magical experience for me.  The beautifully constructed set was only  surpassed by the quality of the acting and  the lushness of the dialogue. At times, I'd  realize I hadn't understood what the characters had said in the last few minutes because  I had been caught up in the beauty of the  language.  Juliet: Yes, the language sounded more  like poetry than dialogue—it was delivered  rather than spoken. I kept thinking of the  Celtic oral tradition, where poetry was the  living centre of their culture.  Gladys: In this retelling of the legend,  Morgana is taught by the spirits of the land  and raised to be a woman of power. She is,  after all, daughter of Igraine, a powerful  earth-goddess figure in Celtic mythology.  Mourning the loss of her innocence, Morgana  reaches adulthood and falls in love with  Arthur. She is forced to choose between  Arthur and her spirit guide, Eirie; her commitment to Eirie is made only after she conceives a child, Modred, with Arthur.  Janet: Morgana and Eirie were by far the  most interesting and well-developed characters in the play. The women who played  them, Imelda Villa Ion and Christine Menzies,  were tied together by a cord. They would  come together intimately...then Morgana  would struggle to get away from Eirie.  Morgana's internal conflicts, as a woman  who encompasses the sacred and the ordinary within herself, were reflected in their  Donna Yamamoto as Guenevere  movements towards and away from each  other.  Morgana 'shard-made choices, between  love, children, and relationships, clearly illuminate the theme of choice and responsibility. Not only is it a skilful way of presenting different aspects of the myths and legends surrounding Morgana, but it was also  exquisitely staged and performed.  Gladys: Morgana, a female, earth-based  voice, is the sorrowful, opposing force to  Merlin, who is an elemental of corruption in  this play—not the wise, aged patriarch we've  been taught to see him as, but a twisted,  power-hungry force, interested only in his  place in history.  Juliet: Merlin was a kinetic, evil energy  writhing around the stage. He was very  sinister. I remember the playwright's comment that Merlin was the embodiment of  ambition.  Gladys: I found that, much as I detested  him, he was always a focal point on the  stage, even when he was just malevolently  eavesdropping on another character. He was  the force of patriarchy, with its power and its  tendency to decide what is best for all people.  Janet: I was most enthralled with the  play when the themes were revealed through  the poetry of the text, through illusion, magic  and myth, through the characters and their  relationships, their individual and collective  journeys. The writing and staging shows the  complex relationships that people have with  destiny, choice and self-determination. The  characters are responsible for their actions.  As Merlin cackles, "Beware the wizard's  bargain"—beware the bargains made to obtain power.  Gladys: One of the reasons I went to see  the play was the "non-traditional" casting. I  knew that several people of colour had been  cast in major roles, and I was intrigued by  the possibilities.  Juliet: The casting created a sense of  inclusion—of the legends made universal.  This story is about magic and fate and betrayal; bargains made and the ensuing treachery; redemption and mysticism. It certainly  wasn't about a bunch of white guys crashing  around the country looking for the Holy  Grail.  Janet: I agree. I really appreciated the  non-traditional casting. It was just a part of  the production's high standards overall.  Gladys:! was also very impressed by the  set, one of the biggest and most elaborate  that I've seen outside of the mega-musicals  in mainstream culture.  Janet: I really liked the dirt, the dust, the  feeling of being outside. It was great to see  the set being used so imaginatively, thanks  to the directors' choices and the capabilities  of the actors.  Juliet: The scenes that stayed in my mind  included Merlin scuttling into the opening  rock beneath Arthur's throne; the vision of  Igraine as Lady of the Lake, bathing in the  pool; Merlin perched at the top of the cave  stretching out two huge fabric wings to encompass this world—they used the potential of the set to its extreme. The music was  particularly beautiful, simple and evocative.  I loved the first part of the play; I was  completely captivated.  Gladys: The second part of the play had  a few problems, however. The first part was  lyrical, moody, and expressive. The second  part seemed to bog down in the plot.  Juliet: Did the second part try to cover  too much? I got the feeling that many of the  conventions of the Arthur legend were being acknowledged without being explored.  There was such excitement in the first  half, it really felt like we were seeing some  thing new—whereas the second half felt  more self-conscious, as if Dancoes really  wanted to address, and provide an alternative image to, every character, every act,  every part of the myth.  Janet: It's a shame the style of the first  half was abandoned in the second. The author could have trusted the strength of the  styleand content enough to carry thatthrough  the whole play. It's like the first half was  experimental and daring, and the second  was attempting to make sure that everyone  got the point, in terms of plot and message.  Gladys: Another problem is the density  of the references. I've read so many interpretations of the Arthur legends that I got all the  references they were making.  Janet: I'm sure the references, though  gratifying for Arthur fans, would have confused anyone who didn't know so much  about the mythology. It isn't very accessible  for women who don't have access to all that  education.  Juliet: Putting the pieces together was a  lovely puzzle, but a play should not leave us  with the feeling that we're so well-read, we  know all the writer's sources. It should leave  us with a feeling of rediscovery and creation,  a mix of old and new. Spending more time  contemplating the cultural resonance than  enjoying the play is for recovering English  majors. I think Dancoes tries to write her  way out of the tragedy but didn't quite bring  it off.  The play would have made an extraordinary piece done as one long performance, ,  using many of the elements from the second  part and integrating them into the structure  of the first. She could have allowed Arthur to  die. She didn't have to redeem all the characters. The Primal Mother Goddess bit, which  wasn't quite brought off, was flaky, and  made the emotional pitch slightly askew.  Janet: The return of the characters to the  earth mother seemed a simplistic solution,  considering the complexities of character  and plot earlier in the play.  Gladys: One of the problems I have with  eco-feminism is the association of women  with the earth, and 'mother' nature. It seems  to recreate that image of woman as fertile,  and bearer of children. While it does empower women in some sense, it also returns  us to a stereotyped role of mother and  caregiver.  Juliet: But Dancoes does redeem herself  with a brilliant ending. After all the characters go to the cave of Mother Earth, Modred  is left alone, cursing in the dark and looking  for someone to fight with.  Janet: Yes, leaving Modred with no one  to fight was a wonderful statement on how  there can be no war, revenge, or power mon-  gering if we don't agree to play the deadly  game. If we refuse to accept our fates, we can  change them.  As the directors wrote in the program  book, "Perhaps it is possible to reject the  concept of pre-desrined fate and, ta king fate  into our own hands, negotiate a healthier  future."  Gladys: It was like we were watching the  weaving of a tapestry. Taken individually,  the bits of dialogue and music were like  individual threads, though beautifully  stitched. Seen as a whole, the seemingly  meaningless elements came together, slightly  flawed, but beautiful nonetheless, showing  the hard work that went into it.   Janet Brook wants to explore the ley lines and  faery knolls on a certain little island off the  Atlantic coast. Juliet O'Keefe is fascinated by the  potential of computer networks to empower  ivomen. Gladys We Iras been obsessed by the  Camelot legends since she's been able to read.  JUNE 1993  19 Letters  dear     reader  Kinesis loves receiving mail. Please  get your letter to us by the 18th of the  month.  If you can, keep the length to about  500 words. (If you go way over, we  might edit for space.)  Hope to hear from you very soon.  Love,  Kinesis  Circling Dawn 1:  Boycott continues  Kinesis:  It has now been several months since a  group of women began the boycott of Circling Dawn Organic Foods as reported in the  April issue of Kinesis.  We are writing to let everyone know  that this boycott is not over. We have taken  time to rest and regroup and are now renewing our efforts to hold the collective at Circling Dawn accountable for their behaviour.  CirclingDawnhas yet to address, inany  truthful or substantive way, the crimes  against women committed by members of  its staff. Rather, some of them have tried to  threaten and intimidate women they believe  to be involved with the boycott group. Their  attempts to silence us have only made us  more committed to continuing this necessary work.  Over the last few months, two women  have received death threats. One of these  threats was received on the boycott's information line (255-6386) and was recorded. It  said, in part, "how many times does it take to  get the death sentence? We're not going to  stop until we get the death sentence." The  word "death" was then repeated over and  over again. These threats have been reported  to the police. In one instance, the case is  being investigated by the Vancouver Integrated Intelligence Unit.  Almost all of the women who are part of  the organized boycott, and many of our  friends, have been followed repeatedly by  men from Circling Dawn. We have seen  them exit the store, follow us as we walk,  and return to the store. Our friends have  been cornered by men who have tried to  interrogate them. Three of our members  have had these men try to follow them home.  We have been forced to call the police  several times because of this threatening  behaviour. Some of these calls have resulted  in case numbers being issued, despite the  fact that stalking is not yet a criminal offence  under Canadian law.  These events constitute a concerted and  organized harassment campaign. Any attempt to make a woman afraid for her safety  is a form of violence.  In this context, Circling Dawn's much-  publicized request for mediation is clearly  absurd. We feel that we must reiterate this  point: no woman who has been abused  should ever have to enter into any kind of  dialogue with her abuser unless she so  chooses. By engaging in this kind of abusive  behaviour, the staff members of Circling  Dawn have irrevocably destroyed any possibility of mediation.  We continue to receive a great deal of  additional information from women in the  community over the contact line but have  declined to release it until it can be verified.  We have since investigated some of Circling Dawn's claims and found them to be  false: Circling Dawn is a collective. Not true.  Our research with the City of Vancouver  Permits and Licences Department and the  province of British Columbia shows that  Circling Dawn is wholly owned and control-  ~20  led by Thomas Evans. It is not a registered  cooperative. None of the staff people have  any legal or otherwise enforceable right to  any control of, or profits from, the business.  Evans has since claimed that he is merely a  figurehead and hasno control over the store's  finances. Business owners in the Commercial Drive area tell us all cheques they receive  from Circling Dawn carry Evans' signature.  We did not expect the interest the state  is taking in the treatment of children at Circling Dawn. We hear that children in the  collective may not be receiving the education they are entitled to. We hear that many  do not attend schools, municipal or home-  based. We do not believe that state intervention is a solution because the children could  merely be moved into dangerous and abusive situations. We do not doubt the competence of collective members as parents.  Evans has been pressuring women both  currently and formerly involved with Circling Dawn to sign affidavits that say they  have experienced no abuse.  We note that there has been some discussion among people in the Commercial  Drive community about the possibility of  "community-based solutions" to this problem. We believe violence against women is a  community problem, that it is pervasive and  systemic, and we hope our action encourages members of the community to examine  the issue of misogyny in its larger, political  context.  Our understanding of violence against  women as a community problem means we  have met with a large number of local residents and merchants, from whom we have  received an overwhelmingly positive response. We have also met with community  groups, including the Crandview-Wood-  lands Area Council and the Vancouver  Greens. The Green Party has agreed to place  Circling Dawn on their boycott list.  A number of Circling Dawn ex-volunteers have called the boycott line to offer  thanks and appreciation. We have been encouraged by their support.  Our understanding of community, however, extends beyond the Commercial Drive  area to the larger community of women  everywhere. To this end, we have sought the  advice of both Vancouver Rape Relief and  Transition House and Women Against Violence Against Women Rape Crisis Centre in  Vancouver to develop a broad-based strategy-  Any effort to find a "community-based"  solution to violence against women unfortunately carries with it a very real danger,  which has become apparent to us through  the course of this action. It is essential that we  not lose sight of the fact tha t violence against  women is experienced at an individual level,  and that the women survivors must be our  first concern.  On certain occasions, some members of  the community have placed themselves in  the role of judge. We have heard terms like  "hard proof" and "evidence" before they  will believe these women. Some have told us  that they want to "wait to see how the court  cases progress." Some have actually gone so  far as to pressure us to release our confidential case numbers with the Vancouver Police  Department so that they might conduct their  own "investigation."  In a newly-found role as arbiter of truth,  it is easy to forget a certain basic feminist  principle: women do not lie about being  abused and have every right to choose how  they wish to respond to that abuse.  Very simply: women say they have been  abused by the owner and some staff members of Circling Dawn. Some women have  asked us to publicize these experiences. We  will continue to do what is necessary to  protect both ourselves and other women  from this abuse. We encourage anyone who  wants additional information in this matter  or needs support or wishes to provide support, to call the boycott contact line at 255-  6386.  Sincerely,  Stephanie Smith  Julia Piatt  Members of the Circling Dawn  Boycott Action Group  Vancouver, BC  Circling Dawn 2:  Boycott supported  Kinesis:  I am inclined to write because I think it  has become important for me to clarify my  position as a supporter of the Circling Dawn  boycott effort [see Kinesis, Apr.93.J 1 do not  consider myself to be a member of an "action  group." Rather, I am part of a network of  individuals with serious concerns about the  conduct of certain Circling Dawn members  and allies. The network to which I belong, as  far as I'm concerned, has no leaders or fixed  spokespersons.  I would also like to qualify myself as a  full and sincere supporter of native sovereignty, environmentalism, organic agriculture and many other movements. Despite  this, I am unable, and have been unable for  some time, to support Circling Dawn, and I  will probably not shop there for a long time.  I have witnessed and been subject to  numerous acts of overt and covert abuse  perpetuated by members and allies of the  "collective," for three years. On several occasions, both prior and subsequent to the  initiation of the boycott, attempts have been  made to verbally coerce and physically intimidate me into attending a "circle" at Circling Dawn.  I believe these were attempts to silence  me from expressing outrage over flagrant  sexist and racist behaviour I have witnessed  certain Circling Dawn members and allies  engaging in. Usually, I would share my  observations with young poor wimmin like  5X  Canadian Magazines  I for  event one ^K9M9M^  How, M3 pii 1)1 ications to choose from!  2 Slewarl Street  Toronlo, Canada  M5V1H6  myself. It is important for me to spread  accurate information so that people can make  informed decisions about what degree of  involvement they want to have with Circling  Dawn.  I have personally found the Circling  Dawn work-exchange-for-food deal to have  been somewhat seductive, especially when I  have been broke, hungry and unhealthy.  However, I have had sufficient opportunity  to believe several individuals who frequent  and operate Circling Dawn are misogynist,  racist, ageist and otherwise exploitative.  Attempts to hold Circling Dawn members and allies accountable for this behaviour prefaced the eruption of posters on the  Drive, which openly criticized Circling  Dawn. Prior to this, the only unsolicited  conflict resolution opportunity offered me  was to attend a "circle."  I have no desire to attend a "circle" at  Circling Dawn, as I consider their circles to  be unsafe for expression of a "minority"  perspective or opinion. I attended a "circle"  a year ago and did not consider it to be a  collective, or consensus building scenario.  Rather, it appears to be one in which opinions and prerogatives of white, straight ma les  prevailed.  While many at Circling Dawn work  hard on behalf of causes they believe in, acts  of oppression towards wimmin, people of  colour, lesbians, gays and others by certain  individuals at Circling Dawn sabotage the  long term viability of their efforts. I do not  blame the individuals. However, the ignorance of many of Circling Dawn's members  and allies has been repeatedly contested,  and there can be no more excuses made for  their nasty group dynamics.  My grievance is and has always been  with this persistent denial and unaccountable position Circling Dawn members and  allies assume. If they continue to deny any  and all allegations, it seems unlikely that  there will be any significant changes at Circling Dawn in the near future.  I am prepared to substantiate and defend in court everything I have written here,  if necessary. I also have grounds for launching a slander suit against members of Circling Dawn who have attempted to publicly  ridicule meand others with sexist and homophobic fabrications. Members of Circling  Dawn have contacted my place of work and  those of other wimmin and demanded that  we be fired, following our participation in a  demonstration outside Circling Dawn on  Saturday, March 14.  I will continue to defend myself and  others against any more malevolent acts by  members of Circling Dawn on members of  the network and others, as I will continue to  expose and contest this kind of behaviour by  individuals anywhere.  I would like to congratulate and thank  all the people who support and believe me. Bulletin Board  read     this]  Bulletin Board listings have a  maximum of 50 words.
