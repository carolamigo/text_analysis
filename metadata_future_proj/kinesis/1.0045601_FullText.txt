Well, just ask women in Ontario  for the answer, now that they have a new  right-wing premier named Mike Harris.  How Wrong is Mike Harris for women  and anyone else who's not intimately  linked with the Bay Street bankers? For  some thoughts on this question, turn to  Judy Rebick's analysis on page 7.  Of course, women and progressive  people in Ontario were not going to run  and hide even after such a depressing  election result. On the day Harris and  his regressive...uh, we mean, Progressive Conservative party was sworn as  the government of Ontario, thousands  of people staged a demonstration outside the provincial legislature in Ontario  to let Harris know that his attacks on  women, single moms, people of colour,  First Nations people, poor people, working-class people, people with  disabUities...willdefinitely,definitelynot  go unchallenged.  Here in BC, as Kinesis goes to  press., .once again, the NDP government  has foiled us. Usually, when the NDP  does something like release its budget or  pass a law affecting women, it picks  Press Day to do it! So here we go  again—there's now an update to our  story on the proposed legislation to restrict anti-choice protests around abortion clinics and the homes of abortion  service providers [see page 5]—It's been  passed into law.  And as we expected, the BC Liberal  caucus couldn't let the legislation pass  without causing a stir. Just as the vote on  the bill was about to be held, two Liberal  party members dashed out of the House  missing...avoiding...the voting.  Here's some more on the legislative  side of things...Now it's been confirmed—men who sexually assault  women and try to get away with it by  claiming they were "too drunk" will no  longer have that excuse. The federal  government justpassed alaw toprevent  the use of the extreme drunkenness  defense in sexual assault trials.  The new law wipes out the recent  SupremeCourtof Canada decision which  overturned Henri Daviault's rape conviction [see Kinesis, December/January  1995]. But of course, every silver lining  has its dark cloud...here's some news  you likely didn't hear in the dailies.  Even though the Supreme Court ordered Daviault to be tried again for rape,  he didn't have to spend much time in a  courtroom. Thetrial judge and theCrown  dropped the charges against Daviault  because the woman he raped had died  two years ago—No witness, no crime.  Isn't it encouraging to know that justice  is being served?Please...enough already!  Back to the Supreme Court...given  its ruling in extreme drunkenness case,  it shouldn't have suprised us when the  Court ruled against Suzanne  Thibaudeau's challenge to being taxed  on child support she receives [see story  page 3]. Clearly, it looks like the Supreme  Court is swinging farther and farther (or  is that further and f urther?) to the Right.  Hey, could it have anything to do with  the fact the Supreme Court's located in  Ontario? Is Mike Harris on the Supreme  Court? Okay, let's stop these scary, scary  thoughts.   jl^Vi'. '  Oh hey, here's a funny little gem for  you.. .The Pope is now saying that the  Roman, Catholic Church is "a leading  force against sexual discrimination and  oppression [of women]." Of course, the  Pope still maintains theChurchisagainst  contraceptives and abortion and women  priests, and...  Well, this just adds to our evidence  of how far the anti-progressive forces  will go in co-opting our language and  using it against us. Want more examples?

And while Kinesis is in Beijing, women  around the world will be celebrating on  September 6th an International Day of  Action.  We've heard that all the Take Back  the Night rallies against violence against  women in Canada will be held on the  same day in solidarity with women's  struggles worldwide. In our September  issue, we'll be letting you know about  many of the actions and events being  planned for September 6th.  So here's a surprise. A report just  released has blasted the University of  British Columbia for not dealing with  the "widespread racism and sexism in  its political science department." Poli  Sri departments, university sexist and  racist? Isn't it shocking!  We'll be bringing you all the details  and analysis about the UBC Poli Sri  story next issue, along with lots of other  stories on women and education.  Until then, we're taking a month off  to rest...on the beach of course...so we  hope you too have lots of fun in the  sunshine. See you in September.  It's summertime in the city and at  Kinesis as we prepare this summer double-issue. Resisting the lure of sunshine  and Vancouver's nude beaches, hardy  Kinesis volunteers showed up to  ungrudgingly put in time on the paper—nsuring we make it to press on  time. But don't worry, folks, we all get to  enjoy some much-needed time off for  those trips to the beach in July when  Kinesis closes down for the month.  June was a busy month as far as  volunteer time goes. We completed production of the Kinesis marketing materials, and the 1995 Kinesis subscription  drive is up and away. Women on the  receiving end of our sub drive are Canadian Ms Magazine readers, women who  used to receive our Halifax-based sister  newspaper Pandora (which shut down  last year due to burnout and finances,)  patrons of Sister Vision Press, and other  currently non-subscribing friends-of-  Kinesis nationally.  Many thanks are due to women in  the Sub drive Stuffing (envelopes) Parties: Susan MacFarlane, Alex Hennig,  Rebecca Knowles, Grace Wandolo,  Miche Hill, Agnes Huang, Laiwan,  Fatima Jaffer, Dominic Wandolo,  Charlen Wandolo, Jon Wandolo, Lissa  Geller, Teresa Drewicki, Robyn Hall,  wendy lee kenward, and Patsy Catsy.  Special special thanks to Grace  Wandolo, who coordinated the marketing project for Kinesis over the last two  months on a Section 25 grant and who  developed the sub drive materials. We  couldn't have finished the sub drive  without her perseverance and good humour at a time when Kinesis was undergoing major staff and other upheavals.  Thanks, Grace!  Special thanks also to Rebecca  Knowles, who volunteered her time and  expertize with Canada Post procedures  to help us sort the mail into the correct  batchesand bundles and...yes, she taught  us the strange, but surprisingly catchy  Canada Post lingo too!  We've got some great news that will  allow Kinesis to bring you original and  on-the-scene reports from the United  Nations 4th World Coneference on  Women and NGO Women's Forum in  Beijing China. Former editor Fatima  Jaffer was chosen by the Canada Beijing  Facilitating Committee to be an official  CanadianNGOdelegate to Beijing. Since  we figure Fatima will be unable to talk to  all 40,000 women at Beijing during the  ten-day-long forum, Kinesis has decided  to send cute and improved Kinesis editor  Agnes Huang too! Butwearealongway  from raising the $4,000 we need to send  Agnes to bring back all the news about  women at Beijing that won't be in the  dailies. We'd like to say a big Thank You  to the Women's Research Centre in Vancouver for being the first to generously  donate towards this end. If you'd like to  help, call Agnes at 255-5499.  And now for the new writers who  contributed in this issue. Thanks to:  Aradhana Seth, Kay Pamala Ray, Fay  Blaney, Kalpana Mehta, Luiza Bairros,  Eileen O'Brien, Kike Roach, and  Francoise David.  That's it for this month. We'll be  back in August to work on our September issue, when we will bring you the  when-where-and-who'11-be-there of the  1995 annual Kinesis benefit and raffle.  Meanwhile, if you'd like to volunteer on  production or write,call Agnesor-Laiwan  at 255-5499. Until then, have a great  summer!  JULY/AUGUST 1995 News  Taxing child support:  "Power wins against justice"  ammmmmmmmmmmmmm  by Sue Vohanka  A recent Supreme Court of Canada  decision—upholding a 1942 rule that  makes women pay income tax on child  support payments—is a major setback  in the struggle for equality.  Women's groups are now calling on  the federal government to change the  Income Tax Act and create a fairer system of child support, following a 5-2  Supreme Court ruling in May against  Suzanne Thibaudeau. The Quebec single mother had challenged the provision  in the tax act—the inclusion/deduction  system—that forces custodial parents  (98 percent of whom are women) to pay  tax on child support, while giving a tax  break to non-custodial parents (mostly  men) who pay child support.  Suzanne Thibaudeau is disappointed  andangrythatherfiveyearbattleagainst  this discriminatory tax law has ended  this way.  "The government knows I'm right,  but power wins against justice. I'm  ashamed to live in a country like this,  where women and children are not important and the government chooses to  maintain women and children in poverty," Thibaudeau told the media. "It's  clear that the law is made by men for  men. Women will pay the price for this  bad judgment."  Sunera Thobani, president of the  National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) says that the Supreme Court has betrayed custodial  mothers and dealt a blow to equality  rights.  "The Thibaudeau decision penalizes single mothers for raising children.  It is a major setback, and ultimately,  children will pay the price. Taxing moth-  erswhoreceivepaymentswhilereward-  ing fathers who make them by giving  them a tax break is clearly unfair," says  Thobani.  NAC was part of a coalition of women's and anti-poverty groups which intervened in the case to argue that the  inclusion/deduction system violated  women's guarantee of sex equality rights  under the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms. The other members of the  coalition were: the Women's Legal Edu-  cationand Action Fund (LEAF), the Federated Anti-Poverty Groups of BC  (FAPG), and the Charter Committee on  Poverty Issues.  Since 1942, the Income Tax Act has  contained an inclusion /deduction  scheme which treats separated parents  as a "family unit" for tax purposes. Under this system, women pay $330 million a year in taxes on child support  payments, while men save $660 million  in taxes.  Brenda Schaff, a North Vancouver  mother who has also taken the govern-  The "Post-Divorce Family" Unit  It's clear that the law is made by men for men.  Women will pay the price for this bad judgment.  — Suzanne Thibaudeau  ment to court, isn't impressed by the  judges' notions about the "post-divorce  family unit." Her ex-husband doesn't  even see his kids. "We're no family unit.  He doesn't even send them a birthday  present," says Schaff.  Sunera Thobani says the Supreme  Court ignored reality in basing its ruling  on the assumption that the "family unit"  assume that taxing child support does  not place a burden on custodial parents.  "[The Supreme Court's decision]  seems to be based on a conception of  familial relationships that is detrimental  to women," says Hardie. "In their analysis, the rights of women become obscured by the notion of the role of a  couple in our society. It doesn't recog-  We're no family unit He doesn't even send  [the kids] a birthday present — Brenda Schaff  as a whole is not harmed after a divorce  or separation. "They seem to ignore that  the issue [of child support] arises precisely because that unit has broken  down," says Thobani. "In the real world,  benefits that accrue to the father do not  "trickle down" to the mother. They stay  with him while women and children  sink further into poverty." §$/.' * \'£ -  Many women never receive child  supportpayments—even court-ordered  ones. About 600,000 women in Canada,  nize the independence of a woman in  that relationship."  Many single mothers anxiously  waited for a decision in favour of Suzanne  Thibaudeau. They had been hopeful  given an earlier ruling by the Federal  Court of Appeal in Thibaudeau's case  that the tax on child support is discriminatory on the basis of family status [see  Kinesis, June 1994].  Following the Court of Appeal's  decision, more than 20,000 women ap-  In the real world, benefits that accrue to the  father do not "trickle down" to the mother.  They stay with him while women and children  Sink further into poverty — Sunera Thobani  63 percent of whom are single mothers,  receive no child support from their ex-  husbands and partners. And across the  country, 75 per cent of men are in default  of child support payments. In Ontario  alone, more than 90,000 fathers are in  arrears.  Katherine Hardie, a lawyer with the  BC Public Interest and Advocacy Centre  and one of the lawyers who represented  the coalition at the Supreme Court, says  the majority of the judges was wrong to  plied for refunds of tax they paid on  child support in 1993. Now, the government has put them on notice that they'll  have to pay back taxes on the child  . support they received.  Brenda Schaff says her lawyers will  examine the Supreme Court decision to  determine whether she can pursue her  court case further, but she says it doesn't  look promising. "It's pretty discouraging. For me it's been really depressing  because I owe quite a lot of money," she  says. Schaff says she may have to consider declaringbankruptcy if she'sforced  to pay back taxes.  FAPG's Gisele Guay says that with  its ruling, the Supreme Court failed to  appreciate the reality experienced by  single parents, especially those who are  poor. "Child support payments are already too low. Single parents living in  poverty cannot get their child support  payments increased to provide adequate  food and clothing, let alone to cover the  cost of the tax on child support," says  Guay.  The Court ruled that the issue of  adequate child support settlements—  enough to cover taxes—should be dealt  with in the family law courts, and not by  changing the tax law.  Sunera Thobani says the suggestion  that women who are not satisfied with  child support settlements seek redress  before the family law courts is ludicrous. "Very little legal aid is available  for family law cases, and many women  are fearful of returning before the courts  to face hostile ex-husbands," Thobani  says.  Judy Poulin, president of SCOPE  (Support and Custody Orders for Priority Enforcement), an Ontario-based custodial parents rights group which also  intervened in the Thibaudeau case, adds  that the comments of the male judges  showed they have no understanding at  all for the plight of single mothers. The  five judges who ruled against  Thibaudeau were men; the two judges  deciding in her favour were women.  Poulin says women now need to  press politicians to change the child support system, but she adds that it will be  an uphill battle. Last year, the federal  government sent a task force on child  support to hold consultations across the  country, but still no changes have been  made.  Poulin says that even though the  governmentheardquiteclearlythatchild  support shouldn't be taxed, they've left  the inclusion/deduction system intact.  "The government should be looking at  what's best for the kids in this situation,  and that's not what they're doing," says  Poulin. "They're trying to come up with  the way they can save the most money."

JULY/AUGUST 1995 News  Women in Quebec march against poverty:  For bread and roses  by Denise Nadeau  Sunday May 28, Saint-Hyacinthe  The. South Shore march  12 noon: Over 200 tired and thirsty  women crowd into the basement hall of  the cathedral. Lunch is being hosted by  the Saint Hyacinthe Bread and Roses  Committee. About 20 women are in the  toilet line-up on the far side of the old  church hall. Another 30 or so are sitting  on the shaded lawn outside, most with  shoes and socks off as they rest their  blistered and aching feet. They have  walked 10 kilometers this morning after  a hard nightsleepingin two school gyms.  Two days before, thousands of  women had gathered at three locations  in Riviere-du-Loup, Longueil (South  Shore march)and Montreal (NorfhShore  march) and started off on a ten day, 250  kilometre trek towards Quebec City,  marching to draw attention to issues of  poverty for woinentoQuebec.Themarch  had been organized over two years, and  would bring together 15,000 women  from all regions of Quebec and from all  walks of life.  1:30 pm: The march is about to leave  the cathedral. Everyone is in formation  in the square at the front of the church,  waiting for the last few women in the  washrooms. Some are doing stretches  on the lawn; others are filling up their  water bottles, adjusting baseball caps  against the hot sun, chatting and laughing, with new friends. The age range of  the group 4S; wide—from late teens to  early 70s, Several men from the local  CSN (Confederation of National Trade  Unions) are accompanying us on bicycles.  Suddenly the march is moving, a  surge and then a loud chant, "sonnez les  cloches" (ring the bells). A local police  car leads off, followed by the banner  carriers. In the rear is the music van with  two loudspeakers which alternate between playing the song, Du Pain et des  Roses (Bread and Roses), and broadcasting the voice of a woman leading us in  chants and songs adapted from popular  Quebecois tunes. The Quebec Federation of Nurses van follows, providing  medical supplies, bandages and beds  for anyone who feels sick or too tired to  goon.  Horns honk.People wave. Wemove  onto a sidestreet. Women come out of  theirhousesor yards to wave and watch.  Some Du Pain et des Roses posters are  posted in windows. A few houses have  placards on their lawn saying "No to  poverty/' of "Poverty of women, is a  scandal". Some of the marchers hand  out pamphlets explaining the nine demands of the Women's March Against  Poverty [see box]. Some women with  their children and a few men join the  march: *£_•£■"■  3:30 pm: The march arrives in Saint  Rosalieandisgreeted by the Saint Rosalie  Committee. Here the marchers will  board their buses and drive to Granby  where they will finish the last five kilometres of their day.  May 30, Trois-Rivieres  The North Shore march  6:00 pm: The women have just arrived at the Cathedral hall. Dinner tonight is chicken and fries from a local  low-incomeco-opbusiness. The women  are assigned to their billets—one bus to  theUrsulines;onetotheOblates(aCatho-  lic religious order); the third to a  highschool in a suburb.  8:00 pm: At the Trois-Rivieres Cultural Centre, four women are being honoured with gifts of bread and roses as  the "godmothers" of the march for the  Maurice/Bois Francs region. One isa 70-  year-old great grandmother who has  fought for pensioners rights in her region; another, in her sixties, has been an  anti-poverty organizer and militante for  years; the third is the coordinator of the  Louiseville Women's Centre and has  helped organize the women's movement  in the region; and the fourth is Suzanne  Thibaudeau, who had just lost her Supreme Court challenge against paying  taxes on child support payments.  Five international guests—from  Peru, Nicaragua, Mali and Mozambique—give brief solidarity greetings  and explain how the impoverishment of  womenisaninternational phenomenon.  The evening closes with a funny play  about women's roles put on by the Trois-  Rivieres Women's literacy group.  May 31, Trois-Rivieres  9:00 am: The marchers are gathering  at a park by the St. Laurence, the sun  glistening on the water. Several local  dignitaries—a member of the National  Assembly, the social affairs representative of the Quebec Catholic Bishops, and  a municipal councillor—give greetings  from the podium. The MNA announces  there is progress in the negotiations in  Quebec City with the march's spokeswomen... three of the demands are already met. Loud cheers. A woman with  a cellular phone reports on the other two  marches—the South Shore group is two  hours behind and marching in pouring  rain; the Riviere-du-Loup group is do-  ing fine and sends their love. Morecheers.  These were a few brief moments I  experienced in two of the > women's  marches to Quebec City. All three  branches of the 10-day Quebec Women's March Against Poverty converged  on the National Assembly in Quebec  City on June 4, and were met by 15,000  supporters.  Premier Jacques Parizeau and Employment Minister Louise Harel met the  marcherstoannouncethatseven of their  nine demands had been partially met.  Yet the marchers could not be bought  off. They greeted Parizeau with loud  boos when he announced the minimum  wage would be raised only 45 cents.  The march was successful in reaching some of its demands and in making  women's poverty visible in the Quebec  media. It was one of the most well-  organized campaigns in recent Quebec  history.  The idea of the march was initiated  by the Federation des Femmes du  Quebec more than a year ago. It was  timed for June, close to the referendum  date [on the Quebec sovereignty issue],  when the government would be wanting women's votes.  More than 40 groups, ranging from  unions, anti-poverty groups, immigrant  groups, and women's organizations,  joined in on the planning. In each of the  12 regions of Quebec, a regional organ-  izing committee was struck.  In February and March, a popular  education "animation kit" was sent out  to all member groups. It explained the  nine demands, raising for discussion,  these questions: Whythisdemand? What  are the issues? and Why just women?  In Quebec, where 21 percent of  women live below the poverty line; 49  percent of single women are poor; 82  percent of single parent families are  headed by women, and 58 percent of  these live in poverty; and 61 percent of  minimum wage earners are women, the  march's demands struck a sympathetic  cord. Over 1000 volunteers in 30 towns  supported the 600 women marchers,  and hundreds more showed up at each  of the public events along the way.  The decision to use the theme Du  Pain et des Roses recalls the demands of  the American women textile workers at  the turn of the century. The decision to  march on Quebec City recalls the historic march of Quebec women for the  vote in 1940. In making these symbolic  choices, Quebec women reaffirmed that  the women's movement is a force in  history to be reckoned with. While the  gains won are barely a beginning in  fighting against women's poverty, the  victory lies in affirming for all of us that  women do have the power to take back  the political agenda.

In June, the New Democratic government tabled legislation to restrict the  harassment of anti-choice protesters outside the places where women access abortion services. The Access to Abortion  Services Act sets up safe access zones  around abortion clinics, doctors' offices  and the homes of doctors and abortion  service providers.  Within these zones, people using or  providing abortion services may not be  harassed, photographed or interfered  with either physically or verbally, or subjected to protests on the issue of abortion.  The Act sets out access zones of ten  metres from offices of doctors providing  abortions; up to 50 metres (half a block)  from clinics providing abortions; and  160 metres from the homes of doctors  and service providers. The Act provides  penalties for violation of these safety  zones of a fine up to $5000 and maximum  six month jail term for a first offence; and  a minimum fine of $1000 and a jail sentence of up to one year for a second  offence.  Outside of the safe access zones, the  Act also prohibits anyone from approaching, following or watching another person providing abortion services, or from exhibiting threatening behaviour in person, by telephone or  through other electronic means, with  the intentof dissuading them from providing those services.  Joy Thompson of the BC Coalition  for Abortion Clinics (BCCAC) says she  is thrilled and delighted with the legislation. "It's been a long time in coming.  This legislation sends a clear message to  the public at large and to anti-choice  protesters that they don't have the right  tointerfere with individuals going about  conducting their own business."  Penny Priddy, BC's minister of  women's equality says that her government has always stood for the principle  of choice with regard to reproductive  health services. "This legislation ensures that commitment and that women's access to abortion services will be  protected and maintained."  The new legislation is the first and  only one of its kind in Canada.  Anti-choice activities have gone beyond mere leafletting and placard waving to threats, force, hostilities and violence. The Everywoman's Health Cen  tre in Vancouver has been consistently  targetted by anti-choice harassment tactics. And earlier this year, Garson  Romalis, a Vancouver gynecologist who  performs abortions, was shot twice in  the leg while at his home.  "This is not peaceful protest or  merely information dissemination," says  Thompson.  As expected by pro-choice activists,  just as the legislation was introduced,  anti-choice protesters cried foul and  screamed, "freedom of speech."  Joy Thompson responds that it is an  issue of equality, justice and humanity,  and not of free speech. "Targetting people at the point of accessing services is  not a freedom of speech issue, rather, it's  a targetting of those who are most vulnerable."  Priddy says her government did  seek a legal opinion on the issue of  whether the Act would withstand a constitutional challenge. The response was  that the legislation does not violate an  individual's freedom of expression.  Joy Thompson says one of the key  features of the legislation is that the  definition of "service providers" was  expanded to include not just doctors  and healthcare professionals, but also  lay counsellors, volunteer advocates and  security people around clinics. This is  critical, Thompson says, because most  of those service providers are women.  Penny Priddy says the legislation  comes about from the powerful voices  of women and men service providers  fighting for the rights of women, and of  women who've come forward with their  stories [of accessing and providing abortion services].  "We hope this legislation will send a  positive message to services providers  about their own safety to ensure that  women, particularly in smaller communities, have access to abortion services,"  she says. Priddy notes that there has  been a decrease in the number of doctors  providing abortion services in BC, in  both urban and rural areas.  The legislation has just passed second reading and will be sent to a legislature committee for review. Priddy says  there is no doubt that it will be passed  into law before the provincial legislature  recesses for the summer.  The opposition Liberal partyhasyet  to come up with their opinion of the new  legislation. Liberal leader Gordon  Campbell has admitted there is a split in  hiscaucus on the issue of abortion rights.  Supreme Court of Canada decision in Egan and Nesbitt:  Mixed message on lesbian rights  by Shannon e. Ash  Lesbians have received a mixed message from the Supreme Court of Canada  about their rights. In its decision handed  down on May 25, the Court ruled that the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms bars  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but that lesbians and gays can  be excluded from certain spousal benefits.  Lesbian and gay rights activists have  celebrated the former and criticized the  latter.  The specific case the Supreme Court  dealt with involved Jim Egan and Jack  Nesbitt, two gay men who have been  partners for over 40 years but who were  denied a spousal allowance under the  Old Age Security Act.  In its decision, the Court was unanimous in ruling that sexual orientation is  included as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the equality provisions of the Charter. While the Ontario  Court of Appeal ruled in 1992 that sexual  orientation should be "read in" to the  Charter, and the Canadian Human Rights  Commission has been taking complaints  of discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation since then, the Supreme  Court's ruling is seen as a confirmation of  human rights protection for lesbians and  gays. The federal government has still  not legislated this protection into the  Canadian Human Rights Act.  On the specific issue of same-sex  benefits, the Court split 5-4 on whether  Egan and Nesbitt were entitled to the  old age spousal allowance. The Act  specifies a definition of spouse that excludes same-sex couples.  Of the five judges who ruled against  Egan and Nesbitt, four said that denying a spousal benefit  wasnot discrimination,  while the fifth justice  agreed with the minority position that the Act  wasdiscriminatory,but  said that this discrimination was justifiable.  The majority judges argued that the Old Age  Security Act was meant  to protect poor older  women in heterosexual  relationships who had  worked in the home  and had no other pension support.  Diana Smith of the Lesbian and Gay  Benefits Society says that "many heterosexual families aren't the model of  what the law is supposed to protect, but  they get the benefit anyway." And, she  says, the argument that denying lesbians and gays spousal benefits isn't discrimination doesn't wash. "What is a  lesbian? It's having a sexual orientation  toward someone else," says Smith. If  her relationship is not recognized, then  Had it been  Jane Egan and  Joanne Nesbitt  would the  Court have  found in their  favour?  —Sunera Thobani  a woman is not being recognized as a  lesbian.  National Action Committee on the  Status of Women president, Sunera  Thobani asks, "had it been Jane Egan  and Joanne Nesbitt would the Court  have found in their favour? Or is it that  poor older women matter only if they're  heterosexual? Are they re-  ally interested in poor  women? Their derision on  Thibaudeau suggests they  are not." [see article, page 3]  On a positive note, a  majority of the Supreme  Court did rule that it is  discriminatory not to extend benefits to same-sex  couples, but it was a slim  majority. Still, Smith believes it could have a positive legal effect on other  spousal benefits cases, but  cautions that "we have yet  to see how successful that  will be." Spousal benefits are being negotiated in some cases without legal  struggles—with some private sector employers and recently for the Canadian  Union of Postal Workers (CUPW).  Egan and Nesbitt have said that  they are not in financial need of the  benefit, but are concerned with having  their relationship recognized. Smith  agrees that the struggle for same-sex  spousal benefits is a "way to fight  homophobia."  She does acknowledge the concern  that the spousal benefits system may  benefit only a few lesbian and gay couples who most resemble the traditional  heterosexual marriage. It might be better, she says, to distribute benefits based  on relationships of "emotional and financial interdependence. Family law in  general seems to be quite outdated."  However, Smith believes the lesbian and gay community should not  have to hold the ball and fight for fairer  benefits for everybody. "We have our  hands full fighting homophobia...We  could join with other groups" to fight for  fairer legislation.  In other recent decisions affecting  lesbian rights, Bill C-41—a federal bill to  increase penalties for hate crimes, including gay-bashing—was passed, and  legislation was introduced by the BC  provincial government on adoption  which will allow lesbian and gay couples to adopt children.  The Lesbian and Gay Benefits Society  holds ivorkshops on homophobia in the  workplace. They have recently published a  training manual for workshop facilitators,  "Time for Change: Recognizing the Rights  of Lesbian Workers."

JULY/AUGUST 1995 News  International Day of Action for Women's Health:  Keeping our breasts healthy  by Caitlin McMorran Frost   The health of our breasts is an issue  of major concern to women, and yet we  know so little about how to keep our  breasts healthy and what our options  are when we find out they are not. Breast  cancer is a reality for one in nine Canadian women and touches all our lives  whether we face the disease ourselves,  through someone we love, or simply as  a part of the risk group because we are  women and we have breasts.  While many organizations, groups  and individual women do work hard in  their own ways to address the issues of  breast cancer and breast health, we still  face limited funding and a deficit in  research. We also lack a coordinated  multi-faceted approach to dealing with  breast health that considers all of our  physical and emotional needs—that considers our breasts as part of who we are  in the many contexts that they take part  in our lives, as part of our sexual identity, as nourishment for our children,  and so on. As women, we still find ourselves having to make crucial decisions  that affect our breast health and our  overall health, without the information  and support we need.  Every year, on May 28th, women  around the world celebrate the International Day of Action for Women's  Health—a day for initiating local and  regional action toward improving women's health. This year, the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective held a day  long forum; "Healthy Breasts: Women  Taking Action," bringing together grassroots and medical women and organiza  tions to share information and initiate  action around breast health.  For two months preceding the forum, a working group of women presenting a range of community women's  and health groups came together to share  ideas and work toward a comprehensive action plan. This process has led to  strong links between individual women  and groups with the clear aim of addressing a wide range of women'shealth  needs.  The goal of the forum was to provide breast health information and dialogue that incorporates both a political  analysis as well as traditional and non-  traditional approaches to breast care,  prevention and treatment. The stage was  set for the day with an opening panel  called "The Breast in Cultural Context"  with discussion of the ways culture affects how we view and care for our  breasts. The panel included a historical  analysis looking at the medical view of  the breast as an 'oversized gland' and  the objectification of the breast, and a  presentation on Indo-Canadian perspectives on breast health and breast feeding  by Ranjit Dhari of the Vancouver Health  Department. The overall impact of cultural presures on breast feeding was  also discussed.  Other panels included a focus on  "Keeping Our Breasts Healthy" with a  strong environmental perspective from  Miranda Holmes of the Save Georgia  Straight Alliance, followed by practical  breast health nutritional advice from  herbalist Chanchel Cabara.

In a strong and emotional speech, MacPhee offered hope,  advice and inspiriation and called for  more action on the disease that is claiming so many women. With so much to  think about and so much pain, the inspiring voices of the Vancouver Lesbian  and Gay Choir lifted our spirits and  gave us the strength for the rest of the  afternoon.  The afternoon session provided an  opportunity for women to have their  questions aboutbreastcanceraddressed  by a panel of doctors, oncologists and  survivors. Questions ranged from how  to do daily tasks after mastectomy, the  safety of mammograms, to what to tell  young children when you find out you  have breast cancer. The panel offered an  opportunity to consider many of the  different aspects of dealing with breast  cancer, and the chance to discuss it from  a range of perspectives.  The final session brought together  all the different elements from the days  work and moved the information into a  space of action. Representatives from  the action planning coalition put forward the outline of the proposed Action  Plan for Breast Health.  The Action Plan is the product of the  work of many Vancouver women from  different backgrounds, experiences, organizations and perspectives, who  joined together in the belief that women  need access to a solid and diverse base of  information, that we need to create dialogue, and that we must coordinate our  action to support women in need to  make real change happen.  Lynn Redenbach, r.p.n.  Therapy for  Adult & Adolescent Women  ► relationships  j weight preoccupation & eating disorders  1 trauma & abuse issues  (604) 944-2798  The Action Plan has six components  for community action: education for  young women (to raise awareness and  try to prevent disease); education for  women over 50 (who are in a higher risk  category for breast cancer); an environmental lobby (which recognizes the links  between environmental issues and  health); a clearinghouse for information  on breast health (to provide quick and  comprehensive support to women in  need); a lobby to address the links between poor diet and fast food and breast  health problems; and a lobby to support  alternative therapy research (to recognize the need for a range of treatment  and health options beyond the medical  model).  The coalition will continue to meet  and organize, and will investigate resources to support the Action Plan. The  forum gave us all a great deal to think  about, and a great deal to act on. While  the Action Plan is a first step toward  coordinated action, it is an important  one, and was recognized as such by  participants who were very clear that it  is real action that is needed—action to  meet the needs of the women who are  facing breast cancer now, and action to  prevent more women having to face it in  the future.

A message from the Public Service Alliance of Canada   •   (604) 430-5631  JULY/AUGUST 1995 News  Provincial election in Ontario:  Right turn leads to dead end  by Judy Rebick  Women and progressive people in Ontario were left reeling after the province  elected a right-wing premier. On June 8,  Mike Harris and his Progressive Conservative party swept away the New Democratic  (NDP) government winning a majority of  the seats in the provincial legislature.  ' The Conservatives claimed 82 seats in  the 130-seat legislature with 45 percent of  the popular vote. The Liberal party came in  second, winning 30 seats, while the NDP  dropped out of government to third-party  status, managing to win only 17 seats. Before the election, the NDP held 74 seats in the  ernment five years ago was an indication that voters were looking for an  alternative to the tweedle dee and  tweedle dum of Conservative and Liberal policies that meant less and less  opportunity and hope for the majority of  people.  But Bob Rae did not deliver a different kind of government. The NDP government failed to deliver tax reform,  Judy Rebick, former president of the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women and co-host of CBC Newsworld's  Face Off, provides Kinesis with her analysis of the reasons behind Mike Harris' win,  and of what people in Ontario can expect  from his right-wing agenda.  Rather than the 'Common Sense  Revolution,' Ontario's new premier Mike  Harris might better call his program the  'Counter Revolution.' On the surface,  Harris plans to eliminate the few positive measures adopted by Bob Rae's  New Democratic government. If Harris'  agenda were only to roll back a few  pieces of legislation passed by the NDP,  I, for one, would not be so worried. The  reality is that Harris was swept into  power on a wave of anger and frustration at the disadvantaged in society—  who are being blamed for all the economic and social problems in Ontario. It  is Harris' ability to speak to the anger  and frustration of much of the working  class and middle class that makes his  government so dangerous to all of us  who value social justice and equality.  At the beginning of the election,  Harris was a distant second trailing Lyn  McLeod's Liberals who appeared to be  riding on the coattails of prime minister  Jean Chretien. Harris' 'Common Sense  Revolution' had been out for a year  before the election, and was mostly ridiculed by the press. The general pundit  wisdom—including on the Right—was  that Ontario was too moderate to elect  someone with such a radical right-wing  agenda.  Harris' most popular campaign  pledges were:  •a 30% tax cut (in the provincial portion  of taxes);  • mandatory work for welfare recipients  (workfare);  • the repeal of the "quota bill" (Ontario's  new employment equity bill, which far  from having quotas has almost no real  enforcement mechanism); and  •the repeal of Bill 40 (the anti-scab labour bill that also makes it easier to  organize the service sector).  While it is true that both the NDP  and the Liberals ran lacklustre campaigns, there is no question in my-mind  that voters were attracted by Harris'  program. The decline in Ontario in real  income and quality of life over the past  ten years due to neo-conservative policies has created an anger and frustration  in voters. The election of an NDP gov-  was the failure of the Rae government to  provide a left alternative to frustrated  voters looking for change that set the  stage for the Harris 'Counter Revolution.'  There were some areas where the  NDP government did keep its promises—employment equity legislation,  which although weak was a step forward; expansion of pay equity; funding  It was the failure of the Rae government to  provide a left alternative to frustrated voters  looking for change that set the stage for the  Harris 'Counter Revolution.'  which they promised in setting up their  Fair Tax Commission. [The Commission was established to review the provincial tax system and recommended,  among other things, a minimum corporate tax rate. The NDP failed to implement a number of the Commission's  recommendations and moderated a lot  of its recommendations.]  The NDP failed to democratize government to respond to the increasing  desire among the population to have  more accountable government. They  of abortion clinics, women's centres and  transition houses; and appointments to  the judiciary and various goverment  agencies of women, people of colour,  Aboriginal people and people with disabilities.  Now, all of these measures are at  risk. Even more importantly, Harris'  promise to undo everything Rae has  done will mean that much of his fire will  bedirected againstpoor people, women,  people of colour, Aboriginal people and  people with disabilities—as these are  Harris' promise to undo everything Rae has done  will mean that much of his fire will be directed  against poor people, women, people of colour,  Aboriginal people and people with disabilities...  broke their promises, like bringing in  public auto insurance, and defended  unethical behavior among their cabinet  ministers. They even joined the unjustified attack on poor people by hiring two  hundred welfare cops to ferret out welfare fraud.  But most importantly, instead of  stand ing up to the barrage of attack from  Bay Street—home to corporate Ontario  and most of corporate Canada—and mobilizing their supporters for the struggle  against savage capitalism, the NDP caved  in to the right-wing attacks and betrayed  their supporters with a social contract  that violated the basic principle of trade  unionism and free collective bargaining.  [The social contract passed by the legis-  the people who did see gains some under Rae's government. Even Harris' use  of the term 'quota bill' to describe employment equity legislation is a barely  disguised appeal to the rising racism  and sexism in the province.  Harris' first moves were to appoint  a woman as the top bureaucrat and to  announce that as soon as his cabinet  meets he will cut welfare benefits by 20  percent. The appointment of a woman in  this powerful position is meant to calm  the fears of professional women that  Harris' election is the resultof abacklash  against women's equity rights. With this  election, the representation Of women in  the Ontario legislation plummeted from  22 to 14 percent.  Harris will move to hit us hard, hit us fast, and  he won't even blink.  lature in July 1993 imposed wage restraints and rollbacks on public sector  workers.]  There will no doubt be recriminations against those in the labour  movment—like the Canadian Auto  Workers' president Buzz Hargrove—  who decided to sit out the election rather  than support an NDP government that  had so betrayed labour. In the end, it  Harris' agenda will hurt women  more than any other group—especially  poor and marginalized women. Welfare  cuts and workfare [mandatory work for  people receiving welfare] will affect single mothers more than any other group.  While Harris has said he will exempt  single mothers with children under the  age of three from workfare, single mothers with older children will be cut off  welfare if they choose to stay home and  care for their children instead of going  out and raking leaves or participating in  other workfare projects.  Workfare will provide cheap labour  for employers, putting a downward pressure on already low wages in the service  sector. Workfare will mean unemployment for some people working in low  income areas and lower wages for others. And most of these workers are  women.  Repeal for employment equity legislation will create a climate where hiring and promoting women, people of  colour, Aboriginal people, and people  with disabilities will no longer be seen as  priorities. While the legislation itself is  weak, it nevertheless set into motion a  process of employers' examining barriers to hiring and promoting the four  designated groups. Similarly, repeal of  the labour bill will make it much harder  to organize women in the service sector.  But Harris' rapid move to cut welfare benefits is even more troubling. It  may be true that Ontario's benefits are  higher than other provinces, but so is the  cost of living in cities like Toronto and  Ottawa. Cuts in benefits will mean more  homeless people and longer lines at food  banks. And the more visible poverty is,  the more vulnerable poor people are to  attack.  These are the politics of polarization  so clearly displayed in [US Senate majority leader] Newt Gingrich's 'Contract  on America'—cut the poor off assistance, force them into crime, then build  bigger prisons. By turning citizens' anger against poor people, the Harris government will attempt to sidetrack people from his real agenda—to increase  benefits for the already rich people. The  30 percent tax cut will primarily benefit  those in high income brackets, partial  larly because Harris intends to rescind  the health tax on employers and put it  back on individual tax payers. [Currently, the costs of the Ontario Health  Insurance Plan are paid for through taxes  on employers.] No doubt Harris will  also make liberal use of user fees of  various sorts, so middle income people  will see little, if any, net gain.  'What is to be done,' as someone  once said. Ontario delegates to the Annual General Meeting of the National  Action Committee on the Status of  Women have called a demonstration for  June 26, the day the Harris government  is to be sworn in. Social movements  should learn from the experience of Alberta and New Zealand—Harris will  move to hit us hard, hit us fast> and he  won't even blink.  There is no time for balance sheets,  defenders of social equity have to move  just as fast in organizing visible opposition. We have to convince Harris, and  more importantly his Bay Street backers, that the price to pay for rolling back  the gains made by the last two generations of workers, women, people of colour, Aboriginal people, and people with  disabilities will be too high.

The first meeting of the Violence in  Lesbian Relationships committee is  scheduled for Wednesday, July 5, from  6:30 to 8:30pm at the VLC, 876 Commercial Drive. |  To participate in the advisory committee of for more information contact Sonya  Boyce, 254-2052, Tina Hurd, 254-8458.  Domestic worker  conference  A conference of Domestic Workers  will be held in Vancouver from August  5th to 7th. This gathering is a follow-up  to the 1994 domestic workers conference held in Ontario, and sponsored by  INTERCEDE, the Toronto domestic  workers' rights organization.  At the 1994 Conference, domestic  workers and their supporters launched  the Points Campaign to push for the  rights of domestic workers in Canada.  The campaign included petitions to scrap  the $975 immigrant head tax.  This year's conference is being sponsored by the Vancouver Committee for  Domestic Workers' and Caregivers'  Rights (an INTERCEDE affiliate). The  agenda for the conference will include  assessing the status of the Points Campaign, sharing experiences about domestic worker services, and organizing  for the 4th World Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing in September.  For more information, contact Julie or  Lorina at (604) 874-0649.  Next writers'  meeting on  Tuesday August  1st at our office.  Come brainstorm  for our next issue!!  JULY/AUGUST 1995 What's News  by Lissa Geller  New law allows same-  sex adoption  After years of lobbying from various  groups, the British Columbia government has introduced legislation that will  bring sweeping changes to the province's  Adoption Act.  The proposed amendments to the  Act will regulate private adoptions; allow lesbian, gay and common law couples to adopt; and substantially increase  the information available to adoptees  about their birth families.  Current legislation in BC allows only  single people and legally married couples to adopt, and gays and lesbians are  not allowed to adopt each other's children. By granting same-sex couples the  same adoption rights as other couples,  the government has "moved us another  step towards equality" said gay United  Church minister Tim Stevenson.  However, barbara findlay, a human  rights lawyer and member of the December 9th Coalition, a lesbian and gay legal  rights group, says the provincial government did not have a great deal of choice  in the matter. "The Supreme Court of  Canada has said it is illegal for govern-  ments to discriminate against lesbian and  gay partners. The courts in Ontario have  recently held that means that lesbians  and gay men cannot constitutionally be  forbidden to adopt."  The legislation also increases regulations for private adoptions. Under the  new law, anyone applying to adopt must  undergo a screening process including a  home study, criminal record check and a  personal reference check.  Adoption rights advocates are also  pleased that the law will allow adoptees  greater access to their own adoption  records. When BC passed its current  Adoption Act in 1957, birth mothers  had few options when it came to planning for their children and many were  influenced by the society's condemnation of unwed mothers.  Concern has been expressed, however, that the new legislation could violate the privacy rights of birth mothers.  The government intends to engage in  an education process with existing and  potential birth mothers to inform them  that the adoption records of their children will be opened upon the request of  the child when they reach the age of  majority. However, critics charge that  this amounts to "negative marketing"  since women will have to specifically  opt out of information sharing if they  do not want to be contacted in the  future.  The new legislation has met with  the usual oppositionfrom the rightwing,  because of the inclusion of adoption by  lesbian and gay couples. The opposition Liberal Party is divided, and has  agreed to allow members a free vote in  the legislature. But with the only vehement oppositioncoming from the small  Reform Party caucus, the legislation is  likely to pass in this session of the House  without much commotion.  Kiss and Tell wins  Lambda award  Her Tongue on My Theory, created  by the Kiss and Tell collective and published by Press Gang Publishers of Vancouver, has become the first Canadian-  published book ever to win a Lambda  Literary Award. Kiss and Tell is a lesbian feminist collective in Vancouver  made up of Lizard Jones, Susan Stewart  and Persimmon Blackbridge.  The Lambda awards, presented by  the Lambda Book Report of Washington, DC, are given to ^recognize and  honour lesbian and gay literary excellence. More than 360 publishing people,  booksellers and writers gathered in Chicago at the American Booksellers Association Convention to witness the presentation of the 20 awards.  This year was the first in which  Canadianbooks were eligible tobenomi-  nated for the "Lammies." One other  Canadian book was nominated in 1995,  The Very Inside, edited by Sharon Lim-  Hing and published by Toronto's Sister  Vision Press. The book, an anthology of  writings by Asian and Pacific Islander  lesbians and bisexual women, was nominated in the Lesbian and Gay Anthologies/Fiction category.  Nominated in both the Small Press  and Lesbian Studies categories, Her  Tongue on My Theory beat out stiff US  competition to win in the Small Press  category.  The catalyst for Her Tongue was Kiss  and Tell's multi-media performance True  Inversions, which was performed in western Canada in 1992 and received widespread publicity following the publication of a critical column by a homophobic  syndicated reporter. The ensuing backlash inspired the Kiss and Tell to create  a "daring collage of lesbian sexual imagery, erotic stories and provocative  analysis imbued with humour."  Settlement for breast  implants  In response to numerous suits  brought by women in Canada, the international pharmaceutical company Bristol-Meyers Squibb has negotiated an out-  of-court settlement with women who  used their silicone gel breast implants.  Only women in Quebec and Ontario are  eligible for this settlement since they are  the only two provinces with class action  legislation. [The BC government recently  proposed legislation to allow class action suits [see Kinesis, June 1995].]  A lawyer associated with the case,  Michael Eizenga, noted that the effects  of the settlement could be more far-  reaching than just the two provinces,  particularly since it might encourage  other manufacturers to reach settlements  with women.  Under the terms of the settlement,  Bristol-Meyers Squibb agrees to pay out  over $28 million to women who've suffered health problems from their silicon  gel implants. Problems may range from  the hardening of the breasts to autoimmune disorders to cancer. The money  will be paid out over 12 years and will  likely be administered by an insurance  company.  An advertising campaign will inform womennot involved in the original  class action suit that they may have a  claim to compensation if they suffered  from any illnesses commonly attributed  to breast implants, and if their implants  were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC), a subsidiary of Bristol-Meyers Squibb. Approximately 20-25 percent of women in  Canada with breastimplantsare thought  to have ones manufactured by the company.  Fourth World Conference on Women:  Out of site, out of mind  by Smita Patil   Women won some and lost some in  their demand that China find an appropriate site for the UN NGO Women's  Forum or else lose the opportunity to  host the forum, along with the 4th UN  World Conference on Women.  Following recent negotiations, it  seems China will continue to host the  conference and the NGO Forum in September, but will grant visas to the up to  40,000 women participants registered,  up from 20,000 women, the previous  limitation they had imposed. Thisnumber  is supposed to include Tibetan women,  prostitutes and lesbians—three groups  China has been reluctant to allow in.  As well, China's conference organizers say they will try to address some of  the logistical problems associated with  the new site they have proposed for the  NGO Women's Forum—a feat most  women say may not be possible in the  time left before the forum begins on August 30th.  It all began less than five months  before the conference and overlapping  NGO Women's Forum were scheduled  to take place in Beijing. The conference  and forum preparations had been almost  three years in the making when the  Chinese government apparently realized having tens of thousandsof women  activists descend on its capital city  would not be such a good idea.  Abruptly, and apparently without  consultation with the UN, they moved  the site of the NGO Women's Forum  from Beijing to a rural town, Huairou,  which is 60 kilometres outside Beijing.  The excuse given was that the Workers'  Stadium site in Beijing originally scheduled to house the forum is structurally  unsafe. However, the stadium continues to host and hold bookings for major  sports events both before and after September. The only cancellation has been  the NGO Women's Forum.  As well, China has refused to consider alternate sites in Beijing, such as  theCapital Gymnasium and sites within  the Asian Games Village, which is where  the conference will take place.  Women launched an international  protest, successfully lobbying the UN  and several national governments, including Canada, Australia, and New  Zealand, to challenge the Chinese government's overt attempt to sabotage  NGO efforts to lobby at the world conference.  Since much of the language of the  documents to come out of the conference has yet to be agreed upon, the  access of NGO representatives to the  conference is crucial. But with about  1,300 NGOs (almost 40,000 women) accredited by the UN to attend the NGO  Forum, transportation from the Huairou  site to and from Beijing is expected to be  a logistical nightmare.  As well, the new site in Huairou has  no space big enough for women to hold  plenary meetings, and inadequate facilities for translation, interpretation and  communication. The site also is not accessible to women with disabilities.  China has now agreed to provide  additional buildings, tents and spaces in  Huairou, so that all activities registered  can be accommodated. As well, they  will provide a second "satellite" site in  Beijing (50 square metres of space) near  the conference site for NGO representatives to meet. There will also be up to  3,500 international phone lines set up in  Huairou, and arrangements for bus service between Huairou and Beijing.  But the main problem of the remoteness and inadequacy of the new site  remain. Contact between NGOs, media  and governments will be extremely difficult to maintain.  Mostwomenandgroupsfromacross  the world have mixed feelings about the  compromise reached between China and  the UN organizers of the conference. But  the possibility of a boycott of the conference is being dismissed by most, largely  because it may be counter-productive at  this stage. Women say they will attempt  to work around the difficulties and get  on with organizing, mobilizing, lobbying and making changes.

Accordingtosomeofthe350women  who attended the AGM, this news was  partly why the atmosphere at this AGM  was more quiet than usual. Others attributed the tense but subdued atmosphere to activist exhaustion following a  busy year of fighting back against proposed and actual social program cuts  and the stepping up of assaults on  women, the poor, immigrants, people of  colour, people with disabilities, single  mothers, youth and the unemployed.  Still others attributed it to the conference organizers, and the fact that time  and space was structured to allow  women to meet in small groups to discuss and clarify the key policy matters  before coming together to vote on them.  A highpoint of the AGM, titled There  is Another Way: Women Fight Back, was  when the women, representing NAC's  600 member groups, re-elected Sunera  Thobani as president for her second two-  year term. Another camewhen Francoise  David of the Federation des Femmes du  Quebec described the activity of the  women who organized and participated  in the ten-day, cross-Quebec, anti-poverty march in May/June. When the anthem Du Pain et des Roses (Bread and  Roses) played at the end of her speech,  the women at the AGM spontaneously  roseinastandingdvation,holdinghands  as they sang the refrain [see article, page 4;  and speech, page 12.]  Delegates also elected three new  vice-presidents who will serve on this  year's executive: Vancouver Status of  Women'sMicheHill;MarianneRoyfrom  Solidarite Populaire Quebecand CUSO-  Quebec; and Sue Genge, a representative of the Canadian Labour Congress.  The new treasurer elected was Joan  Grant-Curnrnings of Toronto's Women's Health in Women's Hands. Members at large elected were: Amy Go of the  Chinese Canadian Council; Nandita  Sharma from numerous organizations  in Vancouver, nominated by Women to  Women Global Strategies; Vuyiswa B.  Keyi-Ayema of Women's Health in  Women's Hands and Keyi Consulting  Services; and Shree Mulay, a second-  time member-at-large from the South  Asian Women's Community Centre in  Montrealand a co-organizer of this year's  NAC AGM.  After meeting in small discussion  groups to evaluate and discuss NAC's  work in 1995-6, the membership chose  to continue to make social policy reform  a priority campaign for NAC. Tentatively titled: "There is Another Way:  Social Justice and Equality," the campaign will be regionally based, and is to  include educational, media, action and  lobbying strategies. The second priority  campaign adopted is an organizational  development review of NAC, intended  to develop a more effective infrastructure within the organization. A consultant has been hired to conduct the review, and the membership is to be kept  informed of developments over the year.  A key resolution was to move more  quickly on incorporating anti-racism  measures throughout N AQparticularly  by ensuring all NAC committees be co-  chaired by a woman of colour.  There were numerous resolutions  on social policy, including that NAC  oppose the Canada Health and Social  Transfer block funding proposal. Resolutions also passed called for opposition  to new anti-immigrant, racist measures.  There were also numerous resolutions  on violence against women (some of  which had to be passed by the executive  due to lack of time on the floor). [Kinesis  will have more on these resolutions in  upcoming issues.]  An unprecedented number of resolutions on environmental issues were  passed on the floor. In an emergency  resolution, NAC groups voted unanimously to stand in solidarity with Innu  women in the Labrador communities of  Davis Inlet and Sheshatshiu in their struggle against genocide caused by military  jets flying low-level over their  territory, as well as for the  cessation of minerals exploration on Innu territory before a proper assessment and  consultation with the Innu  takes place.  Present at the AGM to  speak to the resolutions was  Katie Rich, the first woman  chief of Davis Inlet. Rich was  also the recipient of the 1995  NAC Woman of Courage  award. /Kinesis will publish  excerpts of her speech in the  September 1995 issue.]  About 100 women stayed  for the annual post-AGM  lobby on Parliament hill with  the federal political parties.  NAC women sent a loud  message to the Liberal government that NAC will not  allow them to continue to  renege on their Red Book  promises [containing their  pre-election promises], in  particular those having to do  with social programs, immigration, childcare, violence  against women, and lesbian and gay  rights.  In our meeting with the Bloc  Quebecois, NAC women demanded the  Bloc play a stronger role in opposing  social program cuts outside Quebec.  The Reform party again refused to  meet with NAC this year...or that's what  we thought until a "tanned" Preston  Manning—looking suspiciously like  South Asian actress Sheila James of The  Company of Sirens—showed up. James  as Manning, together with masked Re-  ! form Party members Myron Thompson  (Judy Rebick,) Art Hanger (Anne  Mcgrath,) Jan Brown (Andrea Ritchie,)  Herb Grubel (Linda Chen) and Deborah  Grey (Kike Roach) had the NAC delegation in fits of laughter as they spoofed  the right-wing party's positions on race,  gender, poverty and sexual orientation.  In response to one heckler in the  audience—"Why don't you have repre-  Top: Preston Manning, aka Sheila James,  with Sunera Thobani and Marianne Roy.  Below: Reform Party MPs, aka some wildly  funny NAC women. Photos by Fatima Jaffer.  sentatives of people of colour in your  caucus?"—Manning/James retorted:  "We have Jan Brown and Deborah Grey.  They're women of colour."  Other Manning/James retorts included: "I've purged the party of open  racists. Notthatl'vegot anything against  racists. I just don't want them speaking  openly."  "What I'm mad about is that the  Liberals are dismantling the health system and we're not getting any credit for  it."  And, "Glad to see you all acting so  nice and ladylike this year," referring of  course to NAC's demonstration against  the Reform Party last year, which resulted in a media backlash against NAC  for its "radical" behaviour.

All-purpose progressives"  by Kik6 Roach  Kike" Roach isasteeringcommitteemem-  ber of the African-Canadian Youth Initiative and the Women's Coalition for Employment Equity, and is a former member of the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Womenexecutive.Thefollowingisexcerpted  from her presentation on the closing panel  "Thinking Globally, Fighting Locally" of  NAC's annual general meeting in June.  Listening this whole weekend to the  voices of women talking about their  struggles, about the attacks we are facing, the assaults on us, my head is spinning. And I want to talk about it all—I  want it all at one time [laughter].  It seems to me that so many parallels  were crystallized. A great analogy came  to the fore in thinking about the story of  Audrey Smith.  Audrey Smith was alone, waiting  for a bus in downtown Toronto. She is a  poor Black woman from Jamaica who  came to Canada, ironically, for a rest.  She came to Canada to visit her friends  and family. Waiting alone for the bus,  she was soon encircled by three racist,  white cops who saw only axcriminal  before them, not the mother of five children, a hardworking mother.  They surrounded her, accused her  of having drugs on her, and within minutes, she found herself—one late evening  in the summer on a public street—  stripped naked, stripped naked on a  public street by three racist white cops.  And I thought about the parallel—I  thought about how we, as African  women, have been stripped from the  continent of Africa; how we've had our  identity stripped away from us; how  we've had our rights stripped away from  us; how we've had the control of our  bodies stripped away from us; how  we've been left naked and vulnerable to  white male supremacist power and violence for too long.  I thought about the police who are  supposed to serve and protect everyone, and how they not only abdicated  their responsibility but left the woman  open, vulnerable through a racist, sexual,  terrorist act.  And I thought about the Canadian  government, and how it has abdicated  its responsibility to its citizens, how it's  left us stripped naked of basic human  rights, so that the flesh of equality is  exposed to corporate crows who are  picking away at us, bit by bit.  I thought about the fighting spirit of  Audrey Smith, who wasn't going to take  this crap lying down. I thought about  how she took her grievance to the police,  to the police complaints commission. I  thought about how three tribunals have  come to the fore to try to deal with her  issue and each time, they've been disbanded for mysterious reasons. I thought  about how the laws are not set up to  work for us in the first place. I thought  about the diversion of her energy, having to come up and leave her children to  fight a battle that seemed like it was  never going to be won. I thought about  the fact that there was a witness to  Audrey Smith's strip-searching in public. That witness was Lycon Nelson, who  was himself a police officer in Jamaica. I  thought about the fact that as soon as the  police discovered that Audrey Smith  had a witness who could speak up and  bring the issue to justice, Lycon Nelson  was charged with possession of drugs  himself.  I thought about the way that we are  criminalized for pointing out crimes. I  thought about NAC and how NAC is a  witness to the injustices women are facing across this country; about how NAC  is speaking up to fight against these  injustices and is rewarded with the jingoistic journalism of flaky feminists, who  profited from women's struggles, only  to turn around and bash their feminist  sisters for as much as they could get out  of them [applause].  I thought about how it was no coincidence that NAC is being criminalized  for pointing out the crimes. I thought  about the fact that among the three police who surrounded Audrey Smith, one  of them was a woman, and that woman  was, sad to say, the most implicated in  getting Audrey Smith to take off her  clothes and be exposed. I thought about  how that woman contributed in part to  the pain and degradation of another  woman; how she left another woman  vulnerableand exposed and participated  in her own degradation. And I thought  about the times that we, in the women's  movement, turn against our sisters, turn  against the most vulnerable of our sisters and leave us exposed [applause] to be  attacked by this male supremacist system.  I thought about the fact that if  Audrey Smith can be violated so can I.  So can any one of you. I thought about  the corporate powers who say, "Well, if  we can exploit people in Mexico, if we  can exploit people in Africa, if we can  exploit people all over the world, why  not in Canada?" Why not? Why not  bring this disposable worker order mentality here to increase our bottom line?  I thought about how, the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force was rewarded  for its murder and harassment daily of  the most vulnerable communities by  having its budget of half a billion dollars  increased, while child care centres in  Metro Toronto were closed.  I thought about what thi s says about  our world economy [to quote Jeremy  Brucher] "an economy which doesn't  allow people to use their resources to  meet their needs, which allows tens of  millions of people to be unemployed  and underemployed while vast needs  go unmet; which allow human energy to  be squandered, destroying the environment and building weapons to defend  against countries which no longer exist  can surely be described as a stupid  economy." [laughter].  It is this stupid economy that violates the rights of women and other  living things. And I want to say I am sick  and tired of pro-poverty politicians and  bank bullies, who in their fiscal fanaticism and deficit dementia have sold our  futures out from under us, and I will not  take it anymore [applause].  Kike Roach.  Photo by Fatima Jaffer.  It is women who  will show this world  what democracy  means, what human  dignity means by  fighting back.  These cutbacks, that are done in the  name of my generation—the hypocrisy  of politicians sitting around and saying,  "We can't leave this next generation  with this terrible burden, this terrible  debt," so they want to close our schools  and shut down hospitals and leave us  lying in the streets with no jobs and no  future.  And I thought about the fact that I  want the debt problem addressed. I want  it addressed by having them realize that  this debt is owed to First Nations people  [applause]...and this is the way this debt  ought to be addressed.  I thought about how angry I am that  the Right is coopting our language., .that  Preston Manning is a "populist," and  DanQuayletalksaboufempowerment"  [laughter] and Mike Harris [newly elected  progressive conservative premier of  Ontario] is a "revolutionary" [laughter],  and I am angry that white men, rich  white men are "angry" [laughter, applause]. I am angry that they are making  poor white men angry at me, a potential  ally [applause].  And I'm sick at a program that turns  social scorn into social policy. As a descendant of slaves, I am tired of being  told that I am part of the problem. I am  sick of the privileging of private decisions on public issues. I am sick of Mike  Harris who thinks that of cou rse the rich  are the tiny overburdened minority,  thaf s discriminated against; that white  men are "quota law" victims, and that  the upper middle class has been too long  denied their basic rights to redecorate  their homes [laughter, applause]W\tin our  tax dollars.  We have to take back our language.  We cannot allow them to sully the beautiful word "revolution;" we have to call  it for what it is—scrapping the so-called  "quota law" [employment equity laws]  means returning the "affirmative action  for white men only." That's what it  means. We have to take out "workfare"  and call it "workforce." We have to say  that "open for business" means "open  season on workers' rights." We have to  say that Mike Harris supports "welfare", "well fare for the rich." We have to  say that Mike Harris is no "revolutionary;" he is "a human rights violator"  [applause]. We ha ve to say that he has not  come here to bring us a revolution; he  has come to kill the revolution we have  been pressing for for so many years—  the women's revolution that has won us  the rights to work and study, political  rights, economic rights. And we will not  allow him to do that.  We know that soon we are coming  to a time when there is going to be no  more time for letters to the legislature or  appealing with [Finance Minister Paul]  Martin. We are coming to a time when  we must build our movement with the  grassroots. We must not fall victim to  activist malpractice [laughter] which  means that, in our movement, we sweep  internal problems under the carpet. We  must build a movement that has a place  for a shared vision of all of us—we  cannot be divided on class lines, on  sexual orientation lines, we cannot be  divided by disability, by race. We must  struggle to be all-purpose progressives  who have an integrated analysis of how  all these oppressions work together to  prevent us from having our rights. But  these rights cannot be separated from  the rights of women living in Guatemala  or Serbia or Rwanda.  It is women who will show this  world what democracy means, what  human dignity means by fighting back.  We are already doing that with our  marches, our demonstrations.  I want to close with a quote from  Martin Luther King who said, "The  oceans of history are made turbulent by  ever-rising tides of hate. History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and  individuals who pursue this self-defeating path of hate." But we still have a  choice today. We have a chance to choose  between chaos or community." I think  we know which choice we could make  become a reality.  Maya Angelou says there is nothing  worse than a young cynic, because she  has gone from knowing nothing to believing in nothing. I stand before you  today saying I have learnt so much from  you, saying I have learnt so much from  all women who have struggled to give  me a piece of the freedom I enjoy today  and that I am full of hope and optimism  because I know [sings] "Soon and very  soon, we are going to change the  world...forever, and ever, we are going  to change the world."   Thanks to Fatima Jaffer for taping and  transcribing.  JULY/AUGUST 1995 Feature  Women's march against poverty:  15,000 roses in Quebec  by Francoise David  Francoise David is a longtime social  worker and community organizer in Montreal, Quebec. She has worked with the  Federation des associations de families  monoparentales du Quebec (Federation of  Associations of Single Parent Families) and  is currently president of the Federation des  Femmes du Quebec (FFQ). She was a key  organizer of the Women's March Against  Poverty in Quebec May 26-June 4. David  spoke at the opening panel at the annual  general meeting of the NationalAction Committee on the Status of Women in June. The  following is excerpted and translated from  her speech in French.  I was asked to speak to you about  the long march of women against poverty [applause]. It is important to stay  humble because the idea of a long march  like this does not only belong to women  in Quebec. I got the idea from Black  women in the civil rights movement in  the US in the 60s. I also know that a few  years ago in Peru, women of all ages  came down from their villages in the  Andes mountains and marched to the  capital to fight for better working conditions.  Two years ago, the FFQ questioned  its future and women wanted to do  some actions. When I got this idea of a  march, I presented it to my board who at  first thought I was kidding—"We are  not going to walk 250 kilometres!...and  so rapidly?" But we said "let's do it."  We started to prepare. The goal of  the march was adopted quite quickly by  all—to fight against women's poverty.  The issue of poverty is closely related to  that of violence against women, and  these are the two major issues that mobilize women in the movement in Quebec, and probably in Canada.  A year ago, when we had begun to  work more concretely, we said: "If we  want this march to work, all of us have  to be together—women from all groups,  all ages, all origins." This was extremely  important. So on March 19, 1994, the  FFQ, for the first time, got 22 women's  groups together—groups that in Quebec we call "national" or umbrella  groups. After the third meeting, we were  50 women from 50 "national" groups,  including delegates from all the regions  of Quebec. Theorganizationof themarch  reached a lot of women—the majority of  Quebec women are francophone, but  from the beginning there were women  from other communities—anglophones,  Natives from the Association des femmes  autochtones du Quebec, and women of  colour.  A big job was to determine what  demands we wanted to present to the  Quebec government. It was important  not to have a long grocery list with 40 or  50 demands if we wanted to be able to  measure our gains after the march. It  would have been discouraging to have  too many objectives and, after the march,  feel we had gained too little. The most  difficult part was choosing our priorities. It was done with a lot of goodwill on  the part of all the groups present. Decisions were made by consensus...we  didn't even argue!  We had criteria for how best to  choose and decide on demands. One  criteria was that the demands should be  within provincial jurisdiction. Another  criteria was that demands had to be  aimed directly at the issue of poverty  and facilitate economic autonomy for  women. Another criteria was to be able  to win those demands in the short term.  Finally, we wanted to have demands  that would touch or affect all women, or  almost all women.  Maybe women  would not feel all  the demands concerned them individually but at least  one, two or three of  the demands  would, [see list of  demands, page 4].  We presented  those demands to  the government on  December 7th. It  was interesting that  theQuebec government took six  months to think  about answers to  these demands.  They only started to  work seriously on  the answers two  months before the  march, because  they had found out  the march was going to be a success.  We had four times  the participation  we had expected. It  was clear women  from all areas of Quebec were united in  the effort to make the march a big event.  It was, I think, one of the most moving moments we have ever lived in the  Quebec women's movement. It was a  rich moment in terms of its meaning,  and its great success at bringing women  together.  As the person who had brought up  the idea of this walk, it was important  for me personally to walk in the march—  even if it meant working for ten days by  cellular phone (a horrible invention), to  stay in touch with the government and  the media. I was not able to walk the 250  kilometres but I walked about a 100 km,  and those were the best moments in" the  ten days. There were women there from  all walks of life. We had women aged 16  to 81 years. There were women from  large cities and from small villages; unionized women mostly from the public  sector; unemployed women and women  on social assistance; community activists; nuns. You would see a young radical student walking hand-in-hand with  an older nun, both of whom share a  strong commitment to fighting against  women's poverty but not necessarily  using the same strategies [laughter].  We were welcomed with extraordinary warmth in the towns and the villages. In Quebec, as in other provinces I  am sure, we found that thousands of  people, men and women, want social  change. That is very clear! People often  do not know how to go about it or who  to contact, but I saw people come out of  their houses, clap their hands, honk their  horns, and offer us water, flowers and  other encouragement. There was enormous trust between the marcheuses  (marchers) and the population. Mayors,  priests, town councils, MLAs—everybody came to see us. There was a real  feeling of solidarity and of the need for  social renewal.  Finally, we arrived in Quebec  City, where we  were expecting  about 10,000 people. We had at least  15,000. In my life  as an activist who  has participated in  about 100 demonstrations, this was  thebestever. There  was a celebration  with a lot of  women from a lot  of communities, as  well as with men  whofeltconcerned  with the march.  Visually, it was like  15,000 roses. It was  beautiful. But it  was more than  that—there was so  much emotion,  such enormous  pleasure at being  together, which  teaches us another  lesson about ways  to be militants.  Then, we  heard the results of our demands from  the Quebec government. Regarding the  raising the minimum wage, we got a  raise of 45 cents, which now makes our  rate equivalent with that in Ontario. But  it is much below what we were asking  for. The government did not make  friends with us when it announced this  meager raise—which is nevertheless the  biggest raise given at any time ever [applause].  As for our other demands, we made  some real gains. For example, the issue  of the reduction of the sponsorship period applied to all men and women who  came to Quebec before October 31,1994,  apart from immigrant women. The  marcheuses along with immigrant women  in Quebec, were euphoric about this  gain [applause].  We also had a firm commitment in  principle to get the employability programs or "workfare" in Quebec eliminated. This is where people who are on  income assistance work for nothing or  rather simply to get their UI cheque. We  got a firm commitment that all people  participating in employability programs  would at least get minimum wage and  that the Quebec labour law would apply  to them. If we look at the dominant  discourse in North America which is  very much in favor of workfare, I think  we won an extremely important gain,  although it is only applicable beginning  the end of 1996.  Francoise David, right, with Deb  O'Connor. Photo by Fatima Jaffer.  It was one of the most  moving moments we  have ever lived in the  Quebec women's  movement.  I won't list all the gains made because it would be a bit long, but basically  we say we scored 7 out of 9 points—not  counting the minimum wage demand.  We won the freeze on tuition fees for  students for this year, but have no guarantees for next year because, in part, of  the reduction of transfer payments [from  the federal government to provinces].  We also asked for a raise in the amount  of grants for youth because they have  responsibilities as parents, but the minister of education did not want to commit himself because they are currently  restructuring the student loans system.  It is clear, however, that we also  gained at another level—the rising force  of the women's movement. This is an  unvaluable gain because it means the  fight goes on. Even if we had scored 9  out of 9, we never expected poverty  would be eliminated on June 4 at 5pm.  So it was important that, after the march,  we would be left with a stronger, more  united movement to enable us to continue to fight everywhere.  The most important victory is we  succeeded in staying together for one  year without any major conflicts. What  allowed us to be in this good position to  continue the fight comes certainly from  the autonomy and the dignity that was  visible among the marcheuses. A lot of  people told us they were impressed at  the way we protested—it was firm, clear  and, at the same time, touched people in  their hearts.  In a wider political sense, it will  probably be said, most probably in The  Globe and Mail than in Le Devoir, that the  political situation in Quebec helped us.  This is clear to us—obviously when a  government wants to hold a referendum, it is better for them if half the  population feels like it is being heard.  There is space to make our demands.  There are also a few feminists in the  government who are our allies. But we  have to recognize it is to women we owe  the victory we are celebrating today. Itis  women who won this march and nobody else! [applause]  It is clear for us that the fight is far  from over. The major goals remain to be  attained. It has been difficult to organize  this march but in the end, it was relatively easy to centre our energies on an  event which had a start and an end.  What is difficult after is to remain  united; to not return to the day-to-day  routine where every movement is  apart—unions on one side, the popular  movement on another, and women on  another. We need to give ourselves clear  objectives. We need to channel the great  energy we felt during those ten days and  transform it into a determined political  force in Quebec.  This is the real challenge that  facinates as well as overwhelms us because it is huge. If we as women from  Quebec and other provinces, as women  and men of good will get together, the  governments will have to listen to us.

JULY/AUGUST 1995  i ^ :  j ; Feature  Women against anti-fertility vaccines:  The cost of trials & errors  by Agnes Huang  Women health activists from around  the world met in Ottawa to strategize  around stopping the research and development of immunological contraceptives  (alsoknownasantifertilityvaccines),and  to call for a radical re-orientation of contraceptive research.  In early June, 32 women gathered at  the International Action Meeting, organized by Women's Health Interaction  (WHI), Inter Pares and the National Action Committee on the Status of Women  (NAC), to further the work in the cam-  . paign to stop the research. The participants at the four-day meeting are involved with health, human rights, international development, and advocacy  organizations in 14 countries.  Antifertility vaccines alter women's  immune systems to create 'anti-bodies'  that prevent fertilized eggs from being  implanted in the wall of the uterus. The  most developed antifertility vaccine to  date can prevent pregnancy for up to two  years. The vaccine, which triggers an  immune reaction against the natural  pregnancy hormone hCG, is being clinically trialed on women in India, Sweden,  and the US. However, the Swedish trials  were stopped because of unanticipated  "side-effects."  Research on antifertility vaccines  began in the 1970s. Internationally, there  are five main research teams developing  immunological contraceptives: the World  Health Organization Special Programme  of Research, Development and Research  TraininginHumanReproduction(WHO  HRP); the National Institute of Immunology in India; and the Population Council,  the National Institute of Child Health  (NICH), and Contraceptive Research and  Development (CONRAD), in the United  States.  Women who participated in the meeting say that anti-fertility vaccines interfere with delicate and complex immunological and reproductive processes, and  therefore can never be safe. Their most  serious concerns with the contraceptive  methods are with their health risks, abuse  potential, unproven efficacy, and irreversibility. [See article on page 16 for an  examination of the problems with immunological contraceptives.]  Carla Marcelis of Women's Health  Interaction says that safety for women is  one of the greatest concerns with the  research and testing of immuno-contra-  ceptive devices. "Interference with the  immune system for contraceptive purposes is indefensible at a time when primary health care systems are being dismantled, when the incidence of many  infectious diseases are increasing, and  when we have become acutely aware of  the complexity of the immune system  and the effects on the health of an individual when the immune system is com  promised," says Marcelis. The long-  term side effects of the vaccines are still  unknown, but it is feared they could  cause long-term sterility in women.  Nkoyo Toyo of the Society for  Women and Aids in Africa adds that "a  woman cannot stop using the method  when she wishes; she must wait for the  effects to wear off." As well, Toyo raised  concerns that the vaccines offer no protection against sexually transmitted diseases.  Shree Mulay, an associate professor of medicine and physiology at  McGill University and a member of  Graphic ItcmLinking Up For Action by Ji  ceptive methods—a directionaway from  agendas of population control advocates.  "We came here to resist further development of contraceptives that are designed for population control, instead of  for people." says Stemerding.  One strategy of the Campaign is  drrectedtowardschallengingthe funders  of anti-fertility vaccine projects. Research  into immunological contraceptives is  being backed by money from the World  Bank, the United National Population  Fund, the UN Development Programme,  the Rockefeller Foundation, the US  Agency for International Development,  Calling the contraceptives being developed  'vaccines' is very disturbing because it  shows that researchers are treating  pregnancy as a disease,  rather than a natural body process.  NAC's Committee on New Reproductive Technologies, says that calling the  contraceptives being developed  'vaccines' is very disturbing because it  shows thatresearchers are treatingpreg-  nancy as a disease, rather than a natural  body process. "We are concerned that  this contraceptive method calls itself a  'vaccine,' when traditionally vaccines  are used to prevent real diseases, such  as diphtheria and tuberculosis," says  Mulay.  The women participating in the  meeting say that research must be  focussed on contraceptive methods that  are safe and that give women control  over their reproductive functions.  "Women want means to regulate our  fertility, but we want means that do not  compromise our health, our integrity  and our well being," says Beatrijs  Stemerding of the Women's Global  Network for Reproductive Rights  (WGNRR) in the Netherlands. WGNRR  has been coordinating the Campaign to  Stop Research on Antifertility Vaccines.  Stemerding also stresses that to  achieve thiswould require a total change  in the direction of research into contra-  the International Research and Development Centre in Canada (IDRC), and  the governments in India, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Germany.  Women took the opportunity of being in Ottawa to meet with IDRC officials and to hold the IDRC accountable  for their support of antifertility vaccines.  The IDRC has provided $43 million  towards research conducted by the National Institute of Immunology (Nil) in  India, which is currently conducting  clinical trials on women. There have  been serious concerns about the ethics of  the research methods and practices of  the NIL  Before the meeting, the IDRC had  issued a position statement on contraceptive vaccine research, in which they  say that population concerns are not the  driving force behind their research, but  rather it is the improvement of the health  and well being of children. The women  who met with IDRC officials took them  to task pointing out that the Nil research  team has clearly stated that their motives are to stop population growth in  India.  The women demanded that the IDRC  stop funding any research  on anti-fertility vaccines,  and re-direct and re-orient their contraceptive research towards methods  that enable people, and  particularly women, to  exert greater control over  their fertility without sacrificing their integrity,  health and well being.  They also demanded  that, given the IDRC is funding the research in India, it ensure that women  who have participated in the trials be  monitored for adverse affects from the  vaccine. Women participating in the trials were told that the methods were 100  percent safe, even though the purpose of  trials is to determine whether or not that  is true. Kalpana Mehta, a participant  from India, says that Saheli, a women's  resource centre in Delhi, would volunteer to do follow-up work with these  women.  Overall, women feel they were successful in giving the IDRC a warning  that women will not stand for this kind  of attack on our bodies and reproductive processes. "The meeting with IDRC  was an important step towards involving potential users of contraceptives in  decisions about what kind of methods  will be developed," says Karen  Seabrooke of Inter Pares.

JULY/AUGUST 1995 Women and new reproductive technologies:  ^   Taking  In early June, women activists from 14 countries gathered in Ottawa to strategize around stopping research on anti-  fertility vaccines [see story, page 13]. On the final day of the meetings, the Canadian organizers—Women's Health Interaction,  Inter Pares and the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC)—co-hosted a public forum. The forum was  held to inform people about oppressive contraceptive devices and methods, about how they are being used in the North  and in the South, and to mobilize support to stop the research development and use of these technologies.  The public forum was co-chaired by NAC president Sunera Thobani and Beatrijs Stemerding of the Women's Global  Network for Reproductive Rights in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Four women spoke at the forum—Kalpana Mehta, Luiza  Bairros, Shree Mulay and Eileen O'Brien—to address different methods of contraception within the context of population  control policies. Below, Kinesis presents excerpts from their speeches.  "Racism and population control are dimensions  strongly and deeply inter-connected."  by Luiza Bairros  Luiza Bairros. Photo by Carla Marcelis.  Luiza Bairros is from Brazil and is involved with the Unified Black Movement  (Movimento Negro Unificado).  I think we are livingin times markedby the ideaof crisis—a crisis as a result of something  I call "an industry that creates fear and lack of confidence." That industry has attempted to  make us believe the world is not viable because of a general lack of resources.  The feeling of chaos we sometimes experience is not due to the fact we live in a world  that is growing worse. The uneasiness that some of us feel comes out of a deeper awareness  of the contradictions increasing in the qualities that mark the relationships between  countries, between men and women, between people from different races, from different  ethnic groups.  The uneasiness  also comes out of the  fact that we cannot take  for granted anymore  old patterns of relationships in which, for example non-white people—and particularly  people of African descent—are forced to  accept subordination as  given, as something  that can never be  changed.  Our uneasiness  comes from the fact that  we are not, as women for example, confined to a situation of inferiority determined by  patriarchal ways of seeing the world and organizing societies. When I say that, I'm not  underestimating that fact that we still have, in different parts of the world, harsh realities  where authoritarians have an absolute disrespect for people's rights. I just want to stress that  it is inside this contradictory picture that our presence here at this moment has to be  understood.  On one hand, we have widespread actions that attempt to account for the crisis through  population control. On the other hand, we know those same actions can no longer be carried  out without facing the strong response of organized groups, especially women's groups,  which have challenged population control paradigms from the scientific, political, and socioeconomic points of view.  One of the fundamental aspects stressed during this meeting this past weekend, is that  the manipulation of contraceptive methods in the interests of population controllers is being  articulated internationally. The way population control manipulates the issue of contraception has absolutely nothing to do with the demands of men and women, who want to keep  control not only of their reproductive functions, but also of their own lives.  I would like also to stress that the presence of Black women has brought a new approach  to the movement against population control all over the world. To us Black women, putting  an end to the abuse necessarily associated with population control is a fundamental part of  our struggle against racism. And accordingly, it's a fundamental pan of any type of struggle  against perspectives based on the idea that some groups are undesirable and can simply be  disregarded.  I think the relationship between racism and population control can be understood within  . a broader framework that attempts to dehumanize people. And in the specific case of B lack  people, this process of dehumanization happens through a very complex and interconnected  web of racist mechanisms associated with attempts to crush our Blackness.  What I'm saying here is not just one more political statement. In a certain way, this is .  a reflection that comes out of my own experience with the Black movement in Brazil, and  the lessons we learned in trying to stop abusive sterilization that has been going on since the  early 80s.  Part of my reflections also come out of the experience of the feministmovement in Brazil  in trying to stop abusive trials with Norplant. [The trials] were carried out on women from  the poorest regions of the country which, not coincidentally, are also the regions where the  Black population is a majority.  My reflections also come from the opportunities that Black organizations in Brazil [have  had to] network internationally. And as far as we were able [to learn about] the experience  of women in other countries, we can now, very comfortably, reinforce our belief that racism  and population control are dimensions strongly and deeply interconnected.  "Women need to set up defences against the  abuses of yet another 'solution'."  by Eileen  O'Brien  Eileen O'Brien is the president of DAWN Canada (the DisAbled Women's Network).  We need to take responsibility in Canada for our racism, for the way in which we support  quietly and overtly population policies that are enacted throughout the world. Our style of  life is based on some idea that there are kinds of people who should survive and others who  shouldn't.  I'm not only speaking of the reality of how these new contraceptive technologies are  being developed and used in a most heinous and criminal manner to control the fertility of  women without their consent, and in some cases, without their knowledge. For people with  disabilities, existing and reproducing in this society—a society that sees us as unfortunate  burdens—has necessitated a struggle for our liberation as women, [astruggle] we experience  daily as a matter of survival.  To understand that people with disabilities are devalued you must ask 'by whom and for  what purpose.' I can assure you that whatever difficulties we experience directly, related to  our disablity, is outweighed by the difficulties we experience because of the lack of  accommodation and the discrimination within our society. What is wrong with a society that  creates the illusion of scarcity [to promote the] economic agenda of a few, which then defines  how the majority of us live.  We know that women around the world are being given unsafe drugs to control their  fertility, and this is directly related to their perceived value in a sexist, racist, and ableist  patriarchal hierarchy. Within this competitive distorted reality, we as women need to set up  defenses against the  abuses of yet another  'solution,' thatis in fact  costing more lives.  DAWN Canada  has already been fighting the use of Depo  Proverato controlmen-  struation and fertility  in disabled women and  women with disabilities who live in institutions. We are appalled  that Norplant is being  promoted by the pharmaceutical distributors  as a wonder (bug option, with no research  at all into the effects these drugs may have on women with disabilities.  We know we must fight against the forced sterilization of disabled women by any  method, and that we must fight against the forced sterilization of women in other countries  and the testing of immunological vaccines. We must join with other women to call for a halt  to the testing of this dangerous vaccine and work to prevent the abuses on women by these  new technologies.  We must recognize the racist and ableist attitudes that guide our governments, and [look  at] our own support of policies that have led to yearsofmedicalandotherabusesof Aboriginal  peoples and people with disabilities. Within the disability movement, we see disability as a  social construct. We do not think of ourselves as disabled. With accommodation and society's  recognition of diversity, we are abled.  In that context, we can then understand that to be a woman in this world is to be a citizen  living with a disability. This is what fighting ableism is all about; this is what fighting  eugenics and new reproductive technologies and forced sterilization and the medical abuse  of women and girls for profit is all about. It's about each person feeling and knowing the  beauty and strength of his or her own potential; and living with integrity, standing firm and  fighting in the face of their own fears, in the face of the disrespectful and outrageous actions  of the person beside them, and in the face of the actions of the state—nationally,  internationally—that work against our integrity and that of others.

"India's a country where almost every possible  reproductive technology has been used."  by Kalpana Mehta   Kalpana Mehta lives in New Dehli, India and works with Saheli, a women's resource  centre.  The whole ideology of population control has been an imposition on our countries from  the First World. I think a lot of us live in some kind of abelief or understanding that countries  like India are terribly overpopulated and therefore people are poor. And probably some of us  give support to population control.  I'd tike to begin by saying that actually, India can be called underpopulated. That may  surprise some of you—we're close to a billion people. But the Food and Agricultural  Organization of the United Nations did a study.  How many people can India feed comfortably?  1.7 billion. And, in terms of agriculture? As  many as 2.3 billion.  Even today, we grow enough food to feed all  our people and yet, more than half of them go to  bed hungry every night. Obviously, it's not a  problem of numbers. It is a problem of distribution.  India has this great distinction of having  been the first country to start an official family  planning program. This program was started  notas an initiative of the Indian government, but  of agencies like the Indian Planned Parenthood  Foundation, and the [US-based] Ford and  Rockefeller Foundations.  At that time, it was not at all clear to our  government that a growing population was bad  for the country. Every human being is bom with  just one mouth and two hands, so the government could not decide whether for development,  it would take more hands or less mouths to feed.  And this situation lasted for ten years. Even  though we had a family planning program, it  was not really a program of population control.  This program was supported by the Dehli women's movement It was a program where  contraceptives were made available to women. Around the 60s—when India faced its first  post-independence economic crisis—we took US aid, and that aid came with certain  conditions concerning population.  At the beginning of our [three year plan] period in 1960, we had a mixed economy and  ahuge public sector in manufacturing, mining, and services. When the third plan was started  in 1962, the government suddenly said we were overpopulated. There was not actually a  sudden increase in population, but rather a recognition that we were unable to all share in  the fruits of development. It's not that the country wasn' t developing, but with all the people,  we had unemployment, hunger, and we've had some who've grown rich.  This situation kept getting worse until 1975, when we had a political emergency  imposed, and then population control; that's when a really fascist voice came into full play.  From 1975 to 1977, there was a massive sterilization drive in which young boys of 16 to old  men of 70 were rounded up and sterilized. There were'vasectomies done in very [dirty] camps;  there were a large number of deaths. But these were men being targetted—not women—so  they had a political voice, and they managed to overthrow the government.  This made it clear that the population control agencies could not rely on methods which  were meant for men, and since then, systematically, it's women's bodies which have borne  the brunt of these population control programs.  India's a country where almost every possible reproductive technology has been used.  We've had sterilization. Abortion, which has been a matter of great contention in many  countries, was imposed as a population control measure in India without there being any  demand. We had legalized abortion because it also reduces the birth rate.  We've had two injectables—Norplant and Depo Provera. We are well on the way to  accepting RU-486 [a pill that induces abortion]. We have all kinds of IUDs (intra-uterine  contraceptive devices). And of course, we have the dubious distinction of being the furthest  ahead in research on anti-fertility vaccines.  Contraceptive technology has been one of the means through which the vulnerablity of  women is [exploited to achieve] reduction in the birth rate of the country. And now, we're  heading for a population policy where democratic rights of men and women are going to be  curtailed. If you have more than two children, you can* t contest elections, you can't get jobs.  Women who have a third child, will not get maternity leave. This is the way population  control is going to be carried out.  And it's not that women in India have kept quiet We' ve had a very versatile opposition  to these technologies. We' ve had opposition to the curtailment of democratic rights. But this  is one battle where the whole notion of what overpopulation is [needs to be challenged].  Unless it is attacked we cannot get very far, because the game is to coercively control how  people reproduce.  Shree Mulay.  Photo by Fatima Jaffer.  "Long-acting contraceptives are permanent  methods of sterilization."  by Shree Mulay   Shree Mulay is an associate professor of medicine and physiology at McGill University  and a board member of the South Asian Women's Community Centre in Montreal. Mulay  is also a member of NAC's Committee on New Reproductive Technologies.  I have been asked to speak on the different kinds of technologies which either have been  researched, are being clinically trialed, or are being developed for future use. Basically, there  are two long-acting steroidal contraceptives which are actually on the market—Depo Provera  and Norplant.  Depo Provera in fact has not been approved in Canada, despite the fact that [its  manufacturer] has applied for approval three times. Even though it has not been approved,  it is still being used by healthcare professionals, particularly in the north on Aboriginal  women.  Healthcare professionals say Depo Provera  is very effective in preventing pregnancy; that it  has a failure rate of less that one percent; and that  it allows women to contracept secretly without  the knowledge of their family. But the fact is that  there are really a number of side effects associated with Depo Provera, such as irregular bleeding patterns. Most healthcare professionals absolutely dismiss these kinds of side effects because they're experienced by women and so are  not given as much credence.  There is also new data suggesting that  young women are more prone to breast cancer  when they're on Depo Provera. And the fact that  Depo Provera used at a young age depletes your  bone mass, [means that] when you get older you  may have to take other hormones to prevent bone  loss and osteoporosis. I think it's important to  note that migraines, dizziness, all of these side  effects are really minimized by people in the  medical field.  Norplant was approved in Canada in 1993,  and it is beginning to be used be different clinics. Norplant is an implant of six elastic tubes  that can last up to five years. There are a number of problems associated with it The problems  that have surfaced in the the US—where about a million women now have used it—have been  ignored. In all the early trials, it was said that women had no problems with the insertion and  removal of Norplant but these have in fact emerged as major problems.  All the side effects of Depo Provera are also true of Norplant. And neither Depo Provera  nor Norplant have been evaluated for their risks to infants bom of mothers who have used  or are using Norplant and who are breast feeding their babies. The long term effects are not  clear at all.  Research into immuno-vaccines has received $4.5 million dollars over the past 20 years.  One particular vaccine was developed in India at the National Institute of Immunology. All  the clinical trials conducted to date have been very problematic. They have been conducted  in a completely unethical manner and the animal study data are incomplete and superficial.  There are a number of vaccines being developed by many other agencies, such as the  World Health Organization. One vaccine being developed produces anti-bodies towards  sperm or embryo. The wide range of immuno-vaccines all have one common feature—they  interfere with the body's normal immune process.  I think the concern we have is that these vaccines have tremendous potential for abuse  because it can be given to women without their knowledge. There are known instances where  that has happened in the Philippines and in Mexico.  One other agent which has been used but cannot strictly be called a contraceptive—it  is actually a chemical sterilization method—is the Quinacrine method. Quinacrine is a drug  extremely useful in controlling malaria. One particular group of researchers in the 70s began  to introduce Quinacrine into the uterus of women to try to close their fallopian tubes by  causing an inflamatory response.  In the 70s, this particular agent was used on 31,000 women in Vietnam, but worldwide  now, there are about 80,000 women who have been subjected to this particular method of  sterilization. I can assure you that if you go through the literature dealing with Quinacrine,  you'll actually find a story of honors.  I think it's very clear that these kinds of long-acting contraceptives are permanent  methods of sterilization, and they are really most inappropriate. Women do want contraceptives, but they want contraceptives that meet their needs, and not something meant to meet  other people's agendas.  Clearly, all the contraceptive methods that have been developed are inappropriate for  women. Safe contraceptives, which are in women's control, which protect them from  sexually transmitted diseases are the key, and therefore we must demand a re-orientation of  the contraceptive research being done at this time. Feature   The problems with immunological contraceptives:  Risks not worth taking  Most women probably believe (and hope) that vaccines which attack certain hormones in our bodies to prevent  pregnancy could only be found in late-night TV sci-fi movies, but in fact such anti-fertility vaccines are already being  tested in many women's bodies.  Over 30 women from around the world gathered this past June in Ottawa to strategizefurther to halt research and  testing of immunological contraceptive methods [see story, page 13], but it is likely that most of us have never even  heard of them, let alone the risks they pose to our health, integrity and well being.  The fact that population control proponents in countries in both the South and the North are funding and  promoting these vaccines,should make it so very clear to women that they're extremely harmful to our lives. WKBmmm  The following article lays out the problems associated with the research and testing of immunological contraceptives and with the methods themselves. It is excerpted from "Immunological Contraceptives: designed for populations  not people," an article produced by Health Action International-Europe and the Women's Health Action Foundation  in the Netherlands in May 1994.  Immunological contraceptives, or  'anti-fertility vaccines,' are a new type of  birth control currently under development. Several different types are being  developed, some of which target hormones, others part of the egg, sperm or  early embryo.  The most advanced research is on  methods which attack the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)  produced by the fertilized egg just after  conception. [The anti-fertility vaccines]  are formed by combining part of the  hormone hCG with parts of substances  produced by a germ, usually tetanus or  diphtheria toxoids. When the body defends itself against this combined molecule, it also attacks the hormone hCG.  If the attack is successful, pregnancy is  prevented.  The aim of this research is to develop a method which is a single injection and prevents pregnancy for one to  two years. Research on these methods  began in the 1970s, and a method maybe  ready for marketing in as little as five  years.  Vaccination against disease works  by stimulating a person's body to defend itself against a specific type of germ.  The vaccine strengthens thenormalproc-  ess of immune defense against disease.  Pregnancy, however, is not a disease but  a natural body process. Immunological  contraceptives cause the immune system to attack a body function which  would otherwise be protected. They  mimic the process which occurs with  immunological infertility or other  autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.  Risks of birth defects?  No way to know.  Animal studies are used to test the  safety of new products. One other concern about trials of immunological contraceptives is that evidence from animal  studies isnotsufficienttoestablishsafety.  For example there have been no studies  in baboons which could show whether  the method developed by the World  HealthOrganization Special Programme  of Research, Developmentand Research  TraininginHumanReproduction(WHO  HRP) could cause birth defects.  It is hard to directly apply the results  of animal research to humans because  immunological contraceptives target a  human body substance. However, data  on safety is crucial because these methods are so experimental and are meant  for use by healthy women.  Temporary irreversible  There is no way to stop the immune  response provoked by these contraceptives until it wears off on its own. If a  woman develops side effects, becomes  pregnant accidentally, or decides to get  pregnant, there is little she can do. No  one knows what the risks for the child  will be if a woman becomes pregnant  accidentally while using an immunological method or is already pregnant  without knowing it when she has the  injection.  Unpredictable effectiveness  These contraceptives depend on  immune response, which varies from  woman to woman. Users willnotbe able  to know in advance exactly how long  their birth control method will last or  how well it will work. Some women  might have a weak immune response,  others an unusually strong response. A  woman's immune response is affected  by factors such as genetics, nutrition,  infections, chronic disease, stress and  fatigue. Different women have reacted  differently in all of the trials.  The overall effectiveness of immunological contraceptives appears to be  very poor compared to existing contra  ceptives. In the phase 2 trials  [in India], 40 percent of participants were not included  in the calculation of the results because of an inadequate immune response;20  percent never reached the  level set by the researchers;  and another 20 percent  reached it for less than three  months. The World Health  Organization (WHO) phase  1 trials showed at most a  promise of a six month contraceptive period after two  injections, at the highest of  five dose levels tested.  There isnoargumentfor  developing and marketing a  contraceptive unless it offers an improvementof some  sort over existing alterna-  wBrnmsmm tives. Thus far, the contraceptive reliability of immunological contraceptives is much lower  than that of hormonal contraceptives,  IUDs,condoms, diaphragms, or fertility  awareness methods.  Risks of harmful effects  Autoimmune disorders occur more  often in women than men. Immunological contraceptives could lead to  autoimmune disorders or worsening of  existing autoimmune disease. The result of the first WHO clinical trials and  some animal studies are worrying as  they show some immune reactions to  cells in the pancreas. These reactions are  a sign that the contraceptive may be  causing autoimmune attacks against  other body organs.  Unsuitable for the  1990s AIDS pandemic  A1989 WHO symposium on immunological contraceptives recommended  that they should not be among the preferred options for birth control in  populations with a high prevalence of  HIV infection as there are concerns about  safety and efficacy in immuno-compro-  mised individuals [those with weakened  immune systems].  Immunological contraceptives will  provide no protection against any sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including the HIV virus.  A design which makes abuse likely  Researchersareaimingforamethod  administered by a single injection which  will be effective for up to two years. It  will not be reversible during this time. If  they reach this goal, immunological  methods may be easily provided without a woman's informed consent. "My  main fear is that the vaccine will be  forced on people who lack information,"  says Gladys Siwela of Isis-Women's International Cross Cultural Exchange in  Uganda.  The implantable contraceptive  Norplant provides a vivid illustration of  the possibilities for abuse. Studies in  several countries have found that "removal on demand did not occur to the  satisfaction of the user." In the USA,  judges have sentenced womenconvicted  of child abuse to Norplant. Immunological contraceptives would be even  easier to provide without consent than  Norplant as no surgery is needed.  Women have had trouble getting  Norplant taken out when they no longer  want to use it; with immunological contraceptives, they willl havenochoicebut  to continue to use the method until the  effects wear off.  What these methods mean for users?  Based on current knowledge, immunological contraceptives will bring:  • unreliable   protection   against  pregnancy;  • irreversibility during an unpredictable  period of effectiveness;  • risks of autoimmune disease and other  immunological adverse effects;  • unknown risks for children exposed  before birth;  • possible interactions with malnutrition  and disease;  • no protection against STDs, including  AIDS; and  • a high potential for abuse.

JULY/AUGUST 1995 Commentary  Backlash against the First Nations:  Never ending robbery  by Fay Blaney  In recent times, many disadvantaged groups have been able to  put the almighty white middle-classed man in check with the  strength and the correctness of our politics. As a Homalco First  Nation woman, this has meant that it is easier for me to say when  was experiencing racism, classism and sexism.  But with the backlash of the reactionary  right-wing, we have witnessed a move back to Desnite th© f RCt  the way things used to be.

For colonization and control of the land and 9  resources to be successful, the Europeans had to  destroy the many nations which occupied lands on the continents. The removal of  our children from their families was one of the main strategies employed by the  British colonizers.  Residential schools were created throughout North America, as well as on other  continents. The first residential school in BC opened in 1861 and continued to  operate until 1986. The violence, atrocities and torture committed by Arthur Plint  brings to light the experiences that Aboriginal  ......    _.. children had in the residential schools.

While some Christians and academics have gone to great pains to highlight the benevolent intentions and benefits of these institutions, efforts of such First Nations as the Caribou  Tribal Council have provided quite a different  picture.  In her book, Victims of Benevolence: Discipline  and Death at the Williams Lake Indian Residential  School: 1891 -1920, Elizabeth Furniss describes starvation, corporal punishment and forced labour  aQainSt US iS On        mat children endured. With the many attempts to  , run away, Furniss says that one boy in her study  the inCreaSe. and likely several others died while trying to  escape. She also says that a suicide pact between  nine boys was the result of excessive beatings.  Conditions were such that some children chose death rather than existence under  that system. What better way to gain control over an entire population than through  our children.  The internment of First Nations children into residential schools overlapped  with the kidnapping practices of the provincial child welfare authorities in Canada.  Aboriginal children were taken in drastically large number in the 1960s, a time  which became known as "the sixties scoop". Again, legislation and Department of  Indian Affairs (DIA) policies showed a clear commitment to the cultural genocide  of Aborginal peoples. Although the 1951 amendment to the Indian Act legislated  that provincial programs and services be provided to Native people as well, BC  refused administer these services unless DIA provided financial remuneration to  the province to cover Aboriginal recipients.  In the early 1960s, a federal-provincial agreement was reached in which DIA  agreed to pay BC for each child in the care of the Superintendent of Family and Child  Services. Clearly, it was an impetus for social workers to apprehend and place  Aboriginal children into white foster homes, rather than to implement support  services for our families.  The June 1995 issue of Kinesis reported the story  of Donna and Marie Lewis, two sisters who are  suing the BC Ministry of Social Services and the  RCMP for the years of sexual abuse suffered in one  of these foster homes. [The sisters recently settled  their suit outside of court.] While inadequate information is available on this  horrific legacy of generations of Native children, this experience is  probably quite prevalent throughout the country.  The eugenics movement of the  early 1900s is another poorly documented issue in the Aboriginal colonial experience. Scholars such as  Angus McLaren have studied eugenics practices in Canada, buthave  only looked minimally at the numbers of Aboriginal people who were  sterilized. During the Depression,  bothBC and Alberta passed sexual  sterilization acts, which cleared  the way for the sterilization of  those deemed to be mentally defective. The Board of Eugenics in  each province, made up of members of the ruling class, made the  determination of whether an individual was "feeble-minded"  or not, based upon the clearly  culturally-biased test of the day.  McLaren states that in Alberta,  of all those being sterilized, 25 percent of these were Aboriginal people.  With the influx of people of colour immigrating into this part of the country,  evidence indicates they were also the ones whose populations were being controlled to ensure "social order" and white dominance.  Despite the fact that our textbooks do not provide this kind of information, we,  First Nations women, know that these genocidal policies have been and continue  to be levelled against us. Many women of our families and our communities are  unable to bear children because of forced sterilization. Because we have been denied our right to  bear children, our right to raise our own children,  and our right to maintain our cultural identity, we  have been reluctant supporters of the feminist  struggle for the right to choose birth control or  abortion.  It is ironic that during the so-called "second-  wave feminism" of the sixties, First Nations women  suffered a second phase in the loss of our children.  While state authorities persisted in the conspicuous implementation of its cultural genocidal laws  and policies, ruling class women turned their  backs on us while we were being annihilated.  What is ever so frustrating is the fact that "first",  and "second-wave" feminists spoke using race  and class interests as a focal point, yet still today  they are refusing to acknowledge current day  issues of land claims and self-government.  While First Nations people are becoming much  stronger and more vocal about our poverty, our  experiences as recipients of cultural genocidal  policies and the deliberate tactic designed to keep us in a position of disadvantage,  the backlash against us is on the increase. Hatred of Aboriginal people can be found  in the streets, on the radio and in the papers—a ploy designed to "manufacture [the]  consent" of the Canadian public to extinguish Aboriginal rights and title to the land.  The media continually condemns us for "poaching" fish, and other wildlife, for  scamming the welfare system, for blockading the roads, for demanding constitutional recognition for our title to the land, for demanding admissions for wrongdoing, et cetera, and yet our non-Aboriginal supporters are silent. The silence of our  allies indicates that the gap has not yet been bridged.  While forced birth control and population control are being enforced upon the  so-called Third World as a means of hoarding the wealth and resources, the  Canadian government simply carries on its practice of dispossessing the First  Nations—by robbing us of our ability to resist—through our children.  Fay Blaney is a member of the Homalco First Nation, member of the Indian Homemakers Association, currently pursuing a Master of Arts Degree at Simon Fraser University, and is mother of two.  The internment of  First Nations  children  into residential  schools overlapped with  the kidnapping  practices of the  provincial child  welfare authorities  in Canada.  JULY/AUGUST 1995  -     ' R  Arts  Review of Miscegenation Blues;  Identity, community,  belonging  by Kay  Ray  MISCEGENATION BLUES:  Voices of mixed race women  edited by Carol Camper,  Sister Vision Press, Toronto, 1994  The increasing visibility of racially  mixed people challenges traditionally  held notions about race. The presence of  mixed race people breaks down the hierarchies of race and ideologies of white  supremacy, troubling the whole notion  of who belongs and who doesn't.  Miscegenation Blues: Voices of Mixed  Race Women is a collection of writings by  more than 40' women of mixed racial  heritage. Carol Camper, who edited this  anthology, is a mixed race woman of  Black, white and Native North American ancestry. Camper explains thatMis-  cegenation Blues emerged out of a deeply  felt need of women "to end isolation and  to understand racial multiplicity within  our own bodies, families and cultures."  Camper, is not a stranger to cultural  isolation and loneliness. She was  adopted as an infant, by a white family,  and grew up in London, Ontario. Like  many mixed race women, she looked  differentfromthepeopleshe saw around  her, and consequentiy she began to question her background. What happens to  your psyche and sense of self when your  appearance, culture and community are  not affirmed? Questions about who we  are, who we look like and the longing for  connections and community are some of  the themes explored by the various writers in Miscegenation Blues.  Racism, colonialism, internalized  racism, and family betrayal—these are  some of the experiences that mixed race  women discuss in Miscegenation Blues.  For some of us who are mixed race,  racism was not always learned on the  streets, but learned at home. Home—  that place which is supposed to provide  safety—was the place where we learned  race hatred. These betrayals are deep  and lasting, and are explored poignantly in several pieces, including Nila  Gupta's poem, "Rage is My Sister" and  Lorraine Mention's "Journal Entry:  Thoughts On My 'Mother'," a short reflection on betrayal, misunderstanding  and longing that arises out of the  unexamined racial hatred that can happen in our own families.

Screen Festival, June 1995  How to explain my feelings of exhilaration after viewing this documentary even though it shows evidence of a  rigid, patriarchal tradition and the results of a Confucianism that affect the  lives of generations of women?  Dream Girls is about the Takarazuka  School and Revue Company, which was  started by the owner of the town's railroad — a Mr Kobayashi. His motive for  starting the school was entirely capitalist: to encourage more riders for his  trains.  Entrance to study at this school is  highly competitive and difficult. Girls  come from all over Japan to try to make  their dream of singing and dancing with  the Takarazuka Revue come true. Only  forty are chosen each year from thousands and the selection process is a highly  emotional affair.  So is catching a glimpse of the star—  usually the women who play male roles  on stage. These stars are mobbed by  hundreds of female fans in an adoring,  pop-mania, screaming style every time  they are in public. From schoolgirls to  housewives, emotions of devotion, desire, loyalty and romance come pouring  out of otherwise 'good,' reserved Japanese women. Stars receive thousands of  letters, usually hand-delivered by fans,  and bouquets of flowers that fill rooms.  So what is taught at this school?  From the speeches of the headmaster  and some of the classes, one would assume that this music-dance school only  teaches highly ritualized cleaning methods along with highly defined roles of  gender subjectivity to younger women  by older Japanese men. From the beginning, these girls choose whether to be a  player in male or female roles. These  roles look stereotyped and one dimensional. But in a scene of older students  tutoring the younger students in choreography, including gender role playing,  we see how the students translate these  stereotypes of gender for themselves.  On stage, this results in performance  where the highly defined gender roles  become appropriated for the uses and  fantasies of both actors and audiences,  all women. Some scenes during performances are very sexual.  Even so, it seems the school does  teach its students skills in performance  and creativity. One scene that shows  students learning a very subtle exercise  in painting an imaginary scene and learning how to describe it without telling a  story was so fascinating, I wondered  how such an exercize is used for performance.  mmmM  Above, top star Anju Mira talks about her future  husband, while below, students at Takarazuka sing  the school anthem. Video grabs courtesy WFMM.  In the clouds       §1 I  SC  This documentary is about paradox. On the one hand, the Takarazuka  School is rigid and disciplined. The hierarchies that exist among the students  remind me of the convent I attended in  Southern Africa where mundane tasks  were ritualized to teach discipline. An  example in this film is where the first  year students get down on hands and  knees to pick up lint with gaffer tape.  Along with this hierarchy atTakarazuka  comes a strict indoctrination into the  proper ways to take (or not take) space,  to respect authority and to know your  duties within these spaces—such as  cleaning the gravesite of Mr Kobayashi,  getting lessons in marching and bowing  from the local military unit, or never  leaving the rehearsal room with your  back facing the room.  On the other hand, amid this rigidity and discipline, within their drab,  gray uniforms and obedient conformity,  these young women blossom as soon as  they perform, like exultant butterflies  freed from their tightly controlled cocoons. With majestic costumes and flamboyant feathers and props,all is sensual,  seductive and awesome.  Even though the school's repertoire  is limited to a genre like western theatrical musicals (similar to West Side Story,  or Cats) and sometimes with content  similar to Harlequin-type romances, the  reality is these women can truly sing and  dance. They are beau-  tiful, talented and  know how to ham up  their performances  with the right amount  of fun, pomp and seduction. It is drag-  king at its finest.  The two British  women filmmakers  have carefully woven  scenes of this documentary together.  Withoutexplanations  or outing of  queernesses, they  have created a documentary that is self-  evident, stated by inference, of an undoubtedly queer  subtext at the  Takarazuka School.  Western perspectives  may get upset that the  inference isnotamore  conscious statement  or naming, but that  necessity to explain  and name in the east  can be an insult because that being explained and named is  so obvious. Here, the  obvious is a blatant  and enthusiastic adoration for women by women and a support of a gender bending culture.  Given that the film is a BBC production, it makes me wonder to what degree the filmmakers are outsiders to the  culture portrayed in Dream Girls? What  is revealed then by those being interviewed is limited by the assumptions  and projections of what is deemed  proper and respectable for the west to  see.  As with all documentaries, this one  creates its own fiction by the nature of  what is omitted. By this I mean that  within the limitations of, say, a patriarchal, homophobic environment, you will  only succeed in getting certain types of  statements during interviews—for example: getting married and moving on  in life will be more commonly stated  than, say, wanting to be a drag-king  forever and living happily with your  girlfriend. In the only statement from a  Takarazuka graduate who used to be a  player of male roles and is now a 'mature, married' woman, she describes the  crisis point at age twenty-five for all  performers and her choice to leave the  school to get married.  This begs the question: where are all  the other graduates and why does only  one graduate speak? Maybe she was the  only one who wanted to, or, maybe all  the answers would have been redundant. However, I don't think that, after  this intense schooling in such a cultural  environment, all these hundreds of  women would make the same choice.  A subtle hint of other realities is  made when current star Anju Mira states  confidently: "Is there a man big enough  to marry someone as selfish as me? Is  there? I don't think he exists." Or, when  a housewife joyfully admits her excited  sensations when she first saw Anju Mira  perform, how she steals away fromhome  to see performances and to meet her  friend to talk about Anju Mira along  with other 'womantalk'.  The tradition of gender bending in  Asian culture is old, as shown in Peking  and Cantonese Operas or the mythologies of god-goddesses like Guan-Yin,  who as a male deity transformed him/  herself to become a female deity. Meanwhile, there is a contemporary nightclub  for women in Japan where all the employees and performers are women in  male dress and roles. Many of the clientele go there for an atmosphere of romance, to relax after work, and to not get  harassed. What is revealed then in Dream  Girls isn't really a surprise.  What is a surprise is how this school,  under the strict rule of men, allows and  nurtures these gender bending performances on such a grandiose scale. This is  significant on a symbolic level because it  makes visible complex questions about  the sexuality of women. What is fascinating is how the stars of Dream Girls flip  the construction of gender through their  performances and how the flocks of audiences participate in this sabotage, and  again, on this large scale.  What becomes evident is the understanding among performers and audience of the separateness between the  'real, practical' world these women are  bound and controlled by, and the 'fantasy' world they imagine, create and  live. The Dream Girls culture is about  bringing all these worlds together, letting them exist and flourish within the  real and the imaginary, within the sensual and the rigid, between the east and  the west, within gender constructions.  The paradox is our human ability to  compromise ourselves, to be submissive and herded, and yet, still able to be  challenged by a courageous spirit of  resilience, within creativity and imagination, even under the strictest rule of  patriarchy and capitalism.  In the end, what is exhilarating is  seeing the social construction of women's identity and gender counterpointed  with wonderfully, wild images of  womenbreakingloose,singingand dancing, expressing desire and seduction...  for other women... and all possible within  the narrow definitions of the patriarch.  Laiwan dreams of joining Takarazuka but  is trapped in this current life as a writer /  artist living in Vancouver.  JULY/AUGUST 1995 Arts   Reviewing the viewing of When Night is Falling;  When dykes are stalking  by Sandra McPherson  WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING  directed by Patricia Rozema, 1995  My point of view and critique of  When Night is Falling is twofold. The first  has to do with the reviews and inter-  viewsof the film—how the film has been  socially constructed and the second has  to do with the film itself—how Rozema  constructed her film. I want to raise  some questions about the film I think all  viewers and fans should be asking.  I read four reviews and interviews  of When Night is Falling—in the Georgia  Straight, the Westender, the Vancouver  SunandMaclean'sMagazine—beioresee-  ing the premiere screening in Vancouver. They all pretty much summarize the  film as a love story between a repressed,  Catholic, heterosexual academic and an  avant-garde, bold, lesbian circus performance artist. None of the reviews or  interviews mentioned or asked Rozema  about race.  Rozema deliberately casts a Black  woman to play the role of Petra, the  circus performer who seduces Camille,  the white academic. So why did none of  the reviewers think it important to question or mention the use of race in When  Night is Falling, and why did Rozema  want a Black woman to play the lesbian  seductress role?  I asked white friends about the absence of dealing with the race issue in the  reviews and they all basically said that  race didn't matter. Inter-racial couples,  they said, are not a big deal anymore.  Granted all of my friends partners are  white, but they had friends who are in  inter-racial relationships.  Pressing, I said: OK, but since this  film is art and Rozema deliberately constructed a particular image, are we not  forced to acknowledge that she was trying to convey something specific? One  friend mentioned that she thought thatit  was sort of 'politically incorrect' these  days to mention race. It really doesn't  matter what colour the people are  anymore. My friends all thought that I  was trying to make something out of  nothing.  But I think they're wrong. I even  think that Rozema is kidding herself  when she said in an interview with  MacLean's that "[When Night is Falling is]  a classical romance. I wanted to use all  the old conventions with one key twist."  Rozema too, does not want to deal with  race. She wanted the lesbian relationship to be the "one key twist." For her to  suggest that she can separate race and  sexual orientation in Petra—the Black  lesbian in the "lesbian" relationshi—is  indeed an old convention and a fantasy.  The reviewer inMaclean's wrote that  "When Night is Falling represents a kind  of coming out. She [Rozema] had wanted  to make a lesbian romance for some  time, she says, 'but earlier in my career,  I didn't want to be known as the lesbian  filmmaker'." Even now, she remains wary  of being typecast. 'With this film, I'm  introducing the subject of sexual preference, but I'm still uneasy about discussing mine publicly. I guess I would have  called myself bi six or seven years ago. I  don't know'."  In the same article, Rozema adds  that "since this subject isn't completely  palatable, I wanted to make eveiything  around it warm and easy to digest, as  sensual as can be, admit in every frame  that it's about pleasure." Who, we might  ask, would find this subject not completely palatable, but still find sensual  pleasure in every frame? Patricia  Rozema! WhenNightisFallingisherovm  "lesbian" fantasy. Only a wannabe ("but  I can't make up my mind") would portray lesbianism as something that happens to a het when she is being stalked  by a dyke.  It is important to read Rozema's  words and see her film to understand  how deeply racial stereotypes are ingrained, accepted and not so innocently  perpetuated in thisculture. Rozema sees  only one twist in her film—a iove' relationship between two women.  It is clear that Rozema wanted her  viewers to sit back and live the fantasy of  being seduced by a lesbian. She made  the lesbian Black so that she could use  the old convention of using the Black  woman as existing strictly to gratify the  desires of whites. Rozema defined Petra  as a Black lesbian so that she would not  have to create a context or content for the  character—she isn't real. So why does  she not use a white lesbian? Petra could  not have been white because the beautiful white women who travel with the  circus are acrobats, or the wives, lovers  and assistants to the magician or ringmaster—these women are real.  Rozema constructed Petra as some  sort of sexually promiscuous nurse/  maid protector, who has some psychic  ability to know that if she stalked Camille  long enough, Camille would finally admit that she always wanted to be a lesbian and run away with the circus. Petra  is predictable but coy as she starts rubbing Camille's leg, thigh, back, crawls  up on the bed, lifts her shirt, and undoes  her bra. The audience I saw it with saw  that scene coming and they loved it.  Theywerernaldngnoise,interactingwith  the film, gettin' into it.  Maybe I don't know what it's like to  be starved for such an intimate scene  between lesbian lovers on the big screen.  That must be what the fans of the film  around the world are celebrating, because the depiction of the Black woman  in this film is stereotypical and racist,  and that's nothing to celebrate or encourage.  OK, you might be saying that it's  only a movie. Yes, it is only a movie but  think about what I've written. Look at  the kind of exploitation you are consuming as entertainment. It isn't by accident  or coincidence that Petra is Black. Nor is  it mere oversight that reviewers and  interviewers do not mention race. The  depiction of Black women as the transient, without family, freakish, exotic  other is, sadly, so expected and accepted  in this culture that few have deemed it  necessary to discuss.

Allow  me to wish I had been a lesbian leftist  feminist artist then, in Vancouver, in  what must have been heady times. In  the 90s, the city is awash in 20th anniversaries—celebrations of institutions  of national and international importance begun by various scruffy groups  of idealists: Kinesis (1974), Vancouver  Status of Women (1971), Vancouver  Co-operative Radio (1975), Video In  (1973), Western Front (1974)...  And of course Press Gang Printers  and Publishers (1970 and 1975).  Kinesis readers will remember the  demise of Press Gang Printers in 1993,  [see Kinesis, October 1993] after 23 years  as a worker-controlled print shop, and  the last feminist worker-controlled print  shop in North America.  Yet Press Gang lives on, as Press  GangPublishers,aconsistentlyrisk-tak-  ing collective, with an expanding list of  diverse feminist writing. My personal  involvement with Press Gang as an author (and sometime office help) is recent, butanhonourablehistory stretches  twenty years. From humble beginnings  as a volunteer sub-group of the printers,  Press Gang Publishers has gone on to  carry 44 current titles, spanning fiction,  non-fiction, and poetry. Two Press Gang  poets are award winners (Joanne Arnott  and Chrystos). Karlene Faith's Unruly  Women won the 1994 VancityBookPrize,  and Kiss & Tell's Her Tongue on my  Theory this year became the first Canadian title to win a Lambda [see What's  News, page 9] literary award.  Impressive. Not to mention the intangibles—the commitment to putting  out voices we rarely get to hear: of Native women, Black women, Asian  women, ritual abuse survivors, lesbians... With such authors as Chrystos,  Lee Maracle, Beth Brant, Anne Cameron,  Ann Decter, Makeda Silvera, Betsy  Warland, Marusya Bociurkiw and SKY  Lee, to name a few. Most Press Gang  authors defy categorization, straddling  cultures, genres, and styles.  OK OK OK. But how did they get  from here to there? How did it start?  Press Gang Printers began in 1970,  and became an all women's collective in  1974. A year later, in 1975, they decided  to support local women writers by publishing books initiated by the collective.  "Pat Smith was the force behind the  publishing," says long-time Press Gang  worker Sarah Davidson. "There were  lots of other women involved, but she  had the vision."  Pat was a Press GangPrinterscollec-  tive member who "got tired of printing  all the time," says Penny Goldsmith,  who helped with distribution in the publishers'early days. Davidson recalls that  many Vancouver writers were self-publishing, using PressGangas their printer,  but not getting very good distribution.  The first book that finally came out  under the Press Gang Publishers' imprint was Women Look at Psychiatry, edited by Dorothy Smith and Sara David.  In the early years as a publisher, the  books came out irregularly—as time and  money permitted, and as local feminist  women came forward with manuscripts.  Still, Pat Smith said, "If feminist publishing aims to uncover and transform the  symbols mat shape women's lives, then  Press Gang is proficient, if not prolific."  (Pat Smith was killed in a motorcycle  accident in 1985.)  In 1982, the publishing collective  began to operate separately within Press  Gang, making its own decisions and  managing its own finances, though the  two collectives—printers and publishers—continued to share ideals and work  space. The formal separation was necessary because of the different needs and.  timelines in printing and publishing—  the immediacy of the work schedule for  a printing job, as opposed to the longer  process of editing, producing, and selling a book.  For several years, the work of the  publishers was divided between a small  (one, then two women) staff and a volunteer collective. As the business grew,  this gradually became untenable, largely  due to the high rate of volunteer turnover. In 1987, the decision was made to  dissolve the volunteer component. The  staff committed themselves to increasing the number of books published per  year, and to working more as a business.  In 1988, Press Gang books stopped  being printed "in house"—that is, Press  Gang Printers no longer exclusively  printed the books. This was a decision of  financial necessity on the part of both the  printers and publishers. In 1989, the  publishing collective became registered  as Press Gang Publishers Feminist Cooperative. And at the end of 1993, when  Press Gang Printers closed its doors, the  publishers moved out of the old press  building on Powell Street to their own  offices at 17th and Main.  Barbara Kuhne is the present Managing Editor. Asked why Press Gang  continues at a time when small presses  of all kinds are in trouble across Canada,  she says "Yes, things have changed, and  there are some opportunities out there  with larger publishers. Some larger  presses are developing lesbian lines of  books, for example. But particularly  some of the more radical books we've  done might have had trouble finding  Women Look at Psychiatry edited by Dorothy E. Smith and Sara J.  David, the first book published by Press Gang in 1975, and Breasting  the Waves by Joanne Arnott, forthcoming this fall, celebrate 20 years  of feminist publishing at Press Gang.  another publisher, small or large. At  Press Gang we consider things like 'this  is a real first, nothing like this has been  done'."  Press Gang's genesis and survival is  firmly planted in the we-can-do-it miraculous (there's no other word for it)  women-in-print movement. Feminist  publishing as we know it began in the  early 70s as a stack of stapled pamphlets  on literature tables at women's liberation events. Though the feminist print  shops are gone now, they were an integral part of a network of printers, bookstores, and publishers that has defied  financial and logistical obstacles to get  feminist news and ideas out there when  no one else would.  And sisterhood is not dead—feminist publishers help each other. For example, the Women's Press in Toronto  and Press Gang had a co-distribution  agreement for many years which expanded to include the first books out of  Toronto-based Sister Vision: Black  Women and Women of Colour Press.  Press Gang author Joanne Arnott  points out that feminist publishers are  essential for her to reach her audience.  "My work very rarely appears in any  kind of mainstream magazine. My audience reads feminist publications." She  says Press Gang has offered her invaluable encouragement and support in developing manuscripts.  PressGang'smission statement says  they are "committed to publishing a  wide range of writing by women which  explores themes of personal and political struggles for equality." They  prioritize Canadian women writers, and  aim for an international market. In one  document they say, "Publishing  writing[s] by women who have had no  previous publications, and producing  books that are considered too 'risky' by  mainstream publishers is an assumed  part of our editorial policy. Clearly that  is not all we aim to publish...[We] hesitate to say who our press speaks for:  ultimately each book can only speak for  itself. Each author is one voice, not a  spokesperson for any community for  women."  The chorus of these voices has become an invaluable addition to small  press publishing and a transformative  force for the legions of women reached  by Press Gang books. For feminist writers, the press represents an opportunity  to speak out without compromise.  Barbara Kuhne says, "I feel like I  have a responsibility to our authors, and  to the larger community that supports  and reads our books. Authors are taking  a lot of risks, both personally and p rofes-  sionally, as writers, and as artists. The  larger community needs that diversity,  needs the more radical books, need the  broad range."  Press Gang will celebrate their 20th  anniversary with a gala event in November.  In 1975 Emma Kivisild was in high school  in Calgary, Alberta, listening to  Supertramp and watching Monty Python.

Something Like a  War is the powerful and disturbing documentary by Indian filmmaker Deepa  Dhanraj which looks at coercive sterilization programs in India aimed at poor  women. It screened across Canada in  1992 at various alternative and progressive spaces, and has since become an  essential resource for people interested  in learning more about the global impact  of new reproductive technologies  (NRTs).  In Legacy of Malthus, Dhanraj joins  forces with Vancouver-based filmmaker  Mary Daniel to create a documentary  tackling the broader historical and global context of the politics of poverty and  population control.  As the title suggests, The Legacy of  Malthus critically examines the historical origins and continued legacy of the  argument that overpopulation is the  primary cause of poverty—an argument  first put forward by Thomas Malthus, a  political economist writing at the turn of  the 18th century. By blaming the 'excessive'breeding of the poor and the'unfit'  for the economic and social tensions  emerging in the newly industrialized  Britain of the 1700s, his theories offered  a convenient moral justification to those  whose interests lay in preserving their  privileged positions in the rapidly widening gap between rich and poor.  Nearly 100 years later, the vested  interests in supporting this theory remain much the same But one of the  difference is that today, western and  "third world" elites use the alleged  population explosion to explain not  only hunger and poverty, but unemployment and envoronmental degradation as well.  The two main 'story lines' threading through The Legacy of Malthus explore alternative explanations of poverty, destitution and environmental destruction —probles that have been and  continue to be ascribed to overpopulation.  The first story, told through archival photographs and dramatic  reenactment, documents the ordeals of  an early 19th century peasant community in the Scottish Highlands. The peasants were evicted from their homes  and land and replaced by (more profitable) sheep.  The second story, told through the  compelling accounts of rural women in  Rajasthan, India, is the present-day tale"  of women attempting to resist the commercial exploitation of common lands  and subsistence resource-based  economy.  As the stories unfold, we learn of the  tragedies and ordeals caused by the appropriation of common land and the  environmental degradation created by  the introduction of inappropriate agricultural technologies by western development organizations. The film also  portrays the gradual dissolution of subsistence-based living and the increased  dependency of the communities on a  cash economy (promoted by western-  controlled aid organizations like the International Monetary Fund).  In the film, we are introduced to  Gyarsi Bai, one of the 40 Rajasthani  women who, armed with fence posts,  heroidly fought to reclaim a small portion of their appropriated land. At one  point, she asks in bewilderment why,  when one considers all of the conditions  which cause her poverty, "aretherichso  concerned about the 'Sterilization of  women like me?" Later in the film, she  answers her own question: "They're  afraid of us. If we increase in numbers,  we might demand what they have."  Throughout the film, these sorts of  accounts are intercut with clips of advertisements (sponsored by organizations such as the Population Council)  which promote the importance of "making the population crisis an international  priority." One ad features US actor  Charlton Heston tallking about how  "helping them (as we are shown images  of hordes of generic brown people) con  trol the size of their families is the only  chance of preventing catastrophe for  all." Within the context of the rest of the  film, these ads expose the absurdity of  treating population as the primary problem of 'development' They also make  the racism at work in the population  control propaganda unquestionably  clear. In addition, they help illustrate the  insidious ways in which the rhetoric of  'helping others' can be used to help  ourselves, and obscure the inequitable  social and economic relations underlying the problems that population is said  to cause.  By blending the personal accounts,  critical historical analysis, and a sampling of propaganda campaigns, The  Legacy of Malthus is an incisive and moving look at modern population control  programs, the agendas that lurk behind  their operation, and the often brutal  means used to execute them.

She is currently working on the  South Asian section of the Women's Global  Film Project, a five part documentary series  onthemajorcontributionswomenhavemade  to global progress. The series is being produced by Maryland Public Television in the  US and upon completion, is slated to be  shown on 300 public broadcasting stations.  Last March, Seth gave a presentation at  the UNESCO International Symposium on  Women and the Media in Toronto titled,  "Women's Image in Developing Countries."  In it, shepointed to the new trend of women-  oriented films, noting that the only accepted  alternative to the portrayal of women as the  objects of male sexual fantasy is the portrayal  of women as "beaten, broken, humiliated"  victims of male oppression.  To illustrate her point, she looked at how  the film Bandit Queen profits from the  portrayal of woman as victim. BanditQueen  claims to be a true story of Phoolan Devi, a  lotoer-caste woman bandit in India who spent  ten years in prison for the murder of 30 high-  caste men, crimes she says she did not commit. The film essentially tells the story of a  woman who is repeatedly raped and eventually guns down her rapists.  Producers of Bandit Queen say they  based the film on oral diaries made by Phoolan  Devi while she was in prison, which were  transcribed into a bookbyMala Sen. [Devi is  illiterate.] But Phoolan Devi has criticized  the film as not being an accurate representation of her true story. She was not shown the  film before it was released.  Bandit Queen drew huge crowds at last  year's Toronto and Vancouver International  Film Festivals [see Kinesis, November 1994]  and is currently playing at theatres in some  North American cities. Seth points out that  while Bandit Queen has been hailed as the  definitivefeministfilmfrom India, it is infact  a reincarnation of the long-favoured, stereotypical tradition of rape-and-retribution  films in popular cinema. Ultimately, she  argues, the "market" continues to be the  determining factor in how women's lives are  depicted in the media.  Fatima Jaffer: At the symposium on  women and the media, someone pointed  out that we should be discussing the  issue of who owns the media and who  profits from images of women...  Aradhana Seth: As a TV-filmmaker,  I'm always nervous about taking a camera and photographing people because  of the issue of privacy. On the other hand,  if itdoesn't get done, it'llnever get shown.  For example, when somebody finally did  a good report on what was happening in  Rwanda, it mobilized a lot of people to  pay attention.  The question is, how do you tell an  honest story without victimizing the person, or making it slushy and sweet. You  have a responsibility to the person you're  filming, to your audience, and to the  message you're giving out.  Jaffer: In your presentation, you  mention that the male filmmakers of  Bandit Queen are profitting from what is  essentially a revictimization of Phoolan  Devi. The film is receiving a lot of attention, and Time Magazine in the US even  named itamongits top ten films of 1994.  Seth: There have been rave reviews  ofthefilmintheWestandinIndia...that  also say. ..this is among the best films to  come out of India. An extremely well  known reviewer in England, Derek  Mann, wrote mat if the film hadn't said  "Thisisa truestory," atthe beginning of  the film, it might have been too unimaginable a story to take seriously.  I don't believe I would have taken  this film as seriously as I have if it  wasn't supposed to be based on a true  story. I was really curious to see the film  because it was based on Phoolan Devi's  story.  Jaffer: In the book written by Mala  Sen, Phoolan Devi says she did not  want to talk about being raped, yet the  alleged rapes are central to the film.  Seth: Ultimately, the issue is not  about whether Phoolan Devi was raped  or whether she murdered the men who  raped her. The issue is, can you take  somebody's life and, without her consent, use it. Phoolan Devi did not want  to talk about whether she was raped,  and the filmmaker made a film about  her without even meeting her. How  The issue is,  can you take  somebody's life  and, without her  consent, use it.  could you do justice to the story? You  have to put it into a context.  On some level, every film about a  living person is going to get flak, but  something like mis is going too far. As  it is, women are reluctant to come out  and speak about rape because there's  such a stigma against it. Now someone  could make a film about it for a ticket-  buying audience who could [in turn]  say, "I'd like to see her being raped 16  times," or something.  Jaffer: You used Bandit Queen as an  example of a message you wanted this  forum to address. Could you tell us  what that was?  Seth: There are three messages. One  is that cinematically, this film is an art-  house remake of the regular rape-and-  retribution film seen in Indian cinema.  It's a mainstream film with a slightly  non-mainstream look, and because of  that, people are seeing it as this brilliant  masterpiece.  Aradhana Seth  Photo by Fatima Jaffer.  Just because the woman sits on a  horse, wears trousers and uses language  women aren't supposed to use, it seems  different. What also bothers me about  the film is that Phoolan Devi is a bandit,  yet the times we see her in a raid she's  doing something benevolent, like handing an anklet back to a little girl and  saying, "Keep that for your wedding."  It's stereotypical.  The other thing that bothered me  was the scene where she is married off.  Later her husband takes another wife.  After she becomes a bandit, she goes  back to that village and whips him. In  the book, she also whips his new wife.  The film doesn't show that because, from  the filmmaker's point of view, women  shouldn't lash out at other women. If  they had shown this, Phoolan Devi  wouldn't be pitied by the audience because she's a bad woman for beating up  this other woman.  At another point, Phoolan's bandit  lover is showing her not only how to use  a gun, but how to live in the ravines. But  she has lived and worked in and already  knows the ravines. He doesn't have to  teach her. It's like you living in Toronto  and somebody comes along and says,  "Come, I'll show you how to take a  subway."  Jaffer: What's your second message?  Seth: It is the issue of whether you  can show a woman's rape, [and if so,]  how you do it, and whether you have to  have her consent to do so. I don't think  the filmmakers expected Phoolan Devi  to be released from prison [after the film  was shot] and to start talking publicly  against the film. If she hadn't done that,  the issue of consent and other concerns  surrounding the film would not have  blown up to this extent.  The filmmakers haven't shown her  the film. They screened it for the "beautiful people" [mostly upper class/caste  elite], and then said, "She didn't want to  see the film."  Jaffer: The director says he invited  Phoolan Devi to see the film in Cannes  but she couldn't travel...  Seth: She doesn't have a passport [as  a former prisoner] and he knew that. But  the first time he showed the film in  Delhi, it was in a cinema a stone's throw  from where Phoolan Devi lives, but she  wasn't told it was showing.  Jaffer: What is your third message?  Seth: The issue of the rights to somebody's story when she may not have a  sense of her own rights. The question is,  would they have made a film like that  about me? They would have been scared  to do that. But Phoolan Devi is illiterate  and was in prison when the film was  being made.  It's notjust an issue of the rapes. The  caste portrayal in the film is also incorrect. She's going to have to face the  consequences of what they portrayed,  not only because the film says, "This is a  true story," but because film is such a  powerful medium that the film story  becomes the "true" story regardless of  the story itself.  Jaffer: One of the recommendations  made at this symposium is "to promote  the true image of women." During one  of the debate sessions, someone raised  an objection, asking how and who will  define that "true" image, whose truth  will it be, and do we even want to come  up with a "true image" of women. Can  there be a true definition given sexism in  societies...  Seth: ...and women's own  socialization?  Jaffer: Exactly. As a responsible  woman filmmaker who is trying to  change the stereotypes and images of  women in media, what does one do to  ensure women are not victimized by the  medium itself?  Seth: That's a damn tough question.  One is always aware you're falling into  some trap. You start with the truth. You  don't distort facts.  Jaffer: Is this why you work in documentary?  Seth: Even documentary has a lot of  problems becauseyou'realone in a room  with this technology making decisions.  The question is, do you only make films  about people who are similar to you? Do  you make films about people who have  a different situation from yours, perhaps a different educational background? How do you do it and still keep  their own story base?  I'm aware of what I want to hear or  that the way I see something may be  completely different, so I try to condition my mind to those possibilities. You  also have to think about why you decided to make a film about a particular  person or a particular issue. You have to  take responsibility for that because, no  (Continued in SETH page 24)  JULY/AUGUST 1995 Arts  om  Studio  D  of the  National  Film  Board  of Canada  Two outstanding new documentaries about aboriginal women,  now available on video!   m  SETH, from page 23  matter what you do, the film is never  going to be objective.  For example, I made a film on a  powerplant that was commissioned to  be built in Delhi. I thought the  powerplant was going to cause a mess.  It was on the banks of the Ganges River  on the seismic zone; they didn't have  any idea of what to do with leakages,  and so on. It would also mean forcing  people who live within 1.6 kilometres of  the plant to move.  The video was for Newstrack, a TV  news magazine in India that did five  stories each month, and was shown to  video-machine owning, English-speak-  ingaudiences—basicallythe people who  make the decisions. I decided to take on  the video because I knew my audience  would be the people who can stop the  plant from being built. I had been protesting the building of the plant before I  was asked to make the video so my  leaning was pretty obvious. But I knew  I would present both sides of the picture—that we'd talk to Mr. Atomic Energy, but we'd also talk to activists and  people who've been opposing the building of the powerplant.  Sometimes "balanced" is the subtlety of being subjectively objective. The  documentary I made is objective; you  can say that even as you watch it, because it presents all sides of the picture  and is fair. Obviously a bias exists on an  issue like that If it's done in an "objective" manner, I think it works better. If  it's too radically biased, if it becomes  obvious you don't want to listen to the  decision makers, you sometimes lose  your case before you've even started.
