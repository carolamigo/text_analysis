JigP^RfBt'tHlWIMi would  ^<- '^  goes          to  press  Well, before we tell you what disaster(s) befell us while going to press on our first issue  of 1993,1 guess we have to say Congrats to Kimmie Campbell, the ex-minister of justice who  isnow minister of defence. We're not going to play the mainstream media's guessing game—  hmm, is it a win for Kimmie or a loss? a "lateral arabesque" (?) or a "sideways move" or a  "boost" or a...surely, she's not planning on being the next prime minister...?  No, we're jus' so happy for her—she was always so great at defense. Not only do we  remember our battles with her over the right to choose, her latest proposed amendments to  the human rights act to sorta, kinda, well not really protect lesbians from discrimination  sorta, kinda, well really aren't that great. Defining spouses as "a man and a woman" kinda  puts a damper on a lesbian's options, we figure.  Speaking of rights, NAC's been pushing the feds to include women who fear abuse or  persecution because of their sex as part of the definition of a refugee. The feds say: "like,  er, we can't impose our values on the rest of the world. You see, nobody else is doing it...and  we don't want to open the floodgates to women fleeing abuse, now do we? And anyway,  don't we know there's that nasty refugee bill on the way in that's supposed to make it harder,  not easier, to flee to Canada...?" We know and we don't like it.  Meanwhile, NAC's working on lobbying for the feds to take a stand on the systemic rape  of Bosnian women—a stance that goes beyond the current state rhetoric: "yeah, isn't violence  against women a really bad thing?" "But."  While we're on about NAC, we might as well mention that Judy Rebick's term as  president of NAC is almost up and that a new president will be elected at the next NAC AGM  in June. We're hoping it'll be someone who has had the same kind of commitment to keeping  things as close to the grassroots as Rebick. Seems like it's also time a woman of colour got  to run as pres.  We really want to tell you about the di sasters that befell us on the way to press but.. .we're  on a roll and we've got to tell you about the possible cuts to women's services by the  secretary of state that's on the way. The word is, they'll be sia shing women's funding by ten  to 20 percent—some of the smaller women's organizations have already heard their budgets  are going to be cut. As it is, there's been a freeze on fed grants to women's centres for more  than three years. There are no economists in the production room tonight so we can't  calculate how much of a cut in funding over a time span that amounts to.  Have you noticed how all the governments in Canada seem to be "real broke" these  days? And how empty-coffer stories are on the front pages of dailies daily? And how  women get to "sacrifice" services for the good of the economy first?  Mind you, even federally appointed judges are feeling the pinch—they're considering  taking the government to court for freezing their $150,000 plus wages—they say it may be  unconstitutional to freeze their wages 'cos nobody talked to them first.  pHANKS  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

Join the Production Team at Kinesis  We never sleep  Call 255 • 5499  Speaking about not talking to anybody, maybe we should tell you now about the  disasters that befell us as we were going to press. If we make it to press.  We've worked through the night and it's morning now—a wonderful time o' the day  for a coffee and a little eavesdropping downstairs at the Cafe Roma...but, the phone rings,  forget about coffee...did you know that, as we go to press, the University of British Columbia  is challenging the Supreme Court in a case called UBC v. Berg to rule that the BC Human  Rights Act does not apply to the university as it has to do with its treatment of students?  Wait a minute—wasn't it two years ago, that the Supreme Court of Canada found that the  Charter doesn't apply to the university, only to governments. Now, UBC wants to be "a  human-rights free zone?" We'll keep you posted on that one.  By the time Kinesis hits the stands, it'll be Eating Disorder Week —a time to look at the  issues around anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and weight preoccupation. In Vancouver, call 631 -  5313 to find out what's on, event-wise.  February 7 to 13 is Haitian Solidarity Week. It's being recognized for the first time in  Vancouver and Co-op radio's what you'd want to tune in to if you want more info. That's  102 point something.  Actually, there's a lot going on in February. It's Black History Month [see calender, page  19, an dcentrespread], and International Lesbian Week's up as well [see story/calender, page 14].  Also, the National Association of Women and the Law is holding its annual conference  in Vancouver this year and the line-up of panels and workshops looks pretty good. On the  Saturday of the conference, (Feb. 20) there's a benefit dance/party/fundraiser for SAWAN  (the South Asian Women's Action Network) and the Asian Lesbians of Vancouver, and the  wheres, whos and whens will be posted up soon.  Hope ,ome of you remember that really neat film on lesbians of the 60s and 70s that  played du ng the last film festival in Vancouver? Well, Forbidden Love is on its way west  again. There's no word on when or where it's on in BC yet—the press release stopped at  Whitehorse (March 17th & 24th) and Calgary (Apr. 19-21).  We have just enough space (and time) for one more item: do we ramble on about how  we lost that story in the computer and where that graphic got to or how we called up everyone  in Vancouver to find out.or do we talk about the US elections, the pro-choice victory for  women in the States, and how, now-president Clinton had said when he was then wannabe president that US women's groups were "bean counters" 'cos they were bothering him  with demands that he get more women into his administration. Actually, we're out of space  so we'll talk about neither. Ah well, there's always another production-time disaster to talk  about, always another issue, always another time that Kinesis goes to press.  Well, it's 1993; We got a bit of a break  over the holidays—but somehow, the time  just flew by, and here we are in production  again. Lots has happened since November.  When we looked over our last issue, we  noticed we'd only mentioned the December  6th memorial once—in Bulletin Board. Our  apologies; we meant to run a photo, but it  was misplaced as we went to press. Ah well,  that's one more New Year's resolution to  add to the list. We'll do it right this year.  We're welcoming a new typesetter to  Kinesis this month—Sur Mehat has temporarily taken over from Dee Baptiste, who's  on a 6-month leave. Sur has been persuaded  to come on board with promises of non-stop  partying and gorgeous sunsets through the  enormous windows of the production room.  We didn't tell her that it was really non-stop  work and the sun sets only when we're not  in production. Welcome, Sur.  New on board this month is Luce  Kannen, who's taking over our regular feature, Paging Women, from Christine Cosby.  We're still going to see Christine around—  she's holding on to some of the administrative tasks she does for us. And we're thrilled  to have Luce back—missing those sleepless,  production nights, Luce?  There's another missing face around  Kinesis these days. Editorial Board member  Agnes Huang has taken a brief leave of  absence to finish off her degree, and to give  us a break from hoping she gets her articles  in before we go to press.  We have two new writers this issue—  perhaps because we chose to have our  monthly writers' meeting on the day Vancouver had a massive snow fall, (one of  many this season), we didn't have a great  turnout. New writers who made it through  the storm will be writing in the next issue.  For now, we'd like to welcome Andrea Yim  (who didn't make it to the meeting but sent  us her commentary in the mail) and Larissa  Lai (who's written for other publications but  says she liked writing for Kinesis best).  And for a change, we'd like to thank all  our diehard, ever-supportive, regular Kinesis reporters: Faith Jones (who hasn't written  in years but says it's like riding a bike—you  don't forget. Ha!); Manisha Singh (a second-  timer who survived a computer failure to get  us her story); Erin Mullan (who went to  Ireland for her story—no, we didn't pay her  way!); Susan Briscoe (who typed up her  story on coffee breaks at work); Ellen  Woodsworth (who never sleeps and always  delivers); Karen X. Tulchinsky (who's kept  us on top of what's happening at ILW for  years); Nancy Goldhar (another second-time  and, we hope, regular contributor); Cynthia  Low ("it's my first news story. Be nice.");  Gloria Russo (who showed up on a bad day  and saved the day); Michelle LaFlamme (who  tracked down and recorded most of what's  happening for Black History Month); and of  course our wonderful editorial board members/writers, Lissa Geller, Kathleen Oliver  and Ria Bleumer.  We had lots of production workers this  issue, but only one new hand: welcome to  Dorothy Conley, who's also doing a  practicum with Kinesis and has been an invaluable help over the last two weeks.  Thanks, Dorothy.  We're short a column this issue. We  promised to run a herstory series, but unfortunately, our article on the history of Women  Against Violence Against Women  (WAVAW) wasn't quite ready on time. We  will continue to run our series next issue,  however, with a piece on the India Mahila  Association. If you're interested in writing  for this series, call Fatima at 255-5499.  So that's it. We're back—mostly refreshed. Maybe not for long—we're already  back to bad production-time habits: pizza-  chomping; staringat computers for too long;  not sleeping; talking to our exacto-knives,  etc. But don't let it scare you away: most of  what happens at production is a lot of fun  and qui te empowering so i f you want to join  us, do drop in or call (604) 255-5499.  KINESIS  FEBRUARY 19r /W/////W///W//I'/''''  News  Women and the NDP government:  That was then; this is...  \^  by Faith Jones  When the New Democratic Party came in to  power in BCjnst over a year ago, Kinesis ran a  story celebrating the victory which began. "After 16 years of strategizing, realigning, wooing  the business sector, reassuring the left, badgering the Socreds, sitting high in public opinion  polls but still losing elections, the BC NDP is  finally in."  Optimism was to be found everywhere  among feminists in Vancouver. The feeling was  that, for the first time in years, women liad an  opportunity to get back what we'd lost under 16  years of Socred hell and make substantial gains.  The NDP were full of promises and women  were going to make sure the NDP respected its  commitment to communities to fund women's  advocacy ivorkat the grassroots, deal ivith issues  like domestic violence, settlement of Native land  claims and access to services for single ivomen  and children.  Tlmt was then.  This is now.  Vancouver feminists are critical of premier Mike Harcourt's economic policies,  especially after his televised pre-budget,  "state of the province" address on January  21. He is distorting the nature of the economic crisis and endorsing right-wing economic policies, they say.  While Harcourt and the media focus on  the "deficit monster," the heart of the economic problem goes unrecognized, says  VancouvereconomistMarjorieCohen. "Unemployment, regional disparity, and poverty are the real problems."  By focusing on the deficit, Harcourt has  to tighten spending. Increases for health  care and education will be held at three  percent, not covering the rate of inflation,  which is at over three percent this year. This  will mean a reduction in services, because  the need for social services is expanding in  BC. Not only is BC's population growing,  but it's demographics are also changing.  "An aging population puts greater demands  on health care," says Cohen.  In his address, the premier played up  the importance of paying off the debt.  A year ago, feminists were determined to  resist any attempts by the NDP to use the high  debt load left by the Socreds as an excuse for  delaying services.  "It zvould be un wise to sit back, especially in  light of much NDP talk of fiscal responsibility,  balanced budgets, building wealth and cautious  change—language that too often bodes ill for  social spending in general and for women in  particular," we said in our story a year ago.  Paying interest on BC's debt takes four  percent of the provincial budget, which  Cohen calls "insignificant." By comparison,  Ontario spends 13 percent of its budget to  pay its interest, and the federal government  spends 32 percent.  Rather than starve social services to pay  off the debt, Cohen believes the government  should invest in the infrastructure of the  province. By this, she does not just mean  roadsandbuildings. Schoolsand social services should be invested in: "They are industries and should be treated by public policy  as such," Cohen says. "I don't think it's any  accident that the things that are getting attacked are places where women are employed."  Christine Micklewright, of the BC Federation of Labour, agrees that freezes in  social service spending will affect women as  workers. In the area of pay equity, for  example, the government has failed to respond to the concerns raised by the labour  movement, which has been urging the government to adopt policies that would nar  row the pay gap between men and women  workers.  Although the government did establish  a consultation process, the resulting draft  paper on pay equity does not reflect  the concerns labour groups expressed,  Micklewright says. And with Harcourt's  announcement of only a three percent increase in health and education funding, and  no increase anticipated in other social services, Micklewright worries that workers in  those areas will not receive the kind of pay  "He's trying to appease people on the  left by not using the same rhetoric as  Mulroney," Cohen says.  Harcourt also announced that government ministries will be expected to cut bureaucratic costs this year. Activists in the  women's community fear the year-old Ministry for Women's Equality will be affected  by these cutbacks.  Over the past year, feminists have complained of understaffing at the Ministry for  Women's Equality, which has made it diffi-  Sunera Thobani, of SAWAN (the South  Asian Women's Action Network). "Especially when you lookat the rise in racism that  we're experiencing in society."  "It's more important than ever for us to  have centres that provide services to our  communities and the NDP needs to show  it's commitment to working with women's  groups."  In our election story in 1991, the Indian  Homemakers'Association—whose core funding  by the federal government was substan tially cut  years ago—said it planned to ask for direct  funding from the province to ensure improved  services for Native women.  While the Indian Homemakers' Association has received short-term project grants,  the status of their core funding has not  changed. Like many other groups, Indian  Homemakers may never meet the ministry's criteria, but may be good candidates  for provincial money. For example, the  DisAbled Women's Network is not a women's centre and may not qualify for membership in the BCNY.  raises that would address existing inequities.  "Although there has been some  progress made in making pay equity adjustments, those things don't stay still," says  Micklewright. If women workers do not  continue to get substantial pay increases, the  income gap between men and women will  widen again.  An end to  16 years of  Socred hell?  Micklewright is also critical of Harcourt's reliance on the tourism industry to  create new jobs. "I have a concern that the  jobs that will be created are low-wage jobs,  such as in the fast food industry," she says,  pointingout that most service industry workers are women and youths.  In his speech, Harcourt said his plan for  this year's budget was "a carefully balanced  approach" that rejected both the policy of  restraint and the idea of using government  spending to increase economic activity.  cult for women's groups to have access to  government.  "For the government to cut any money  from that ministry is a bigger statement than  other cuts, simply because women have  waited so long for a ministry of women's  equality," says Jennifer Johnstoneof the Vancouver Status of Women. "To cut back  something that hasn't really had a chance to  get going really undermines their credibility."  Last year, the Ministry for Women's  Equality gave 28 women's centres "core"  funding to a maximum of $37,500 per centre.  Johnstone is concerned that a freeze or decrease in that amount will affect service delivery because of inflation and increased  demand. "If the levels are the same in '93 as  '92, we're losing ground," she says.  In addition, more women's groups will  be competing for available money this year  than last year, as groups have had a year to  meet the Ministry's criteria. Groups must be  non-profit, community-based, registered societies, and members of the BC and Yukon  Association of Women's Centres (BCNY) to  be considered for core funding.  At least eight more groups meet the  criteria this year than did last year, and  nobody knows how the decision about which  groups get funding will be made.  "It's really important for the women's  organizations that have historically been excluded from access to funding to receive  some support from this government," says  "I don't think  it's any accident  that the things that are  getting attacked  are places where  women are  employed."  —Marjorie Cohen  |    But Cohen points out that, while funding grants are certainly nice to have, they do  not have a lasting effect like economic policy  can. Grant money can be stopped at any  time. What is needed is a systematic building of structures which provide services and  expand the economy, says Cohen.  "Just as schooling is expected of the  government, so should daycare be expected  of the government," she says. "And they  need to do it in such a way that another  government can't undo it."  Cohen points to the way the Mulroney  government has systematically carried out  its corporate agenda. Free trade and tax  restructuring have reduced the tax burden  on corporations and the wealthy. By contrast, the Harcourt government has not attempted to restructure the economy.  Both Cohen and Micklewright believe  the problem of regional disparity is serious  and should be directly addressed by government policy. So far, Harcourt has given no  indication that regional economic development will be a priority in this budget.  Cohen rates the raise in minimum wage  as the NDP's biggest accomplishment of its  first year in government. She also notes that  changes in the labour code are positive: "We  should get back what we had ten years ago."  In general, however, Cohen feels the  NDP has not made great strides. "To avoid  looking like the Barrett government [of 1972-  75], which did too much too quickly, they've  done too little too slowly," she says.  Faith [ones is a childcare worker in Vancouver.  FEBRUARY 1993 News  Newspaper prefers money:  Over our  dead bodies  by Susan Briscoe  Women responded quickly to a myso-  gynistic ad which appeared in a Vancouver  weekly during Violence Against Women  Awareness Week last December. The paid  ad defended the Montreal massacre of 14  women and praised the man who killed  them.  The ad copy was originally submitted  to the West End Times as an editorial and  refused. But when its author,CliveCowlard,  offered to pay for its publication as an advertisement, the paper's publisher, Bruce Coney, accepted.  December 6 ma ks the third anniversary of the massacre and is the first nationally recognized Day of Remembrance and  Action Against Violence to Women.  The December 2 edition of the West End  Times, however, made no mention of the  manycommemorativeeventshappeningthat  week. The only words about violence against  women ca me from the pen of Cowlard, who  paid almost $600 to publish his sympathy  for Lepine's hatred of women.  Cowlard is known by many as the man  who applauded during the moment of silence at the candlelight vigil, organized by  Women Against Violence Against Women  (WAVAW), on December 6th for victims of  male violence.  When the Vancouver Status of Women  (VSW) was alerted to the existence of the ad  and the nature of its content, "we sat down  and worked out a strategy," says VSW's  Jennifer Johnstone. "[The ad] was about  money to Coney, so that's how we went after  him."  Johnstone says that women felt that the  publisher had to do more than just apologise. VSW wrote to Coney and asked that all  proceeds from the sale of the advertisement  be donated "to a feminist, anti-violence  ...women felt that the  publisher had to do  more than just  apologise.  group in memory of the fourteen women  murdered on December 6,1989 in Montreal  and of all women who are the victims of  male violence"; and that The Times commission an article on the reality of violence  against women to be written by a feminist  for publication in the paper.  With the support of ten women's organizations, VSW faxed letters to all the  advertisers in that edition of the West End  Times and asked them to stop buying advertising from the Times until the publisher had  apologised and met the above demands.  Women's groups and lesbian organizations  said they would organise a boycott of those  businesses that did not pull- their advertising.  A week later, Coney sent a cheque for  almost $600 to WAVAW. The commissioned  article has still to appear, and it looks like the  wait may be long.  It appears that Coney does not feel it is  necessary to commission and print an article  on violence against women, because "this is  an ongoing policy of the West End Times."  He sent a package of "feminist-friendly  articles" recently published in the West End  Times to VSW, says Johnstone, and has had  one of the paper's male reporters outline the  services offered by WAVAW. The advertising boycott of the paper has not yet been  called off.  Despite Coney's reluctance to respond  to the women's groups'demands, Johnstone  says the groups are satisfied with the support they have received from advertisers  and the money that was sent to the rape crisis  centre.  But Zara Suleman of WAVAW is concerned about the likelihood of something  like this happening again. "It's very frustrating. I don't believe that [Coney] understood  how misogynystic, and wrong this was."  When Kinesis contacted Coney to ask  him whether the paper would be changing  its policies around publishing hate literature, Coney asked what Kinesis was, and  then refused to comment.  In a publisher's statement in the next  edition of the paper, Coney defended the  publication of the ad on the grounds that he  was allowing Cowlard "his right to freedom  of speech," despite the fact that it did not fall  into any category in advertising, and that it  violates the criminal code on hate literature.  "It's very frustrating.  I don't believe that  [Coney] understood  how misogynystic, and  wrong this was."  -Zara Suleman,  WAVAW  As the VSW's Miche Hill says, "legally,  he's not allowed to publish stuff like this. We  could have charged them. But we have to  ask: is that a good tactic? We decided not to  since stopping [Cowlard] was the goal.  Charges of publishing hate literature only  serve to give mysoginists more voice—all  that media coverage. We didn't want another Keegstra.  "We've accomplished what we needed  to do. We've let them know that this is not  acceptable. No other paper will publish him  now. It worked."  Susan Briscoe is a volunteer reporter for  Kinesis.  New women of colour magazine:  Zine but not herd  by Cynthia Low  Beezine, The Zine, Colour Zine, Static  Zine, The Rough and Ready Zine. Is Vancouver ready for a lesbian and bisexual women  of colour zine? What is a "zine"?  A zine, as defined by the women who  attended the first meeting of the lesbian and  bisexual women of colour zine, is a cheaply  produced, photocopied publication serving  the community that produces it. There are  no set editorial policies, no formal structure  and no granting agency involvement.  ...the only lesbian of  colour publication in  Vancouver...  Kinesis talked to some of the women  who attended the first meeting to find out  more about the only lesbian of colour publication in Vancouver, which is expected to hit  the "streets" this month.  "This is an opportunity for lesbian and  bisexual women of colour in Vancouver to  reflect freely on issues close to our hearts,  and to take the discussions that invariably  happen in our kitchens into a public, more  accessible arena," says Nadine, whoattended  the first meeting of the zine last month.  "Publications such as Kinesis and Vancouver's gay and lesbian publication, Angles, have very specific mandates, and their  histories have not included lesbians and bisexual women of colour to any meaningful  extent," says Nikola.  "These publications, and others such as  The Chinatown Times and Rungh, are important to us as women, lesbians and people of  colour but, there needs to be a space where  we can reconcile all of these identities/'says  Nikola Marin.  The act of creating the zine goes beyond  a reaction to being silenced by a dominant  culture, but "is a strategy to empower lesbians and bisexuals of colour through producing a culturally diverse product for our own  consumption," says Marin.  To Deanna Bowen, the zine means "that  lesbians and bisexual women of colour will  have a safe place to dialogue with each other  inan unconventional and open manner without being wary of 'spectators'." While this  does not mean women involved with the  zine will stop supporting the other publications, Bowen says, "community papers like  Angles and Kinesis need to be more inclusive  of lesbians and bisexual women of colour  and, as we know, that is changing. There are  more women of colour involved in these  newspapers than ever before, but it's not the  whole issue.  "I don't know if all the information that  will come out of the zine should be available  in Angles and Kinesis."  The act of creating  the zine..."is a  strategy to empower  lesbians and bisexuals  of colour through  producing a culturally  diverse product for  our own  consumption.  Bowen says she believes lesbians of colour outside the 'political' scene find it very  difficult to be a part of the community,  partly because of the nature of political activism but also because the community is so  spread out and involved in so many different areas.  "The zine is a way of networking that  doesn't require a lot of work and money and  protects people within the community. It  allows individuals to express themselves  openly. This will be a community bulletin  board, an unedited space to have public  dialogue," she says.  The zine is also a response to the need  for an alternative space for the growing  community of lesbians and bisexual women  of colour who work in many different areas  in the city to share histories and experiences  as a way of validating the diverse social  context of lesbians and bisexual women of  colour.  Lynne Wanyeki, one of the women who  coordinated the first meeting, says, "this will  not only be a product but a process—it is  accessible to women in a way that makes it  easy to participate fully without being a time  and energy-consuming."  Wanyeki says the group had discussed  the fact that publishing a periodical is costly  and requires funds, equipment and many  volunteer hours. Indeed, she says they realise one reason why the Vancouver lesbian  periodical, Diversity—the Lesbian Rag folded  was because of a lack of volunteers. "That's  another reason why we'd like to avoid forma 1 publishing constraints. This way, women  See ZINE page 6  FEBRUARY 1993 News  Referendum in Ireland:  A Pro-vote for Ireland  by Erin Mullan  Ireland's pro-choice movement finally  has cause for celebration after the Irish electorate voted to soften the country's extreme  anti-abortion stance.  The Irish government put three separate questions on the issue of abortion to  voters in a constitutional referendum on  November 25.  The first referendum question, if passed,  would have permitted abortion only when  the woman's life, as opposed to her health,  was threatened. It was defeated by a margin  of nearly two to one.  The other two questions covered the  right of a woman to travel outside Ireland to  have an abortion, and to have access to  information about abortion. Both were |  passed by substantial majorities.  "Pro-choice organizations were the only  grouping to campaign for the No/Yes/Yes  result," said Alliance for Choice spokesperson Ailbhe Smyth. "The sheer volume of Yes  votes [for the amendments on information  and travel] clearly indicates the electorate  has rejected the extremism of the 'anti-abortion' lobby."  The referendum victory is especially  welcome for the pro-choice movement,  which has suffered some major setbacks in  the last decade. In 1983, an anti-abortion  referendum enshrined "the right to life of  the unborn" as equal to "the right to life of  the mother" in the constitution. Since then,  Ireland's powerful anti-choice forces have  , NO YES WES  used court injunctions and intimidation to  shutdown crisis pregnancy counselling services, and to create a climate of silence and  fear around the issue of abortion.  -ThesilencewasbrokeninFebruaryl992,  when Irish police obtained a court injunction preventing a pregnant and suicidal 14-  year-old rape victim from having an abortion in England [see Kinesis, Apr. 92]. The  "X" case, as it became known in Ireland,  provoked a huge public outcry in the country and around the world. For the first time,  pro-choice demonstrations brought thousands out onto the streets of Dublin and  other cities.  The Irish supreme court overturned the  injunction in the "X" case, declaring that a  termination of pregnancy was permissible  when a "real and substantial risk" to a woman's life existed, in this case the threat of  suicide.  Rather than bring forward legislation  based on the supreme court decision as the  pro-choice movement demanded, the Irish  government opted for another abortion referendum. It also chose to put the question in  a way that specifically ruled out the threat of  suicide as grounds for allowing an abortion.  The referendum was set for December  3, but the sudden demise of Ireland's coalition government forced a general election,  and the referendum was brought forwa rd so  it could be held on the same date: November  25. Anti-choice campaigners called for a No/  No/No vote on the referendum. This time,  they would not get their way.  "For years, the anti-choice lobby has  acted as a self-appointed moral police force.  It has injected fear and paranoia into the  hearts and minds of Irish women and  healthcare professionals. It has used the  1983 amendment as a vehicle to enforce an  archaic and repressive system of censorship," said Smyth.  "The 'Yes' votes to travel and information are a categorical rejection of the anti-  choice lobby's actions by the Irish people.  As a people, we well understand the danger  of allowing extremists to impose their views  on our constitution. Never again."  The referendum result means the Irish  government will now bring forward legislation based on the "X" case decision. Smyth  says, "the lesson that has been learned from  the terror and pain of the last nine years is  that politicians can no longer shirk their  responsibility to legislate for crisis pregnancies and must introduce laws which constructively deal with the real life situations  faced by Irish women."  "...politicians...must  introduce laws which  constructively deal with  the real-life situations  faced by Irish women."  The government will also have to address the legal situation of the women's  clinics and student unions. Anti-choice  groups in recent years have obtained court  injunctions against both sets of organizations to try and stop them from providing  counselling or information about abortion  services in Britain. Pro-choicers are pressing  the government to have the injunctions lifted.  The referendum vote will not change  the fact that thousands of Irish women have  to travel to Britain each year in order to have  an abortion. At least now those women know  that the courts cannot be used to try to stop  them from going.  Erin Mullan is a Vancouver-based freelance  writer who recently returned from Ireland.  Rape is Still a War Crime  About 150 women gathered on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery on January  23 carrying placards that read: Stop the War On Women; Rape is a War Crime; US  Armies Rape Too; My Body is Not Your Political Territory; and Act Now Against  Serbian War Crimes.  The demonstration, called by the Women ot Colour Political Action Committee,  was a protest against the use of rape as a weapon of war.  Women gathered at the Gallery to hear speakers from the Black Women's  Congress, the Vancouver Status of Women (VSW) and Women Against Violence  Against Women denounce the systematic rape of women in Bosnia and other war  zones [see story, page 7],  "We demand the Canadian government take an active role in pushing for rape to  be declared a war crime under the Geneva Convention," said VSW's Miche Hill.  "We're very disappointed that the Canadian government hasn't got the moral  courage to speak out against this systematic torture of women and children in  Bosnia. As women well know this is not an isolated situation—ask any woman  who has lived in a country where military conflict has taken place."

Lesbians &AIDS  education project  The Lesbians & AIDS Education Project  (LAEP) was formed in Winnipeg, Manitoba,  in October 1990. In March 1992, LAEP produced a workshop with lesbian author and  sex therapist Joann Loulan and a safer sex  workshop model for lesbians and bi-women.  The workshop is being taped for inclusion in a locally made video, "The Pleasures  and Dangersof Lesbian Sex."LAEP willalso  be packaging safer sex kits to be distributed  in bars, stores and resource centres throughout Winnipeg and in some rural centres in  Manitoba.  LAEP's first activity was Women Loving Women, an AIDS 101 & Safer Sex Workshop in 1991 with monies LAEP received  through the federal health promotion directorate as a one-year project grant.  LAEP intends to apply for additional  funds this year for future projects. For now,  posters, workshop models and samples of  the safer sex kit can be purchased from  LAEP, Box 1521, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3C  2Z4.  Task force on  electoral reform  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) has established a  new task force following the referendum  experience.  During the constitutional debate, a major discussion on proportional representation and gender equity introduced this critical topic to the Canadian public. The Royal  Commission on Electoral Reform proposed  some important recommendations to  change the electoral system, but was instructed not to examine the issue of proportional representation.  The Task Force on electoral reform and  democratization will bring together research  by feminist academics and activists on how  proportional representation improves the  representation of women in politics. The  NAC Task Force will also examine proposals for democratizing policy development.  NAC Vice-President Shelagh Day will head  up the Task Force.  A parliamentary committee is studying  the Royal Commission report and should be  holding hearings sometime this year.  NAC's AGM  looks at the 90s  The theme of NAC's 1993 Conference  and Annual General Meeting will be "Taking Our Places: Feminism in the 90's." Panel  discussions will focus on building an inclusive, anti-racist women's movement and taking our places politically and economically.  The conference will also feature a panel of  young women who will discuss the future of  feminism. The AGM will be held at the  University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon  June 4 to 6.  Teen Voices  for women  Teen Voices, a US-based magazine for,  by and about teenage and young adult  women, is published four times a year by  Women Express Inc.  Women Express, a multi-cultural volunteer collective, was founded in 1988 to  empower teenage and young adult women  by providing skills, training and a national  communication forum.

More women of colour  have since expressed an interest in writing  for the publication.  As for concerns, Marlene Wong from  the now-defunct Diversity questioned the  inclusion of bisexuals. "Bisexuals have access to privileges in relation to men, and may  take issue with concerns that lesbians of  colour have, issues that bisexuals may not  want to deal with," says Wong.  However, Wanyeki says the women at  the zine acknowledged that sometimes  women of colour do not come out as lesbians, and that the zine did not want to exclude  Re-defy-ning  desh pardesh  The third Desh Pardesh (home away  from home) Conference/Festival of South  Asian arts, culture and politics, happens in  Toronto, March 24-28.  Desh Pardesh invites women to be part  of "re-defy-ning the South Asian 'community' from the perspectives, issues, artistic  and cultural expressions of women, working-class people, lesbians, gay men and other  progressive independent artists, thinkers and  activists living in Canada, the US and England."  The Women's caucus of Desh Pardesh  is organizing a woman-only space on site; an  evening program featuring the newest and  most challenging works by women artists; a  women of colour activists who are bisexual  and are aware of the politics of being a  lesbian.  So. An uncensored zine? A potentially  anonymous zine? Definitely a controversial  zine. The 14 women at the first zine meeting  left the meeting determined to produce the  first publication of its kind in Vancouver.  None of the women were able to say what  direction the zine may take once it gets off  the ground.  "The direction really depends on the  women; on who contributes to and works on  the zine. It will probably vary considerably  from issue to issue," says Wanyeki.  Women interested in joining the zine or  needing more information can call 737-0742.

Opening doors  for rural women  The Open Door, a newsletter for rural  feminists and lesbians, has re-emerged and  invites you to write with ideas about what  you would like to see in future issues.  An editorial in the first issue of The Open  Door says the newsletter will not shy away  from controversial issues such as AIDS, hunting, S&M, etc. The Open Door wants to include a "Rural Skills" section, where women  can share their expertise on everything from  animal care to zucchini recipes.  Another regular feature will be a  parenting page for mothers and others involved in child rearing, as well as a space  where Aboriginal women can share their/  our voices and views.

The West Coast Domestic Workers Association (OWA) in Vancouver has asked  the director of Immigration to review the  Filipina woman who was denied landed  immigrant status last September.  A coordinator and advocate with the  DWA says that Falcon was denied status  largely because she has three children currently living in the Philippines whom she  intended to sponsor once she was a landed  immigrant.  Lois Shelton says "this amounts to discrimination against women on the basis of  their family status. Falcon should be assessed on her own merits and granted status  and, if she chooses at some time in the future  to sponsor her children, she should then be  assessed with them in mind."  In the original decision to deny her status in April 1992, Falcon was told she had  failed to upgrade her skills sufficiently to be  able to support herself in Canada.  Following that, she took an nurse's aid  course three nights a week while still working full time.  When she made a new application complete with her upgrading, immigration officials claimed she had not "demonstrated the  qualities of adaptability, motivation, initiative and resourcefulness" necessary to live  in Canada.  This vague clause in the immigration  policies allows officials to make decisions  with little accountability.  Officials also claimed she wouldn't be  able to support her children in Canada, despite the fact that she has consistently sent  money home to support them since she came  to Canada.  Women who want more information or  who wish to help out are encouraged to  contact Lois Shelton at the DWA, 669-4482.  Special court  for child abuse  Children who have to testify in child  abuse cases in downtown Toronto will be  able to do so in a court designed specifically  for them as of March. The special court for  criminal trials of child abuse cases will be the  first of its kind in Canada and is being proposed as a one-year test to make abuse trials  less traumatic for child witnesses.  A court room in the Old City Hall in  downtown Toronto has been equipped with  screens to prevent children from seeing their  abuser, booster seats, extra-sensitive microphones to pick up children's soft voices, and  an adjoining room with colouring books and  crayons. A team of four specially trained  crownattorneyswillprosecuteallthedown-  town cases of abuse out of the one court  room.  Changes have also made in the way  cases will be tried. One crown attorney will  handle the case from beginning to end, so  that children will not be required to tell their  stories to several lawyers over and over  again.  As well, the court will hear only two  cases each day, one in the morning and one  in the afternoon, so that children will not  have to endure a long wait before testifying.  Laura Silver, a member of the prosecuting team, says often the only evidence of the  crime is the child's testimony. She says children are often frightened and traumatized  by having to testify in open court, especially  when the accused is in the room.  The court room, however, will still be  open to the public and there is concern that  the specific geographic location will attract  unwanted attention from onlookers.  Partial ban  on implants  Silicon breast implants are being taken  off the market in Canada, six months after  the US Food and Drug Administration  banned the implants in the US.  A spokesperson for the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective says the long-  overdue ban is a step in the right direction.  The implant has been linked to numerous medical complications, including arthritis and cancer.  Health and Welfare officials, however,  stopped short of banning implants altogether.  Breast implants will still be available for  women wanting reconstructive surgery following mastectomy.  Joy Langan, MP for Mission-Coquitlam,  who had her own implant removed late last  year, welcomes the ban but is concerned the  Ministry is not doing enough to protect  women's health.  "We're still in this headspace, saying  that a woman has to have reconstructive  surgery to somehow be a woman or be  beautiful."  The Ministry also stopped short of advising some 200,000 Canadian women who  have implants to have them surgically removed.  "More data is needed on the health and  safety implications (of removal)," says Health  Minister Benoit Bouchard.  She won—  or did she?  were being made to First Nations people as  "savages," Pitawanakwat had to fight the  senior department official about whom she  was complaining from trying to prevent the  case from going ahead. She then had to fight  the Secretary of State's office twice in federal  court, just to have her case heard by the  CHRC.  The most bitter pill to swallow, however, was the "remedy" proposed by the  commission. The report's authors suggest  that the Secretary of State reimburse  Pitawanakwat for only two of the six years  of lost wages, and offer her in a job outside  of Saskatchewan, sincethere is "fartoo much  bitterness between parties" to reinstate her  in Regina.  In fact, although the commission  condemned the behaviour of two of  Pitawanakwat's superiors, she is the one  who will have to pay the price in lost wages  and having to relocate.  Judy Rebickof the National Action Committee on the Status of Women says, "if this  decision is allowed to stand the way it is  ...human rights in this country is a sham."  Fighting  UI cuts  After eight long years of battling  racism in the federal bureaucracy, Mary  Pitawanakwat was expecting vindication.  But when the Canadian Human Rights Commission finally handed down its decision on  the case of racial harassment and discrimination case she had brought before them, the  Ojibway-Potawatami woman was told she  was partly to blame for the racial harassment and discrimination she endured while  employed as a social development officer in  Regina.  The tribunal accused Pitawanakwat of  contributing to the "sad state of affairs" by  her "initial inaction" and reduced her award  on that basis. "Not a single person has been  penalized for the violations I encountered,"  Pitawanakwat says.  Following the CHRC's report to the  Secretary of State, women's groups and labour are calling on federal human rights  commissioner to review the Canadian Human Rights Commission's (CHRC) decision.  Sharon Mclvor of the Native Women's  Association of Canada condemns the findings in the report as "offensive," and victim-  blaming of the highest order.  Mclvor points out that "the tribunal  penalized Mary for the delay in bringing her  case before the Human Rights Commission  and neglected to mention that the Secretary  of State and the commission delayed the case  for four years."  Susan Giampetti of the Public  Service Alliance of Canada says she is outraged that the CHRC tribunal condemned  Pitawanakwat for not initially pursuing  her complaint more vigorously.  "It ignores the reality of who has power  in the workplace...(The report) doesn't even  understand the power relationships at play  here," she says.  After initially filing a complaint in 1984  about sexual harassment and references that  Labour and women's groups are fighting the slash in unemployment insurance  benefits, compliments of the federal Tory  government, in the worst recession since the  1930s. There have been demonstrations at UI  offices across the country since the announcement of a three-percent cut in UI benefits to  the unemployed.  If the proposed cut in benefits is approved, UI benefits will also be denied to  those who "voluntarily" quit their jobs or are  fired will not be eligible to claim UI.  The cuts will primarily affect women-  women who are sexually harassed on the  job, women of low income status, and mothers who cannot find child care. In fact, 53  percent of all voluntary UI quits are women,  compared to 37 percent of all UI claimants.  Further, 43 percent of voluntary quits are in  low-income occupations compared to 28  percent of total claimants. This could leave  poorer women in vulnerable job situations  with their backs to against the wall.

L -word  sparks attack  The Hamilton and Area Sexual Assault  Centre is under attack and could lose its  funding over a controversial ad that encourages lesbians to apply for a position at the  centre.  Regional councillors are criticizing the  inclusion of the L-word in a want ad that  reads: "women who are culturally/racially  diverse, Aboriginal, lesbian and/or disabled are strongly encouraged to apply." The  ad appeared in the Saturday and Monday  editions of the Hamilton daily, The Spectator.  The wording is discriminatory, says a  Hamilton councillor, and the "sexual orientation issue belongs in the bedroom, not  when you go for a job interview."  The centre has been warned that its  $17,000 regional grant is now in jeopardy.  Vilma Ross of the Hamilton sexual assault centre says the centre's policy will be to  "hang tough" and not back down. According to Ross, the centre used the wording to  counter the continuingdiscriminationagainst  lesbians in society.  "They know there is discrimination  against gays and lesbians. They should be  absolutely ashamed of themselves," says  Pissed off with  Kiss & Tell  A Vancouver-based lesbian performance art show has been called "god-awful"  and "abhorrent" by the deputy premier of  Alberta.  The performance of True Inversions in  November by the Kiss and Tell Collective at  the Banff Centre for the Arts, was part of an  exhibition called "Much Sense: Erotics and  Life."  "We've been called 'god-awful'before,",  says Kiss & Tell's Persimmon Blackbridge,  "but we've never had 'abhorrent'. Guess  we're in a different bracket now."  The show was panned by the magazine  Alberta Report, which ran a full-page story  with the headline: "Kissing and Telling in  balmy Banff", and subtitled: "Banff hosts the  latest in subsidized alienation and lesbian  porn."  The report lambasts the government  for providing grants "from empty coffers"  to the gallery where the performance took  place.  And deputy premier Ken Kowalski,  who was not at the performance, has asked  the Minster of Advanced Education (whose  ministry funds the Banff Centre) to "put an  end to the homosexual shows at government-funded institutions."  Nancy Millar of the Alberta Status of  Women Action Committee says Kowalski is  "completely out of line. He's not the culture  minister. He's homophobic."  Members of the arts community are  fearful that an attack on Kiss & Tell is part of  a larger agenda to cut arts funding even  further. Duval Lang of Quest Theatre in  Calgary says these attacks make it easier to  justify gutting funding.  "They (the government) are going after  targets that produce the most significant  aftershock in Alberta communities."  New Gallery spokesperson Sandra  Vinda is also concerned about censorship.  "We want to support the artists' right to  present material that could be controversial.  We don't want to handcuff them before they  start."  The Banff Centre of the Arts is funded  publically, but is operated by an independent board.  According to the Centre's vice-president Carol Phillips, they were contacted by  the Minister of Advanced Education's office  but now consider the matter closed.  Funds to fix up  child care centres  Twenty-eight child care centres across  BC will receive grants of under $5,000 each  from the Ministry for Women's Equality.  The grants are intended to help child  care centres upgrade their facilities, buy new  equipment, and help centres comply with  the new licensing requirements of the Ministry of Health.  In Vancouver, the bulk of the money is  supposed to go towards repairing leaking  roofs, replacing unsafe equipment, buying  furnishings and laundry equipment, and  upgrading playgrounds.  The grants affect the facilities of some  850 children in the province, the bulk of  them in Vancouver.  The ministry says it is also currently  reviewing 20 other applications for funding  from child care centres.  FEBRUARY 1993 What's News  Words that count  women in  The Ontario Women's Directorate, an  arm of the Ontario provincial government,  has published a 36-page guide to the use of  non-sexist and inclusive language.  The guide contains a glossary of words  that are sex-specific and provides substitutes, such as using "letter carrier" instead of  "mailman."  Carol Zelniker, director of public education with the Women's Directorate, says  the ministry has no mandate to suggest or  require the use of non-sexist language in  governmentdocuments. However, theguide  was produced following "a steady stream of  calls over the years from businesses and  other groups asking for advice on how to  avoid unconsciously excluding women in  everyday language."  The publication has seen a strong backlash from anti-feminist groups, calling it an  attempt to legislate the use of language. One  editorial in the Toronto Star said the guide  "castrates" the English language.  "That something as innocuous as this  could create such a backlash is really frightening," says Zelniker.  Beverly Bain of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women says she  is not surprised by the backlash. "To start  changing linguistically means you have to  change the way in which you perceive, and  some people are unwilling to do that," says  Bains.  This guides joins many that have been  published by media organizations and government ministries across the country.  Guns are  ugly enough  Women's groups are demanding the  UnitedNations recognise rapeasawarcrime  and a violation of human rights following  media reports of the violent and systematic  rape of muslim women in the former Yugoslavia by Serbian soldiers. Women in Canada  are also demanding the Canadian government strongly oppose and act against Serbian war crimes.  About 20,000 muslim women in Bosnia  have been raped by Serbian soldiers as part  of a campaign to terrorize the community  and drive people from their homes.  "Rape has always been a key element in  waging war. The rape, torture and murder  of women is nothing new. What is different  is that the raping of muslim women and  children by Serbian troops is not only a  calculated attempt at inflicting maximum  humilation on the victims, but is being used  as a form of 'ethnic cleansing'," says Miche  Hill, spokesperson for the Women of Colour  Political Action Group (PAG) in Vancouver.  The human rights organisation, Amnesty International, only defined rape as a  form of torture in 1991.  PAG held a rally on January 23 to protest the systematic violence against women  worldwide [see story, page 5]. PAG is demanding the international community take  action against these atrocities, and put a stop  to the military strategy of rape in every  national conflict globally.  Investigators from the European Community sent to Bosnia, led by British diplomat Anne Warburton, produced a report  that contains accounts of repeated rapes of  women and children and says it is likely  "many women, and more particularly children, may have died during or after rape."  It goes on to note that women are being  raped in ways designed to be particularly  sadistic and humiliating. Women report  being raped specifically so they would be-'  come pregnant with Serb babies, and say  they were held captive until their pregnancies were too advanced for them to obtain  abortions under Yugoslav law.  The delegation obtained first-hand reports from muslim women in detention  camps and small, rural villages. The report  concludes that Serbian forces are terrorizing  communities with the full knowledge of  their superiors.  "It's time to stop pretending rape is just  a casual by-product of war. It is systematically used wherever men are fighting wars  as a tool of war against women, as a political  weapon against women," says the PAG's  Cynthia Low.  And a report issued on January 8 by the  human rights group Americas Watch, documents the rape and torture of Peruvian  women by government and police forces .  The report states that the abuse of women is  "a form of tactical warfare" used by the  government in its 13-year civil war against  the rebel group, Shining Path.  The report states that rape and torture  are carried out with "the express purpose of  intimidating [women] and their peers, and  terrorizing their families and communities."

Women lose choice  in Poland  Women in Poland have lost the right to  abortion on demand following the approval  of legislation to ban abortions except where  the fetus is seriously deformed or the pregnancy threatens a women's life or health.  The parliamentarians, largely men,  voted on January 8 to criminalize the performing of "unapproved" abortions and rejected the call for a national referendum on  the issue. Opinion polls had indicated that  the majority of Poles oppose a ban on abortion, which was legal in the country from  1956 until the fall of the communist government in 1989.

Legislators removed these parts  of the original bill but refused to legalize a  woman's right to choose.  A fight  for compensation  A women's group in the Philippines is  planning to file a suit in April against the  Japanese government for forcing women to  be sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during  World War II.  The Task Force on Filipina Comfort  Women says it has documented 31 cases of  women being kidnapped and systematically  raped as sex slaves during the Japanese  occupation of the Philippines from 1942-  1945.  In a press conference in Manilla, Julia  Porras, a Filipina forced into the sex slavery,  told of being raped by three or four soldiers  every night for eight months when she was  just 13 years old.  A spokesperson for theTaskForce,Indai  Sajor, said the Japanese government has offered an out-of-court settlement to set up a  foundation for the approximately 200,000  "comfort women" worldwide. The settlement, however, did not include monetary  compensation.  The Task Force has also called on Filipino President Fidel Ramos to support their  claims for an apology and compensation.  Prostitution to be  legal in Hong Kong  Without consulting women who work  in the sex trade industry, government officials in Hong Kong are making moves to  legalize prostitution and act as their pimp.  According to the Head of the Mongkok  anti-vice squad, the state would register  women and tax their incomes, using the  incomes to "control and improve" the "problem," and essentially as pimps for approximately 2,000 prostitutes in the Mongkok  area.  Women's groups have reacted strongly  to the proposal. The coordinator of the Harmony House Women's Refuge in Mongkok  says, "there are no trade unions for prostitutes, they have no representation."  The chair of the Association for the  Advancement of Feminism, Cheung Choi-  wan, notes that prostitution should be legalized, not licensed. "I see it as the government wanting to control and regulate  prositution. Itisstereotypinga certain group  of women and discriminating against prostitutes."  The government has taken the attitude  that, since prositution is a "necessary evil",  they may as well benefit from it financially.  New domestic  workers' association  The Committee for Domestic Workers'  and Caregivers' Rights was formed on December 13 in Vancouver by approximately  50 domestic workers and their supporters.  By forging links with and drawing moral  and material support from existing anti-  racist, immigrant and refugee rights, labour  and women's groups, the Committee intends to present an agenda with a wide  range of issues.  A spokesperson for the interim steering  group says important issues for domestic  workers are not confined simply to labour  rights.  "Because of the colour of our skin and  our national origin, we are denied certain  rights and privileges. ..because we are mostly  women ...we are denied the respect and  material benefits that are given other workers doing work of comparable value," says  Lorina Serafico.  By raising awareness of these issues and  lobbying for change in federal and provincial legislation, the group hopes to create  positive change for domestic workers/  caregivers in BC.  Among topics the Committee has lined  up for discussion in its support groups are  workshops on women's health, sexual assault, sexual harassment, racism and cultural awareness.  The group is currently establishing relationships with NAC, the Legal Services Society, the West Coast Domestic Workers Association, Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile  Women's Union, Latin-American Women,  and Filipino-Canadians Organizing for Action.  In addition to a support and advocacy  group on the lower mainland, the Committee hopes to organize groups in smaller communities in the interior and on Vancouver  Island. These groups would include regular  information and orientation meetings, and  recreational and social activities.  -flfifAVeaT Annivcrsary C^bmtior, i  20% off with This coupon  Qood Food Store vfe  ORGANIC PRODUCE S&r*  biggest election & best prices in Vancouver  BULK ORGANIC  Produce •Creiot •Cerecls •Piiti • Herbe  I  i      ^np Restaurant & Juice Bar  | '"^ Meet, Egg & Dairy Free -All Organic  fQrdingDavv^ *SW open10.9daiIyi  j Organic Foods   " 1045VCommercial Drive ph. all-bean I  jCo^ll^e CtJ VC   Supi ible Agriculture* Native Sovereignty ,  FEBRUARY 1993 Commentary  Work at a rape crisis centre:  Choosing our battles  by Andrea Yim  Well, another December 6 has passed us  by and with it, another wave of white robes,  oops, I mean ribbons.  I don't really know about other women  out there but the whole White Ribbon thing  left me extremely frustrated. Not that I have  anything against white ribbons in particular. It's just that, well, it's hard for me to  cheer these men on in their quest to distribute millions of white ribbons to "help" us  fight violence against women. Who are we  kidding if we think this is going to really  make a difference?  Sure, they probably won't hurt anybody since the corporations that have given  them those hundreds of thousands of dollars would probably never donate that  amount of cash to an organization that was  really going to help women.  I work a t a local rape crisis centre and, as  the media liaison person here, I ended up  spending most of "Violence Against Women  Awareness Week" either taking media calls  on how "we" felt about the white ribbons or  dealing with men who'd read my comments  in the daily newspaper and wanted to discuss them with me.  Not surprisingly, many of my comments were taken out of context by these  men. One man told me he had a problem  with my comments that women at this rape  crisis centre were angry at the amount of  money being spent on the White Ribbon  Campaign. Imagine, the nerve I had to be  angry to hear they received over $400,000 to  fund their project for one year, when rape  crisis centres and transition houses and other  feminist organizations struggle to get by on  so much less!  /  /  The ongoing joke  at the office is  about talking to  the media where...  we answer  automatically,  "We are outraged."  When I tried to explain that I really  didn't have time to justify feminist politics  with them while I was taking crisis calls,  they seemed confused. "What do you mean  you don't have time to talk to me—a perfectly nice guy? Well, yes, I'm white and  straight and able-bodied, upper class, university-educated and have never donated to  women's groups and what does 'misogyny'  mean again? But 1 just want to get involved  in this "Violence Against Women Week'  thing!"  Hmmm. Maybe I've become too angry,  too radical, too unsympathetic to those poor  men who feel excluded by us "powerful"  feminists. Really, come on.  On December 7, the day after  Women Against Violence Against Women  (WAVAW) held the annual vigil on the steps  of the Vancouver Art Gallery to remember  all women who have died as a result of male  violence, I found myself staring at our newspaper clipping board and reading about all  the violence against women that those fantastic white ribbons were supposed to eradicate.  I talked to the media about the woman  who was abducted and raped by three men  at the Broadway Skytrain in Vancouver on  December 6, and again, about the child-  molesting bishop in BC who got off on a  legal technicality. Yet these sensitive men  with their $50 enamelled white ribbons got  For women who are stretching boundaries  And think broadest maybe describes them best  And wonder if women's clothes in size 0  Isn't really some very bad jest  FOFwomen out there who are larger  And realize this is their fate  I carry clothes that are bigger  I know, isn't that that great!

Now, I'm the last person in the world to  say I can't believe stuff like this happens, or  I'm surprised at how much support men get  for their token gestures while feminists are  targeted at every turn for challenging the  status quo. The ongoing joke at the office is  about talking to the media where, regardless of the issue or question being asked, we  answer automatically, "We are outraged",  with eyes slightly glazed over and voices at  a monotone.  I mean, really, how do you react when  you are asked, "what do you think of the  woman who was murdered by her partner?", "what do you think motivated the  man who raped the 14 year old girl?", "how  do you feel about the MLA who wrote the  letter in support of a convicted rapist?"  We're outraged, right? We're angry, aren't  we? Well, of course.  But in response to the men who call me  up and ask why we aren't writing letters of  outrage over the bishop, the MLA, the  batterer, the College of Physicians and Surgeons—fill in the blank with whomever you  like—I have to answer that we have been  doing this for years but we aren't equipped  to mobilize over every article we read in the  paper and throw a rally or send out petitions, etc. And hey—what's stopping all  these sensitive guys from picking up a pen  anyway?  We cannot mobilize over every article  the media happens to print on violence  against women because tomorrow, we will  still have to read all the new articles about all  the dead women, and we will still have to  answer the crisis line and offer that much-  needed support to the woman who was  raped, battered, sexually abused, ritually  abused, sexually harassed—last night, last  week, last month, last year.  We still have to deal with that local  paper that printed a paid advertisement in  which a certain misogynist—how can we  keep track of them all?—apologized to Marc  Lepine for feminists' actions [See story, page  5[. We cannot afford the luxury, except for  one day of the year—December 6—to stop  and mourn and cry for the women we have  lost. If we did this for every woman we  know who endures male violence, we might  never be able to stop long enough to answer  the crisis line.  So, instead, we choose our battles carefully, always keeping close track of how  much energy will be left for tomorrow. I  know this all sounds a bit hard and cynical,  nothing new for most of the women I know.  But it's not about ignoring what's happening out there to us. It's about surviving long  enough to try to make some small difference. Maybe we won't put away a rapist  today but, perhaps a few women who call  the crisis line will come away feeling a bit  more certain it's not their fault and that they  deserve to feel good about being women.  And maybe a man won't call the office  today and tell me, "you'd better do something about the judge who let another rapist  off scot-free because I'm really angry about  it."  Oh, and maybe the letter I'm going to  write to the publisher of that west-end paper  about the misogynist advertisement he  printed by Clive Cowlard will make him  realize his mistake. Let's see, how should I  start? "Dear Mr. Coney, We are outraged..."

FEBRUARY 1993 Feature  North American Free Trade Agreement:  Saying no  to NAFTA  by Ellen Woodsworth  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is being introduced into parliament in February. If the governmenthas its way,  it will become law by the spring of this year.  Now, more tlian ever, there is an urgency for  women to act. The following is a summary of  why women in Canada, the US and Mexico are  organizing to stop NAFTA. It is also a summary  of why you may want to join this fight:  Women's Jobs  The Canada-US Free Trade Agreement  has already helped to destroy more than  500,000 manufacturing jobs and hundreds  of thousands of jobs elsewhere in the  economy. Many of these jobs were done by  women, especially women of colour, immigrant, and Aboriginal women.  The North American Free Trade Agreement will cost women hundreds of thousands more jobs as corporations use the deal  to pit Canadian, American and Mexican  women against each other. This especially  hurts women workers in the garment, textile, fishing, telecommunications, health,  public service, agricultural and manufacturing areas. Anyone left?  A 2,000-page secret  NAFTA is an attack on democracy. The  deal was made in secrecy. Even the members  of the committee hearing briefs on the deal  couldn't get copies. The Vancouver-based  Woman to Woman Global Strategies group  still can't get copies.  NAFTA is a 2,000 page document that  undermines laws by federal, provincial, and  municipal governments (unless specifically  exempt). The Free Trade Commission and  Secretariat will be set up to oversee the implementation of the agreement with no accountability to citizens. Laws set up to protect our health, jobs and environment will  be struck down as "barriers to trade."  Transnationals gain new powers to directly  challenge Canadian legislation, while we, as  well as our governments, are denied such  rights.  NAFTA panels will be established to set  standards and rules for the continent. Final  say over the legitimacy of any government—  federal, state or provincial—will rest with  these panels. They will be closed to the general public and their reports will be confidential.  Competing with each other  NAFTA requires that all government-  run operations, from pension plans to garbage collection, be open to competitive bids  from other countries. Provincial practices  that favour local firms, or promote local  hiring^, will be subject to challenge from the  NAFTA panels, as will government-subsidized training programs, women's programs  in carpentry, the Everywoman's Health Collective, and our transition houses, for example.  Commercialization of Crown Corps  NAFTA includes new provisions that  impose a commercial definition on Canadian Crown Corporations, both federal and  What to do  by Ellen Woodsworth  provincial—that is, for example, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), BC  Hydro, VIA Rail, and the Insurance Corporation of BC (ICBC). These provisions will  likely be used to constrain governments from  directing these enterprises to act as agents of  government policy—such as conservation  and pay equity—and will require them to  behave like private firms.  Patents and copyrights  NAFTA includes an extensive chapter  on patents and copyrights. It allows private  companies to claim ownership of living  matter such as fetal tissue.  Protecting the environment  NAFTA is environmentally unfriendly.  Like the Free Trade Agreement it hinders  conservation and fails to stop large-scale  water exports, even in times of Canadian  shortage. It facilitates the flight of dirty in-  j  dustries from Canada to areas that have little  incentive to upgrade current lax environmental standards. It includes a comprehen-   \  sive, downward harmonization of health   !  standards in areas such as pesticides, food  additives and toxins. NAFTA does not in-  cludeenforceable environmental protection.  Non-renewable resources  NAFTA extends the continental sharing of our non-renewable resources, such as  oil, gas and basic petrochemicals. As with  the FTA, Canada—but not Mexico—must  keep shipping these resources south to meet  the huge US demand—even in the event of a  national shortage and at a price no higher  than we charge Canadians.  BothCanada and Mexico will lose policy  tools such as export taxes and quotas, to  manage and protect these resources.  Control of forest lands  NAFTA and the FTA would be violated  by any Canadian move to restrict or diminish foreign control of forest lands. Mexico  won an exemption and will continue to restrict foreign ownership in the forest sector.  Losing a way of farming  More family farms will be lost because  NAFTA benefits large-scale agricultural  businesses. Policies of national food security  and survival of rural Canada are subordinated to the "market".  All remaining agricultural goods will  see the gradual elimination of import controls. This will encouraged open competition among the farmers of the continent,  regardless of the wages they pay their employees, their environmental practices, their  health safety standards, freshness of product and availability of local produce.  More power to US banks  NAFTA will curtail our provincial governments' jurisdiction over loan, trust, mortgage and security companies. The FTA already exempts US banks from Canadian  restrictions on foreign-owned banks. NAFTA  will give other foreign financial corporations more power by guaranteeing them the  same treatment as Canadian firms. They will  be able to freely transfer and process infor-  Anthropologist Margaret Mead once wrote: "Never doubt that a small group of  thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever  has."  The following is a to-do list for women who want to join in the struggle to defeat  NAFTA:  Take 15 minutes  On February 20 at 1:00 pm, we call  on all Canadians to ring school bells,  church bells, parliament bells and town  hall bells, or to beat pots and pans to  warn people of the dangers of passing  NAFTA. Take this day to begin or to step  up, inside and outside of parliament, the  fight to save democracy and Canada.  Hold marches, vigils, occupations.  Put on black arm bands the day  they introduce NAFTA in the House of  Commons.  Make a sign opposing NAFTA and  put it up in your window.  Read an article on NAFTA so you  know more about it. Women to Women  Global Strategies or your local Action  Canada Network have lots.  Phone a friend and talk to them  about NAFTA and the Free Trade Agreement. Pass along what you know and  what you've read.  Call or write a politician and tell  them why you are in favour of terminating the FTA and why you want NAFTA stopped. Ask for their support. Ask them to  publically call meetings and to speak out against NAFTA.  Make sure you are registered to vote in the next election. Make sure that you and all your  family and friends are enumerated prior to the election. Make sure they vote.  Send a financial donation to Women to Women Global Strategies, c/o 1426 Napier St.,  Vancouver, BC, V6L 2M5, or call (604)430-0458  Take half an hour  Write a letter to Audrey MacLaughlin, leader of the federal NDP, and to Jean Chretien,  leader of the federal Liberal party. Ask them to ensure their parties are prepared to fight tooth  and nail to stop NAFTA and to terminate the Free Trade Agreement. Write c/o Parliament  Buildings, Ottawa, Ontario, KlA 0A6. No postage necessary when writing to federal  Members of Parliament.  Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper.  Call in to radio phone-in shows to express your opinion or to question politicians or  others on the deal.  Write a letter to your member of parliament expressing your opposition to NAFTA.  Ask for their active support in fighting it.  If you are a member of a group, union, or other organization, get them to pass  resolutions against the deal, and to print articles as well as take action against it. Send the  resolution to the politicians and the media.  Take an afternoon  Call a meeting on NAFTA and have a speaker. Watch the Women to Women Global  Strategies video or the Action Canada videos: We Can Say No and Fight Back. Copy them and  pass them on to friends. At the end of your meeting, decide what each of you can do.  Organize a 'coffee klatch against NAFTA.' Raise some money and start your own  Women to Women Global Strategies group. Write letters together and plan actions.  Get involved with your local women's group, community centre, or union local and get  a coalition going against NAFTA. Get them to bring in a speaker from Women to Women  Global Strategies or the Action Canada Network .  Occupy MP offices if they won't oppose NAFTA.  As E. Burke once said, "nobody made a greater mista ke than the person who did nothing  because they could only do a little." Remember, the reason we all know so little about this  deal is part of their strategy to keep us from fighting back.  mation for their "Canadian activities" outside the country, putting data processing  jobs at risk and threatening privacy laws.  NAFTA also permits the inclusion of  other countries in Latin America and the  Caribbean to create a huge, borderless, economic zone. Unlike the European Community's trade agreement, NAFTA contains no  minimum social, labour, human rights or  environmental standards—and no mechanisms to raise, rather than lower, wages.  Unlike the European model, this hemispheric zone will be dominated by one country—the US—and has been designed for one  reason: to benefit transnational corporations  and privileged minorities.  And as Marilyn Waring, the lesbian  feminist economist from New Zealand, puts  it: "a system cannot respond to value it  doesn't recognize." NAFTA only recognizes  corporate wealth. It cannot respond to values such as that of our unpaid work, the  value of peace of mind, the necessity for  global peace, the basic right to clean air,  water and soil, and to housing, food and  education for every citizen of the world. The  pursuit of corporate values does not address  the personal being of each of us, of women,  our country, this hemisphere and this world.

FEBRUARY 1993 Feature  Women in the Philippines and Sri Lanka:  Fighting back globally  More and more, women are making the  connections between individual acts of violence  against women, and political, economic and social acts of violence against women globally. The  following are excerpts of presentations madeata  workshop called "Sticks and Stones—Women  Fight Back: Rethinking Strategy to Fight Violence Against Women Globally." The workshop  took place at the Canadian Research for the  Advancement of Women's conference, Making  the Links: Anti-Racism and Feminism conference in Toronto last November.  Raauel Edraline Tiglao is the executive  director of The First Women's Crisis Centre and  was involved, in the past, in radical nationalist  organising in the Philippines.  I would like to connect the issues of  militarism, international tourism and trade,  and migration of labour, as connecting phenomena forwomeninthe 'Third World' that  have spawned wide-scale violence against  Militarism has clearly brought about a  lot of brutalised sex or sexualized torture of  5 women in our country. It is a little known  fact, perhaps, that the Philippines has been  undergoing a national liberation struggle of  its own for the past 20 years, or that women  are spearheading efforts for a peace process  that will hopefully bring about peace accompanied by justice in our country. Or that,  in the Philippines, as in many other countries where there is war, it is always the  women who are really most affected.  In the beginning, when tourism was  used by ourcountry to improve the economy,  there was little thought that this would also  bring about a huge amount of suffering for  our women. International tourism has  brought about sex trafficking of our women,  and what is really forced prostitution for  most women.  We do not believe women in our country have any choice when it comes to prostitution. Because of international tourism and  migration for work purposes, women have  wittingly and unwittingly become victims  of white slavery—victims of middle men  who entice our women to work in other  countries as domestic helpers. These women  end up being sexually and physically abused  by men.  During the war, when Iraq invaded  Kuwait, thousands of Filipina were detained  in Kuwait. Thousands of women are still  being detained. They could not come home.  Many of them remain there, imprisoned by  their employers, or imprisoned in areas  where they are considered persona non grata  [persons of no status] for, trying to escape  their employers or for wanting to leave Kuwait. Many of them have, in fact, left their  country without any legal passports.  When I was thinking of what I would  say about rethinking strategies to fight violence against women globally, I thought of  these things because it is clear [that while]  much work has actually been done, through  consciousness-raisingand education in communities, to stop battering and rape and  incest in our homes and in communities,  somehow it is not enough.  It frightened me to read, in a Newsweek  article, "the diaspora of Filipino women",  and to realise it was referring to Filipina  women all over the world as primarily domestic helpers and mail-order brides. Yet,  having been involved in the national liberation struggle in my country, I see this as part  of the victimization of women broughtabout  by our social, economic, and political situation.  This is where I would beg to seek your  solidarity and support for any Filipina you  see in your own country being maltreated  and abused as domestic helpers or who have  come to your country as mail-order brides  not knowing [what awaited them].  In the Philippines today, there are over  60,000 prostituted women. This has come  about as a result of the presence of the US  military bases. Military prostitution has increased the number of women suffering from  all sorts of abuses. And these have not  stopped even though the military bases are  no longer in our country now.  These same women are being brought  out of the country through Japan, via Europe, and are being sold as sex slaves in sex  farms in Europe. Many of these women  come back to our country with horror stories  of being sexually abused and brutally abused  by their employers, by the men who brought  them to these countries.  We are appealing to the women in the  'First World' to help us with this fight [to  combat sex trafficking] because many of us  do come across these women and yet we are  si lent. Let us not be part of the conspiracy of  silence and do something when we find  these Asian women in our communities,  isolated, not knowing where to go. And  that, I believe, is where we could start our  solidarity with each other.  Sunila Abeysekera has been working on  women's issues and organising women in Sri  Lanka since 1975. In the past year, she has been  focusing on issues of violence and women. She  also works with women who liave been displaced  as a result of the ongoing war in Sri Lanka, with  a group called Suriya Women's Development  Centre, and with groups of women from the  families of the "disappeared" in southern Sri  Lanka.  Sri Lanka has been in an ongoing civil  conflict for at least ten years. It's been an  increasingly militarized conflict and [Sri  Lanka has developed] an increasingly repressive State apparatus. The kind of violence I'm going to talk about is a generalised  violence in the whole society—a process of  militarisation, what's happening to women  within that process and what women have  been doing to fight back.  In the late 70s and early 80s, many women's groups in Sri Lanka working on violence against women focused on issues of  rape and incest and domestic violence. Since  the late 80s, the genera 1 situation in the country has deteriorated so rapidly that many  women's groups stopped talking about  women's issues. It has taken us a long time  to make the links between violence against  women and violence in society—to make the  links between the individual battering of a  woman in her home and the collective battering of women by a heavily militarized  and anti-democratic society and state structure.  In Sri Lanka, at the moment, the majority of women's groups are linking into a  struggle for human rights and democratic  freedom.   It's sometimes a hard choice to  make because, when you try to form coalitions and work with broad fronts, the fear is  that the way people—men, trade unionists,  for example, or men from the mainstream  political parties—try to address the issue of  violence and of how to fight back could  mean that the position of women in the  whole process becomes secondary.  What women in Sri Lanka have tried to  do is to work within all these broad fronts,  alliances and coalitions and to [set the priority] that the issue of violence against women  is crucial and critical to the whole struggle  for democracy and for human rights in our  country, and that support of women is critical for the struggle. We've been able to push  that forward becauseof the large numbers of  women who have been victims of violence in  our society.  Last year, at the meeting of the UN  Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Sri  Lanka was openly acknowledged to be the  country with the worst case of "disappearances" in the world. They estimate disappearances as something like 40,000 in a two-  year period. That's a lot of people [for] a  small country with a population of 16 million. "Disappeared" means that unidentified persons take away somebody and that  that somebody is never heard of again. The  assumption is usually that the person has  been killed.  Now, these 40,000 people [are] mostly  young men.. .and that means there are 40,000  women who are either mothers or wives of  the disappeared. That's a lot of women. I'm  talking about a phenomena which is only in  the very recent past.  As well, there are large numbers of  women who have been victims of violence  by being arrested, detained and/or raped.  And even larger numbers of women who  have been displaced from their villages and  their places of origin because of the war and  who have faced a lot of difficulties because  of the displacement.  So Sri Lanka is a very particular country  in that respect. There are probably about  one-and-a-half million women who can easily and directly be categorised as affected by  the generalised level of violence in society.  So because the numbers of women who  are victims of political violence is so high, it  has been possible to insist that women and  issues that concern women are right up there  on the agenda when one is talking about a  struggle to resist human rights violations  and a struggle to win democratic freedoms  for the Sri Lankan people.  The other thing that made it possible for  ustomake the links between violence against  individual women in society and the impact  of a generalised state of violence on women  is that, in the last five or six years, we've  experienced an increase in what the police  categorise as "domestic crime"—wife beating or crimes within the household. And  we've been really terrified by the ways in  which women are being killed, for example,  by their husbands or by their boyfriends. To  us, it indicates the extent to which the general process of militarization in society is  seeping through to the individuals who are  living in that society.  In a society where the State and its  apparatusmakesitalrighttouseforceandto  use violence to crush opposition and dissenting opinion, it also becomes alright for  an individual man to use the most brutal of  methods to crush the dissenting voice or  opposition within his household. It's been  terrifying to see the ways women are being  killed.  In Sri Lanka, when disappearances occurred, the most common form was that  people were killed and then burnt to prevent  identification. From 1987 to 1990 on, a common sight in any part of southern Sri Lanka  was the appearance of badly charred bodies  on the road side, to act a s a deterrent to others  who might step out of line.  Similarly, in the past year, we've recorded a large number of cases in which  husbands have killed their wives by burning  them. It's unlike some parts of northern  India, where the issue of dowry deaths, the  burning of women who don't bring enough  dowry home, has been something that  women have talked about and agitated  against for years. In Sri Lanka, the phenomena did not exist. The concept of burning  somebody alive is something that's very  new to us and that has been happening with  increasing regularity.  MMftl  m  "It has taken us a long  time to make the links  between violence  against women and  violence in society."  -Sunila Abeysekera  I mean, I'm 40 years old. When I was 20,  if somebody had told me it was allowed to  burn somebody to death, I would have said,  "no way!" But right now in my country,  there's an entire generation of children who  have seen that it's alright—people can burn  other people to death and nobody does anything about it.  What's truly frightening about violence  in society is that it breaks down the limits  and the barriers we set ourselves as human  beings—our respect and care for other human beings—and it makes anything possible. All experiences of repressive societies  [show that] de-humanizing and brutalizing  people gets to the point where anything  becomes permissable, any form of brutality,  any form of violence.  In the last two years, women in Sri  Lanka have strongly focused on, firstly, trying to make the links between women of all  communities. In Sri Lanka, the war is based  on two opposing ethnic identities—the  Singhalese and the Tamil. Women's groups  have consistently tried to make the links  between Tamil women and Singhali women  and Muslim women—at some level, the experience of violence is much the same, regardless of the community or group you  belong to. It has been a very positive and  empowering experience for us because it  has really been possible to make those links  between women, while making those links  with men, at the level of trade unions or  political parties, has been impossible.  And, secondly, we've also drivenhome  the point that when we talk about "no violence in society", that means "no violence in  the home"—that is, if you're against violence, you have to be against violence on  every sphere.  It's not worth it for us to only try to  address the issues of violence of individual  men against individual women if we're not  prepared at the same time to look at the  larger context in which the whole society is  based on violence, repression and coercion.

FEBRUARY 1993  11 Celebrating  Black Women's History  Mary Ann Shadd  February is Black History Month. In recognition of  a history of struggle and accomplishment, we pay tribute  to some of the women who make and hold the long line of  Black women fighters for justice and equality in Canada.  There are more women missing from these pages titan are  here. For example, the history of Black lesbians is only just  being uncovered. It is difficult to pull this information  together for many reasons, not least of which is the day-today struggle of dealing with a dominant culture. There are  too few books published on the contributes of Canadian  Black women to history, though much of this work is in  progress. What thisfeatu re does not say directly is that, on  the list or not, we honour all Black women in the everyday  struggle of life in Canada.  Marie Joseph Angelique: Enslaved in Lower  Canada, she ran away from a slave owner, burning  down 50 buildings in her wake in Montreal in 1733.  She was later recaptured, beaten, dragged through  the city and burned at the stake because of her bid for  freedom.  Harriet Tubman: This famous abolitionist escaped from slavery, returning time and again to lead  some three hundred of our enslaved ancestors to  freedom in Canada. She was known to threaten with  death anyone who gave up hope on the way to  freedom. Helping the cause of emancipation, she later served as a spy, a scout, a soldier  and a nurse, when war broke out between the north and the south. In Canada, she lived  in St. Catherine's, Ontario.  Mary Ann Shadd: Born a freedwoman in Delaware in 1823, she moved to Canada  in the early 1850's. A committed abolitionist, Shadd advocated for fugitives from slavery  to flee to Canada. Settling in Windsor and, later, in Toronto, she owned and edited the  newspaper, The Provincial Freeman from 1853 to 1857, promoting the anti-slavery  campaign. She also ran a small school in Windsor.  Annapolis Royal Rose Fortune: Born around 1774, she came to Annapolis Valley,  Nova Scotia with her parents as slaves of the Devonne family. She became a policewoman and 'baggagemasher' in Annapolis Royal around 1825.' Her descendants  founded the Lewis Transfer. In her day, she was to be found carting her transfer wagon  full of luggage and goods to and from the decks of ships along the wharf of that seaport  town.  Rosetta Amos Richardson: She was born in Toronto in 1857. Her mother and  grandmother had escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.

Tilly Mays: Founding member of the Coloured Woman's Club, she was born in  Montreal in the 1870's. The Coloured Woman's Club was a club formed around the turn  of the century when soldiers were returning home from the Boer War. The women of the  club worked with the poor, sick and injured in hospitals and soup kitchens.  Christina Jenkins: Co-publisher and editor, in 1923, of the London, Ontario  newspaper, The Dawn of Tomorrow. She was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1897. The  newspaper was the voice of Black people in Southern Ontario, like its forerunner, The  Provincial Freeman. At its peak in the 50s, it had a wide circulation, not only in Canada  but around the world. The paper is still published periodically by her descendants in  London, Ontario, where she lived for over 60 years. Jenkins was also mother to nine  children.  Carrie Best: A civil rights activist, journalist and commentator, she  was born in New Glasgow, Nova  Scotia in 1903. She wrote articles on  racial discrimination in Nova Scotia  and championed the cause of Black  rights. In 1949, her own newspaper,  The Negro Citizen began publishing  nationwide. Best is known all over the  country and in Black communities as  a strong fighting woman.  Viola Desmond: She was a Halifax beautician who, in 1947, attended  the Roseland theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, where the 'Jim  Crow' law required Blacks to sit upstairs in the balcony, while whites sat  in the main section. She bought a ticket  for upstairs, but there was no room.  She tried to pay the difference to sit  downstairs and was refused. She refused to leave the downstairs section  and was assaulted by a policeman  and the theatre's manager. She was arrested, charged with not paying the correct tax of  one cent, and jailed for 12 hours. She was later tried and convicted of defrauding the  federal government of one cent. Fighting back, Desmond took her case to the Supreme  Court, which eventually reversed the decision.  Violet Blackman: Born in Jamaica, she came to Canada in 1921. Now in her 80s,  Violet Blackman was a founding member of the Universal Negro (African) Improvement Association in Toronto in the early 30s.

The commit-  ;o tee raised funds and agitated for the struggle in South Africa  ■5 and mounted a demonstration when Nelson Mandela was  S first arrested. She was president of the committee for ten  i§ years. Another of her major contributions to Black history in  "2 Canada is that she founded the Library of Black Peoples'  ,2 Literature, now defunct, but which attempted, in the years of  7J its existence, to preserve the history of Black peoples.  £ Marie Hamilton: A teacher for 50 years in rural Nova  I Scotia, she is a member of the National Anti-Poverty Associa-  o tion. She taught school when there were no roads or  schoolrooms. Using her wit and wisdom, she made her way  through harsh racist times, firmly believing that education for  Black children would make a better world one day. Two years  ago, Hamilton recieved an honourary doctorate from Mount  St. Vincent University marking her great contribution to  education in Nova Scotia. She tutors at the North End Public  Library and is an active public speaker.  Pearleen Oliver: She was born and raised in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia. She is  a community leader and activist.

Her father, Howard Estes, bought  his family's freedom and they moved to California in 1851. Sylvia married Louis Stark. The  Starks and Estes families moved to Vancouver Island. In 1860, Sylvia Stark and her husband  came to Salt Spring Island, where they ran a farm for many years. They later moved to  Vancouver Island, near Nanaimo. When her husband died in 1895, Sylvia moved back to Salt  Spring Island, where she lived to be 105 years old. In her lifetime, she was known as "the  matriarch of Salt Spring Island." Her death brought to an end the era of the early Black  pioneers.  Nora Hendrix: She was born in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1883 and emigrated to  Vancouver in 1911. Hendrix was influential in the establishment of the first Black Church in  Vancouver-the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) on Jackson Ave. While her  political and social accomplishments might not be documented, her role in the making and  preservation of Black women's history and culture is invaluable. [See cover photo].  Rosa Pryor: Black women in Vancouver in the early to mid-1900's were famous for their  "Chicken Houses." These establishments provided a venue for Black people's social  activities in Vancouver at the time when a colour bar existed. Pryor was the proprietor of the  first Chicken House in Vancouver, which was located in Strathcona.  Vie: Another well-known establishment in Vancouver was Vie's Steak House. Vie was  a Victoria-born woman and one of the descendants of the Salt Spring Island Black settlers.

FEBRUARY 1993  FEBRUARY 1993  13 Feature  International Lesbian Week:  Big, bigger,  bigger yet  by Karen X. Tulchinsky  Why is International Lesbian Week different from all other weeks? "On all 51 other  weeks of the year lesbians work, organize  and spend time with gay men, heterosexual  people and bisexual people. This one week  of the year we set aside for ourselves," says  Mickey McCaffrey, a long time member of  the International Lesbian Week (ILW) Committee.  International Lesbian Week came to  Vancouver in 1986. Two local lesbians had  attended the International Lesbian and Gay  Association Conference in Geneva where  they learned that lesbians in Europe held a  week-long celebration just for themselves.  Enthused with the idea, they brought it back  to Vancouver, where lesbians have been organizing and celebrating the week ever since.  "Each year ILW is different. It all depends on which lesbians join the committee  and what events they want to organize,"  says McCaffrey. "That's what's exciting about  it. Each year you'll see different events. This  year's ILW is one of the biggest ever."  Some ILW events have been organized  several years in a row and others have been  one-time events only. Of the repeat events  that take place during ILW, perhaps one of  the most controversial is the Sexpertease  erotica show.  "There have been some women in the  pa st who have been offended by some of the  content of the show-but it's the most popular event. Tickets traditionally sell out within  a few days and there have been line-ups  around the block of women hoping to get in  at the last minute," says McCaffrey, who  organized the show two years ago.  "At first, no one stepped forward to put  on the show this year. The women who are  putting it on came on board because, they  said, "we couldn't imagine ILW without the  Sexpertease show." [See below for details!.  Fans are advised to buy their tickets in advance this year.  Another event that has become an important part of the annual ILWs is The Lesbian Visibility March, whichhasalso evolved  over the years.  "We used to specify that it was a march  for lesbians only, but a few years ago we  decided to open the march to everyone who  supports lesbian rights," says Mary Brookes,  organizer of this year's Dykes on the Drive  march.  Mary is also one of the planners for the  Butch/Femme panel which takes place at  the Holiday Inn on February 25. "It's the  long-awaited debate," says Brookes. "We've  all been talking about it, with our friends  anyway. One of the reasons we're having the  panel is to look at the changes that have  happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s  that will allow the discussion to happen in a  way that was impossible in the 1970s lesbian  community."  Although the panel members all identify as either butch or femme, Brookes says it  is not necessary for audience members to do  so. "All lesbians are welcome," she says,  "Dykes on the Drive" 1992  "but this is not the place to criticize the  existence of butch and femme lesbians.  "The women on the panel and those in  the audience who speak out are vulnerable,  and we want the atmosphere to be safe for  everyone. We need to be respectful to our  butches and femmes. They, like drag queens,  have taken the flack, have been on the front  lines challenging heterosexual society in  ways that have created positive change for  all lesbians."  Karen X.

Across from her sits a ruddy-faced  white man, his television voice rumbling  something about...was it "reverse racism"?  Realizing they are unaware of me, I find  myself a seat in the next room. Her voice  comes through the wall, clear and strong.  "That is a very patronising attitude, held by  a lot of men in power in this country. I have  no patience with it." If there had been a door  to slam...  I look at the blurb on Ladha on the flyers  put out by the Vancouver-based South Asian  organization, Rungh Cultural Society, announcing that she will be reading on January  17 at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. It  says she spent her childhood in Tanzania  and emigrated to Canada in 1978, and that  she is currently completing a master's degree in English at the University of Calgary.  She has been featured in numerous periodicals and anthologies and has had two books  published: Bridle Hands on the Maple, and  Lion's Granddaughter and Other Stories. I'm  looking forward to meeting her.  Readerji  Larissa Lai: When I read your books, one  thing that struck me right away was how  you attempt to establish a relationship with  the reader. Could you talk a little about that?  Yasmin LadhaA want writing to be a part  of everything, which is an Eastern concept.  Writingisa romancel can't haveon my own.  When we were growing up, they would say,  "oh, once there was a king and then there  was a queen..." and then the king would  suddenly start speaking out of the text, or the  reader suddenly comes through, orthe writer  suddenly comes through and says, "hey  reader, watch me doing this." It's a very old  concept and very much an oral thing.  Stories aren't linear as they are in the  European academic tradition. You just go all  over the place—and I need my Readerji to be  with me, and to participate throughout.  When I call you "Readerji", then already  you're with me,and you say, well,Ihave this  disbelief and I don't agree with you, but  already we're in a relationship, and you're  named in my story.  Romance  Heer and Ranjha were in love, so the  South Asian legend goes. Their families did  not approve of the union. Through a series of  fateful events, they lost each other.  "Your work is so muchabout romance,"  I say to Ladha. "Tell me more about Heer  and Ranjha."  Ladha: I never stick to stories. I always  tell my own out of them anyway. [Mine is] a  very folkish interpretation, and, I think, a  very heady interpretation. I get really ticked  off when there is only Romeo and Juliet...It  bothers me. There is a whole horde of literature [that exists outside of that]...I just want  to push and say, I want to have my people  here too.  Lai: Yes, coming from the English Lit.  tradition, we have only Shakespeare. Excuse  me, Mr. Shakespeare, but where did you get  that story, who did you steal that from?  These stories travel by word of mouth across  vast distances.  Ladha: I think these stories are circular.  They're like nomads. But I'm only allowed  to live with a certain story, like Romeo and  Juliet. I could have Heer and Ranjha in my  home, but I can't bring them to my public  life. As a woman writer, I want to make sure  that my private is my public and my public  is my private, because the act of writing for  me is not a studious type of thing.  Lai: I see what you mean about stories  being circular. In your stories, there are  echoes of "Heer and Ranjha." There are  often characters who are in lovebut can't get  together because of differences in race, class  or ideology.  Ladlia: Yes, the story is very powerful.  Asian/African tensions, love-affairs  In The Lion's Granddaughter, there's a  story set in Tanzania called "Aisha." The  main character, Aisha is the daughter of a  South Asian woman (who has run away to  the city) and an African man (who ran away  shortly after Aisha's conception). She lives  with her grandmother and Juma, an African  man who lives with the family, perhaps as a  closely trusted servant, or as an adopted  son. Although he is loved and trusted, he is  also constantly "kept in his place."  Juma is in love with a South Asian  woman, and has collected nearly enough to  pay the bride price. The grandmother refuses  to allow the marriage to take place. Her  beliefs about African male sexuality come  from her experience with Aisha's mother,  and are automatically generalized to include all African men, even someone as  closely trusted as Juma. Our sympathies lie  with Juma.  In another story, the daughter of the  house has a crush on an African boy. The  grandmother snubs the boy and, in retribution, Juma sexually assaults the daughter.  The way in which power shifts back and  forth between race and gender never allows  our sympathies to rest in one place for long.  Yasmin talks about layers of truth in  stories. She describes her work as manifesting various truths without necessarily being  able or desiring to resolve them.  Ladha: If there's a Larissa in one story,  she may come up in other stories but she's  not the same person, [although] she's the  same woman. She has the same purple scarf.  We're all like that, different human beings at  different times. It's not linear.  Lai: There's a tension between South  Asian women and African men in a number  of these stories.  Ladha: I don't want to be harsh toward  my own people, but I think South Asians in  Africa were a very self-contained community. Is that why we had problems? There is  always that sense of "what is refused to you  is interesting" —not in the white sense [of  exotification], but in the sense of belonging  completely to Tanzania. If you're a woman,  then you would marry an African man.  This is looking at it very idealistically.  Like one of the "nuttier" characters, Aisha's  mother. She just doesn't care about anything  else, just giddily wanting to be loved.  Tohavea passionate love affair with the  country.  For me, these stories of mixed-race people express what it means to want to belong,  crazily. I'm critical of how South Asian people were self-contained completely—so  much so that we lost [our chance to belong  to] the land.  We put mixed-race people through a lot  of shame and indignity. I remember, for  example. [I was living in a hostel] at that  time. [The singer] James Brown was popular, and the [mixed-race] girls would become the best dancers—they would become  best at what they were permitted to be best  at, and we would say, "well, after all, it's the  African blood." That's what we'd say to  each other. Yet when we would go to school,  we'd each be in love with someone who was  African. There's a lot of contradictions.  I'm bringing all these things to the surface. One story is not enough. You need two  or three stories to let things move.  Lai: To play out the possibilities?  Ladha: I like to let a lot of other stories  come through rather than to say here is the  mainstream story, and all half-caste problems are related to this. There are ways you  can go about it. It's like when you come here  and they say, "why is it that you want to  emigrate?" There is not one answer. There  are a thousand. Yet you have to give only  one.  Lai: So that you're laying open all these  things, not necessarily ordering them, or  placing them in a hierarchy.  Ladha: Yes, who am I to do that?  India  Lai: I wanted to ask you what kind of  relationship you have with India.  Ladha: I didn't want to go back to Tanzania once we had left. I've never been back. It  just hurt me terribly. I didn't know I had this  anger in me until I grew up. Then I realized,  I don't want to go to Africa. But 1 needed a  home because, at that time, Canada was not  enough. I thought I'd like to go to India. My  mother is a very strong Indian woman...I  had the privilege of staying with the teacher  who had influenced her in her childhood.  So this time, the daughter goes back to  learn Indian culture. It was a romance. Then  I became more serious about India. After I  felt satisfied I was no longer hungry for a  homeland, I came back to Canada, and began to love Canada with a different force.  Heating the Heart of the Matter  Lai: In the last pages of Lion's Grand-  | daughter you ask whether the dichotomy  - between the colonizer and the colonized is  ! inevitable, and then you propose this idea of  L "pushing friction into fiction." What do you  mean by that?  Ladha: There's a certain established way  of writing [in the West] and I'm married to  this culture. But I don't mean married in a  bad way, because I'm having a jolly good  time. I call Western culture, Shakespeare  and so on, "Husbandji." How do I get around  it [to reflect my reality]? By "waffling with  Yasmin Ladha  cunning." For instance, I want Heer and  Ranjha, Husbandji wants Romeo and Juliet.  I say "yes, Husbandji, of course, if you say  so." But I lead my own existence underneath. I think that's a process that has to  occur until Husbandji says "OK, I understand where you're coming from."  When my grandmother wanted to tell  my grandfather something, she would never  state the point directly. She would go all  around it to get him to agree. That may be  considered conniving, cheating but I don't  think so from my cultural point of view.  What she was doing was "heating" the  story...heating towards the matter.  In my stories I do the same thing—in  stories later in the book, [Husbandji and I]  can negotiate as partners. But until this happens, I just waffle in cunning.

FEBRUARY 1993  KINESIS Arts  A world of struggle:  A glimpse of freedom  by Manisha Singh   Social, political and cultural activist and  writer Himani Bannerji came to Vancouver  from Toronto in mid-January to read her  works a longside other writers of colour. The  readings, sponsored by the Rungh Cultural  Society and TSAR Publications, took place  over two evenings at Octopus Books and the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre.  Himani Bannerji was born in India in  1942 and came to Canada in 1969. She currently teaches social sciences at York University, Toronto. I had the chance to interview  her during her brief stay in Vancouver. It  was with some nervousness that I approached this woman, whose work has always spoken volumes to me. We had quite  an amazing time, conversing over greasy  scrambled eggs and coffee and later lying on  her bed chatting, while she smoked cigarettes.  Singh: What brought you to Canada, to  Toronto, to anti-racist politics?  I was in the middle of a marriage that  didn't make any sense. So I decided to go to  Canada. 1 had planned to take my daughter  "I wrote in buses, in  coffee shops, in  doughnut shops, on the  back of cigarette boxes  and whatever pieces of  paper I happened to  have handy."  with me but Immigration told me I couldn't  because I didn't earn enough.  I came to Canada, on my own. It was  one of the hardest things I have ever done in  my life. It was like jumping into a darkness,  like falling through space. I am still falling  through it in some fashion.  I showed up one day in Toronto not  knowing anybody! was totally heartbroken  about my child. I felt very guilty—just very  lost and sad about her. I felt I had done  something really wrong, you know crazy,  selfish. In Canada, I discovered they wouldn't  accept my MA degree, that I had to repeat it.  I hated the university. People were so cold.  I didn't know in the beginning how to  name what was happening to me. I didn't  know why people were treating me like this  or what was going on. After six or seven  months, I figured it out—1 learned that great  word "racism."  One day I wept with Kate Coburn, the  women with whom I was working. I told her  I'd left my baby behind, that I hated being  here and that I lived in this rooming house  where these men kept showing me gross  pictures of women. She was appalled. She  arranged for the English Department to make  me a lecturer. Finally, I had the money to  bring my daughter to Toronto.  My consciousness about race and racism increased by experience and by identifying with other people. But in Toronto at that  time, there wasn't much happening in terms  of anti-racism work. Nobody named it. It is  interesting now to speculate as to why there  wasn't a race consciousness given that the  USwasonlyafewmilesaway.MartinLuther  King Jr. was already dead. Malcom X had  been shot. The American Indian Movement  had been shot tosmithereensbytheUSarmy  at Wounded Knee. And in Toronto, [racism]  wasn't being talked about.  It didn't become a named issue until the  mid-70s. We were among some of the earliest people, particularly among women, who  named it.  I've worked quite a lot in solidarity  organizations. It is in the context of understanding imperialism that I understood racism, and connected what was happening to  me everyday in Canada with the "larger"  issues. I don't see where "the large" ends,  because I felt like every "large" is made of  little "smalls." To this day, it is my conviction that people who do anti-racism work  lose when they lose sight of that.  Singh: What brought you to feminism?  Bannerji: I am sure I was a feminist way  before I knew the word. But for those of us  who didn't have the language of women's  specific oppression, the language we used as  young women was social justice. A consistently unjust treatment of half of humanity is  a massive political issue.  The thing I knew is that no man was  ever going to tell me how to live my life. No  man was going to feed me and clothe me and  house me. I didn't know what name to give  this.  When I came to Toronto and I was  feeling very sad and very broken, I turned to  other women. I discovered a whole slew of  single women who were going through similar things. It is by talking with them that I  discovered the existence of somethingname-  able—feminist politics.  Singh: What is your relationship to your  writing? Why do you write?  Bannerji: When I came to Canada, I use  to write for myself. I didn't know it was  poetry. I just wrote something, partly because I needed to express something, and  partly because I felt that writing would help  me understand my life. So it was both an  expression and an exploration of myself.  Every once in awhile I wrote in buses, in  coffee shops, in doughnut shops mostly, on  the back of cigarette boxes and whatever  pieces of paper I happened to have handy. I  lost a lot of my pieces.  All those turmoils took the shape of a  few lines here and there. I didn't know what  I could call them. I didn't call them poetry.  Then when solidarity organizations had rallies, such as African Liberation Day or a day  for Chile, the organisers would ask us to  read. And we would show up—me, Dionne  Brand, and Krisantha Sri Bhaggiyadatta.  I write and there it is—once it's there,  I'm no longer there. I certainly don't sit there  contemplating myself as a poet with a capital "P". When a poet is not writing poetry, is  she a poet? Does it mean anything to have  these kinds of professionalized tags attached  on to me?  Singh: How do you feel about the recent  commodification by women of colour's poetry by mainstream culture?  Bannerji: I have never sent a manuscript  to anybody. People have collected my pieces  of paper, and done all the work of typing  and putting it all together. I don't politically  agree with the relationship between writers,  and businessmen or women that I see now,  with the kind of hustling that has to be done  for the patronage of the state.  I know the state owes us and I agree  theoretically. Yet, I still don't think the state  should be the source whose funding or lack  of funding determines what we do politically as organizers and writers. Politics has  become a matter of selling and packaging. I  don't know that' its healthy. Sometimes I  think we have this outside observer in our  minds when we are writing, because wonder to whether or not our work is fundable.  Singh: What is the relationship between  language, (both English and Bengali) and  your poetry?  Bannerji: I've lived here for the last 20  years. If I don't hear a language as a speech  rhythm, I don't think I know how to use it. I  don't speak Bengali most of the time here. If  I were to write in Bengali now, I would have  to imagine an audience that doesn't live with  me. I would have to imagine issues that are  there, not here. I would have to create an  India that I can't.  The other thing is that I would hate to  sell India. It's like selling my mother. To this  day,I feel reluctant to speak about my mother  in English. My mother was a deeply vernacular person, never knew any English, not  a word. To transform this woman and my  experience with her in English is a very  problematic task.  Himani Bannerji  Also, I don't like the way people peddle  ethnicities and cultures of their countries.  Every line has to be accompanied by a glossary and a translation. By then, it is anthropology. How am I to convey experiences  which did not happen to me in English?  Language is not neutral. How am I going to  sit there footnoting my mother?  Singh: Many of us are writing about the  effects of racism on our lives. On the one  hand, there is constant pressure to write  about external domination. Do you feel internal pressure to write only about racism  and sexism? Do you ever find yourself personally trapped, or confined to writing about  racism? Have we sort of become theme writers?  Bannerji: Yes, it is a problem. The problem of racism is so heavy and hard on us that  in some sense it feels almost a crime not to  talk about it. Then again, there are other  things that are happening to me which don't  have to do with racism.  For a long time, I felt like I was kind of  stuck. My own personal conscience doesn't  allow me to move away from racism. Unconsciously, for me, there is a priority. What  do you have to attend to first? How important is it for me talk about my personal  losses?  Singh: But as you say in your poem,  Doing Time, it is a privilege to have a personal life and to write about this personal  life.  Bannerji: Yes, it's a privilege. But, at the  same time, it is a necessity too. This is where  domination has effectively got us in its grip.  It really has preorganized the agenda, and  not because we write to order, but the pain is  so great in its social and personal magnitude  that you end up continually writing about it.  I don't know what my comrades would  say if I were to say to them, I just want to  write about a tree. I would love to write  about that tree, as some people seem to have  the privilege to do.  I have felt much hemmed in by this.  Externally, people say, "tell us about racism." On the other hand, by my own standards, it's strange I should want to write  about a tree.  Singh: Do you feel that a whole part of  you remains unwritten?  Bannerji: In the end, I think I have made  my peace and realize, if I can't talk about  one,[the tree] I can't talk about the  other[racism]. The world is larger than my  little corner, and it is larger than only pain. I  think I have freed myself.  "I don't know what my  comrades would say if I  were to say to them, I  just want to write about  a tree."  Singh: In her introduction to The Geography of Voice: Canadian Literature of the South  Asian Diaspora, Dianne McGifford writes:  "more important is the question of when  Canada will recognize these writers as genuine A-one, honest-to-goodness Canadian,  rather than consider them exotic cultural  embellishments or imitations, albeit colourful ones, of the real thing."  I don't believe that patriarchy and racism can be challenged by competing with  white male-stream Canadian writers on existing terms within existinghierarchies. How  do you feel about these so called Canadian  literary standards?  Bannerji: It's a dialogue they have with  each other. She is telling it to white readers,  not to me. My authenticity is not dependent  on her acceptance of me as authentic so that  line doesn't speak to me. I am, whether they  like it or not. I will write what I feel like  writing about and whether they feel it speaks  to them is their battle. I won't fight it for  them.  Whether I am a Canadian writer or not  is not my concern either. I am a writer with  a certain history and a certain experience. I  write what I know about and what I feel.  Where it belongs; what kind of category they  have to put it into; where, in their canon of  literature, this falls in; these are their headaches.  Singh: There are obviously no simple  political strategies for change. In your poem,  Doing Time, a prison, by definition, is a place  from which there is either no escape, or few  chances to escape. How do you envision  breaking these barriers?  Bannerji: The last line of the poem says,  "I have become so many people," and I think  that is my escape. Prisons become converted  into liberation struggle when you discover  your fellow prisoners. If I have discovered  my comrades, then I have transformed this  closed space into a world of struggle. The  possibility of change lies in recognizing that  a prison is created, that I am stuck there. The  transformation can only happen by joining  forces with others in the same prison. What  shape this will take, I don't know.  Periodically in these solidarities, we see  glimpses of that freedom, where we begin to  see that the construction of this prison is  based on coercion and consent. When we  can fight the coercion and delegitimize the  consent, we have created a space, which is a  tiny glimpse of how large freedom can be.  Manisha Singh is a writer for Kinesis.  FEBRUARY 1993 Arts  Book review:  What is the Mat[t]er  by Nancy Goldhar   NOTHING MAT[T]ERS  A Feminist Critique of Postmodernism  By Somer Brodribb  Toronto: James Lorimer & Co., 1992  How do I know I exist? How is the mind  structured?  These were to be my institutionally sanctioned philosophical preoccupations during  undergraduateand graduate universitystud-  Oh! I think, therefore I am. Oh! The  mind is structured like a language.  So those are the answers.  Even if those had been pressing questions or satisfactory answers, I could never  do as requested in essays or exams—to critique and problematize the likes of Descartes  or Lacan—since another personal philosophical question continually reverberated  in my brain: Who Do You ThinkYou Are? (also  the title of a novel by Alice Munro) discussing any of this anyway.  Curiously, this proverbial philosophical problem posed by and plaguing many  women never appears in undergraduate  philosophy departments nor in graduate  English departments. Their philosophical  problems never troubled me and mine never  troubled them. We were concerned about  different matters.  Their philosophical  problems never troubled  me and mine never  troubled them.  What matters? And to whom?  This is what Somer Brodribb investigates in Nothing Mat[t]ers, her critique of the  crush some feminists have on mainstream/  "male-stream"(xxii) theories of post-modernism which presently dominate contemporary theorizing in the academy.  What matters in Nothing Mat[t[ers? Revitalizing theory within the academy.  And to whom?  Those already schooled in recent academic theory.  Brodribb performs the rigorous task of  revealing the central male misogynist principles from which postmodernism originates  and continues to perpetuate. Thus, those  academically acclaimed feminists such as  Chris Weedon, Jane Flax, Alice Jardine, Linda  Nicholson,ElizabethMeese,SusanHekman,  and Nancy Fraser, to name a few, who by  privileging the philosophical macho reper-  toireof Nietzsche, Levi-Strauss, Sartre, Freud,  Lacan, Althusser, Foucault, Barthes, Derrida  and Co., are not performing the much-needed  feminist critique of, or intervention in, the  historically male-dominated institutions/  universities.  These feminists, as Brodribb asserts,  have a "position of compromise within institutions and a form of quietism [which] hides  the abusiveness of the ideology to which it  reconciles itself and others."  Furthermore, it makes it near impossible for radically alternative women's voices  to be heard amidst the calamitous clamour  of "Foucault's power, Sartre's nothingness,  Levi-Strauss' end to the world, Lacan's fatal  desire, Derrida's wizardry, Sade's creation  through murder, and Nietzsche's eternal  return to the masculine o/One."  In contrast to the experience-based approach to consciousness, postmodern theorists put forward the following conditions of  consciousness as more compelling: the mind /  body public/private subject/object theory/  experience split; the physicalbody in absentia  always-already representational; the creation of all things ex nihilo—"The Word creates everything out of nothing. Matter does  events in male theory which has not resulted  in their theoretical significance being threatened: Marx and dialectical materialism  focus on consumption; Freud and  psychoanalysis rely on sexuality; death figures for Sartre and existentialism; and Lacan  claims biological basis for his concept of the  mirror stage.  In analytic speak, "postmodernism is  patriarchal ideology." In lyrical speak,  postmodernism is the "politics of patriarchal ecstasy."  m&*^ m  Somer Brodribb  not make matter. Everything rests upon the  absolute and ineffable word. Only words  matter. Nothing matters." Violence, death  and nothingness matter deeply to the forefathers, not matter/ mater/ mother/ material/ matrix—Nothing Mat[t]ers.  Brodribb argues that "postmodernism  exults female oblivion and disconnection; it  has no model for the aquisition of knowledge, for making connections, for communication, or for becoming global, which feminism has done and will continue to do."  Furthermore, she defends subjective  female experience as a legitimate way of  knowing, whereby the mind and body coordinate theory and research.  In defence, she points to Mary O'Brien's  explanation of the reliance on key biological  Brodribb speaks in both tongues, clearing the verbal path so that women such as  Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, bell hooks,  Mary Daly, Mary O'Brien, Sarah Ruddick,  Barbara Christian, Daphne Marlatt, Betsy  Warland, to name a few, and others who as  yet remain publicly unnamed, can continue  to "overcome our collective aphasia and our  amnesia [loss of language and memory] to  speak our minds and live our times."  These matters of lofty theoretics do affect the individual life—had Brodribb and  others like her predominated in my university days (1981-present), I might not be the  academic casualty that I am fast becoming.  You see, I still seem to be on about other  mat[t]ers than those of concern to the academy.  After submitting my outline for a doctoral dissertation on Canadian women's life-  writing to an English department at an  American university, theoretically entrenched in matters of postmodernism/  poststructuralism/deconstruction, I was  advised by a female feminist professor to  better pit myself in the mainstream academic conversation (read:"ragpick in the  bins of male ideas," —Somer Brodribb) and  was admonished by her observation that I  was in a room alone writing (read:  "knowledge that considers female experi-  In analytic speak,  "postmodernism is  patriarchal ideology."  In lyrical speak,  postmodernism is the  "politics of patriarchal  ecstasy."  This was my first encounter with a professor's feminist inferiority and seduction  by the male academy. So began my "feminist coming of rage." Hadn't I been urged by  our feminist foremother, Virginia Woolf in  A Room of One's Own, to: acquire a room of  my own in which to have "the habit of  freedom and the courage to write exactly  what we think...and then the opportunity  will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare's sister will put on the body which  she has so often laid down" and construct a  sentence that better fits my sex: "woman  must make for herself, altering and adapting  the current sentence until she writes one that  takes the natural shape of her thought without crushing or distorting it" (from Women  and Writing)? And by Adrienne Rich to think  like a woman, which " means remembering  that every mind resides in a body; remaining  accountable to the female bodies in which  we live" (On Lies, Secrets, and Silences)?  Brodribb acknowledges the consequences, lack of support, and exorbitant  costs personally, politically, and economically for those who risk 'radical feminist  work' (read: "women who try to use  unprocessed ingredients in their recipes in  order to avoid preserving masculine categories and implications are punished").  While readingNothingMat[t]ers, I had a  dream: apparently pregnant, I found myself  suddenly in labour with only my youngest  sister there toassist,butnothingwould come.  I awoke to a deep sense of intellectual constipation, having spent so much time reading  the passages of dry hardened male theory  which Brodribb digs into, and bearing a  frustration of an empty womb of my own,  born of too lengthy a gestation period with  no academic progeny to show for it.  I am trying to push harder, grateful for  her labour,and will follow Somer Brodribb's  exhortation: to "remember what matters"  and write my way toward a feminist project  "that is not filtered through or returned to a  masculine paradigm, but expressed creatively and symbolically by a subject that is  female."

FEBRUARY 1993 Arts  Review: Videos by Sadie Benning:  A Fisher-Price artist  by Kathleen Oliver  THE WORKS OF SADIE BENNING  Presented by Video In/Out on Screen,  at the Video In, Vancouver  November 1992  At the age of 20, American video artist  Sadie Benning has already had a solo exhibit  at New York's Museum of Modern Art, and  "retrospectives" of her work have been presented at various lesbian and gay film festivals worldwide.  Benning was recently in Vancouver to  present a selection of her works at Video In,  and it was easy to see why Benning's work  has been attracting so much attention.  Benning's videos are, for the most part,  short, intensely personal explorations of  various issues. The earliest works (made  when Benning was 15) take stabs at social  commentary that are sometimes too broad  to be effective. For example: "My neighbour  is selling crack as my neighbourhood dies.  But our nation is addicted to a more harmful  drug: money." It's true, but what does she  mean? It lacks depth.  It is when Benning's works begin to  grapple with more personal issues, such as  her lesbian identity, that they become more  interesting. In // Every Girl Had a Diary,  Benning longs for a world in which "People  could look at me and say, 'that's a dyke'—  and if they didn't like it, they'd fall into the  centre of the earth and deal with them-  From/f Wasn't Love  selves." The narration accompanies tremendously expressive images of simple things—  a comb, a cat, a hand twisting around in  high-contrast lighting.  All of Benning's work shares the same  arresting visual quality, a result of her on-  the-cheap production methods. Benning  shoots her videos with a Fisher-Price video  camera, originally designed to record im-  r^^H  ;■•           ■,...

(Blizzard Publishing, Winnipeg 1992)  In It Every Girl Had a  Diary, Benning longs for  a world in which  "People could look at  me and say, 'that's a  dyke'—and if they didn't  like it, they'd fall into the  centre of the earth and  deal with themselves."  ages onto ordinary audiocassette tapes.  Conceived as a child's toy, the camera is no  longer available, a fact Benning wryly attributes to a perceived threat on the part of  video camera manufacturers.  The images captured are gritty, grainy,  and ultimately otherworldly. The simplest  image—a close-up of an eye, for instance (a  prominent feature in Benning's earlier videos)—takes on supernaturally expressive  qualities.  Benning has upgraded to somewhat  more sophisticated production techniques  for her recent videos, though she is still using  theFisher-Pricecamera./o/Zfes isa marvelous  celebrationof lesbian self-recognition, evoking those wonderful girl-girl crushes of childhood, along with things like Barbie dolls,  Mr. Bubbles, and other trappings of an  American childhood in the 70s.  Benning also has a flair for incorporating text into her videos in intriguing ways.  In some of the earliest videos, the camera  pans along a line of text written on paper; in  Jollies, a sentence is strung together from  dollar bills, each with one word written on it,  that are unfolded in sequence for the camera.  Along with Jollies, the most accomplished video screened at Video In was It  Wasn't Love, a wonderfully dry take on film  noir (those broody, atmospheric films of the  VANCOUVER  WOMEN'S  BOOKSTORE  Monday-Saturday  10:00 am-6:00 pm  315 Cambie Street Vancouver, BC  V6B 2N4 (604)684-0523  40s), road movies, and the whole idea of  glamour. The video boasts a terrific soundtrack featuring sound bites of everyone from  Bessie Smith to Jimi Hendrix, Screamin' Jay  Hawkins, the Steve Miller Band, and Tommy  James and the Shondells. It makes the 70s  sound good! The video also features some  great down-and-out lines, like: "She said:  'Go ahead. Fall in love with me. What else  do you have to do?' "  On the whole, Benning's videos are far  more about young urban attitude than they  are about politics. That Benning is a child of  the Video Generation is amply evident in the  generally superficial quality of her work,  including an ambiguous position on race  issues. The videos are far more about how  they look than about anything else.  Her stance may also have something to  do with the wider audience her work has  found. As Benning said in the discussion  period following the screenings, her original  work was very honest because she had no  audience; now, "there's more to deal with."  Which gives an extra resonance to the  closing line of one of her early videos, If  Every Girl Had a Diary: "I guess to be alone is  to know yourself for you and not for who  you're with, and I like that."  Just how Benning will reconcile that  insight with her new-found fame remains to  be seen: she is currently in the early stages of  work on a feature film entitled Girlpower.  That dykeness includes a certain kind of  power is one theme that runs throughout  Benning's work, be it the power to provoke  with canny images or the power to claim our  space in a world that wants to pretend we  don't exist. The continued emergence of  Benning's powers as an artist will be interesting to watch.  Kathleen Oliver is a regular Kinesis Arts  contributor.  Watch for  Black History Month  and Valentine Day  Specials  1988 West 4th & Maple  Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 (604)733-3511  FEBRUARY 1993 Letters  dear     reader  Kinesis loves receiving mail. Please  get your letter to us by the 18th of the  month.  If you can, keep the length to about  500 words.  (If you go way over, we  might edit for space.)  Hope to hear from you very soon.  Love,  Kinesis  Boon to  the soul  Shattering  the mood  Kinesis:  I have two reasons for asking Kinesis to  print the following letter I sent to the director  of the Vancouver International Film Festival  (VIFF) last October. I'd like to share this  letter with other wimmin who had the kind  of experience I did at the first showing of the  film Forbidden Love at the VIFF in October,  1992.1 am also hoping it will reach wimmin  who were in that audience that felt their  right to view Claire Et L'Obscurite, the short  film on violence against women preceding  Forbidden Love, had been violated.  To Alan Franey, VIFF director:  I'm writing this letter in response to  attending the second showing of Forbidden  Love and hearing an announcement that the  chaos at the previous showing during the  short film Claire Et L'Obscurite was being  described as being due to opposing political  views within the audience.  I am astonished and aghast at such an  interpretation. Wimmin were not storming  out of the theatre and crying in the lobby  because of their political views. Perhaps the  following will make my point clearer.  It was going to be a wonderful evening.  The film was called Forbidden Love. It was  about lesbians. I am a lesbian. It is seldom  there is a opportunity to experience myself  whole and complete out there in the  homophobic outside world. So seldom do I  get to see myself on a movie screen or on a  stage. So seldom do I hear my own voice on  the radio. Yes, tonight would be wonderful.  There we would be on the big screen.  Wimmin I recognized. Wimmin whose experience I share as a lebian. An opportunity  to be in the world as a lesbian. To have my  pain validated. To laugh at myself. An opportunity to celebrate who I am.  But then I saw a man smash a womon's  face. I felt my body wrench involuntarily. I  witnessed wimmin disappearing. The message was very clear. I saw a man's hand  brutally attack a womon's breast. I felt the  pain of the invasion explode in my body.  I dropped my eyes so I could no longer  see the screen. I stood up and walked out  into the lobby. A moment later, another  womon came crashing through the door.  Out. Into the lobby. The blood had drained  from her face. "What the hell is going on?"  she demanded of the air around her. I recognized her torment. There were others filing  out behind her. Some were in a rage. Some  were dazed. Some were in tears as their  friends helped them out of the theatre.  So much for the celebration. I had come  to revel in a film about who I was. Without  my permission and without warning, I was  subjected to powerful imagery of wimmin  being violated. The emotions that erupted  within me were not new to me. I had experienced them before. I had been assaulted.  In case you still don't get it, the wimmin  in that theatre had come out to celebrate their  lives. What a lot of us got was to be dragged  into a sea of pain and assaults.  Sincerely,  Sandra Lynne James,  Vancouver, BC  Kinesis:  I wanted to write and tell you how  wonderful I found the latest issue of Kinesis  [see Kinesis, Dec/Jan. 93]. It is indeed a boon  to my soul and, as a rural woman, I need to  stay in touch with what's going on. Although I read one of the Vancouver dailies,  it never gives me the inside scoop that you  do.  I especially like your "Movement Matters" and "What's News" pages with short,  to-the-point reports on a lot of different  issues.  The piece on Audre Lorde was wonderful and I wondered if you would mind if I  copied the request for donations to the Audre  Lorde Memorial Fund in Herspectives?  I was a little disappointed in the report  on the Women of the 90's—From Backlash to  Empowerment conference and would like  to suggest in future perhaps, the women  who attend as reporters could do a report of  the conference and then, if they wish to, do  a separate one about their personal experience of it. That is not to say that Ididn't enjoy  the piece they did do on it. Au contraire, my  dears.  Somehow I feel that the wonderful new  column on the history of the women's movement [see Kinesis, Dec/Jan. 93] is a direct  result of that conference. But I would once  more make a plea that the women's movement of the late 60s and early 70s (or even  before that) didn't only happen in Vancouver.  I lived in Abbotsford and it was a small  town back then, and I attended one of the  first consciousness-raising groups. I often  drove up to Aldergrove to the very first old  house that preceded the Ishtar Transition  house. At first, it was a women's centre wi th  room upstairs for women who needed shelter. The stairs were ones thathad to be pulled  down on a rope and climbed up, and then  pulled back up. It was a real dump but it was  wonderful.  At the open house, many people came  to see what this women's movement was all  about, including some of the Mennonite community from around that area. One woman  nearly had a stroke when she went into the  bathroom and when she got nicely sat on the  throne and looked straight ahead of her, the  poster on the door said in big letters, "All  any woman needs is a good Fuck!" which of  course was what men were saying about all  of us who were fighting for our liberation  back then. The poster was a parody of that  sentiment (sic), of course, but it was a real  shock for many women to see it in print,  never mind a religious person who pretended there was no such word and, if there  was, it was only said by the grossest and  most sinful of men. And there it was right in  our own washroom! There wasn't a woman  living with whom it didn't resonate. We'd  heard that said as a cure-all for everything  about women all our lives, and there wasn't  a one of us who could deny it. Talk about  breaking the silence!  It was a wonderful, magical time. I went  to a weekend Gestalt workshop there for all  women and it changed my life forever. That  was in 1970,1 believe.  I desperately need to hear more, more,  more about those times. I was going through  such upheaval in my personal and political  life that it was all I could do to pay attention  to my own life, so I know very little of what  went on in Vancouver or elsewhere in the  province and of course there was nothing in  the papers.  You will do all of us who were there a  great service if you fill in some of the blanks  for us. It only improves and deepens the  experience of this old workhorse in the women's movement and I once more applaud  and congratulate you as you continue to  change with it.  A million thanks to each and every  woman who has worked on Kinesis this past  year. You will never know what effect it has  on some of us labouring a bit further afield.  And please don't forget to include us in your  plans and especially in announcements of  things that happen. I know it's hard if you  don't get the information in time, but many  times things have either already happened  or there isn't sufficient time to enable women  from outside the city to attend. This is not a  criticism, only a reminder. Many of us are  poor too, and must plan ahead for ticket  expenses, gas, parking, babysitting, meals,  etc., even for one day in the city.  Once more, m y sincere thanks and blessings on all your beautiful heads.  Sincerely,  Mary Billy  Editor, Herspectives  Squamish, BC  A catholic-  protestant dialogue  Kinesis:  I read with interest the article  "Unlearning Our Distrust" [see Kinesis  Nor. 92] about the Vancouver Palestinian and  Jewish Women for Peace. What a great concept, a great model. It's got me thinking.  My background is protestant and anti-  catholic. I'm looking at my racism. I have  been encouraged to reclaim, re-examine my  roots (as an antidote to imperialism). What  comes up painfully for me is an angry and  sorrowful hatred for Catholics.  I am no longer a christian. And I did not  grow up in Ireland. Some of my ancestors  emmigrated from there five generations ago.  But that struggle on Irish soil lives in me.  I wonder if feminists with Irish backgrounds—protestants and catholics—were  to get together to discuss it, what would  happen? Our ancestory is Celtic pagan too.  Was the catholic /protestant thing all a patriarchal scam?  Sincerely,  Laura Ardiel  Ottawa, Ontario  Debating the  use of drugs  Kinesis:  It is heartening to read the debate among  anti-psychiatry feminists, and irresistible to  join.  I was a psychiatric patient, and it took as  long to make sense of that experience as it  did to make sense of the breakdowns that  resulted in my being psychiatrized. For me,  the process of making sense took the form of  writing a book As For The Sky Falling: A  Critical Lookat Psychiatry and Sujfering,which  was published in 1991 by Second Story Press.  It's a feminist critique of psychiatry, written,  needless to say, from a patient's point of  view. I wrote it hoping it would help others  who'd experienced the system to make sense  of it, and also to help people who haven't  experienced it to see what it can feel like to be  on the recieving end of modern high-tech  treatment.  Some people have written to Kinesis  complaining of feminists pressuring them to  go off drugs. I believe firmly that it is a  mistake to presume to make up anyone's  mind for her. This is the basis of my repudiation of psychiatry, and such presumption is  no more acceptable coming from feminists  than it is coming from psychiatrists.  On the other hand, it is sad (possibly no  one's business, but still sad) when people  make uninformed decisions. Susan Moore  writes that her friend Jill "has a disease  caused by a proven chemical imbalance.  Luckily, the drug IM AP is able to restore this  balance, allowing her to lead a normal life."  If Jill finds that IMAP helps her to lead a  normal life, then of course she will want to  keep taking it, and no one should presume to  judge her decision—we do not know her  suffering or her compromises.  But it must be pointed out that psychiatric drugs can be addictive, and abruptly  stopping them is not recommended by anti-  psychiatry groups, instead, a very gradual  cutting down process, often taking months,  is found to make withdrawal bearable. With  support. Withdrawal is common and can be  frightening. It can scare people into getting  back onto even higher doses. Four to six  weeks, the time cited by Susan Moore, is a  very short time even to begin cutting down  (by, say, one-tenth of the dosage). It is much  too short a time for many people to get off  most drugs.  Nor is it true that chemical imbalances  have been "proven" or that drugs work by  restoring those balances. These claims by  psychiatry are ridiculed not only by anti-  psychiatry groups and such well-known  "anti- psychiatrists" as Thomas Szasz and  Peter Breggin, but by neuroscientists.  Furthermore, all drugs have a range of  effect, some devastating, some permanent,  about which patients are often not told. The  fact is, no one knows how these drugs work,  or why some people benefit at some times,  while others benefitnot at all, and still others  find themselves feeling drastically worse.  Given this state of non-knowledge, it  doesn't make sense to chastise Jill for her  decision.  Nor will it do, however, to cite Jill's  experienceasproofthatthepsychiatricmedi-  cal model of mental illness is a useful way to  approach emotional and mental problems.  Formany people, theapproachdoesn'twork.  If there was this high a failure rate in treating  broken bones, we'd be suitably wary. We  should be very suspicious of each of psychiatry's new claims.  In my experience, the anti-psychiatry  movementhasbeenmore influenced by feminism than the feminist movement has by the  anti-psychiatry movement. The debate in  Kinesis may help redress this imbalance.  Sincerely,  Shelagh Lynne Supeene  Waterloo, Ontario  Trigger words at  CRIAW conference  Kinesis:  I was deeply disturbed to read, under  the auspices of the conference, "Making the  Links:Anti-Racism and Feminism" [see Kinesis, Dec/Jan. 93] the type of slogans and  trigger words which, in my experience, lead  only to a highly volatile and often violent  emotional response, obliterating the true  complexity of a situation.  Nahla Abdo-Zubi speaks of "...direct  colonialism, and the nationalist racist state  of Israel." This type of language bears little  resemblance to the multi-dimensional and  tragic Palestinian-Israeli conflict, whichcan-  not be rendered into "black and white"—  that is, my side is good and your side is bad.  Instead of inciting hate, war, abuse and all  forms of violence, we need to define and  develop a very different way of thinking,  communicating and behaving.  Twenty-five years ago, I, along with  other civilians, lay in a trench in a field in the  Midd le Ea st. My despera te hope wa s that the  falling bombs would not score a direct hit.  FEBRUARY 1993 Letters  In 1967, my experience in that trench  had been preceded by six months of militaristic posturing on all sides. The slogan of  most of the protagonists at that time had  been "throw those Jews into the sea." Speaking personally, this was extremely trauma tic  for me, as a woman whose extended family  had been devastated due to the previous  Nazi genocide.  Later that year, having survived the  trenches, I spent six months working as a  translator for the United Nations and the  Red Cross in Sinai, Gaza and the West Bank.  My first assignment was horrific. I visited  the jail in Gaza City where the former Egyptian regime held Palestinians prisoners. The  conditions were unspeakable. I also visited  the Palestinian settlements on the West Bank  and viewed with great pain the hate literature featured in many of the textbooks of  school children. At the same time, I observed  the Israeli military working to provide water  to villages and settlements where the well  had been their only source to date.  I am not so naive as to believe that there  are no racist elements in Israeli society or  among the PalestiniansorCanadiansorany-  where on this planet. I also wish to acknowledge that both the Palestinians and Israelis  legitimately share the right to land which  can be called home.  Due to these experiences, I started to  think carefully about hatred and violence. I  struggled to share and articulate my pain  and rage in ways which are clear, honest and  non-abusive.  There is a trend in the women's movement to allocate to certain groups and peoples a "political correctness" while designating others as "imperialist bad guys." We, as  women, must cease flinging slogans and  start to talk to each other instead of against  each other. When we recognize the many  dimensions and complexities of one another's experience, then perhaps we may be  able to come to grips with the negative aspects of nationalism—with the hurling of  stones and shooting.  Like Abdo-Zubi, I have known and suffered from the blight of racism and would  welcome the opportunity to share instead of  to shatter the potential we have to do good.  As women, let us work together to challenge  hate, violence and racism.  Sincere y,  Naomi Ehren-Lis  Delta, BC  Supported byShanieLevin,Gloria Levy,  Betty C. Nitkin and Alberta Potter  Levintan  We have to  pull together  Kinesis:  I'd like to respond to Karin Mladenovic's  letter [see Kinesis, Sep.92 Jdescribingthedeath  of yet another sex trade worker—the latest in  a series in Vancouver. Many others have  probably been killed since, are being killed  now.  As I write this, feminists and lesbians  here in Montreal protest the rape and murder of women in the McGill ghetto, a University area—murders that police have conveniently chosen to keep under wraps.  I think of a time when I rallied with  these same activists holding a vigil for two  saleswomen who had been assaulted and  murdered in the basement of the clothing  store. The media was there, and so were us  activists, as we almost always are if the  victim is a university student, upper class,  white, and straight—never if she's a prostitute or stripper, never if she is poor, Native,  Black, Asian or whoever else this society  considers worthless. Most white-Anglo-Canadian feminists and lesbians of upper class  status would never dare get their hands  "dirty" by dealing with our realities. As  Karin states "your salaries are more important."  lama sex trade worker, prostitute, call  girl, whore. I'm also a student and activist.  My tricks are my income, pay for my food,  rent mid education. Some days, after working all night, I drag myself to class, listen to  an arrogant male asshole preach shit to passive bodies, bodies who would shun me, do  shun me ' nd if I tell you that sometimes I  want to sh^ot this teacher who was myjohn  yesterday, is my John today, or will be tomorrow, could you empathize with my pain,  or will you deem me crazy, man-hater, violent? Your judgements do not stop him from  battering his wife, abusing his children.  I'm tired like many, many other women  are—tired of the threats, assaults, fear we  live under on the street, in the alley, under  the steering wheel, in our homes; tired of  living the same threats within feminist or  dyke communities—too many negative reactions to the disclosure of my work. I keep  secrets because you find it cool to carry our  lives around as objects or specimens: "I have  a friend that's a sex trade worker." Yet would  you date us? Could you date a whore, especially one that fucks men?  I remember Burcu Ozdemir's letter [See  Kinesis, Feb.92] describing how she, an immigrant, lesbian mother of male sons, was  beaten along with two friends at a lesbian  event. It's one year since the bashing. What  action has been taken to educate your own  lesbians or feminist communities about anti-  mother attitudes, anti-children attitudes?  (And if you don't think anti-mother prejudice exists in lesbian communities, then you  are not a mother, do not know a mother, not  even your own).  As many of you celebrate Christmas or  New Year's or other holidays, who will wipe  this mother's tears when, on the anniversary  of the beating, she is haunted with nightmares of fists in her face, child wailing as  boots kick into his mother's back—women's  boots, women's fists.  I remember Diane Atkinson's words  [see Kinesis, Jul./Aug. 92] on how she was  totally fucked over by a woman's school  writing retreat, Westwords VII: by appearing so stressed, so intelligent, so complicated, so vulnerable—in short, so real. I had  a sense of having failed them.  Why are our realities, our honesty, our  cries so threatening? Is your own life so  pristine and safe that our truth makes you  run? When us "minorities," become bodies  right there in front of you, you cannot ignore  us, your lip service won't work and there are  fewer and fewer places to hide from our  anger, the anger of women of colour, Jews,  immigrants, the working class, prostitutes.  Still, in most lesbian and feminist circles, as  in society at large, there is only one kind of  complexity—a white middleclass one. Nothing else fits.  In Yugoslavia, thousands of mothers,  daughters, brothers are murdered in a so-  called "ethnic cleansing," ignored by the  world, as Blacks in South Africa have been  ignored by the same white American powers who massacred thousandsof Iraqis in the  Gulf War, as Neo-Nazis are, as they rise and  kill people of colour, Jews, immigrants in  Germany, Canada, the US arid elsewhere.  And in the midst of all these happenings, we  are ostracizing, beating, and fighting one  another within women's communities.  By this comparison, I don't mean to  devalue the centuries of struggles of peoples  of the countries mentioned. I just want to  emphasize that race and class oppression,  anti-mother, anti-children, or anti-prostitute  oppressions, are here beside us and within  all of us in some form. Those of us surviving  daily don't have the privilege to ignore hatred.  In lesbian and feminist communities, if  wecannot pull together, form alliances,communicate and dialogue wi th our differences,  if we cannot recognize one another, not as  theories or statistics, but as persons with real  lives and needs, then how can we expect the  world to change?  Martin Luther King said, "We cannot  walk alone." A first step is acknowledging  and owning up to whatever privilege we do  live—white-skin privilege, class or other  privileges. The next step is to use these positions of power for change.  We will not walk alone.  For Burcu, Karin, and Diane: hoping  these word of support and acknowledgement may slightly ease the nightmares.  Sincerely,  Maria Verghinas  Montreal, Quebec  Black History Month events  compiled by Michelle LaFlamme  February is Black History Month, a time to celebrate the history of all people of African  descent.
