We were very  pleased that one member, Lesley Weath-  erston, came all the way from Terrace  to join us!  After outgoing President Roberta  Schlosberg's Report was read, VSW  staff members presented and commented oh their respective sections of  the Annual Report. The Report was  accepted in total.  The elections were held in accordance with the amendments to the constitution passed on May 28th, and  the following are now members of the  Vancouver Status of Women Board of  Directors:  President: Nancy Conrod  Vice-President: Jo Lazenby  Secretary:  Treasurer:  Judy Bourne  Sandy Price  Members-at-Large: Nancy Denefreo,  Lee Grills, Dorothy Holme,  Viviane Hotz, Hanne Jensen,  Karen Richardson  Staff Appointees:  Nadine Allen,  Diana Bissell, Miriam Gropper,  Glinda Sutherland (Ombudswoman)  Ex-Offiqio: Roberta Schlosberg  After the elections we had an opportunity to talk with one another and  indulge in Birthday champagne and  goodies. President's Report  As outgoing president, I would like  very much to be able to claim that  despite the machinations of that  capricious Mother-May—T. (Father-  May-I is really more appropriate)  we call contemporary Canadian society,  the VSW has taken giant steps  forward under my administration.  Given the magnitude of what Canadian  women have yet to accomplish, I cannot be quite that sanguine, however,  about the accomplishments of the VSW  under my term of office. Nevertheless,  there's a good reason for us to. take  genuine pride in our "baby steps."  Each baby step brings us a little bit  closer to our ultimate goal: the  liberation of women.  Enough baby steps'"  and one day that haunting cigarette  commercial which claims "You've come  a long way, baby," will have some  veracity.  The following reports make clear with  painstaking attention to detail just  what the VSW has accomplished in the  past year.  The emphasis is overwhelmingly positive.  This is as it should  be. Too often we choose to concentrate  on what hasn't been accomplished,  which tends to get terribly depressing,  and can be self-defeating. Once in  a while we need to focus on the  significant achievements of the past  year.  One of these I would like to point  out specifically, and this is attitudi-  nal change: we are beginning to be  taken seriously at last. The truth  of this assertion can be seen on an  international level. Whatever drawbacks and disappointments IWY has  brought, and there have been many,  that so august a body as the U.N.  pauses to recognize the special needs  and achievements of women goes a long  way towards legitimizing the women's  movement on a worldwide basis.  We are beginning to be taken seriously  at last.  The truth of this assertion  can be seen with reference to the VSW.  tore and more we are invited by various  levels of government to play a role  however miniscule in policy making,  being specifically asked to serve on  committees, submit briefs, make recommendations re: personnel of important task  forces etc.  This in decided contrast to a past  which saw us too often in a reactive  rather than an active role, a past  which saw us bitterly opposing a  destiny we had no role in shaping.  My only hope is that this change,  which isn't by any means universal,  will have concrete implications  soon for improving the status of  Canadian women.  Each president of the VSW has  brought her own particular skills  to the presidency:  Joan Wallace,  hevr unflagging energy, political  savvy and flair for public relations;  Alice James, her capacity for hard  work and dedication. My skills tend  to be more introspective in nature.  I have not played a major role in  federal or provincial affairs, as  have my predecessors.  Instead, I  have chosen to concentrate on  strengthening the VSW as an or  ganization.  I have1struggled to accomplish the  following:  (1) to make executive meetings more  efficient and meaningful  (2) to improve communications between  executive members and between the  executive and staff  (3) to recognize the individual  accomplishments of the staff,  the executive and the membership  (4) to improve relationships  between the executive and the  staff with an eye to ensuring  that the executive is in a  position to receive immediate  feedback from the staff, to  facilitate the decisionmaking process and ensure the  staff a role in this same  process  (5) to secure for the staff decent  salaries  (6) to be responsive to members.  Only my sister executive officers,  the membership and staff can judge  the success of my efforts.

They kindly provided  us with a slide of the stamp and a  black and white print is shown here.  The stamp was designed by Susan  McPhee of Montreal, using a graphic  variation of the female symbol.  The Canada Post. Office brochure describing the stamp states "Real freedom of opportunity for women will  arrive when society recognizes that  women have the right to pursue whatever goals they may individually  choose, whether the goals are center  ed on home and family or on a career  or on a combination of both. Equality of opportunity can come about  only when Canadians recognize women  as full and equal partners in our  society. Therefore, International  Women's Year is an epoch in which  people should acknowledge what women have done for social, cultural,  political and economic life in Canada. The doorways must be open so  that such contributions can continue,  It even gives the source of the "Why  Not?" slogan: As Shaw said "You can  see things, and you say 'Why?*, but  I see things that never were and I  say 'Why Not?'"  ywca world council  Every four years the YWCA World  Council, with representatives from  around the world, meets to plan the  direction of the world YWCA for the  next four yea^s. This year the Council is meeting in Vancouver, at the  UBC Totem Park Convention Centre,  from July 12-26. Four hundred and  fifty women from more than 80 countries will be present. Athena Athan-  assiou, Greece, president for the  last eight years, will be retiring  and a new president will be elected.  Much of the conference will be devot  ed to planning budgets, projects and  priorities for the coming four years  but some sessions will be open to  the general public. For example,  on July 12 the opening session wil'l  feature a sight and sound presentation entitled "Perspective Canada"  and an opening Roll Call of the delegates. On July 14, the Hon.

The AGENDA was announced at simultaneous press conferences by leaders of  participating women's organizations,  ranging from the Girls Cluhs of America to the National Committee on  Household Employment.  Combining the goals of these national organizations, the AGENDA reflects  the hopes and aspirations of a wide  spectrum of women, from the Association of Junior Leagues to the National Gay Task Force.  Stressing that  the Agenda is an outline for action,  the women serve notice that they will  be working together to realize the  eleven AGENDA priorities:  I. Fair Representation and Participation in the Political Process  II* Equal Education and Training  III. Meaningful Work and Adequate  Compensation  IV. Equal Access to Economic Power  V. Quality Child Care for All  Children  VI. Quality Health Care Services  VII. Adequate Housing  VIII. Fair and Humane Treatment in  the Criminal Justice System  IX.

Next  to the National Film Board, this is  the largest distribution outlet for  Canadian films.  Following are some  of the films listed for rental and  purchase in this catalogue.  For  further information contact Kathryne  Wing, Director of Films By Women programme, Canadian Filmmaker's Distribution Centre, 406 Jarvis St., Toronto  Filmmakers with relevant material  should also contact her. Many of  the filmmakers included in the catalogue are available for personal appearances in conjunction with screening of their films.  Moira Amour — Strategy for Change —  (1972, colour, 30 min. rental $25)'  A film of the First National Status  of Women Conference. Discussions  included Women in Politics, Native  Women's Rights and Education.  Speakers include: Florence Bird, Ex-Chairperson on the Royal Commission on the  Status of Women; Senator Therese  Casgrain; Maryon Kantaroff; Laura  Sabia; Elsie Gregor-McGill; Madeleine  Parent; June Callwood; and Isobel Le  Bourdais.  Recha Jungmann — Two Right, Two  Left, Drop One — (1973,colour,hh  min. rental $6) It is a simple study  of 'love' and possessiveness in the  relationship between man and woman  and woman and woman, and about the  necessity to change the quality of  personal relationships.  Bonnie Kreps — After The Vote—  (1969, b&w, 22 min. rental $25) A  feminist documentary that covers a  lot of informative ground and is enlivened by a sense of humour as well.  This is one of the few films to focus  on women's rights with specific reference to Canadian facts and statistics. Hard-core information, interspersed with shots of beauty queens  bursting into what appears to be  real tears. There are several things  about the movie which Kreps now feels  are inappropriate - a very articulate  male sociologist makes most of the  statements about women, for instance -  but the film still stands as one of  the more enjoyable examples of this  category.  Kim Ondaatje — Black Creek — (1972  colour, 7 min. rental $i0) The film  is concerned with one of the more  successful Local Initiatives Projects.  A group of young people work with  professional construction workers to  restore a portion of Black Creek  Valley and creat a park for community use.  Liane Brandon — Anything You Want  To Be — (1970, USA,b&w, 8 min. rental  $12) Humourously depicts the conflicts and absurdities that beset a  high school girl.  In her bid for  class president, she finds herself  running for secretary; in her desire  to become a doctor, she leaves the  guidance office convinced to be a  nurse; her history book is mysteriously replaced by Joy of Cooking.  Coaxed by voices from TV, movies and  magazines, she mimics female stereotypes; the worldly sophisticate, the  wholesome homemaker, the sexy chick,  the sweet young thing, the imperious  matron and a harried housewife.  (One of the VSW Education Group has  seen this film & says it is good!)  Miriam Weinstein — Living With Peter  — (USA,colour,22 min. rental $25)  A personal documentary on a couple  together without 'the contract'.  Through interviews with her friends,  mother, Peter and just talking to  the camera, Ms. Weinstein explores  the institutional and personal hassles  of living together unmarried.  Peggy Peacock (and Jack Mylnek) —  Weightlifters (1972,b&w,37 min. rental $40) A documentary on life styles  in a high pressure urban environment.  It is inadvertently funny and tragic  at the same time.  the avid articler  Members have been sending in some  great items for the Avid Articler  section so we have a real mixed bag  this time—even some freebies!

LeLong  —WomenSports, July 1975-r-the author  rode alone, on her bicycle, from  Chicago to San Francisco, in 1898.  Her equipment?—"They were few and  simple, consisting mainly of a suitable skirt, and in having heavy soles  put on my shoes. A change of underwear, a few toliet articles, a clean  hanky, which I strapped On my handlebars, and a pistol,which I borrowed  and put in my toolbag, where it would  be hard to get at in case of need."  THE BOOKS THAT TEACH WIVES TO BE  SUBMISSIVE, by Barbara Grizzuti  Harrison—McCall's, June 1975.  "Be a kittenish, sexy, obedient,  home-loving wife.  Such is the message of two surprise best sellers.  Is it possible this is the kind of  marriage women—and many men—really  want today?" The books discussed  are "The Total Woman" by Marabel  Morgan and"Fascinating Womanhood"  by Helen B. Andelin. Ms. Harrison!s  message is that this is not the kind *  of marriage many people want.  WHY IS ROSEMARY RUNNING?, by Lisa  Hobbs—Chatelaine, July 1975—talks  about her bid for the NDP leadership.

We had a beautiful evening,  they're a delightful couple,,  and I asked lots of questions.  No, they aren't familiar with  the Berger Commission, and no,  they don't really know what  community of property legislation  means. Yes, they own their  home, registered in joint  tenancy.  She does not work  for pay outside the home, and  he has an executive position for  which he is very well remunerated.  Married 25 years, his car belongs  to him and hers belongs to her.  She is involved in community  activities, but readily agrees  that she could never earn as  much money as he does.  Both  see marriage as a partnership,  and as to posessions other than  house and cars -—  "Yes, they belong to both of us.  I paid for them."  Conversation has stalled for a  moment.  Her: But we both own them.  Him: Well, I paid for them.  Me: But to whom do they belong?  Him: I'm not too sure.  Should  they really belong to  both of us equally?  Yes, of course they should. But  I'm not going to really press the  point in this conversation, because  I see the bewildered look on her  face.  If I press the point and he  defends his position, I want it  to be someday when I know them  better.  Incredible, though, how positions  change when words are connected  with reality — partnership with  economic, for example.  Incredible  how we can stretch our definitions  of words to make them mean what  they mean to us.  There is a lot of mind-stretching  going on amongst the members of  the legal profession, our legislators, and the cabinet. Suddenly  community of property is no longer  words alone, but has become a dollar  proposition. "Do we really mean  it that much?" they're asking.  The B.C. Branch of the Canadian  Bar Association held its annual  general meeting this month,  and voted to ask the government  for delay and further investigation of community property.  Some 85 to 90% of the lawyers  in B.C. are men, and the discussion took place under the  title "For Better or for  Worse: Community of Property."  In preparation for the  discussion, the lawyers received  a mailing mentioning "massive  changes in the law" and including  eight suggested wordings for  requesting delay. They were  also asked to agree or  disagree with the following  statements in the Berger  Commission Report — among  others:  "All property acquired during  the marriage 1$ (i.e., should  be) shared and managed equally."  "(Community of property) is a  system which reflects the way  most of us now order our  married lives."  "The roles of economic provider and homemaker are of  equal-value to the relationship.  Here are some of the more bizarre  quotes from their meeting:  "Instead of saving marriages,  the proposed act will promote  breakup. Many subsisting and  marginal marriages will be  wound up...."  "...this proposal will give  economic advantage to family  instability and marriage  breakdown."  Do these men really believe  in marriage by financial  coercion? Would sharing  their property as well as  their beds actually destroy  their happy homes?  There are 50 men and 5 women  in the B.C. legislature. How  would they respond to questions j  such as I put to my friends  last night? Would there  be a" difference in response  if I asked legislator's spouses  rather than the legislators  themselves?  Lee Masters.  -vsw brief  The following is a BRIEF ON THE  REVISION OF MINIMUM WAGE ORDERS,  submitted to The Board of Industrial Relations of British  Columbia by the Vancouver Status  of Women.  The Vancouver Status of Women is  specifically concerned with minimum wage orders in three areas:  age and minimum wage, rate of  minimum wage, and rest periods.  1. Age and Minimum Wage  We believe that a lower minimum wage for workers who are  seventeen years of age and  under is discriminatory and  contrary to the philosophy of  human rights legislation. Indeed,  it allows employers to exploit the  youth category and contributes  to the exclusion of older workers.  WE RECOMMEND THAT ONE MINIMUM  WAGE COVER ALL WORKERS.  2. Rate of Minimum Wage  Women workers, because of their  presently low status in the  labour force, are particularly  dependent upon the provision of  minimum wage. Since the establishment of the present rate of  minimum wage, costs have risen.  For reference year, April, 1974  to May, 1975, the Vancouver Consumer Price Index rose from 154.9  to 170.0, an increase of 9.7%.  WE RECOMMEND THAT THE MINIMUM  WAGE BE RAISED ACCORDINGLY.  3. Rest Periods  The present provisions for rest  periods excludes female pharmacists and male workers. We believe  that rest periods are essential to  the wellbeing of all workers.  WE RECOMMEND THAT REST PERIODS BE  EXTENDED TO ALL WORKERS.  wcwn  i  WOMEN INTERESTED IN RESEARCH AND  WRITING  Western Canadian Women's News Service is looking for women to become  involved in the project as reporters  and researchers.  WCWN was established in May 1974 to  increase coverage of women's news in  B.C. and the Yukon. Each month, several articles—covering women's activities, legislation, resources,  issues—are distributed to women's  groups, media, government, community  agencies, educational institutions,  etc.  We need people to help in researching and writing articles, and/or preparing booklets on women's issues.  We can pay a token honorarium for  articles used, and a percentage on  other materials produced for sale."  Come and talk with us about it—we  would like your ideas and participation.

REDLIGHTTHEfflRE  ballet  Whenever I read about the women who  were involved in the struggle to gain  such basic rights as the vote for Canadian women, I am struck by several  things—their incredible energy and  determination, their loving comrad-  ship, and their humour. And I was  delighted to find that this is the  way the Redlight Theatre, Canada's  professional women's theatre, presents our foremothers.  "What Glorious Times They Had" concerns Nellie McClung and members of  the Political Equality League and  their battles with Sir Rodmond Rob-  lin, then Premier of Manitoba and a  firm believer that woman's place was  in the home.  Set in Winnipeg from  1912 to January 27, 1916, when the  vote was won, the play uses six actors—four women and two men.  Diane Grant, director of the play  and founding member of Redlight  Theatre, researched through the Manitoba and Alberta Archives to write  "What Glorious Times They Had".  Many  of the lines in the play are familiar  to readers of Nellie McCLung—they  are from her speeches and books and  letters.  It's pretty hard to improve  on the way Nellie said something!  The Canadian suffragists made great  use of wit and farce to drive home  a point and the play recreates a  part of the mock parliament staged  by the Political Equality League in  Winnipeg in 1914. Playing the part  of the Premier, Nellie McClung brought  down the house when she informed the  delegate from "Fellows for the Franchise" that "male children have always proved more difficult to toliet  train than female children and this  difficulty would doubtlessly carry  over into their training in Parliamentary procedure." Furthermore,  she reasoned, it was not necessary  to give men the vote as any system  which could produce such charming  examples of manhood should not be  tampered with.  The play was peppered with temperance  songs of the era—"Going Dry","Heaven  Will Protect the Working Girl" and  "I Must Go Home Tonight" — sung with  great verve. The cast seemed to be  having a good time and the audiance  certainly was!  Redlight Theatre is touring Western  Canada to celebrate IWY. Try to see  them!  -Jo Lazenby  poem  Medication  The mist rolls in,  waves eddying up the bedsheets  as i breasstroke toward you.  The sediment collects  while my voice responds  to a question asked eons ago.  Grey syrop, grey air  floating, floating  as my grey matters jerks  through its familiar ruts.  Mtr foot fights through mud  groping toward the gas pedal.  A stop sign swims into focus  as I drive past it.  I am not surfing, cresting  just treading water  watching a rainbow form  on the oily surface  as four waterskiers  skim effortlessly  over turquoise horizons.  -Kathy Tyler  book:  Les Femmes Innovatrices (The Women  Innovators) by Colette Carisse and  Joffre Dumazedier, published by Editions du Seuil. Deals with the reality of the lives of Quebec women compared with their dreams, how they are  viewed by the press, how their behaviour triumphed over tradition in different sectors of society.  Sexist Religion and Women in the  Church: No More Silence, by Alice L.  Hageman, published by G.R. Welch Co  Ltd. The book grew out of the experience of the Women's Caucus at the  Harvard Divinity School, and deals  with the development of non-stereotyped expressions of faith and celebration.

BOOK  REVIEW  ANALYSING AND AGONISING  Fear^f^l^jing^ by Erica Jong  (Signet Paperback $ 1.95)  I approached this book with a certain  amount of .caution for two reasons:  1) one review I read waxed lyrical  over how delicious it was that women  could be uninhibited about sex (and  by implication, how unusual) and  how scared any male will be 'who  believes women don't think like that'  which only goes to show we still have  a long way to go, baby, and that you  should take no notice of book reviews.  And 2) I belong to the school of  thought that feels that anyone who  relys on a psychiatrist to solve  their problems, needs their head  examined, which is no doubt unfair  and unjust, but there it is.  So what do we have here? - a journey  literally and mentally, of a woman  trying to come to terms with herself,  but not I presume, and rather hope,  your average North American woman.  For starters our 'heroine' Isadora,  is not only a woman but also Jewish  and a poet - shades of Sammy Davis  who when asked his golf handicap  replied, "I am Jewish, black, with  one eye, what more do I need?" But  Isadora has much more to contend  with, notably, a psychotic first husband who thinks he's Christ and tries  to strangle her; a neurotic, 'artistic'  family who scream and pass judgement  on each others' lives with manic  ferocity; an inscrutable Oriental  psychiatrist husband who'doesn't  understand' except within his own  terms of reference; an overwhelming  hatred for Germans; a morbid fascination for concentration camps and  lavatories, and an over-riding self  destroying guilt about practically  everything. Oh yes, she also has a  mother, not really up to Portnoy  standards, but right in there to  take her share of the blame.  This  last is particularly depressing since  I had hoped we had outgrown 'the  woman made me do it* syndrome, although  to be fair it is also stressed that  living with a murderous second-hand  Jesus, had its shortcomings.  The story takes place mostly in Vienna  where Isadora goes with her husband  to a convention of psychiatrists. Not  the ideal place for a German hating,  unanalysable, unstable, Jewish poet  to sort herself out, one would think  and one would be right.  So far I have been very negative  about 'Fear' and indeed often felt  the urge to shake Isadora and her  fellow thespians, which at the very  least argues an involvement in the  story.  On the more positive side,  it is a very generous book, bursting  with ideas, thoughts, literary throw-  aways, that set the mind and imagination  racing, and it is all poured out and  handed over, very often with a smile.  The language is witty, clever and  liberally sprinkled with the four  letter word we are unable to print in  Kinesis, but which has been given  government sanction as fuddle. Each  chapter is prefaced by a poem or some  very relevant prose, from Edna O'Brien  'The vote, I thought, means nothing  to women, we should be armed' to Lord  Byron who shall have the last word.  * Some take a lover, some take drams  or prayers.  Some mind their  household, others dissipation,  some run away, and but exchange  their cares, losing the advantage  of a virtuous station; few changes  e'er can better their affairs.  Their's being an unnatural situation, from the dull palace to  the dirty hovel: some play the  devil, and then write a novel/  (Don Juan)  - Margaret Nicholls  FEMINIST ENGLISH/NGN SEXIST VOCABULARY  "To date, the discipline of scholarship has been a ritual celebrating  patriarchal man's sense of himself.  From a feminist point of view, dictionaries are museum pieces of an archaic culture. Yet they are a powerful reinforcing expression of men's  prejudice against women. The old  lexicography is illustrated by stereotyped sexism, a degrading system of  classification in which masculine  form is primary and feminine form  undefined.  We would do away with both feminine  and masculine terms.  Feminist terminology avoids the words, the order  and gender signals which are oppressive to women and male dominant."  Feminist English Dictionary, A Woman's  Guide To Dirty Words, 1973.  Language may seem an insignificant  way to change the status of women.  However, since words restrict and  define our ways of thinking, language is fundamental to our attitudes  about women.  The women's movement is modifying its  vocabulary in order to avoid mysogy-  nist expressions.  Feminists see this  revision as necessary in order to  adapt a new definition of womanhood.  To many women the question is not  linguistic so much as political.  As long as women are treated unequally, language will reflect and  reinforce the inferior female stereotype.  Words assume special meanings according to the context of the culture  they emerge from.  In English 'female  adjectives and nouns are derogatory  by implication rather than by out-.  right assertion. A case in point  is the term "lady".  To feminists "lady" is the newest  four-letter word. They see it as  a euphemism, superficially a gest-  Feminist English  ure of respect, but implying helplessness requiring chivalry. A lady  (whose sexuality is not supposed to  be apparent) is castrated, unwomanly.  A lady is a female eunuch.  Feminists  prefer to be called women.  Similarly, feminists are insulted by  the word "girl" when used for females  over age 18.  Girl is a back-handed  compliment that although you may be  middle-aged you are still attractive,  eg. older women are unloveable, and  women should never grow up. The women's movement equates the sexist  terms "girl/chick/broad" with the  terms "boy/cock/stud."  Some feminists are also concerned  with obscenity. For this they have  been called prudes. However, their  objection is that swear words often  have a sadistic intent toward women  and make them into sex-objects denying women their humanity. Therefore  the women's movement is just as outraged about sexist obscenity as it  is by racial and ethnic slurs.  Central to the matter is that English  has a bias towards the male form of  words as primary.  Feminists contend  that continual exposure to masculine  gender vocabulary influences the female self-concept negatively. They  note the absence of positive female  role words.  Pointing out that English expresses  the relationship between the sexes .  mainly in male dominant terms, they  would refer to people in the non-  sexist plural thereby eliminating  cumbersome references to he/she,  chairman/woman,etc.  For example: They all brought their  lunches" rather than "Everyone brought  his lunch'Äû"  Non-sexist terminology is now intlu-  encing such large companies as McGraw-  Hill who have changed their copy rules  ,to eliminate unnecessary gender pronouns in educational texts.  Some  newspapers have revised copy style  to include feminist terminology.  The  law may also come to be expressed this  way.  The women's movement intends to eliminate the English linguistic double  standard. Feminists believe that  English as a living language should  reflect the needs of those who communicate with it and change when their  needs require so.

It's a pretty wide field to  cover and we're looking for a fair  amount of input from readers. Ideas,  facts, opinions, suggestions.  It seems that today with the breakaway from the traditions of family  solidarity and church morality to  a much "freer" lifestyle, we are all  having to look inward for the answers,  to depend on our own judgement of a  situation, and sometimes our judge*  ment's pretty shaky; decision-making  becomes a very lonely business. And  much tougher if you've been used to  sharing your life with and depending  on another person.  And sometimes these problems vary  according to the age of the individual. As one gets older, surely some  problems are more acute, others become  less significant.  It might be interesting to try and catch hold of these  changes and be more aware of the feelings and thoughts of others as they  learn to face a new problem or hassle  with an old one in a different way.  It was just such a turn of events in  Elsie Palmer's life that prompted her  to try and make things easier for widows, like herself, and divorcees.  In  1972, two years after her husband died  Elsie decided to "get into something"  and she took a 6 week continuing education "participation" course at  good ol' U.B.C. during which each  person was invited to present her  particular project and ideas to her  class. Elsie's idea was to start a  group for women who suddenly find  ELSIE PALMER OF LIVING  IS FOR EVERYONE  themselves alone, and with help from  the Y.W.C.A. and U.B.C, L.I.F.E.  (Living is for Everyone) was formed.  It has proved a worthwhile group.  Thirty-five women, all widowed or  separated or divorced, from the 45  to 85 age group meet every Wednesday  at the Y.W.C.A. for group discussion,  friendship, support and fun.  The  aim simply is to help newly-widowed  or newly-separated women.  The group  has compiled a brochure of "Preparedness" to help deal with the problems  that have to be dealt with when there  is a death. And, too, social contact  is an important issue when one's married friends "drop" you when you become a "single". They have a special  night out every month. A feminist,  consciouness-raising group of 5 or 6  women meet independently from the  main group and choose topics for discussion. L.I.F.E. is an active, swinging group!  So here is an example of one woman  who used her own sad experience for  the benefit of others, and who now  finds her life taking a whole new  direction, totally different from  one she might have anticipated a few  . years before.  Elsie Palmer is taking a counselling course at the Pastoral Institute to give her skills to  help women who are facing difficulties.

Guilty Until Proven Innocent  There is nothing personal in  Quebec Attorney General Jerome  Choquette's bid to convict Dr.  Henry Morgentaler on charges of  committing abortion.  So  Choquette said last week in  Montreal as he announced that  the Quebec "justice department"  was going to appeal the second  not-guilty verdict handed  down by a jury.  However, it  is clear the "Humanist of the  year", Morgentaler, is causing  the government of Quebec  considerable embarassment.  Two years before he imported  surgical equipment for his  Montreal clinic, Morgentaler  submitted a brief to the  parliamentary committee considering revisions to the  Criminal Code. Amongst other  humanitarian recommendations,  Morgentaler called for the removal  of abortion from the Criminal Code  with the operation to become a  matter between a women and her  physician. The recommendation  was ignored and "legal abortion  with obstruction" was passed as  Section 251 of the Criminal Code.  Under this section abortions are  only legal if first approved by  a therapeutic abortion committee  in an accredited hospital.  Clearly one of the major obstructions to equal medical access for  all women is the fact that only  19% of all Canadian hospitals  have established these committees..  After the inequities of this "legal  abortion with obstruction" became  apparent, Morgentaler decided to  open a Montreal Clinic (in Quebec  only 10% of hospitals have established Therapeutic Abortion Committees) using the most modern and  safe surgical equipment. Before he  was arrested, Morgentaler had  performed nearly 7,000 abortions ,  with not one single fatality.  An outstanding record. Morgentaler  also performed an abortion on  television to demonstrate the new  suction technique.  In November 1973, four years after  opening his clinic and  following the televised operation,  Morgentaler was brought to trial.  The french speaking jury of one  woman and eleven men heard the  evidence presented by the prosecution and received the instructions  of the Trial Judge regarding the  law. The jury of ordinary people  found Dr. Morgentaler NOT GUILTY..  The government of Quebec however  is not to be embarassed with  impunity. Acting under a special  provision designed for criminals  (although Morgentaler had been  acquitted) suspected of leaving  the country, the Quebec police  were instructed to raid Morgentaler 's office and home. The  police confiscated early diaries,  letters from his children and some  cassette tapes. At the same time  Morgentaler's assets: bank  account, safety deposit boxes  and real estate, were all frozen.  The embarassing jury verdict,  (embarassing to the federal  DR. HENRY MORGENTALER  The following telegram was sent on  June 18th to Prime Minister Trudeau,  Justice Minister Otto Lang, and  Quebec Attorney-General Jerome  Choquette. The signatures were . -  collected at the 4th Annual General  Meeting of the Vancouver Status of  Women and are representative of its  members.  "Prosecution has become persecution  for Dr. Morgentaler and women. Change  the law, pardon its victim now, not  later." ,  government and to Quebec's  government) was taken before  the Quebec Court of Appeals by  the prosecution.  In April 1974  the court decided that Judge  Hugessen had improperly charged  the jury in the first trial.  Rather than risk a retrial  and another not guilty verdict  from a jury, the judges on the  Quebec Court of Appeals expediently found Morgentaler guilty.  Frank Scott, former Dean of McGill  University Law School, said of  this capricious action that it  "renders the jury concept ridiculous". Morgentaler was sentenced  to 18. months in jail.  Still innocent from a jury viewpoint  Morgentaler went to jail for ten  days. Upon appealing the Quebec  Court of Appeals imprisonment  edict, Morgentaler was released  on his own recognizance. The  prosecution then objected to the  bail terms and dispatched two  policemen to awaken Morgentaler with  a view to returning him to jail.  Knowing that Morgentaler's assets  were frozen the prosecution  demanded that he post a substantial  cash bond or be returned to jail.  The prosecution also demanded that  Morgentaler be prohibited from  making public statements. The  court however, denied the demands  of the prosecution and Morgentaler  remained out on bail.  The government of Quebec also instigated legal proceedings against  Morgentaler's head nurse. As of May  3, 1975,she faced "preferred chatges"  on two counts for assisting. Morgentaler wrote in May 1975 that he had  promised over the telephone to "pay  all her legal expenses." He wrote  further that he had good reason to  believe that their telephones were  .being tapped,during the past two  years.  If this is true it is further  evidence of the perversity of the  persecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler.  In March 1975 the Supreme Court of  Canada upheld the decision of the  Quebec Court of Appeal. The decis-r  ion was less than unanimous, however,  with six judges concurring and three,  including the Chief Justice Bora  Laskin, dissenting. Two major issues  develop from the decision. First,  was trial judge Hugessen in error  when he charged the jury that defences under section 45 and section  7(3) of the Criminal Code were open  to Morgentaler.  Second, was the  Quebec Court of Appeals within its  jurisdiction to reverse the jury  decision rather than to order a re*  trial.  The first issue is by no means  beyond doubt.  Chief Justice  Laskin in commenting upon the  Quebec Court of Appeals wrote:  "It was the opinion of the court  that S45 was not available as a  defence to a charge under S25  (or in the opinion of at least  one of the judges, if open was not  applicable in this particular  case) and that the defence of  necessity, in so far as it could  be a seperate defence, was not  supported by any evidence that  would bring it into play...."  Although the five judges were  unanimous in their result, they  were not unanimous in their  reasons, according to Laskin.  Chief Justice Laskin in dissenting in the Supreme Court  decision wrote that he believed  that both defences were available.  He argues that trial judge  Hugessen could only charge the  jury as he did "on the basis  that there was evidence to go to  the jury..." "In my opinion"  Laskin wrote "there was some  such evidence in the present  case".' Laskin emphasises that  it was for the jury to decide  whether the evidence was sufficient. He writes, moreover,  that "once it is decided, as in  my opinion is the case here,  that there was evidence to go  to the jury on the two defences  which, again in my opinion, were  properly left to the jury, the  jury's verdict is not one which  can be lightly interfered with,  by the appellate Court."  The second issue of an appeals  court reversing a jUry verdict  finds so little support among  even the opponents of Doctor  Morgentaler's case, that one  is led to the conclusion that  some sinister force is behind  his imprisonment.  Supreme  Court Justice Pigeon, who agreed  with the appeals court reversal,  wrote: ''it cannot be denied that  to authorize a court of appeal  to enter a verdict of guilty on  appeal from an aquittal by jury  verdict is a major departure  from the traditional principles  of English criminal law under  which where an accused has been  given in charge to a. jury, none  but the jury can find him guilty."  Supreme Court chief justice Laskin  wrote on behalf of Justices Spence  and Judson: "Counsel for the respective parties were unable to produce  ,any such case, and I am not particularly surprised." Laskin  himself was unable to find any  reported Canadian case where the  not guilty verdict of a jury had  been reversed by an appeals court.  Why is it then that in one hundred  years of Canadian legal history  and eight hundred years of British  legal history there has never been  a reported case of an appeals court  reversing a jury verdict of not  guilty. What is so special, so  unique ab out Morgentalers case  that has broken 900 years of legal  tradition and history. Why were  Morgentalers assets frozen, and  his personal belongings confiscated?  Why was Doctor Morgentaler refused  his medication in Quebec prisons?  Why was he forced to strip naked  twice in one day before guards in  Waterloo prison? Why was he forced  into a solitary confinement cell  late at night with no clothes 'and  no medication for his heart  condition.  Henry Morgentaler wrote:  "It is  obvious now that it is the intention  of the authorities to destroy me by  all possible means." Yet Jerome  Choquette says there is nothing  personal.  If not personal, Mr.  Choquette what is the explanation  for Dr. Morgentalers persecution?  Mr. Roche, the MP for Edmonton-  Strathcona, asked Otto Lang Minister of Justice, in the House  of Commons May 29th 1975,  "with  reference to provincial actions,  what instruction or advice is  he (Lang) giving the attorney  general of Quebec, in light of  the reported ignoring of the  abortion law by 103 doctors who  have admitted performing or  helping women to obtain illegal  abortions?"  Mr. Lang replied  "this issue is very much a matter  for the provincial attorneys  general, the one who seems least  to need advice from me is the one  from the province of Quebec.^  What is Mr. Lang inferring?  Has Mr. Choquette some personal  opinion which is well known to Mr.  Lang but not to the general public.  Or can we assume then that the 103  doctors so described will shortly  be brought to trial, and persecuted  in the same manner as Dr. Morgentaler.  If you do not persecute them in the  same manner Mr. Choquette we shall  certainly know that you are not telling the truth. We shall know  further that it is the intention  of the authorities to destroy Dr.  Henry Morgentaler'.  •—Andrew Whitaker , C.A.R.A.L.  - Motherhood - Freedom of Choice  As I write this, the news comes over  the radio that yet another jury has  acquitted Dr. Henry Morgentaler.  It  will be interesting to see what the  government does with this verdict.  If you remember, last time they made  a hash of the whole jury system by  reversing the decision in Supreme  Court.  Leads you to wonder, doesn't it,  about the regard our leaders have  for the will of the people they  govern. Twice now, juries have  ignored Crown evidence to return a  verdict of "not guilty." And  this is exactly their job:  to  give the people the final say on  whether an antique and valueless  law shall be enforced.  Justice Minister Lang seemed to be  aware of this when he wrote his  recent memorandum on abortion:  "The laws pertaining to abortion,  as indeed all laws, must reflect some general consensus among  Canadians, failing which they will  not be respected."  Something like God, Mom and the Flag:  Everybody's in favour of them in  principle, but in practice...  "Our government has steadfastly  refused to accede to the many  representations we receive...to  remove abortions from the Criminal  Law and we have no intention of  widening the law..."  Lang again—a masterpiece of doublethink when you realize that it comes  from the same memo as that charming  statement about the sanctity of  public opinion.  What is the general consensus  among Canadians, anyway? The  Gallup Poll of last year showed  that 62% of all Canadians thought  abortion should be a matter between  a woman and her doctor. Not that  this is news, mind you; the same ■  poll showed 61% held that same  opinion 3 years ago. Ho Hum.  But Lang believes that "to take  the life of an unborn child" will  lead to some sort of disregard'for  life in general.  "Those persons who  would so easily end a human life  through abortion may soom be willing to do so in other circumstances."  "Interference with an individual alive  seems to me...to reflect an approach  which would lead us to a very different  system (than democracy)."  The point is that how things "seem"  to Otto Lang is damned irrelevant.  He is talking a lot of eyewash. ' The'  fact remains that there is no evidence  to show that liberal abortion laws  lead to totalitarian states.  Quite  the opposite, Nazi Germany had quite  stringent anti-abortion laws and it  was not noted for its reluctance to  end human life.  On the contrary, the governments which  have liberalized their abortion laws  have done so out of humane motives—  concern for the health and life of  the mother (not that of a nine-week-  old agglomeration of cells whose  existence as an"individual" is debatable) .  The first concern in such countries  has been reducing the number of illegal abortions. There are no exact  figures for how many women die of illegal abortions each year. Only educated guesses. Dr. Christopher  Tietze of the Population Planning  Foundation in New York estimated a  conservative 500 a year in the USA  In the mid-60s. This doesn't sound  too bad when you consider that 25,000  illegal abortions were probably being  done at that time. But when you realize that normal childbirth is fatal  20 times out of 100,000 and legal  abortion at an early stage results  in death only once or twice for the  same number of women, you start to  get a rather unpleasant message.  Nobody, of course, has any real idea  how many women are hospitalized,  sterilized, or otherwise incapacitated by illegal abortions. Here  or anywhere else.  It's illegal, you  know. Rather than make trouble for  herself, a woman will insist that  she "fell down the stairs." And a  few doctors press the subject, however obvious it may be.  Still, the Ministry of Pensions in  Britain estimated that some 76,000  working days a year were lost by s '  some 6,000 women before the abortion  law reform in that country. The  figure is probably conservative.  The same countries that have liberalized their abortion laws have, in  several cases (Sweden, for example)  also set up advisory boards to determine the cause for abortion re^t •  quests.  If there is some sort of  social relief that will help a woman continue her pregnancy, this is  offered to the woman as an alternative. Hardly anti-life systems,  these. And unlike the countries  which allow easy abortion* our  humane democracy offers precious  little social relief to the unwinding mother.  Take the hypothetical case of a wow  man, a waitress with three children,  say, whose husband earns $3000 a year  at labouring—when he can get a ,'ob.  We'll say they live in Vancouver  where the unemployment rates are as  high as the housing costs. When this  woman loses her job—and she will  (there is still no law to protect  a woman's job security when she has  a baby)— the family will be in the  unenviable position of supporting  more people in the same cramped  space on less money.  The fact remains that no contraceptive is 100% certain. Aside from the  pill—which many women can't take  for medical reasons—there is no  method which does better than 97%.  Most contraceptives don't even get  that good a rating.  And even if every fertile Canadian  woman used a 99% sure contraceptive,  there would still be 50,000 unwanted  pregnancies every year. The actual  number is probably five times that.  And so on.  I could continue for another 50 pages,  except I am starting to get depressed.

I was recently invited to watch a rugby  football game and my immediate response  was a firm negative prefaced by an expletive deleted.  I well remembered  the many hours spent watching the object of my affection, fighting (literally)  for the honour and glory of the old  whatnotians, while I stood ankle deep  in mud, invariably in the pouring  rain, often in imminent danger of being clobbered by a wet muddy football  or driven into the ground by a hurtling mass of bodies, who in the heat  of the moment had lost sight of the  sidelines.  Upon reflection I decided  that Canadians, generally speaking,  treat their fans more humanely than  their British counterparts and that  a stiff upper lip was not necessarily  part of the price of admission.  Be-  'sides, it was a lovely sunny evening  and included in the invitation was  supper at a local hostlery.  I would  watch the complete Ring Cycle, un-  interupted, on ice, to get out of  cooking dinner once in a while, so  I gracefully accepted.  The thing is, I had forgotten what  an idiotic game it is.  Thirty  beefy young men, fifteen a side,  hurling themselves at each other,  often with most painful results, for  the sole purpose of placing a rather  odd shaped ball over a chalk line,  or kicking it between two wooden  posts.  And it must be the only  game in tne woria where you pass  the ball backwards, that is , in  the opposite direction to which you  actually want it to go.  Imagine  the scenario; a beefy young man has  caught the ball out of the scrum,  a hilarious set up in itself, where  16 muscular backsides are pointed  heavenwards while 16 upperbodies are  locked in an apparent death grip.  Having caught the ball, the beefy  young man runs like mad, forwards  I am happy to say, towards the  chalk line.  If he is lucky and  very fast he may well advance some  ten or fifteen yards without being decapitated, but by then he  will have come into smart contact  with several beefy young men on  the opposing side, and to avoid  permanent mutilation, he will pass  the ball to a team-mate.  But  since it must go backwards, they .  more often than not wind up exactly, where they started, give or  take a missing ear or two.  Talking of missing ears, the  medical services are scarcely  .believable - to start with,  usually there aren't any, but  in this case were supplied by  a man with a large sponge in  one hand and a plastic bucket  in the other. The other non-  playing member of the cast was  the referee and for mv money,  he was the star of the game. An  immaculate figure in snowy white  and obviously in tremendous shape,  he was right up with the action,  blowing his whistle and handing out  penalties with magisterial aplomb.  When two of the players forgot they  were amateurs, he lept forward,  placed a well-manicured hand upon  each sweaty chest, delivered a little  homily on good manners and then, and  I swear I am not making this up, made  the miscreants shake hands.  Re-  quiescat in pace, Avery Brundage.  Why do they do it? A very limited  survey produced the answer,'because  its fun and whats more, its good  clean fun.' Well, fun it may be,  good fun even, but clean it ain't  and I don't just mean all that mud  and blood.  Bobby Clarke and his  chums would feel right at home in  the scrum. A justification that its  a safety valve for all that male  machismo and masculine violence often found in young, and not so young,  men is probably nearer the mark. Not  to mention all that beer in the clubhouse later.  It seems to me this is the other  occasion where one can say with sincerity, Vive le difference.  -Margaret Nicholls  projects  DEPRESSION    WOMEN  — MUSIC —  During the 1930's, thousands of  girls, not able or willing to be  financial burdens on their families,  left home and joined the ranks of  the single, unemployed women.  Jobs  were scarce and poor paying. The few  jobs available were usually in the  near-slavery conditions of domestic  service. Relief, difficult and humiliating to obtain, was inadequate.  Single, unemployed women in Vancouver were give $3,10 per week for  their food, clothing and housing.  This was reduced to $2.80 per week  in 1932.  Only the poorest of food  and shelter could be obtained at this  price. *  Many of these women fell to prostitution. Evelyn Leseur reported in  the Province of April 13, 1935 that  the "white slave market was going  strong." Many groups including the  Vancouver Council of Women, the Y.W.  C.A. and the Mothers Council, campaigned for better conditions and  useful employment for these women.

Discovering the history of our fore-  mothers has always been surprising  for me. But nothing has provided me  with more insight ihto the reality  of life at the turn of the century  for a working class woman, than the  diary of my great grandmother.  Alice Lines Johnson was 33 in 1899,  and married 13 years to blacksmith.  Her entries in the diary are sketchy  and only cover the winter and spring  months but they reveal much.  I was  most interested in her notes on the  status of housework, childbirth,  childcare and health.  Women are frequently told that we  have gained much freedom from drudgery through the use of labour saving  devices.  Few of us have a good idea  what housework was actually like in  those days.  In fact, it was heavy  labour.  Imagine the bitter winter  of 1899 in Toronto, in a wood frame  house with no central heating.  Imagine shoveling some 3 feet of snow  back into the yard to reach the water  pump.  Imagine a frozen well, and a  load of laundry to do.  In January 1899, Alice writes,"Washed  today, but did not get it all finished.  I had all the water to carry,  snow to shovel, ice to break and a  cross baby to mind too!"  Today we complain because we have  housework to do after work.  Imagine  doing housework literally all day.  "Sweeping, scrubbing and a small portion of the tub was the order of things  today...sewing and housework was the  program for today...the usual routine  of work and ill health," writes Alice  that winter.  In those days, taking  milk from the "hygiene dairy" was a  luxury.  When was the last time any of us made  our own clothes? Alice doesn't day,  but she either sewed her children's  W  omen in  1899  things entirely by hand or with the  slow aid of a treadle machine. "Sewed  all afternoon making baby a dress,  finished it all but the buttons and  button holes. Made it out of my blue  skirt," Alice notes* Alice also ran  the vegetable garden and tended the  chickens.  Today, although contraception is not  100% effective, most of us take it  more or less for granted. Only 76  years ago, women got pregnant over  1.3  and over again, whether they wanted  to or not. Not Alice. For ten years  she was barren. Then, in her 30's  she had five kids in a row. Today,  we'd rather not have any after 25!  The gravity of childbirth was well  reported in 1899, but at least they  had midwives.  "Brother Will's wife  Sarah expects to be confined the 10th  of February. Mother is to be with  her at the time...Glad that Sarah is  over it safely...Sarah is woefully  white,"notes Alice.  Even though Alice was confined to the  house much of the time, the close  proximity of her family precluded  the isolation which nuclear family  mothers suffer from today. The family  participated in child care daily.  "Nellie took Willie to his grandmother's where he had tea...Brother Will  took Willie over home for awhile..."  With relatives dropping in daily,  Alice could chat with peers or go  shopping at Timothy Eaton's without  a fuss.  Grip and consumption were common in  1899 winters. Typhoid was not unheard  of, nor was cancer,  "Mrs. Crass entered hospital and has been operated  on for cancer of the breast. Poor  Soul," says Alice.  Cancer of the  breast is devasting today. Imagine  what it was like in 1899.  When her husband died in 1926, Aliee  rented rooms in her house and became  a landlady. Her grandchildren grew  up there, in the 1940's, dying their  hair blonde, wearing short skirts,  and smoking cigarettes.  She didn't  approve but she tolerated it. Alice  lived to be 89. She died in 1955  when I was 7.  I wonder what Alice  would have to say about the women's  movement today.  I wonder what I will  have to say at age 51 in 1999?  -Karen Richardson  housewives league  "The Housewives League in B.C. in 1939  consisted of twelve branches, mostly  in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley  areas. The purpose and function of  the League was to establish protec  tion for the consumer against war profiteering on food stuffs.  They rer-  fused to endorse a Government proposal to study food prices, declared war  on profiteers and started at once to  organize protest meetings.  In 1939, they established the Consume  er Research Council, and in 1943 they  began opening Consumer Bureaus.  In May of 1947, a buyer's strike was  organized. They boycotted butter,  jams, canned fruit and clothing. They  picketed with signs bearing such captions as "Buy No Clothing". The buyers strike was a success—they managed to cut sales by 25 per cent}  In 1948, a campaign against high milk  prices was initiated. They made  statements to the public,such as,  "Unless you have small babies in  your home, don't put out your milk  bottle on Monday."  During the great flood on the Fraser  River in 1948, they,along with other  women's groups, worked around the  clock, operating canteens and evacuating the elderly, and were later  to comment,"We dtood in water to  serve the coffee."  In May of that same year, they organized a 48 hour beef boycott. They  descended, along with 500 other housewives from all over Canada, on Ottawa  armed with a petition on Roll Back  Prices, that contained one million  signatures.

Many of us had established very  traditional relationships with men  before we became active and committed  feminists. Now we find it exceedingly difficult to integrate our  new ideals into our old lifestyles,  yet we do not accept that we must  choose between feminism and our  relationships with the men in our  lives. Therefore we are forming  a group which will devote itself  exclusively to finding positive  solutions to our problems in our  domestic situations.

CHILEAN WOMEN  The June 19th Chilean Women's  Night was terrific! They transformed our downstairs room by  hanging Chilean weavings, blankets  and posters all over the walls  and bookshelves and covering  all the chairs with throws. The  words and songs they shared with  us were so moving and meaningful -  these women have really got it all  together. And the food - estupendo!  Cheese and meat filled empanadas,  delicious cookies and a super  punch.  You will be interested  to know that the group is holding  a cultural festival on July 12  at the Unitarian Church (49th &  Oak).. Tickets are $3 each , call  us for the phone number. They also  publish a newsletter "Venceremos"  (means we will conquer) available  from the Vancouver Chilean Ass'n,  P.O. Box 48474, P.S. Bentall  Centre, Vancouver.  The next issue of KINESIS will  outline in more detail ways we  can all work together to aid the  women in Chile, and the Chilean  women in Vancouver. Meanwhile,  DO NOT BUY any Chilean wine, grapes  or onions as the purchasing of  those products only supports  the present junta regime.  Finally we have some good news  regarding the "$1,000 tax-free  interest" clause outlined in our  April Letter Lobby column. You  will recall that we were very  concerned because women who worked  only in the home and had no  taxable income would not be able  to take advantage of this new  tax benefit. And indeed this was  the case in 1974 - the May  Budget (before the election) had  not made allowances for housewives to be included.  However, due to pressure from  women across the country, the  "oversight" was apparently  rectified in the November 1974  budget.  I'm sure Mr. Dan  McKenzie's raising the question  in the House on January 31, 1975  and the Letter Lobby follow-up,  also helped.  In a letter to  responses  myself dated April 15, 1975,  Finance Minister John Turner  stated:  "Because the new provision  was introduced so late in the  year it was not practicable to  apply it to the 1974 taxation  year."  Senate Leader Ray Perrault also  responded to our telegram in  a letter dated April 7. He had  consulted with Revenue Minister  Ron Basford, who stated:  "I am pleased to report  that Bill C-49 (the tax bill),  in its final form, contains  a provision providing relief  to the problem presented by  Mrs. Holme."  So, if you have interest income  in excess of the $334 allowed  you as your husband's "dependent",  please be sure to consult a tax  expert in order to get the maximum  benefit. Unless you receive over  $1,000, your husband's married  status will not be affected.  In addition, you may earn the  $334 from other sources.  I firmly believe that without  pressure from groups like ours,  coupled with an alert M.P.,  this benefit might not now be  part of our income tax law  (subsection 110.1(6) of the  Income Tax Act). We must be  constantly alert - so keep your  eyes and ears open. Then take  appropriate action!  Dorothy Holme Kaslo     festival  It was MUCH too early on the  -morning of Friday June 13th when  Diana Bissell, Leslie Dixon and I  left Vancouver for the Western  Canadian Women's Festival being  held in Kaslo, B.C. Our dedication  to the spreading of the word of the  VSW managed to pull us out of bed  shortly after 5 am however, and we  were on the road by 6.  After a long drive (which featured  a non-stop CR-like discussion) through  ever changing and always beautiful  countryside, we finally arrived in  Kaslo about 5 pm. The festival officially began on Friday, with most of  the set-up and settling in taking place  then, so we withdrew to the camp grounds |  located about three miles away.  Setting^  up Leslie's enormous tent was our first  project, and while Diana pounded tent  pegs with the axe (wounding herself  only occassionally), Les and I tried  to figure out which tent poles belonged with which—they all looked  alike to me, but her experience pulled  us through. We headed back to the  festival after a marvellous supper  which restored our energy (we ate  royally through all four days), and  sat around a huge fire on the beach  with a large group of women, talking,  and singing along on the rare occasion  when we knew what was being sung.  Kaslo is on Kootenay Lake, which is  surrounded by heavily forested snowcapped mountains—an impressive and  beautiful place—which seems especially  so to someone who grew up in suburban  Toronto (like me).  The festival was very well organized,  with enough structured activities for  those who wished them, and lots of  unstructured things for -those who  didn't. Activity centred around an  outdoor stage where the entertainment was continuous, and a huge  canvas tent lent for the occasion by  a musical group delicately known as  "Brain Damage".  (I'm sure no correlation was made...)  It was the area  for browsing, and where we set up the  VSW exhibit with all our give-away  what was happening, and taking part—  in things like men's consciousness  raising groups.  The prevailing feelings during the  festival were ones of support and  friendship, helped by the knowledge  that everyone was seeing old friends,  making new ones, learning, and just  having a good time.  and resource material,~as well as our  T shirts, posters, publications, and  postcards for sale. Response was  great—also in the tent were women  from the Ad Company, Everywoman's  Books, the IWY van, the Vancouver  Health Collective and various  craftswomen selling everything from  plants, pottery, and incredible homemade "natural ingredient" pies, to  art work, jewellry and clothing.  A wide range of workshop topics were  offered each day starting at ten and  running all afternoon.  The topics  included auto mechanics, bush cooking, women in politics, lesbian  women, the history of the women's  movement, women in China, medical  self-help, experiencing strength  through one's body, layout and design, and different types of dancing and expression.  The place was always swarming with  kids, and I understand that the free  day care provided was excellent. The  first two days of the festival were  restricted to women only, while act-  ivites on Sunday and Monday were open  to men as well. An encouragingly  large number of men showed up, and  seemed for the most part to be supportive, and interested in both seeing  Rita Mac Neil was the highlight of  the festival.  She is an incredibly  gifted singer and song-writer who  awed everyone by singing with no  accompaniment. Her music is all very  memorable and quite beautiful, but  her becoming the focus of the festival  was mostly due to her lyrics, which  deal for the most part with the  problems that provoked her involvement  in the women's movement, and the  continuing frustration and joy it  brings her.  She and her songs  touched everyone (with titles like  "The War of Conditioning" "Tell  it Like it is (sister)" "Need for  Restoration" and "Born a Woman"),  and created an atmosphere of real  excitement, joy, optimism, and  faith.  She helped make the Western  Canadian Women's Festival a fulfillment of all the best things  that such a title implies.  -Leslie McDonald  Photos by Leslie McDonald  fight    for power  Women must get out and fight for  positions of power, rather than waiting to be invited into the power e-  lite, according to Joan Wallace, of  Delta, a member of the federal government's Advisory Council on the Status  of Women.  Speaking to the provincial convention of the Business and Professional  Women's Club in Victoria Saturday  evening, she said that women are  proving themselves capable in all  kinds of professional, business and  political fields, but they have  stopped short of getting into the  top policy-making positions in soc*  iety.  "We organize the women's auxiliary  to the hospital, but how many of us  try for an appointment to the hos*»  pital board where the real decisions  on mediaal care in the community are  made?" she asked.  "We run all kinds of women's voluntary and professional associations,  such as the Business and Professional Women, with great efficiency, but  how many women are getting into male  dominated community organizations,  such as the Chamber of Commerce, and  fighting for the top positions there?"  Ms. Wallace asked.        (  "Until we overcome the feminine conditioning that has trained us to  wait to be invited to everything—  our first date, to dance, to get  married—we will never achieve equality" she said.  "The same applies in the business  world," Ms. Wallace said.  "Men don't  sit around coyly waiting to be asked  to apply for a new management position or training course. They march  right in and tell the boss they're  ambitious and want to be considered  for these appointments. Women must  do the same if we ever expect to get  out of the low-paying, low-level  jobs in which we have been pigeonholed."  Commenting on the convention theme  "equality with responsibility" Ms.  Wallace said, "No social group in  our history, or in the history of  any other country, has had their liberation handed to them on a platter.  If we want equality, we must take  the responsibility for winning it  ourselves."  "This is particularly true in the  political arena," Ms. Wallace said.  "Women are begging, pleading, demanding, that our male legislators change  laws thfifecting women, but we haven't  yet realized that even if those laws  were changed tommrrow we would still  not have equality. That will come  only when women are represented in  government in such numbers that they  can control the laws affecting our  lives." -Sexism, Schools & Society  The project "Sexism, Schools and Society", sponsored by the Provincial  Advisory Committee on Sex Discrimination, began this month with two workshops in the self-selected school  districts of Trail and North Vancouver. These areas will be the scene  of a summer long pilot project, funded by the Department of Education.  The projects are designed to involve  people from the educational system,  parents and students in the process  of identifying, exploring and hopefully finding solutions to discriminatory attitudes and practices in  the public schools. The Sex Discrimination Committee plans to recommend  to Minister Eileen Dailly that the  projects be extended to other school  districts in British Columbia.  •trail  Trail: June 14—"The Hidden Curriculum" was described by project director  Cynthia Flood, as a day to discover  the values, images and options assigned to the roles of girls and bous,  men and women in our schools and our  society. A day to look at chances,  changes, challenges for young people.  A day to say what do we want for the  future? Workshops covered counselling, the Woman's Kit, Sex Roles in  textbooks, and the socialization of  children. Reva Dexter, special advisor to the Minister of Education,  was keynote speaker. Nadine Allen,  VSW staff Education Person, helped  conduct Workshops.  Nadine Allen  north Vancouver  North Vancouver: June 13 (evening) &  June 14 (all day)—Approximately 80  parents, teachers, students and members of the community concerned about  the nature of sexism and how it operates in our society and schools  attended the workshop.  After listening to speakers Dorothy  Smith, UBC Sociology Department, and  Linda Shuto, BCTF Status of Women  Program, and meeting for small group  discussions Friday evening, the  following overall statement of pur*  pose was drafted: "There is a need  for parents, teachers, and students  to realize their collective power  "and accept the responsibility for  changing the school system; and to  organize together to eliminate sexism."  Based on this statement, and the  ideas which came out of the discussion groups, five issue-oriented working groups were established with a  contact person nominated from each.  The working groups are listed below  with the names and numbers of the  contact persons.  If you live on  the North Shore and would like to  become involved in finding solutions  to the discriminatory attitudes and  practices in your schools and society,  get in touch with the contact person  of the group you are most interested  in.  Student Committee—Ramona Materi  929-2967  Parent Committee—Mary Catherine  Patterson 985-9217  Task Force on Texts, Courses, Curriculum and Resources—Susan MacLeod  929-5081  Task Force on Women in Media on the  North Shore—Del White 929-2689  Co-ordinating Committee to act as  a clearing house for the activities  of the other groups and made up of  the contact person from each of the  other groups as well as representatives from Coordinating Taskforce,  CUPE Local 389 Women's Co., Capilano  College Women's Steering Co., and  North Shore Women's Centre.  Rita Chud was Project Director of  this very successful (not to mention  exciting, enjoyable, and exhausting!)  workshop.

So,  indeed, has the study of Canadians.  Both have suffered from the same  kind of self-deprecation; both have  been socially and economically  supressed.  Women have been written out of our  history. To change this, they must  be given the same kind of conscious  attention that is being gradually  accorded to Native peoples, to the  poor and to immigrants.  Our curricula must give women special consideration until this attention leads to  their incorporation as an integral  part of our culture and curricula.  It would seem ridiculous to have  courses on the history of men or the  sociology of men because it is men  who set the norm; special attention  to the male is merely redundant in  a male-dominated society. Women's  studies will be necessary until the  place of women in our society is  equal to that of men.  Our commitment must be translated  into precise activities. Our work  must tfke many forms including delv- •  ing into attics, recording oral history, rewriting books, analysing  statistical data, and, yes, for the  time being, establishing special  courses and programmes about women  and by women. At each step we must  ask ourselves: What was woman's role?  Why was their role so defined? Why  have they been omitted? We must do  systematic research and develop a  social theory of women. Women's  studies can be an anachronism to  the next generation if we do our  work today!  - Sherrill Ceda, reprinted from  Communique: Canadian Studies  why not?!  A Women's Studies Course for Secondary Schools was initially prepared  by Vancouver Status of Women in January 1974. At that time the BCTF  printed the course and requested that  the Minister of Education include it  as an elective course in the provincial curriculum. The Minister rejected this course and made provisions  for revisions to be done. Two people  were given a very modest sum by the  Department to do the revisions. On  June 6, 1975, the revised course was  presented to the Minister and again  rejected. Her suggestion was that  sections of the course be incorporated into existing curricula* This  stance seems to be contradictory to  the Minister's previous viewpoint on  women's studies courses. As recently as November 1974 a press release  from her stated,"There is obviously  a need for a-women's studies course  in our Reboots. and it is desirable  that an integrated educationally  sound course be developed as a model  suitable for school districts in the  province."  The Minister's specific criticisms  of the course also lead one to question whether or not she is committed  to the implementation of any Women's  Studies Courses.  For example, she  suggests that historians will be  offended because the course states  that history has been written from  a male point of view and has omitted  contributions made by women. Secondly  she commented that we should not  assume that language is sexist and  we might be in danger of offending  linguists who know ever so much more  about how language developed than  we do. Thirdly, she objected to the  inclusion of alternatives to the  nuclear family (e.g. communal living)  and she suggested that people would  believe that we were opposed to mar-e  riage.  We believe that one of the reasons  the Minister rejected the course is  because of public criticism that was  mounted in the past. This criticism  was mainly directed toward a section  on religion which has since been  omitted. We would like to demon*  strate to the Minister and to the  public at large that there is strong  public support of women's studies  courses. We will be keeping you informed on what action will be taken  and how you can be involved. media action  The following letter was written to  protest an ad which was seen in Chatelaine Magazine.lt was directed to the .  Advertising Sales Manager and copies  were sent to the Editor of the magazine, the Manufacturers of the prot-  duct and the B.C. Human Rights Commission.  We are also printing a reply from the  Chairperson of the B.C. Human Rights  Commission so that you can see that  they too are concerned with sexism in  advertising.  Several members have been offended by  this particular ad and have drawn our  attention to it. They have seen the  ad in places other than Chatelaine  such as T.V. and in other publications. If you have seen the ad and do  not like the Lolita image of women it  conveys, direct your letter to the  appropriate place. But remember to  send copies to the manufacturer and  the Human Rights Commission.  Chatelaine Magazine  481 University Avenue  Toronto, Ontario  Attention: Advertising Sales Manager,  R. Hart  Dear Sir:  Re: Love's Baby Soft Ad  I recently subscribed to Chatelaine  because I was pleased with its apparent evolution from a homemaker's magazine into a women's magazine with a  broader perspective.  I am particularly pleased with the larger portion of  Chatelaine which is devoted to feminist material. While not proclaiming itself to be a women's movement  magazine, it is nevertheless getting  our message across clearly and in a  non-threatening manner to Canadian  wives, mothers and working women.  However I must take issue with some  of Chatelaine's ads which like the  one above, I feel contradict the tone  of Chatelaine and hence give it a  schizophrenic character.  I parties,  ularly object to Love's Baby Soft ad  because of the title "because innocence is sexier than you think."  It is not only ads which show a lot  of female flesh which are sexist in  nature, Ads which reinforce female  stereotypes in less obvious but more  insidious ways, such as this one, are  equally sexist. The theme of this ad  is that "men love us for our vunerab-  ility." This ad reinforces the image  of women as babies, helpless sweet  things. May I remind you that helpless women in the end become victims.  I was very disappointed to see this  little girl image in a magazine for  adult women.  If we are to remain  sexually innocent, we are never to be  fulfilled. I ask you who benefits from  this situation, men of course. Once  again we are encouraged by this ad  to be placed at a disadvantage be  cause of our sex.  The B.C. Human Rights Commission has  publically stated that while such ads  are not in violation of the law, they  are contrary to the spirit of the Human Rights Code. We ask you if you  would publish similar ads with a racial tone. Why then are sexist ads  acceptable to Chatelaine?  On behalf of 800 members of the Vancouver Status of Women and its Media  Action Committee, I ask you to withdraw this ad from Chatelaine until  such time as it appeals to the eons- .  sumer in non-sexist terms eg. that it  is simply good at keeping skin soft  and smells good. We hope Chatelaine  will act in a socially responsible  manner on this issue, and we would  appreciate your reply. Thank you  Karen Richardson  Media Action group, VSW  cc.

Even the weather  cooperated—while it didn't actually  smile on us, it didn't actually rain  on us either. As much as can be asked of West Coast weather.  Merran and John Twigg provided their  farm in Saanich and close to 100  people turned out to support Rosemary Brown and generally enjoy themselves. Macrame hangings complete  with potted plants and candles hung  from trees in the orchard and there  was_?ottery and jewelry and food and  drink; for sale. A woman played a  dulcimer and sang folk songs and  there was a puppet show for the kids  (of all ages) in which a frog lamented that because of her deep voice  she was always being mistaken for a  male. What could she do^ One suggestion from a young member of the audi-  ance was that she could "carry a  purse with a lipstick and some eyebrows in it."  There was a film on Indian Land  Claims, and Rosemary gave a talk, and  your loyal editor could have won a  prize for colouring her poster if she  hadn't misplaced it and her crayons  in the grass while fetching more refreshments. The day wound up with a  giant weiner and marshmallow roast.  A good day!  Rosemary Brown Day  -Photo by Don Young  members  forum  men's liberation  Very soon we shall be inundated with  a series of community beauty pageants  leading up to the "Miss P.N.E." extravaganza. Photographs of women  posing in bathing suits with their  'prize ribbons' pinned across their  chests will deluge the pages of the  local papers.  As a woman, I am truly concerned with  the continuing exploitation of women  in such contests.  Surely this "wholesale grading of flesh" can only perpetrate the myth that a woman should  win her place through promoting her  physical attributes.  The winner conforms to an extremely  sexist ideal while the losers feel  inadequate in not meeting the standard—set by whom?!  Consider a comparable contest for  men—quite ludicrous of course!  What man would demean himself? It  is assumed to be just fine however  for women.  Isn't it about time women stopped  supporting their own exploitation  by entering or sponsoring beauty  pageants?  Perhaps the media action group might  have some ideas on trying to raise  the consciousness of the people involved in organizing these affairs.  I realize most of us would not support these contests but unfortunately  there are many out there who will.  As they continue on—a giant step  backward for women's liberation!  Carole Sinclair  CONFERENCE ON MEN'S LIBERATION  A national conference on Men's Liberation is in the planning stages. The  purpose is to provide an opportunity  for men to share their experience in  consciousness-raising, to allow further examination of traditional male  roles, and to create an outlet for  expressing the frustration felt by  many men in the face of changing lifestyles. As well, it is hoped that a  network of communication might be  established amongst men across Canada  interested in these issues, perhaps  in the form of a newsletter or a central registry of consciousness-raising  groups.  The conference is tentatively proposed for the first weekend in October,  1975 from Friday evening, October 3  to Sunday afternoon, October 5, on  the Campus of Waterloo University,  Waterloo, Ontario. Further notice  will be mailed out fehen plans are  finalized.  The format will include discussions  led by speakers prominent in the field  of male psychology, as well as workshops conducted in smaller groups.  Some of the topics proposed for the  workshop discussions are: Sexism,  Men and Work, Sexuality, Man and Children, and Men and Emotionalism.

The problem of Executive domination  arises in most groups, and it is one  that is difficult to avoid!  Especially as so many members are quite  willing to leave everything to a President or Executive.  That is my experience in many long years of belonging  to groups.  It is difficult to teach the "rank  and file" to put forward ideas and  take responsibility. However,it seems  to me from reading Kinesis that you  are more engaged in activity all together, as it were.  You are probably younger, most of you,  and less tainted with the old bureaucratic philosophy!  I have found that, even in socialist  groups, there was the tendency, sometimes, towards a top heavy leadership.  Leaders are a menace, the betterthey  are the greater the menace. They get  followers and followers stop thinking.  In the latter days of the CCF independent thinking was frowned on.  So good luck to you—co-operate and  change your officers often.  Eve Smith  Kinesis:  Thank you for the excellent article  on Rosemary Brown in your May issue  of Kinesis.  Now could we have an article on Flora  MacDonald?  (Kinesis note: Thanks to  our trusty P.O. this 'letter was  written before the Flora MacDonald  article in the June issue was written and received well after the June  issues were printed. Good thing we  rely heavily on feminine intuition!)  I would like to see Kinesis support  women in politics for all parties. I  appreciated your forum on women for  the city elections.  Could Kinesis continue to encourage  women to take part in all levels of  government including local.government  in the small and not. so small towns  of B.C.?  Thank you for your excellent and stimulating Kinesis.  Dorothy I. Behneke  (Kinesis asks members all over the  province to please send in information on women who are active in your  community so we can print it in your  newspaper.)  There's many a thing that men can't do  (Child-bearing's only one);  But that won't stop their telling you  Just haw it should be done. ;  - G.B. Riddehough  Kinesis,  Dear Friends:  At the May 28th meeting to vote on  amendments to the constitution some  attitudes were expressed that really  concerned me. The inclusion of four  members of the staff selected by the  staff to be on the executive was seen  by a few people as an "unbusinesslike" procedure and dangerous since  the staff could dominate it—rather  ' than as simple changes in the constitution to reflect what was, in reality,  happening, i.e. that the staff was doing the jobs, (which required people  full-time) therefore, the executive  positions were only empty titles. This  was creating confusion for both the  staff and the executive about their  functions and responsibilities.  Another attitude expressed, when the  amendment to have more signing officers was discussed,- was that trust  should be invested in a title, not a  person, i.e. if the treasurer signs  the cheques everything is bound to be  okay because she's got the proper  title, but if anyone else does, who  knows what could happen.  It seems to me that as a "feminist"  organization we should be trying to  change the hierarchical structure of  bosses and servants that operates in  the business world. Rather than viewing staff as servants to carry out our,  the members' bidding, directed and  supervised by the executive, we should  be trying to work together in a coop*-  erative, egalitarian way. This recognizes the fact that the staff has as  much of an investment in the organization as do the volunteers as well as  bringing a great deal of practical experience of its running to the executive. It requires that we do what we  can to help rather than simply criticize by doing our part to ensure our  points-of-view are represented by:  running for office, supporting candidates that we feel could do the best  job and voting with care.  Speaking  out at general meetings and contributing to Kinesis, whether.by writing a  letter-to-the-editor or by writing an  article are other ways of communicat-t  ing our feelings and ideas on issues  with the general membership and the  staff.  It also means that we believe  in the loyalty and trustworthiness of  the people hired to work for the   *  accomplishment of our shared goals.  Sincerely,  Betty-Ann Buss  Kinesis: re June 1975 issue  Dear Ladies:  Last night a group of  friends was discussing the above issue of your paper, in particular your  disgusting headline on p.3 "Pissed  Off". We unanimously took umbrage  with your gutter language!I!I!  Your "moble thoughts" on very controversial subjects (incidently), should  at least be expressed in acceptable  English.  Your movement, like the IWY, deserves  to fizzle if you deliberately denigrate  a potentially important cause.  Sincerely yours,  Mary J. Clay Letters  cont'd...  Dear Kinesis:  I recently heard some information from  a friend that I thought should get a  bit of publicity.  She recently had ■  her fourth child and, about 3 months  after the birth thought she was preg*-  nant again.  She decided she would be  unable to handle another baby then,  and, rather than make the rest of her  children suffer through her inability  to cope, felt that the only way out  of the situation was an abortion. Now  to me the real zinger in the whole situation is that she nearly got pregnant  because her doctor, a qualified medical man, told her she didn't need to  bother with birth control while she  was nursing because she could not get  pregnant! She was lucky because she  was not pregnant, but my point is that  with medical misinformation being handed out by supposed informed parties,  there is certainly need for legalized  abortions.  I just hope that this little tidbit can  be passed on so that more people can  realize that doctors do not always know  best.  I have not been, up to now, too  sure about the abortion issue, but this  incident has helped me make up my mind.  I certainly don't see why she should  have to bear and care for another child  merely because her doctor doesn't know  the facts of life!  Yours truly,  Chris Wozney  errata  On page 20 of the June issue of  KINESIS the last word in the third  paragraph of the column headed  IMPORTANT should read"deleted" not  "elected".  On May 16, a letter outlining the  VSW Executive's reasons for supporting the proposed amendments to the  constitution was mailed to all members of the VSW.  Some members had  requested more information about the  issues to be discussed at the May  28th meeting and the letter was an  attempt to provide that information.  During the first two weeks of June,  the VSW office received a great many  phone calls from members who were  puzzled or irate (or both) about the  fact that they had just received  their letter!  In fact many of them  pointed out that their letters were  postmarked June 3! Puzzled and  irate ourselves, we contacted the  Post Office. Following is a reply  to our inquiry.  Dear Ms. Lazenby:  Further to your letter of June 5 and  my subsequent telephone call June 9,  I am providing you with a written explanation as requested.  Let me first say that the Canada Post  Office regrets the inconvenience occasioned as a result of this poor delivery service. Hopefully incidents such  as this will not be repeated in the  future.  As you are probably aware, our postal systems have been rather inefficient in recent months due to the bitter labour-management negotiations that  still appear deadlocked.  Several of  the major mail distribution cnntres  have been the targets for slow-downs,  work-to-rule campaigns and illegal  strikes. B.C. was one of the hardest  hit districts because Vancouver's  ,main processing plant handles the  greatest portion of mail coming into  and going out of the province.  When slowdowns or stoppages occur, it  can take several weeks to recover  lost production time.  At the probable  time of receipt of your notices, Vancouver was deluged with incoming first  class items only, our staffs were not  able to attend to any third class  matter at that time.  Consequently,  while the first class mail stream was  being cleared, a second backlog was  created out of the accumulating pile  of third class and printed matter.  Unfortunately, Vancouver's manpower  budget was already overspent for the  previous month and only a handful of  extras could be hired on to help  clear the backlog. Naturally some  staggering delays in the receipt of  local third class items were reported.  It may yet be some time before our  operations resume a normal standard  of service. Until some stability is  achieved, I strongly suggest that you  avoid sending out communication with  a time value at the third class rate.  I wish that we could provide a refund  in this case, but regulations set down  in the Post Office Act, Section 42,  provide for refund of postage on lost  items only.  Since these notices were  eventually delivered, no reimbursement  can be claimed.  I hope that this explanation will be  satisfactory to your enquiry.  In  closing, I would like to offer our  sincerest apologies.  Yours truly,  R.J. Crompton  Customer Service Section  j u ly  CALENDAR OF EVENTS  JULY 2 - C.A.R.A.L. Abortion Group  7:30 pm office.
