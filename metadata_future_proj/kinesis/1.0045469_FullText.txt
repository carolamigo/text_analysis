 kinesi  Alice James  1339 West 5Sth Ave  VANCOUVER 14, *.C.  MAY              1975  PfAlPPY   I.VUNT 7£5 '  Vancouver Statue of NAtamen  ^3SS W.;: Fourth A/e.  "738-3746-7-0  VbkjmsV    No.42  It has become apparent that the Constitution of the Vancouver Status of Women needs to be amended.  The Constitution was originally designed to meet the needs of an organization that depended entirely on volunteer labour.  Vancouver Status of Women has grown enormously since the time the original Constitution was drafted and many duties that were formerly performed by executive -members as  volunteer work are now being done by the office staff.  The present Constitution, which provides  for elected executive positions whose duties must, of necessity, be performed by office staff members has become unwieldy and no longer serves the.needs of VSW.  The proposed amendments are in  keeping with the growth of VSW and would provide better representation on the executive of the  people involved in the daily work of the organization and would also provide flexibility in meeting the needs of the organization as they arise.  The regular executive meeting to be held on the fourth Wednesday in May  (May 28) has been designated by the President as a business meeting for  all members.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MEETING AND IT IS ESSENTIAL  THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM IN ORDER TO VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.  If we do not amend the Constitution at this meeting, the VSW General  Elections in June will have to be held under the present Constitution and  the existing problems will continue for another year.  The Board of Directors intends to submit to the membership at the  special General Meeting on May 28,1975, the following extraordinary  resolution:  BE IT RESOLVED THAT the By-  Laws of Vancouver Status of Women  be amended as follows:  1) Article IV, Section I - Elected  Officers shall be deleted and substituted therefor shall be a new  Article IV, Section I - Officers as  follows:  "a) Elected officers shall be: President, Vice-President, Secretary,  Treasurer, six members-at-large.  b) In addition there shall be four  appointed officers, selected from amongst  the employees of the society by the said  employees. One of the said appointed  officers shall be the Ombudswoman.  The remainder shall be members-at-  large."  2) Article IV, Section II - Qualifications, Subsection b shall be deleted  and the following subsection substituted  therefor:  "b) Be nominated for office with the  exception of the four appointed officers.  3) Article IV, Section III - Nominations shall be deleted and the following new Article IV, Section III - Nominations substituted therefor:  "a) Ninety days prior to the annual  general meeting a Nominating Committee  shall be formed composed of three members. At least one of such members  shall be a member of the Board of Directors and all three members shall be  selected by the Board of Directors.  All three shall hold office until the  annual general meeting.  b) The Nominating Committee shall:  1) Invite suggestions for any  office from individual members in good  standing.  2) Prepare a list of one or more  candidates for each office for presentation at the annual general meeting.  3) Determine the eligibility of  members nominated.  c) Nominations, may be made in  either of the following manners:  1) By the Nominating Committee.  2) From the floor at the general meeting immediately prior to the  annual general meeting.  d) Only members nominated shall be  eligible for election and those members shall have given their consent  to nomination.  e) Vacancies occuring during a  term of office shall be filled by  special election outlined in Article  IV, Section VII - Vacancies and following submission of names of eligible  nominees to the Board of Directors."  4) Insert immediately following Article  IV, Section III - Nominations a new  Article IV, Section Ilia - Selection  of Appointed Officers as follows:  "The employees of the society shall  select four of their number to be ap  pointed to the Board of Directors at  least fourteen days before the date  of the annual general meeting and  shall declare those selected at the  commencement of election proceedings  at the said annual general meeting."  5) Change the title of Article V -  Appointed Officers to Parliamentary  Procedure.  6) In Article VI, Section I - Composition insert the words "and appointed" immediately following the  word "elected."  7). Change the title of Article VII -  Duties of Elected Officers to Duties  of Officers.  8) In Article VII - Duties of Elected  Officers delete Section VI - public  Relations Officer, Section VII - Newsletter Officer, Section VIII Nominations  Officer, Section IX - Membership Co  ordinator and renumber Section X ■  Members-at-large as Section VI.  9) Delete Article III, Section II -  Signing Officers and substitute the  following new Article III, Section  II - Signing Officers therefor:  " Signing officers shall be the  President, Vice-President, Treasurer,  Secretary, and officers designated by  the Board of Directors. The signatures  of two signing officers shall be necessary to authorize disbursements."  ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 28,1975, A VERY IMPORTANT  BUSINESS MEETING WILL BE HELD AT 7:30 P.M.  IN THE VANCOUVER STATUS OF WOMEN OFFICE,  2029 WEST 4th AVENUE, TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.  ALL MEMBERS ARE URGED TO ATTEND! , Engineering is a good career for  women — the jobs are there, the  salaries are good, and the satisfactions are concrete," said Dr. Irene  Peden* I picked -up my ears.  "Engineering is in the mainstream  of our technically oriented society  and women are not going to be left  standing outside the mainstream.  Engineering is one of the doors to  decision making positions."  Right on!  I was listening to Dr.  Irene Peden, Associate Dean of Engineering, University of Washington,  Seattle, Washington, and Keynote  Speaker at the Special Seminar on  Women in Engineering. When VSW was  asked to co-sponsor the Seminar,along  with the B.C. Department of Highways,  the Association of Professional Engineers of B.C., the Faculty of Applied Science,of UBC, and the Office  of the Dean of Women of UBC, my  knowledge of and interest in engineering were about equal — pushing zero. Which shows what ignorance  will do for you. After listening  to Dr. Peden for a few minutes I  was astounded — and angry. Where  was all this stuff when I was at  University? Well, in 1959, it was  there allright, but I was sitting  in a room reading Keats with a lot  of other young women who, like me,  Were not too sure why, but i't was  7/10 of 1% of the engineers in the  USA were women.  However, in the last couple of years  there has been a nation-wide escalation of women entering engineering  and interest in this field as a  career for women is rising here in  B.C. as well.  In a telephone conversation with Dr. Ernie Peters,  Professor of Metallurgy, UBC, I asked how fast it is rising and learned  that there are two women in this  year's graduating class, and there  will be at least two next year.  There are also 13 first year women  engineering students. There are  about 300 first year engineering  students altogether, but this is  still an enormous increase when you  consider that the number of women  in first year engineering at UBC  over the last 26 years has averaged  out at one per year! Of the 13 women now in first year, Dr. Peters  says that, barring accidents, he  expects to see at least 12 graduate.  Out of the same number of male first  year students, he* estimates that  about nine or ten would be expected  to carry on to graduation. The  reason — for a woman to choose engineering at the present time in our  society shows a great deal of determination — she has probably made the  does not lead then to think of a  career in a traditionally male-dominated field such as engineering.  Parental guidance, schools, peer  interests and pressures all help to  reinforce this socialization. Young  females just are not made aware of  the choices that they should have  in determining what to do with their  lives.  Marg Grant, Co-ordinator ofi Counselling, Vancouver School Board, notes  that many students come from families  that do not think in terms of careers  for women;   so the daughters are  'not encouraged in this direction.  Madeline Dent, of SFU Counselling  Service, says that personal contact  is important in a student's early  years when ideas about careers are  starting to form. They are influenced by someone they respect or who  has encouraged them or who serves  as a role model.  But if young women don't know such  people personally, how do they learn  about the opportunities open to them?  There are Career Days — usually with  a male 'example of a career'. There  are brochures and other kinds of information available — if they know  u  omen   in    engineering  a "good liberal education" and anyway you could always teach it to  somebody else if you ever needed to  work. There is nothing wrong in reading Keats, but there is something  wrong in-not being aware of what  other choices there are. When you're  female and from a small town in the  Interior, in the 1950's going off  to University was choice enough!  Dr. Peden spoke of the "beauty of  an orderly and functional way of  thinking" that she discovered in a  high school chemistry class.  She  had been intending to pursue a career  in music and discovered her affinity  for science quite by accident.  Fortunately, she had supportive teachers  and counsellors who encouraged her.  She was considered a "social deviant"  but when she enrolled in the University of Colorado in electrical engineering she found there were 30  women taking engineering. This was  during World War II, and new career  opportunities were opening up for  women. After graduation there was  some difficulty getting a job, —  '%e've nevdr had a woman engineer,"  etc  Finally Dr. Peden got a job  at a university (that had been turned down by several males because of  the conditions and salary). And now,  almost 30 years later in her present  position at the University of Washington, she has the satisfaction of  seeing women both in the student body  and on the teaching staff of the  Faculty of Engineering.  Dr. Peden trained as an engineer in  the 1940's — it must be better now.  Not really. The door-opening 40!s  were followed by the 50's — remember  the deadening 50*s? The University  of Colorado never again had 30 women  in engineering and two years ago only  decision on her own and perhaps in  spite of counselling, and social  and parental disapproval.  She is  highly motivated and self-disciplined. As for her employment opportunities, Dr0 Peters agrees that there  has been discrimination in the job  market but, he says, it is waning.  He feels that the present job market  can aborb a rate of 20% female engineers — and we certainly don't  have anywhere near that number.  The standard uninformed image of an  engineer as a hefty man directing  heavy construction on a half-completer*  ed dam is a very narrow one. The  range encompassed by engineering is  vast and includes agricultural and  biological engineering, chemical,  electrical, geological, mechanical,  civil, metallurgical, and mineral  engineering, and engineering physics.  The work ranges from design and res  searclj, to environmental control, to  computer systems, to mining, to technical sales, to project work.  Something for everybody.  The why aren't there more women engineers? Part of the blame rests  with the engineering profession and  faculty themselves. They have not  publicized engineering as a career  and the enrollment of students in engineering is dropping.  In B.C. the  per capita enrollment in engineering  school is one-half of that in Alberta.  Attempts are now being made to remedy  •this — a UBC brochure on engineering  urges women "who have an aptitude for  mathematics and science to consider  an engineering career," and assures  them that "a significant increase  in their participation in the pro*  fession is long overdue0" The socialization that females have traditionally undergone in our society  to ask for them. They are told by  the schools that "today nothing is  impossible" — but young women today  need to be told what is possible.  Both Dr. Peters and Dr. Donald Moore,  Head of Electrical Engineering,UBC,  feel that High School counsellors  are faulty in not actively encouraging more female students to pursue  careers such as engineering. They  are members of the High School Visitation Program initiated by Dr. Peters,  and have visited approximately 20  High Schools in the last two years.  In one instance at a High School in  Vancouver, Dr. Moore talked to a  group of Grade 11 and 12 students  about careers in engineering. When  he expressed surprise later that there  had been no female students present,  the counsellor replied that they  didn't think girls would be interested.  This comment reminded he of an essay  by Shirley Chisholm in which she  stated that "young girls are programed by high school counsellors into  a field where their 'natural' career  — housewife and mother — won't be  interferred with." Ms. Chisholm  likened this to the practice of advising young blacks to prepare for  service oriented occupations — no  thought of professions. This is not  happening so much anymore because the  young blacks have been radicalized  and no longer accept this channeling  and the society is becoming sensitized  to the damaging effects of racist  attitude's. It should be just as  sensitized to the damaging effects  of sexist attitudes!  Linda Shuto, Executive Assistant for  the Status of Women Program, BCTF ,  continued on page 3 continued from page 2  says much the same thing/ "Our society needs someone in low paying  ]obs and women are the easiest group  to place there. Women must refuse  to be exploited this way. They must  stop the *channeling process'."  Dr. Peters believes that the women's  movement has already done a great  deal towards making both women and  society as a whole aware of the fact  that women should be able to take  advantage of the same opportunities  as are available to men. In his  talks at schools he stresses that  engineering is an equally good field  for men and women.  By this time I had decided that I  would like to talk to some women engineers. Dan Lambert of the assoc~  iation of Professional Engineers of  B.C. gave me the names of the four  professional registered women engineers in B.C. and I was able to contact three of them. There was also  a list of 13 Engineers-in-Training  —women who have graduated from an  accredited university and are academically qualified and are now going  through their two years required experience (three years for graduates  from outside Canada).  The first of the professional engineers that I spoke to had received  her training as an electrical engineer in England in the 1940's.  Her father had been an engineer and  there had seemed nothing unusual about  her becoming one.  In fact women in  these types of professions were much  more common then and, in her opinion,  we have regressed in the period since..  The blame for this regression, she  feels, can be placed on "women's lib"  which has harmed women in professions  by over-emphasizing their existence  so that now men are questioning working with women. If the situation had  been left to take its natural course,  there would be many more women in  thess professions.  I felt a little discouraged but reminded myself that the women's movement had not really had much social  impact until the late 60's and that  the number of women in professions  had not grown by leaps and bounds  between the 40's and the 60's. So  natural progression had not done us  much good. I repeated the figures  Dr. Peters (one woman in engineering  at UBC every year between 1949 and  1970) and Dr. Peden (until two years  ago less than 1% of engineers in USA  were women) had given me under my  breath as I dialed the next woman.  The second woman I spoke to was also  an Electrical Engineer and was also  trained in Europe. She had graduated  from Zagreb University in Yugoslavia  in 1956 and had gone into engineerr-  ing because she was interested in  math and science. Her parents had  not really been in favour but there  was no other discouragement.-— her  marks were satisfactory and there  were many other girls taking the  same kind of training. As far as  she is concerned it is just another  profession and she knows several  women engineers who are working successfully in Switzerland and Germany.  When I spoke to the third woman on .  my list one of my growing suspicions  received some confirmation — it is  a little more acceptable to be a woman in electrical engineering than  in some other fields of engineering.  Erica Korbely graduated from university in Budapest, Hungary, as a Mechanical Engineer in 1966.  Before en-,  tering university she had obtained  a mechanic's degree and had worked  two years as a mechanic. After university graduation, she worked for  two years as a Mechanical Engineer  in Hungary designing deisel engines,  then for six months in Holland and  six months in the USA before coming  to Canada, After WWII, there were  more women than men in Hungary and  so women filled the jobs and professions formerly held by men. And,Erica  explained, Hungary is not a rich  country and women must be able to  support themselves, so if at all  possible, you prepare yourself for  a lifetime career that y>u will enjoy,  In Hungary 20% of the Engineers-in-  Training are women.  50% of the  dlectrical Engineers and 80% of the  Chemical Engineers are women. There  is nothing strange about being a woman and being an engineer.  Except in Canada there is something  strange about being- a woman engineer  Erica discovered. She worked for  three years for a small factory in  B.C. and found that nobody believed  she could really do the work as well  as a man.  So at first, she was paid  less''until she proved herself.'  For  the first year she was not treated  seriously — although she' had three  draftsmen working under her, sales  men refused to discuss business with  her; she was told by a business  appointment to send a man instead;  she was a handy source of 'humourous'  remarks. At one point in order to  get something done the way she requested it, she went to the machine  shop and worked the grinder machine  and welder herself.  By showing the  men that she had the practical knowledge as well as the theory, and  could actually teach them the way she  wanted the work done she won respect.  The second and third years were a  little better, but when she had worked in Hungary,__she had been accepted  as a professional engineer — she  hadn't been required to expend time  and energy proving she was 'as good  as a man.'  Ms. Korbely is not working jjuiitime  at the present — she does some consulting — as she has twin babies,  Hopefully, she will not have to go  through the process again of 'earning the right to practice her profession. '  The fourth professional engineer on  my list did not live in Vancouver,  and this was a disappointment as she  was the only one of the four who had  received her training in Canada (Al»<  berta) and I wished to compare her  experiences to those of the European  trained women. I decided to try one  of the engineers-in-training.  Sandra Haslin was one of two women  to graduate in Electrical Engineering from UBC in 1970.  I asked Sandra  why she had chosen Electrical Engineering andj she confirmed the fact  that it has been the more socially  acceptable field of engineering for  women — it is the field least associated with rough physical work and  there is a variety of positions in  electrons s and design.  There is  little similarity between Sandra's  • early school experience and that of  the women trained in Europe.  Sandra  received no career guidance and although she showed interest in Math  and Science in High School, she was  not told about the choices proficiency  in these subjects made available to  her.  She feels very strongly that  students should have all the choices  and alternatives presented to them  in an objective fashion so they can  make comparisons.  She feels that  the attitude that girls needn't be  that concerned about educational and  career choices because"they're just  going to get married anyway," is  still very common in our society.  When Sandra arrived at UBC in 1965,  she was not encouraged in her interest in Science — a male-dominated  field.  In fact she got the impression that she was "a little crazy."  Sandra worked part time in a computer  centre when she was in second year  -Science and could see no real choices  for herself in that direction.  So  she began to look around for something more practical and applied that  offered more career opportunities.  She settled on Engineering because  the science involved is basically  the same as in the Science courses  but instead of concentrating on defining problems, Engineering takes  problems and finds solutions.  Sandra  and another woman applied to transfer  into Electrical Engineering.  The  head of the department was very helpful and they were accepted into Second  year Engineering (with a couple of courses  to carry.) They experienced no problems with their all-male classmates.  Within three or four months after  graduation almost everyone of the 60  or 70 members of the graduating class  had been employed, including the two  women.  This article on Women in Engineering -  will be concluded in the June issue  of Kinesis. Although it focuses on  the situation of women in the engineering profession, this situation  is true of other male dominated fields  as well. Next month we will report on  some of the things that are being done  about the situation and some of the  things that we feel should be done.  ~ by Jo Lazenby in defense of women's  V  centres  Two years after the necessity of  women's centres was established by  the Western Conference/Opportunities  for Women, their existence is still  meeting with community resistance,  even in this International Women's  Year. The public controversy centres  on the need for and the "legitimacy"  of-volunteer lay services and their  support by the government;  Women's centres are providing services  to women precisely because others are  inadequate to meet the long ignored  needs of women, because existing services are sexist in bias and generally  inaccessible to women.  So long as  they are treated unequally by society,  women will require compensatory services . This does not make them  "special" or place them on another  "pedestal."  Providing feminist ombudservices,  communications, research on women's  status, educational-nonsexist material  and political expertise for women,  is not "busy work" or "do-gooding."  The staff of most women's centres are  well educated.  If not professtional,  neither are they "amateurs treating  guinea pigs'" as one critic termed it.  Active feminists are the only "experts"'  on the status of women and how to  improve it.  Such social services are not profit  making ventures.  Recognizing their  ever dependency on government funding,  women's centres nevertheless think  the government has a "responsibility"  to fund programmes beneficial to the  community.  In most cases, they are  paid the wages of file clerks.  Cheap  labour. But the community is under \  the impression the government is  spending vast sums on them.  Through history women have always  been in the vanguard providing social  services the government later decided  to institute "officially" or which  companies profited from to the detriment of the community eg. nursing  homes.  It is time women's centres got the  acknowledgement, recognition, credit,  support and long term core funding  they deserve.  ' ;,»&«!£__ ;v^. Karen Richardson  iwy     info vans  The vans are ready to roll!  Remember in the March issue of Kinesis  •we reported that the federal government had heeded the complaints of wo- .  men across the country regarding the  plans for four major conferences?  The  government decided instead to organize  more flexible programs suitable to the  needs of each province.  One of these  programs is a mobile information unit  to travel through B.C.  Lynne Pearson has been named B.C.  Coordinator of the International Women's Year Secretariat and will be  organizing the program in B.C.  Two  women — Shelia Purdy of the Vancouver  Status of Women, and Gillian Smith  of Everywoman's Bookstore in Victoria  — have been hired to drive a van  loaded, with goodies around the province. The two women go to Ottawa  for a five day training program May  1st, and the van should be ready to  set out after the first week in May.  They will spend five months travelling  from community to community, bringing  women* information about their rights  and opportunities. The van will contain a. film made by the Secretariat  —"Women Want" — a brief history of  the women's movement in Canada,, and  factual information on women's issues.  There will be other films, including  some of the National Film Board films  on working mothers, health, etc. There  will also be a slide presentation,and  seven Women's Kits so that some can  be borrowed by interested groups.  And of course lots of literature and  information on services of the federal  and provincial governments that are  available to women, as well as infor-  - mation on what women in other parts  of B.C. are doing.  The focus is on  reaching"those women who are not yet  "aware" but as Lynne Pearson points  out these women must be linked into  what is already happening with women  in B.C.  She also sees the mobile unit  as a great way to get women involved  in lobbying for the changes that are  so necessary.  The mobile unit hopes to co-ordinate  its travel schedule with the needs  and activities of the communities in  B.C. They need to know what materials and information each community  especially needs and if there is a  particular event scheduled that would  combine well with the appearance of  the van.  So they need input from the  communities themselves.  If you can  contribute such information please  contact Lynne Pearson as soon as possible: Lynne Pearson  B.C.

The Feminist News Service held their  policy and organization conference  in Winnipeg on March 27-31, 1975, to  establish a vechile for the communication of news concerning women's  issues to women across Canada.  Some  of the policies decided upon were that  F.N.S. will carry only Canadian material written by and about Canadians-  Quebecoises-Native Women.  Feminist  News Service will be bilingual.  Two  head offices for F.N.S. will be established.  The Eastern office which  serves for all of Canada until a Western office is decided upon, is F.N.S.,  25, Dupont Street, Waterloo, Ontario,  c/0 Katie Middleton. Two offices,  one for the West and one for the East,  were seen as an absolute necessity so  news for the West would not come back  with an Eastern slant.  It also would  lessen the work load as the two head  offices can gather and collate news,  etc. within their regions and exchange  between them.  There are regional-  provincial representatives whose task  it is to get together a conference of  the West within six months with the  goal of establishing the Western office. The Eastern office should be  putting out its first news packet within the next three months and subscription fees should be sent out by that  time.

From the newsletter, I ean see that  the work for equality goes on in  Canada.  International Women's Year  is proving to be both a frustrating  and a celebratory event. The Vancouver  Status of Women office is busy with  meetings, workshops and letter writing.  Slowly the change is coming.  It must be said (whether this is any  consolation or not) that Australia  is experiencing this same change,  but at a much slower pace than North  America.  For a person conscious of  sexism, life here is not too comfortable.  On the streets the passage of a female  (or a "Sheilah" as woman is known)  elicits more whistles, cat-calls and  ingenious forms of abuse than I have  ever heard in a Canadian, European  or Eastern city. Not only workmen,  but car salesmen, office workers, even  policemen delight in this sort of  vocalization.  It's no wonder that  Germaine Greer, an Australian, wrote  the "Female Eunuch"!  At the employment exchange "Youths  under 19" and "Women" are requested  to wait in one line and "Men" in  another.  ("Women and children first"?)  The classified advertisements are a  further indication of woman's role  in Australia. A dozen columns are  devoted to male jobs - "bright young  men sought", labourers, skilled  technicians. Half that number of  columns are then directed at "Women  and Girls", asking for barmaids,  waitresses, domestics and receptionists. There are perhaps three opportunities listed under a noh-sexist  "Situations Vacant" heading and these  are usually for couples.  When applying for a job the advice is  never wear slacks.  From my experience  it's to your advantage to be sixteen  and pretty, able to type and, I quote  one ad, "ready and willing to keep  our office happy".  Generally employers  want girls rather than women.  By law  anyone under 21 can be paid a lesser  salary and who wants an adult female  when a cheaper young "sheilah" can be  hired instead? These females are  channelled into "serving", "service"  and "house" jobs, the stereotyping  of the street wolf-whistle completed.  Advertising is much more sexist than  that endured in North America.  In this  beach-conscious country, girls in  bikinis are used to sell everything.  The newspapers unfailingly have several bathing-beauty photographs per  week. (Here is pretty Carla at City  Beach, enjoying her day off from work  as a receptionist with Mr. Brown's  Co. Nice tan Carla!")  As well, the papers have the traditional "woman's page" replete with  engagements and marriages, recipes  and fashions.  Sometimes (if you're  lucky) there's a "woman's issue"  article.  In January there was a  bonanza a series of three articles  on I.W.Y.  Yes, I'm afraid Australia is even  more a "man's world" than Canada is  at.this moment.  It's a place where  the sun-bronzed, t-shirted fellow -  beer can in hand and ogling the girl  fth prtAMkfi.  in platform shoes - is king.  That  particular girl being ogled has no  great opportunity on the job market  and from a heavy-handed socialization  doesn't desire much "opportunity anyways. You won't discover a great  deal about women in this real and  changing world by relying on the  communications media and, as elsewhere,  women's particular problems are not  at the top of government priority -  lists.  Yet despite the unfavourable situation,  .there is a growing and healthy female  consciousness.  I'ye been in contact  with the IWY co-ordinator in this  Australian state and have met other  concerned women. There's a good level  of activity and purpose, even though  the general level of awareness is low.  So, be thankful for Canadian advances -  and be hopeful that our Australian  sisters are following, however slowly,  to the same end.  - Barbara Tomlin  (Barbara worked at VSW last summer  on a student grant and is presently travelling around the world.  __S_igh.)  -children  DAYCARE SUBSIDIES REMOVED  Un March 27, the Department of Human  Resources removed subsidies from in-  home daycare services.  Formerly, parents of children in group group daycare  or in-home daycare were given subsidies  on a sliding scale.  The subsidies for children who are  cared for in a private home have been  removed, except for those of parents  who work shift work.  In view of the great shortage of group  daycare facilities, this is a severe  blow to many working women. We should  let the Minister of Human Resources,  Norm Levi, know how we feel about it.

After all,  we did get Benson and Hedges to withdraw an ad and the Human Rights  Commission did admit to us that sexist  ads, while not against the law, are  contrary to their principles!  In the meantime, perhaps a review of  some less obvious but equally damaging  sexist ads is in order. Advertising  is full of insidious double entendres,  meta-messages and "hidden persuaders"  when it comes to women. But even  .the most seasoned feminist will often  miss the less direct sexist ad while  noticing the one showing a lot of  flesh.  Because of possible libel, we can't  reprint the following ads in Kinesis  but we can allude to the more popular  ones which everyone, of us will recognize and the less well known ones  speak for themselves anyway. So here  goes!  There's one pantyhose ad that really  gets to me. "Gentlemen prefer..."  Nevermind what women prefer I The guy  is always with a lovely woman dressed  in pants and looking at the other  woman in the skirt. The old leg man!  No matter how liberated and lovely  you are, you will always lose out to  the more "feminine" woman. Dress for  the man, not yourself.  One of the saddest sexist ads I've  seen is the "does she or doesn't she"  hair colour piece. The women in them  are always wholesome looking young  mothers.  But get this.  "It was silly.  I'd had an easy time in the hospital.  But sometimes, for no reason, there'd  be tears in my eyes. No matter how  sweet Dick was, I felt my girlhood  was over. Then one day I had a  brainstorm. I decided to go blonde."  Translates: you have nothing to com-'  plain about dear or grin and bear it.  Brainstorm, really; even brunettes  are dumbI  There's an aspirin commercial that  says "simple pain can change the  way a woman looks." Half the picture  shows her composed and the other half  shows her in pain. You're supposed  to notice she has more crowsfeet with  the headache.  You're supposed to be  beautiful at all times, even when in  pain, how barbaric, even inhuman.  The ad should simply say aspirin  relieves pain.  An ad for baby powder says "innocence  is sexier than you think." This is  the old, men love us for our vulnerability trip, woman as child. When  do we get to grow up and still be  loveable and sexy?  No adman would show a woman stroking  a man's pants inviting her to feel  the fit. No ad would show secretaries  gawking at the boss' crotch with the  caption "the longer the better." No  ad would divide the male body below  the belt into chuck, rib, loin, rump  and round. No ad would show a man's  zipper half undone to catch the attention of female smokers. The censors  would never let them pass!  The list is neverending. Turn the  pieces around by placing a man in  the corresponding stereotyped male  role. It is always hilarious and  unreal. How come nobody is laughing  at the images of women in media?  Are they still taken seriously?  - Karen Richardson  Clip and Send.  COULD YOU  WEAR THIS  BADGE?

Vancouver Police Dept.  Public Relations Officer  312 Main Street  Vancouver, B. C.  Dear People:  The police commission's Task Force  on Women and Police recently recommended that greater effort be made  to encourage more women into police  work. In view of this recommendation,  we find it strange that the recent  ad "Could you wear this Badge?" sponsored by the Vancouver Police Dept.  seemed to emphasis police work as a  "man?s" job. More and more people  are questioning this "John Wayne"  image in law enforcement. I would  urge the VPD to reevaluate the kind  of image you are attempting to project in any future advertising campaign.  Sincerely,  Send copy to:  Task Force on Women and Police  #1550 - 409 Granville Street  Vancouver, B. C. i  human  rights hearing  On April 10, a five member board of  inquiry, appointed by the Minister of  Labour, heard the first case of alleged sex discrimination since the Human  Rights Code was enacted October 10,1974.  Noreen Ann Warren told the board that  she felt that she had been refused tenancy of a house owned by F.A. Cleland  and Son Realty because she is a female  single parent.  On October 9 she saw a FOR RENT sign  on a house at 2796 East 41st, and arranged by phone with F. Lindsay Cleland  to see the house. After viewing the  house on October 11, she was told by  Cleland that she was "at the top of  the list". However, on October 15 she  was informed that Cleland had discussed the situation with the co-owner Mr.  Fowler and they didn't want to rent to  a woman "on her own".  Ms. Warren told the board that she had  informed Mr. Cleland that her family  might seem unconventional to some (herself, a widowed mother aged 59, and  three children 16, jj| and 11^) but  it was a family.  She also said that  Mr. Cleland asked her if she could keep  up the double-sized corner lot and she  said she could. Ms. Warren said no  further investigation was made of her  ability or willingness to take care of  the grounds. When questioned hy the  board she reported that she had an  large assortment of garden tools (including two lawn mowers) and had been  praised by a former landlord in North  Vancouver for the way she had maintained a double lot there.  She said she  enjoyed gardening and that her children helped.  Ms. Warren felt she had been treated  unfairly' in being refused tenancy of  the house and she contacted the Van-  § icouver Status of Women who referred  her to the Human Rights Branch.  Human Rights Officer Hanne Jensen told  the board that during her investigation Cleland admitted that his sole  reason for rejecting Ms. Warren was  his fear that a single woman would not  be able to handle the property.  Ms. Jensen advised him that anyone who  refuses to rent accommodation on the  grounds of sex or marital status may  be guilty of a breach of the Human  Rights Code.  Both Mr. Cleland and his co-defendant  Mr. Fowler, stressed during the hearing that they had a policy of not renting that particular property to a single woman and that it was their right  as landlords and property owners to  protect their interests by choosing  who lived on their property. ,  Throughout the five hours of the hearing Mr. Cleland and Mr. Fowler proved  to be a treasury of sexist cliches.  Some of the gems they produced were:  "I have been brought up to believe  that a family is a husband and wife.  Mrs. Warren said there were four people  in her family. I took from that there  was a husband and wife and a couple  kids. Quite acceptable to me.  "The ideal*type of"tenant is the kind  we have now — a man of 48, his wife  and four children,14 to 21. Three  sons. They fully occupy the home, the ?  bedrooms. The kind of people we need.  "They'll tell us on the. phone "Sure  we're a family." We tell them we're  looking for a proper family combination."  "Single women can't handle it, so they  bring in friends. Like a commune."  Question: "You refused tenancy on the  property at 41st because she was a single parent?"  Answer" "Yes -- entirely unsuitable. A  single woman with a family is not suitable and she is one of that group."  Question: "Do you tell them why they  are not suitable?"  Answer: "No. It is usually very obvious why."  Question" "If Ms. Warren had a husband?"  Answer: "We would then have asked questions — to find out more."  Question: "Any person in a certain class  that isn't acceptable, then that person  is not acceptable?"  Answer: "Right."  Question: "One of those categories is a  a single woman with a family."  Answer: "Correct."  "When I asked her what her husband did  she now informed me that she didn't  have a husband. I decided to look at  other tenants. More or less made up  my mind."  "I think single women should be helped.  She is being ripped off—but.I am not  responsible for renting her a house."  "It bothered me that Mrs. Warreri was  working and had a couple little kids  —how could she keep it up?"  Asked if he would have considered a  single man with children —"A man because of his sex would be more capable  of taking care of the grounds."  "Families with husbands are more capable of looking after my property."  Question: "You claim you have the right  to refuse to rent on the basis of sex  and marital status in cases like this?"  Answer: "Right. It's my right as an  owner not to rent to people like this."  Although board member Marg Storm was  seated directly in front of them,both  Mr. Cleland and Mr. Fowler repeatedly  addressed themselves to "you gentlemen  on the board."  Ms. Warren, mother of three, trained  practical nurse, was referred to several times as a"girl."  After testimony and questioning, Gary  Carsen, Assistant Director of the Human Rights Branch, said the Branch contends that Mr. Cleland and Mr. Fowler  have violated the Human Rights Code,  Section 5 which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, marital status, religion, colour, ancestry,  or place of origin.  In agreeing with Carsen, Bill Black,  a member of of the Human Rights Commission which serves an educational  and liason function between the public  and the Branch, explained that the  rights of a person must be balanced,  against the rights of other people.  The Human Rights Code does not prevent  a landlord from deciding who occupies  his premises as'long as the person is  judged as an individual. "But rather  than judging Ms. Warren as an individual, Ms. Warren has been judged as  a member of a group — single parent  family. This is what discrimination  is based on — judging people as a  group rather than as individuals."  The board will deliver its verdict in  written form and is empowered to force  a person convicted under the Code to  make available any services denied  the complainant. It can also order  ,remuneration of any financial loss  suffered by the complainant and in  cases where there is proven damage  to self-respect the board can award  up to $5,000 damages.  - Jo Lazenby  FOCUS...  We interrupt the regular Focus  column to bring you a special  announcement.  Last October those of us who attended a so-called consultation on International Women's Year in Ottawa made  no bones about our first priority —  legislative change in line with the  recommendations made in the Royal  Commission Report on the Status of  Women in Canada. Various government  functionaries blithely assured us,  "Not to worry. The legislation you  want is coming." Of course, they didn't  tell us when, but the implication was  we could expect action soon.  We're now moving into the fifth month  of International Women's Year; seven  months have elapsed since last October's promises. We need that legislation now! "WHY NOT," Marc Lalonde,  Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women in Canada.  - Roberta Schlosberg  ...more  MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY  The B.C. Family and Children's Law  Commission's proposal for full and  immediate, community property was  tabled in the House,on Thursday,  April 10. This scheme provides for  equal sharing and management of the  financial resources of the couple  during the course of the marriage,  and equal division upon dissolution  of the marriage.  The present separate property scheme  does not take into account the equal  value of the contributions of the  home-maker and has clearly perpetrat-  , ed her highly vulnerable economic;  position.  We urge everyone to support full and  immediate community property by writing to Premier Barrett, Attorney-General Alex MacDonald and MLA's at the  Legislative.  (NOTE: The December 1974 Kinesis  carried a page long report from the  Working Group on Matrimonial Property  explaining the Community Property Proposal. Copies of this issue of Kinesis  are available from the VSW Office for  10c — to cover postage.) women in focus  1975 is International Women's Year  according to the United Nations,  which, in granting the title, has  guaranteed that women will be in the  news more than ever before.  This gives women an ideal opportunity  to be seen and heard but many feminists fear the publicity will give  only a token voice to women seriously  concerned with changing the status of  women, while perpetuating that barbie-  doll image current magazines and television seem to have of women.  Vancouver, however, has at least one  group of women who are taking the  publicity into their own hands.  They are doing it through a weekly  television series aptly titled "Women,  in Focus" which is aired at 9 p.m.  every Tuesday night on Cable 10,  Vancouver and which will run until  the end of May.  "Women in Focus" wants to profile  real women and their concerns so  topics include "Sexism in Schools"  (May 6),"Lesbian Women with Del Martin  & Phil Lyon" (May 13), "Women in the  3rd World" (May 20) and an interview  with Ms. Sylba Gelber, Director of  the Women's Bureau, Labour Canada,  Federal Government, scheduled to be  aired April 15.  "Women in Focus" is unique in that  the technical crew which has created,  directed and produced the series is  made up entirely of women.who have  been learning the techniques of television production through an audio/  visual workshop offered by the UBC  Women's Office.  After approaching and gaining the  support of Cable 10, Vancouver, two  members of the Women's Office, Marion  Barling and Jeanette Auger, took an  intensive training course at the  Cable 10 studios so that they could  direct the first 20 women who registered for the course.  Since last September, these" women have  learned to design and light sets, t<  handle the colour, black and white  and outdoor cameras, to monitor audio,  prepare graphics, switch and edit -  all skills generally performed by men.  For the programmes, special effects  have been used.  "Living Single" -  (June 3) has on-location film footage.  "The NDP Women's Caucus"v(April 29)  uses slides to illustrate the work  of the two women carpenters being  interviewed and a dramatic black and  white profile set gives a rape victim  anonymity, while keeping audience  interest during "Rape Relief"  (April 22).  Thanks to the donation of Cable 10  studio time and equipment and the  patience and time of Marion and Jeanette, The Women's Office has succeeded  in enlarging the scope and capabilities  of local women. For the course to be  fully productive though, they need  feed-back from the community, and you  can only give that by watching "Women  in Focus", 9 p.m. Tuesday's on Cable  10 T.V-  - Glynis Boulton  films  series  The Vancouver Film Society, in cooperation with the Feminist Nurses, will  present a series of eight films every  Tuesday night at 8 p.m. in the Christmas Seals Auditorium, 828 West 10th,  Vancouver.

BOOK     /  REVIEW  1  Conundrum by Jan Morris  Subtitled:  From James to Jan - an  extraordinary personal  narrative of transsexualism  A first glance at the sub-title of  this novel conjures up thoughts of  the News of the World, an English  Sunday newspaper specializing in the  sensational« "usually of a sexual  nature, with .an emphasis on unhappy  curates with a misplaced affection for  choir boys. A second look, however,  brings memories of James Morris, a  correspondent for The Manchester  Guardian whose articles were deservedly  read and enjoyed. This book is all  Manchester Guardian and no News of the  World, although the author would probably not appreciate that description  since of all his employers, he liked  the Guardian the least. He also  wrote for The Times of London and a  curious organisation called the Arab  News Agency.  The book tells of a journey from man  to woman, starting when James at age  five realised he had been born into  the wrong body, until the operation  in Algeria where the more obvious  traces of his masculinity were removed.  His childhood was generally happy, if  you accept and except the basic flaw -  (apart from that Mrs. Lincoln, how did  you enjoy the play?). A loner, but  not considered effeminate, he had  various homosexual encounters at  boarding school. This is not unusual  in such a setting for those who do not  play rugby and/or are addicted to cold  showers.  After school his life divided into  three parts.  First the man.  James  Morris, if not wholly part of the man's  world, was certainly of it, in the  Army, as a foreign correspondent,  climbing Mount Everest (not all the  way) with the Hunt expedition, and a  member of that most masculine of  institutions, the Gentleman's Club.  Eventually marriage and the father of  four children.  Then the limbo years, literally a  no-mansland, during which time,  swallowing thousands of pills, he  became ambivalent, a comparatively  easy thing in this uni-sex world.  I  say "comparatively" glossing over  years of torment and misery for himself and surely his family as well.  To the final and irreversible step,  surgery in Algeria, told with a wry  humour that almost obliterates the  horror of that bizarre and frightening  experience. Two further operations  in England for the operation by the  doctor in Algeria was "functionally  incomplete" - two chilly words. And  then most difficult perhaps of all,  the adjustment of her family and  friends to Jan from James, and her  actions and reactions on being a woman.  Of especial interest to all feminists  is the change of attitude and treatment by men to Jan who is essentially  the same person as James. That since  her body was now as female as possible,  her brain and her ability to cope had  obviously diminished accordingly -  an opinion that is to some extent  shared by Jan herself,  A fascinating, courageous and very  readable book.  Available in hardcover at $ 7.60.  Of the five Duthie book stores I  checked, only one had a copy. However Seymour Books on Lonsdale Avenue,  North Vancouver have several copies,  so if you want to buy the book a  local store would probably be the  best bet.  I was also told the book  would be available in paperback  "sometime".  - Margaret Nicholls  Poem  Little frail child  standing on a  darkened corner;  waiting for the  butcher man;  to rid you  of yourself;  faintly hoping  he won't show;  and knowing that  he will;  MONEY DOES WONDERS  til]  you're scared;  and very much alone; >;^^^  mother doesn't know;  AND DOESN'T CARE  finally he shows;  the ride is short;  you enter the  vacant garage;  a single bulb  shows you the  wet blood stained  matress on the  grimy floor;  the lady who'll  do the job  smiles land tells 1  you to lie down;  your clothes are off  and you're on  your back;  you see the darning needle in  her hand;  you close your eyes;  and wonder if he r&ally  loved you;  HE DIDN'T  he tells you  not to worry;  it won'x hurt;  but that's a lie;  and she gags .you  when, you start  to scream;  SCREAMING IS WRONG  WHEN A FAVOR IS BEING DONE j  FOR YOU'  water and blood  ooze from within  and mixes with the  filth you  rest  upon;    |||tlp|  she smiles at you  tells you it's done;  "just lie there for  another half-hour then you  can catch a cab at the  corner ..be seeing you"  she and the man leave;  and the mattress  continues to soak up  the blood that's  gushing from your womb;  ^you try to get up;  but you can't;  the blood doesn't step;  and you know  what that means?  tears stream down  your whitened face;  you want your mother;  and your boy-friend  you even ask God.to  save you;  you promise that  you'll be a good girl  but no one comes  to help you;  then your sobbing  stops; you've fainted;  finally your breathing stops;  and the both of one;  the baby and you;  are dead;  Across the city  miles away;  a girl stands  on a darkened corner;  waiting for the butcher man  to  come.

Ml  D  Rosemary Brown was born in Jamaica  in 1930, and came to Canada as a student in 1949.  She received a BA from  McGill University in 1955 and a Masters  of Social Work from UBC  She worked  as a Social Worker with the Children's  Aid Society of B.C., the Montreal  Children's Hospital, and the Vancouver  Neurological Society. She also served as the first Vancouver Status of  Women Ombudswoman (1970-72) and as  a Counsellor at SFU.  Rosemary Brown has had a long involve  ment with women in Canada. She was  a member of the Voice of Women Movement that tried to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increase of nuclear testing. She remembers, "We joined forces, wrote  letters, signed petitions, presented  briefs, collected your babies' teeth  and marched — we marched for peace,  for the end of nuclear testing, for  the safe clean world in which we,as  well as our children,could live."  Throughout the years she continued  her support of the CCF Party in which  the present New Democratic Party is  rooted, and after becoming a Canadian  citizen she joined the NDP.  In 1972  she was elected as MLA for Vancouver-  Burrard, the position she presently  holds in the BoC. Legislature. Her  legislative responsibilities include:  Chairperson Select Standing Committee  on Health, Education and Human Resources  Member of Select Standing Committee  on Municipal Affairs  Member of Select Standing Committee  on Labour and Justice  Member of Special Committee on Assessment and Property Taxation  UM  "It is my intention to run a strong  campaign based on a committment to  socialism, feminism, the preservation of our natural resources, the  protection of our environment and for  the rights of workers and all people."  With these words, Rosemary Brown  launched her campaign to become national leader of the New Democratic  Party.  It creates an exhausting schedule  As an MLA she spends Monday through  Friday in the Victoria legislature.  Ci=  From an article for the Montreal Star  (March 21, 1975).  "An open and blatant committment to  the special constituency of workers,  women and the disadvantaged must remain firm, and the party must accept  the challenge to lead the fight against sexism and racism in society, recognizing that like socialism, and in  socialism, they call for a new human  community, based on the creative and  co-operative use of power to create  new economic, social and political  forms — that ensure tender regard  and respect for the life of the plan- -.  et on which we live and the liberation  of all humankind to fulfill our potential as intelligent human beings."  "Poverty exists and thrives on an  economic system, whose survival is  dependent on an unorganized and exploited work force, consisting largely of older people, immigrants, women  and unskilled males. Handouts do not  constitute a solution the system  must change."  From her campaign platform:  "Feminism, like socialism, calls for  a new human community based on the  creative and co-operative use of power to create new economic, social and  political forms."  "The one million women living below  the poverty line and the working poo*  do not need to be told that the wealth  of Canada is not being equitably distributed ."  At a Women and Politics Workshop at  Capilano College, Nov. 23, 1974, Rosemary Brown responded to the question  of why women should involve themselves  in politics and what contributions  they would bring to the political  structure by quoting several pther  sources to re-inforce her own statements .  "I believe that if we are committed  to ending our oppression and achieving true equality then we are going  to have to do the job ourselves —  that we can no longer sit back and  hope that nice, kindly, concerned  gentlemen are going to do the job  for us."  The Lou Harris poll of 1973 showed,  "women are voting differently from  men, they are more inclined now to  vote and to become active, not only  in their self interest, but for the  interest of society, the world, and  most of all out of compassion for  humanity."  Shirley Chisholm ~ "Politics is the [  only route to power and even in the  most democratic society, power is the  name of the game. Power makes, interprets and reinforces the laws.  It decides what interests will flourish and which shall perish. It determines who will be educated and how  much, who may work at what kinds of  jobs, where they may live and what  they may do and with whom..."  "I believe that it is crucial that  women bring an added1dimension to  politics, that we be more than just  carbon copies of male politicians."  "I believe women bring to the political field the same skills and abilities as anyone else."  Kirsten Amundsen — "It is through  politics,after all, that one gets the  rules and regulations, the important  legislation that determines wages and  working conditions that guarantees  access and opportunity and that provides for the necessary services enabling women as well as men to fully  develop and utilize their talents and  skills.  It is also, ultimately, politics that will change institutions  and the social conditioning structuring both the male and female personality in this society. And it is mainly through politics that one can hope  to rebuild values and to change the  blatantly counterfeit stereotypes of  women that now get in the way of understanding and appreciating their  true situation and genuine needs..."  "The shortage of women in the political arena serves as a real handicap  to those women who are there. So  often, political decisions are decided by votes — in caucus or in the  house and even in those instances ,  where there is a solidarity on the  part of the women politicans, their  numbers are so few that they exist  as symbols rather than as real forces  for change. I quote from Evelyn  Sullerot,"The problem of female representation has a double aspect: on  the one hand every woman elected is  one who in political terms has educated herself, who has learnt that 'politics is the art of the possible' and  that all major decisions are ultimately due to it. On the other hand she  must educate female voters in her turn  and by her very existence. This process can only be called successful if  there is an increase, however slight,  in the percentage of women elected.  It is only then that ... the political  education of women voters, members  of voluntary associations and local  representatives will improve."  "For more than half a century we have  enjoyed formal political rights on  an equal basis with men — full membership in the political class, has  been of little or no use to us in  terms of gaining equal rights and  opportunities —.we have not used  these rights effectively — if we  take a realistic look at the political *power base possessed by women  in this country. We find that women's  share of positions in legislatures,  on top administrative levels, in city  halls, on boards of supervisors and  boards of education — in any and all  of the institutions where membership  persumably opens the way for equal  and/or effective representation are  limited."  Royal Commission on the Status of  Women in Canada — "Ho  country can  make the claim to having equal status  for its women, so long as its government lies entirely in the hands of  men. The obstacles to genuine participation, when they lie in prejudice,  in unequal family responsibility, or  in financing a campaign, must be approached with a genuine determination  to change the present imbalance...."  "I believe that it is no longer necessary for us to explore why we should  be involved but believe that rather  our energies should be directed to the  more crucial question of how we become  elected." <svt&&s|>  "I see it as one of my clear respon-  iblities to encourage and support  more women in their efforts to enter  the political arena. I see myself,  as doing little more than keeping  my finger in the dyke until my sister  politicans arrive. There are clear  limitations on what four or even five  women in a legislature can do — so  this is one obstacle that we must  struggle to remove and remove quickly."  "We have the opportunity and responsibility to (1) achieve equality (2)  to improve the calibre and level of  politics and (3) to improve the quality and reality of life for all people  through our efforts and involvements."  "We have always been assured that we  did not need political clout to achieve our goals, because of the special and unique relationship which we  share with our oppressors — who oppress us only to protect us. We were  taught that politics was an ugly and  unpleasant forum and no place for  delicate creatures like us. And that  in any event, our oppressors were  better informed as to what was best  for us and could be depended upon at  all times, to act and make decisions  on our behalf and in our best interests. Well, 2000 years later, as we  view our plight, we recognize the  fallacy of that myth • The protection of our oppressors has served to  deny us of our rights, deprive us of  our responsibilities, as well as our  Weekday evenings she visits the federal ridings, now in the process of  ^ selecting delegates for the convention July 3 - 6 in Winnipeg. Weekends  she travels to other parts of the  country attempting to build national  supporto  Ms. Brown's political commitment is  to establish the NDP as a "clear socialist alternative." In her words,  that "calls for designing a new system  ... a new human community based on  the creative and co-operative use of  power to create new economic, social  and political forms." .  If you support the platform and the  candidate what can you do?  "First get elected as a delegate,"  says Robin Gearey, a Brown campaign  organizer, "or elect a delegate to  :the convention." One-third of the  delegates will be trade union affiliates, and the remainder represent  constituentso Each federal riding  with a party membership of up to 200  is entitled to send one delegate and  one additional delegate for every 100  jmembers over that number.  "Contact your local or provincial NDP  association to find whether delegate  selection has taken place already in  your riding, Ms. Gearey advises.  "If  not, you are entitled to stand for  nomination.  If you aren't a part^r  member, join and vote for a  delegate who will support Rosemary."  "If the delegates for the riding have  been selected," Robin continues, "we  still have to translate publicity into constituency support and delegate  votes."  "Let your MLA and MP know that you  support Rosemary Brown. Write to  your local and party newspapers, the  provincial and federal NDP councils,  your local labour council/federation.  Contact your friends in other ridings  and ask them to vote for delegates  who support her," notes Robin. Like  lobbying on any issue, it's a matter  of educating, persuading and building  more and more support.  Last, but never least, campaign workers state that a donation of $10 or  whatever you can afford will help cover expenses.  "Women must try to support female  candidates financially," says Robin.  "It's something we haven't done before  often because we had so little money  of our own. If we can't help financially, we must do whatever we can."  "It's important that women participate at every level of our government,"  she says. "In this case, a woman is  seeking the highest office in a federal party."  4Ms.Gearey points out that there has  been a shift in attitude since the  campaign began.  "At the beginning,  for example, the media seemed to say,  'How dare she step into a man's domain? ' Since then, the press coverage has increased and become serious."  Why? "Because Rosemary t:lks about  real issues, is well-prepared for  meetings, gives thought-provoking  and well-researched speeches," explains Robin,, "She has shown that  she is a serious politican."  Some 1500 delegates are expected to  stand on that convention floor in  Winnipeg this July and decide whether Rosemary Brown will be the next  NDP leader. She needs 751 votes to  make it. The actions of women across  Canada in the next few months may  well decide who gets those votes and  whether the convention marks a turning point in the history of Canadian  politics."  _ Marilyn Moreton, WCWN  privileges, and to leave us economically vunerable. We have been denied  even of the freedom to make decisions  affecting either our bodies or our  minds, and we are tied up in legislative tangles, which depict ua as incompetents, penalize us for living  too long (insurance and pension plans)  and debate whether our life is worth  the expenditure of sums of money on  early breast cancer detection, etc."  "One of the arguments used by voters  at the constituent level, not to support the nomination of a woman, is that  voters don't vote for women — this  myth has been challenged and punctured many times. The reluctance of  voters to support women candidates is  passing. It is being eroded also by  the increasing evidence that women  now have a constituency — that increasingly large number of women now  recognize the importance of more feminists — women committed to women,  participating at the decision making  levels in government. And the continued and rapid erosion of that early  myth must continue and we must do everything that we can to destroy it  every opportunity that we get."  "Our goal must be to ensure that because there is a politically significant relationship between the proportion of representative positions  a group can claim for itself and the  degree to which the needs and interests of that group are .articulated  and acted upon in political institutions — representation in all levels  of government must more accurately  reflect our numbers in society."  In a televised debate "Resolved that  politics is a man's game," moderated  by Pierre Berton, and broadcast by  Global T.V. on March 9,1975, Dalton  Camp stated " Politics is about property, finance, commerce... all the  things to which men have a committment.  There are no female 'captains of industry' " and until there are, he  suggested, politics would continue  to be a man's game.  Rosemary Brown responded that women  do all the sweaty behind the scenes  jobs in politics and only appear to  be unittvolved because they shun the  spotlight.  "We must take back the  power base we have given the men; we  must stop bolstering their egos and  nurturing their idosyncrasies. It  is time we became part of the decision-making process, because the wrong  decisions have been made for 150  .years in this country. Male politicans have allowed our resources to  be ravaged; and our environment to be  polluted. Politics is not a game,  its survival. Women must use their  power and talent to introduce more  compassion and more concern for people  into the Canadian political scene." ywca  Women's Camp Weekend— a relaxing  weekend on Saltspring Island —  Victoria Day Weekend.

B.C.F.W.  weekends  WHAT'S NOT GOING ON  The B.C. Federation of Women has been  forced to postpone the Victoria Action  Weekend which had been schedulded for  April 18-20. The main reason for the  postponement is the strike and lockout  situation in Victoria and surrounding  municipalities. The Esquimalt Recreation Centre, where the forum was  to have been held, has been locked out,  along with most other public buildings,  for two months already and the strike  is expected to continue until mid summer. Every effort was made to locate  alternative premises in Victoria and  Vancouver that would include daycare  and forum facilities for the large  number of women expected, but to no  avail.  Registration money is being returned  (but there's always the postal strikes  to contend with!)  Further plans will be relayed.  WHAT'S  GOING  ON?  SFU  BC. WOMEN'S STUDIES ASSOCIATION  The B.C. Women's Studies Association  has decided to establish a Women's  Research Center, and has obtained some  initial funding for it from the Dept.  of Economic Planning. The Center will  gather information about research that  is relevent to Women's Studies in any  area, and will act as a link among  people who are working on Women's  issues in B.C. and the Yukon. They are  interested not just in formal academic  research, but also in community action  projects, briefs, autobiographical  materials, and anything like this.

WORTH IT! who's  in charge   around   here?  "Organizations which are making policy which affects the majority of  people in the country -should perhaps  be composed with proportional female  representation."  This comment is contained in a draft  paper completed in January 1975 for  the federal Advisory Council on the  Status of Women. It shows that "proportional female representation," is  far from a reality in federal policymaking.  In this preliminary survey, forced to  use sources that are "neither clear  nor consistent in their presentation  of the data," researcher Marcia Rioux  attempted'to determine how many women  sit on approximately 150 boards of  directors of Crown Corporations, Boards  Commissions, Advisory Councils and  Committees of the federal government.  The findings are not encouraging. A  Amongst full-time appointees, 247  are male and only 16 female. In part  time positions, there are 832 males  and 119 females.  As Rioux points out,"since such organizations are recommending and enforcing government policy on a wide  variety of issues which affect Canadians in almost all areas of life, j  women should be equally represented  in appointments being made." Yet, of  1214 appointees, a mere 11 per cent  women.  The study reveals that the female  representation is somewhat lop-sided.  "Women are equally or over-represented in only three" of the organizations  studied, which "mi^ht be interpreted  as indicative of female interests in  Canadian society."  These "female" interests are: women  > (24 of 26 members on the Advisory  Council on the Status of Women), welfare (9 of 20 on the National Council  of Welfare), and consumerism (14 of  30 on Consumer Advisory Council).  Even in these areas, the study notes  that there are other welfare/health  and consumerism organizations which  have no or insignificant female representation.  The report concludes: "Organizations  ... designed to represent the composition of Canadian society should  take sex, as well as age, occupation,  education, etc. into account to ensure  that they truly represent the views  of all citizens."  For a copy of the study write: Advisory Council on the Status of Women,  P.O. Box 1451, Station B, Ottawa, Ont.  -prepared by Marilyn Moreton  WCWN  advisory   council  Members of the Advisory Council on  the Status of Women (ACSW) called  for Dr. Henry Morgentaler's immediate release from prison on the  grounds that no jury convicted him.  At the close of their three day me  meeting at the Conference Centre  in Ottawa, April 9, 1975, ACSW members urged the Governor General in  Council to exercise the Royal prerogative of mercy to commute Morgen-  '■'taler's 18-month sentence, release  him immediately and pardon him.  The ACSW expressed alarm at the recent  decision by the Supreme Court of  Canada, upholding the Quebec Court  of Appeals' judgement which reversed  the acquittal of Dr. Morgentaler by  a jury.  A motion stated,"The reversal of a  jury's verdict by an Appeals Court  without ordering a new trial is contrary to long-established judicial  precedent and effectively destroys  the right of the accused to be tried  by a jury of peers."  The ACSW will urge Government to present to Parliament amendments to the  Criminal Code to ensure that appellate tribunals' powers are limited,  in the case of jury acquittals, to  the ordering of new trials.  Further indication of concern in the  same area was expressed in the demand that Parliament conduct its long  promised free debate on the subject  of abortion.  The ACSW also expressed grave concern over the lack of action on  Human Rights Legislation.  "Future funding of women's groups was  . discussed and it was recommended to  the Government that the funding of  women's groups should become a permanent program and be augmented to $1  million annually.  Norah Frood, Chairperson of the Banking Sub-committee announced a joint  study on women in banking to be carried out with the Canadian Banker's  Association — the first successful  co-operative development with a group  in the private sector.  Interim steps were taken in several  areas —family planning, matrimonial  property, and rape, as members work  towards final recommendations.  Pressure will be brought to bear on  the Government to pass the Citizenship Bill which will give Canadian  mothers the right to confer citizenship" on their children. This Bill  C-20 was given first reading in the  House of Commons in October.  The ACSW called on Canadian National  to make public its study of women  employed by that federal crown corporation.  Dr. Katie Cooke said," You must  speak loudly and clearlji if your  affairs matter to you, and let the  decision makers know that it will  not be politically helathy for them  to ignore your needs any longer.

The B.C.T.F. brief, which will be presented at the C.R.T.C. hearing April  22, expressed several reasons for their  i position:  1. There is too much commercial television now in the Lower Mainland.  2. Most of the programs and advertis- .  ing that we see are degrading to  humanity.  3. There is a need for a public broadcasting channel which would allow noncommercial use by all kinds of groups  in society — minorities, environmental, ethnic, social, cultural, educational, women's, religious, labour,  The majority of the representatives  at the meeting, including the Media  Action Group from VSW, endorsed the  B.C.T.F. brief and signed a petition  urging the C.R.T.C. to turn down all  the commercial applications for Channel  10.  - Nadine Allen  avid ant icier  Your Avid Articler has turned up the  following for your reading pleasure,  and/or article file...

We know that you are probably saying  "What! Another letter about breast  cancer screening, another letter about  the Omnibus Bill?", but unfortunately  they are still necessary. The public  response to these issues has not yet  been strong enough to elicit action  (Although we could probably sit all  afternoon and debate just how loud  we have to be before they "hear" us!)  We must use the techniques used so  ably by the anti-abortion groups,  constant fervent letters and public  comment on the issues that are important to us.  In a recent communication with Letter  Lobby Co-ordinator Dorothy Holme,  Dr. Katie Cooke, Chairperson of the  Federal Advisory Council on the Status  of Women commented "What can women  do?...women in general must start  assuming their social responsibilities  of pressuring for change. Your letter  lobbying is superb - keep it up!  It  is only when pressure is put on govern  ment that it acts and thus far the  pressure has not been "hot" enough to  even get the non-controversial Omnibus  Bill to second reading".  So, here's your spring clean-up list.  1. READ the Katie Cooke article on  page 3 of the APRIL KINESIS to  understand what Bills C-16, C-20  and C-52 will do for you and contact your own federal M.P, about  your concern over their delayed  progress.  (The Letter Lobby  Committee will be sending a mailing  to all M.P.'s on behalf of VSW in  early May to back-you up).     fjfe  2. Mention in your letter the incredible need for federal human  rights legislation to be enacted  NOW. We have been waiting since  December of 1973 for definite word  on a federal human rights act.  Robert Kaplan, M.P. for York Centre  in Ontario spoke to several VSW  staff members a few weeks ago and  commented that he had heard human  rights legislation was coming  "soon" that's the same line we  have been hearing for over a year.  (See Focus, page 3, April Kinesis)  ,3..

SOME GOOD NEWS NOW - we have heard  that due to pressure from women across  the country, the federal government  is going to be correcting the "$1,000  tax-free interest" clause (outlined  in last month's Letter Lobby) for  next year. We have also heard that  the pressure exerted by all of us on  the Ministry of Transport is making  them re-word some of their original  amendments re the pregnant-stewardess  conflict. Let's hope their re-wording  is satisfactory! We will give you  more details on these two points as  we receive them.  responses  y  This letter from Dr. Scott Dunbar,  Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee  on Breast Cancer was written in  response to our request for complete  updating on the plans of the Ad Hoc  Committee. We reprint it in full  for your information. Please follow  through with the suggestions in the  final paragraph.  The Breast Cancer Screening Programme  which we have recommended to the  Minister of Health is intended to do  two things. The first is to offer  breast cancer screening to the women  of British Columbia* in stages. The  first stage would be in Vancouver,  and would last about a year. The  second stage would be in middle sized  communities in the province, and would  also be of about a year's duration.  The third stage, with the help of  vans, like those used until recently  for the detection of chest tuberculosis, would carry the detection  programme into the small and remote  communities in the province, so that  after approximately three years, the  programme would be province-jwide.  It is also intended as a research  project in the sense that the breast  screening would be offered to half  the women in the communities involved  as the programme progressed from one  stage to the next. This is because  it is not yet known with certainty  whether breast cancer screening  really reduces the mortality from the  disease, though the evidence for this  is encouraging. As soon as information became available, from our own  programme or from elsewhere,  confirming or refuting the value of  early detection of breast cancer by  mass screening, we would extend it  to all the women in the appropriate  age group, or cancel it entirely, as  appropriate.  The risks from radiation in such a  programme are now very small indeed,  and to the very best of our knowledge  are negligible in comparison with the  anticipated benefits.  We estimate that province-wide  screening, when fully established in  the third stage as above, would cost  about a million dollars per year.  There are now approximately twenty-  five breast cancer screening centres  in operation in the United States,  under the auspices of the U.S. National  Cancer Institute, and made possible  by Federal funding. One of them is  in Seattle; it has been in operation  for over two years, is very busy and  very successful, and members of our  Committee have more than once visited  Seattle to examine at first hand the  operation of the screening clinic.  It is important to realize, however,  that in none of the U.S. cancer  screening clinics is there a "Control  Study" as we are proposing for the  British Columbia project. It has  seemed to us from the beginning that  it is essential to have such a "Control  Study" as an integral part of the  project, since we do not feel that  the evidence is as yet conclusive,  though it is very promising indeed,  that breast- cancer screening truly  reduces the'mortality from the disease.  Our Committee includes surgeons,  therapeutic radiologists, diagnostic  radiologists, pathologists, and epidemiologists. In addition, we have  sought advice and consultation from  authorities on the subject outside  our committee, and continue to do so.  It is also important to realize that  the breast cancer screening programme  we are recommending does not mean  just x-ray examination of the breast  (Mammography). It would include  clinical examination of the breast by  a surgeon or a suitably trained nurse,  x-ray examination, instruction in  self-examination, and likely Thermography of the breast.  It has seemed to us that a thorough  project to encompass screening programmes throughout the country would  be difficult to organize and unlikely  to succeed. British Columbia, on the  other hand, is a geographically well  - defined entity, a wealthy province,  the vital statistics in the province  are excellent, and the present government of the province is keenly interested in preventative as well as  curative health measures. In addition, we have the benefit of the  cervical cancer screening programme  already in successful operation in  the province, and some of the persons  responsible for that magnificent programme are on our committee. We thus  feel that breast cancer screening  should be instituted in British  Columbia, and that it should include  a control study.  We are most pleased with the interest  and support of the Vancouver Status  of Women. Since the government of  the province has not yet made a final  decision about our proposal, we would  suggest that any of your members  interested in the problem, and our  proposed approach to it, should make  their interest known to Health Minister Cocke, and to us. I should add  that we are not only soliciting support for the project, because we  welcome criticism as well as support.  I would hope that the Press would  continue to take an interest in this  important matter, and letters to  editors as well as to members of the  government are a legitimate and  effective way of public information  and debate.  Yours truly,  J.Scott Dunbar, M.D.  Chairman, Ad Hoc Committee When Susan Sanderson was in Grade 10,  she was called a "suffragette".  In  1966, in Camplhell River, this was not  neant as a compliment.  It was a comment on her unwillingness to fall in  with the acceptable social patterns  — the male-female games, the "right  way of doing things."  In 1970 Susan was working as a receptionist at a printing company in Vancouver and happened to read The Feminine Mystique by Betty Freidan.  It  made,, sense — she realized she was not  "just a lone weirdo!" There were other  women who felt and thought the way  she did.  Gradually over the next couple of  years Susan became more and more  aware of activities going on in the  women's movement and of the new ideas  and attitudes that the movement was  trying to introduce into society.  One summer she worked on an OFY project called Earth Shine, teaching  elementary school age children arts  and crafts.. She was impressed by the  way a fellow worker, a woman from  Berkley, California, interacted with  the children in a non-sexist way —  not expecting anything different or  enforcing roles on either the boys  or girlsv  Soon after this Susan attended a conference that featured Shelagh Day  speaking on the Affirmative Action  Bill that Rosemary Brown was introducing. This led her to attend a  General Meeting of Vancouver Status  of Women.  Susan's initial reaction  to a VSW General Meeting was not a  particularly favourable one.  It appeared to be very 'cliquish' — the  only people who really knew what was  going on or who talked to each other  were a small 'in-group'. Everyone  else felt bewildered and left-out and  self-conscious.  (This is not the only  time this sentiment about the General  Meetings has been expressed and it is  something that we should take definite steps to rectify. This sort of  'in-group elitism' is against all our  feminist principles!)  It is only because by this time Susan  had sufficent self-motivation (as she  says "When your committment becomes  such that you want to do something ,  you look for ways") that she persisted in attending General Meetings.  Eventually,last summer, she decided  to try an Orientation Meeting. Here  she found the reception warm and informal and when she learned of the  various activities at VSW, she joined  SPOTLIGHT  on a member  the Media Action Group that was monitoring the image of the image of women  presented in advertising, radio and  T.V.  This particular activity touched a  responsive chord in Susan because by  this time she had completed a two  year course at Langara College in advertising, interior design and window  display and had achieved a longtime  goal of becoming a window trimmer at  a major department store. And she  found herself in a philosophical bind  — she enjoys the work which allows  her expression of her artistic sense  and ingenuity but she feels she is  contributing to the old'commercial  rip-off of women. The better she  is at her job in promoting fashion,  the more she is involved in exploiting women's insecurities, in convincing women that they really need'X'  to be better, to be 'in fashion', to  be more glamourous, to be more of a  woman.  And although her work is respected  and is judged on its own merits apart  from the fact that she is a woman,  Susan finds that all the social and  interpersonal contact at the store  is definitely part of the 'male-female  game'. Again she is caught in the  bind — whether to take the easy route  and just go along and thereby not  make waves with the people she works  with, or to comment on and take a  firm and unpopular stand on certain  attitudes and behaviours and thereby  fight everyday the 'what do you women  libbers want anyway' fight.  She finds  other women,as well as men, at the  store cannot understand why she insists on being called a "woman" Instead  of a "girl", why she does not find the  sexual bantering particularly amusing,  why she termed certain comments in the  fashion shows demeaning to women.  And when she was successful in convincing a divison manager that sets  of drinking glasses depicting nude  women were in poor taste and should  be removed from sale, they were offered to the staff at a reduced price  and were snapped up by both male and  female employees.  Constantly having to stand up for  your value system and insisting on  a certain type of treatment can be  exhausting. And although Susan en-'  joys her work she finds the struggle  is diminishing the sense of accom;-  plishment the work provides.  She  wants to become more involved in working towards social change, but she  hates to give up the part of her work  that she enjoys and which she has  worked towards for so long.  In the hopes of sorting out some of  her conflicting feelings, Susan joined a VSW Communications Workshop that  she saw mentioned in Kinesis.  She  was looking for some kind of support  in dealing with people at work and  in her personal life.  She felt she  needed another perspective of herself  other than the one she got from men.  (And in bur society, hasn't our perspective of ourself been mainly derived from the way we relate to the men  around us?)  In the early stages of  the workshop, Susan found that she  was actually viewed as "hostile" and  "anti-group" and that it wasn't her  ideas or values that were unacceptable  but her means of communication did  not always relay what she wanted to  others.  She came to know and ultimately accept her own ideas and idiosyncrasies and is now working on  "mellowing-out my approach."  And with this acceptance of herself  comes a deeper committment to the  values she holds in the women's movement and its ability to change the  things she feels are damaging in the  way people in our society interact  with one another. And she knows that  as she becomes more involved in this  committment she will have to. make  certain major decisions about her work.  - Jo Lazenby  NEWS  A man and woman in Victoria are petitioning the provincial government to  correct what they term "a serious and  unfortunate situation that has arisen  with the revision (1974) of the Landlord and Tenant Act."  They are referring to the practice,  allowed under the Act, of landlords  being allowed to evict tenant in order  to occupy rental accomodations themselves. In many cases this practice  has become a means by which a landlord  can force a rent increase or punish a  tenant who insists on his rights.  The petition states "the entire reforming force of the Act has been rendered  ineffective, in that any tenant seeking  its protec .ion can be evicted because  his landlord "requires" his suite. In  the same way, any tenant refusing to  agree to an illegal rent increase can  be forced out of his home and the rent  increased afterwards."  The petition urges the government to  consider amendments in the Landlord  and Tenant Act to deal with this situation.  For details of the petition contact:  Paul & Barbara Hutcheson  3529 Salsbury Way, Victoria  Phone: 382-7672 A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE  Some travesties of justice so appall  the legal mind as almost to defy  description.  For this legal mind,  Section 251 of the Criminal Code of  Canada is just such an instance.  I wrote those words a year ago, and  most readers will be aware that Section  21 of the Criminal Code is the law on  abortion. As most readers may also  guess, the recent decision of the  Supreme Court of Canada in The Queen  v. Morgenthaler has done nothing to  persuade this writer that we as  Canadians can rely upon our judiciary  to protect the citizen against arbitrary  and unjust laws.  The import of the Morgenthaler decision  was made abundantly clear to me by the  circumstances in which I learned of  the decision. Those of us at Seder  (the Jewish feast of the Passover) had  heard and spoken of the Warsaw ghetto,  the gas chambers, the flight from  Egypt, the pogroms, all of those things  which those of us in the Christian  tradition would refer to as the 2000  year persecution of the Jewish people.  We had joined in an expression of  commitment to the causes of oppressed  people everywhere, expressed commitment  to the demands of women for equality  and justice, and finally, we were asked  to raise our glasses and drink to Dr.  Henry Morgenthaler, back in jail as  a result of the recent Supreme Court  decision.  I wasn't at the first Seder, that of  the Wednesday on which Dr. Morgenthaler  was actually returned to jail.  I was  at the third Seder, that of the Friday  of March 28.  The irony of taking Seder  on Good Friday had not escaped me, but  when I learned there that the Court  had chosen to return Dr. Morgenthaler  to jail on the eve of Passover, interesting things began to happen to me.  I thought about the man who refused to  abide by laws which forbid one human  being to reach out to another human  being in pain, and relieve that suffering.  I wondered how that human  being came to believe so firmly that  the citizen is never bound to abide  by unjust laws, laws which oppress  other human beings, and I wondered  whether Dr. Morgenthaler went to jail  feeling as much peace and strength as  I saw in him here in Vancouver last  autumn. I wondered how many other  people caught the irony of his return  to prison on the eve of Passover, and  I wondered who in the Supreme Court  had said'to himself, "O.K., guys.  So we'll crucify this guy if that's  what the people want, and Parliament  says we have to do.  But let's call  a spade a spade, and not pretend it  doesn't matter. A crucifixion is an  important event, and we'd better do  it on the eve of Passover, because  that's when crucifixions take place."  I wondered how many other gentiles  took Seder with their Jewish friends,  and cried at the lack of change in  2000 years.  Cried because man's inhumanity to man seems so boundless >  and infinite.  I wondered how many  women across Canada were tempted to  adopt man's way, and use violence to  convince "our" government that the  limit of our tolerance has been  reached.  Prejudice is an insidious and frightening force.  It has driven men to  destroy, defile, and kill, all in.the  name of love.  It has helped the rich  of one generation become the paupers  of the next generation, and helped  the paupers of every generation hunger  and die.  In Canada, it has led to  the annihilation of the Indian way  of life, the derision by English  Canadians of their French Canadian  neighbours, and the passage of immigration laws totally devoid of godly  principles. And on March 26, 1975,  prejudice led Canada to abandon that  most sacred institution in our judicial system,, the verdict by a jury  of our peers.  Abandoned because one word in the  Criminal Code was "should" and the  Court in its wisdom felt that "would"  was the. word Parliament would (should?)  have chosen had they wanted to preserve  the right of the individual to be  tried by a jury.  Abandoned because a decision of the  English courts is of only historical  interest now in Canada....of historical interest only, despite the fact  that the Minister of Justice assured  the Canadian Parliament during debate  on the present abortion law that  Canadian courts would read that  decision into our law.  Abandoned when English Canadians  fear that French Canadians totally  oppose abortion law reform, but an  all-French jury acquitted Dr. Morgenthaler.  Abandoned when a jury could at last  be assured that the doctor who aborted  a woman was not a quack, but a highly-  skilled member of the medical profession applying highly-respected techniques and judgment to a medical  problem.  Abandoned when the Court was faced  with a man who spent his early years  in Auschwitz and Dachau, those ultimate products of arbitrary laws and  uncontrolled power.  Abandoned when faced with a man who  well knew that "the limits of tyrants  are prescribed by the endurance of  those whom they oppress."  Abandoned when the Court itself  should have been responsible for  reconstructing the ideals rather than  destroying the system.  The Court did not choose to reconstruct the ideals, for the Court had  met its own prejudices. As has been  pointed out so often, feelings connected with the subjection of women  tend to be the most intense and most  deeply-rooted of all those which  gather round and protect old institutions and customs, and the choice  made was to abandon the jury in favour  of the continued subjection of women.  Why? John Stuary Mill would have  explained it thus:  So long as an opinion is  strongly rooted in the feelings,  it gains rather than loses in  stability by having a preponderating weight of argument  against it. For if it were  accepted as a result of argument,  the refutation of the argument  might shake the solidity of the  conviction; but when it rests  solely on feeling, the worse it  fares in argumentative contest,  the more persuaded its adherents  are that their feeling must have  some deeper ground, which the  arguments do not reach; and while  the feeling remains, it is always,  throwing up fresh intrenchments  of argument to repair any breach  made in the old.  And Mill would have been right.  The  Supreme Court of Canada is made up of  experts in the art of finding arguments  which prove to a Court that the particular concept which they advance  is in fact the correct concept. The  study of law in Canada is not now,  and never has been, the study of  right v. wrong, fairness v. injustice.  To accept a call to the bar in Canada  is to promise to argue for justice  or injustice, accordingly as you are  paid.  It is from those persons that  judges are chosen, and it is small  wonder that the government may have  difficulty finding there persons who  have spent a great deal of time considering such matters as justice and  humanitarian principles.  Should such  persons emerge from our universities  and legal system, they are only produced as a by-product of a system  whose prime function is the preparation of the student and young lawyer  for the serious business of making  money. Affluence has become the only  standard by which our society can  agree to judge success and ability.  The abortion laws are arbitrary and  unjust, and the Morgenthaler decision  a tragedy in Canadian law. But the  men who wrote those laws and that  decision are products of our society,  which has shaped their views and limited their vision. We cannot judge  them harshly unless we judge ourselves  harshly.  I suggest that the time has  come to take a long, hard look at  ourselves our community, our laws,  our social and ethical values.  In  the next months, I'd like to take a  woman's look at the jury system, the  law on abortion and other societal  issues.  I hope you'll look with me.  - Lee Masters 9  ■or woman  A VSW member recently drew our attention to the following Guest Editorial  in the B.C. Medical Journal (Vol.17,  No.4, April 1975).  A Prescription for Women  In 1967, the United Nations declared  1975 International Women's Year.With ,  that much time for planning, you'd  . think it would have begun with more  of a splash, but the slow dribble of  interest so far no doubts indicates  the low priority the status of women  has.  When all the rest of the world's problems are solved, then — and only  then — we'll look to the special  problems of women.  Physicians know that women make up  the majority of their practice. Do  women get the priority of time and  effort that their numbers merit?  Are they being fobbed off with tranquilizers to dull the edge of the  frustration of doing equal (and often  more) work for less pay, at being  passed over for promotions, at coping alone with child-rearing, of living in a kitchen ghetto, at being  "put down" as "stupid" after putting  hubby through college?  What do women want, you may say?  Have you ever listened, really listened , long enough to find out? It  may not be a job, a career, a new  house, a trip, another baby.  It could  be simply the freedom to be.  Charity begins at home," they say. A  good start for consciousness-raising  in 1975 could be a look at (and listen to) the lonely, artificial lives  of doctors' wives, the humiliation  of the deserted wife, the low pay and  high level of responsibility of the  office receptionist, the ambiguity  of the position of "the other woman",  the pre-mastectomy patient abandoned  to her fears.  It is unlikely that the conservative  nedical profession will ever be a radical force for social change but at  least it could be less resistant to  change and to perpetuation of th  status quo.  Try listening to yourself. Have you  aver called a menopausal patient  "girl" or "honey"? Ever tell a young  roman its a "waste of time and money"  to stretch her brain at college or  university because she'll only get  narried anyway"? Ever address your  female colleagues in a letter as  'Gentlemen" instead of "Doctor" or  "Colleague"? Ever tell a woman who  Is going to lose a breast that she's  'got another"? Ever oppose pregnancy  leave and insurance because "men don't  get pregnant"? Ever say "she thinks  like a man"?  Let's approach International Women's  Year with something new in the way  of prescriptions for women. Instead  of pills to dull the mind and still  the emotions arising out of social  inequities, let's prescribe a listening ear, an open mind, a non-judgmental attitude, mixed with a large amount  of understanding*  -F-. Forrest-Richards,  MD, FRCP(C), Victoria  members"     forum  I am writing this letter on behalf  of a voice that has yet to be heard  on the question of abortion.  I have  a three month old son who requires  more of my time and attention and  care and love than I ever would have  imagined, and I give it willingly  because I want to, because I wanted  him. But what about all the little  babies who are not wanted? Do the  Right to Life People really think  they are doing them a favour by forcing them into the position of a burden to a woman who does not want to  be a mother. How many of them are  left to cry behind a slammed door  when they are hungry, or are slapped when they are crying to "give  them something to cry about."  The Right-to Life people are acting  in a totally unfair and irresponsible  manner in asking helpless innocent  babies to be born into a situation  where there will be no love for them.  What chance have they got of growing  up to be, well-balanced, well-rounded  persons, and how much compassion do  the Right for Life people have for  the delinquents of our society? Is  mere existence good enough or should  there be some hope for a quality of  life?

Telephone: 736-3746  Kinesis —  Catherine Berg's letter in Kinesis,  March/75, prompted me to voice something which I think is important. Ms.  Berg did not endorse or oppose Margaret Thatcher or Flora McDonald as politicians and was simply rejoicing that  at last women are reaching very important political positions.  My point is that I feel all women must  be wary of supporting public people  merely because they are of a particular sex. Margaret Thatcher, for example,  was (while Minister for Education in  a previous Conservative U.K. government) infamous for her elitist, reactionary policies.  She withdrew the free  milk programme from lower-income area  schools, raised subsidies for privileged private schools, and reversed  policies aiming at equalising educate  ional opportunities for all children.  Among other things, I would not support  a politician like that, regardless of  sex.  It is very easy to become trapped into  "supporting the side", as a reaction  to having not had a side to support  for so long. But we know the perils  of chauvinism, don't we?  Kay Ryan  Sorry for being so late with cheque.  Shall try to get another off to you  in a few months.  Could hardly manage' without Kinesis.  Seriously. There is nothing like it  here yet.

Dear Helpful Person:  ,  11111-11  I have worked in the same place for  over a year.  I am expecting a baby  on July 30 and I want to collect maternity benefits from UIC. Am I eligible?  How do I go about collecting  and how much do I get?

Barefoot and Pregnant  Dear Barefoot and Pregnant:  Yes, wou are eligible for maternity  benefits because you worked for more  thnn 20 weeks and you worked more than  4 weeks before your pregnancy started.  Under provincial law you can ask for  a maternity leave starting June 18.  On that day run, do not walk, to your  nearest UIC office and apply for benefits. Take your separation certificate  from the place you work and certificates  from any other places you have worked  since June 18 last year. Also take a  letter from your doctor certifying your  pregnancy and expected delivery date.  If you don't have some of these pieces  of paper, apply anyway. You will lose  benefits by waiting to apply. UIC will  accept your claim and wait for the required paper. (But remember that delays in the paperwork will cause delays in sending your cheques.)  Your benefits will be approximately  $123 per week (or 2/3 of your average  wages for the 20 weeks before June 18  if that is less.) The money is taxable so your take-home'will be nibbled down a bit.  You will have to wait two weeks for  benefits to begin. They will start  on July 6.  (UIC runs on a full week-  no fractions system.)  If you do deliver on July 30 (or any time during  or after the week of July 27 to August  2), the money will continue until  September 13. But if you deliver before July 27, you will lose money,  because the benefits will only run for  6 weeks after birth. (Nobody seems  to know what the government has against  early deliveries.)  If you add up the weeks of benefits,  you will get 10 (3 before confinement,  1 the week of confinement, and 6 thereafter) instead of the full 15 provided by law (8 before, etc) That's because of the two week waiting period  and the Maternity Protection Act provision giving you only '6:weeks leave  before delivery.  In order to collect  for the full 15 weeks you would have  to leave work 10 to 11 weeks before  delivery, not 6. That aspect of the  Maternity Protection Act needs revision badly. Also there is- a Bill in  Parliament now designed to make the  timing of maternity benefits more flexible and we are watching it closely.  One last thing there may be special  circumstances surrounding your claim  that will affect the general rules for  benefits. Check with your UIC office  before you expect to start your leave  to make sure that you are eligible and  that you can do the paperwork as fast  as possible so the money starts coming  as fast as possible. And once you  have applied, read everything UIC sends  you carefully and fill but all the forms  they ask for. Otherwise you may lose  money.

This urgently needed scheme would be  a major step in promoting the social  and economic equality of men and women  workers in the province. Human Rights  legislation can only deal with discrimination after the fact.  The AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN places the onus upon  the employer, and therefore deals directly with discriminatory attitudes.  It is important that the provincial  government be exemplary in assuring  equal opportunities for all workers.  Hopefully, the adoption of such a scheme  would be an encouragement to the private sector to follow suit. We urge  you to support AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN.  COMING IM  June  New officers of the V.S.W.
