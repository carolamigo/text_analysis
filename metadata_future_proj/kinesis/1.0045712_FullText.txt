 *m ajtr  September 1986  Midwives  Prostitution news  and analysis  Vancouver abortion  clinic proposed  Swingshift  news about women that's not in the dailies //^/////////////y/y^^^^  ////////////////////////^^^^  JCJM£SIS  CCCA working  to establish  abortion clinic  By Ann Thomson  Despite the straight jacket  imposed on the right to legal  abortions by the Criminal Code,  "the pro-choice movement continues to advance. In late May,  . a second abortion clinic was  opened in Toronto by Dr. Robert Scott. Because it is freestanding, not attached to a  hospital, such a clinic is  'illegal'. But public support  for it is so great that the  Liberal government in Ontario  has been unable to raid or  close it.  Canadians  appeal Dalkon  Shield deadline  Canadian women who have used  the Dalkon Shield will have to  wait until the fall to find  out whether an April 30th deadline for claims against A.H.  Robins, the Shield's manufacturer, will be extended.  The Vancouver Women's Health  Collective and the Winnipeg  Women's Clinic's joint application to have the deadline  extended was rejected by Virginia Bankruptcy Court in  late June. Both organizations  have decided to appeal the  decision and expect to have  the appeal heard sometime this  fall.  The groups launched their suit  because Canadian women, 1.7  million of whom had used the  Shield, received insufficient  notice from Robins about the  claims deadline. In the United  States the court imposed  claims notification program  ordered large advertisements  in all major newspapers and  magazines as well as prime  time television and radio  spots. In Canada, and elsewhere, Robins was not required to notify the public  directly through advertising  but only to notify via press  releases and letters to  health ministries and medical associations.  In addition to the appeal launched by the two women's health  organizations, individual women who did not know about the  claims deadline can join in  the appeal. Robert Manchester,  an American lawyer who has been  involved in Dalkon Shield litigation for over ten years is  acting as counsel for the  Health Collective. He will cov-  Abortion continued next page  Abortion clinics are opening  in ever greater numbers. Presently, there are approximately  fifteen clinics across the  country, despite the opposition  of the police, courts and governments .  Concerned Citizens for Choice  on Abortion (CCCA) thinks it's  Vancouver's turn. With the publication of its August newsletter, CCCA launches a drive  to establish an abortion clinic  here.  It won't open tomorrow. There's  a lot of work to be done.  Thousands of dollars are needed  to equip a clinic and renovate  premises to conform with medical codes. In Winnipeg, Toronto and Montreal, Dr. Henry  Morgentaler had to buy the  buildings that house his clinics, since no landlord would  rent space. Money for such a  project in Vancouver has yet to  be raised.  Another essential is to attract  a medical staff. So far, one  doctor who is prepared to work  in the clinic has come forward  and is working closely with  CCCA. He is willing to help  locate additional doctors and  health care workers. Since  taking this step means defying  the law, it requires considerable commitment and determination.  Unquestionably, the key factor  needed for a clinic is to  build a political climate that  will express the demand for  one and will be prepared to  defend it. This is where help  is needed from all supporters  of a woman's right to choose.  The lessons learned in opening  previous clinics can help us  in Vancouver. First of all,  let's review the reasons for  a clinic and the stakes in  opening one.  The two reasons why the spread  of clinics has proved unstoppable are that hospitals,  which have the exclusive franchise on providing legal abortions, are doing a lousy job,  and because the law that prohibits abortions outside of  hospitals has got to be changed.•  During the trial of Doctors  Morgentaler, Scott, and  Smoling, charged with offences  related to opening an abortion  clinic in Toronto in 1984, the  hazards women face in trying to  get a hospital abortion were  likened to playing Russian  roulette.  We know the story:  first,  a  woman must find a sympathetic  Dalkon continued page 3  B*i^jjStf!£|  Native Women's Centre-These services are required for the native community.  Native Women's Centre  awaits word on funding  by Noreen Howes  Vancouver's Native Women's  Family and Cultural Centre  has lost its $60,000 annual  funding from the Ministry of  Human Resources as a result  of excessive honesty on the  part of the centre's treasurer.  Bev Wilson carted the books  off to the Ministry's region  II office in Mount Pleasant  in May and exposed serious  mis-management by the old  board.  "Our money wasn't going to  our people", she said "but it  was going into the pockets of  two people  working here."  MHR's 1985 Audit Report revealed poor financial administration and improper financial  controls in place. "I wanted  to bring it to light," Wilson  added "to turn things around  and run the centre as it  should be run."  Fred Milowsky, regional manager with MHR, responded to  Wilson's information by terminating its contract. "We  have been dissatisfied with  the way it has carried out .  the program, from all points  of view" he said.  He failed to appreciate the  attempts by Wilson and others  at the Centre which immediately resulted in improvements. A  replacement board of directors  was elected, outreach attempts  found eighty paid-up members,  several programs were organized  offering essential services to  native women such as battered  women's support, legal aid (with  particular focus on child-  apprehension cases), help in  locating housing for women new  to Vancouver and various other  Wilson is upset because the  human resources ministry cut  off the centre's funds without giving the new administration sufficient time to implement policy changes.  Appeals for donations have been  sent to native organizations,  community centres and women's  groups throughout the country.  The city of Vancouver will foot  the bills until October.  Dinah Schooner, a volunteer at  the centre, says that as the  only native women's centre in  BC it's essential to keep the  doors open.  "With 30,000 registered Indians  in Vancouver alone, from working class Indians to those on  skid row, we can never begin  to scratch the surface of helping these families. The needs  are great."  Together with the United Way,  the human resources ministry  will hold a community forum  this fall to identify the heeds  of native women in the Mount-  Pleasant area and develop a  program.  Bev Wilson feels optimistic  that funding will be resumed  at this time. "MHR is just sitting back and observing us,  sort of slapping our wrists,  seeing if we'11 fold."  "It's clear," she added "these  services are required for the  native community—we'll make  it especially  clear to MHR."

Abortion from page 1  doctor who will refer her to a gynecologist  Who performs abortions; next the required  request must be made of a hospital's therapeutic abortion committee (TAC), which  can take it's sweet time about ruling on a  woman's fate. Of much greater importance  than women's needs to a TAC is likely to be  whatever quota on abortions that particular  hospital has set. Of course, no hospital  is required to set up a TAC, and across  the country some TACs exist that never, or •  seldom, approve an abortion.  In British Columbia, for example, only 52  of the province's 105 general (non-religious)  hospitals have TACs. Most are reluctant to  release data on abortions, but a survey by  the Vancouver Sun,  published in January 1985,  identified four TACs that had not approved  an abortion in years.  So the crisis of access that British Colum*-  . bians face, in common with women across the  country, is the first major reason why a  clinic is needed here.  The second reason is that, when the pro-  choice movement takes control of the facilities for terminating unwanted pregnancies,  the law that absurdly prohibits abortion  clinics is revealed as unenforceable. Opening clinics is a logical step in the now  seventeen year campaign to repeal  the supposedly reformed, but still anti-woman,  abortion law.  The small group of activists in CCCA cannot  open a clinic alone-. What we propose is  calling on all those who support a woman's  right to choose to join in an organized,  public campaign to get a clinic established.  There is an important role for clinic support groups to play. A large number of  such groups can promote the need for a  clinic, making it clear that the pro-choice  community stands behind the project. In  this way, notice can be served to the .government, the police, and the courts that  there will be fierce resistance to any raid  or laying of charges. The anti-abortionists,  who can be counted on to picket and harass  the clinic, will be served notice also.  CCCA already has more than one hundred  endorsers. Most are organizations that have  taken a democratic vote to endorse our aims.  Some of these, like the BC Federation of  Labour and some large unions, the NDP, the  YMCA, etc., are province-wide. Others, like  most of our feminist-group endorsers, are  smaller. We want to see clinic support  groups set up within our endorsers, or potential endorsers. 'Hospital Workers for  Choice', for example, or lesbian mothers,  rape crisis workers, teachers, carpenters,  day-care workers, and anyone else for choice  Clinic Support Groups can help by educating  their colleagues about the need for a  clinic, by submitting resolutions of support to policy conventions, and by helping  raise tne needed funds. CCCA sees the need  to form a coalition of such groups to get  the clinic off the ground.  If you aren't able to attend our meetings,  please take out a membership in CCCA.

Vancouver prostitutes  fear increasing violence  by Esther Shannon  In Vancouver, Canada's vacation land capital, it seems  everyone is looking for a good  time. For the city's prostitutes, however, the carnival is  increasingly a deceptive, dangerous and, for some a deadly  trap.  Donna Marie Kiss, found strangled in Surrey in late August, is  the latest victim in what signals  an increasing attack on the  city's prostitutes.  Kiss, 25 years old, had worked  in Vancouver as a prostitute  for a number of years. She was  forced out of the Seymour and  Helmeken district by a court  ordered area restriction. The  restriction was imposed by  provincial court judge Erik  Bendrodt, after Kiss had  appeared in court on two soliciting charges this spring.  Bendrodt ordered that Kiss  "not be found" in the Seymour  Street area.  According to Marie Arrington  of Prostitutes and Other Women  for Equal Rights (POWER), the  area restriction meant Kiss  was more vulnerable because it  forced her to work in an unfamiliar area.  "A prostitute in a new area"  said Arrington, "is out of her  element. She has no buddy system, doesn't know the accepted  prices and is not familiar with  the- tricks."  "We figure that Donna must  have been working by hitching  on her own out on the highway  in Surrey. Out on her own on  a Surrey highway she had no  protection."  The use of area restrictions  as a way to implement the new  anti-soliciting law, C49, is  increasingly used in Vancouver,  says Arrington.  ."Prostitution is a federal  offense, but the responsibility  to implement the law is provincial," said Arrington.  "Attorney General Brian Smith,"  she. said, "is pushing for area  restrictions and the courts  are imposing them. Area restrictions don't solve any  'problems', all they do is make  hookers more vulnerable."  Arrington says Vancouver prostitutes are dealing with a "  "whole new level of strain".  Women, she says, are more  frightened now than ever.  "A whole combination of things",  said Arrington, "has made  working on the streets more  dangerous and bizarre. There  is Expo and the tourists, the  law, the vice squad, agressive  stateside (American) pimps,  the neighbourhood vigilantes,  greater competition and weirder and weirder tricks."  "With the tourists you see  more rip-offs and assaults be-  because those men don't live  here. A woman can go back the  next day, with friends, to collect on a rip-off and the guy  is gone, he's checked out of  the hotel."  "When Expo closes down for the  night the streets are filled  with cars full of young punks  who like to cruise around and  harass the women."  "And Expo has meant that a lot  of pimps from the States have  brought up women to work in  Vancouver. These pimps are more  aggressive and more violent."  "Expo has become such a family  outing that there just isn't  as much business on the streets  as it was thought there would  be."  Across Canada and Quebec the  eighth annual Take Back the  Night march to end violence  against women is set for Friday,  September 19th. In Vancouver  this year's march, organized by  Vancouver Rape Relief and  Women's Shelter, will start at  8:30 p.m. from the Vancouver  Art Gallery, 750 Hornby. Women  only. Please pre-register for  childcare. Wheelchair attendants  available.  For more information or for  childcare registrations, please call  Vancouver Rape Relief at  872-8212  This kind of competition can  really add to a bad climate.  Some women from Vancouver have  just left while Expo is on,  they just couldn't take it."  Also, the women from the States  don't know the law here. They  don't know they can be deported,  they don't know entrapment is  legal in Canada as far as soliciting goes."  "And the vice cops are getting  more and more into it. It's  harder and harder to identify  Controversial discussions planned  Prostitutes and Other Women for  Equal Rights (POWER) made an  appeal to the women's community  for support because of the increased violence they have been -  facing since the passing of Bill  C-49. On July 4-th representatives  from a number of women's groups  met to discuss the possibility of  having a public debate on violence against women in general.  The representatives present at  the meeting expressed a strong  need to have a discussion within  the women's community on controversial issues, particularly  prostitution, which we have not  fully explored together.  Besides prostitution, topics  suggested for forums were: women  on trial (mid-wivers, natives,  lesbians), disabled women, pornography, rape, abo'rtion and  others.  The forums will start in September and should end by November..  In addition, we plan to hold a  conference where we hope to  adopt a united platform regarding issues on violence against  women.  Following is a list of forums  all of which will take place  at Langara Student Union Building, 100 W. -49th. Childcare  will be provided for all events,  the site is wheelchair accessible and interpreting will be  provided for the hearing impaired.

The province  of BC will take on administrative responsibilities for nonprofit housing (sponsored by  church groups, service clubs,  etc. ) and rent supplements  Co-ops are to be assisted under a separate federal co-op  housing program, however,  thirty percent of new housing  co-op units are to be eligible  for rent supplements. These  rent supplements are to be  directed to lower income households and will bridge the gap  between market rates and thirty percent of household incomes .  The province will cover thirty-  three percent of the costs of  these new programs;  The delay in reaching this  agreement has meant little new  affordable housing will be  created in BC this year. The  province has now issued a proposal call to potential sponsors, but no construction is  likely to begin until 1987.  them. One cop drove around in  a jeep with an open can of beer  in the car. He busted sixteen  women in one night."  "Working as a prostitute in Vancouver this summer means you're  running the whole gamut and  every day it gets worse. Last  week I put out a bad trick sheet  on a Thursday and by the weekend  I had enough new information to  put out a new one."  "The street scene is just so  bizarre it's like a bloody zoo."  DalkOII from page 1  er all legal expenses related  to the claims deadline action.  In June, 1970, Robins, based  in Virginia, began marketing  the Dalkon Shield. The team of  doctors who developed the device used false research statistics to have it approved.  Robins withdrew the Shield in "  1974 after 3.2 million had been  sold worldwide.  The Shield has been linked to  the deaths of sixteen women in  the United States. These women  developed complications from  uterine infections after  miscarriages. Lawsuits against  the company contend that the  Shield's design allowed bacteria to enter the uterus through  the strings of the IUD and  caused PID, blood poisoning,  infections, sterility and spontaneous abortions.  In an ironic comment on the  justice system the Health Collective notes that while their  deadline extension bid was  refused the bankruptcy court  has just given Robins its third  three month extension on the  time allowed the company to  reorganize its financial holdings.  The Vancouver Women's Health  Collective has established a  Dalkon Shield Women's Group to  provide information and support  to women who have used the  Shield and/or who have or intend to file a claim.  The next  meeting is slated for Sept.  18,  7:20 pm at the Vancouver Women's  Health Collective,  888 Burrard  St.,  Vancouver. For more info,  call 682-1633.  September ^ Kinesis Across B.C.  //////////////////;  India Mahila Women's Association celebrates  by Ranjit Dulai  India Mahila (Women's) Association (IMA.) hosted a centennial  celebration—East meets West—  in June at Eric Hamber Secondary School. The function was  endorsed by the Vancouver Centennial Commission and was  attended by approximately 800  people.  The festivities started with  an authentic food bazaar which  was prepared and served by the  IMA members. Sushma, an old  time friend of the IMA. started  the entertainment festivities  as Mistress of Ceremonies.  Two IMA members: Raminder  Dosanjh and Harminder Sanghera  welcomed the audience and gave  an overview of the activities,  aims and objectives of the IMA  in both English and Punjabi.  They also spoke on the concept  of Multiculturalism as viewed  by IMA.  "Our perception of a truly  multicultural society is one  where there is a concept of  mingling of people at all levels, regardless of their colour,  sex, or ethnic background. And  one of the objectives of our  organization is just that,  to ensure that we, the Indo-  Canadian women, be able to walk  shoulder to shoulder with other  Canadians.  The cultural part of the program  started with a song depicting  the vigour, strength and the  capabilities of women, sung by  Hemi on behalf of the IMA. A  lively Punjabi folk song on  the life of a contented woman .  working in the fields was pre- j  sented by Amarjit Josh.  Various folk dance groups that  participated in the gala even  ing were: Bella Domingo Polynesian Dancers; The Natraj  School of Dancing, The Strath-  cona Chinese Dance Co.; The  Ella Gallahar Highland Dancers.  The India Mahila Association  presented the Rajasthani Dance,  and the popular folk dances  of Punjab: Women's Giddha and  Bhangra.  During the show, IMA recognized  in the audience senior citizen  women of Indian origin who have  resided in Canada for over fifty  years, and other guests that  were present.  India Mahila Association is comprised of women of Indian origin  and began in 1973.  The association has developed several  areas of interest:  The Education Committee provides  information both to women and  the community in general.  The  Support Group provides emotional support and assistance to  women needing help and referral.  Presently,  with the assistance  of the Little Mountain Neighbourhood House and YWCA,  IMA is running a support group for women  at the Neighbourhood House  every Sunday at 2:20 pm.  The  Social Committee organizes recreational activities for members and their families.  The  Cultural Committee is active in  the revival and promotion of  our culture through dance,  music,  arts and crafts.  Sexism still bars scientists from success  by Karen Gram  A group of women scientists in  Vancouver recently for an international conference say sexism still plagues the laboratory.  The women, here for the International Union of Physiological  Sciences congress, say they  encounter overt discrimination  such as unfair hiring practices  as well as more subtle instances of academic and social  snobbery from male colleagues.  "It's the old boys thing," says  Elizabeth Vizsolyi, a University of BC Zoology lecturer.  "It's not a conscious thing,  men identify better with men  so they would rather work with  them."  Vizsolyi says none of the women in her department of forty  have tenure. Women are also  very under represented in university administration.  Annick Annsselin, a grad student at the University of  Sydney in Australia, says the  sexism which is prevalent in  her country makes it extremely  tough to get into the academic field. Annsselin says men  receive four times as many  research grants and scholarships as women. The women who,  do get academic recognition  are still viewed differently  by their male colleagues.  Annsselin points to one woman  teaching assistant at her  university who lost the respect of her male colleagues  when she announced her pregnancy. "They say, 'How dare  she? This is what happens  when you hire women.'"  It seems attitudes haven't  changed that much, says Janet  Trubatch, associate vice-president of research at the University of Chicago, who was  fired in the 1960s California  State University for being  pregnant.  Nadine Wilson, one of two  woman phsyiologists at UBC,  says she thinks the problem is  systemic rather than localized. Most male scientists don't  The Contemporary Saga of Little Mellon  by Terri Roberton and Harris Taylor  realize they discriminate  against women, she adds. "It  is much easier to fight something that is conscious."  Trubatch concurs, despite  receiving some academic  recognition, saying that she  had to learn how to curse before the men in her department  would talk to her.  Academically, the women say  they don't have problems getting their research accepted  on its scientific merits but  once they publish something they  are not honoured as their male  counterparts are.  "What's difficult is getting  invited to speaJ^or chair ses-  r'^M^^^r* said Trubatch.  -  She says the IUPS Congress was  a good example of that problem.  Very few women were invited  to speak and only one woman  -chaired a"session. Trubatch  attributes this to the fact  that there were no women on the  international program.which  chose the chairs.  "Look at the opening ceremony,"  she says. "There were 24 big-  cheeses there and they were  all men."  Hugh McLennan, a physiologist  at UBC and the chair of the international program committee,  says he doesn't think gender  should be considered when  choosing speakers.  "I don't think the question  of whether it is a man or a  woman matters at all. I think  (the choice of speakers) should  be left to the experts in the  field."  Turbatch, who served on a research grant council, says  women are also evaluated differently for grants. ('"Council  members) say, 'Oh she is very  good with her hands. She doesn't  need a technician.' Then when  they review her work three  years later they discover she  hasn't accomplished very much  and take away her grant."  The woman say they would like  to see more women invited to  speak and chair at the next  congress in Finland. Trubatch  would also like to see the  IUPS follow the example of the  American Psychologists and  adopt- a policy of non-sexist  language.  4      Kinesis September'86 No verdict yet for BC midwives  by Susan Rae  On May 3, 1985, baby Voth died at a homebirth attended by Vancouver midwives Mary  Sullivan and Gloria Lemay. The Voth baby  died of a rare birth complication called  shoulder dystocia which occurs after the  birth of the head, when the baby's shoulders become lodged in the mother's pelvic bones. Blood circulation to the  baby's brain is restricted and the baby  must be freed within five to seven minutes or it will be asphyxiated. This  complication is undiagnosable until it  occurs and although rare, babies die  or are damaged by shoulder dystocia in  hospitals.  On July 12, 1985 Mary and Gloria were  arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license and criminal negligence causing death and bodily harm.  After spending six hours in jail they  were released on their own recognisance  on condition that they not attend or  assist at live births.  The BC College of Physicians and Surgeons  took the opportunity to pull their files  on Gloria and Mary and filed three more  charges of practising medicine (midwifery) without a license. These charges  Prosecutor: "(Mrs. Voth) would be eligible for a home birth?"  Filippa Lugtenberg: "For a try-out at  least, yes."  The midwives were criticized for not  attending at the home as soon as labour  began with a spontaneous breaking of the  waters. The father, James Voth, testified in response to defense lawyer's  questions.  Q. "There was absolutely no doubt in your  mind that whenever you asked her to, whatever time of night it might have been,  she would have come?"  A. (Mr. Voth) "Yes and more so even that  she offered to come and we said 'not  yet'."  We now face the accounting  process and we are proud  to be midwives.  The Crown's allegations are that the  time from full dilation to the baby's  birth was too long at four and a half  hours. A recommendation by the Soeiety  of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of  . Canada has recently been made that "there  be no time limit on the second stage of  labour" and Crown witnesses had.to agree  that this was the current thinking in  obstetrics when defense lawyers read this  into the evidence.  When ambulance attendants arrived during  the crisis, the midwives instructed them  how to assist instead of immediately transporting to hospital. This action was criticized by the Crown but supported by  Crown witness Dr. James King of Grace  Hospital.  Defense ( at Preliminary Hearing ): "Would  you agree with me that one of the last  things you would do with true shoulder  dystocia is try to transport the mother  at that point given that you have this  limited time period?"  Supporters outside the courthouse.  will be dealt with upon completion of  the criminal negligence charges. The  criminal charges were brought against  Gloria and Mary by the Crown; the parents  did not bring charges and'are supporting  the midwives in this case.  The preliminary hearing took place for  seven days in October, 1985 and the  trial began in May of this year. Judge  Jane Godfrey is hearing the case and  the prosecution was completed July 2.  The prosecution began with prosecutor,  Judith Milliken hurling a long list of  accusations of negligence into the ring.  After three weeks of direct and cross-  examination of thirteen witnesses, the .  Crown's case showed many weaknesses.  Highlights of the testimony which reversed the criticisms of the midwives'  practise are:  The Crown said Mrs. Voth should not have  been permitted to have a homebirth because she was having a big baby and was  a first time mother. A Dutch midwife who  was called to testify for the Crown and  who met Mrs. Voth prior to giving testimony disagreed.  Dr. James King: "yes".  Defense: "Either get that child out or  not?"  Dr. King: "Right, one would have to do the  best one could where they were."  The trial was adjourned to August 5, when  defense counsel Peter Leask and Ruth  Sterling presented the defense. Mary and  Gloria showed incredible endurance as they  held up. and kept their cool during six  days of cross-examination, dense with  accusations and criticisms.  Defense witnesses will continue to take  the stand when the trial resumes on August 25 at Vancouver County Court. Several  birthing clients of the midwives will  testify, and three expert witnesses will  take the stand.  The defense witnesses include Dr. Marsden  Wagner, Director of Maternal and Child  Health for the World Health Organization—  Europe and North Africa; Dr. Michel Odent,  a practising surgeon and head of  Pithiviers Maternity Unit for the past  twenty years, and an internationally  famous childbirth pioneer; and Dr. David  B. Cheek, obstetrician and gynaecologist  from San Francisco, author of Clinical  Hypnosis.  Despite the stress and fear which accompany this type of legal confrontation,  Gloria and Mary wrote a letter of thanks  to supporters in October which stated:  "We are clear that being a midwife in  this community is a great-privilege. We  consciously chose this livelihood and we  knew there would be an accounting process  in the Courts should a baby die. We now  face the accounting process and we are  proud to be midwives. This is not a personal matter alone. Together we represent  many members of BC society who view birth  as a fundamental experience which must be  returned to the jurisdiction of the family".  Susan Rae is an active member of the Sul-  Hvan-LeMay Legal Action Group.  Help make this the last midwife trial  As the prosectuion of Gloria LeMay  and Mary Sullivan continues in the Vancouver County Court, it is clear the  Crown is trying to close down the operation of midwifery in BC. This trial is  part of the medical profession's campaign to suppress a growing trend•towards  home births.        M  The Sullivan-LeMay Legal Action Fund desperately needs another $29,000 to complete  fundraising. The estimated costs and  length of this trial have exceeded our original forecast by several more weeks and  thousands of dollars.  It is vital everyone get behind the struggle of Gloria and Mary and put up practical  and financial support. It is not from a  position of weakness we ask for money.  It is a point of strength and power and  we urge you to contribute to the costs of  this trial, the issues which affect the  freedom of all of us at this trial are  human rights and freedom of choice.  An acquittal will have dramatic consequences as it may well be the final tiny  straw that tilts the balance of public  debate in favour of broader reproductive  rights for women. .  Isn't it time we took some action to protest the use of the courts for vendettas  of medical associations and the apathy  of the health ministries? Why is there no  money to incorporate birth centres into  the health care system and there is  plenty of money to spend in court? The  governments of Canada and British Columbia will1likely spend up-to $30,000 in  court-related expenses to prosecute  Gloria LeMay and Mary Sullivan.  The existence of midwives is a confirmation of the power and presence of women  in this society. We are committed to the  case of Sullivan-LeMay being the last  trial of midwives in the criminal courts  of Canada. What can you do? What will you  Ask everyone you know to contribute money  to the legal fund. This is a grassroots  action which will have a far-reaching  impact on women's healthcare.

NanooseBay  Arte*** ^Wjr>  Picnicking on a  military test range  by Laurie McBride  Eight women were arrested on Sunday, August  3, when the island housing the control centre of the Nanoose naval weapons testing  range became the destination of the Nanoose  Motherpeace Action.  Nanoose Bay on Vancouver Island, is the  site of the sophisticated installation  known as the Canadian Forces Maritime  Experimental and Test Ranges (CFMETR). Under  a joint-use agreement between Canada and  the US, this has been the site of underwater weapons systems testing and development for the past 20 years.  The agreement was renewed in June to give  the US another ten years, of free use of  the range, but the campaign to end all  weapons testing here and convert the area  to peaceful purposes continues—in fact,  if anything, it's momentum has grown. The  success of the Motherpeace Action was a  good illustration of the determination  of the Nanoose Conversion Campaign (NCC)  and has sent a clear message to the base  that the campaign is anything but over..  The action began on August 2, when we set  up our tipis on the shores of Nanoose  Bay and our supporters began arriving from  all over Vancouver Island and elsewhere.  We were excited about putting up the Nanoose Peace Camp again for the weekend.  A month before, we had taken the camp down  after its full time, 466-day vigil at  Nanoose. We had decided not to fight the  landowner in an impending court case. It  seemed that we couldn't possibly have won,  and the publicity was likely to detract  from the real issues of the militarism  across the bay at CFMETR. Besides, it  felt like time to move on to some new phasi  of the campaign, since we know that we're  in this for a long time.  So, since early July, our  vigil has been carried on  aboard a 42-foot junk moored  in the bay. This had been  good symbolically, but has  limited our actual contact  with people. So it felt great    jt  to get the tipis up again (on     <jf  different land this time), hear   "Iffe*-  the honks of support from passing   ''-§£&?$):  motorists,- and watch people arriving  ^^*  to jo:  . the weekend action.  ***£TT<*i<  \  The eight of us taking part in the civil  disobedience spent Saturday afternoon together in a non-violence preparation, sharing  our feelings about- the action, role-playing  possible scenarios and developing a nonviolence code. That evening everyone—CDers,  witnesses, and support people—met in a circle after dinner to prepare for the next  day.  We were arrested, assoon, as  hfe stepped, ashorej bu-r n/e- carrkd  on /**Mediately vfrtk our-"picnic-  The sixty or so participants had come from  various places, including Cortes Island,  Victoria, and even Portland, Oregon.  People's roles in the action included witnesses on board boats and many camp  supporters, who cooked, provided childcare  and rides, and numerous other services  during the weekend.  The next morning, three large sailboats,  a kayak, three canoes and a small speedboat  left from nearby marinas and headed out to  Winchelsea Island—referred to by the military as "the heart of the range". The  Island houses a computer control and command  data centre (all equipment US-owned) and is  strictly off-limits to the public.  Working against a 15-knot wind and choppy  • seas, the "landing party" transferred into  four small dinghies, and with the witnesses  watching, rowed to the Island for a symbol-  llllll^c "picnic".  *^8||§Rb  We were arrested as soon as we  ~ -  stepped ashore, but we carried on  immediately with our ceremony,  I  managing to set our own pace  jjl^  for the action.

The military police officer in charge  seemed amazed (and perhaps even  respectful) that we planned to get  back into the same flimsy dinghies  and row out into the two-foot swell.  W^i§k$^^  Once we were safely on board the sailboats  again, everyone headed back to Nanoose Bay  to evaluate and celebrate the action. The  camp support people were waiting with lunch  ready for everyone, and spirits were high.  Why had we chosen this particular form  of action? We felt that a picnic was an  appropriate symbolic act on several  levels. Breaking bread together has always been important for a community of  people with a commitment to a common  concern. Second, we are working for a  world in which "Bread not bombs" becomes  a reality for everyone. And third, we  hope that some years from now, with conversion of Nanoose to peaceful uses,  we'll be able to return to Winchelsea  Island for another picnic, bringing our  children with us, and not having to  • break any laws to do so.  And why was the landing party exclusively  women? We wanted the Motherpeace Action  to convey our concern for the health of  our children and of the planet. On a  local level, US nuclear submarines and their  their cargo of nuclear weapons are not  welcome at Nanoose, and on a world level,  we are mindful that women and children  have been and continue to be the victims  of war, paying the price in homelessness,  hunger and despair. While political discussions and arms control negotiations  continue to be dominated by men and to  make little or no headway, women are  creating our own avenues to bring attention to the urgency of the nuclear issue.  Finally, and most important, this was a  women's action because we wanted to  plan, dream, act, and carry it out together as women. As one woman said during the non-violence preparation, "It's  great that we have actually been able  to organize this action without having  to work at keeping any men from trying  to take it over."  For the things we couldn't do alone, we  asked for help. And we received exactly  the help that was needed, no more, no  less, with no pressure to do things  differently. We were blessed with tremendous support throughout, and in the  end It feels like our double circle is  much stronger—our women's circle and  the larger spiral of which it forms a  part.

Kinesis September "86 //////////////////^^^^^  //////////////////////^^^^  Across Canada  Tourism, not sexism  by Tova Wagman  Several months ago MediaWatch  was notified by the. Canadian  Coalition Against Media Pornography (CCAMP) that the federal  Ministry of Tourism created  three advertisements to draw  American tourists to Canada.  The ads were to air on American TV and were titled: "Wild  World," "Old World," and "New  World."  All three ads contained varying degrees of sexism: nurses  in tight-fitting uniforms  gyrating to a rock beat (said  to create a feeling of safety  for potential tourists coming  to Canada). Women in: bathing  suits, short shorts, maid's  uniforms, and close-ups of  various female body parts.  There were also an obvious  invisibility of the multi cultural diversity of Canadians,  as the ads were made up almost  entirely of white people. The  "New World" advertisement in  particular was found to contain the most blatant sexism  of the three.  MediaWatch launched a national  protest campaign, with the  help of CCAMP and various individuals. We contacted several  groups across the country.  Nursing associations in particular were quite angry at the  unrealistic presentation of  nurses in the "New World" advertisement. Many groups and  individuals protested to Jack.  Murta, Tourism Minister, that  women were being used as sex  objects to sell Canadian tourism.  Six working days later Murta  went on CBC's Cross Country-  Check-up and announced they  were going to take out the  nurse's segment. That was a  start, but it was not enough.  We continued to lobby the government for changes and, although the nurse's segment had  been removed, nursing associations across the country  continued to support us.  In a letter to Murta the National Federation of Nurses' Unions  said:  We understand that the portion  of the ad has been deleted. It  should never have been includ-  ■ ed in the first place. What  continues to concern us, is  that clips of women in bathing  suits, and short skirts remain,  while the men in the commercial  remain fully clothed.  MediaWatch created an action  bulletin and sent it, across  Canada, and to groups in the  States who agreed to watch for  the ads in their cities. The  bulletin explained what the ad  was about and how people could  help us.  Eventually we received word  that the nurse's segment had  been replaced with something  and we were anxious to know  what it was. The revised edition of the ad finally arrived  in Vancouver, and I went down  to a branch of the tourism  office to view it. What I found  was quite different than I  expected.  Having formerly been 60 second  spots, all three were'now revised to thirty seconds. Ninety  seconds of sexism had been  deleted.  Although the government did  not publicize the revisions,  we were very pleased with this  success. This was an example  where many diverse groups  came together to deal with  issues of sex role stereotyping on public airwaves. There  was quite a bit of media coverage throughout the campaign,  ■and Lynn McDonald even raised  the issue in the house: "Mr.  Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Tourism.  He will know that women across  the country are outraged at  his commissioning of sexist  commercials...."  The Minister did know. He knew  enough to publicly announce,  that the nurse's segment would  be removed, and to revise all  three ads. MediaWatch acknowledges with thanks the time  and energy this action took, up  for many groups and individuals  across the country.  Glace Bay  equal pay  by Eunice Brooks  They do not make heavy water  at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia anymore, but an equal pay for  work of equal value decision  has been made concerning the  Cape Breton plant if it ever  becomes operational again.  In Halifax, the case was stayed  by the Supreme Court because  Atomic Energy of Canada appealed a ruling that a human rights  tribunal could sit in judgment  on them. The plant has been  closed since 1984, but the  original complaint was laid in  1979 in respect to sexual discrimination against the women  who worked for the heavy water  plant. The women, members of  local 916 of the Energy and  Chemical Workers Union, content  they were under-paid compared  with men at the plant.  The latest word, is that a human rights tribunal has the  power to hear a complaint of  discrimination and that word  comes from the Supreme Court.  They dismissed Atomic Energy  of Canada's application without giving reason for doing  so. The case will be the first  case of federal laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal  work.

Child abuse is increasing  by Eunice Brooks  At a. recent convention of 1200  prosecutors from all over North  America, held in Toronto, battered children was the topic.  In Toronto the number of abuse  cases at Sick Children's hospital was 734 last year up  from 475- in 1983. There were  75,000 suspected cases in Los  Angeles in a nine month period.  In Seattle the number suspected was 1,500 last year. The  prosecutors were told that the  average age for victims was 9,  while', for assailants it' was 30.  Why this abuse is only suspected and not known and stopped  was one of the questions addressed. Broken bones, burns,  sexual-abuse cases upset one  district attorney Robert Cramer Jr. of Madison County,  Alabama. He said that only four  cases of familial abuse were  taken to court in 1981, but  the number rose to 55 in 1984.  He said proof was hard to come  by without confession or several witnesses.  The victims are victimized  throughout the justice system  as they talk with doctors,  police officers, social work-  . ers and lawyers. The well-  meaning adults frighten and  intimidate the children, who  in many cases are strongly  attached to the person who  abuses them.  Cramer admitted he was tongue-  tied when faced with abused  child and the parents. He  found, at the convention that  he wasn't alone. Most of the  lawyers present expressed the  same difficulty. There was  talk of family doctors who -  'protected' the patients, both  young and old, from the law and  other doctors who refused to  testify. Doctors are the weakest link in the legal system.  Dr. Marcellina Mian, director  of Toronto's Sick Children's  Hospital spoke about the hospital's Suspected Child Abuse  and Neglect Program which had  grown to thirteen members.  The child abuse problem has  grown so fast and involves so  many elements of the medical  and legal system that any city  that does not have such a pro-~  gram is "caught in a morass  and mass confusion," Dr. Mian  said.  Precedent  is set  by Eunice Brooks  The Supreme Court of Canada  recognizes a significant contribution to a family even if  the participants have never  married. In a precedent setting award, Alex Sorochan, 80,  was ordered to give Mary  Sorochan, 71, one-third of his  $138,000 farm near Two Hills,  Alberta and also a lump sum  payment of $20,000 in recognition of the hard work she did.  In a written decision, Chief  Justice Brian Dickson said  Mrs. Sorochan had a reasonable expectation of some benefit in return for years of  raising children, hauling bales  of hay, milking cows, and. other  domestic and farmyard chores.  The seven Supreme Court judges  •were unanimous in their decision. This case began in the  Alberta Court of Appeal where  the man was awarded all the  assets. Mrs. Sorochan began  the action in 1982 while her  health was failing and the  relationship had deteriorated.  After the last appeal, a  decision was handed down al-  most immediately.   September ^6 Kinesis     7 Civic politics  by Colleen Tillmyn  Disillusioned about politics? Tired of  injustice perpetuated by our system of  government? Fed up with the sweet smiles  of smooth-talking politicians? Even if  you answer yes to all three questions,  please take a moment to consider at least  voting in the up-coming city elections,'  because there are worthwhile candidates  to support. For example:  Libby Davies, Vancouver City Council.  "I am an ordinary person. I have the  same worries and concerns as other people.  Politicians are not all the same. Some of  us are different...as a woman I have had  to prove myself, that I could do my job...  as women, we have the right to be there  (in the political process). We make up  half of the population. We need to be part  of the decision-making process so that the  priorities we have become issues."  Sue Harris, Vancouver Parks Board  "I see politics as a tool of community  organizing. My role as a politician is to  try and educate people about the actual  political process...that people can affect  that process. We can't just say democracy  Sadie Kuehn: I have faith in  people; that people working  together can make changes  and make the world a better  place to live.  works, we have to give people the practical  know-how...women, ethnic groups and low- j  income people have a harder time entering  the political process. The bureaucracy  is set up to be intimidating. We have  to make the process more accessible."  Sadie Kuehn, Vancouver School Board  "People who would like to see good city  government that is open to a broad cross  section of our community...have to be involved, they have to work and fight for  change...you don't have to be a super  person—that's good to know but hard to  keep in perspective at times...there's  a lot of sexism out there...a lot of  people perceive they can't do the job  because they are simply women or visible  minorities. I want the very best for  people and particularly for anyone who is  considered different in this society. I  have faith in people; that people working  together can make changes and make the  world a better place to live."  These three candidates all of whom have  their own unique backgrounds, are all members of the Committee of Progressive  Electors (COPE).  In 1972, Libby was nineteen when she went  to work in Vancouver's downtown eastside  setting up a low-cost food store for local  residents. At the same time her father  was involved in setting up a community  health clinic there. Both projects still  exist today and are funded by the city  f Vancouver.  "opted-out" when she decided at the  ;e of twenty-one that she wanted to see  how other people lived, and so became a  CUSO volunteer!in Papua New Guinea.  In 1948 Sadie was born into a ma- '  triachal family, presided over by  her grandmother, in the southern  United States, and grew up during  the time of the civil rights  movement in the 1950's and '60's.  Libby: "Working for DERA (Downtown  Eastside Residents Association,  founded in 1974), I came right up  against the system. I had never  been to city hall. Fighting with  city hall I learned that land-  profits came over the lives of the residents... the residents had no rights.  The attitude was that if you are poor  you are stupid and therefore giving  money to the residents, to improve  their housing for example, was said  to be 'like pouring money down rat  holes." Poor people had no representation ."  Sue: "In the mid '70's Papua New Guinea  was becoming independent. There was a lot  of social discussion about what kind of  country they wanted. I was there when it  became independent in '75. Having seen a  country where people were illiterate and  ballot boxes had to be flown in,  ■o and knowing that I couldn't partic-  S ipate, I came back to Canada to  g    exercise my right to vote. I had  ac never voted before. When I came  g> back I saw things differently...  g the greed of capitalism—people  | who had food and people who didn't.  Sadie: "My family was always concerned, not necessarily overtly  political, because It's not easy  to be that way when you are a  visible minority but concerned  about our own people while recognizing a commonality in all people  and fighting for change in society  as a whole... there was a clear  connection between the southern USA and  South Africa. Everyone recognized it would  be a long struggle. We had to believe in  ourselves."  Now in 1986 we find these three women  occupying positions in three different  city government bodies. Libby talks about  the changes that have taken place at city  hall. In the past, for an ordinary person,  it was next to impossible to express an  opinion at council. The only person who,  supported and understood the concerns of  groups like DERA was Harry Rankin, who  ran thirteen times before being elected.  Now, in council, there is a much broader  representation of various sectors of the  population. Now, more and more ordinary  citizens do make their way to city hall  to express their views. Harry Rankin is  running for mayor this year and there are  more progressive members on council. Due  to COPE, city government has changed to  become more of a participatory democracy.  The city takes a progressive stance  and acts on issues such as the  peace movement, struggle for jobs,  maintaining services etc...  Likewise Sue recalls the time when  there was only one progressive  voice on the parks board. Her motions were never recorded because  no one would ever second them. Now  there are three progressive voices  on the board. Not only do they get  motions seconded and recorded,  they have also managed to gain the  support of other board members on  some issues.  Sue Harris: My role as a  politician is to try and educate  people about the actual political  process. . . that people can  affect that process.  "imExt^  Sue also points out that because of COPE's  commitment to making the political process  more accessible, the public has become more  .politicized. More delegations are asking  more questions and this in turn has made  the parks board more accountable to the  public for their actions. More people know  that everyone: has the right to express  their opinion on what their community centre's needs are, for example, and many  now question why some centres have so much  and others so little. This type of participation represents major change.  Major changes have also occurred at the  school board. Sadie describes how she was  so angry and disgusted at the destruction  of education in BC that she decided to enter  political life, as part of a group of people  (COPE), "who had put themselves on the line  in terms of their concerns for the future  of young people."  They wanted to stop seeing children used  as pawns in a political game. That's why  they protested about more cuts in spending  and the removal of the elected board.  Recently many delegations have appeared  before the school board who, in the past,  have not felt comfortable talking to people  "they perceive as being highly educated."  And recently the board, students and other  people won a victory from the transit  system. They stopped them charging  $2.50 to students which is very important,  because many .students don't have the money  to pay. The board is trying to look out  for the people under its care.  Accessibility and participatory democracy ;  are running themes in the conversation of  each of these women. COPE represents, these  values for them, its philosophy and in its  practice of becoming more community based.  COPE's policies are very specific and their  issues are clear so the candidates know  where they are coming from and also that  they have a broad base of support.  Libbie: "We have to pay special attention  to those who have not been involved and  help them to get involved. Everyone in  COPE understands this."  Sue: "I thought I could run with a group of  people (COPE) because we all have the same  philosophy: to make life better for the  working people of Vancouver."  City Hall continued page 16  Libby Davies: As women we  have the right to be in the  political process: we make up  half the population.

After many needless  adventures I got my license and subsequently I got the job driving a school bus.  That's how I met Sophia.  Sophia is the mother of Peter. Peter is  this kid on my bus. I should mention that  kids who take the bus to school all go  to special classes or special schools.  They may be mentally or physically disabled  or emotionaly disturbed or a combination  of these or all three. Peter has a great  smile and intelligent eyes but their  connection to the rest of his body is  very tenuous.  He sits in a wheelchair with a big board  in front of him. It has many little squares  with words in them. Numbers, days, times,  relationships—mother, father, friend,  sister, brother, the names of his teachers and teachers' aids, the hospitals and  schools he frequents, feelings—happy,  mad, pain; parts of the body; things  that might come up in a conversation with  Peter. With a great deal of concentration-  and some flopping around Peter can point  to the words on his board.  Also he is learning to talk. He can say  a quite recognizable "yes" and "no".  People who know him better can understand  more of his words. Peter is eight and  he has been this way since birth. Sophia  and her husband have Peter and one other  boy who is five. I know hardly anything  about their life, but I do know that someone has to get Peter up and dressed and  take him to the bathroom and make sure  -Q  Hear Ye I  Hear Ye!

This is something  that will never change in Peter's lifetime except for the school bus.  Sometimes I drop Sophia at the bus stop  on her way to clean houses on the other  side of town. Sometimes she talks about  the future, but she doesn't have a lot  to say, she shrugs her shoulders, holds  her purse and says, "I don't know". She  doesn't really know what they will do  when Peter gets too big for them to lift.  Actually, she doesn't even know what she'll  do now that her other son has started  kindergarten.

This means that all couples who  have English divorces are still  legally married. Before the  referendum deserted wives  chained themselves to the parliament building's railings,  pleading for a "yes" vote.. In  the larger cities and the capital, Dublin, the vote was in  favor, but the country people  had their way. The Catholic  church had its way.  The Catholic bishops issued a  statement that people should  remember their consciences in  the vote and an informed conscience is one which votes  according to church teaching.  They made it clear that a  "yes" vote would be to deny  Christ.  One Catholic priest twisted the  words of the poet Yeats to say:  "Romantic Ireland is dead and  gone; it is with the liberals  in the grave."  Children were told in the  schools that if divorce was  introduced they would lose .  their mommy or their daddy, as  though every marriage was on  the verge of break-up. The  slogan: "Protect the innocent  family—vote no" was posted on  poles and run in full page  newspaper advertisements.  The Irish Prime Minister ran an  advertisement in each of the  morning papers on voting day  which read: "I call on the women of Ireland to vote 'yes'.  You are being misled—I can  assure your interest."  This ad was in response to a  fear campaign which told women  that divorce would impoverish  them. It told women that while  separation offered hope, divorce would only add to unhap-  piness. Some women were taken  in. In one area, Wexford, a  list of deserted wives were  contacted and told that if  divorce was introduced they  would lose -their social welfare  benefit. Such a list could only  have been available with collu-  of government agencies.  he statement was-untrue.  fter the official vote was  announced, the leader of the  Fianna Fail party was on the  radio saying that now that  divorce,was out of the way, he  would like to see the nullity  laws extended to help people  who are in tragic situations.  Since nullity means that no  marriage really existed, any  children as a result of the  union are illegitimate.  And after the official vote was  announced the figures showed  that the turnout was on sixty-  two percent, so that the ban  was upheld by just thirty-nine !  percent of the population. It  was noted -that this vote almost  duplicated one to amend abortion laws last year. The sharp  division is between urban and  country people.  For the first time, in Ireland,  this year's census asked the  question: "are you separated,  deserted, or divorced." When  the census figures are published, the picture will be  more complete on the state of  the Irish family.  In the interval, the term 'deserted wife' still applies.  Women have no chance to see  themselves as anything but  victims.  Don't come  home a-drinkin'  by Eunice Brooks  Since the beginning of this  year, women in the foothills  of the Himalayas have been  protesting the increase in  the number of licenced government liquor stores in the isolated villages. The women say  the men are drunk by early  evening, and abuse women both  physically and emotionally.  Sometimes the familial beatings are not only ignored by  local police, but encouraged  as a sort of spectator sport.  . Five hundred women marched to  one district's headquarters  to demand a reduction in the  number of liquor licences. The  Collector (official) insulted  them by calling them illiterate  village women. Their leader  demanded and got an apology. ■  She also got a commitment in  writing to move or close three  of the liquor shops.  April 1st, the day for the new  licenses to be issued, the  women staged a sit-in at the  Collector's office. When a  truck of liquor supplies arrived, it was hijacked by the  women, who refused to let it  move or be unloaded.  After a day of negotiations  the liquor shop owner agreed  to move his shop out of the  village.  In October new licences must  be applied for. The women plan  to turn out in force and take  a three day walk to the capital. Those who are farm women  will have to take cows and  buffalos with them, because  the men do not milk domestic  animals.  Condom country tests Pill  by Nancy Pollak  When it comes to contraception,  Japan is condom country. They're  freely advertised on TV, and an  estimated seventy-eight percent  of people practicing birth  control practice with condoms.  But this may change with the  recent announcement by the  Health and Welfare ministry,  that clinical tests on the  birth control pill will begin  this year.  Japan is a rarity among nations  in having thus far steered  clear of the pill for contraceptive purposes (it is used  for various gynecological conditions). The decision by  Health officials to allow testing of low-hormone pills means  that another four to ten years  may elapse before legalization.  Recent American studies, including an investigation involving over 9,000 women,  suggest that there is, at  present, no evidence that the  pill is linked to breast cancer.  The introduction to the report  did state, however, that life-,  long effects of the pill are  still unknown, and that the  pill does increase the chances  of blood clots, liver cancer  and possibly heart attacks.  Meanwhile, Japan's relatively  liberal law is periodically  menaced by anti-choice forces  The present law—the Eugencies  Protection Act of 1948—permits abortion in any of the  following conditions: either  parents has a form of mental  disorder (sic) or hereditary  deformity; either parent or  close relative has leprosy;  the pregnancy is the result  of rape or coercion; and the  pregnancy is likely to be  harmful to the mother either  physically or financially.  It is estimated that, last  year, half a million Japanese  women received legal abortions1  and another million and a half  went the illegal route (only  certain doctors are legally  allowed to do abortions). Well)  over ten percent of those  women were in their teens.  The 'financial harm1 condition!  is not without opponents, and  as recently as 1983 a member  of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed an  amendment to eliminate this  clause. The proposal has yet  to be presented in the Diet,  the Japanese parliament.  American Pro-Lifers open  3,000 pseudo-abortion clinics  by Eunice Brooks  South of the border, some 3000  pseudo-abortion clinics have  been opened by pro-lifers who  lure pregnant women to the  clinics with promises of free  pregnancy tests. The movement  was started by a wealthy Catholic  Robert J. Pearson, who distributed a 93-page booklet entitled  'fHow to Start and Operate Your  Own Pro-Life Outreach Crisis  Center."  Pearson urges the use of names  to fool women, names such as  'Pregnancy Problem Center.'  Pearson advises his followers  there is nothing wrong with  failing to reveal a pro-life  position.  According to one woman, Eleanor  Bader, the experience she had  at one of the bogus clinics is  unforgettable. She was shown  a 25 minute slide show featuring dismembered babies, bloody  fetuses, women in emotional  anguish, and all the while  she was being told lies about  side effects cf abortion such  as permanent- sterilization,  the requirement of blood transfusions, and other propaganda.  Women who go to the clinics are  offered a place to reside during pregnancy, free maternity  clothing, and in some cases  employment, if only they will  agree to go full term with  the pregnancy. One woman who  refused to stay says that a  clinic counsellor got down on  her knees and prayed aloud  that god forgive the woman for  even considering an abortion.  Eleanor Bader says the emotional impact of these fanatical  people whould never be underestimated. She says the images  from the slide show come back  to haunt her still; even though  she recognized them for propaganda, and as false images of  a human fetus. Bader says women  are vulnerable, and sometimes  wish for guidance when an  abortion is necessary. When  only one choice is given, and  that is to carry to full term,  what the clinics offer is  wrong.  Pro-choicers are frustrated by  the legal system's failure to  stop the spread of phony clinics. Money for the clinic is  reputed to come from other  places besides the Pearson  Foundations, places such as  Birthright, Right to Life,  the Protestant Christian Action Council, and according to  the US Catholic Conference,  the church has put up $734,876  for pro-life activity in  1986.  10   Kinesis September^ International,  Peru  Working against domestic violence  by Carolina Carlessi  A Peruvian woman kept quiet to save her  pride, for lack of alternatives, out of  fear, to protect her children. Today an  idea is taking hold that this attitude not only maintains but also  aggravates domestic violence. Women have  begun to speak out and to search for  alternatives.  "When my husband beat me, I crossed my  arms and let him hit me. Only when the  blood flowed onto the bed or the floor  would he see what he was doing and he'd  leave. I didn't want to lower myself by  crying in front of him. I never did  like to let on that there were problems  or that I was poor. I don't want to be  humiliated," says a miner's wife.  Feminist groups that have given free  legal counselling over the past two  years confirm, with great concern, that  the phenomena of violence against women  in the home is alarmingly increased.  Thirty percent of the women come to Man-  Uela Ramos Movement's legal service ex-  presssly to condemn abuse by their  husbands. Other cases frequently dealt with  separation, child support and abandonment  and show that abuse is almost unfailingly  involved. Gina Yanez, member of the legal  counselling team believes that violence is  a consistent component of many couple relationships, "it's as common as saying  'T love you"', she suggests.  Jealousy", a double justification which  ignores the horrendous death of a woman  at the hands of her husband.  Women's testimonies suggest that the  beatings are premeditated: "He knows how  to beat me so that the marks don't show;  he hits me on the chest and stomach",  attests a University student.  Zoila Hernandez, sociologist from Lima  and director of the magazine Mujer y  Sociedad  is putting together a book of  testimonies of the women of the Caharia  Mines from the convulsed Andean province  of Ayacucho. The women accompanied the  miners in a sacrificial march, on foot,  the 759 kilometers into Lima to aid in  their struggle for salary increases  When the mining women speak of their  personal lives they remember their mothers  being beaten.  My mother was severely kicked by my  father,  he slapped her until she had  bruises all over her body; she waited on  him anyway.  When he beat me, 'sometimes  she remained quiet—if she spoke up for me  he would beat us all. But then,  all men  beat their women:'  They remember experiences with ex-husbands.  My first husband was a batterer. He abused  me often and I couldn't take it. I'm a  humble woman but I have my character. Once  I went deaf from so many punches.  Some of the leaders of the Housewives  ■ Committee of the Canaria Mines came to the  When my father beat me, sometimes my mother remained quiet-if she  spoke up forme, he would beat us all. But then all men beat their women.  Roxana Vasquez of the legal team of  the Flora Tristan Center says that  taking into account the abuse cases as  well as the violence present in other  types of cases, aggression is the most  common complaint of women. "In almost  every case history of separation on  divorce, there is a problem of violence",  she declares.  Today in Peru a number of myths cover  up the fact that domestic violence is  part of everyday life.  The economic crisis is a good scape- '  goat. If men beat their women they  must be frustrated, unemployed and the  "'money doesn't stretch to cover family  needs.  Maltreatment of women is neither new  nor exclusive of crisis times, urbanization and over-crowded living conditions. Many of the women who today reach  the feminist centers for help have been  battered for decades. Employed and  unemployed, labourers and professionals,  in times of crisis, tranquility and  booms, men beat women.  Complaints of abuse don't only come from  impoverished homes; there is abuse in  all economic sectors. The difference is  that a professional woman, for example,  will wait a few -days before going for  help—at least until the bruises disappear.  Women from popular sectors sometimes  show.up bleeding from cuts caused from  their partners.  They use the pretext that alcohol or  jealousy justifies the offense. Newspapers  announce: "Drunken Policeman Kills in  taping sessions with bruises or wounds from  the blows of their partners.  Even here in Lima,   in the camp,  he punched  me in the face and he broke my lip open  and I couldn 't get him back because we were  in the tent—and a small one.  Some of the intellectuals and trade unionists that read the manuscript advised  Hernandez to take out "all that stuff about  beatings" because it might take away from  the "heroism" of the miner women's struggle. '  Until now, the subject of violence in the  home has been a difficult and elusive  topic for the social sciences.  In their study of abuse in Chimbote, a  particularly violent port city in the north  of the country, the young psychologists  Irma Ganoza and Flor Borja find that abused  women don't want to talk; they withdraw  their denunciations; they don't use the  legal and psychological service offered by  the Women's House (shelter); that doctors  don't register the real cause of the  wounds; the commissary paternally suggests:  "but young ladies, it's a bedroom problem,  you'll see; that woman will soon be back  with her husband" . And it' s true.        js!  Domestic violence against women is intensifying today as women break new ground,  as they broaden physical and. mental horizons.  In the pueblosojbvenes (settlements  around large cities).it's women who are  aggressively responding to the economic  crisis. They have organized themselves  to feed their families collectively, to  improve their living conditions. As  women increasingly leave the home, their  sex and class consciousness takes a huge  leap. They'know that working collectively  is. important as is overcoming personal  problems.  Many women arrive at work meetings  bleeding, sometimes without shoes or  money because their husbands thought  that by taking them away they could  stop the women from attending the meeting. Leaders of comedores populares  (communal kitchens where the food costs  are reduced and domestic work is collectivized) from Chimbote relate that if  a woman misses out on her turn or her  obligations it means she has been battered by her husband.  But if women's entrance into the public  world increases domestic violence, it is  within female organizations that the  possiblility exists of overcoming the  situation. It is by shedding light on  private life that the political and  collective struggle can begin against  this endemic ill.  In Ollaytay, a pueblo joven south of  Lima, the women organized in a collective kitchen go, as a group, to recriminate the wife beater. In other zones,  when a woman is being assaulted she  blows a whistle and other women run to  her rescue.  It's in collective strategies that disadvantaged women—the great majority  of women in Peru—are themselves glimpsing solutions.  The work of the feminist groups supports  their efforts. Centers help individually  in legal and psychological aspects, promote the discussion of alternatives and  offer solidarity to women. By studying  and denouncing violence against women  they push the social sciences towards  a better informed vision of the reality  and sensitize public, opinion in the face  of this generalized abuse of human rights.

September U6 Kinesis    11 Prostitution  Prostitution,  by Megan Ellis  As recent legislation has pushed women on  the street further up against the wall,  groups organized.by or in support of prostitutes have demanded support from feminist  organizations. Because many women's groups  have long-standing' policy in support of  decriminalization of soliciting, this response has often been a mere reiteration of  those old positions. Support has rarely  meant either a re-thinking of those positions  or positive action to see that they become  a reality.  I attended the last general meeting of the  National Action Committee on the Status  of Women (which purports to represent over  450 women's groups and over 3,000,000  Canadian women). What happened there provides an excellent example of this process.  Approached by a group of prostitutes called  Canadian Organization for the Rights of  Prostitutes (CORP), the NAC delegates were  asked to pass an emergency resolution  calling for the repeal of Bill C-49; and  the repeal of "any legislation which  seeks to limit the choices in the business  and personal lives of adult prostitutes  including procuring, pimping and bawdy  house laws." The third part of the resolution reads:  And whereas, given the problems .inherent  in the current world commodity system,  sexual prostitution is as valid an occupation  as any other.  It currently represents the  provision of a legitimate and necessary  service which should be equally available  to both men and women (since levels of  sexual need and/or opportunity can never  be,  nor should ever be,   standardized).  However the proper provision of service  requires the removal of the profession  from its current oppressive and corrupt  situation,   therefore be it resolved that  NAC recognize the crucial role of prostitutes in establishing and carrying out  their priorities as they struggle for  empowerment in their working environment.  After.little discussion, almost none of  which was on the content' of the motion  itself, the resolution was passed. Although  a count was not taken, my perception was  that more women abstained than voted in  favour. While those abstentions may have  been for any number of reasons, I believe  they were due, in part, to an ambivalence  in the women's movement, around the issue  of prostitution, which we have been reluctant to confront.  Prostitution and men  Is the demand for sex  next customer. I recognized that for half  the population she was something which  they would look over, sum up, query the  price of and think about deciding to buy,  as I might buy a new pair of shoes. I  thought about what a feeling of power that  must give them—and I didn't want to  have it.  Many of us do not understand how and why  women 'sell sex'. In particular, those  of us who are white, middle class, and  not sexual abuse survivors, are often  able to avoid facing the question. We  may be aware of some of the dangers  faced by those women; the dangers of  rape, of police harassment, of beatings,  or jail and of murder.  We may be puzzled by the different views  expressed by prostitutes -about why they  do it—some say they have no choice,  it is an economic necessity, others say  they choose it as their employment, it  is work like any other Work, and work  which should be respected. Some point  out that they sell sex for money, while  other women sell sex for other things,  including economic security in marriage.  Still others say that they are meeting  the sexual.needs of men that other  women will not meet, thereby protecting  other women from the demands of male  sexuality.  Based on what prostitutes and ex-prostitutes have said, out loud and in print,  I have come to the tentative conclusion  that prostitution, for the majority of  these women, is a choice among a relatively small number of choices. Acknowledging that the choices are even fewer  for poor women and women of colour, for  the women who do this work it is preferable to the other limited number of  options' available to them. To that extent it is a question of economics.  However, for the many women whose sexuality was stolen from them, twisted  and used against them by the men who  both inside and outside the women's movement,  that it is rational and inevitable that men  seek access to sex where and when they can  get it, even if they have to pay for it.  This assumption has meant that, unlike our  analysis of many other feminist issues, we  have directed attention away from those  who are the cause—we have focused on the  exploited and left the exploiters unassailed.  I think we must begin to look at these men  and what they do, as the first step to understanding prostitution as an instution. I  think we must start by asking—what are men  buying when they buy the time with a prostitute?  One of the things we learned through our  work with rape victims is that men who rape,  contrary to popular (and many of our own)  assumptions were not'stealing sex'. In fact  we discovered that most men do not ejacu-  I recognized that for half the population she was some fh/ngwhich  they would look over, sum up, query ihe price of and think about  deciding to buy, as I might buy a new pair of shoes.  I was first faced with my own ambivalence  a number of years ago. By chance, walking  through the red light district in Amsterdam, I came upon a woman sitting in a  window. Now that was no surprise; I had  known that some women working as prostitutes  sit in windows in Amsterdam. Having accepted the argument, in favour of decriminalization of prostitution, and having lived near  red light districts in other cities, I  t expect to be shocked. But I was.  •e was something so  objectifying about  s woman sitting in a window. Unlike  the women who stand, walk, talk to each  other on the streets this woman sat passively, waiting to be bought, like'any other of  a number of consumer goods which one sees  in the windows of shops. Seated behind  glass, unchanging expression, she waited,  without appearing to be waiting, for the  abused them as children, the sale of  sex becomes a much more viable option.  Young women often leave home having •  learned that they are for the sexual use  of others and good for nothing else. From  there it is no great leap to learn to make  a living selling the only part of them  which they have been taught to believe has  any value. In view of the fact that the  majority of prostitutes, both male and  female, are survivors of sexual abuse, the  very idea of choice, as well as the range  of options, is. a narrow one.  But whether or not this is an accurate  understanding of why women and children  work in prostitution—.the supply side of  the equation—what I really think we need  to look at is the demand side of the equation: the men who are the buyers. There has  been what I think is an unstated assumption,  late in the course of a rape; rape is not  for the purpose of sexual satisfaction.  Instead we found rape is about power,  about the power of control and degradation,  about glorifying masculinity through exploiting women's vulnerability, about  subordinating women because of and through  sex.  So is it possible that men are not buying  sexual gratification when they buy time  from a prostitute—that they are getting  something else when they, pay the $20 to  $150 plus, something other than they could  get in their own bathrooms for free?  I think that what men are buying is what  some prostitutes have labelled fantasy,  but it is fantasy which men choose to be  true and then label as "normal". Fantasy  which says that sex is about what they  want it to be about, that women's sexuality  is nothing more or less than that which  gets men off, and that women really are for  the buying and selling.  Men buy women who will tell them they are  wonderful lovers, that every move they make  is exactly what satisfies women, and that  women can be had anytime they want, for a  few dollars a time. Men buy the same child  who, raped by her father at age ten will,  five years later, tell them that she has  orgasms at their every thrust inside her—  and that any woman would. Men buy women  who will, in the flesh, reinforce all the  lies of pornography. Men buy. women to make  pornography real. :.-■■ J   12   Kinesis September 1  or power?  So is it real or is it fantasy? Is it the  woman in the hotel bedroom who is telling  him the truth, or is it his wife (if she  dares speak about her sexuality at all)?  Is it the woman on the streetcorner or is  it the feminist artists who are portraying  what women's sexuality is really about?  Given the choice (and men do have the choice)  between the understanding of women as full  and complete human beings, whose sexuality  has its own complicated demands (among  which experiencing pleasure with men may or  may not be included), and the understanding  of women as for consumption by men, it  would not be surprising if men opted for the  latter. The latter is the dominant view, it  is the view of 'male-ist' popular culture,  it is, after all, 'natural'. It is also a  good deal cheaper than equal pay for work  of equal value.  Understanding women as for the consumption  of men, as less than human, as objects rather  than subjects, as sexual subordinates,  allows men to continue to rape, batter, sexually harass, and murder, to justify and  perpetuate all the activities of the colonizers upon the colonized.  The institution of prostitution is an institution which elevates male sexuality as the  subordination of women to. the level of a religion. For a mere $20 you can get a promise  of eternal erections and eternal control.  Pornography as an industry lies about women's  sexuality, prostitution as an industry feeds  and echoes that lie. "One promises, the other  delivers." (1) And lying about our sexuality  has far broader ramifications for women than  just the question of what we do in bed, for  it is. in and through our sexuality that we  are subordinated. It is through the appropriation and characterization of our sexuality  that we are defined as other men, as less  than men, and as deserving of the treatment  meted out to us. As long as our sexuality is  not our own, to be a woman is to be for men,  as the women in pornography and prostitution  are for.men. The universal!zation of a sexuality of women that is for men, defines us  all as subordinate, worthy of being exploited,  used and abused by men.  For this reason we cannot examine the  labour performed by prostitutes -as something separate from the industry of prostitution. And while it is important to work to  increase protection against dangers faced  by women who do that labour, that is not the  same thing as working to protect their jobs.  The issue of prostitution is not just about  conditions of work, it is also about the  nature of the work, and the consequences of  the work for all women.  To work for safer conditions for workers in  the arms industry, for example, is not contradictory to working to abolish the industry itself. It is crucial that we avoid  getting sidetracked from our efforts to  abolish an industry which is ultimately  destructive—to women in the case of prostitution, to the human race in the cases  of the arms industry—because abolition  would put the workers out of work. However,  work on abolition must include work to  provide alternatives to the workers who  leave either by choice, or, more hopefully,  because the industry eventually ceases to  exist.  Women's groups have chosen to demand the  repeal of laws relating to the buying and  selling of sex, in an attempt to end the  further victimization of prostitutes by  police and the courts. Decriminalization  implies that neither the state nor anyone  else should interfere in the buying and  selling of women's bodies. It suggests  that prostitution should be seen as a form  of private commercial exchange permitted,  but uncontrolled. Control, or legalization,  has been opposed by feminists on the  grounds that it would simply substitute  the state for the pimp and result in even  greater control and abuse of prostitutes.  Many women who support decriminalization  are critical of the prostitution industry  but hope that other measures—equal pay,  improved access to education and social  services—will gradually extend the range  of choices to women, who will then be able  to find other ways of making a living. But  this analysis overlooks the likelihood that  decriminalization will be seen as legitimization. It also ignores the demand for  prostitution and the likelihood,that there  will, even under improved conditions, be  men who will be willing to pay for the  sexual■control of women. And if the supply  is inadequate here, they will import women  from the third world, or go elsewhere.  To talk about demand, to look at the question of what men are buying, means approaching the question of what should be.done  rather differently. First, it means that  we have to try to name what is going on.  There are no words for what these men do;  selling is prostitution—what is buying?  The only words to describe them are those  of the street—'tricks', 'Johns' or the  value-neutral 'customers'. There is not  even a word which suggests any negative  connotations about the men who pay to  fuck women and children.  Second, it means asking ourselves whether  we want what these men do to be treated  as a private commercial exchange—buying  the myth that it is somehow a contract  between two equal parties.  If we don't want what these men do to be  treated as their own private business  transaction, if we accept the view that  freedom for women does not mean freedom  for men to buy women's bodies, we can de  mand that buying or offering to buy 'sex'  becomes a crime, and that selling or offering to sell be decriminalized. Prosecuting  the Johns, the pimps and the procurers  would target the men who traffic in lies  and in women's bodies, would target the  men who manufacture and market women as  sex for men. Ending the prosecution of  the women who are packaged and marketed  as sex for men, would be one step toward  stopping blaming women for what men do.  This is not a new suggestion. It was proposed by Susan Brownmiller in 1971, (2)  and most recently by the authors of A  Feminist Review of Criminal Law  (3). I  •think it is a suggestion which starts  from trying to recognize and to speak  about the truth of what prostitution is and  who is responsible for it.  Although I do not believe that the men of  the state would give serious consideration  to penalizing this common male behaviour,  I do think, raising this demand gives us  the opportunity to- identify those who are  really responsible. I think it will be  useful to developing a framework in which  we can work toward stopping the harassment  of"women, while refusing to accept legitimization of the industry of prostitution  Most importantly, we can target for blame  those who gain power and profit at the  expense of all women.  But suggestions for legal reform are only  a small part of the work which needs to be  done. We need to better understand what  the buying of women is really about, and  to look at the connections between this and  other forms of sexual exploitation of women,  We need to piece together from all women's  experiences the meaning and the methods  of our sexual subordination, of how our  power is taken away—and, most importantly,  how to get it back.

Co-osm&4  - A*^wxk m^BBLwmV     -<#«^s^s  by Jean Swanson  Since the early '60's low income people   \  have worked for a guaranteed annual income (GAI). We thought it would provide  enough money for a decent life above the  '  poverty line. We thought it would be  given with dignity and no hassle. We also !  thought that if we were able to work out- s]  side the home, decent jobs at decent wages ,  would be available.  Recently, quite a few big business groups I  have jumped on the GAI bandwagon—groups  ]  not known for supporting low-income  people. They include the Fraser Institute, ]  representing over 400 large corporations;  ' the Canadian Manufacturers Association  (CMA), a lobby group for Canada's largest  manufacturers; the MacDonald Commission,  a $20 million Royal Commission on the  economy set up by the Liberal 'Government;  and the Financial Post,  a weekly newspaper which represents business thinking  in Canada.  But business doesn't want the same kind  of GAI that low income people want. They  don't want a GAI that will end poverty.  They want a GAI that will guarantee poverty for people who can't work and help  pull down wages for people who do work.  Big business wants a GAI which helps build  a pool of cheap labour so that people on  GAI compete for low paying jobs.  There are four parts to the business ver-  f sion of GAI:  JJ^'  jrx-oDaDJ.y there's no single word or phrase  that will end poverty. If there was, business would hire pollsters and public re-^  lations experts to take over that word or  phrase and put their meaning to it, like  they're taking over Guaranteed Annual In-  We need to be sure that whatever phrase  used, the results will end poverty, not  increase it. Anti-poverty groups  ning to realize that  in  sS-m'M  ^^^Bce of  ^rnm*  Why doesn't business want GAI rates above  the poverty line? According to one report  (GATTfly, May, 1986) some business leaders  fear that people receiving adequate welfare or GAI will not work at "unsafe, low-  paying jobs unless wages and working conditions are improved. Such improvements  at the bottom of the employment ladder  would push up  the whole wage and working  f  conditions scale."  3. Keep what you earn:  The Financial Post,  the MacDonald Commission, and Fraser Institute argue that taking away earned  income from people who receive the GAI  or even welfare creates a "poverty trap"  and destroys "incentives to work." This  . sounds exactly like what low income  people have been saying for a long time  too. We have wanted to be able to keep  much more of what we earn without having  it deducted from our monthly welfare payment.  But there is another part of.the big business version of GAI that makes a high  earnings exemption dangerous for low income people, as the following explains.  4. No increase in the minimum wage: The  Fraser Institute is famous for calling an  end to minimum wage (in BC $3.65 per hour  for adults, $3.00 per hour for people under 18). The CMA told the MacDonald Commission the same: the government should  loofeen up on laws such as minimum wage  For you, the answer is no  Donalds and other low wage employers  ' '' ", than the old  the GAI will be better ;  welfare. Without legislation boosting  minimum wages, and with hundreds of  thousands of more people forced to compete for low wage work by the GAI rates,  employers will have no trouble keeping  wages low. The money that they paid for  wages in the past can now go into acquiring more assets and more control over  the economy. Much of the extra profit  for multinational companies could even  flow out of the country.  are begin- g^  But for Mac-   jjjgig should include a T^Z  oTme'SSeT ^^f  We need:  m  i  fay  1. Abolish what we have:  The Financial  Post  calls our existing system a "mo:  of conflicting and confusing social  programs" and notes (disapprovingly) the  $£n vini- annual cost. The MacDonald  $60'billi,  Commission lists the   ^ uiic programs on the  chopping block: family allowance, child  tax credit, Guaranteed Income Supplement  for seniors (this is the program that  is responsible for almost getting seniors  out of poverty), social housing, married  and child tax exemptions, the federal  share of welfare payments to provinces  (about half of the money paid by provinces on these services), and unemployment  insurance.  Business thinks these programs cost too  much and contribute to the deficit. In  fact, Canada's social spending is already  way below the average of industrial countries. As well, many economists say that  the deficit is not too high, and if it  was, it could be contained by reducing  handouts to private corporations.  2. Low incomes for people who don 't or  can't work: The MacDonald Commission  suggests $2750 per year in one option and  $3825 in another. This would, presumably,  be topped up at the whim of provincial  governments. For comparison, the poverty  line is around $Q non *-  per per-  For comparii,^xi, oxie  is around $9,000 to $10,000  son per year.  The Canadian Manufacturers Association  (CMA) provides another clue to the level  of income that business thinks people outside the paid labour force should have  They say the GAI should  ients will be better  ing income "  ensure that "recip-  ' working and earn-  14   Kinesis September ^6  Business doesn't like minimum wages because, like welfare payments, they push  up the bottom of the wage scale ladder,  putting more money into workers hands  than.business profits.  What would the effect of a GAI with  these four ingredients be? Before con^  sidering this, remember that most  poor  people work in the paid labour force.  They're poor because their wages are  too low and/or their hours too few.  Imagine that big "business gets its way.  Their GAI is in place and you're a single mom with two kids. You'll be getting  a GAI that is way below the poverty line  Your provincial government will hesitate  j  to add much to it because it won't be  getting any money from the federal government for this. You'll have no chance  of getting into co-op or non profit  housing ^"p urograms will be gone  While business would continue to receive  billions in tax exemptions and loopholes,  resentment would build among middle income ^?  working people. Their own wages would fall S£g  due to pressure from a large group of J^F?  people (like the single mom) forced to *i"  work because of low GAI rates. Yet taxes fa  paid by middle income people would sub- a£  sidize employers (with the GAI) to hire f»£  these people at low wages.  As Cy Conick says {Canadian Dimension,  Jan./Feb.   '86),   "It's the old game of  divide and conquer. In effect the regular  wage earner is asked to give up some of  his/her income so that some employers    j&-  needn't pay a living wage." This plan coulcfsae  easily split the poor from middle income  earners who might perceive that low income  people, not an unjust economic system, are  the main cause of their own falling income  In short, this business version of the GAI  is a scheme that lets business appear that  it cares for the poor, but at the same tim<  helps create a system that will, over the  long term, reduce all wages and make more  people poorer, whether they're in the paid  labour force ot not.  •decent jobs at decent wages  •income above the poverty line for people  ?  who can't work  •decent minimum wages  •imported insurance programs (UI, WCB, CPP)-  •maintenance and improvement of universal  =  programs such as education and medicare,  and family allowances  •universal childcare  •a tax system based on ability to pay whichiwuta  redistributes income from the rich to the  poor.  And, with these conditions, we need an in- M  creased earnings exemptions for people re- fil  ceiving welfare or GAI.  Those of us working to end poverty have a  *\ \  big education job ahead of us.

In Canada, the Canadian Council on Social  Development held- an international seminar|  in the late 60's. The seminar's central '  recommendation was a Guaranteed Annual  Income based on merging some existing  income support programs and more funding.  In 1970 the Special Senate Committee on  Poverty formulated a poverty line ».= w  the mid 60's  4  3  mm  While noting that feminist writing \  activity had not as yet focused on this  defence as such, I suggested that it  could be deduced from feminist values  generally, that the human need for shelter, food and clothing is more important  than property interests in themselves.  It was proposed that this should be clear- %  ly reflected in the Criminal Code. The    'j  defence of necessity would then clearly   f  cover interference with the property  rights of others in order to feed, clothe,  or shelter oneself or one's children.  While the reaction to the Report was  mixed, it is certainly true that a common  reaction was outrage, particularly on the  part of the editorial writers of Canada.  I was called, among other things, a  "light-fingered feminist" and the proposal labelled "hare-brained" and "fatuous". The Toronto Sun  declared the  whole report to be a "socialist manifesto all gussied up on bafflegab." The  Report was misread as suggesting that  ---- -~.il a nSe the defence.  wrecked mariners who resort to cannibalism,^  or throw passengers overboard to lighten     \  a sinking lifeboat,  and the more mundane  case of the motorist who exceeds the  speed-limit taking an injured person to  hospital.

He was deciding whether the  defence of necessity was available at all ?  for people charged with criminal offences, j  The case in question was called Perka V.  The Queen,  and had come to the Supreme  Court from the Court of Appeal of British =  Columbia.  The accused had been found on a ship in  Canadian waters with mariju  board.  . They were charged with importing and  possessing narcotics for the purpose of  trafficking. At the trial they gave evidence that they were transporting marijuana from South America to Alaska. They  claimed that weather and difficulties    s  with the ship had made it "necessary" for I  them to enter Canadian waters, where they R  encountered the police.  The Supreme Court of Canada decided that I  the defence of necessity was indeed avail- fc  able to the accused and sent the case back p  to the trial court for a full consideration!  of the issues. ■■^■WHI  [SI  ; to t. - haVe    1 Poverty line  t0 reduce pover-  ^e, Mgher We*_  'using,  ^fS-c^dSfOT  Those  Likewise, you  ..."___^_  credit or family allowance. --a—ii__"  childcare will be drastically cut back  °~*-"'' government will no  fthe federal go1  half of costs.  longer pay  But, because  desperate to feed your     _  the new GAI you can keep what you earn  You scrounge around for a friend or relative to take care of the kids.

However, ^-vug  as poverty continues, it Is legitimate to question the role of the criminal law In controlling people who are not passively  accepting homelessness and hunger.  I was as surprised by the negative reaction as I was warmed by the positive.  Indeed, what was proposed may already  represent the law. At any time,  in Canada cou"M *~-r---  This 1984 decision is important for its  recognition of the defence. Until this  time, it had not been entirely clear that  any such defence existed.  The Supreme Court also provided some guidance on when the defence Is available to  people charged with criminal offences.  Again in the words of Chief Justice Dick-  |  son, the defence "rests on a realistic  I assessment of human weakness, recognizing  that a liberal and humane criminal law  cannot hold people to the strict obedience  of laws in emergency situations where  normal human instincts, whether of self-  preservation or altruism, overwhelmingly  impel disobedience."  Thus a humane criminal law would excuse an  individual who had broken the letter of  the law in an emergency situation, where  there had been no reasonable legal alter- !  native, and where the lesser of two evils .5  had been chosen.  The tests set out by the Supreme Court  reveal the fact that fundamental political |  choices have to be made about the scope of 1  the defence. The very way that we think   ;|  about which is the lesser of two evils  cause concern that the defene<  a ju<^"     P° convict a woman  she did wa  Clasi  |I»»TM  what  PSiT-   ■   —•  peopl  feminists have  defence should  nowhere else to turn  which have  "umen;  'ence of  .

If the law recognises bad weather on the  high seas as an emergency but not poverty,  it then becomes relevant to ask if gender  has anything to do with who is likely to  be a drug smuggler and who is likely to  be poor.  Might courts excuse the mountain-climber  who breaks into an isolated cabin to avoid  freezing to death but not a homeless mother  who squats in an empty office building?  Might drug smugglers have the benefit of  the defence, but not mothers who steal food  for children who are simply hungry but not  on the point of death?  Might police officers who speed to bank  robberies have a defence but not women  heavy and disproportionate burden of poverty. This is in spite of easily available  government statistics. In 1985, Statistics  "Canada issued a.report called Women in  Canada.   It confirms that a much higher  proportion of families headed by women  (45%) fall below the poverty line than  do families headed by men (10$). The  statistics on elderly women cause particular concern. Sixty percent of elderly  unattached women fall below the poverty  line. In 1982, that amounted to 335,000  . Canadian women.  Secondly, I see a strong emphasis on  property rights. They are often valued to  the extent that they may be considered  natural or even god-given, rather than as  simply rights which we have because the  law in our particular time and place says  so.  It is relevant to ask, as one asks just  who is poor in our society, just who  owns the property. A clue can be found  in the statistics on income. Again, Statistics Canada tells us that in 1982,  /*'  o  Might drug smugglers have the  benefit of the defence but not  mothers who steal food for  children who are simply hungry  but not on the point of death?  who have abortions without the permission  of the state?  No doubt feminists will have views on the  appropriate answers to such questions.  However, the media reaction to the Report  is not encouraging of public debate.  I have since asked myself why there was  such a negative reaction. A number of  ideas have occurred to me.  Firstly, I see a stong desire to deny  that poverty and homelessness exist in  Canada. Allied to this is ignorance or  rejection of the fact that women bear a  women earned 52.8% of the amount of income earned by men. The status of property rights is particularly significant  at a time when there is some political  pressure to entrench protection for such  rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.  If men have more money and more women are  poor, and if the law values property  rights over food and shelter rights, it is  not a complex argument that women are  missing the "equal protection and benefit  of the law" as promised in the Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  More important than the constitutional  arguments are the moral ones. Are we  being just as a society if we acknowledge  interests (such as property rights) which  "just happen" to be of disproportionate  benefit to men, and fail to acknowledge  things (such as poverty) which "just  happen" to impose a disproportionate burden on women?  I identified a more complex concern with  the defence of necessity. Some objectors  felt that it acknowledged the situation  of the accused while denying the reality  of the harm to any victim. In other words  someone had to be labelled a criminal to  validate the loss of the victim.  This concern is not unique to necessity,  but is common to all similar defences.  If an accused successfully argues that  he drove the getaway car because a gun  was being held to his head, the bank  has still been robbed. If an accused  person successfully argues that he thought  there was consent, someone has still been  sexually-assaulted. There has never been  a match between the fact of victimization  and a finding of guilt. This is because  the criminal justice system focuses on the  legitimacy of punishment of the accused.  As victims of crimes know from painful experience, the criminal justice system does  not operate to acknowledge their pain.  This is a concern that feminists can surely share. Somehow we need a way of showing  compassion to accused persons, which does  not carry with it a denial of the hurt  and loss of the victim.  Have I learned anything from the fuss  about necessity? I have had a very practical lesson in the importance of active  feminist work in the media-. I also know  that I would like to live in a society  where a report proposing that property  rights have priority over basic survival  rights would be greeted with horror. The  criminal justice system is a relatively  unsophisticated part of our law, but it  does carry some basic messages about  what we value and reject in our society.  gazebo  ail connection  An organization for gay  women sponsoring monthly  dinner/dances and many interest groups  (literary, golf, bridge, etc.).

They are still as talented, warm  and friendly as they were in 1981.  The band I interviewed for Kinesis  (June '81)  consisted of Bonnie Loekhart (piano and  vocals ), Susan Colson ( Bass), Naomi Scha-  piro (flute and sax), and Joan Lefkowitz  (drums). It was their first tour and my  first interview.  Since then,, Joan has left, Danielle Dowers has joined on drums, and first Frieda  Feen, then Inge Hoogerhuis took over lead  vocals. Speaking with Bonnie and Naomi  during the Vancouver Folk Festival in  July, I asked Bonnie how it felt relinquishing her songs to another singer.  1 Bonnie:   It was a hard decision at first,  I but then once I started working with Frieda  I and then Inge it was great. I freed me up  H to concentrate on the piano and do some  1 back-up vocals. So, in the abstract it  1 was difficult but in practice it was fine.  Aside from changes in personnel, the band  has had to deal with a generally worsening economy. Instead of gradually becoming  more self-sufficient as a band, the members have actually found themselves putting  in more hours at other kinds of work in  order to support the music.  if Naomi:  It's become harder and harder. For  i example, many people in the band have jobs  I that make it very difficult to tour now,  j and we used to tour pretty regularly. If  j you don't tour, you can't support yourself  h  in any way as a musician, because people  H get sick of you at home. Actually, we're  g at the point where we're having to figure  out how to change the way we've been doing the work.  We may end up just being an  j   a capella group. v*  We just can't keep up two rehearsals a week, four or five *  gigs a month, and trying to do  a tour that's six or eight  weeks long. We're also getting  older. I just can't go on three <**i»3|  hours of sleep anymore and I  used to be able to do that—work  'til three in the morning, then M  get up at six and go to my nursing job at seven. I just can't  do it. Sf"-"3w3  Bonnie:  The-pleasure of schlepping equipment around late at  night, then getting up and working  in the morning has worn off.  We  may end up just being an a capella  group. It's not nearly so demanding  Five years ago I asked about the role of  children in their lives, and found that '  it was something of a conflict, trying to  be involved with kids and be a musician.  None of them had given birth, though some  were thinking about it. Now, the thinking  has progressed a step further for Naomi.  I Naomi:  I am trying to get pregnant right  .now. I am 36, and I want to have kids  pretty soon, or at least one. It's hard  H to imagine how it will be. I can barely  i keep up the schedule that being a discip-  1 lined, working musician requires now with  1 a paying job, and if I ever want to see my  I floor, and get the dust off it...I don't  H know how it's going to be when I have a  § kid. It's one of the things that's making  | us re-evaluate the way we can work.  Latin American influence has always been  evident in Swingshift's music, both in  the instrumental style and in the choice  of a cappella material. In 1984, the women  took that commitment to Central American  solidarity work several steps further,  with a concert tour of Nicaragua. The  band performed twice a day, in markets,  schools, theatres, hospitals, and military bases, drawing warm responses from  the Nicaraguans, particularly from women.  Despite the work to equalize women's and  men's roles in that country, it is still  a rare sight to see women playing instruments . The topic -of children surfaced again  as we spoke of the tour.  |f Naomi:  Around children, it was really an  i experience, because we were in a society  that adores children. Even though-they  || have no resources, they support children  § and women who have children in a way that  I is diametrically opposed to what happens  If in the United States. The United States is  a country that hates kids and has contempt  1 for new mothers and babies.  I In all the pictures we have of our set-  H ups in Nicaragua, we're surrounded by  !j children. Everywhere there were children—  §f they're just a welcome and normal part of  life. So many times in the States kids  I are hidden away and you don't see them,  and you'know someone's got to be with  them, and those people who are taking care  of the kids are also hidden away and. you  don't see them. People down there would  say to us, "Come move to Nicaragua and  § you can have kids and be musicians too."  lie:  There's the legal support, that  every child is a legitimate child, and  has rights to basic shelter and food,  within the limits of a country at war.  Being a lesbian, being out, and having  a child; who knows what that would be  like. We certainly didn't meet anyone who  could tell us. But there is the feeling  that a woman and child are to be respected  whether there's a man around or not.  I asked them about responses from the  people in Nicaragua to the fact that they're  all lesbians.  I Bonnie:   It was important to us to. come out  H when we<were there, and one of the ways we  || did that was to bring some pictures of the  1 solidarity contigent of the Gay Day march,  I especially 'a percussion group called Sistah  I Boom that I play with. We would say, "Here  i are lesbians and gay men supporting Niear-  I agua, and the gay movement is an important  § part of our solidarity movement."  i It was hard to read what people thought.  f| They certainly didn't act disgusted. They  jj didn't act enormously interested, and ask  j| questions, but then I didn't speak Span-  H ish, so everything was very second-hand  i for me.  f, Naomi:  There are lesbians, in Nicaragua who  1 are in very high positions in government,  I and they are out to everybody. There were  U people who we suspected were gay, and were  1 just not going to come out to us in a  1 group. The attitudes in Nicaragua are more  || open about homosexuality than in some  j other Latin, strongly Catholic countries.  I The attitude in the government is more  H open, and we'll have to see what happens.  i Bonnie:  It was amazing to us how much sup<-  j port the musicians that we met got from  the government, and to me one of the trag-  i" edies of the war is the fact that the MLn-  I istry of Culture had to shut down a lot of  § the People's Cultural Centres, because  j they simply didn't have the resourses to  i keep them open.  %  Naomi:  There's a saying, that everybody in  H Nicaragua is a poet, and they still really  encourage people to write poetry and do  music. People would come up to us over and  j over and say, "We are so glad you brought  1 your music. We really need it. It really  1 heals us." There's a tremendous recogni-  1 tion that death is everywhere, and that  • i music and poetry are good ways to deal  M with death and grief. It was beautiful.  i jf Bonnie:  When we came back to the States it  was important to us to use the inspiration  that we got in Nicaragua. So we made a tour  of 12 towns in rural California that aren't  inundated with solidarity type people, as  San Francisco can seem sometimes. We put  together a slide show and used some of  the music that we had learned, and some |  that we wrote, to hook up with solidarity  movements in those towns, and specifically  to help organizations that were forming.  It was good to see that in all those towns  there was some sort of fledgling movement,  some places a very strong movement.  Such dedication to social change will  surely not be laid to rest, whatever changes these women go through in the forms  of their expression. I'm curious to see  what the next five years will bring to  the women who now form Swingshift.  A cassette recording of Swingshift 'l, .....  is available by writing Swingshift,  2138  McKinley, Apt.

However that is very likely to change when  the rest of the rest of the world finds  about their latest project, the feature  film Loyalties.  Anne Wheeler's professional career began  in 1975—since that time she has been  involved in more than 26 documentaries,  film and television dramas-. She is probably best known for A War Story,   a docu-  drama based oh her father's experiences  as a Japanese prisoner-of-war.  Sharon Riis is one of Canada's most gifted  writers, as at home in film or television  drama as she is in writing novels or short  stories. Her first book was The True Story  of Ida Johnson,  which chronicled the adventures of a "low-rent prairie girl."  Her first feature film script was Latitude  55,  about a woman whose car breaks down in  Northern Alberta during a ferocious winter blizzard.  The Wheeler-Riis collaboration began with '  the award winning television drama Change  of Heart  which centered around the decision of a farm woman to leave her marriage after 30 years. Recently the two  women were in town for the world premiere  of Loyalties,  presented by Women in Focus  and the Vancouver International Film Festival.  Written by Riis and directed by Wheeler,  Loyalties is their second "baby" together. It is a meticulously crafted film  in all respects which reflects not only  their collective expertise and the solidarity of their partnership but also  Sharon Riis and Anne Wheeler  Filmmakers celebrate  their determination to tell stories of  substance which are unique and universal  in their appeal. This desire cannot be  separated from their equally firm determination to live and work in Canada—  •specifically Alberta.  The storyline of Loyalties  and its presentation clearly demonstrates the range  of abilities possessed by Wheeler and Riis.  Within the context of a developing friendship between two women of totally different backgrounds and temperments we are  inexorably drawn into a parallel story of  sexual abuse. However it is the way in  which the plot unfolds and the characters  reveal that surface appearances are deceiving which gives Loyalties  its special  strength.  What emerges is a finely wrought portrait  of the devastation of child abuse and the  courage that the two women find in themselves and each other. Peopled by extraordinary performances, Loyalties stars  Susan Woodridge (from The Jewel and the  Crown fame); Tantoo Cardinal and Kenneth  Welsh (Empire, Perfect  and Heartburn).  Wooldridge plays an upper class English  woman who is forced to move with her husband, an apparently charming doctor, and  their children to the remote community  of Lac La Biehe in northern Alberta.  Welsh is cast as her husband with a terrible secret and Tantoo Cardinal is the extraordinary Metis woman, Rosanne, who  eventually befriends very lonely and uptight Lily Sutton.  Most extraordinary of all is the performance given by Diane Debassige who plays  Leona, the adolescent daughter of Rosanne  and the object of the doctor's lust.  Some of Loyalties most chilling - moments  are contained in.the way in which the  Welsh's character uses the young girl's  awe and trust of him against her. Like  Leona (Debassige) we can hardly beleive  what is happening until it is too late.  I met with Anne Wheeler and Sharon Riis  to discuss the film, the peculiarites of  the' Canadian feature film industry and  their unique working relationship.  Kinesis: How did you two meet?  ■ Wheeler:  I had heard about Sharon and I  was looking for a writer to work with on  Change of Heart  so I just phoned her up.  We had a little chat...  Riis:  It sounded like a good idea and we  met and we liked each other. We're different but we have a similar way of looking  ' at things. Change of Heart  went so well  ordinary lives  that afterwards Anne said she felt ready  to do a feature and did I want to write  it, and I said sure.  Wheeler:  I loved the characters of Latitude  55  and I had read Ida Johnson  and I  thought it was incredible that this person  was living in Alberta (where Wheeler also  makes her home)—you know, 'out-back  there' (laughs)  Kinesis:  What is the focus of your stories?  What are you both interested in writing?  Riis:  There's a general theme that runs  through lots of my work and that is that  people aren't what they seem on the surface. From Loyalties  for instance you have  the character of Roseanne's husband who  seems at first very unsympathetic and yet  later we find he has better qualities than  the doctor who is supposed to be so charming and likeable. Of course, I'm interested  in writing about women and the things we  all have to deal with. You know there aren't  many feminists in Lac La Biche (where Riis  lives) but we all have kids and we all  have to clean out the toilet so there are  things we all can identify with. When we  talk on a one to one basis, we have the  same concerns, sometimes it's just in how  you put it. I also like to write things  about people who are really ordinary but  who do extraordinary things.  You know there aren't many  feminists in Lac La Biche but  we all have kids and we all  have to clean out the toilet  so there are things we all  can identify with.  Kinesis: Anne,  is there a pattern which repeats itself in the film you direct?  Wheeler:  Well, it's not dissimilar from  Sharon which is probably why we work well  together. I like to show that people...  who outwardly may look very different,  inwardly share basic things which are the  same. If you dig deep there are certain  values which are common among us. Loyalties  for instance is the story of two  women who went through a process to discover that there were things about themselves that were very much the same. ■  Kinesis: The director's job is to translate the writer 's work to the screen and  often it seems that collaborations don't  work out.  Wheeler:  I think it is more often that  the writer is disgusted with what has  happened to their material, there have  been a lot of lawsuits to prove that.  There are often so many ego struggles.  But I am very collaborative. If you have  the best interests of the film at heart  you put your ego aside and stay open.  Riis:  We'd talk loosely about the general  story (of Loyalties);  about the two women  from different cultures and then I'd go  off and write the first draft and then  Anne would read it and then we'd talk and  talk and even act out certain scenes.  Writer Sharon Riis and director Anne Wheeler  Kinesis: It sounds like the script was  changing all the time,   even during shooting—how did you work that out? Were there  any surprises?  Wheeler:   I was making changes—even on set  I had to change dialogue to make it work.  Now, there aren't very many writers and  directors that can do this together.  Riis:  Because we worked so closely on the  script, it was the same film we had in  our brain (laughs).  Wheeler:   I'm not all paranoid that she's  going to dislike it.  Riis:  And I know that she's not going to  all of a sudden have the actors talking  about Jean Paul Sartre or something. After  working together all this time I trust her  absolutely. I see the finished film and  it's the same film I had in mind from the  beginning.  Kinesis: Sharon, did you have difficulty  making that transition from writing novels or short stories to writing for the  screen?  Riis:  No, I just kind of slipped into it.  You know how some people can crochet  really well, they're good with their hands,  they have a knack for it. It's the same  for me—I have a knack for it, partly because I like the collaborative process.  Right now I'm writing a novel but I'll  be sure to go back to film—I like the  socialness of it. And it's really exciting to see a lot of people doing their  jobs so carefully.  Kinesis: Anne, tell me a bit about the  casting of the film. It must have been  difficult for you to find an actor who  would play the part of the doctor.  Wheeler:   I really had to think when I was  casting about who was willing to take  risks because Loyalties was a very risky  film for an actor to make. Some good  Canadian actors wouldn't even audition  for the part of the doctor. They said "No,  it will ruin my career, 'I want to be a  hero." I actually didn't audition Ken. I  sent the script to him and then flew to  Toronto. We had dinner and I was very  straightforward about what I wanted. It's  a hard part for a man, there isn't a lot  of sympathy for him, or an explanation of  why he is the way he is.  Riis:  The film is about women, I didn't  want to focus on him. It is not about  rape.  Wheeler:  There was also a lot of pressure  to cast very beautiful., American-type  (television) series women, which we obviously didn't want. I had a very good  relationship with the casting director  who is a very strong woman and was very  supportive of my choices. The hardest part  was casting the role of Leone (Roseanne's  daughter). I was very concerned about the  effect on a child of doing that scene  (where she is attacked by the doctor).  Kinesis: Sharon,  why do you think you've  managed quite well at the business of  writing for film where a lot of other  people have not been as successful?  Riis:  I think a lot of people who write  for film do a lot of other things. Maybe  they do other writing and they take,that  quite seriously. But when they write for  film, they think: "Oh great, I'm gonna  make a bunch of money and it'll be a piece  of cake. All I have to do is write this  outline." I-think it fails there because  just like writing anything, any piece of  good prose, to write a film you have to go  right into it. From yourself, you have to  get into the characters and really sweat  over it.  I'll only do one thing at a time. I meet  film writers who are working on three  or four other projects and- I don't see how  ■ they can do it. I want to write stories  and I want to write film that I don't see.  I see so much shit, it's unbelievable.  Ideas are a dime a dozen; it's how you do  it that counts.  Wheeler:  The whole policy in Canada really  encourages producers to have twenty things  going at once. (Producers hire the writer  and then much later a director is hired  usually after the script is written).  Wheeler:  Like Sharon, I can only do one  thing at a time if I'm gonna do it well...  it's interesting that some of the better  films coming out of Canada are being made  by filmmakers who only do one thing at a  time and who do things very carefully.  Loyalties received a standing ovation from  the packed opening night audience at the  Ridge Theatre. It will be released theatrically after it has been screened at Toronto 's Festival of Festivals this month  (September).  18   Kinesis September TO  September TO Kinesis   19 ^ssssmasaas^^  ARTS  by Wendy Frost  Over the last decade and a half, women's  work and work for women have emerged as  key.feminist concerns. Many periodicals  have been established which focus not  only on feminist organizing within specific occupations but on the broader issues related to women's position in  the work force. This month, we're reviewing a selection of journals and newsletters produced- by and for women working  in particular fields. Next column we'll  concentrate on several which offer a  more general perspective.  Blue Collar Workers:  Tradeswoman  is a lively and attractively  laid out magazine for women in blue  collar work. It is published quarterly  by Tradeswoman, Inc.—a non-profit activist organization which supports and promotes women working in non-traditional  jobs. Tradeswoman, Inc. was formed in  1979 to provide blue collar women with  peer support, resource referral, a networking system and advocacy. It is San  Francisco based and has members across  North America. In 1983, the organization  sponsored the first across US conference  of women in the trades, attended by 600  women from a wi4e variety of blue collar  occupations.  The magazine features interviews with  women in various trades, health and  safety information, articles on trade  union rights and organizing issues, as  well as poetry and fiction by and about  working women. The range of specific topics is suggested by a list of titles  from back issues: A Working Mother, Reproductive Hazards, Racism on the Job,  A Telephone Repairwoman,   The Machinist  Trade,  Affirmative Action,  Our Future  Under Reagan, A Sheetmetal Woman, Asbestos Issues.  A favourite piece of ours is from- the ~  spring, 1986 issue—an imaginary turn-  the-tables job interview in which "a man  is applying to be a firefighter, in a  society where fire departments have always been all-female, and where the concept that men can be firefighters is regarded with either suspicion or amusement."  Membership in Tradeswoman, Inc. is US$40  per year, employed and US$25, un-employed.  This fee includes subscriptions to both  the quarterly magazine and to the monthly newsletter, Trade Trax,   a guide to  resources, job information and support  groups, largely in the San Francisco  area. Write to: PO Box 40664, San Francisco, CA 94H0.  Educational Workers:  An excellent newsletter which we recently  discovered right under our noses is the  BC Teachers' Federation Status of.  Women  Newsletter.  The journal is published quarterly and is available to non-members as  well as members of the BCTF free of charge.  Status of Women Newsletter  is primarily  concerned with teaching practices and ed   ucation policies and will be of interest  not only to a range of educational workers but to any women parenting children  in the public school system.  Issues are thematically organized; recent  topics include: An End to Poverty for  Women,  Control of Bodies,   and Non-Sexist  Teaching.  The articles are generally  short, contributed by BCTF members and  frequently based on their own classroom  experiences. Articles in the copies we  saw were wide ranging: the UN Forum in  Nairobi, sex education, VDTs, young women  and technology, sexism and mythology. Information book reviews and comprehensive  lists of resource materials—films, videos,  teaching kits—round out each issue.  Our general impression is that the newsletter effectively draws together working  and learning conditions. The editors encourage readers to reprint articles they  find useful, asking only that the newsletter be creditied. To be put on the  mailing list, write: Status of Women Newsletter,   BCTF, 2235 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC V6J 3H9.  Midwives:  The Practicing Midwife  is edited by Ina  May Gaskin, director of the Farm Midwifery  Center in Summertown, Tennessee. With the  summer 1986 issue, the journal will be  retitled The Birth Gazette.  The publication is directed at midwives, childbirth  educators, nurses, physicians, parents  and public health workers. Its focus is on  information sharing and skill development  for midwives—Delivering Placentas,  Prevention of Hemmorhage,  Eating and Drinking  During Labour,  Prevention of Episiotomies,  What to Say to a Mother during Labour—  as well as the broader political issues  central to the birthing movement—The  Mechanization of Birth,  Abandoned Babies  in the US,  Certification of Midwives,  Emergency Medical Support for Home  Births.  The Birth Gazette  will take up similar  issues, but plans to be wider in scope:  international reports, legal and .ethical  issues surrounding childbirth, regular  advice columns, practical tips for parents, conference coverage, historical  articles, book, video and 'film reviews.  The magazine emphasizes "strategies for  innovation, both personal and professional," and is a good source of information  on the range of issues involved in changing care surrounding childbirth. We found  the reports on the work of activists in  the field particularly interesting, and  useful to both workers and laypersons. Case  studies and photoessays help make technical  concerns accessible.  The Birth Gazette is quarterly, and is  available for US$23 per year from: 42,  The Farm, Summertown, TN 38483.  Sex Workers:  Network: News from the English Collective  of Prostitutes  is the "first paper of its  kind written by prostitute women for each  other and the public."'The motto on the  cover is "No Bad Women/Just Bad Laws", a  clear political stance which sets the  tone for the entire publication. Small but  weighty, each four-page issue is packed  with coverage of activism and organizing  for rights of workers on all levels of the  sex industry.  The international coverage is superb and  clear links are drawn not only between  women in different countries but between  various struggles: for example the peace  movement {Whores Against Wars),   anti-  racist organizing and anti-poverty work.  In the three issues we received, there  were at least two references to the work  of Vancouver's ASP (The Alliance for the  Safety of Prostitutes), and a photo of  ECP picketing the Canadian Embassy in  London in support of ASP's July 1984  occupation of Christ Church Cathedral.  As well as news items, The Network  features powerful first-person pieces on  problems facing prostitute women: working  conditions, police harassment, violence,  losing children to the state.  La 1975, the English Collective of Prostitutes formally became part of the Wages  for Housework Campaign; the newsletter  frequently addresses the connection between women's unpaid labour and prostitution. The collective would appreciate  financial contributions, however large -  or small, to their campaign* for the abolition of all laws against prostitutes.  Goals of the campaign include: "justice  against illegal arrests and police harassment", "the right to work and live with  other women", "financial help and housing for women who want to get off the  game or run away from a pimp", and "the  increase of all social security benefits  and women's wages, and payment for housework, so that no women is forced into  prostitution by lack of money."  At this point The Network  is published  irregularly. Our most recent information  on prices is US$3 for three issues.

I set out to try to find some information on Dub Poetry before writing the  reviews below and to my surprise I  could find nothing. I hope that this  can be attributed to my insufficient  research skills and not to racism in  North American arts journalism, but I  am not so sure.  As far as I can gather from the introductions of the following books, and  what little I already knew, Dub Poetry  is a uniquely Jamaican phenomena which  has been brought to North America by  immigrants. It generally has a political bent and often has a Rastafarian  element.  Breaking Chains by Afau.  Sistervision  (Toronto:  1984),   48 pages.      f||||||  In her preface, Afua writes that "It  is nothing new to say that the world  is full of gross inconsistencies, thus  poetry is for me a vehicle that I can  use to open eyes, ears, and help unglue  lips; also to touch  emotions.  She is not always entirely successful  in this. The collection is uneven—  sometimes yielding strong, rhythmic  poems and too often Weak|pi|ff6crussed  poems.  Afua's. rythmic raps are her real  strength. Repetition and loose rhyme  emphasize the message. Simple words  translate too deeply felt images.  Out of silence  I shape words  out of silence  I make words  out of silence  I create  words  sounds psiilili  and  rhythm  ' Words in Action  These stronger poems reflect the oral  traditions of Afua's Jamaican and  African ancestors. They read as if they  were meant to be chanted. They have an  internal drumbeat, a richness of voice.  Her weaker poems, like "Love in Reverse"  and "Mother's Reflection", have a loose,  flowing, prosey style. They read like  journal or diary entries but with no  particularly stimulating language, no  moments of insight, no poignancy.  I was sorry that she had chosen to include these less successful poems among  the more powerful ones. Some of them,  admittedly, contain rhythmic bits that  hint of her other style, but on the •  whole they make the collection less  crisp, less effective.  South Afrika  is one of the best poems  in the book and utilizes Afua's skills'  to good advantage. She speaks her native  Jamaican dialect in the poem which adds  rhythm, colour and richness.  We haffi chant down South Afrika  and death! to Apartheid  and it 's vampiahs  <•' Batustan  • howdem tief our Ian  we must use our voices  to chant down oppression  'use our voices to spread  the message of liberation  giving fire to revolution!  If you want to experience this book, I  would suggest doing it out loud. Once  you get into the beat, the 48 pages fly  by. I found myself wishing that I was  listening to- the poet instead of reading  her in print.  Speshal Rikwes by Ahdri Shina Mandiela.  Sistervision (Toronto: 1985),   57 pages.  Mandiela tells us in her introduction not  to "just read Speshal Rikwes;  play it  with your own voice and hear the music!"  As the book progresses, this becomes as"  much a necessity as a choice.  The first of three chapters includes poems  which are "recognizable as English" but  which "slowly tune the ears to a sounds  style". The second immerses us in Jamaican  dialect "designed to produce total familiarity with the language and rhythmic  style", though still interspersed with  some "cross-over" poems—largely English  with Jamaican terms and idioms throughout. In the third chapter, the transition  is complete and the poems must, for the  non-Jamaican reader, be read aloud to be  understood.  This is a well-thought-out book and an  excellent print introduction to Dub'Poetry,  a style obviously meant to be oral. There  is a brief explanation in the introduction  of the "linguistic styling" used. For  example, all h's before vowels are silent  as in (h)ave, (h)ear and a glossary of  Jamaican phrases and words can be found at  the back.  Even with these aids, I found the last  chapter difficult to feel totally immersed  in. I was working too hard at understanding what I was reading. For this reason,  I savoured the English poems because I  could wholly appreciate the skill and meaning in them.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy chanting the  Jamaican—the sounds, the rhythm, the  quite different world view—and when I let  myself go into the language, I found I  understood a good deal more of its meaning.  Night Children,  an English poem from the  first chapter, employs a free-floating  rhyming pattern unlike the rhythmically  steady rhyming more common in the Jamaican  poems. Its metaphors have an almost Latin  quality, reminding me of South American  poetry, full with the colours, shapes and  scents of the natural world and how they  are reflected in human emotion:  Awakened  tree trunk  writhing  through  the windless night air  aching to erupt  its bulbous root  from a drought-drenched  earth  Two very short poems in this chapter  show Mandiela's skill in compressing  thought into succinct language. I liked  I am best.  i/used to be  a lot of things  now/i am  more  but Sheep Story  is also a delight.  As Mandiela progresses into Jamaican,  the poems take on a distinctly more  political flavour, addressing issues  like apartheid, racism in Jamaica, US  intervention in Central America and  the Caribbean, and feminism. In her  book Afua says that she cannot separate  her femaleness from her blackness. Mandiela, too, takes a serious view of the  importance of woman's struggle within  the black struggle. From Ooman Gittup  (Woman Get Up):  Ooman gittup  outah dih bed  and from ovah dih stove  now  eekwal pay an birt kantrol  wih elp you mek it  sum ow  This is the more intelligent of these  two books, full of passion and life and.  including lessons in Jamaican politics  and the complexities, of Dub Poetry.

It is  too long since I have encountered a  poet who is able, through a fortunate  marriage of circumstances and temper-  ment, to portray motherhood in a warm  and largely joyful light. Partnerships,  friendships, depressions, birthing,  the essence of summer—all are given  the same playful, probing approach.  Her ability to give an ordinary (extraordinary) moment the necessary  combination of energy and tenderness  is further shown in Remembering  as  she describes her feelings just  after the birth of her first child:  It was nothing so much as falling.  In love. In snow. It wasn't at all  ■like ibhe eternity which had passed  through my womb, cramped and bitter  and crying for space.  Her playfulness is given full rein in  a Dennis Lee kind of lullaby for this  daughter:  ...0 my little Bean  go lightly into this lightening  dream,  sway nightly in my arms like  a subtle green willow bough born in  the early spring of year one,  0 you're  sleeping now with drooping chin.  Occasionally, as in Three Sins,  Young  wanders into the obscure; her images  become sufficiently dense or personal  as to make it difficult for (the reader) to decipher her message. I couldn't  frankly tell you exactly what this  poem is about. Occasionally also, her  habit of grabbing a central metaphor  by the neck, and playing with it like  a cat for an entire poem, can pall.

Though  it contains some tasty bits of language,  and it is quite easy to tell what this  poem is about, in the end it says very  little that is of any great importance.  Other poems using this same technique,  however, work very well. Summer Dreamed  is a delightful, feelable expression of  how summer makes itself felt in a  person's spirit. It ends with:  Then suddenly,  rocking on the porch  and listening to frogs  play the night like a piccolo,  I would dream myself so close to summer  I could taste the honey of her  on my tongue.  This poem is an example of Young's  skill of encapsulating a feeling, a  person, a moment. The poem Melancholy  is a detailed portrait of a feeling  made incarnate. Melancholy is female- I  seductive, destructive, passive-aggressive—an embodiment of those conditioned traits that feminism does daily  battle with:  ' Why do I allow her to stay  when her huge blank eyes interfere  with my domestic affairs?  Why,  when she can entice me  to a tiger 's death with the flick  of her ash,   toss of her hair?  Young does battle in her own way with  these female stereotypes by exposing  them, as simply and directly as above.  Though the poems in this collection  as a whole are somewhat inconsistent in  quality, nearly always clever, sometimes brilliant, sometimes dense and  obscure, there is generally a feeling  of the illumination of a life that  could be yours, mine or the woman's  next door. Young does not condescend  to her common (and sometimes uncommon)  subject matter but instead helps us to  see the rare beauty in it.

Markham,  Ontario: Penguin Books,   1986.  This book is dedicated "to those who died  for the South Africa struggling to be born"  and it is a testament to Benson's style that  this struggle is articulated with the clarity and immediacy of a well-edited documentary. Benson takes us through Nelson Mandela1  childhood to his imprisonment, in straightforward language and with excerpts from  Mandela's own writing.  The book is rich with photographs and one  shows Winnie Mandela with her two daughters—Zeni and Zindzi—on their way to  visit Mandela in Pollsmoor prison in 1985.  It is a beautifully sensual photograph of  the three women who are continuing Mandela's  political work while he slowly and inevitably  ages in confinement.  The history and goals of the African National Congress are outlined and explained in  terms of its resistance to the white suprem-  ist government which controls South Africa.  The specific and systematic racism of the  ruling minority is presented in economic  terms and at his trial Mandela explained  that "the most important political document  ever adopted by the ANC is the Freedom Charter. It is by no means a blueprint for a  socialist state. It calls for redistribution, but not nationalization of land; it  provides for nationalization of mines,  banks and monopoly industry, because big  monopolies are owned by one race only,  and without such nationalization racial  domination would be perpetuated despite  the spread of political power."  The two major impressions this work left  with me are the juxtaposition between the  basic justice black South Africans are  fighting for, and the Afrikaners' determined nationalism which precludes such justice, and the persistent revolutionary  spirit of activists like Mandela.  Black children are being shot, in the back,  thousands of people are tortured, detained  indefinately and subject to daily intimidation and humiliation. And the spirit is  not broken. In 1979 Winnie Mandela wrote  to a friend that she has "no doubt how  sacrosanct our cause is and how near we  are to our goal in terms of historical  periods." Nelson Mandela: The Man and  the Movement  dramatizes the public and private elements of a life-long commitment  to freedom and is an inspiring account of  a political legend.  Josephine Herbst:  The Story She Could Not  Tell,   By Elinor Langer,   436 pages.  New  York:  Warner Books,   1983.  If you have ever read surveys of the literature of the thirties,.chances are that  you have seen the name of Josephine Herbst.  She was a radical journalist and novelist,  who as a reporter, covered the most significant political events of her time. She  was a feminist, had sexual liaisons with  women and was written out of the patriarchal literary establishment.  When Elinor Langer finally learned of  Herbst'a- work she wondered why it had  taken so long and set about to make' sure  that Herbst's work and ideas came to the  attention of a new generation of readers.  The resulting biography is an important  account of. a woman struggling with her art.  and economic survival, marred only by  Langer's discomfort with Herbst's lesbian  experience.  Langer writes about Herbst that "as a radical  it had been her ambition to understand  people in relation to the social forces that  affected them." Her most famous novels form  a trilogy and detail American life from the  reconstruction to the outbreak of the second  world war.  Pity Is Not Enough,   The Executioner Waits  'and Ropes Of Gold have all been reprinted  by Warner Books and each has an introduction  by Elinor Langer. The centrality of her  women characters distinguish Herbst from  her contemporary and like-minded colleagues  such as James Farrell {Studs Lonigan)  and  sJohn Dos Passos (USA).  Elinor Langer's work is to be lauded by  feminists concerned with how easily our  creative heritage is buried. I must say, however, that as much as I devoured the information in this well-written account of a serious  writer struggling for economic survival, I  await a biography of Elinor Herbst which is  lesbian positive. Langer's linguistic gymnastics in explaining Herbst's passionate affair  with artist Marion Greenwood disturbed and  angered me. I finished the book wondering  what had been left out of this important  biography.  Plaintext,  by Nancy Mairs,  154 pages.  Tucson: University of Arizona Press,  1986.  If you want to begin the autumn with a  book which will 1.) inspire you in your -  work over the cool winter months. 2) have  you rushing to the nearest photocopy machine "  with envelopes addressed to your pre-femin-  ist mother and super-macho brother and 3)  have you cheering in the aisles over the sheer  gutsiness of women, read thes'e|. essays.  Not only does Nancy Mairs write well, she has  "a talent of interweaving the most daily of  life's quirks with a serious questioning  about women's oppression. Her subject matters  range from foster mothering to electroshock  therapy but her underlying consistent concern  involves her struggles to be well and her coming to terms with being a woman in a fiercely  patriarchal society.  Each reader will choose her favorite essay in  'a collection of excellent work. I found the  one entitled On Keeping Women In/Out  to be  particularly poignant in its discussion of  agoraphobia and its relationship to our deeply embedded cultural belief that the public  domain is a male place. It helped me to understand the complexity of my relationship to  writing as a public act frought with psychic  danger despite the political context in  which I work.  Mairs writes that "the doom of centuries  has rendered those two words—woman  and  artist—antinomic (contradictory); and  those women who have resisted the enforce-,  ment of silence that would stifle their  creations have done so often at staggering  expense." Mairs' humour is helping her to  survive agoraphobia, depression and multiple  sclerosis and it gives her .writing a unique  brillance and vibrancy. Put Plaintext  at  the top of your must read list for sure.  The Heart of the Race: Black Women 's Lives  in Britain,  by Beverley Bryan,  Stella  Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe.  Virago Press,   1985.  This book, which was reviewed in this column in February 1986, has won the Martin  Luther-King Memorial Prize for 1985. The  award is given every April 4th, the anniversary of his death, for a literary work  which reflects his ideals. In my February  review I said "goodbye to the dryness and  tedium of mainstream history texts: The  Heart of the Race  is as moving and engaging as the best of fiction should be."

Pension credits  and divorce  Re: Sharing the Canada Pension Credits  (if your marriage has ended)  Following my divorce in 1984, I applied  to Income Security Programs, Ottawa, for  my share in the equal division of pension  credits, but was rejected due to a clause  in my separation agreement which stated:  "...the wife agrees that she shall not  make any further claim against the husband ."  I am appealing this decision and would  be.interested to hear from other women  who have had a similar experience.  A pamphlet published in 1983'by Health  and Welfare Canada entitled, "Sharing  the Canada Pension Credits" very clearly  states:  Separation agreements or judicial division of assets do not affect your rights  to this division.  However, my application was rejected  because of the above clause in my separation agreement.  The government pamphlet was revised a  year later and the above statement was  deleted. However, in this recent pamphlet, it has still not been made clear  to the public that division of Canada  Pension Credits between a divorced couple  will be disallowed if such a clause as  mine is inserted. (And virtually all  separation agreements contain that clause),  Evidently, it must be worded very clearly  in your agreement that you wish to share  in the pension credits.

I  feel that it is a direct result of this  social criticism and pressure that changes  in the grossly archaic and tortuous treatment of homosexuals and mental patients  in general, have taken place.  It is a beneficial thing to support and  recognize positive changes in psychiatric ■  institutions. But it is important to  remember that these changes (wherever they  exist), did not come so long ago, or so  easily. Nor were they changes made very  willingly by most who had the power to do  so.  It wasn't very long ago that people were  •lobotomized for being gay. And it is a  very, recent development that the unchecked  and rampant abuse of electric and chemical  - shock treatments for- all varieties of  "mental illnesses", have been somewhat  curbed. The fact that you had some power to  decide  what worked for you, and that you  weren't forced to deny your reality of  being a lesbian; these things have helped  make your experience a safer and more positive one. People are not safe when they  have no power. And power has never been  given up without a fight. So whether we  freely choose straight alternatives, or  whether we must  use them, it is important  to remember that they are only safer because people's hard work made  them that  way. And the struggle is far from being  over.  Thanks, Sorres  Transition House  debate continues  Kinesis:  I am writing this letter in response to the  article titled. Not All Are Homophobic, by  Elf St'ainsby, in Kinesis May '86. ■  First of all thanks Elf for being so open  about your experiences. I know how difficult that can be and I respect and admire  you doing so for our beneift.  I am glad you wrote the letter and pointed  out the fact that 'straight' psychiatric  alternatives can sometimes be safe, because  I think we need to stop and recognize that.  But I think it is essential to remember  and maintain our criticisms of the 'straight  scene as well.  I know that your lesbianism was accepted,  but this definitely would not have been  the case if psychiatrists had never had   24   Kinesis September TJ6  Re: Response To Transition House Society  Letter  The ongoing debate concerning feminist services and government involvement appears to  be a long lasting and sometimes bitter struggle. I want to respond to the latest in a  series of letters regarding services provided  by women's groups in the lower mainland.  I have questions addressed to jthe Society as  a whole, but initially would state that I  disagree with Ms. Gallagher's opening comments.  At no point did I sense any level of "trashing  of...women working in transition houses" in  Bonnie Agnew's letter in Kinesis,  May '86.  While I respect Ms. Gallagher's right to her  personal opinions, I do not agree with comments of that nature. If there is a specific  criticism it should be defined and addressed.  Recognizing that government funding (as per  diem rates) means "accepting some conditions"  • is truly-an understatement. How can the  Society and its members determine what conditions are acceptable when operating from a  powerless position?  I object strenuously to the comment •"...hope  to, through dialogue and a willingness to be  accountable, further increase better services  to battered women." Just who is to be held  accountable by whom? Is the Society in such  a powerful position that it can hope to hold  MHR and its minister accountable? Can the  Society expect MHR to accept feminist groups  as having an equal status in decision-making  and fiscal planning?  With regards to negotiations,. what power  does the Society have that would be acknowledged by MHR and would provide equal status  for initiating plausible negotiations?  And please don't patronize me with statements about the "further increase of better  services for battered women." The Socred's  actions speak much louder than their many,  many words!  I believe it. would be constructive for the  Society to further question itself with  regards to women ineligible for welfare and  their ability to use transition houses.  This is yet another crucial area not to be  ignored.  What is available for women, who for any  of a number of reasons, do not want the  state to know of or have control of them?  These women, as a matter of safety, are ineligible for welfare.  From personal experience, what of the woman  who absconds with her children, seeking a  safe place for protection from the ex-  partner and the state"!  The Society and it's  members may mean well and want to welcome  her but the conditions of reporting and  lack of confidentiality necessary to  receive per diem rates have now made  those transition houses unsafe for her,  therefore unavailable. Conditions accepted  or imposed by various elements of government co-optation directly affect the operating standards of. any service provided  by any group.  The issue of volunteer and paid labour,  especially within feminist circles, is  both long lived and many faceted. A paycheck does not automatically empower a  woman for her labour. It can also serve  as an example of the disparities of class,  bring forth questions of paid professionalism vs. experienced, though unpaid,  volunteers and- a litany of other issues.  Finally I question the necessity of the  last comment, feeling that it detracts  from the original aims of the letter.  When attempting to question another's  objectives, clear thinking is more productive than venting.  In sisterhood,  Stephanie Smart  Smithers, B.C.  IWD needs  women for 1987  Women of Vancouver:  I am writing on behalf of the Vancouver  International Women's Day Committee to  ask for your help in 1987.  I do not know who is planning to be on  the Committee next year. Without involvement from women in Vancouver, there will  not be an IWD parade and rally next year.  For those who want to get involved but  don't know what to do, there is a handbook and resource file available, as well  as contact lists.  For those who want to get involved but  don't know how, please contact Onni Milne  at 324-5467. There will be a meeting  around the middle of September to bring  everyone together.  If no one volunteers, there will be no  IWD parade and rally in 1987.  I will be putting together IWD displays  at the Vancouver Public Library (main  branch) and Carnegie Centre Art Gallery.  These will be up for two weeks—March 1  to March 15.  If it happens as planned, I will be working with Cable 10, North Shore, to put  together a half hour documentary about  International Women's Day.  Onni Milne Letters  ^mm-msm-mz^z^  Incest film has  to he mainstream  Kinesis:  On behalf of Women in Focus, I would like  to thank everyone who came to our premiere  of Breaking Silence  on June 2. I was  pleased to see the thought-provoking review by Kim Irving that followed in  Kinesis.  There is, however, one comment that I  would like to address. Ms. Irving claims  that Breaking Silence  "fails with (Tollini's  decision to interview rapists, and in particular,- the sympathetic view toward these  men." Yes, the film includes footage of a  man who had sexually assaulted his daughter over three years, and what he did  (whether or not he apologised to her  later) has no excuse.  He—the sole offender in the film—is presented to drive home the point that abused  children become abusers.  I do not see any sympathy shown to him or  to any of the fathers or other offenders  of the incest survivors in the film. What  Tollini does suggest is the effects of.  the cycle of abuse and our socialization,  which often cause women to take their  pain out on themselves and men to take  it out on others.  She makes a special effort to show the  abuse of power in that cycle, and how a  boy will follow his assigned role to regain his sense of "manhood" by hurting  someone who he perceives as "weaker".  As Tollini said, many women want to know  why men rape. Most of the women interviewed in Breaking Silence  have personally  confronted their offenders, but that  doesn't entirely answer the question for  them or for other women.  I don't believe that one has to choose  between "feminist" and "mainstream". A  film such as Breaking Silence,  which is  being presented to as large a cross-section  of the' population as possible, has to be  "mainstream" to be of value to all the  people who see it. This in no way undermines its feminist basis and strong condemnation of incest and child sexual abuse.  This was the spirit in which the premiere  was arranged. It. was intended as a showcase for the film and discussion of the  issue. And the issue and the message of the  film is that little girls and little boys  both are victims of incest, "children who  .must struggle to grow up," that incest is  an abuse of power and trust, and that it  has to stop.  Sandra J. Benson  Distribution Assistant, Women in Focus  The voice  of Chaleen  Kinesis:  In May of 1986, you mentioned a story in  which I was in. I am Rebecca you described  in the East End housing problems—eg. Expo  evictions. I am submitting an article  about myself and government and how it  has affected me, but I am putting it in  the third person, because people don't  want to hear about your problems.  I am the voice of many oppressed women.  My name is Chaleen. When Chaleen was  twelve, she had a nervous breakdown. It  was the price to pay for her parent's  constant squabbling and subsequent divorce. She can still hear her parent's  say: "our problems had nothing to do  with you."  Chaleen got better for a while until her  mother became mad and then Chaleen left  and got a job during the summer when  she was sixteen and worked for $2.15 an  ,  hour, supporting herself. In the fall,  she went back to school until she graduated, which she somehow, remarkably,  did. By this time she was nineteen and  jobs were hard to come by. They paid  just under $4.00 and Chaleen didn't  like the way her bosses, most of them,  expected her to sleep with them.  Back on welfare, just like before,  Chaleen was starving and lost 20 pounds,  in one week from not eating. This went on  for years until Chaleen took to the  streets to feed herself. No family, no  love, and no love-lost for those, she  survived with a vengeance and a hatred;  that has kept her going to this day.  Chaleen walked into many hospital rooms  complaining of abdominal pain and recurring pelvic pain. "Give her some  tranquillizers." A year later she was in  the hospital having her gall bladder  removed and subsequent gallstones. "Oh,  it's been there for years," the doctor  kept saying, "why didn't anyone check  it out?" Chaleen just turned to stone  and wept. Chaleen went back to the hospital room. "Just give her some tranquillizers." Two years later she was in  the hospital again. "You were right, all  along." Recovering from a hysterectomy  due to extensive endometrosis, Chaleen  turned to stone ;and wept.  The point of this story is that the government would rather spend money to get  someone operated on, which could have  been prevented in the first place if  they had given her enough to live on  during those turbulent years. The  government—they will take your life,  your kids, and everything you got, if  they could. Chaleen has taken to writing  out of sheer bitterness. One day she  hopes to be happy at last.  Minority women  in the movement  Re: Symposium. Cultural Barriers: Myths  and Realities. The Role of Minority Women  in the Women's Movement.  May 10th, 1986 was a historic day for  women. A symposium was held at Camosun  College, Victoria, BC, bringing women of  many cultures and racial backgrounds  together with women of the women's movement. Developed by Mahinder Doman and  sponsored by the Victoria Status of Women  Action Group, this event was supported  and endorsed by many women's groups and  individuals.  Hailed as a first-ever, it has received  favourable national and provincial attention. How-to inquiries have been received  from women in other areas wishing to sponsor similar events. Opening the symposium  with a meditation blessing (so common to  many Asian cultures embarking upon new  adventures) was Mrs. Dhana Moodley who  came some fifteen years ago from South  Africa. Many favourable comments were  overheard about her energies.  The morning panel briefly examined and  discussed the history of minority women,  their presence in the women's movement  and also, in Women's Studies. One of the  panelists commented that 'feminists' must  fight all forms of oppression, including  racism.  The resource women increased in number by  one during lunch. Marie-Therese Danielsson,  a journalist from French Polynesia who  was in Victoria for the Islands '86 Conference, spoke informally to many women.  Asian women, a Native woman and a Black  woman comprised the afternoon panel. They  offered "from the heart" insights about  their role as women in their respective  cultures. Additionally they proferred  thoughts as to why so few women of  'minority' status are involved with the  feminist or women's movement.  The subject of racism seemed to emerge as  a theme. Ruth Harding of Vancouver,  delivered a stirring and eloquent presentation. She reflected that as a black  woman, her primary concern is. not to compete with or confront black men about  the subject of 'equality'. But rather,  'equality' as a citizen of Canada regardless of skin shade must come first; not  only for women but children and men of  her background (and other 'minority'  groups) should experience the positiveness  of that 'equality' as well.  Judging from the casual response to the  symposium from women considered 'leaders'  in the women's movement, it seems clear  that much more work must be done to  bring women  together to work toward common  and not-so-common goals. We were challenged in our choice of panelists: 'white'  and non-'white' as we have been told. As  an aside, we searched vigorously to locate  women from middle or eastern Europe for  the afternoon panel. Those whom we located  and to whom the idea was presented,  declined.  We applaud those women who came as panelists and participants from the Mainland  and points North on Vancouver Island, at  their own expense. My very special thanks  to Maria Tzimas and Craig McFeely who  pooled their resources with mine to present this laudable symposium.  Sincerely,  Mahinder Kaur Doman  Volunteer chairperson of symposium  Lesbian Outreach  for solidarity  Kinesis:  The Lesbian Outreach Project has been  running workshops in and around Vancouver for the past year.
