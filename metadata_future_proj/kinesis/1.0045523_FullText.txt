Affirmative action at  city hall, funding for local  women's centres, rape relief,  daycare, housing, discrimination against women, and more.  Sad and maddening to say, only  one major party, COPE,- the Committee of Progressive Electors,  even had a platform on women's  issues. LSA's mayoral candidate  also spoke up for women's  issues. But for the most part,  candidates were ignorant of  women's Issues. Not only that  but they didn't believe city  hall had jurisdiction over issues affecting women. One  exception is Darlene Marzari  (IND.). She has consistently  fought for issues of major importance to women - neighbourhood planning, daycare,  training and employment for  women. Newly elected Bernice  Gerard (NPA) says she will do  her utmost to consider women's  interests, as does newcomer  Marguerite Ford (TEAM), who  also stated that she attempts  to involve women in her work  at all times.  , In an attempt to maximize the  interest in issues of concern  to women, VSW put together an  all-candidates questionnaire  on women's issues. This was  distributed with background  material to about 100 Vancouver  mayoralty, aldermanic, parks  and school board candidates  from each party, plus independents. Only a few bothered to  reply. In addition, VSW members were requested to attend  the candidates' meetings and  ask them the questions that  appeared in the November KINESIS.  Unfortunately, the structure of  the meetings mitigated against  public debate.  Each candidate  had two to six minutes to give  their "spiel." After twenty or  more of them had done this, then  there was discussion, two or  three hours later. By this time,  many candidates had left to attend other meetings.  So it was  very difficult to question the  candidates at all, let alone to  raise women's issues.  The general tone of the meetings  can probably be summed up by VSW  member Hattie Ferguson's comment:  "It was a man's meeting and they  dominated it all the way through.  Trying to pin them down with  women's issues to me was a hopeless exercise."  In any case, VSW would like to  thank the following members for  their help: Hattie Ferguson,  Linda Bolstad, Sandra Boulanger,  Jan Lancaster, Margaret Laxton,  Lisa Roges, Naomi Lis, Kilby  Day, Jane Evans, Carol Bourne,  Ada Ho, Florence Mollis, Nina  Fulford, Valerie Lys, Carol  Norman, Noreen Garrity, Nadine  Allen, Carol Pfeiffer, Susan  Hoeppner, Lee Grills, and Hanne  Jensen.  Where do we go from here? VSW  will, of course, be writing  letters to the editors of the  newspapers on the lack of coverage on women's issues in thi$  recent campaign. More importantly, however, VSW has put  together files on each elected  official, including the notes  that members kept of the all-  candidates' meetings.  whotnow?  VSW hopes to use the elected  candidates' pre-election committments (what few there were)  to lobby them later on women's  issues.  In addition, in the  spring, VSW hopes to gather a  member's committee to monitor  the weekly public city council  meetings and, perhaps later,  present city council with a  brief on municipal women's  issues.

NOWH€R£ IN SIGHT  "There is no foreseeable feminist revolution," says Rosemary Brown, NDP/MLA  for Vancouver Burrard.  She says that progress in improving the  status of women has been delayed by  lack of political action from women.  While the consciousness-raising process  is vital to feminist understanding,  Brown says, too many women get stuck in  individual navel-gazing and never apply  their new knowledge politically where  collective change takes place.  To her, inaction is inexcusable,  we  don't need any more women's social clubs.  Membership in a feminist group  real committment to work on behalf of  women's liberation. You must carry out  your responsibilities as a feminist."  Rosemary recalls that five years ago,  when Vancouver Status of Women x^as  founded, new members joined by participating in action committees which taught  them skills and required them to work.  Consciousness raising was simultaneous  with, not separate from or prior to,  action.  Since feminism is most importantly a  political movement, she sees an urgent  need for feminist organizations to get  their membership committees involved in  political action, in addition to providing services to women. One should not  be happening at the expense of the other.  Rosemary defines' political action in  its broadest sense : sitting on boards  of local agencies to give feminist input  and to monitor community decision-making;  joining trade unions; taking part in  feminist political analysis rap groups.  While she thinks feminists should individually join the political party of  their choice, or run for office, she  is not opposed to non-partisan women's  groups, so long as they are doing  political work.  ALL PAKTICS PRACTISC  SCXISM  "Women must understand that no matter  what political party they belong to,  they are oppressed. No political party  is exempt from practising sexism," she  notes.  THE WORK IS NEVER DONE  As a member of the opposition party in  B.C., Brown gets only one secretary in  Victoria. Lack of staff makes her work  exceedingly difficult. "I need a whole  feminist organization to do the job,"  she explains.  While she disagrees with the concept of  women working for free, financial  realities are something else. "Some  reliable, committed volunteers would  make my job incredibly lighter."  interview by  karen richardson  Rosemary Brown, NDP Vancouver-burrard  Several women are needed to clip the  many newspapers, and magazines which  come into her office everyday, to  precis reference material, to do research and just to keep her up-to-  date on women's issues.  The problem is the constant need to  have extensive information at her  finger-tips, when she needs it in the  legislature, and when issues arise  spontaneously.  "It is very frustrating  for me," she notes. "I can't maintain  duplicate office materials in Vancouver  and Victoria."  She accepts only one speaking engagement  in five because preparations are so  time-consuming. When asked why she  hasn't been more vOcal on feminist  issues in the press lately, she said,  unapologetically, "I haven't had time.  There is a limit to what one woman  can do."  But she is tired of feminists looking  to her for the lead. "The women's movement should be telling me what they want  to have me debate in the house, when  they want me to introduce a particular  bill on women.  They aren't using me  effectively."  WHAT'S HAPPCNCD  TO TH€ LOBBY TCAMS ??  Brown thinks that the Women's Rally  for Action, held March 22,1976,in  Victoria, was an excellent lobbying tool.  But it only scratched  the surface of MLA prejudice against  women. "It's impact will depend  entirely upon continuing pressure  from women on their own. MLA's.  If only those bloody lobby teams  will keep xrorking,"  Broxm suggests that feminists keep  sending their politicians material  and she stresses follox^-up. Feminists  must ask MLA's to comment on their  letterso  Then the politician has  to read the material, think about it  and commit her/himself to an answer.  "If they don't personally read the  material, at least they will be under  enough pressure that their secretaries  or wives will read it and keep them  informed."  The rally, she says, showed the potential for women's political power.  Since then it has not been possible  for the B.C. legislature to accuse  Rosemary of not speaking for a maioritv  of women.  FCMINISTS NOT  USING H€R.  In the spring 1977 session of the B.C.  legislature, Rosemary will be lobbying  fdr affirmative action in the provincial  civil service; community of matrimonial  property; labour standards protection  for domestic workers; and the right of  married women to change their names.  triBSf  NOT OPTIMISTIC  Brown is not optimistic about the  political future of feminism. "I  entered politics thinking that many  xromen would follow. But we seem  to be slipping backwards."  "They may be there, but I don't see  any familiar feminist faces rising  up through the ranks to political  futures. They will only be elected  through a strong, radical xromen's  movement that is vocal in the  community.  Broxm herself does not intend to stay  in politics forever. But there is one  thing she is waiting for before retiring. "We must have a women's  ministry in the provincial government."  She dismisses criticism of the women's  ministry model. "Without a central  coordinating body with that kind of  power and xvomen's branches in each  government department to support it,  women will only keep getting tokenism."

Ottawa, October 8-11.  Over 300 lesbians travelled from all  over Canada to participated in this  well-organized conference at the University of Ottawa. (We all made our  way there with no financial help -  the organizers had very little money  ..o have you ever tried to get a  grant to host a national lesbian  conference???)  There were two full days of workshops  and plenary sessions - because of  Quebec's francophone contingent  simultaneous translation was provided  at all plenaries, and French workshops  were offered. There was a wide  variety of workshop topics to choose  from:  Dyke culture, lesbians and small  communities, therapy, media,  sports, younger and older lesbians,  sexuality, lesbian mothers, lesbianism/  feminism, lesbian autonomy/pride,  lesbian businesses, and wages for  housework,  We heard two speakers : Chris Mac  Naughton - Lesbians and the Law.  Denise Goyette - "L'evolution de  la prise de conscience de la femme  homophile" (evolution of lesbian  consciousness).  Large tables were set up at the  conference site - women sold books,  T-shirts, buttons, jewellery.  Information on most lesbian issues  was readily available.  The evenings were get-together times;  a women's dance/disco one night and  a coffeehouse the next - we provided  our own entertainment. There were all  types of musicians, dancers and  comediennes amongst us. (And Rita  MacNeil sang J)  WELFARE RIGHTS  VICTORY  Due to a victory by VSW Ombudsperson,  the Department of Human Resources has  admitted that women with children  who are able to find work and who  are making the same or less than they  were on social assistance can receive  medical benefits (to include  dental, medical and prescriptions) for  at least a year after they start  working.  If you are a single parent with dependants who has been able to find employment, you will not be facing a total  lack of medical coverage.  The Department of Human Resources  was initially quite reluctant to  Impressions: Most workshops were very  large - 40 to 100 women made discussion  rather unwieldy and impersonal. Being  very familiar with the diversity of  feminists in B.C., and with the comparatively united lesbian bloc within  it, I half-expected all lesbians to  speak with one united voice on most  issues. But, no, there are many facets  to the lesbian movement in Canada:  - lesbian feminists who work within  the women's movement;  - lesbians who work in the gay rights  movement;  - the autonomous lesbians;  - the English/French split...  However, it was reassuring to get a  sense of just how large the lesbian  population is, and of the many fronts  on which lesbians are working to end  our oppression in this society. There  is so much to be done that there is  room for all!  One fact become quite clear to me as  I attended workshops and talked with  lesbians from all areas represented :  B.C. is indeed playing a leadership  role in Canada's women's movement.  This is the only province with an  umbrella organization of all women's  groups (the B.C.Federation of Women)  working to liberate all women.  This is also the only province where  lesbians are working beside feminists  in such a structure. For lesbians here  in the movement, .it seems that the  struggle for acceptance by other feminists has been a long, strenuous  one, but we have been successful.  (N.O.W. split severely over the lesbian  issue.) Lesbians from other provinces  were impressed by the strong BCFW  policy concerning lesbians. Copies of  BCFW's policy and Constitution handbook  disappeared as fast as I could put  them out on the table!!  provide the ombudsperson with any  decision. The official excuse was  that they had not developed policy  around that issue and that therefore  their hands were tied.  Their hands  became less tied, however, after  repeated phone calls, and our ombuds'  threat of appeal. Finally, she received  a call from the Department explaining  that they would be meeting the woman's  medical benefit expenses.  Every woman on welfare should know  that the new GAIN regulations state  that " the Director may authorize  and administer authority to provide  payment for health care services  within the provisions of Schedule F  of these regulations, to :(f) a single  parent with a dependant child (ii)  who previously received income assistance authorized under section 1 of  Schedule A of these regulations but,  by reason of the parent obtaining  employment, is self-supporting and  continues to be a resident of the  Province of B.C."  It is becoming apparent that we have  a responsibility to expand the lines  of communication between B.C. and the  other provinces. After all, revolutionary steps towards a movement where  all women are united, are being made  here - we, too, are holding exciting  conventions, and developing new theories, so often we neglect to send  articles to existing feminist and lesbian publications, so they can distribute this type of information. How  will we acquire a sense of national  unity if we communicate only sporadically with the rest of Canada?  "Strategy for a Lesbian Movement" was  the topic of discussion for the exciting closing plenary of the conference.  We could not simply return home without some plan to preserve the sense  of unity, potential and power in  numbers that most of us felt after  being together for three days. This  final resolution was passed unanimously  by the conference:  Be is resolved that:  A National Affiliation of Lesbians and  Lesbian Organizations be formed in  order to communicate and formulate  lesbian issues and concerns. Further,  we propose that this resolution he  circulated by mail to all known  lesbian organizations and individuals  for their consideration and response.  Further, we propose that' a committee  be set up from this conference to  handle responses, with the idea of  holding an organizational conference  within a year.  That gives everyone a lot to look  forward to in the coming year! The .  Lesbians of Ottawa Now (LOON) are  preparing a post-convention packet  to be distributed soon.

(736 3746)  Beneath the bureaucratic gobbledee-  gook there is a right to which single  parents are entitled : medical benefits  for themselves and their dependants  for a year after they start work, if  they make the same or less at that  job as they were making on income  assistance. Don't let any official  tell you that you don't have this  right.  To encourage the growth of a more  creative women's graffiti, Kinesis  has built a graffiti wall. Hi folks! I saved s£ many $$$$ss on  my welfare budget this year, I'm giving  y'all an elegantly thin Christmas bonus.  All those handicapped people and senior  citizens better get off the queue.  Nothing for you!  A contemporary Christmas Carol,  J£  starring our most 'colourful'  minister, in full SocredVision.  Happy 1977, folks!  UNCLC SCROOGC POSING AS SANTA  No,Virginia, Vander Zalm is not Santa.  But he does bear a fine resemblance to  another folk hero, Uncle Scrooge.  On November 5th, we heard the good news  on our radios. Generous Vander Zalm  and his Department of Human Resources  had announced their Christmas bonuses  for those on income assistance. All of  $25 maximum for each family, and  $15 dollars for each single person  without dependents.  It goes a long  way towards putting macaroni on the  Christmas table.  What we didn't hear was that various  groups had been excluded from the  Christmas bonus, among them handicapped  persons and senior citizens. The Department policy states : "Those not  eligible for the Christmas bonus  include those who are children in the  home of relatives, those in institutions where a comforts allowance is  paid, those in personal and intermediate care homes and hostels, as well  as those in receipt of GAIN or  H.P.I.A."  This fancy language means that handicapped persons and senior citizens  will miss out.  The majority of senior citizens on  income assistance are women who,  after a lifetime of unpaid work in  the home, and poorly paid waged work  in the worst jobs, are facing old age  with no financial security.  Was this denial of Christmas bonuses  made because our handicapped people  and senior citizens are already so  well cared for? No. In keeping  with our thrifty government's policy  of fiscal restraint in inflationary times, the income which these  two groups receive HAS ACTUALLY  GONE DOWN!  The total family benefits where two  parents or both spouses are handicapped,  or 60 years or older, is as follows:  (a) 3 persons receive $545. They used  to receive $690.  (b) 4 persons receive $580. They used  to receive $800.  The drop in rates for other categories  within this group is consistent with  this pattern.  Now let's look at the total family  benefits where one parent or the spouse  is handicapped, or 60 years or older:  (a) 2 persons (one adult,one child)  receive $355. They used to receive  $425,  (b) 2 persons, both adults, receive  $375. They used to receive $425.  (c) 3 persons now receive $405. They  used to receive $535.  Add Vander Zalm to your Christmas mail list. Thank him for keeping  your tax-payers dollars away from those spendthrift welfare folks.  part time worK:  what are the issues?  Should more part time jobs be  created or encouraged by government? This was one of the  questions raised at a Nov. 23  open forum sponsored by the  Women's Committee of the Provincial NDP.  Although set up as a "debate"  with Jean Rands (SORWUC),  Judy Paterson (NDP Women's  Committee Chairwoman), and  Judy Korbin (CALFAA) on panel,  there did not appear to be  pre-decided sides to be defended.  The meeting, instead,  acted as a vehicle to determine what the issues are,  rather than which issues are  correct.  Interesting points  _  and questions were raised.  Approximately 21-24% of the  women employed in B.C. are part  time workers.  Rands felt that  most of them were working part  time because they wanted to,  specifically because of family  and home demands.  Some discussion ensued regarding whether  or not demanding full benefits  for part time work was also  further entrenching women in  their "indispensable" roles as  mother and homemaker.  Someone  suggested that employers should  be encouraged to reduce working  hours for men and women, while  maintaining full benefits and  pay. That way men could participate more in the family.  doss issue  Another member of the audience  pointed out that while professional women could afford to  work part time, working-class  women could not, and, therefore,  the underlying issue was a class  issue.  One of the few men in the audience outlined some of the reasons  why part time workers would be  hard to organize, including their  self and other image as marginal,  and employer resistance to the  costs of paying full benefits  (some of which can't be prorated)  $  $  c*  for half work.  (Although some  studies have shown that production is almost as high for  half day workers as for full  time workers.)  No solutions or policy were  formulated, however, the consensus seemed to be that part  time work is a reality, and  those workers should have the  same benefits and job security  as full time workers. That  kind of solidarity could only  strengthen labour's position,  not weaken it. Ontario   family law reform  Two years after the Ontario Law  Reform Commission recommended changes  in family law, the Ontario government  has introduced new legislation,  which, they claim, will "abolish  the last remnants of the married  woman's inferior status."  The extremely complex new legislation  aims at redefining property rights,  support obligations, marriage  contracts, common law spouses, and  the functions of family courts.  If the new bill is passed, home-  makers will automatically be entitled to a part of the marriage  estate upon divorce, even if they  have not contributed capital directly.  This will finally recognise the  value of their work and their real  contribution to the marriage.  Support laws have been revised so  that children, even those born outside the marriage, have to be supported until they are sixteen. The  concept of support has been extended to cover common-law spouses.  After two years of cohabiting, such  spouses will be treated as legal  marriages in as much as they will  be under the same obligation to  support each other and their children as married people will be. This,  it is claimed, will remove the  stigma from common law marriages.  Sounds great?  For years, women have been fighting  for an equal distribution of assets  upon marriage breakdown. But does  this legislation really represent  a victory for feminist rights? It  does not.  It does, however, grant  women the 'right' to be equally  responsible for the support of  their families. This despite the  fact that women earn less than men,  and are the harder hit by the  desperate need for daycare.  The real thrust of this legislation  is not to work towards the true  equality of women and men, but to  prop up the tottering institution  of marriage. Attorney General of  Ontario, Roy McMurtry admitted as  much. The new legislation on  common law marriages should, he  says, "act as an encouragement for  common law couples to regularise  their situation by entering a formal  marriage." Only then will they be  able to enter into contracts outlining rights to property, to  support and to the custody and  care of children.  It is in the interests of our provincial governments to emphasise  the obligations of couples to support  each other and their children. It  relieves them of the responsibility  of providing adequate social services.  "Saving the tax-payers dollar", they  call it. Again, Attorney General  Roy McMurtry explains: "certainly  it is more desirable to place a  support obligation on common-law  spouses than have a large number  of persons who are living common  law looking to public welfare for  support instead." More desirable  for whom??  Many details of the legislation  have yet to be publicised and discussed, but feminists across the  country will be checking it out  carefully. We have fought too  long and too hard to be fooled by  false promises of equality.  The Ontario Tory government cannot  hide behind the claim that they  are abolishing women's inferior  status if all they are really doing  is evading their responsibility for  providing adequate social services  by thrusting the burden of support  back upon individual families.  Kinesis will be evalutating the legislation carefully when more details  are available, and will report on  the briefs which will be presented  by the public before its final  reading in the House.  alberta   govt* arrogance  Alberta feminists are speaking of  October 29 as Black Friday.  That's the day Alberta's Deputy  Premier, Hugh Horner, told them:  "We have equality in Alberta. If  it was any other way I could stand  before you and agree there is a  need for the government to create  a ministerial portfolio for a group  without rights."  Horner was addressing the 200 women  at the Alberta Status of Women  Action Committee's first annual  convention. Horner was responding  to the ASWAC brief, Joint Initative:  a Goal for Women in Government,  which has as its key demands the  appointment of a minister directly  responsible for the status of women,  and the formation of a cabinet  committee on equal opportunity.  In a series of remarks distinguished  as much by their blatant racism  as by their sexism, Horner told  the delegates (several of whom he  addressed as 'dear') : "To create  a ministership responsible for the  status of women would be an act  of discrimination...not against  men, but against women." (sic)  If women were asking for a ministry  especially for themselves, Horner  said, they were actually saying  that they were in the same position  as Alberta's native population,  which has 'some real problems.'  Horner said that Indians needed  a special department with a minister,  but women didn't, because "they  could take care of themselves."  Horner said that Indian people  needed a special department with  a minister, but women didn't,  because "they could take care of  themselves."  'we have equality  in alberta9  Horner pointed to the Alberta Human  Rights Bill and the Individual Rights  Protection Act to support his stance  that no further action need be taken.  Yet the annual report from the Human  Rights Commission, filed in the house  earlier in October, reported (surprise  surprise) that "...black people  are still being refused service in  some restaurants, native people  have been refused the use of washroom facilities provided by the  service stations, and some business  firms still refuse to treat women  as responsible adults."  In Horner's opinion, women should  not ask the government "for more  structures" but should eliminate  their problems by "grasping opport-  unites when they appear."  Meanwhile, Premier Peter Lougheed  has rejected the possibility of  further discussion of most of the  issues raised by the Alberta Status  of Women Action Committee. "It's  our view that any further discussion  aimed at altering the government's  position from an organization point  of view would not be productive,"  he told the House.  Fotheringham has been quoted as  saying that Alberta males think  more of their horses than they do  of their women. It looks as though  he may be right.  Drop Deputy Hugh Horner a line at  the Parliament Buildings, Edmonton,  and let him know what you think  of paternalism.  Lorna Marsden, National Action  Committee president, warned delegates  at the convention that a backlash  of public opinion against women's  issues may be developing. Despite  much publicity about the increasing  opportunities for women, she noted,  women are still kept apart, as  a "segregated group" in the labour  force. Moreover, she said, the  unemployment rate among women in  Canada is much higher than "we  suspected... and unconnected to  the cyclic unemployment plaguing  the male (labour) force."  The women's movement is in danger  of losing momentum, she said. Tbw,  more than ever, it is imperative  for women to organize in a unified  manner, and not to permit solidary  to be corroded by in-fighting. MORGENTALER   they want another pound of flesh  Once again, Dr. Henry Morgentaler is  facing charges for having performed  an illegal abortion.  He has already  been tried, and acquitted, three  times.  But apparently this is not  enough for the Quebec Superior Court  nor for Justice Minister Ron Basford.  Basford claims that he does not want  to interfere in the administration of  justice in Quebec.  The fourth trial date has now been  set for December 13.  The history of Morgentaler's harassment by the government is infamous.  You will remember that he was acquitted by a jury on the first charge in  1973, but was forced to serve 10  months in prison two years later when  the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned  the jury's verdict, and when the Supreme Court upheld that decision. You  will also remember that while still  in jail, Morgentaler was charged on  a second count, and again acquitted.  When a re-trial followed, he was  acquitted once more.  He now faces  eight remaining charges.  In pressing ahead with these extra  eight charges, the law is intent upon  proving itself an ass yet one more  time.  Even The Globe and Mail editorial (which is not exactly noted for  its progressive opinions) said on  September 20th, that a conviction on  any of the remaining charges, following the first three jury acquittals,  would indicate that "the State, through  brute force, has finally forced a jury  to bend to its will." John Diefen-  baker claims that it would be a throwback to the times when British kings  would lock their juries up, without  heat or food, in an attempt to make  them render a decision favourable to  the Crown.  But the trial of Dr. Morgentaler is  not simply a justice issue. What is  on trial, and the reason why Morgentaler has been so relentlessly persecuted, is the question of a woman's  right to abortion on demand.  Had the  issue been anything other than abortion, this charade of trial after  trial would simply not be taking place.  The charges would have been dropped  years ago. As Morgentaler himself  repeatedly points out, his case has  everything to do with abortion.  The fight for humane abortion legislation has been a central is^ue within the women's movement, both here  and abroad.  Last April, the issue  was instrumental in bringing down an  Italian government. Rosalynn Carter  regretted that abortion became the  #1 issue throughout her campaign.  The gross inequities in the workability and application of the current  "therapeutic" abortion programs have  been recognized by the Canadian Bar  Association.  This September, the  Bar's criminal justice section supported a proposal by the Quebec Bar  that all abortion trials be postponed  until parliament reviews the law.  The Badgeley Commission on Abortion  will be tabling its report to the  Justice Minister very soon, and presumably it will bring to light even  more clearly the asinine nature  of the 'Äûcurrent lax^s.  The injustice of the government's  treatment of Morgentaler becomes more  and more obvious to the Canadian public every time he is brought to trial.  The dropping of the charges against  him will not only uphold the democratic right of any person to be  tried by a jury of his/her peers,  but will bring pressure upon the  Justice Minister for the removal  of abortion from the Criminal Code  once and for all.

The CIA-promoted  military coup of September '73 has  made sure of that. It continues to  torture thousands of Chilean people  despite condemnation from the U.N.  What can we, as Canadian feminists,  do about it?  We can educate ourselves about the  resistance which is being organised  in Canada against the regime. In the  lower mainland, a group of Chileans  and Canadians who are concerned  about the violation of human rights  in Chile have organised to form a  committee : The Committee for the  Defense of Human Rights in Chile.  Their main office is at 906-207  West Hastings St, Vancouver. Phone  669 5545.  The main objectives of this  committee are (a) to denounce the  torture in Chile, (b) to keep the  Bo Co public informed about the  resistance struggle both inside  and outside Chile, and (c) to  centralize all the available  information on the repression  so that it can effectively carry  out campaigns which will contribute  to the eventual release of Chilean  political prisoners.  While we recognise that all political  prisoners in Chile must be released,  our particular focus can be upon  the thousands of women prisoners.  Women and children are often non-  recognized prisoners. They are  prisoners whose arrest is not  acknowledged by the Junta despite  testimonies from witnesses and fellow-  prisoners who have seen them in  torture centres and concentration  camps. Because of their non-recognized status the Junta can torture  and kill them with impunity.  Every month in Santiago, there are  about 120 arrests. Of these, only  6% are made by orders. Of those  arrested, more than 77% disappear.  Women prisoners are subject to the  most savage treatment imaginable.  Women are repeatedly raped and  beaten. As a result, they can become  pregnant. Of course, they receive  no medical aid, and both they and  their babies can die, and often do.  Live animals and metal objects are  introduced into the vaginas of women  prisoners. Electrical currents  are applied to the vagina and breasts.  The list of tortures is appalling;  and it goes on and on.  Each month, Kinesis will publish  a list of five women prisoners.  All readers are urged to write  on their behalf.  In coordination with similar  committees all around the world,  the Vancouver Committee for the  Defense of Human Rights in Chile,  organises monthly letter-writing  campaigns. These massive world-wide  campaigns have already placed a  tremendous strain on Chile's  postal and censor system. The Junta  recently reported that $10 million  dollars worth of postage are  spent monthly throughout the world  on letter-writing campaigns. These  campaigns demoralize the dictatorship while offering inspiration  and support to those who oppose  the Junta.  Even if our lives are committed  to many local actions, we can  find time to write several letters  each month.  The list of women prisoners for  December is:  AYRES MORENO, Luz de las Nieves.  She was a student of cinema arts,  and she is 27 years old. She was  arrested on January 1, 1974 by  the SIM (Military Intelligence Service).  She has been at the Londres and Tejas  Verdes torture houses, and at the  Tres Alamos concentration camp. She  has been tortured in these ways:  raped by four officers, had rats  and pieces of metal inserted into  her vagina, and has suffered a  fractured skull. Her situation is  critical, and probably irreversible.  Her father and brother are also in  jail. Sweden has offered her a visa.  The most recent news said that she  would be in the lists of prisoners  to go to Germany. That was in June.  Nothing has been heard since.  PENA HERREROS, Michela. She was an  Engineering student at the Technical  University. She's 24.  She's now  pregnant, with a negative RH and  delicate health. She was detained  on June 20, 1975.  BATASZEW CONTRERAS,Beatriz Constanza.  She was detained on December 12,1974  by the DINA (Gestapo-style military  intelligence)agents. She is single,  pregnant, and is now being held at  Tres Alamos concentration camp. Her  student idenitity card in Santiago  was No.6378669.  ALLENDA CANTILLANO, Ana Gladys.  She was a student in San Felipe,  and has been sentenced to 10 years  in jail. Currently she is being  held at Buen Pastor, San Felipe.  BUSTILLOS, Maria Teresa.

In  this commentary they explain why  and how they organised, and they  place their work within a feminist  perspective.  The impluse for AFWIC (Action for  Women in Chile) came out of an informal gathering of women in November  '74. There were about half a dozen  of us, some Latin American, some  North American. All of us were  active, in one way or another, in  the women's movement. All of us  were concerned about Chile.  Our starting point was profound  outrage. We knew of the violent,  large-scale repression in Chile  which had begun with the CIA-aided  coup in September of 1973.  We had all read many accounts  of the sexually sadistic treatment  of women political prisoners in  jails. We knew that children had  been tortured as hostages in order  to force their mothers and fathers  to surrender. We knew we could  not remain silent any longer.  "When we began to meet formally as  Action for Women in Chile, our  first priority was to build concrete support for the Chilean  people; our strategy was to spread  the word about conditions in Chile.  Because we were feminists, because  our outrage was deeply tied out  our feminist consciousness, we  decided to focus our efforts on  building support in the US women's  movement for Chilean women and  children.  We organised many kinds of activities,  distributed posters, leaflets,  buttons, and circulated petitions  for the release of women political  prisoners in Chile. We held a series  of events in which we told the  story of the Chilean struggle  through films, talks, music and  poetry. We mailed informational  packets to thousands of women.  Wherever there were gatherings or  conferences of women, we  raised the  issue of Chile and need for support  from women in the United States,  In the process, we grew, and we  began to see our actions as part  of a broader struggle. United in  our support for the Chilean resistance, we became increasingly committed to building a force able to  present itself as a challenge to  U.S. policies that continue to  intervene in Chilean affairs.  Today we are still motivated by  the same anger that fired us at  that first gathering, and our activities are still varied and many.  But increasingly our anger has  been informed by our thinking and  learning together. We can see the  links between U.S. imperialism  abroad, the oppression of women,  Third World people, and all xrork-  ing people here in the U.S. We  understood U.S. involvement in  Chile not as an isolated case where  the U.So intervened and was caught  in the act, but rather as the  product of a system of imperialism  that defines and tries to implement  its policies around the globe. In  other words, we see that our struggle  is an international one: that our  XTOrk is not only support but also  solidarity.  In adddition, by studying the lessons  of Chile, we have learned much about  the crucial incorporation of women  into the struggle for socialism.  By raising the demands of the  Chilean women'in their struggle  against imperialism, we are raising  the demands of all oppressed women.  By freeing our sisters in Chile, we  are freeing ourselves.  Over 20 million women in Africa today  are the victims of genital mutilation,  which is practised in more than 26  countries across Africa from Dakar  to Mogadishu.  In 1960, African participants in  the World Health Organization  asked that organization to undertake a medical study of all aspects  of the genital mutilation of females.^  The Economic and Social Council of  the UN has also asked that such a  study be undertaken. We are now  approaching 1977 and nothing has  been done. Most Canadian and American feminists are unaware that  such mutilation practices are  widespread.  Female circumcision is the popular but technically incorrect  name for a variety of genital  mutilations. The mildest form of  mutilation is the removal of the  tip of the clitoris. The term for  this is sunna circumcision.  Excision, or clitoridectomy, is the  removal of the entire clitoris,  together with the adjacent parts of  the labia minor.  Infibulation is the removal of the  whole clitoris, the labia minor and  parts of the labia majora as well.  Once these parts have been removed,  the two sides of the vulva are then  closed over, except for a small  passage at the back, which allows  for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. Women who have been  infibulated have to be cut open to  have intercourse and further cut  open to permit the delivery of a  child. Sometimes, they are closed  off icon women  up again after the delivery : the  decision is left up to the husband.  During their reproductive lives,  women are subjected to these operations with each childbirth.  No records are kept of the number  of deaths relating to this practice.  Traditionally, the removal of the  clitoris was a way of fostering  faithfulness and morality.  Sunna circumcision and excision is  practised on females of about 12  to 14, before the onset of menstruation.  Infibulation is performed on  children from about 4 to 8 years.  The smaller the opening of the  vulva, the higher the traditional  bride price. All of these forms of  mutilation are taking place today,  in modernized sectors of Africa.  To defend them on the grounds of  preserving tradition is the same  as defending slavery as a cultural  heritage.  The immediate results of such kinds  of circumcision include haemmorrhage,  severe shock and numerous infections.  Side effects include: tetanus, blood-  poisoning and gangrene. Long term  results include difficulties in passing urine and menstrual blood,  genital infections leading to infertility and difficult childbirth.  The majority of the women in the  fudan today are infibulated. Claims  that infibulation is extremely rare  and confinded to only the most  rural areas are simply incorrect.  International Health programs  ignore genital mutilation and  Western Aid programs in health  care, including those organised by  US AID, refuse to recognize this  tortue of women, 'explaining that t  they have 'other priorities.'  African women have demanded that  this issue be dealt with, and they  have not been heard.  The nasty  topic is swept under the rug at  national and international levels.  It is time all women spoke up in  support of the African women, and  protested to the Human Rights Commission of the UN. The practice of  female mutilation must be investigated, publicized and eradicated.  Write to FRAN HOSKEN, editor of  WIN NEWS (Women's International  Network), who is preparing a protest to the UN. Address: 187  Grant Street, Lexington, MA  02173, USA. Tell her that we are  not interested in 'rescue' work,  but in supporting demands already  made by African women,  WIN news is* quite vague about the  way in which this practice divides  up along socio-economic lines. Ask  Hosken for more details. NORTHERN NOTCS     diana bisscll  Dear Sisters:  When I last wrote it was mid-October  and I was about to land at the Whitehorse airport - now it's mid-November  and Prince George had a first taste  of snow last night.  There was snow  on the ground a month ago in Whitehorse and the temp hovered around  zero most of the time.  What a tremendous group of women in Whitehorse!  I'm so glad the people at the Victoria  Faulkner Women's Centre asked me to  come up - the 3 day/3 night itinerary  was booked for every minute, including  a major discussion of "goals and objectives of the Centre", a verbal  self-defense workshop, meetings with  native women at the Friendship Centre,  visits to Northern Lights Daycare,  the Yukon Women's Mini-bus office,  etc.  The women's centre has been open  since mid '74 and has received monies  for operations and staff from Secretary of State since that time.  At  present, there is one part time coordinator on staff and she reports to  the Centre Committee - a "board"  elected each year from the volunteer  body that makes up the active force  of the centre.  Jane Rockwell, the  coordinator, makes sure the centre is  staffed all day, ansxrers crisis calls,  counsels women, and helps t,o put together the centre program.  The newsletter (The Optimst) is put out by a  committee that is separate from the  Centre and has in the past received  separate monies.  They are presently  doing fundraising in order to continue  putting out an issue once every two  months and while I was there they  raised over $200 on a raffle of a  large basket of imported coffees/teas  /mugs and melitta coffee pot.  (Another fundraising idea that worked  for the Centre was a hike-a-thon -  approximately 30 sponsored "hikers"  raised $1,531.00 this summer on a 15-  mile hike on Grey Mtn - complete x^ith  St. John's Ambulance, checkpoints, CB  radios and all.)  Apart from the really successful verbal self-defense evening (30 women  showed up and my voice which had been  rapidly disappearing all day due to a  cold absolutely vanished), the really  worthwhile session was the one we did  on "goals and objectives".  Women  actively involved in the Centre (and  others) had been questioning the direction of the Centre for some time -  some were wanting it to become more  politically active active, others were  afraid that the "ordinary" women who  had been turning up at the Centre in  droves would stop coming if they felt  the Centre was becoming too "radical"  It was felt by some that if women  wanted to become more political they  could help re-energize the Yukon  Status of Women Council which had  been such a potent force a few years  earlier and had dissolved somewhat  after getting the Women's Centre and  the Yukon Women's Mini-bus Society on  the road.  I really don't know how to  describe what happened at that small  meeting, but somehow we worked through  from the personal to the political -  recognizing that the very existence  of the women's centre was a political  point, discussing how we have been  taught to avoid getting involved in  "politics", and working out ways of  involving Centre women in outward  action, and deciding to liaise with  the new Status of Women Council, a-  voiding a potentially divisive situation.  I tell this story because it  happens over and over again - and  each group thinks they are the "only  ones".  It's my feeling that this  situation is common to many of the  service oriented women's centres, and  that the asking of the question "What  are we really doing" is not fatal -  as a matter of fact - it's more fatal  not to ask it.  If anyone wants to subscribe to the  Optimst, or wants more information  about the Victoria Faulkner Women's  Centre and how they have managed to  make things work for them in Whitehorse, write to them af 302 Steele  Street, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.  I got a ride to Atlin (115 miles south  of Whitehorse) with a friend of a  Centre member, and three of the passengers in the car were Atlin students  who have chosen to continue their education beyond Grade 9 and therefore  have to board in Whitehorse and go to  school there.  The Atlin school just  doesn't have enough enrollment to  justify having Grades 10-12. A recent  study showed that 36% of the male students do not continue beyond Grade 9  and 80% of the female students do not  continue beyond Grade 9 - shocking  proof of the fact that people still  see education as a worthwhile investment for boys, but a doubtful one for  girls.  Spent 3 days in Atlin at Mary-Dawn and  Mel Rippell's home - met some of the  active women of the community, discussed women's issues, discussed Atlin  issues and was enthralled with the incredible beauty of the gigantic mountains and glaciers clustering around  Atlin Lake - the second largest lake  in B.C.  The area was highly populated  during the gold rush days and there  are scores of abandoned mines, old  buildings, and machinery as well as a  strong sense of history that permeates  the present day lives of the residentsr  Atlin's population of 350 is not e-  nough to warrant even a CBC receiver,  there is no television, no doctor, no  child welfare officer, no magistrate,  and the nearest town is Whitehorse -  115 miles away. Given those circumstances, I think it's possible to  understand why some of the women found  it difficult to separate the women's  issues from the "people" issues -  yet they were really interested in  hearing of how women's groups in other  small areas formed around specific  issues as well as contributing to action on matters of province or nationwide concern.  As well, we talked a-  bout those education statistics and  what they proved about attitudes towards women and education - thus  making the link between a "people" and  a "women's" issue. Mary-Dawn is going  to have some video-tapes sent up on  Women and the Law to help stimulate  more discussion.  I was really interested in that  article on Women and Urban Planning by  Viviane Hotz because one of the key  issues that a number of us are working  on up here is the area of women and  economic development •- sp-ecif ically  regarding the planning and development of single industry towns. We  have put together the "Northern B.C.  Women's Task Force on Single Industry  Resource Communities" with organizers  in Mackenzie, Fraser Lake and Kitimat.  The purpose is to assist and involve  women living in these resource communities in defining the needs of those  communities as they relate to women  and to develop techniques that will  more effectively identify the problems  relevant to women in single industry  resource communities.  Northerners are  very concerned about the kind of economic and resource development that  happens here generally, and because of  the problems uncovered in the single  industry communities that are specific  to women we have put the Task Force together to create a focus on the whole  issue.  If anyone has any material  that would be useful, or would like to  know more about the Task Force, just  write me at 210-550 Victoria, Prince  George or call 564-2311.  I'd love to tell you all about the bus  system that the Yukon women are running  and about the tremendous lunch 20 of  us had in a one-room log cabin along  the Alaska Highway but there's no more  time/space at the moment.  P€OPL€'S LAW  This is the second in a series of  columns explaining how to use the  Small Claims Court. Small Claims is  a Court in which the layperson can  sue a person who caused her/him  some damage, where the amount involved  is less than $1,000.00, or less.  The first thing to decide is in  which Small Claims Court to start  your action (claim). The event which  gave rise to your claim is called the  'cause of action'. You can sue where  the 'cause of action' arises. For  example, if there is a car accident  the cause of action arises at the  scene, and if someone breaks a contract to pay you money or goods, the  cause of action arises at the place  where the contract is formed or broken.  You can also sue in the place where  the other party (the defendant)  lives. Therefore, you must decide  which place to sue, based on either  where the cause of action arises or  where the defendant lives. If you  have any doubts, contact the Clerk of  the Small Claims Court for advice.  The next step it to decide who to  sue. This is relatively easy where  the defendant is a person. You merely  need their full name and address. Where  you are suing a business you have to  determine whether or not it is incorporated. Incorporation means that  the company is legally registered in  Victoria. You should write to the  Registrar of Companies, Parliament  Buildings, Victoria (enclose $1.00),  and ask for a search of the company's  name.  If the company is incorporated, you  name the company on the summons (the  document that starts the action). If  it is not incorporated, you sue the  owner individually and indicate that  he carries on business under a certain  name, i.e. :"Joe Smith, carrying on  business as Smith's Plumbing."  Future columns will explain how to  issue the summons and prepare for  the trial. For more information,  contact the Vancouver People's Law  School, 681 5732. This KINESIS section on BCFW folds out as a supplement. It focusses on reactions and opinions, and does not  concentrate upon the many factual details concerning the convention, which will become available as BCFW minutes.  bcjw: annual convention  THE THIRD ANNUAL CONVENTION OF  THE BRITISH COLUMBIA FEDERATION  OF WOMEN took place on November  5, 6 and 7, in Vernon, B.C.  This was a policy-gathering convention, attended by delegates  from the numerous member groups  throughout B.C.  Kinesis asked Kate Swann, a member  of the convention planning committt-  ee, and a former coordinator, of the  BCFW, to give her perspective upon  the significance of this convention  for the BCFW.  "The first convention", Swann explained, " was our founding convention. The second was devoted to  developing our constitution, which  makes our philosophy explicit.  This convention, our third, was the  policy gathering one, and it's the  one that will make action possible.  Now we have the policy and the mechanics for acting upon that policy.  This coming year should be action-  oriented,"  Exactly how was the policy gathered?  "Policy was solicited from any interested member group," Kate Swann said.  "It was brought to the plenary session  only after small-group discussion.  Every member group had the power to  write policy, and workshops, at which  any delegate"could propose policy  amendments, were open to all delegates on every area of policy,"  Now, how does action happen? "The  action", Kate responded, "will happen  via the sub-committees which can  enact policy at the community level.  The action will grow up through the  'grass roots'."  What about the controversy at the  convention?  "Yes," replied Kate,  "there was controversy. But I'm pleased  with the way the convention dealt  with its problematic issues, with  the breadth of opinion expressed.  Women in the movement differ in terms  of political ideology. This is something we must expect and something  we must be constructive about, We  are strong enough to be able to stop  being timid about those differences  which we all know do exist."  How do you feel after the Convention?  "I'm excited," says Kate, "that now  we do have a really province-wide  organization, with representatives  from many different parts of BoC;  that we have such breadth of policy;  and,-most of all, that we have so  many sub-committees, because that's  where the action will come from."  Finally, what of the future? "Next  year will be one like nobody has  ever seen," she concluded.  BCFW's 3rd Annual Convention  BCFW has a variety of new subcommittees: Intercultural; Transition Houses; Concerns of Northern Women; Collective Action  Organizing. There are, in addit-  ition, several continuing or  revived ones: Rights of Lesbians,  Health, and Education. For more  details call Susan Sanderson at  734 2827.  was a working convention  All readers are urged to obtain  copies of the new BCFW policy from  their member groups. As a member  group, VSW will have some copies in  the library, when such copies become  available.  This summary of policy is of necessity extremely sketchy. All we can  do here is suggest the range of the  policy, and the variety of issues  covered, Policy around EDUCATION;  TRANSITION HOUSES; RAPE and GENERAL  ACTION are omitted only because of  space contraints.  The first policy area discussed was  that of HEALTH. Three main areas  were covered without controversy.  These were that the 'special consent'  requirements for abortions be dropped;  that the training of midwives for  home and birth centre births be encouraged; and that a woman should  have the right to have persons of  her choice present when she is giving  birth.  Proposed policy concerning CORE  FUNDING was strongly challenged.  Opponents to the resolution pointed  out that funding is one of the  time-honoured methods of co-option  used in Canada. There is always .  a disguised cost when government s  hand out dollars : the reworking  of our aims and goals and the  dispersal of our energies. Defendants of the resolution pointed  out that women's centres perform  a legitimate public service, and  that money belongs not to governments but to the people who make  it.  It was recommended that the BCFW  should pass no new resolutions in  the area of CHILDCARE policy. What  we need at this time is more childcare, not more policy. It was also  recommended that, in order to build  a base for action, BCFW should  support all actions taken by any  group in the area of childcare, as  long as those actions are consistent  with the already-existing BCFW  childcare policy.  The thrust of these recommendations was to direct BCFW outward,  into the community, where it can  unite with other groups for  concerted action.  MENTAL HEALTH policy adopted at the  ) convention emphasised the necessity  of educating psychiatrists about the  implications of sexim in this society, BCFW advocates that electroconvulsive treatment be banned in  all B.C. mental hospitals. Another  resolution dealt with problems  surrounding voluntary committal,  calling for an 'informed consent'  form to be given to every woman  concerning all the possible side-  effects of the treatment being proposed.  Regarding LESBIAN RIGHTS, two resolutions were proposed. One  broadened the definition of 'family'  in the Federal Immigration Act  to include one or more adults,  plus dependent children, who see  themselves as a family unit. The  second adds 'sexual orientation'  to the list of characteristics  on the basis of which the Public  Service Employment Act may not  discriminate.  MEDIA resolutions x^ere aimed largely  at encouraging women to (a) boycott  products and programs which are  sexist; (b)use fully the feminist  communications channels which exist,  and; (3) protest the way in which  women are exploited in the media  through the use of sex-typed language.  LABOUR POLICY covered three area^'ñ†  it resolved that all 16 statutes  dealing with minimum standards  labour legislation be codified into  one piece of legislation; that  the BCFW support the principle  of trade union rights, legislative  rights and fringe benefits for  all women, including domestic,  part-time, seasonal, temporary  and agricultural workers; that  BCFW press the provincial government  to institute, in conjunction with  unions, an affirmative action program that has been approved by  BCFW and other groups in the women's  movement.  HUMAN RIGHTS. A substantial amount  of human rights policy was passed  at the convention. Briefly, several  sections of the Human Rights Code  - dealing with property owners'  and tenants' rights, equality of  job opportunity and advancement,  and employment practices - were  improved by adding, where applicable,  the following instances where discrimination should be prohibted:  sexual orientation, parental status,  marital status, age, source of income, and choice of living arrangement.  Policy proposed by the Rights of  WOMEN IN PRISON provisional subcommittee focussed on gaining  maximum support from member groups  of BCFW for the movement seeking  self-determination and due process  for women and men in prison. One  resolution specifically advocated  that BCFW*support, at its discretion, independent supervisory bodies  which are formed to oversee correctional decisions and processes. BCFW CONVCNTION  REACTIONS  After such an exhilarating and exhausting weekend, the words to describe my thoughts seem lacking.  However, it was great to be a part  of the Standing Committee last year,  to watch the membership grow, to  watch the number of interim regional representatives grow, and to have  participated in organizing the convention.  As the new Coordinator, I think it's  fantastic that the 1976/77 Standing  Committee is composed of 29 women  filling 30 positions! There are 10  regional representatives, leaving  only 2 regions represented by interim reps, seven chairpeople of subcommittees and 11 task positions.  The Standing Committee now represents  women from all areas of B.C.  This convention was a first in several ways: the first delegate convention for BCFW and the B.C. women's  movement, the first time that the  election of candidates centred on  political issues rather than personalities, and the first convention  based primarily on discussing and  passing policy. Next year, these  firsts will no longer be new to BCFW;  therefore, the next convention may  take a different focus and format.  The formation of six new subcommittees  is a result of the general feeling  expressed by women at the convention  that BCFW is now ready for action.  This action will involve such things  as member groups and the education  subcommittee working with the B.C.  Teachers Federation to pressure local  schoolboards to implement the women's  studies course.  As well as the  Collective Action Strategy Subcommittee conducting workshops to teach  lobbying and research skills to women  in member groups which can be used  for long-term boycotting and picketing of retail stores on a province-  wide basis, along with organizing a  mass action to deface sexist billboards with the intent of serving as  an educational tool for the public.  BCFW is reaching the position of having  a strong base of member groups and  subcommittees who can initiate action:  We are truly a federation of women's  groups working to implement change in  B.C.  Susan Sanderson, BCFW Coordinator for  '76 - '77  One thing that I realized at this  gathering was that the women's  movement, even a segment which could  largely agree to certain basic principles and goals, is not a homogenous group. Means, perhaps ends  differ. Women from all over B.C.,  rural, small town, and urban, still  and always will be responding to  different situations and problems  while working on basically the same  types of discrimination and abuse.  Women's centres, largely replaced  in Vancouver by service groups, are  just beginning to thrive, be used,  or formed in other areas of the  province. Women from northern areas  feel their remoteness from the current of the women's movement and  other feminists, while discovering  that even up North, conditions for  women vary from town to town.  Ann Daskal of Mom's Repairs  What happened at BCFW. Schools of thought contend...  I was one of the many women from  all over the province to attend  the 'Action Meeting' at Capilano  College in May, 1974, The idea  of an umbrella organization for  women to focus their energy and  power for the common good was  exciting, to say the least, I  was unable to attend the founding  convention, but have attended the  last two. It is my intention to  attend as many more as I possibily  can.  The idea for the BCFW is still a  good one, but I feel the sense of  direction and purpose developed  initially has been lost. I do not  deny the need for some controls to  ensure that the work of the convention is accomplished, but the  recent convention was the most  restrictive assembly I have ever  attended.  There was fear, almost amounting  to paranoia, on the part of some  members of the standing committee  that certain interest groups  intended irresponsible disruption of  the plenary sessions. To my knowledge there was no intent of this  sort from any group, but this  paranoia resulted in the muzzling  of valid opinions and expressions  from a number of member groups  to the detriment of the credibility  of BCFW's stated intent 'to provide a network of full support for  women's diverse struggles.'  The annual convention of the BCFW  is the only time each year when  a large number of the women of  B.C. are able to meet to exchange  ideas, to generate new energy for  these struggles. This opportunity  must not be wasted again.  Betty Jeffries, Courtenay Women's  Group  I was struck by our ability to  work together as we dealt with  the incredible amount of new policy  that had to be discussed and rehashed before being passed at the  convention.  Yvette Perreault, Chair, Rights  of Lesbians Subcommittee.  Having attended the Action Conference out of which the BCFW  grew, I returned to B.C. two and  a half years later and attended  the policy convention, finding  the federation^ mature and well-  established reality. Several  things impressed me:  1) A traditionally structured  organization had been carefully  established by groups who, for  the most part, consider themselves on the forefront of social  change; 2) To a very large extent  this structure works. A large  amount of policy was discussed  in at least 3 forums and approved  in plenary in a relatively short  amount of time with astoundingly  little cramming, lack of consideration, or running overtime.  More importantly, it worked because almost all the women attending knew or quickly learned how  to use the structure to say what  they wanted.  Some women still  felt alienated by the formalities  and felt as though the structure  was working against them rather  than for them. However, clearly  an enormous amount of education  and skill development had gone  on and, in fact, continued  throughout the conference, with  the result of most women being  fairly comfortable with that  format for discussion and decision making. 3) The structure  seemed to be democratic, and  for the most part, to resolve  confrontations in the arena of  rules of order rather than in  that of the power of personality.  Val Embree, BCFW Vancouver Regional  Rep. '76-77  Plenary, sub-committees, policy,  regional meetings...What is this?  It's alive. And healthy, too.  It's unified energy - women from  all over the province consolidating  our skills and perspectives.  And that strangely familiar woman  up there.  It's my grade four teacher!  She chaired a session of the convention. Wow!  Myra Thomson of Mom's Repairs our foremothers  Johanna den hertog  A MARCH OF THE UNEMPLOYED IN VANCOUVER IN THE 1930's.  Our. historical and social realities  are defined for us by the authors  of our history books. And who writes  the history books? Traditionally,  they have been written by an intellectual elite of educators and professionals. And, as with all  positions of power, who these individuals are is in turn dependent  upon economic, class, sex and ethnic/  racial background. Neither women  nor the non-white nor the poor  have been chosen to write our  history.  History books either exclude these  classes of individuals, or they  include us only in relation to how  well we have played the status quo  roles. In our schools we are taught  to marvel at how our pioneer fore-  mothers washed clothes in freezing  mountain streams, made lye soap,  swept dirt-floor log cabins spotlessly clean, and learned to make  bannock from the Indians.  Our  foremothers were apparently culinary  and domestic geniuses - ie. good  housewives and mothers.  But that is historical bias, the  bias of the ruling class (white,  male and middle class) who see in  history only those events which  support their belief in the inevitability and the absolute Tightness of the present society.  This is not the historical truth,  however. The historical truth  for the women, the poor and the  Native Indians of B.C, is a series  of steps in a long struggle of  trying to halt the development of  our present society, questioning  its Tightness, its inevitability  and fighting for changes towards  equality and justice.  If we throw out the old history  books, and instead sift through  the private journals of our pioneer  foremothers, the old newspapers, the  public archives, and hear the stories  of grandmothers today, we unearth  evidence of women working outside  the home, of women setting up unions,  of women striving for political  power, of women fighting their  second class status, from the  earliest days in the history of  the settlement of B.C.  The 1860s saw the first major influx of white women to B.C., when  single women were shipped from the  'mother' country to the new frontier  as potential wives for the miners  and loggers that were 'conquering'  this new territory; The B.C.  Emigration Society delivered its  first consignment of women in 1862  and successfully saw to it that  within weeks all were married,  beginning their careers of family-  building and thus making permanent  claim to this conquered country.  The next ten years saw little  evidence of any organized activity  by women (they must have learned  all about washing in streams,  making lye soap, etc. during this  time!) ,but as early as the 1870s  institutes and associations of  women started to appear.  The organizations reflected a  growing concern among colonial  women that the needs of women and  children were being seriously ignored in the development of the  new colony.  Women had no legal  rights, nor any economic security  inside or outside the family. Women  were not considered 'persons' in  the interpretation of the BNA Act,  could not vote or hold office municipally, provincially or federally.  Outside the home women could be  employed as domestics or in factories,  but were barred access to educational  institutions,  and from the professions. Women had no rights over  their own children; fathers had  sole licence to determine education  of a child, guardianship, or any  other matters. Women could not  claim any right to property at all  within marriage, and could be  WHAT DID TH€Y FIGHT FOR?  HOW DID TH€Y ORGANIZ€? deserted, or kicked out of the  family home with the husband  suffering few if any legal re-  precussions.  Women's Institutes began dotting  the province in the early 1880s.  They organised women around issues  of education, health, nutrition  and home management, forming the  first mutual support groups of  the many isolated women in the  farming communities. The first  B.C. chapter of the Women's  Christian Temperance Union was  founded in Victoria in 1883 with  the aim of ending the increasing  problems of family break-up and  economic insecurity for women in  the family through prohibition of  the sale and use of alcohol. While  their analysis of the cause of  women's problems was obviously  (and with the aid of hindsight!)  severely limited, the Women's Christian Temperance Union nevertheless 'Ģ  proved to be a powerful force in the  years to come by mobilizing hundreds  of women to take up the cudgel for  the first time in demanding their  long-denied legal and franchise rights,  All over Canada, the phenomena of  the growth of women's societies  was occurring to such an extent  that in 1893 a federation was formed,  called the National Council of Women,  Local chapters were formed across  the nation, and all women's groups  were encouraged to affiliate. Most  smaller organizations did, but rivalry existed between the National  Council and the larger, more religious  based groups like the W.C.T.U. and  the Y.W.C.A. The formation of  this council attempted to bring  women together across religious,  political, regional, and 'social'  lines, thus beginning the process  of the secularization of women's  concerns.  very middle class  & select group  But by no means were the women of  those groups 'radical*. They  basically upheld the values of their  times, were very patriotic, believed  in the inviolability of the family,  and in the 'natural* domestic role  of women. They believed that women  should have a place in politics  and in other sectors of the outside  world due to their potential 'humanizing' influence in the political  arena, and that in our innate  'feminine difference' , we could  play a mitigating role to the  'natural aggressiveness' of men.  The Vancouver Local Council of  Women's choice of issues between  1900 and 1920 gives some indication  of the limited ideological frameworks of the early leaders of the  movement. They trained hundreds  of women in parliamentary procedures, in anticipation of the vote.  They lobbied CPR to put female  matrons on the trains, and were  very concerned about smoke and  noise pollution. The Council at  one point  voted against allowing  Oriental women to come to meetings, and on another occasion  organized to prevent 'Hindu'  women from immigrating, to B.C.  unless it was to join their  husbands. They were also interested in the 'domestic problem',  but from the point of view of the  employers, not the plight of the  poorly paid women themselves.  Undoubtedly, they were a very  middle-class and select group of  women.  Soon the vote became the central  issue. It seemed there could be no  expectation of winning changes in  the legislature and eradicating  the inequities in the law, unless  women got the franchise.  The first petition on the enfranchisement of women was presented in  Victoria in 1885 by the W,C.T.U,  Year after year delegations of women  from all across the province, and  from all the major women's organizations, traveled to the Provincial  Legislature, presenting increasingly  long petitions, but with no success.  The (Conservative) government of  the time refused even to consider  the issue, although between 1884  and 1899 a total of 11 Private  Members' Bills to amend the Elections  Act to include women were introduced in the House (submitted mostly  by the Socialist members). All were  soundly defeated.  In 1903, 'women's rights' were first  included in a political party's  platform. The Provincial Progressive  Party, a rather short-lived coalition  of 51 organizations and parties of  the Left, debated and passed a policy  on women at their convention in  Kamloops.  IN 1910, THE POLITICAL EQUALITY  LEAGUE WAS FORMED IN VANCOUVER  AND VICTORIA.  THIS GROUP HAD  FEW RELIGIOUS ATTACHMENTS, AND  CHAMPIONED THE CAUSE OF THE VOTE  MORE ON THE BASIS OF A RIGHT  THAN ON THE GROUNDS THAT WOMEN  IN POWER WERE NECESSARY TO  "HUMANIZE" POLITICS. THEY  PUBLISHED A PAPER, CALLED  THE CHAMPION, AND MEMBERS  TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE PROVINCE GIVING HUNDREDS OF SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS ON WOMAN'S  SUFFRAGE.  In 1912, 60 women marched to Victoria  with 10,000 signatures demanding  the right to vote for women. The  answer continued to be a resounding  'no'. Premier McBride's rationale  was that. "The home would be  neglected and women would no doubt  sit in parliament when they had  the vote, then form a women's party  and run the affairs of the country."  By 1916, however, the inevitability  of women becoming enfranchised  grew clearer. The Prairie provinces  began extending the vote to women,  In B.C., the long-ruling Conservative  party was facing an election, and  in the hope of shoring up their  fading support, conceded to put  the issue of the women's vote to a  referendum at election time. The  Liberals nonetheless won the election  and the referendum (remember, only  representing the male electorate)  came out overwhelmingly in favour  of women's suffrage (51,892 to  24,606).  it is a struggle in which women  have been engaged, however  limited initially in our analysis,  not for 10, but for 100 years in b-c  WOMEN'S BUILDING IN NEW WESTMINSTER IN THE 1910's  THE WOMEN OF THE 20's WERE TAKEN  ABACK BY THE WAY THEY WERE BEING  LAID OFF IN THOUSANDS AND BEING  FORCED BACK INTO THE HOME, DESPITE  THE GAINS THEY HAD MADE.  IT WAS BEGINNING TO BE OBVIOUS  TO SOME THAT THE "ISSUES" HAD TO  BE TACKLED IN A LARGER SENSE, IN  A WIDER ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL  AND ECONOMIC BASIS OF SOCIETY.  BUT THIS REQUIRED A REVOLUTION OF  THINKING IN THE EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PREVIOUSLY  UNITED MOVEMENT FELL APART OVER  INTERNAL POLITICAL DIFFERENCES.  ON JANUARY 20, 1945, HUNDREDS OF  WOMEN WHO HAD GAINED EMPLOYMENT  DURING THE WAR HELD A CONFERENCE  IN THE HOTEL VANCOUVER CALLED THE  "FUTURE OF WOMEN IN EMPLOYMENT."  MUCH ANGER WAS EXPRESSED AT THE  STANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS  THAT WOMEN WERE ONLY TO BE CONSIDERED A RESERVE LABOUR POOL TO  DRAW ON IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND  THAT WOMEN SHOULD WILLINGLY GIVE  UP THEIR JOBS TO THE RETURNING MEN,  BUT NO AMOUNT OF ANGER PREVENTED  THE MASSIVE LAY-OFFS OF WOMEN, AND  THE RESULTING RETREAT BACK INTO  THE HOME.  On April 5, 1917, an amendment to  the Elections Act was finally passed  in B.C., allowing women to vote and  to hold office. However, not until  1947 were East Indian or Oriental  women granted the same right, and  not until 1952 could Native women  vote.  The very year after B.C.'s passage  of the Elections Amendment Act,  B.C. had its first woman MLA. Mary  Ellen Smith won a by-election in  1918 when her husband died and his  seat fell vacant. She held the seat  through two fur.ther elections, running initially as an Independent  (her husband had been a Liberal).  The next few years saw a fair amount  of woman's legislation and changes  in regulations, indicating that by  now women had achieved a certain  level of success at wielding their  political power. Through the pressure  exerted by the well-organized  Political Equality League, and the  influence of Mary Ellen Smith in  the legislature, three important  bills for women were passed: the  Deserted Wives' Maintenance Act,  the Equal Guardianship of Infants  Act, and the Mothers' Pensions Act.  Smith was also offered the position  of Speaker of the House in 1921,  but she declined, saying that she  could do more in her role as MLA.  The women's organizations of the  early 1900s were also concerned  about issues other than legislative  ones.  birth control  in 1900's  The Political Equality League took  up the issue of birth control.  Members clandestinely went around  the province giving women access  to birth control devices, and  holding discussion groups on the  issues of birth control and sex,  trying to counter the prevailing  attitude that sex was 'dirty'  EVEN IN THE EARLY 1900's,  DAYCARE WAS AN IMPORTANT NEED.  THE FIRST CRECHE IN VANCOUVER  WAS ESTABLISHED ON APRIL 3,  1912, IT WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO  WOMEN WHO WORKED. THE CHARGE WAS  TEN CENTS A DAY FOR ANY CHILD  UNDER SIX.  The early part of the century also  saw a considerable amount of agitation around the fact that women  continued to be barred from the  professions. After much resistance,  the legislature finally passed a  bill in 1912, allowing women to be  admitted to the bar.  Meanwhile, women were beginning  to organize in areas of labour. In  the early 1900s, Jean "Ma" Everet  started organizing labour unions in  the canning industry, where the  majority of the workers were women.  In 1902, women of the Telephone  Operators Auxiliary to the International Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers staged a  three week strike  for union recognition, higher  wages, and better working conditions  - and won. Also in 1902 the first  local of Shirt, Waist and Laundry  workers achieved union recognition.  In 1910 waitresses started to  organize.  In 1913 a Home and  Domestic Employees Union was established for the more than 2000  women who worked in Vancouver as  domestics; unfortunately, the  difficulties of organizing women,  who in their work are isolated from  each other, proved insurmountable  and the union never became strong  enough to be a bargaining unit.  labour  & women  Helena Gutteridge, a strong socialist,  was a prime mover in the early  unionizing of women. She contributed  regularly to the B.C.Federationist,  the paper of the B.C. Federation of  Labour, on issues of women's rights,  organised the successful United  Garment Workers Union of Vancouver,  and with the help of the University  Women's Club, was able to put  enough pressure on the legislature  to have the first Minimum Wage Act  for Girls and Women passed in 1918.  WW1  World War I radically changed the  woman's role in the labour force.  As women were now desperately  needed to replace men who were  going to the front, no one argued  any longer about how women were  innately unable to handle all  these heretofore man's jobs.  Before 1914, bank-tellers, stenographers and elevator operators  were men. After the war, these jobs  were strangely identified as being  woman's xrork.  The four Imperial  Oil gas stations in Vancouver during  the war were run totally by women.  After the war, having achieved the  vote and forayed - briefly - into  the labour market, it now seemed  that the woman's place would surely  be assured in equal partnership  with men in the working world and  in politics.  On the crest of this  atmosphere of success, women across  the country came together to form  the federal Women's Party in 1918,  in hopes of putting women in large  numbers into office.  However, within a year or two it  was obvious that it wasn't going  to be that simple. Women numbering  in the thousands were losing their  jobs now that the men were back,  being told once again that the  country needed them in the home,  that schools could only take a few  women as the openings were needed  for men, and just generally being  pushed aside...'You got the vote,  now don't bother us anymore and go  home.'  The women of the 20s were taken  aback by this turn of events. In  spite of achieving the vote, gaining access to the professions, and  attaining' some protective legislation,  women essentially were still viewed  only as a reserve labour pool, their only proper sphere being considered  the home. It was beginning to be  Obvious to some that the 'issue'  had to be tackled in a larger sense,  in a wider analysis of the political  and economic basis of society, and  women's role in it. But this thinking  required a revolution of thinking in  the existing organizations and the  previously united movement fell  apart over internal political difficulties.  For ten years the movement was  virtually dead.  The thirties were tough on everybody, and especially tough on women.  Thousands of unemployed single women  roamed the streets of Vancouver and  Victoria. All they had to live on  was the dole of $3.10 a week; in  1932, the allotment was down to  $2.80. Hundreds had to turn to  prostitution to survive. Some organizing was done by the Vancouver  Council of Women and the YWCA  to dig up employment for these  women, but with little success.  WV2  The second World War again allowed  all sorts of previously closed  doors to open. From 1940 to 1944,  the work force of women in B.C.  doubled from 30,000 to 60,000.  Over 1000 women were employed building ships at the three yards, on  the Burrard Inlet.  With women flowing back into the  labour force, a few women's organizations began to reappear. Women  started entering the legislature  in greater numbers, and generally  women were again visible in movements for social and political  reform.  In 1941, Nancy Hodges, a Liberal,  was elected to the provincial  Legislature, and became Speaker  of the House in 1949.  In 1943, Lydia Arsens, a Socred,  won a seat in the House, and was the  first proponent of recycling garbage  was a way of conserving resources.  She became a Senator in 1953.

However, she  ended up switching back to the  Socreds and later became the Minister  of Education.  The CCF'ers had the best record,  with three women in the House from  the thirties to the late forties.  Dorothy Steves (1934-45) was very  active in the House as a proponent  of women's rights, fought hard to  get a minimum wage for domestic  workers, and also was known for her  role in bringing credit unions to  B.C, Laura Jamieson (1939-45;  1952-53), an ardent suffragist,was  IFW€AR€  WOM€N,  W€TRAC€  OUR HISTORY  THROUGH OUR!

Outside the legislature the issue  of the consumer became a predominant focus of women during the war.

K MART STRIK€  150 women in Local 725 of the Canadian  Food and Allied Workers are into their  22nd week of strike over their first  union contract with K-Mart in Windsor,  Ontario.  They were subject to changes in their  working hours with no notice, arbitrary  job transfers and firing without due  cause or process.  The Ontario Federation of Labour has  called for a province-wide boycott of  K-Mart and Kresge stores, depending on  the public to show support by not  crossing picket lines while K-Mart is  offering inflation fighter specials to  lure in customers.  The Windsor stores represent only 2  of 3,000 Kresge and K-Mart stores in  North America.  Only one other, in  Sault Ste. Marie, is unionized.  If the women win their battle, this  could well lead into unionization of  other women employed by the chains.  (KR)  Its purpose was to bring protection  for the consumer against war  profiteering on foodstuffs. The  League set up a Consumer Research  Council, and in 1943 began opening  up Consumer Bureaus, In 1947 they  organised a buyer's strike over  exorbitant prices and managed to  cut sales by 25%, resulting in much  reduced prices. Subsequently, there  were many similiarly successful  boycotts in the next few years.  But the war ended, and, of course,  once more the women were told: .  'thank-you very much, but again  we want you back in the house.'  The federal government refused to  hire married women after the war  for many years, and many other  governments and businesses followed  suit with similar hiring policies.  On January 20, 1945, hundreds of  women who had gained employment  during the war "held a conference  in the Hotel Vancouver called the  'Future of Women in Employment.'  Much anger was expressed at the  stance of government and business  that women were only to be considered a reserve labour pool to draw  on in times of crisis, and that  women should willingly give up  their jobs to the returning men.  But no amount of anger prevented  the massive lay-offs of women, and  the resulting retreat of women back  into the home.  1977  A quarter of a century later, with  the beginning of the 'Women's Liberation Movement' in B.C., women  again began fighting the ruling  class definition of women's role  in society, and our second-class  status in labour, in the economy,  in law and in politics. But while  the struggles of the present day  women's movement are evident all  around us, it is a struggle in  which women have been engaged -  however tentatively at times,  and however limited initially in  political analysis - not for 10,  but for 100 years here in the  province of B.C,  LCSBIANS'KIDS  A study conducted by researchers  at UCLA has concluded that young  children of lesbian mothers do not  develop the 'deviant traits' judges  have been warned about in recent  court battles that have often  been settled by depriving lesbian  mothers of the custody of their  children.  The study is the first of its kind  and one that could give defenders  of lesbian mothers some solid psychological evidents to put before  the courts. The study was carried  out by UCLA School of Medicine  associate clinical professor,Martha  Kirkpatrick, UCLA child psychologist Ronald Roy, and UCLA doctoral  candidate in psychology, Katherine  Smith. The results of the study  were published in Human Behavior  magazine.  (The Body Politic and Gay Community  News) PRISONCRS' RIGHTS  BCFW   more convention reactions  The Women Prisoners' and Prisoners'  Family Rights Provisional Subcommittee  of the B.C. Federation of Women is no  more.  The committee, following a long dispute with the BCFW, finally withdrew  from that organization at the BCFW's  convention in Vernon earlier this  month.  It now has a new name—the Prisoners'  Rights Group—and a broader outlook.  Membership is open to anyone willing  to work with the prison movement as a  whole.  The dispute with the BCFW first came  to light at a meeting of the BCFW  standing committee in Prince George  at the end of August.  Committee  chairperson Claire Culhane was criticized for not correctly following  publicity procedures. However, WP  and PFR members were unhappy that Ms.  Culhane was singled out for criticism  at the meeting, rather than being  helped to rectify her errors in procedure at the time they occurred.  The standing committee also proposed  that WP and PFR get around the "publicity problem" by acting as two groups,  one, the subcommittee, and two, as a  member group with more freedom to act.  This was unacceptable to the members,  as it seemed hypocritical. Either we  were willing to take action on issues  in our own name, or nothing.  Members were also disappointed that  no one from the Lesbian Rights Subcommittee had been willing to assist  with the grave problem of the oppression of lesbian women within prisons,  despite repreated requests to do so.  Finally, and most importantly, the  standing committee rejected our name  change from Rights of Women in Prison  to Women Prisoners' and Prisoners'  Family Rights because the term "family"  was too all-embracing since it would  include men.  There was also no recognition of the  fact that because there are 1000 men  in lower mainland prisons versus about  80 women the committee would have to  work on the prison system as a whole  to achieve its goals.  At the Vernon convention, Ms. Culhane's  presentation was limited to an hour,  and no debate was allowed, At the conclusion, it was ruled by a standing  committee member that since WP and PFR  was a provisional subcommittee, it  could not withdraw, and therefore just  simply no longer existed.  As a result, at a November 11th meeting  the name change and broader focus was  decided on. Already the Prisoners'  Rights Group is busy with many projects. First and most important is  the Christmas vigil to be held at the  B.C. Pen and Oakalla from 8 p.m.  Christmas Eve to 8 p.m. Christmas Day  to protest solitary confinement and  lack of visiting rights.  Despite a federal court ruling last  December that solitary was cruel and  unusual punishment, men and women are  still being confined for months and  years on end in small, dank cells.  And relatives of inmates at the B.C.  Pen have been informed that there will  be no visits allowed at Christmas because prisoners are still confined to  the gymnasium as a result of damage  done during the September riot there.  more on the PRISONERS' RIGHTS GROUP...  We need people to do research, write  letters and visit inmates, set up  programs for women at Oakalla, help  with publicity, and much, much more.  Our next meeting will be December 4,  Saturday, at 1 p.m. at 1803 Kitchener  (around the back and up the stairs).  See you there!  Kathryn Hazel, for the Prisoners'  Rights Group  A lot of policy got passed. That  doesn't just happen. It takes a lot  of planning and hard work. The women  that worked so hard to make it come  off deserve a great deal of credit.  There were some potentially divisive  incidents which were handled well.  It says a lot for women in the movement when problems like this can be  handled objectively without a whole  lot of over-reaction.  Joan Rykyta, Women's Bookstore  I thought that the convention was  very well organised, and that the  standing committee did their best  to modify Robert's Rules of Order  to make them bearable. There were  lots of women at the convention who  were coming from diverse political  places. I think that one of the  real strengths of BCFW is that it  allows these groups to-hear each  other.  Marion Barling, from the Women's  Studies Association, and Women in  Focus.  The most disturbing thing was the  way in which the standing committee  chose to handle conflict by not  allowing it to surface fully.  Whether I agreed with those who challenged the standing committee or not,  what they were saying was never  permitted to come out. Opposition  was seen by the standing committee  as being basically a negative act  of needless aggression,  Mary Gillies, of Isis, Women and Media  NOTE WELL : OPINIONS EXPRESSED HERE  ARE THOSE OF INDIVIDUALS, NOT OF THE  GROUPS TO WHICH THEY HAPPEN TO BELONG,  There were a lot of underlying, non-  admitted feelings at the convention,  especially around the prisoners' rights  provisional subcommittee issue.  I found people a lot more politically  aware, in a general sense, than I had  thought they would be. I attended a  workshop on political strategies which  I thought was a very good workshop.  I feel that as a group, BCFW should  support other groups. I feel we  should support, for example, prisoners'  rights groups within the jurisdiction  of our constitution.  Stephanie Crate, Rape Relief.  We have got oceans of policy now,  so we can get into the action which  everybody has been screaming for  over the last two years. I think we  have a tremendous nex^ standing  committee: lots of new blood, lots  of energy. We have three members  from the Oakanagan, two from Prince  George. Now we do have representation  outside the lower mainland, and  this is an important new step, x^hich  inevitably took two to three years  to bring about. We have extensive,  broad policy, and exciting new subcommittees which will enable us to  explore new areas from two, different  perspectives.  The women in prisons committee didn't  have sufficient policy and this is  why they ran into constitutional  hassles. Hopefully, this kind of constitutional problem can be avoided now  that we have new policy.  I would like to see BCFW enter into  action now, and especially I would  like to see us become better known  in the province. That will come from  media recognition when we take action.  Now we have a solid enough base from  which to withstand criticism. The  convention built that concrete base.  We really are a provincial organization. That big step was accomplished at our third convention this  November.

JOHANNA DEN HERTOG  observations of an observer  WHERE ARE WE GOING?  Being a 'writer/researcher' and not  primarily an 'activist'at present,  I went to the third annual BCFW  convention this time as a 'registered observer'.  There were quite a number of us  observers, and there were certainly  a few of us who had a hard time  sitting on our hands and keeping our  mouths shut, judging by the number  of times there were votes in workshops and even several times in  plenary to allow words from an  'observer' ... myself upon occasion as well.  But mostly I observed.  Through the hours and hours of convention, from Friday night seemingly  non-stop through to late Sunday afternoon my observations piled up in  the form of countless pages of notes  which attempted to keep track of the  hundreds of resolutions being passed,  while my thoughts and feelings about  the whole affair, seemingly without  explanation, went from positive  expectancy to profound questioning  about whether we really are on the  right track after all with this  federation of ours, and this superficially successful conventioneering.  And now, in the intervening days  since the convention, in doing the  various 'post-mortems' we all are so  apt to do, I am still personally  without answers and in a state of  contradiction.  I do knox? that my  questioning is not general to many  of us who went, but on the other  hand, there are others who, too,  seem to have experienced this last  convention as somewhat troubling.  But I have become confirmed in one  opinion — that while the convention  may have been a success in terms of  achieving its stated objective of  establishing a strong policy base on  a province-wide level for the Federation, the more fundamental questions of why we have a federation,  and what we are going to do with it,  when and how have not begun to be  answered.  I am painfully aware though of the  dangers inherent in 'contemplating  one's navel' or analyzing things to  their death: we can easily become  directed inward, analyzing always  ourselves rather than the outside  world and system, and in so doing  divert energies from action and organizing and constructive work to  contemplation, discussion and non-  ending self-criticism ... which  often unfortunately contributes to  feelings of malaise, disillusionment  and anomie.  Nevertheless, here and there we must  take stock, or we shall fall prey to  the other and greater danger inherent  in any movement: without being  aware of it, in the midst of all our  organizing and working and convening  we slowly and imperceptibly become  irrelevant, ineffective and less and  less of a radical challenge that  demands 'fundamental change'.  As we institutionalize ourselves in  groups, networks, federations we always run the risk that instead of  coordinating our actions and consolidating our 'revolutionary forces'  to produce greater power xvhen we  make our demands, we end up dissipating our energies into keeping our  structures and communication networks working, needing to worry more  and more about how we can keep ourselves going, and going well ( ...  and even better!) and less and less  having time to devote to making those  significant challenges to that  oppressive sexist, racist,  capitalist, etc.  system that has caused  our existence in the first place.  And that is what began to worry me  through this last convention.  On the surface, BCFW especially  after this last convention is strong  and continuing to grow.  From its  rather chaotic and divided origins  three years ago, it has become a  true provincial body now, its constitution probably a model that few federations have achieved in terms of  its guarantees of democracy and.  representation of member groups.  In  contrast to last year, we now have a  healthy number of member groups,  pretty good policy on almost every  matter of concern in our B.C. women's  movement and at least 7 subcommittees  on various matters of provincial  interest.  We are indeed more able  to communicate across the 'barriers'  of the familiar rural/urban, gay/  straight, old/young and lifestyle  splits.  While this year's convention was not conflict-free —we had  a challenge to the old BCFW executive and the course of BCFW's actions  from one member group which went  largely unresolved; we had divergent  opinions arising from the report of  the now-departed Women Prisoners  Subcommittee, and we have clear  splits on the issue of whether BCFW  (or even any group in the movement)  is well-served by government funding — on the whole everything ran  well and the business got done.  So the business got done.  Are we  really any further ahead than we  were before?  Where is the action?? When are we  finally going to have time to  organize that?! Well, yes, we all  know that action is ultimately the  responsibility of the member groups,  not the federation executive. But,  if we are not careful, it is not  hard to imagine that somehow another  year may go by without any significant  provincial actions on behalf of  the whole federation. This is already  the third annual convention, and we  leave it with no sense of how,as  a coordinated number of groups  in the province, we are going to act  this year. Alone, as every other year?  Or on an ad hoc basis, like Women Rally  for Action last year?  The assumption seems to be now (in  contrast to a few years ago) that we  have all the time in the world...  and thus can afford to organise  into this federation in a log  ical and year by year building  way.  I wonder. This year  alone, 1/3 of B.C.'s women's  groups, if not more, have had  to fold, and almost everyone  has had to cut back. What will  happen next March 31?  Secondly, from a historical perspective, it's very dangerous,  it seems to me, to evaluate the  strength of what is happening in  a movement, by the strength of  its structures.      *  The women's movement that began  in B.C. in the late 1800's and  was very active for almost thirty years did "die." It is,  first of all, not all that easy  to analyze why that happened,  although we suspect that it was  due largely to the limited pol-  iticial analysis of most of  the groups of the time, and that  with the achievement of the franchise, and (for the time) the  rather momentous changes in legislation and regulations affecting the rights of women in law,  education, and labour, the work,  in a sense, seemed done.  But,  you know, it's only with hindsight that we now can establish  that it, in fact, died, and  more or less point to the '20s  as the time of that death.  The women of the time did  not see it as over. Many groups  continued in form and in structure and with superficially  many of the old actions, for many  years. The Women's Christian  Temperance Union still exists,  still has meetings, and perhaps  even conventions. The huge, and  once so powerful National Council  of Women and all the Provincial  Councils and the Local Councils  also exist...have great constitutions, annual conventions, and  meet internationally.  But for  all their good motivations and  all their delegates and conventions in the many intervening  years, where can we point to  their effect?  Federations, or conventions, or  even excellent radical policy  do NOT a movement make.  Theoretically, there is, of course,  everything to be gained from a  federation such as ours; but it  seems that unless somehow we  all shift gears pretty quickly  and start back on that road of  being seriously radical, with  visible and daring and powerful  actions that challenge those  institutions that day in and  day out continue to quite  effectively oppress us as women,  our federation and even we  member groups that make it up  seem quite definitely to be on  a course of letting ourselves  exist rather comfortably in  structures but letting the  "movement" quite imperceptibly  slip out of our hands to an  unnoticed death,  I know that we are not in any  way "the chosen" (!) and so  what has happened all over the  world hundreds of times over to  essentially radical movements  can happen to us too, if we are  not somehow more vigilant than  our predecessors.

Dodie Zerr, President of the bank  workers' local reports that this is  the first branch of the Toronto  Dominion bank to apply for union  certification. Along with the Main  Branch of the Bank of Montreal in  Port Alberni, whose application was  also processed this week, the union  has now applied for certification  for fourteen bank branches. These  include branches of the Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank  of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia  and now the Toronto Dominion,  Ms.Zerr said the union is looking  forward to the publication of the  Banks' annual reports. Their fiscal  year ended on October 31st. She  said that 1976 will undoubtedly  be the most profitable year in the  history of Canadian banking,  "Still, bank workers, and especially the women who make up three  quarters of the workers in the  branches are among the lowest paid  workers in Canada," she said.  Ms.Zerr also pointed out that the  $100.00 a year wage increase recently given to Commerce employees  in the Pacific region is "an  increase of less than two dollars  a week, (which) does little to  improve our living standards."

Early in the new year, SORWUC faces  a decision by the Labour Relations  Board on what constitutes an  appropriate bargaining unit.

ONCTHIRDOFGNP  Work being performed in the home by  this country's housewives is equal  in value to one third of the gross  national product.  An economist at Queen's university  estimates the value of work done  by housewives at $120 a week per  housewife. This figure was arrived  at by using the wages paid to women  who perform equal work in comparable  jobs.  Based on the GNP figure for August  of $182.9 billion, housewives  contributed $60 billion in work.  UNIONS  THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN UNIONS was  the subject of a seminar held recently in Prince Rupert and Terrace  as part of a series 6f workshops  sponsored by the Northwest Commu-  ity College labour studies program.  Women attended from various unions  including Operating Engineers,  Rock and Tunnel, Bartenders, PPWC,  UFAWU, Postal Workers, Hospital  Workers, B,C,Govt,Employees, and  ihoreworkers. A number of resource  persons were on hand, including  Gail Borst, women's organizer for  the BC Federation of Labour, and  John Jensen, coordinator of the  college program.  Subjects discussed were the history  of the participation of women in  unions and the reasons for their  involvement, and matters particularly pertinent to women such as the  drafting of those parts of contracts  concerned with pregnancy and mater-  nith leave. The unionists compared  the stand of various unions towards  women's issues, commenting on how  a simple change (for instance,  providing childminding services  during union meetings) can make  all the difference to women in the  labour force.  Concern was expressed over the  "Right to Work" legislation, a policy  proposal that was rejected by the  recent Social Credit convention.  Participants pointed out that a more  appropriate term would be, "Right  to Scab" legislation.  In discussing the recent Day of  Protest, there were comments on its  educational value, particularly for  those for whom it had been their  first political action.  Northern Times 10/11/76  AIB&PRICCS  The government's experiment in wage  and price controls has been an expensive exercise that has to date  produced few tangible benefits to  consumers, according to Ruth Lotzkar,  president of the Consumer's Assoc,  of Canada.  In a statement following a meeting  of the CAC board of directors, the  CAC president said her association  does not credit the AIB with the *  recent decline in the growth of the  Consumer Price Index because the  decreases were solely accountable  to food prices, which are not  subject to controls.  Meanwhile, she said, the CAC has  received many complaints about the  rising cost of housing, energy,  transportation and government  services, such as the post office,  education, day care, and about the  cost of the AIB itself. (Upstream)  CHILDRCN  More than 72 years passed before a  commission was appointed to recommend revisions to the 1903 Protection of Children's Act, and it could  be many more years before the proposals find their way to the courtroom.  David Cruickshank, former UBC law  professor and research director for  B.C.'s Royal Commission on Family and  Children's J^aw, said the commission's  fifth report, Children's Rights, is  no closer to becoming law than when  it was submitted to the Social Credit  government over a year ago.  Speaking to a group of parents, teachers and childcare workers at the  second annual conference of the Canadian Association for Young Children,  Cruickshank appeared deeply concerned  as he told the audience that he is  still awaiting word ("even a no, although disappointing, would be better  than this silence.") from the provincial government.  He said until there is a change in  the antiquated legislation children  remain an underprivileged and neglected group in Canadian society.  They have no rights in the legal  sense, he said.  Their legal position  is non-existent.  from  CHILDREN'S RIGHTS SEEN NOT HEARD  by Joey Thompson  THE PROVINCE  AFFIRMATIVC ACTION  The Vancouver Resources Board's  Affirmative Action Committee has  completed its interim report. The  greatest part of the report deals  with analysis of the sex ratio of  VRB staff in various classifications  and at various salary levels. It  reveals that fully one third  of female employees earned less  than $10,000 in 1975, compared to  only 10.3 of the males. Men make  an average of almost $500 a year  more than women in all job classifications.  Contributing to this  imbalance is the fact that a  large number of women are in the  Clerical and Housekeeping jobs  which are almost completely  segregated by sex, and which have  the lowest pay scales in the.  system. The report also indicated  an imbalance on the VRB staff of  handicapped persons, Native Indians,  and members of racial minority  groups. For example, there are less  than 1% Native Indians on staff,  compared with 5% in the population  of Vancouver.  Meanwhile, what has happened to the  committee approved by City Hall in  July '75 to plan and implement an  Affirmative Action program? A whole  lot of nothing. Demand of the newly  elected alderpersons that they make  the resurrection of that committee  an immediate priority. fraser valley  coalition  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE WOMEN'S  MOVEMENT  One of the most exciting experiences  happening within the Women's Movement  in the lower mainland is the development of the Fraser Valley Women's  Coalition.  It is a collective council  made up of individual women and representatives of Women's Centres in the  Valley. Meetings are held monthly,  on a women's centre rotation basis,  to discuss issues of regional and  provincial importance.  The Coalition was formed during the  fall of 1975 out of the need to overcome the alienation felt between  women's centres. Due to the large  geographical area we live in more  contact and better communication was  imperative. The original members  were BCFW regional representative  and four Women's Centre reps: Ishtar  (Langley, Aldergrove, Abbotsford),  Fronya Women's Centre (Mission),  Maple Ridge Women's Centre, and  PoCo Women's Centre (Port Coquitlam).  Presently, three more groups have  joined: The Rural Lesbians Group  (Langley-based), Richmond Women's  Centre, and Delta Women's Centre.  Women working in social service  areas - Public Health Centre, Department of Recreation, Community Colleges  - also participate, thus enabling  the Coalition to give support to  individual feminists, while at the  same time achieving a broad representation of the communities and a  qualitative sharing of information  and ideas.  A unified funding proposal was submitted to, and approved by, the  Secretary of State this past summer.  Under this grant, we have been able  to hire a Coordinator, meet basic  operational costs and provide maintenance money for each of the four  centres involved at the time of the  proposal. This unified funding has  been a rewarding breakthrough because: a) the centres worked together  to ensure their continued existence,  b) it eliminated the necessity of  competition between women's groups,  and c) it examined the existing  services for women on a regional  level and clarified further directions for overall development.  The Coalition does not have a policy  as such but we are a member group of  the B.C. Federation of Women, thereby agreeing to its constitution.  Besides providing the centres with  maintenance funds, our objectives are:  1) to develop shared programs such as  volunteer counselling training  2) to research and compile a comprehensive collection of women's resource material available in the  Valley to be used for education  and organizing purposes  3) to research the idea of Valley-wide  services that would be too costly  and impractical for one community  to undertake but which could function well on a regional basis, i.e.  Rape Relief Service with trained  Sisters  volunteers in each community tied  into a central switchboard.  4) to encourage the growth of the  Women's Movement by providing support and advice for individual  women and struggling groups and  financial help when possible  5) to provide a Regional Advisory  Body and a strong political voice.  As a Coalition we represent the  whole Valley and will work with  and offer recommendations to other  bodies such as the Fraser Valley  Regional Colleges, the Department  of Human Resources, etc.  The Coalition has functioned very  well from the beginning, with all of  us working cooperatively for the good  of our centres and the regional  Women's Movement.  It has proved to  be a very positive, supportive body  to those involved.  One year ago,  feminists from Richmond to Mission  had literally no contact with each  other and no knowledge of common  problems, interests and successes.  The Coalition has provided the means  for us to bridge that gap and develop close ties. An example of this  richmond  is that when the Richmond Women's  Centre needed money, the PoCo Women's  Centre, in a position to do so, gave  Richmond financial aid.  And when  the Ishtar Women's Collective, although successfully maintaining the  Transition House, had to close its  Abbotsford Women's Resource Centre  due to staff shortage, the sisterly  support needed and the vehicle by  which Ishtar women could continue  community programs was supplied by  the Coalition.  Future possibilities of the Coalition  are mind-boggling. One immediate  outcome might be a joint newsletter,  shared by all Centres or a few. This  would eliminate duplication of time  and energy of those Centres already  producing a monthly newsletter or  provide newsletters in areas where  none now exist. Whatever endeavors.,  the Coalition initiates, they can  only firm up the unity, the solidarity and the strength of the Fraser  Valley Women's Movement. Regional  councils could certainly evolve  wherever necessary, bringing together isolated feminists all over British Columbia.  The Fraser Valley Women's Coalition  is the first such council and it  should not be the last.  - sisters  In April 1976 I noticed a very brief  article in the Richmond Review calling interested women together to  discuss and plan the formation of a  Women's Resource Centre in Richmond.  Having been involved in a local CR  group which had reached the point of  talking about wishing to DO something  I felt impelled to attend this meeting.  So were some 50 other women,  and from this inaugural meeting called  by Doreen Steiner at Douglas College  on April 21, 1976 we have now grown  to a functioning Centre open twice a  week and presenting quite a variety  of programs and services to Richmond  women.  Following that initial meeting, further general meetings were held, a  steering committee was formed with  rotating positions, and the aims and  goals of our new Resource Centre were  drawn up, to form the basis for our  planning and projected activities...  we envisage, encouraging  the formation of many different types  of groups and activities such as CR  groups, information and referral services, drop-ih facilities for women  with and without children, skill  courses, career counselling, direct  action groups, e.g. dealing with  education and sexism...among other  activities."  Our Resource Centre actually opened  on July 7, 1976 with an Open House  attended by many Resource People  representing local organizations and  agencies and this drew a large number of interested local women. Since  then the steady numbers of women  dropping in and/or attending our.  formal and informal programs have  really confirmed the need in our community for a Women's Centre such as  this.  Basically, the RWRC is able to open  twice a week - Tuesdays 1-4 pm and  Wednesday evenings 7-10 pm.  In addition to this, we maintained a formal program every second Wednesday  evening through the summer which included a car maintenance workshop,  introductions to Assertiveness Training and the CR group, a session on  Returning to Learning and an evening  workshop presenting the Dreikurs  philosophy of parenting. We held a  most successful all-day Assertiveness  Training Workshop.  All these events  were fully covered by our local press  even to the extent of a large photo  on the front page of the Richmond  Review.  This fall we are finding that the  initial honeymoon euphoria is waning  and that local organizations and public media which were blazing us across their newsletters have "grown  accustomed to our face" and we have  been faced with a time of consolidation, some introspection and lots of  pure hard work. We have had to hash  out our priorities shelving some exciting looking projects for "next  year" when we have more time (oh yes!)  and experience.  Our fall program  has however, still been very successful, running an 8-week introductory  series "Women Together" on Wednesday nights and holding informal discussion groups around a topic on alternate Tuesdays.  We started the fall season with a  publicity blitz which included setting up an information table in the  Richmond Mall for several days and  mailing out our brochures with all  the welfare cheques in early September. And local women are responding.  Richmond is a very middle-class conservative suburb and we feel we have  to recognize this trying to present  ourselves and the RWRC as feminist  in orientation without alienating  just those women x^ho can most benefit from involving themselves in our  Centre.  This is not always easy to achieve  without a sense of self-compromise.  It has therefore become very sustaining to many of us on the so-called  steering committee that we have become affiliated with the Fraser Valley  Women's Coalition and the BCFW.  We are now planning for the New Year.  Our first newsletter is in the process of being edited and we really  would welcome input from other women's  groups and individuals.  After all this I really would like  to invite any women in the Richmond  area (or anywhere else for that matter) to contact us - become-  really involved, or just drop  in occasionally, as you like.  Personally, I have found my  eight months active involvement in this Centre and through  it, in the women's movement  to have been a vital experience for me...sometimes exhausting and frustrating, but overall  incredibly exciting, fulfilling  and satisfying as I have on my  own part assumed involvement  anH responsibility in our group  and in the community.

Mayor Angus Davis of Fraser Lake  spoke strongly in favour of giving  financial aid to the Fraser Lake  Women's Centre at a council meeting  last week. Omineca Social Credit  MLA Jack Kempf has suggested that  the village give a grant of $1848  to the Centre.  Kempf has presented a proposal to  provincial secretary Grace McCarthy  that the province give a grant  of $5,000 toward the operation of  the Centre.  In speaking to the council, Davis  said that he is a strong advocate  of the work being done by the  Women's Centre.'Äû.  When asked why the Fraser Lake  Centre was still in operation  when many women's centres have been  forced to close their doors, the  jworking sponsor, Emily  ¬∞>Pacholuk, said that the  centre makes a wide  variety of services  available to every person in the village.

The Ta'aiku/Women Centre has received  a LIP grant of $25,000 to open a women's  centre serving the native and xvhite  women of Burns Lake. The project, which  began November 1st, will employ five  full-time workers.  The two main objectives of the project  are to open the lines of communication .  between native and white women in Burns  Lake and to become self-suppcrting.  The project hopes to achieve the first  objective by having native and white  workers sponsor informal language classes,  and by holding workshops on native land  claims.  In connection with working towards the  second objective - self-sufficiency -  the workers plan to set up their own  small business, with all profits going  towards the operating cost of the centre.  The women can be contacted at the  following address: Ta'aiku/Women Centre,  Box 1076, Burns Lake, B.C.  The word, "Ta'aiku" means Carrier for  a group of women.

During this sitting  we will report to you monthly in  Kinesis on what the Members of Parliament (MPs) said about women's issues  as recorded in Hansard, the official  records of the federal government  debates.  If you wish to have your own copies  of Hansard ($3.00), Bills and Acts  ($10.00), and/or Votes and Proceedings ($1.00), you can order them from  the Printing and Publishing Department of Supply and Services Canada,  Ottawa, Ontario. A list of MPs, Cabinet Ministers and Parliamentary  Committees appears in Hansard each  week.  Hansard is a very useful lobbying,  educational and communications tool  for feminists interested in politics.  By reading it daily we can respond  immediately to MPs comments or lack  thereof on women's issues.  It is  important to let them know we are indeed monitoring their actions and  statements about women's rights and  that there is such a thing as the  women's vote.  But day after day can go by with no  mention of women's issues in Parliament .  This can be changed if only feminists  will continually press MPs to discuss  women's issues.  We should be writing  letters to our own MPs regularly prodding them to raise the issues and  thanking them when they do.  It encourages them to do it more often.  Parliamentary procedure is slow on  women's issues if only because they  are so seldom discussed.  It is up  to feminists to educate MPs.  The  onus is on us to do the communicating, whether we like it or not.  Ideally, it should be different.  It is not enough for us to keep complaining among ourselves that the  government is not acting fast enough  and to keep calling them idiots.  This changes nothing.  i<7e must reach out to them at every  possible moment by voicing our views  on the issues and sending them consciousness-raising materials frequently.  Letter lobbying is one  means of combatting our own sense  of frustration and doing something  positive at the same time.  So when  we ask VSW members to write a letter  to an MP or an MLA or a Cabinet  Minister, we mean it.  One letter from a voter is estimated  to represent 100 people who felt the  same but never bothered to write.  There are a number of issues in this  article which MPs should be written  to about.  Address all letters to MPs at the  House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.  Ministers are addressed as "The Honourable...". No postage is necessary  when the House is in session. Just  put "O.H.M.S." (On Her Majesty's  Service) where the stamps/normally go.  DAYCARE  On October 14, 1976 MP Iona  Campagnolo of BC noted that daycare is no longer seen as a welfare  service for the poor and that  the newly proposed federal daycare legislation would increase  the number of families eligible  for reimbursement of fees.  On October 19, 1976 MP  Aideen Nicholson of Ontario  said that the federal government had recognized daycare as  the single highest expense of  working parents by doubling  income tax deductions for daycare. Then she noted that the new  measures proposed by the federal  government would increase the  availability of partial subsidies. Nicholson also advised  that the federal government  would be encouraging the provinces to adopt a new system of  income related daycare fees.  Ms. Nicholson quoted the following  daycare related figures: from  1971 to 1974 the number of daycare centres doubled while the  number of spaces tripled. However, she noted that in 1974  fewer than 3% of children under  3 years of age, and less than  9% of children aged 3 to 5  with working parents, attended  daycare. Alternate, inadequate  daycare by relatives and neighbours accounted for 4/5 of all  daycare, she said. Write to  her and thank her for bringing  this issue of urgent concern to  the House.  MORGENTALER  On November 2, 1976 MP  Stu Leggatt of BC asked the  Federal Minister of Justice if  he would pressure the provincial Attorney-General of Quebec  to stop harrassment of Dr.  Morgentaler , who has been  acquitted of charges of illegal  abortion three times and yet  faces numerous similar charges.  The Honourable Ron Basford,  replied "any intervention by me  would be contrary... under the  Criminal Code... as would be  any intervention by the province of Quebec with regard to  the excercise of my jurisdiction."  Write to the Attorney General  of Quebec at parliament in Quebec  City, demanding that he drop the  charges against Morgentaler.  CHILD ABUSE  On October 18, MP Bob Brisco  of BC said he hoped the federal  government would coordinate a  system of recording child abuse  across the country so that  chronic child-abusers could not  escape the law by moving to another province. He was a member  of the parliamentary committee  on child abuse which reviewed  the problem. Write to Mr. Brisco  urging him to raise the issue again.  PRIVATE MEMBERS' BILLS  A private member's bill seldom gets  past first reading in the House of  Commons.  Its main purpose is to raise  an issue for discussion and to gain  some public support (in the form of  letters from you) for later action.  Sometimes a bill will receive second  and third reading, then be referred  to "committee" and come back to Parliament for "royal assent" at which  point if it is passed it becomes law.  During this course of events, amendments may have been made to the bill.  If it is not passed or if it is not  given second or third reading, it  dies on the order paper".  Letters to MPs should be timed to  these crucial points in the life of  the bill. They should be sent each  time it is brought up for discussion  in the House, in order to help pressure it through for passage. Yes,  that means you may have to write your  MP four or five times, if the bill is  really important to you.  A number of private members' bills  have been introduced in the House of  Commons this session that pertain to  the status of women. Pick the ones  that you are most concerned about and  write to your MP about them.  Bill //C-203: Inter-provincial enforcement of alimony/maintenance orders;  introduced by MP Huntingdon, B.C,  Bill #C-210: On obscenity;  introduced by MP Whiteway, Manitoba.  Bill #C-221: On abduction of children;  introduced by MP Friesen of B,C"  Bill //C-224: On divorce; introduced  by MP Brewin, Ontario.  Bill #C-296:  CPP for housewives,  introduced by MP Saltsman, Ont,  Bill //C-318:  Broadcasting children's ads;  MP McGrath, NFLD.  Bill #C-323: On pornography;  introduced by MP Robinson, Ont,  Bill #C-324: On age discrimination; MP Reynolds, B,C»  Bill #C-327: On abortion; introduced by MP Oberle, B.C.  Bill #C-330: On abortion; introduced by MP Roche, Alta.  Bill #C-347: National plebiscite  to remove abortion from criminal code; MP Reynolds, B.C.  Bill #C-229: Sex and violence in  broadcasting; introduced by MP  McGrath, NFLD. '  •  Bill //C-237: On citizenship; introduced by MP Benjamin, Sask.  Bill #C-270: On abortion; introduced by MP Robinson, Ont.  You will note that 4 of the  private members' bills were  introduced by MPs from this  province and there are 4 on  abortion. SOM€ HON. M€MB€RS  CPP FOR HOUSEWIVES  On October 13, 1976 MP  Ursula Appolloni of Ontario  asked if the federal government  would finally recognize housewives under the CPP during  this session of the House. The  Honourable Marc Lalonde, Minister  of Health and Welfare/Minister  Responsible for the Status of  Women did not confirm when  this would happen.  On October 29, 1976 MP  Lincoln Alexander of Ontario  asked if Mr. Lalonde would  abandon the new amendments to  the CPP plan since the Ontario  Status of Women Council had  objected to the amendments  which would effectively  subsidize working women while  homemakers would receive less  benefits. Mr. Lalonde replied  Mr. Alexander was mistaked and  he hoped the OSWC would change  its mind.  On October 14, 1976 MP Iona  Campagnolo of BC noted that the  new amendments to the CPP, if  passed, would ensure that children of the homemaker would be  protected in case of her death  and the homemaker would also be  protected under the CPP against  disability, aside from pension  benefits.  She advised that under the new  amendments, the woman who drops  out of the labour force to raise  children will not be penalized  for that period of low or zero  earnings in calculating her benefits under the CPP,  PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS  On November 3, 1976 MP  Stanley Knowles of Winnipeg  asked the House to urge the  federal government to amend the  Old Age Security Act to provide  pension benefits to widows,  spinsters, (widowers and bachelors, too) between the ages of  60 and 65, who are not working.  The motion was defeated.  On October 23, MP Jack  Marshall of Newfoundland asked  the Minister of Veterans Affairs  when he would introduce an amendment to the Pension Act to get  100% coverage for widows of veterans  who were covered for 48% or less.  On October 26, MP Stanley  Knowles urged the House to  review all federal employee  pensions to provide that all  widows or widowers will not  receive less than 70% of the  contributor's pension and that  the eventual goal would be 100%  for either survivor.  The  motion was seconded by MP  Douglas of BC but was defeated  by the House. Write to your MP  urging him/her to support both  of Mr. Knowles motions next  time it is brought up.  DIVORCE  If bill C-203 is passed, the  federal government would establish a central agency to  enforce the payment of alimony  and maintenance orders across  the country. However', this is  only the first step to improving  the status of divorced dependent  women.  MP Ron Huntingdon of BC introduced the bill with the hope that  later action would be taken  by the federal government to  ensure automatic and guaranteed  payment of alimony and maintenance  and that the federal government  would collect such payments  from defaulting spouses on behalf  of the wife.  Then wives dependent on alimony  and maintenance would not have to  go through the costly process  of searching for delinquent  husbands and suing them in  court for the payment of money  already owed.  All VSW members are urged to  write a letter to the Minister  of Justice, Ron Basford, (carbon  copy to your own MP and to VSW)  urging him to support speedy  passage of this bill.  Campagnolo further noted that  Quebec intends to introduce  identical legislation at the  provincial level to enhance  universality and portability of  social insurance. We don't  have such a scheme here in B.C.  On October 14 and October  25, MP Stanley Knowles of Manitoba, criticized 'the new CPP  amendments for housewives,  arguing that homemakers  would only benefit from it at  divorce or death and that they  would not receive the same benefits  as working women. He asked  permission to introduce a  motion to provide that pensions  for homemakers to be equal to those  of women who work in the labour force.  The other MPs voted him down.  Write to your MP and ask him/  her to support it next time.  On October 20, 1976, MP  Woolliams (that's right) of  Alberta, advised the federal  government to set up family  courts to take divorce and  property settlements out of the  regular courts and to increase  the number of judges to take  care of the backlog cases.  On October 25, 1976 The  Honourable Ron Basford, Minister  of Justice said that during  his meeting with the provincial  Attorneys-General in June this  year in Vancouver, the provinces  Qm insisted matrimonial property  was under their jursictition.  He noted that if the provinces  don't do something about it soon,  the federal government will be  under a lot of pressure to enact  the proposal of the federal Law  Reform Commission on matrimonial  property and housewives pensions.  He indicated he would negotiate  with the provinces for establishment of a unified family court  but did not say when.  FEDERAL HUMAN RIGHTS  On October 25, 1976 The  Honourable Ron Basford, Minister of Justice/MP Vancouver,  in debating the throne speech  said he regetted that the newly proposed federal human  rights bill had not been passed  yet.  However, it gave him more  time to meet with XTOmen's groups  to consult on amendments.  As a result he said he will  introduce a greatly improved  human rights bill to prohibit  discrimination on grounds of  race, national or ethnic origin,  colour, religion, sex, age,  marital status as well as  physically handicapped.  He  did not, however, say when he  would do so.  Mr. Basford noted he is now  convinced that "equal pay for  equal work" is not adequate  as a legal clause to protect  working women arguing that  since most of us are in job  ghettos where no men work, we  cannot claim equal pay.  Thus he has decided to adopt  the definition of "equal pay  for work of equal value" as  proposed by the International  Labour Organization and he  said this would be a "milestone" in the commitment of  the Canadian government, to  women's rights,  Basford also said women's  groups could congratulate  themselves for this change and  advised us to press the government  now, to pass this bill speedily.  However, VSW still has some  criticisms of the new bill.  See the next issue of Kinesis  for our critique.

BOOKS    &<&&tfo$l£  KIDS READ TOO  LIBRARY REPORT  43 requests for reference library  information on the status of women's  issues were received during October.  A majority of them were made by  high school and college students  at the local schools and universities,  but some came from as far afield  as Toronto, and London, Ontario.  The rest were mainly requests from  women's groups in Prince George,  Washington D.C, Winnipeg, Trail  and Quebec and elsewhere. Requests  from legislative libraries in Victoria and Ottawa are on the increase,  too.  Although we have only a small collection of paperbacks, there is a rush  demand on our lending library.  Over 40 paperbacks were lent out  last month.In addition, there were  32 requests for VSW publications in  the same period.

Burch, Robert. The Jolly Witch  New York, E.P.Dutton and Co.,1975.  Illustrator: Leigh Grant,  Witches are always popular with  children, and the Jolly Witch should  be no exception, Cluny is not really  a fully-fledged witch, and the others  have serious doubts about her ability  to become one, because she insists  on being jolly. Finally, they decide  she is untrainable and trade her off  as a peddler, allowing her to take  only 01' Blue, the broom with a mind  of its own. The peddler in turn  delivers her to a cross old woman  and her sad son. Cluny, with her  cheerful ways and sense of humour,  proceeds to discrupt life in the  household, and many amusing incidents  ensue. The sketches are perfectly  suited to the mood of the story, and  I recommend it highly to seven year  olds.  2. Fanshaw, Elizabeth. Rachel.  London, The Bodley Head, 1975.  Illustrator : Michael Charlton.  Rachel is a child with a handicap  which confines her to a wheelchair.  This picture book, which a primary  grade student can easily read, deals  in a matter-of-fact way with Rachel's  problems and with her capabilities.  The story is simple and the illustrations are clear. The message,  directed at small children, is that  with a little cooperation from family and friends, handicapped people  can.participate in many activities.  3. Sen, Felicity. My Family.

Maudie's Umbrella.  New York, E.P. Dutton and Co. Inc.  1975. Illustrator Kay Chorao.  Maudie is a mole and is thus an unusual heroine for a picture book.  Typical of moles, her eyesight is  poor, so Maudie's story concerns her  problems in her search for her missing umbrella. Maudie herself is a  lovable enough character, but the  plot, though simple, does not really  develop to the satisfaction of the  small child. The illustrations are  in pencil and are very carefully  drawn, but a little too grey for the  tastes of small children.  5. Storr, Catherine. Lucy and Lucy  Runs Away. London, The Bodley Head.  1961 and 1962. Illustrator Dick Hart.  (1975 edition)  "Lucy wanted to be a boy." Thus,  the first sentence of the story, Lucy  ruins what could be an entertaining  detective story for young readers.  The premise that to be a brave and  resourceful detective one must first  be male is reinforced many times  throughout Lucy's adventure, in which  she catches a band of thieves.  In  the end, she is accepted "as one of  the boys" because she has done courageous things no girl could ever do.  In the second story of this volume,  Lucy Runs Away, our heroine becomes  "the mysterious outlaw" and runs away  from home to seek adventure.  Once  again, Lucy refers to herself as "he"  whenever she is doing anything bold  or brave.  Even though the new edition boasts a 1975 cover, the stories  were originally published in 1961 and  1962, and both suffer from an outdated  outlook on sex role stereotyping.  Lucy is an imaginative girl, but it  is a shame she (and the author) feel  only boys can have adventures.  THE RAPE OF CHILDREN'S MINDS is a  report prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee Regarding the Status of Women, a  group appointed by the North York  Board of Education.  Their report on  school readers for grades 1, 2 and 3  described the books as "sexist, racist  and full of stereotypes."

M€DIAAOQN  September 24, 1976  Minister of Consumer Services  Legislative Buildings  Victoria, B.C.  Dear Mr. Mair:  Re: SEXISM IN ADVERTISING  Thank you for sending V.S.W. a copy  of the new first edition of GENERAL  ADVERTISING GUIDELINES.  They seem  meticulous in every aspect with one  glaring omission. They do not propose restrictions on sexism in advertising, which is a very serious  problem in our society today.  Are you aware that the chairman of  the B.C. Human Rights Branch has  ruled that sexism in advertising is  contrary to the spirit of the B.C.  Human Rights Code, although it does  not violate the letter of the law?  Did you know that the Canadian Advertising Standards Council will be  publishing guidelines to prevent  sexism in advertising from appearing  in print and broadcasts?  The National Advertising Review Board  of the United States has already published guidelines against sexism in  advertising nationally, during International Women's Year.  In addition, the Ontario Status of  Women Council, under Provincial Secretary in that province, determined  through their survey, that a majority  of female consumers find sexual stereotypes in advertising offensive to  women.  Not only that, but the federal Minister Reponsible for the Status of  Women, Marc Lalonde made a 17 page  speech about the problem of sexism in  advertising last year.  You have already indicated to us not  long ago, that you felt there wasn't  much that your department could do  about the problem. This seems incomprehensible.  If there is nothing  you can do under the present laws,  what are you doing to try and expand  them so they offer female consumers  freedom from sexist prejudice in the  sales techniques of advertisers?  Karen Richardson, VSW  NO COMMCNT  The METROPOLITAN HEALTH SERVICE  OF GREATER VANCOUVER publishes  a pamphlet entitled, The 5 to 6  Year Old, which explains:  "Boys now begin to develop interests  we think of as boyish and enjoy  male companionship. Girls begin  to enjoy things like painting and  sewing and other feminine interests."  Illustrations in the pamphlet  depict a boy painting a wall and-  driving a nail into a box. The  girl is putting her dolly to bed.  (Naomi Lis, of Richmond's  Women's Centre, drew our attention  to this gem.)

S€XIST ADVERTISING:  TH€ BUCK STOPS AT MAIR  Dear Ms. Richardson:  Thank you very much for your letter  of September 24 last.  The purpose of our General Advertising Guidelines is to present to  advertisers our interpretation of  the statutes we administer that  relate to the advertising field. In  other words, we are trying to interpret the Trade Practices Act and  the Consumer Protection Act so that  advertisers will know our basic  views on what does and does not  contravene the laws we administer.  The fact that we do not address ourselves to the presence or absence  of sexism in advertising is not in  any way intended to minimize this  problem. We simply are not the  appropriate department to comment  upon human rights legislation.  I am sure that an excellent case can  be made out for the proposition that  the Human Rights Commission ought to  make their views on sexism in advertising known to advertisers by giving their interpretation of human  rights legislation.  If I were to do so, I would be stepping well outside the bounds of my  portfolio and would be very much  interfering with the responsibilities  and duties of others.  Yours sincerely,  K. Rafe Mair  Minister of Consumer Services  Dear Editor:  The Honourable Rafe Mair, Minister  of Consumer Affairs, says he cannot  exceed the bounds of his authority  to prohibit sex discrimination in  advertising, through the General  Advertising Guidelines, published  by his department under the Trade  Practises Act.  That was the whole point of our  original letter. There is no law  in B.C, or in Canada, not even  the Human Rights Act, to which  Mair refers us, that prohibits  sexism in advertising.  If, as he maintains, Mair is  seriously in favour of feminist  principles, there is nothing stopping him from introducing a bill,  as a member of the B.C. legislature,  which, if passed, would give his,  or another department, jurisdiction  over this problem.  We already have guidelines on  children's advertising and laws  that prohibit racist hate mail.  We think that as Minister of Consumer Affairs, he has the responsibility to provide some leadership on this matter. Mr.Mair controls advertising, not the B.C,  Human Rights Commission.  If, for instance, we ask Mr.Mair  to introduce legislation prohibiting sex discrimination in credit, a  bill which is long overdue, will  he pass the buck once again by  referring us to the Department of  Economic Development?  Karen Richardson, Status of Women.  RAF€MAIR,R€LUCTANT  TOST€POUTSID€  HIS PORTFOLIO  Write to Rafe Mair, Minister of  of Consumer and Corporate Affairs,  Parliament Buildings, Victoria, B.C.,  and encourage him to do some  stepping out... VSW  OFFICE  IN  ACTION  OMBUDSCRVICC  The Ombudservice provides  direct counselling services for  women, speaks to the injustices  raised by the specific complaints, and makes presentations  on various aspects of the law  and how it affects women to a  variety of groups. Our members  have many talents which could be  used to support and improve  this service and increase  our visibility in the community.  This is just a short list of  areas where you could help.  YOURH€LPISN€€DED  INDIVIDUAL CLIENT SUPPORT  Family law proceedings or hassles  with bureaucracies are often  time consuming, frustrating,  emotionally draining and lonely  experiences for the women who  seek our assistance.  Because  of the heavy case load, it is  often difficult to give these  people the kind of support they  need to make it through the  long haul with as little trauma  as possible.  I would like to  develop a group of members,  each of whom would be willing to  provide this support to one  client.  Some clients would merely  need regular phone contact, a  sympathetic listener, others  might wish you to attend court  hearings with them or provide  support when they have interviews or  appointments. Hopefully in the  future, we will be able to ask  the women who received this assistance to provide the same kind of  support for future clients.  RESEARCH  Particular greivances often identify universal problems. To make  constructive criticism and alternative proposals requires time to  discover what the law is now, how  it is applied, what has been done to  improve legislation in other jurisdictions. Legal research requires  curiosity, some mobility and a  complusion for detail and accuracy. We have lots of "how to"  and resource pamphlets in this  office and "there are all kinds  of areas that need looking into.  BACK UP  We would welcome members to assist  both in the office and at speaking  engagements. I am sure many members have expertise in specific  areas that we could draw upon  for particular cases and presentations. (Some of these areas-were  identified in your responses to  the questionnaire)  OMBUDS TRAINING  For those members who are interested, we are planning a six-week  course to be held on Monday nights,  starting January 17th, '76. Sessions  are planned on interviewing; counselling; research; brief-writing  and advocacy techniques. The only  condition attached to taking this  course is a commitment to get  some work done for the organization.  So, if you are interested, get  in touch with Susan Hoeppner at  the office, and sign up now. If  you have any other ideas on how  the Ombudservice could provide  better services, please let  Ombudsperson Carol Pfeifer know.  Call VSW 736 3746  MCMBCRSHIP  We have now formed a membership  committee, and the first meeting  of that committee was held on  Monday evening, November 15, in  the VSW office. We have found,  through processing the questionnaires that many of you answered  this summer, that seems to be 3  major areas of concern. These  areas are : affirmative action,  consciousness raising, and political  involvement.  If yon have indicated an interest in any of these  areas, you will be contacted within  the next few weeks and asked if  you are interested in becoming  involved in an action group. If  you did not fill out the questionnaire, but wish to become involved  in any of these areas, do not  hesitate to call the office and  submit your name. Ask for Susan  Hoeppner, There are also two groups  now in operation which would  welcome fresh input from member  ship. These are: the Woman Alive  Committee, which produces the  T.V. show for VSW on Community  10, and the Education Action  Group, which combats sexism in  schools.  Phone the office for  details about joining these groups,  and watch for the new groups  which will be commencing in  January.  The position of Membership Organizer was, of course, made possible  by a grant from Vancouver City Hall.  The outgoing city council voted  unaminiously to approve the grant  of $7,000 for a full-time coordinator  of membership activities for the  period November 1st - March 31st.
