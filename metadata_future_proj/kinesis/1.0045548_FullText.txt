Spring, a new fiscal year and a larger and  better office!  Thanks to your constant support, Vancouver  Status of Women has been funded for one  more year by the provincial government.  Quite mysteriously, we have been turned  over from the ministry of the provincial  secretary to the attorney general's department. We will be seeking clarification  from the A-G's end as to what their expectations are about our future.  The grant is the same this year as it was  last year: $86,500. No COLA, no percentage  increases, nothing. We know you can figure  out for yourselves, the same each year  means less. And less.  On to the more upbeat news: the offices  at 400A West 5th are almost twice as big  as the cramped space at 1090 West 7th. We  now have two big meeting rooms (one for  smokers, one for the healthy). We hope  that these will be of use to everyone in  the women's movement. We also hope that  the extra space will enable us to expand  our programming considerably.  Our library resources are much more accessible here, with plenty of quiet places  to read and work with them.  Come to our open house on May 22 and see  for yourself.  June 24 is the date of our annual general  meeting, and nominations are now being  taken for the VSW executive, 1981-2. If  you are interested in contributing your  energies, call us at 873-1427.  Office hours are  Monday through Wednesday  9 to 5:30,  Thursday 9 to 9.  At our old offices on 1090 West 7th  summer of '79. That's Gillian Marie  writing and Joey Thompson typing.  On Friday, May 22, Vancouver Status of Women invites you to a  House Warming  at our new offices, 400A West 5th Ave. (5th & Yukon)  3:00-7:00 p.m.  Come and meet members, staff and executive.

We'll have the munchies, coffee and good cheer  City maintains old heights in  firefighter discrimination  On April 2 Vancouver city council voted to  retain its discriminatory regulations concerning height requirements for this city's  firefighters. Only the three Committee  of Progressive Electors alderpersons —  Bruce Eriksen, Harry Rankin and Bruce  Yorke — voted to do away with the height  restrictions.  Way back in 1978 before her job was axed,  Shelagh Day, the equal opportunities  officer at city hall, reported that the  fire department's height requirements  discriminated against racial minorities  and women.  After much controversy a $20,000 six-month  study was conducted by the Simon Fraser  University's Institute for Human Performance along with an internal study group  from the city's personnel, health and fire  departments.  They produced a 21-page report and short  film, recommending that the city retain the  fire department's regulation that firefighters must be between 5'9 and 6'2.  The main argument offered by the study is  that Vancouver fire department equipment is  already set up for firefighters in that  height range. The report could offer no  data linking accidents with height, although the film produced by the institute  showed a bunch of little males (no women)  falling over themselves in a Laurel-and-  Hardy effort to be clumsy around fire-  fighting equipment.  Could the firefighting equipment be modified? Do cities like Calgary, Edmonton,  and London, along with many in the States,  which have no height regulations, find  themselves incapable of fighting fires?  The report doesn't" say.  Human rights officer Alan McCann is not  impressed with the study, pointing out  that the recommendations are, in terms of  the B.C. human rights code, "still not  acceptable." In a letter to the city he  explains that "it's clear from a human  rights perspective that the ... requirement has a discriminatory impact on people  outside that height range, particularly  racial minorities and females."  Also unenthusiastic about the study is  Charles Paris, a consultant to the equal  opportunities program before it was axed.  "I think minds were made up long before  the actual study was made," he said,  adding that the recommendations would  certainly preserve the status quo. 0  Margaret Marsh given nominal  fine for midwife charge  Margaret Marsh, a former doctor, was convicted of practising midwifery in a  Victoria provincial court, but fined only  $10. since the judge ruled that she broke  the law "because of her kind nature".  Her defence lawyer claimed that she had  not breached the B.C. Medical Act because  the term "midwife" is not defined in the  Act, and she had not done it for gain or  reward.  Judge Gilbert Hogg ruled that Margaret  Marsh had been acting as a midwife because  what she'd done fitted the description he  had found in the Oxford English Dictionary  where "midwife" he told the court, was  one who practised the art of assisting in  childbirth.  Moreover, Hogg said, Marsh's actions fol  lowed the description of the duties of a  midwife as outlined by Karen May, a witness for the defence and an English-trained midwife.  The question of financial gain, Hogg decided, was irrelevant.  The trial is the first in B.C. history to  involve a charge of practising midwifery  and the decision leaves the way open for  future convictions under the Act.  The British Columbia Association of Mid-  wives (BCAM) comments, "a baby died in  this province for lack of midwifery skills;  not because of them. If the option of midwife-attended births had been available  in Canada, this unfortunate incident  might have been avoided."  Raises, not roses. You can  cancel that lunch, Mr. Board of  Trade  Raises not roses. That's what Canadian  secretaries want.  Donna King, president of the Vancouver  section of Professional Secretaries International (PSI), has announced that her  group will not be observing Secretaries  Week this year. -  Scheduled for the last week of April,  Secretaries Week, as King points out, has  traditionally provided an opportunity for  the media and the entertainment industry  to "treat us like a bunch of idiots with  their stupid contests." More to the point,  she says, would be a raise to cover a  recent rent increase or higher food costs.  Because of PSI's decision, the Vancouver  Board of Trade has cancelled its annual  lunch and seminar. Q OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HAZARDS  Learning about those sinister Video Display Terminal blues  By Mary Schendlinger  The Video Display Terminal (VTD) — a  keyboard, a computer, and a display screen  resembling a TV — has been around for a  few years. Maybe you have one at your  office or maybe you've just seen them.  The bank teller at your local bank might  work with one, or the clerk who takes  your air reservations, or newspaper reporters at the two major papers in town.  They used to be called CRTs (Cathode Ray  Tubes), but apparently this term wasn't  euphemistic enough. On April 11, Working  Women Unite and the Vancouver Women's  Health Collective led a workshop on VDTs  which gave participants a chance to find  out why a euphemism is needed.  VDTs are already used in many types of  office work, and their use increases daily.  But the machines have been developed and  pushed into use before the hazards to  workers have been fully tested or even  understood.  When the operator presses the keys on the  VDT, coded electronic messages are sent to  the back of the machine. From there, an  electronic gun sends electrons through a  cylinder and a series of deflecting plates,  and with the help of a scanner, the  electrons react with the phosphor-coated  screen to produce an image .— letters and  numbers.  Several health hazards presented by the  VDT are now being investigated. The most  alarming possibility is the risk of low  levels of non-ionizing radiation which can  be emitted from any part of any machine  at any time during its use. Very little  is known about the effects of these rays,  but there is evidence of radiation poisoning and links with birth defects in children of VDT workers.  The obvious first step is to get all machines tested carefully. So far, business  and government have moved slowly in this  area. At present, there isn't even a  reliable and thorough testing device for  most machines.  It's not just the radiation  And even if you're lucky enough to have a  machine without defects or leakage, there  are other risks.  People who spend hours a day working with  VDTs are reporting symptoms like tension,  irritability, dizziness, nausea, neck and  back pains, headaches, sore eyes, skin  rashes, short-sightedness, and cataracts.  Some of this may be a result of the general stress any office worker suffers. But  VDT workers' complaints are too numerous  and too similar to be coincidental.  And common sense tells us there is a  problem. The image on that screen is constantly moving, and flickering — sometimes imperceptibly. Those letters may  look like a steady light, but they are  actually fading" out and being rekindled  anywhere from 25 to 80 times per second.  As well, the image is a light one on a  dark background. The combination has to  be hard on the operator's eyes. And we  are just beginning to learn about "syste=  mic stress" — the harmful effect on a  personrs whole body from severe stress on  one system, e.g. the eyes.  The women attending the workshop did not  contradict these reports. In fact, they  embellished them. For example, a B.C.  Telephone directory assistance worker  described her experience of "blanking out"  . for several seconds during a work shift —  forgetting who she was, where she was, and  what she was doing. She reported the incident to a co-worker, who answered, "Oh yes,  now you are a real VDT worker."  And there are reports of one worker in a  room full of screens suddenly becoming ill  or starting to scream, and the reaction  spreading throughout the whole room.  Trade unions and other workers' associations have come up with ways to make your  workplace as safe as possible from these  health dangers, including lighting techniques, optimum work/break schedules, eye  tests, posture, office arrangements and  furniture.  For information on these, refer to the  February 1981 issue of Kinesis and write  to the Women's Health Collective.  And if'enough people put pressure on the  Radiation Protection Branch and the Occupational Environment Branch of. the B.C.  Health Department (Parliament Bldgs., Victoria, B.C.) those agencies may be moved  to develop radiation testing devices for  VDTs.  But even if all of these precautions are  agreed to and instituted by employers, even  if governments suddenly begin devoting  attention and money to proper testing procedures for VDTs and a close watch on the  factories that produce them, even then,  the implications of the VDT as a way of  office life are quite frightening.  Big Brother is three years early  The microprocessor — which is the building  block for VDTs, computerized supermarket  checkouts, transportation systems, etc. —  stores data such as letters, legal forms,  financial records, inventories, etc.  However, it also provides managers with  detailed information about the operator of  the machine: how efficient she is or isn't,  down to the number of key strokes she  uses to complete a task; when she's working and when she isn't. Literally every  move a worker makes can be, and in some  workplaces is, monitored.  Even in offices where workers are not under  constant surveillance, there are too many  reports of stress, fatigue, isolation, and  the sense that the woman is not really  doing enjoyable and fulfilling work, but  is merely an appendage of a machine.  We are watching hundreds of people (mainly  women in this case, as VDTs are office  equipment) lose their jobs or their skills  to machinery. Piece work,'shift work, and  part-time work are being implemented.  Training time is drastically shortened;  'the skills and experience needed to perform some tasks will steadily decrease.  After the workshop I, a typesetter, went  home and envisioned my job in 1990: my  hard-earned skills taken over by a very  complex computer which will work 24 hours  a day, which will never have to stay home  with a sick child, and which will be easily  programmed by an inexperienced and depressed worker who earns $2.00 an hour.  For a while I entertained the idea that  this vision is too paranoid, and that I  am'hopelessly old-fashioned.  But I'm not.  And neither are the people who sat with me  at the YWCA in April.  Technology, not technocracy  The face of office work, and many other  employment sectors, is changing rapidly.  This fact, all by itself, is not evil.  Technological advances make new things  possible, and help phase out repetitive,  routine work, and that's fine.  But it's not fine if we workers find our  work even more mechanical and boring,  and it's not fine if the technology becomes an excuse to relieve us of a living  wage and the benefits we need, and it is  not fine if we are dying of radiation  poisoning, and it is not fine if half of  us are put out of work.  Participants in the VDT workshop watched  a film that showed the silicon chip enabling a deaf man to hear, and a handicapped  person to drive a car.  It also showed a  neurosurgeon teaching his skills to a  computer, two word processors doing the  work of ten typists, and Swiss watch  factories closed down after the advent of  the digital clock.  So, while we can't stop technological  development and we probably shouldn't want  to, we must insist that this process not  happen for its own sake, that the implications of new ideas be explored before  they are allowed to proliferate willy-  nilly, and that the health of the earth  and the population be the first priorities  in research and marketing of new systems.  To date, trade unions are the principal  movers and' shakers in the drive to get  protection for VDT workers. Law suits  have been initiated; information is being  gathered; pressure is being brought to  bear on business and government.

Q  Ontario WCB denies cataract victim compensation  Darlene Weiss, employed by the Ministry of  Transportation and Communications in  Thunder Bay, Ontario, operated a VDT from  August 1978 to March 1980. She had an  eye examination before beginning to work  on the machines and had no problems at  that time. She now requires surgery for  removal of cataracts.  Last month, the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Board refused her claim because  medical evidence they had gathered showed  signs of cataracts in her eyes seven  years before she first worked with the  terminals. The case was the first of its  kind to come before the Board.  The Ontario Public Service Employees  Union is appealing the decision.  The union feels that the medical evidence  used to dismiss Weiss' claim is suspect  as the information collected by the union  from her doctor showed no evidence of  cataracts before she started working on  the terminals.  Weiss was examined by New York opthamolo-  gist Milton Zaret, who has been studying  the ocular effects of microwave radiation  since 1959. According to Zaret, Weiss'  condition indicates "radiant energy  cataracts caused by exposure to radiation  from VDTs".  0_  If you're pregnant and work at Bell Canada  you can now refuse to operate a VDT. You  can be transferred to another job without  a cut in pay.  This decision comes after negotions between the company and the Communications  Workers of Canada.  "For once, if we've  erred, we've erred on the side of safety,"  said Gary Cwitco, a union spokesperson. Q SURVIVAL  We united for survival, demanded that B.C. be nuclear-free  Some scenes from the Unite for Survival march and rally April 25.  Holding the Women Against Nuclear Technology banner in the bottom  picture is Krin Zook,  facing camera.   On the far left is another  WANT activist,  Annette Clough.  by Gayla Reid  April 25: International Day of Anti-Nuclear  Protest, organized here in Vancouver by the  Coalition for a Nuclear Free World.  The sun showed up. It was one of those  spring days when everything is as fresh as  sky and water.  Women Against Nuclear Technology had their  new banner out — made from sailcloth remnants in rainbow colours. Some of 2000  marchers were in costume. Some carried  tall bamboo poles with slender orange flags  to stream in the breeze.  Children first. Then Native people, followed by older people. Then women. Finally,  everyone else. Two, four, six, eight — we  don't want to radiate! From Kits beach  over Burrard bridge and down to English "  Bay for an array of songs and speeches.  Many of the singers are familiar to feminists: Eileen with Luna, Cherbeau, and more.  It felt particularly good to be walking  alongside such groups as the Voice of Women, women who've been working for peace  since the fifties.  Hard to believe, on such a bright day, that  our survival is threatened now as never  before. Dr Thomas Perry, from Physicians  for Social Responsibility, outlined a bleak  scenario.  He mentioned Trident, the nuclear submarine  base just south of the border. And the US  nuclear weapons at Comox airforce base on  Vancouver island, which make the lower mainland a target in the event of nuclear war.  Along with other Physicians for Social Responsibility — including Helen Caldicott —  Perry is determined to let governments  know that there is no possibility of dealing, medically, with a nuclear crisis.  Co-existence or no existence  There are no escapees. Even the elite, who  scurry down into their private shelters,  die from lack of oxygen (there were a few  scattered cheers at this point).  The choice, Perry concluded, is simple:  co-existence or no existence.  Nilak Butler, from the People Struggling  to be Free, described herself as a survivor of the 500-year war waged on the indigenous peoples of the western hemisphere.  The latest attacks upon the original people of this continent have been coming  from the mining companies who are taking  uranium off Native lands in the South West,  in the Dakotas and in Saskatchewan.  Survival gatherings held in South Dakota  July 1980 and in northern Saskatchewan  last October revealed the extent to which  the mining companies are prepared to go,  violating treaties and poisoning the land.  Here in B.C. the Nishga Indian people have  begun a battle with Amax, one of the largest multinational mining companies in the  world. As Jack Nichol, president of the  United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union  told the crowd, Amax has since last March  been dumping molybdenum tailings into  Alice Arm — the traditional fishing waters of the Nishga.  Now the fish will be flavoured with lead,  arsenic, zinc, mercury, copper, cadium  and radium.  Just as anti-nuclear work has become integral to the Native struggle, so too it has  become part of the feminist opposition to  the patriarchy.  Krin Zook of Women Against  Nuclear Technology explained to the gathering how we make the anti-nuke connection.  The same system that permits the rape of  women and young girls also allows Amax to  dump death into Alice Arm. The patriarchy  buys fighter planes and refuses to fund  daycare. It devalues nurturing and now, in  its ultimate expression, threatens the  future of our children and life on earth. Kinesis May '81  SURVIVAL  Taking a look at the deadly business of the nuclear arms race  Here's what the Coalition for a Nuclear  Free World had to say about some of the  basic nuclear issues:  Is there going to be a nuclear war?  Yes, unless we stop it. On August 6, 1980,  President Carter gave official sanction to  a long-time unofficial policy called first  strike capability.  First strike capability involves:  • cruise missiles which fly under radar and  are super accurate. These will be used  against Soviet missiles  • missiles with deep penetration war heads  which can destroy Moscow's command centres  • a projected 50$ of U.S. strategic warheads to be actively deployed on Trident  subs, making them invulnerable  • the unification of several anti-submarine  systems  • a revival of the anti ballistic missile  system  • the use of the space shuttle for a  communications war in space  • the continued production of neutron  bombs for use in Europe  Is a nuclear war more likely to be accidental  than deliberate?  Yes. for the following reasons:  • the proposed total automation of the  Early Warning System. This is necessary  as the attack times become shorter and  shorter  • the unreliability of the NORAD Early  Warning Computer System. There is so  much debris in space right now that NORAD  is unable to keep up. There are approximately 150 serious alerts at NORAD each  year  • submarine accidents. These were listed  recently as a result of the Japanese/American collision. American nuclear submarines have often collided with Russian  warships  The money required  to provide adequate  food, water, education,  health and housing  for everyone in the world  has been estimated  at $17 billion a year.  It is a huge sum of money  ...about as  much as  the world  spends on  arms every'  two weeks.  . the first strike capability of the U.S.  will mean that the Soviets will be trigger-  happy trying to protect their land-based  missiles. Less than 15$ of Soviet strategic warheads are actively deployed on  submarines.  Is Canada involved?  Canada is aligned with the U.S. by the  NORAD and NATO agreements. Military decisions are dictated to Canada by the U.S.  Canada acts as a buffer zone between  Russia and the States in the event of a  trans-polar strike, where missiles would  be detected and intercepted over Canadian  soil.  As a U.S. ally, Canada is a prime target  in the event of a nuclear war.  Litton is a U.S. company in Rexdale, Ont.  that produces the missile guides for the  new U.S. cruise missiles. The company,  although American, is subsidized with  Canadian tax-payers money.  Saskatchewan is soon to become one of the  world's largest uranium ore exporters.  Uranium ore, enriched, becomes the substance of nuclear weaponry.  Comox: nuclear warheads are at the Armed  Forces Base; warheads are also stationed  in Quebec  Trident: with over twenty nuclear missiles,  the submarines move in and out of Canadian  waters in the Strait of Juan de Fuca  Nanoose Bay on Vancouver Island: the bay  has the world's largest underwater  weapons testing facility plus facilities  for testing nuclear submarine radiation  leaks. Weapons tested and subs checked  are largely U.S. owned. The base is  thought to furnish Canada's principle contribution to NATO.  Canadian manufacturing and production is  ending up in nuclear weaponry.  Candu reactors are used in India to produce  high-grade plutonium for nuclear weapons.  What does the arms race do to us today?  The most obvious effect of the arms race  is double digit inflation. All arms  programs are unproductive. We have to  support every arms worker with our tax  dollars. Arms programs are paid for by  printing more money which decreases the  value of every dollar we hold in the bank.  High interest rates are also caused by arms  expenditures. All money invested in arms  capital is unavailable for investment in  other sectors of our economy. This creates  a shortage of investment capital.  This capital shortage means we cannot  invest in new products and new machinery.  This is the main reason for Japanese  success in our markets. They do not spend  their money on arms.  Cutbacks in health and social services are  also a result of the arms race. Both in  the U.S. and Britain arms are being paid  for with money that was to have been  spent on hospitals. Q  Simon Fraser plans to acquire Slowpoke— a nuclear reactor  Simon Fraser University wants to have a research-size nuclear reactor on its campus.  The Safe Low Power Kritical Experiment reactor — SLOWPOKE — would be used to analyze mine tailings.  SLOWPOKE is bad news.  Nothing about SLOWPOKE obviates the need  for all the deadly links in the nuclear  chain. You know what those are: the hazards  of mining uranium, on enriching it and of  transporting it. Then there are the problems of faulty reactor design and natural  hazards such as earthquakes.  An earthquake fault line runs under the SFU  campus on Burnaby Mountain. Recent volcanic  and earthquake activity indicate a shifting  of the geological structures of the west  coast. Remember, other man-made structures  declared "earth-quake proof" have not withstood seismic activity.  The research reactor at the Lawrence Liver-  more nuclear weapons lab in northern California — also built on a fault line - was  hit with an earthquake in January 1980.  A litre of water per minute contaminated  with radio-active tritium leaked from the  crippled reactor for at least a day before  workers arrived to clean up the site.  The proposed use of the SFU nuclear reactor  for the analysis of mine tailings is questionable in itself. Mine tailings have been  analyzed in the past without the benefit  of nuclear technology.

WHX. Rlfrtvr?  In addition to the dangers of exposing workers to radioactive contaminants, there's  the final problem: what do you do with all  this radioactive waste when you've finished with it?  The only approved dumping sites in Canada  are in Ontario. They don't take out-of-  province waste, thank you.  We know that UBC has, in the past, gone  ahead and dumped radioactive waste into  the ocean off the B.C. coast.  The Coalition for a Nuclear-Free World  sees SLOWPOKE as the thin end of the wedge  for introducing more nuclear activity  into B.C.  UBC also appears to be working towards a  greater involvement in nuclear-related  projects. TRIUMF, a research facility located on the UBC campus, ran a series of  ads in the local papers in October 1980  seeks physicists and technicians for work  in cyclotron, ion sources and isotope production.  In pointing to the dangers of nuclear activity, the coalition cites:  — the litany of nuclear power plant breakdowns  — the attempts of nuclear proponents and  nuclear regulatory commissions to cover up  defects and dangers inherent in nuclear  technology  — the violation of treaties signed with  the native people of North America in order  to gain access to mineral deposits to fuel  nuclear technology  — the proliferation of nuclear weapons  — and the shifting hands of the Bulletin  of the Atomic Scientists' nuclear doomsday  clock as world tension increases.    (J) LABOUR  How they won at Ken worth  CAIMAW activist describes equal pay for equal value victory  ByM  Jamie makes $5.57 per hour. Her husband  is unemployed. And there are two children to care for. Her rent is $350 a  month — the balance of her income is  needed for food, clothing and utilities.  Realizing she has no job security and that  she is the only wage earner, she is under  constant stress.  This was the story of one of our workers  before we organized at Canadian Kenworth.  There are many women in comparable or  worse circumstances which indicate the  importance of support for one another as  we struggle to remove the wage gap between  blue collar (mostly male)-and pink ghetto  (mostly female) workers.  We have won the right of equal pay for  equal work, and we will win the right of  equal pay for work of equal value by educating employers to recognize skill,  effort and responsibility and by putting  pressure on the government to change the  Human Rights Code.  Here is our success story:  In June of 1978 the Canadian Association  of Industrial and Mechanical Workers, or,  as it's commonly known, CAIMAW, acting  on requests from Kenworth office workers,  started a sign-up campaign to gain certification for these 100 workers.  CAIMAW is the union representing the 350  plant workers at Kenworth, only two of  whom are women.  Unfortunately the union did not achieve  overall majority status; however, all of  the Data Process workers signed up. Acting on our requests and in conjunction  with the Kenworth Plant Stewards Committee  the union applied in July of 1978 to vary  the existing certification to include the  seven data process workers.  On October 4,  1978, the Labour Relations  Board denied our application without  reason.  The union appealed because the decision  was a setback not only to the data process  workers but to unorganized workers in  general.  The Labour Relations Board then conducted  hearings on our application, reversed its  decision, and granted us certification on  February 27, 1979, seven months after the  original application.  The company insisted that terms and conditions of the existing collective agreement applied and that they would negotiate  wages only.  This meant the loss of paid maternity  leave, a 37i hour work week, paid sick  leave and a pension plan. The union insisted that if all other terms and  conditions apply, then so do wages.  The  company offered a starting rate of $6.92,  far below the production rate of $7.83,  despite the qualifications demanded by  the employer for data process workers  prior to hiring.  Data process workers require high school  graduation, supplemented by keypunch  training with two years related experience.  kft.  A    |j  Em    mm  G§r   L  Mf-Av  Production workers require mechanical  aptitude but often have no previous experience .  Unable to make the employer recognize the  work of data process workers as having  equal value to that of production workers,  the matter was submitted to arbitration  on May 19, 1979 as required by law.  Arbitrator Hugh Ladner delivered his  award on March 14, 1980 — ten months  later. He did this only after the total  union membership voted to withdraw their  labour for a day in protest of the slow  delivery of the data process arbitration  award!  In his award Ladner refused to do an internal comparison on the basis of skill,  effort and responsibility. The result was  a starting rate of $6.97 progressing to  $7.92 compared to production rates of  $7.83 to $9.71.  His position was five cents above the company's offer. I need not express our  feelings at this time. This was a major  setback to the concept of equal pay for  work of equal value.  On April 30, 1980 our contract expired.  We were in negotiations and continued  working without a contract, trying to reach  a settlement without a work stoppage.  On May 20th, a company offer of 10$ and  8% to all employees was rejected and the  strike began June 1.  Another offer of 125? and 8% was narrowly  rejected. It became evident at this time  that the most contentious issue was that  of equal pay for work of equal value.  The negotiating team (three male workers  and myself, none of whom were about to  bend on this issue) met with the company  saying we would recommend this offer if  the company would concede on the data  process issue. The company refused;  withdrew their offer completely and the  Equal pay for work of equal  value can only be won by  women and men organizing  and supporting each other  against the corporate giants  strike which was one of principle, continued for seven months.  On December 23, 1980, the membership voted  to accept an average of -44-. 2%  increase plus  added fringe benefits, one of which was  four extra statutory holidays for a total  of 16 and, most importantly, equal pay for  work of equal value for seven data process  workers, which meant these workers received  increases of up to 72.15..  Needless to say, our struggle achieved  substantial increases and benefits for the  unorganized workers at Kenworth.  It was only after we were involved in the  struggle at Kenworth that I found out that  my union, which is predominantly male, was  one of the first unions in Canada to embrace the policy of equal pay for work of  equal value.  That is the story of the fight for justice  for women workers won at Kenworth. There  are many such battles to fight. One example is the present struggle by CUPE and  other municipal unions.  These battles must,  can and will be won!  I am pleased to pledge CAIMAW support for  all such battles.  Equal pay for work of equal value is a principle which should be a right.  In reality  it can only be achieved by organizing and  supporting each other — women.and men  against corporate giants. Q  Civic strike: what happened to equal pay for equal work ?  Civic workers across the Lower Mainland  went back to work in the first week of May.  Equal pay for work of equal value, the  labour issue of the 1980s, had been one of  the key demands in the strike by over 9000  workers.  They held out for three months. They raised  the issue of equal pay for work of equal  value on a scale we'd never seen before in  B.C.  But the settlement was a disappointment.  The workers, unionized with the Canadian  Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the  Vancouver Municipal and Regional Employees  Union (VMREU) were demanding that the employer, the greater Vancouver regional district, equalize the base rates for inside  and outside workers. The lower-paid inside  workers are of course mainly women.  One union activist described the settlement to Kinesis in these terms: according  to the final offer from management before  v/ANCOUVOl MUNICIPAL* flIGSONAt  |  EMPLOYES VU\OU  the strike began, the inside workers would  on average have been making about $3.20  less than the outside workers.  After three months on the picket line, that  wage gap has been narrowed by four cents.  It comes out to slightly more than one  cent a month. Clearly, there is still a  long way to go.  And because the clerical adjustments were  received in a lump sum, rather than being  put into the wage rates as the unions had  demanded, the principle of equal pay for  work of equal value is one which will be  a struggle all over again, come next neg-  otion time.  Nonetheless, this was a historic strike. It  broke new ground in forcing public debate  around the equal value principle. We have  seen that both male and female workers are  | prepared to hold out for that principle,  ^ and that in itself will encourage other  !• unions to take up the battle. ACROSS CANADA  Almost equal pay is not equal:  commission appoints tribunal  The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC)  will appoint an independent tribunal to  examine a complaint relating to equal pay  for work of equal value. The complaint  affects more than 3,000 members of the  federal government's General Services category.  The decision to appoint a tribunal was  made when the CHRC, the Treasury Board (the  employer) and the Public Service Alliance  of Canada (PSAC), were unable to agree on  yet another settlement.  The 12,100 Government Services group has  seven sub-groups, each paid at different  rates. The three lowest paid — food,  laundry and miscellaneous personnel  services — are predominantly female. The  remaining four — messenger, custodial,  building and stores services — are  predominantly male.  Elizabeth Millar, a PSAC officer, had complained to the CHRC in December, 1979,  that the Treasury Board was contravening  Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights  Act, which makes it discriminatory to pay  different wages to men and women performing work of equal value. Treasury Board  acknowledged in May, 1980, that all  Government Services sub-groups perform  work of equal value.  In May, 1980, CHRC substantiated the complaint which it, the Treasury Board and  PSAC have attempted to resolve.  The latest Treasury Board proposal, rejected by both CHRC and PSAC, would have  increased female sub-groups pay rates by  the percentage difference between average  wages paid to the four male and three  female sub-groups.  The $13.6 million proposed settlement  would still have meant that different  rates would be paid for work of equal  value, leaving many women with lower  salaries than the men.  Chief Commissioner Gordon Fairweather  explained the CHRC's decision to appoint  a tribunal by saying: "The settlement of  this complaint must not dilute the principle of equal pay for work of equal  value. Equal must be equal, not almost  equal." 0_  (Clarion)  Woman takes first 'paternity'  leave in Canada  Charlotte Rochon, a member of CUPE Local  3012 in Saskatoon, has been awarded  "paternity" leave to share in the parenting  of her partner Marine's new son Daniel.

The report, based on a recent survey of  law graduates in Canada, found nearly four  out of every ten women lawyers seeking  jobs were asked objectionable questions at  their job interviews. Only one male lawyer in ten reported being asked questions  he considered offensive.  According to Marie Huxter, who is Assistant  Dean of Law at the University of Toronto,  women job-seekers were asked whether they  were lesbians, whether they wouldn't  rather stay home and "be happy", whether  they took birth control pills, and  what they would do if "our fattest,  richest client pinched your rear end?"  Says Huxter: "Those lawyers doing this  should be reminded that there is a code  of professional conduct governing them."  The survey was based on responses from  more than 3000 lawyers and law graduates.J  —Canadian University Press ACROSS B.C.  Women's Access conference stresses need for mutual support  By Gillian Marie  This year in Kamloops, International Women's Day was celebrated in great style.  The women on campus at Cariboo College  organized a conference on women and work  for two days, March 7 and 8, at the college.  The planning committee had anticipated an  attendance of about 60 women. To their delight, over 100 pre-registered and 120  showed up.  The conference theme was introduced on the  Friday evening by keynote speaker Jo Mitchell, a Vancouver economist who outlined  the disadvantages experienced by women in  the paid labour force.  Like many other single industry towns in  the interior of B.C., Kamloops has a high  unemployment rate. Women are one of the  hardest hit groups. When they do get work  it is, of course, paid far less than work  of equal value being performed by men.  With these as the material conditions for  working women in Kamloops, it's no suprise  that many women chose to attend the workshop on women in unions, facilitated by  four local union women.  Women joining unions at faster rate  Women, the workshop emphasized, are now  joining unions at a faster rate than men:  we need education about unions, both at  school and as we go on to the job. For mutual support, we need women's committees  within unions. And we need assertiveness  training courses to learn the skills necessary for full participation in all union  activities. Last but not least, we need  those union meetings to be held at times  when women with children can attend.  One workshop took a look at the impact of  the patriarchy on women's work, helping  participants develop an analytic framework.  The pros and cons of working within the  system were discussed.  Is volunteerism a negative or positive experience for women? Once you've got a job,  how to you stay with it, moving up the ladder? What problems arise for women at a  management level, where they are assessed  by fellow workers both as a woman and as a  manager? What can be done about sexual  harassment?  These issues were addressed in workshops,  prompting lively dialogue and discussion  by participants. Human rights officer Hanne  Jensen stressed that it is necessary to  report harassment and to identify it as a  problem. It's important, too, to document  carefully how the harassment occurred, and  when and where.  The economic, psychological and chemical  hazards of being a fulltime, unpaid worker  in the home were identified in a workshop  which analyzed housework as a female-ghet-  toed occupation. The same workshop examined legal avenues available to battered women, stressing the need for collective  action rather than individual "solutions",  such as tranquilizers and psychotherapy,  which simply perpetuate our isolation.  The special problems native women face were  discussed in a session entitled, "Native  Women Working for Native Women." In connection with the apprehension of children  it was pointed out that the residential  schools for native children — which operated until 1969 — has meant that three  generations of native women and men have  had no positive parenting role models. But  in recent years there has been a return  to traditional values, including a reassessment of the value placed on women and  their work. As one native woman quipped,  "We were liberated, then civilized...and  the matriarchy died."  Kate Braid from B.C. Women in Trades and  local tradeswomen hammered out some resolutions in a lively, energetic workshop.  There needs to be more counselling available for women going into trades, and more  At the Women in Unions workshop.

Women in  Trades — which support women in non-traditional jobs. Women go into the trades because the money is so much better. But we  go with our years of conditioning which  tell us we can't get our hands dirty.  The need for mutual support was likewise  the major theme to emerge from a workshop  on women in the professions.  Motherhood, not martyrdom was the subject  of the final workshop. Participants were  asked to list 20 things we liked doing.  And then we were asked to circle those we  had done at least twice in the last six  months. For many women who are fulltime  workers in their homes, this was indeed  an eye-opener as to how little time they  give themselves.  The conference ended in a plenary, with  thanks to Lynn Thomson and the advisory  committee to the women's access centre at  the college. The basic recommendation at  the plenary was that there should be more  conferences like this one, and soon. WOMEN WORKERS IN THE HOME  Mother's Day: why we're worth/^ so much more  By Gillian Marie  Mother's Day for me has always been the  day that we made mum breakfast in bed*  A usually poached egg on toast and invariably cold by the time she got to eat it,  and a cup of tea, also cold because when  we were really young we would forget to  warm the teapot). We would also buy her  something for herself, like bath salts that  she loved in her bath water, and made  her smell sweet, like roses or carnations.  Today, many women find that mother's day  is just another day but with the added  duty work load of buying and cooking for  their mothers and grandmothers, and the  mothers and grandmothers of their husbands.  May 9 celebrations in Grandview park  This year, a group of women, Women Woricers  in the Home, are planning an event to take  place in Grandview Park (at Williams and  Commercial Drive), next to Britannia  Community Centre. Events will include  music, speakers, arts and crafts, and  booths. There will be booths from Family  Places around Vancouver, from the Japanese  women's group, Matsuri; an East Indian  women's group Mahila; a book booth from  the Vancouver Women's Bookstore, and other  women's groups. Speakers will address a  variety of topics from welfare rights to  immigrant women's concerns. Issues such  as wife battering and lesbian mothers'  legal and societal oppression will also be  discussed.  The hazards of being a mother in this  society are numerous and because the work  that we do for our families is often taken  for granted, these hazards are invisible.  Myth: we make work for ourselves  A modern myth concerning women who work in  the home is that we have it easy — that  the work that we do is made easy because  of new technological innovations. Another  myth is that women in the home make work  for themselves, and that if they were only  "more efficient" they would be able to  get the job done in half the time.  This'myth is based on an inadequate understanding of what our work really entails.  It is also based on a faulty comparison.  Normally what is implied, or actually  follows this myth, is how much work their  mother or grandmother had to do and what  a hard life they had in comparison with  your own. It is true that we no longer  do many of the tasks that our grandmothers  did (such as making soap, butter, etc. )  But men working in paid work also no  longer do tasks that their fathers and  grandfathers did. No-one makes this faulty  comparison with "men's work".  The type of work that we do in the home  has changed. We produce fewer products  for our work hours. We are still responsible for maintaining the household, for  childbearing and child rearing, producing  a nurturing environment for the emotional  and physical wellbeing of the paid male  worker, housework, and managing the wages  earned (making ends meet, which takes more  and more time as inflation eats up the  wages earned). Women today spend approximately 73 hours a week on work in the  home, a figure that has not changed since  19-45. These hours are not absorbed by  husbands of women working outside the home  so that these women work the double day  shift.  For all of this work we receive no pay, no  vacations and no guarantees of an old age  free of poverty after a full life of essential work.  We are making changes in our lives  These are some of the issues that we will  speak out about at this year's Mother's  Day. We are making changes in our lives,  fighting those forms of oppression that  cripple us. Transition Houses exist for  women leaving intolerable living situations  »a*  WHAT WE'RE WORTH, IN  DOLLAR TERMS ALONE  In 1978, the Federal Advisory Council on the  Status of Women figured that the work that  we do in the home is valued at $26 billion or  27% of the gross national product. A U.S.  attorney has successfully argued that the  objective economic value (i.e. what it would  cost to hire someone to do the equivalent  work) of a housewife with two children is  $40,000 (U.S.) a year.  Food Buyer 3 hours a week, at $12.85 per hour.  Nurse: 1 hour a week, at $5.14 per hour.  Tutor: 2 hours a week, at $6.43 per hour.  Seamstress: 45 minutes a week, at $3.21 per  hour.  Waitress: 2.25 hours a week, at $5.14 per hour,  including tips.  Laundry Worker: 3 hours a week, at $3.21 per  hour.  Family Counselling: 2 hours a week, at  $45.00 per hour.  Maintenance Worker: 1 hour a week at $3.21  per hour.  Nanny: full time at a weekly rate of $149.  Cleaning Woman: 7.5 hours a week at $3.21  per hour.  Cook: 12 hours a week at $3.98 per hour.  Bookkeeper/Budget Manager: 3.5 hours a  week at $6.43 per hour.  Interior Decorator: 1 hour per week at $32 per  hour.  Child Psychologist: 5 hours a week at $40 per  hour.  Dishwasher 6.2 hours a week at $3.02 per hour.  Secretary: 2 hours a week at $4 per hour.  Public Relations/Hostess: 1 hour a week at  $20.00 per hour.  women on welfare are organizing to improve their living and working conditions;  grandmothers are organizing to improve  pension rights for women; and women in  unions are working to win contract clauses  that reflect the doublework load reality  of our lives.  More single mothers are able to keep  their children, raising them in both  traditional and non-traditional ways.  Women are fighting to win custody of  their children, no matter what their  sexual orientation. Women have rights  to half the family assets under the new  Family Relations Act.  Women are organizing, and our battle will  not be won until all women can live life  with dignity, free from economic, racial  and sexual oppression.  Domestic slavery is still in full  force throughout Canada  There are thousands of women still slaving  away in Canada today for as little as 75^  or $1 an hour. Domestic workers in eight  out of ten provinces aren't covered by  provincial minimum wage and hours of work  laws.  It was not until July 1980 that B.C. domestic workers won labour protection of the  most elementary kind, including coverage  under the Minimum Wage Act. More legislative changes are badly needed.  Only domestics in Quebec have full coverage under a law which was brought into  effect last spring, largely through the  work of the Montreal Household Workers'  Association. Domestics in Newfoundland  are guaranteed $1.58 an hour — half the  minimum wage all other workers earn. In  Ontario, domestics have just won the right  to vacations with pay and paid public  holidays, but are still excluded from the  hours of work and overtime pay provisions  of the Employment Standards Act, The  Labour Relations Act, and the Workers'  Compensation Act.  The Ontario Women's Bureau estimates that  there are up to 75,000 domestic workers in  Ontario alone. Most of them do day work  for $20-$30 a day. Hours of work and conditions of work vary from household to  household. Usually domestics are required  to clean a house at a set price, whether  it takes five hours or ten. Often it  boils down to a case of employers seeing  how much work they can get out of their  domestic for the least cost.  Conditions are even worse for live-in domestics. Canada Manpower has always had a  hard time finding enough domestic workers  to meet the demand. About 80% of domestic  workers are immigrant women who once they  are in Canada have no choice as to their  type of employment.  Until a few years ago, the federal government allowed women to immigrate to Canada  as domestics. Because no-one would work  for sach low wages for a day longer than it  took to find another job, this policy was  considered an unsatisfactory method of  obtaining cheap domestic labour. The  government changed the rules. Now they  "import" temporary workers (about 60,000  since 1973) who can work only as domestics,  for up to three years or so before they  are sent home again, with no right to stay  in Canada permanently. (Remember Daphne  Williams' story? See Kinesis, Dec-Jan)  When told about the exploitive conditions  these women work in, the federal governs"  ment says it can't do anything about it —  it's up to the provinces. The provinces  would rather keep salaries at the present  low level because it is cheaper to exploit  domestic workers than pay for good quality  daycare.

Phipps  Want to change the world but can't find  a babysitter?    When you're stuck at home,  do you think about all the other parents  in your community, also stuck at home  because they can 't find a babysitter? If  so,   this is your article.  A co-op is a group of families, usually  about 15-20, in a specific neighbourhood  or geographic area, who exchange babysitting services without financial payment. It is also a way of making new  friends for both parents and children.  It is not difficult to set up a babysitting co-op. The first step is to have  an organizational meeting with a group of  interested friends and neighbours. If  you don't have a core group you can advertise in a local paper, The Baby-Sitting  Directory, your community centre, etc.  This meeting is the place to discuss and  decide how your group will function. There  are various ways of running a baby-sitting  co-op. You will want to make decisions  about how to keep track of sitting time,  how a member will get a sitter, whose  house the sitting will be at, whether to  have an age limit, or a limit to family  size. A geographic boundary can be  decided on, the rules for taking in new  members, whether to elect an executive,  and a credit-debit limit.  A small fee may be decided on to pay for  paper and advertising costs. There are  various ways to set up your co-op; here  are a few guidelines used by co-ops in  the Lower Mainland. Adapt these guidelines to the needs of your co-op. A  number of meetings may be necessary, as a  co-op will evolve according to the needs  of its members.  Co-ops have regular meetings  All co-ops have regular meetings. These  are usually on a monthly basis. They  provide an opportunity for everyone to  meet and maintain contact. A number of  co-ops have evening meetings without the  children to discuss business or have a  speaker meeting. Some provide baby  sitters at their day meetings.  Getting involved initially  In some baby-sitting co-ops a prospective  member must be sponsored/introduced by  a member, in other co-ops a prospective  member can:  • attend a monthly meeting  • attend a monthly meeting, have a 3  month probation  • call the contact person who will  "arrange a neighbourhood coffee party  Keeping track of time, payments  Since no money is exchanged another form  of remuneration must be chosen, as well  as deciding the who and how of time  keeping. Either coupons worth 15-30  minutes of sitting time are used or a  point system with 15 minutes of sitting  worth one point. All co-ops limit the  amount of points or coupons a member may  accumulate.  In some baby-sitting co-ops a secretary is  chosen to keep track of the points or  coupons accumulated by all the members.  In some instances the secretary may arrange  the sitting. In all co-ops the job of  secretary is rotated and extra points are  earned for the job.  A co-op may chose to institute a payment  differential, for day and night sitting or  a penalty for cancellation.  Some child care reminders:  We would like to make all parents aware  of certain child rearing practices that  should be discussed between participants  in the program. This will help you find  more comfortable parents with whom you  may exchange.  Food:    Find out what foods are favourites  and what foods are not given to the  children. Discuss the use of pacifiers  and bottles. Also discuss times of meals,  and snacks, if allowed. Be especially  aware of food allergies.  Toilet Training:    Find out the stages of  toilet training, if any, for each others  children. What methods are used: is it  left for the child to decide when to go or  does s/he sit at regular intervals? Discuss the use of toilet training language.  Discipline:    Although this may be a difficult topic of discussion it is very important to find out the use of various discipline practices. For example, how and-  when is spanking is used? Are children  occupied with alternative activities or  given consequences to certain actions.  Discuss the amount of attention and freedom and responsibility given to the  children. Do they get attention whenever  they want it? Do they roam throughout the  house or are they given specific areas  for play? You may also find it necessary  to discuss the use of TV for entertainment.  Bedtime:    What hours does your child  keep? Does s/he have a nap every day?

Current attention to this case resulted in large part  from the public outcry aroused by the  members of CSCM, who spent the past year  speaking to churches, community groups,  lobbying for support and pressuring city  officials to investigate a possible connection between the murders. Not until a  year after the body of the first murdered  child was found would the Atlanta police  even admit a link among the cases. By  then, 9 of the 11 missing children had  been found dead.

The woman who brought the suit, Sandra  Bundy, has worked with the District of  Columbia Department of Corrections for  eight years. Four of her supervisors made  sexual advances to Bundy which she refused.  Following that, Bundy said, "I was denied  a promotion in 1975. Fellow co-workers  who had the same evaluation received their  promotions." Bundy linked the denied  promotion to the sexual harassment and  filed a suit against her employer.  A lower court ruled that although Bundy  was indeed sexually harassed, that alone  did not prove discrimination without conclusive evidence that her loss of promotion resulted from her rejection of sexual  advances.  Bundy then brought the case before the  United States Court of Appeals, which  decided that Bundy's employer violated  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court declared that as long as she  proved that the harassment had occurred,  she did not have to prove a direct link  between the harassment and her loss of  promotion.  "Having to work under those conditions  constituted illegal conditions of employment," said Arthur Chotin, Bundy's lawyer.  "Bundy's employers 'must publicly and  openly inform employees that this kind of  act is prohibited'," Chotin added.  The decision advocates guidelines set down  last November by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC), guidelines  which feminists consider very progressive.  The guidelines, which by themselves are  not legally binding, define sexual harassment as "unwanted sexual advances or  requests for sexual favours, and other  verbal or physical conduct of a sexual  nature ... when submission to such conduct  is made either explicitely or implicitely  a term or condition of an individual's  employment ..." or when the harassment  creates "... an intimidating, hostile or  offensive working environment."  Although the case did not receive a great  deal of publicity, "I have quite a bit of  support," Bundy said.  "The media was very,  very helpful." But while the case was  progressing, she did not receive the same  kind of support from her fellow employees.  "I work with six other women and 40 men.  I'm not in contact with women."  The women who were there were surprisingly  unsympathetic.  "I couldn't even talk to  anyone; even though these females would  complain, they stayed hushed." When Bundy  and her lawyer attempted to convince some  of them to assist her case, "No one wanted  to cooperate. Fear. They were afraid of  WORKIN' WOMEN  reprisal.  They thought I was just a  loser, I guess," Bundy said.  But Bundy feels that these sorts of cases  are now beginning to "come out of the  closet." She is very happy with the precedent that her case set.  "The court of  law consists of a majority of males," she  added.  "It's hard to trust any males.  When there's no protection, where do you  go?" o  Blue Shield strike pivotal for  future of female ghetto  organizing in San Francisco  Last December 1,100 members of San Francisco's Office and Professional Employees  Union, Local Three, went out on strike,  against the insurance company, Blue Shield  of California. Blue Shield workers are  almost entirely women, and over two-thirds  are minorities.  They're still out.  The Blue Shield strike is critical for the  future of clerical organizing in San  Francisco. The workforce is typical. But  because it's a union shop, the pay is  better than usual. The company is claiming  that union wages and workers' productivity  are the cause of their inability to process  Medicare claims competitively. Blue Shiel'..  is threatening to axe the union completely by moving out of the city.  The company has hired scabs at $1 an hour  more than regular workers, while holding  out for a contract that decreases cost  of living increases won by the union in  the past. The company's offer would also  eliminate not only some sick time protection, but pay increases for senior employees.  In addition, it is demanding 15  minutes more work each day for no extra  pay.  Blue Shield is also ignoring union demands  for contract guarantees to reduce health  risks for the operators of Video Display  Terminals (VDTs).  Barbara Pottgen, chief shop steward at Blue  Shield, notes that when VDTs came into the  office, staff who were previously required  to process 25-30 inquiries daily were expected to deal with 45.  In opposition to  VDT safety recommendations, those working  with VDTs got the same breaks as other  workers. Workers who could not keep up  with the quota were fired, despite seniority.  Other unions are supporting the strike and  threatening to switch or cancel their  Blue Shield subscriptions. National officers of the United Auto Workers have told  Blue Shield they'll cancel the UAW insurance contract if the company doesn't  settle fairly in San Francisco.  The best hope for the strikers is their  own solidarity — after three months, only  10$ have gone back in. And the strikers  have the overwhelming support of San  Francisco's ethnic neighbourhoods and  women's groups.  0  (Plexus/Union Wage)  No Guernica for the sexist  Spanish state, Picasso daughter  decides  Spain will either have to come up with a  divorce law, or lose its chance to get  back a famous Picasso painting.  The Madrid newspaper El Paris  is reporting  the Spanish government had hoped to display the late artist's famous work,  titled Guernica  at festivities to celebrate  the Cubist - artist's 100th birthday anniversary next fall. However, Picasso's  daughter, Maya Picasso, has decided otherwise.  The painting, Guernica,  depicts the bombing of a town in Northern Spain by Nazi  warplanes during the Spanish Civil War,  Picasso had reportedly stated that he  wanted it returned to Spain after "the  re-establishment of public liberties."  According to Maya Picasso, that time  hasn't come.

Robinson, Oklahoma City, OK 73109.  They're going all out for equal  pay in San Jose  For the first time ever in the U.S., civic  workers are all set to strike for equal  ^ay for work of equal value.  In San Jose, 2,000 city workers, unionized  with the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees, are geared  to go out May 9 unless the city agrees to  pay women as much as men for work of comparable value.  The union's own survey revealed that women  and men were paid unequally for comparable  work. That led to a $500,000 study by a  San Francisco firm of management consultants, which again verified that jobs of  equal worth done by women are paid consistently less than jobs done by men.

The  i"irst show is for. a mixed audience, the second for women  only. On Saturday morning she will give the opening talk  at Lesbian Conference 1981.  tobin Tyler hails from Winnipeg. She studied at the  (Manitoba Theatre Centre, then in New York at the Ameri-  3an Musical and Dramatic Academy. She worked in the East  as a singer and dancer.  3ne of Tyler's stories relates of being introduced to  Hew York show biz in I960 by being arrested along with  44 men for female impersonation, during a raid on a  irag queens' ball. As a result of that feat, she went on  to earn her living for a year as impersonator Stacey  Morgan.  From 1969 to 1978 she was part of a well known comedy  team with Pat Harrison. Harrison & Tyler are credited by  some as having invented a "new women's humour" by telling  jokes in which women were "the subject, not the object,  of the joke."  Wore recently, Robin Tyler has worked at organizing  concerts and music festivals for" women. She is an outspoken feminist and lesbian activist; a rousing political speaker with a great sense of humour. Be sure to  catch her at least once.

They're also doing gigs Wednesday, May 20 at the  Quadra; Thursday, May 21 in Victoria at the Ukrainian  Hall; and Saturday, May 23 in UBC's SUB Ballroom at a  benefit for Press Gang Publishers.  Mama Quilla II has played together since 1978. They're  named in honour of Toronto musician Sara Ellen Dunlop  (who called herself Mama Quilla), who in the '70s  opened new ground for women musicians through her performances and record company.  Many feminists see rock music as an art form which is  lost to women because of its rampant sexism in the  hands of men. But the women of Mama Quilla II don't  I                   feel that way.  They say that dismissing rock music out of hand ignores  the blues tradition that birthed it - a tradition in  which women like Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and Sippie  Wallace played a central role. So, don't miss this  band!

Members of the Lesbian Information Line  (LIL) may have run into discrimination on  the basis of sexual orientation from the  very agency they hoped would fund them to  combat it.  The department of the secretary of state's  women's program has turned down LIL's  modest proposal for a grant of $3500. The  B.C. Human Rights Commission has already  agreed to co-fund, alongside secretary of  state, and with a total budget of $7,750.,  LIL planned to produce a slide/sound  presentation aimed at countering stereotypes which form in large part the basis  of discrimination against lesbians.  As LIL spokesperson Dorrie Brannock says,  "We feel we have been discriminated against  on the basis of sexual orientation. When  we asked Stuart Clarke, the local assistant regional director at the department  of secretary of state, if his departmental  decision had been influenced by the fact  that we are a lesbian group, he replied  that he .'could not say it had not'."  The official rejection letter said that  LIL's application was turned down because  the project "does not fall within the  regional priorities of the women's program."  But the program objectives are as follows:  "To encourage the full integration of  women as citizens in Canadian society by  (l) increasing the capacity of women themselves to participate in all aspects of  society .r. "  Obviously, as LIL points out, if lesbian  mothers must fear the loss of custody of  their children, if lesbians are fired from  jobs, or are not hired, if lesbians are  fearful of discrimination — they are not  integrated.  Lesbians make up at least 1052 of the female population of Canada, and the problem  in dealing with a homophobic society can  no longer go unacknowledged. Write to  Francis Fox, Secretary of State, House of  Commons, Ottawa, and demand his response.Q  Say NO to war: women petition  for peace  The Women's Petition for Peace originated  in Denmark in February 1980. It was presented to the United Nations conference on  women last July with signatures of 500,000  Scandanavian women. Since then it has  been taken up by many countries.  The new goal is to present 500 million signatures to the second U.N. special session  on disarmament in 1982. The petition was  officially launched across Canada on this  year's IWD by the Voice of Women.  Part of the text reads, "We Canadian women  join our voices with the millions from all  over the world in this great chorus for  peace. We join with women all over the  world to say: we will no longer silently  accept this mad struggle of the superpowers  for superiority. We DEMAND disarmament  for a lasting world peace, an end to production of fissionable materials for nuclear weapons, and we demand that the billions spent on war be spent to improve  life on earth."  Say NO to war. Contact us at VSW and we  will send you some petitions to circulate  amongst all your friends. Our new phone  number is 873 1427.

The third and final part of WOMANSIZE:  Large Renderings of Women's Imagery is  three-dimensional. It opened Mayday and  runs until May 16.  Early in May, Womansize presents the Canadian premiere of the film, "Right out of  History: The Making of Judy Chicago's Dinner Party."  Two performances will celebrate the closing  of Womansize, Saturday May 16.  Diane Levings, a Vancouver-based singer,  will be performing a selection of her work  at 4:00 p.m. Says Diane, who plays guitar  to accompany herself, "I concentrate mainly on lyrics; what a song is saying is  very important to me. I guess you could  call it folk music.  I am a feminist and  my songs reflect that perspective."  At 7:00 p.m., the Black Arts Theatre will  perform Streetsuite. Especially developed  for Womansize, Streetsuite includes writings by Nikki Giovanni, Ntozake Shange and  Sonia Sanchez. It examines the realities  of being black, and a woman.  Streetsuite performers comment, "The piece  confronts some of the harsh aspects of our  daily experience — sexism and racism. We  as artists and victims dissect this reality; the better to understand it, more  knowledgeable to change it, and always the  ■more determined to survive it."  Both performances will take place in the  Women In Focus gallery, 456 West Broadway.  There is a suggested donation of $2 per  performance.  Women's Building plans AGM  for May 31  Dear Friends and Supporters:  We know it's been too long since we contacted you directly, but interim dates,  etc. are difficult to produce with  limited womanpower. The Planning Committee  has continued meeting biweekly for almost  two years now. Late summer and fall of  '79 were devoted to preparing a constitution that would satisfy the requirements  of the B.C. Society Act and still reflect  our primary aims and philosophy and later  that year we were officially recognized as  a non-profit society. We were then able  to apply for a federal tax exemption number which we expect to be forthcoming.  More than the first half of 1980 was spent  in producing several social and cultural  events: our first annual Valentine dance;  a concert variety show featuring local  artists; a dance concert featuring Wallflower Order from Oregon and a theater  group, Lilith, from San Francisco also  performed. While these events were well  received and attended, our net gains in  financial terms were quite modest; however,  we felt it was important that we keep the  name and concept of'the Women's Building  visible, as well as bringing women's  culture to our community.  The latter part of 1980 and this year has  been spent in attempting to work towards  some specific policies and philosophy that  we could present at our Annual General  Meeting as a basis of unity. We need your  input, ideas and energy, so if you are a  woman, nineteen years and over, please  attend our ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING on:  Sunday, May 31 from 1-5 p.m.  from 5-6 p.m. wine, cheese and  socializing  at  YWCA  Board Room  Child care will be provided, of course.

The feasibility study for Golden Spruce  concluded last fall. 1981 opened on a  tremendous high for Terrace women when  word came through that federal funds would  be available for the nursery.  Using the nursery as a base, Golden Spruce  will expand into other-areas of reforestation, such as cone collection, tree  planting, regeneration surveys and plantation maintenance.  The Ministry of Forests will provide the  initial 500,000 seedlings, and crew lists  of women are being drawn up.  Training programs are already underway.

MOVEMENT FORUM  Accountability—who is accountable and to whom?  By Cherbeau  Well now, here we go again. It is inevitable that various factions of this  community will not agree. Those wimmin  who are inclined to maintain heterosexual  and/or non-separatist consciousness and  life-style, appear to have some very strong  disagreeing reactions to separatist wimmin.  The wimmin of separatist consciousness,  faced with minimal support, have opted,  for various individual as well as political  and/or spiritual purposes, to remain apart  from male included communities as much as  is possible.  Nowhere for separatist sisters  I submit that there is no where for our  separatist sisters to feel comfortable,  barring of course, the occasional all-  wimmin's social function or the purged  energy pocket of their own homes. The  very presence of men within the wimmin's  community seems to escalate the dissention.  It's an age-old dynamic.  "Round and  round it goes and where it stops nobody  knows". Well, quite frankly, I'm beginning  to feel a little dizzy.  "In-movement" manipulation, cold shouldering and questionable priorities, iced,  of course, with a generous helping of  'therapy jargon', twisted loyalties, intimidations and hearsay, is a recipe that's  sure to give you heart trouble if you  swallow it.  However, there has been one truly great  happening in the midst of all this, and  that is the meetings of accountability.  The more recent ones to which I am referring are those of October 20th, November  11th, and December 8th of 1980.  A very large jar full of facts came out of  those meetings. There is still no change  in Rape Relief policies on men and funding.  There is, however, a continuing attempt to  present those policies through articles in  Kinesis, naming one, despite the general  consensus of the wimmin's community on  these issues. Well, if there is no end in  sight to this pseudo-remarkable volleyball  game of letters and articles, then it's  clearly time, I say, to take the dreaded  lid off the fact jar.  On October 20th, 1980, an overwhelming  cross-section of well over 100 wimmin of  the Vancouver wimmin's community (the  number had been approximated at 120) in  attendance at the first of the three  most recent accountability meetings voted  to reject the proposed agenda and method  of running the meeting. There were  changes made in the chairing and minute-  taking. Then a new agenda was drawn up  which pertained more to the issues that  the wimmin's community wanted to consider.  Those issues, the revised agenda, was as  follows:  • introduction  • strategy and tactics used to get us to  the meeting  • men working with Rape Relief  • a rapist working with Rape Relief  • fund-raising for the Rape Relief house  The first issue moved quickly, largely  consisting of clearing up fears, concerns,  misunderstandings and mounting hostilities  for diversified reasons (taking into  account, of course, the cross-section of  wimmin and their various reasons for being  there).  During the course of the next three episodes of this enlightening prime time  happening of emotions, politics, strategy  and confrontation much was learned.  Information and feelings were shared around  a rapist doing therapy with some sponsorship from Rape Relief and this male's involvement on the funding committee. The  issue broadened to encompass the general  issue of "Men Against Rape", so the name  goes, and whether or not the feminist  wimmin of this community considered it a  sound policy.  What were the majority's concerns? Rape  Relief, the wimmin's community agreed, is  a valuable resource, with a dedicated,  hard-working collective of wimmin who  provide excellent rape counselling service  and who have put out more than their share  of energy into de-escalating the daily  violence against wimmin.  It was also agreed, by a thin majority,  that Rape Relief would in future, as in  the past, be supported. A rapist, or any  man for that matter, working on committees  or doing therapy, etc. directly or indirectly connected with the Vancouver Rape  Relief collective under the auspices of  an "alliance" was not an acceptable policy  to the wimmin's community.  Rape Relief is a refuge on various levels  primarily for wimmin who have suffered  violence from men.  The request from the wimmin's community  for a change in Rape Relief's policy on  men was simply that.  In fact, after hours of information, misinformation and points of information, the  wimmin's community voted overwhelmingly  64$ to reject Rape Relief's policy on men.  There were 21$, a great number of whom  were Rape Relief collective members, in  favour, and 12$ abstained. There were  three or four wimmin, I noted, who did not  exercise their franchise in any direction.  Community rallied, bonded, decided  It is my personal feeling that when an  entire community spends precious energy to  rally and bond with the hopes of clearing  concerns around one of our more valuable  resources, then this community's consensus  should be validated with action.  But we're left with one last fact. So off  comes the lid — into the jar and pull out  a handful of 'House Funding' realities.  This is Rape Relief's vision:  • a 24-hour place, a house of refuge  • wimmin admitted regardless of age, race,  etc.  • wimmin define themselves as in need  • it will be a central place for political  action  • there will be a group interaction, not  just Individual  • the business office will be separate but  integral — somewhere on the grounds  • the house will be owned through a cooperative housing group  • will provide clear 'concretes' — food,  shelter and clothing  • will provide access to the tools for  control of our lives  • and most important of all — working to  self-sufficiency.  Rape Relief also wants a large house with  six bedrooms, an office space, twenty-  four hour availability, a fenced yard for  children, one on-call womyn at all times,  immediately available food, controlled by  house residents, Rape Relief, and no set  rules. Sounds wonderful!  But how is this much-needed house going to  be financed?  At present Rape Relief operates on funds  from the Attorney General, Ministry of  Human Resources and the Ministry of Health.  Funding comes to them through the Coalition of B.C. Rape Crisis Centres. However,  the decision seems to have been to go  ahead with the house unassisted by government funding. The Rape Relief funding  committee, as of December 8th 1980, had  $50,000 cash in CCEC, an "agreement from  a housing cooperative who will put up the  equity they have to guarantee a mortgage"  pending information on the operation of  the house and $300. in monthly 'pledges'.  So — but for the mortgage, fire renovation, landi,tax, hydro, heating, maintenance, food, supplies, wages, legal and a  medley of operating costs — it just might  work.  There are just two things left. These are  the moral questions, often left at the  centre of sagas such as these.  What about the existing Transition House,  its dedicated staff of wimmin, whose  knowledge and resources could have saved  us all a lot of trouble were they consulted, included and communicated with sooner?  Secondly, what about support for those  wimmin who have risked and spoken out on  these matters?  It's time, I say, to put the dreaded lid  back on the fact jar ... for now.  This is a certainty: not every womyn  agrees. But a majority have made their  concerns very clear.  Through the pain, hard work, and good intentions of every womyn who has suffered,  is suffering, or will suffer a struggle  in the present system, it is my sincere  wish that the crossroads do not continue  to divide us.  That compromise and action become a necessity for unity (along with a self-humbling  denial of our own personal beliefs) is a  difficult redirection of political movement often required when a community must  move as a whole and a minority must concede. Mutual respect for the majority  opinion in the matter is a support-inaction without which we will certainly  divide and/or loose a difficult-to-replace  resource. 0_  WOMEN AGAINST  IMPERIALISM  The next Women Against Imperialism workshop is May 24.

Press Gang shares some concerns  Dear People:  Recently at Press Gang we have felt disappointed and bothered by the number of  printing jobs we have seen around town  that are from groups which we consider our  allies, yet which where printed at commercial, profit-oriented print shops.  (At  the same time we would like to mention our  appreciation of those groups who consistently bring their work to us).  This letter is to explain more fully who  we are, how we operate and why it is in  the best interests of both you, as a  feminist, community or progressive political group, and us, a feminist political  press, that we print your work.  Who are we? Press Gang is a non-profit,  feminist printing and publishing collective established in the early seventies.  We are a political, community-oriented  press which means that we prefer to print  and publish material which promotes the  liberation of women and/or has an anti-  capitalist perspective. It also means  that we reject any work that is sexist or  racist.  We think it is important to have the means  to produce material which counters the  prevailing capitalist ideology which we  live under. Why do we think it important  to own our own presses? Given the limited  access of the women's movement and the left  to more sophisticated forms of mass communication such as TV, radio, and computers,  we are still largely reliant on printed  material for communication.  As times get rougher, as they show every  sign of doing, suppression of counter  ideologies will increase. The greater the  threat of suppression the greater will be  our need to not be silenced.  Having our own presses and the skills to  run them will be vital for us to maintain  communication and unity. Even now it is  useful to have the means to print 'instantly' notices and flyers exactly when we  want to; or to put priority or 'rush' on  work that is of a political nature we  support.  In order to survive within a capitalist  economy Press Gang needs to generate a  certain amount of income. The stronger  community base we are able to build, and  the more community-oriented work we do,  the less reliance we will have on commercial jobs for our existence.  We think there are both economic and political reasons for you to bring your work  to us.  Economic reasons to choose the Press  First, the economic reasons. Even though  Press Gang is a small operation hampered  by old machinery we can produce printed  material that compares favourably with  commercial print shops in terms of price,  speed and quality.  Recently a group, assuming we didn't do  'instant printing', took their work to a  specialty instant print shop and paid  twice as much than they would have been  charged at Press Gang on jobs we could have  offered equal quality on.  Though most  print shops are not generally this much  more expensive, this example illustrates  a difference in pricing policy than that  practiced at Press Gang.  Profit-oriented business will sometimes  use small jobs (500 or less) as 'lost  leaders' — they will under-charge on small  jobs in order to sock it to you on big  ones. At Press Gang we attempt to calculate accurately how long it takes us to  print a job and charge you accordingly.  There is not a great difference in set-up  time for 500 or 2,000 so the price per  copy is reduced quite a bit on a higher  quantity since the additional cost is  mostly for materials and longer running  time.  Besides fair pricing we also will consider  a reduction in labour costs for groups  that are in worse financial shape than we  are, as well as letting people use our  equipment for folding, layout, cutting  etc.  Often we can do same day service on small  'instant print' jobs but one way to  guarantee this is to phone us a few days  ahead to book time on the press.  If your considerations are only economical  (cheap, quick, convenient) we would like  you to at least check with us to find out  how we compare.  However, we consider ourselves more than  simply a regular print shop and it is for  this reason, primarily, that we are asking  for your support.  As already stated we price fairly and produce work that is of good quality and on  time. Occasionally our quotes will be  higher, this is due to the limitations of  a small operation. We do not have enough  purchasing power, i.e. capital, extended  credit terms, to buy large quantities of  supplies at reduced unit prices nor can  we afford faster or more efficient equipment .  If we operated from a profit motive we  would, for example: never donate our  labour, be willing to make money from all  kinds of jobs, not offer jobs to women  without experience, not allow time for  shared decision making, and charge every  time someone uses our equipment or we  help or give advice on layout or design.  All these and other reasons mean we are  generally struggling to break even. It  means we cannot afford to upgrade our  equipment when we need to, call in repair  people except as a last resort, or pay ourselves decent wages. So, in the long  term, if Press Gang is to survive as a  political press we do need your business  even though at times we may not be the  cheapest.  If we are more incovenient, not-just-  around- the-corner, or do not provide a  'free' delivery service (although often we  do deliver jobs on our way home from  meetings) we want you to consider the  long-term effects and still bring your  work to uis. And when the problem or mistake is with us we want you to let us know  about it so that we can work out solutions  together.  Besides being printers, we are also feminist publishers. We spend countless  hours with women writers and artists helping to publish non-sexist books, posters  and leaflets that would probably not get  produced anywhere else.  We are always trying to find ways to be  more politically effective or of more  use to feminist, anti-capitalist people.  For instance, we are planning to be open  Saturdays so we are more accessible to  customers and volunteers. We are planning  a workshop in conjunction with Makara, on  producing leaflets and posters that are  effective, beautiful and cheap as possible.  We are also planning to improve our  instant print system so that work with  solids and halftones will look better.  If you want more information or have  comments on this letter please phone us at  253-1224. And we hope in future that  more of the posters beautifying the telephone poles and store windows of Vancouver  and the flyers pressed into receptive hands  will have been printed by our receptive  "hands, on our presses, by our own labour . 0_  PRESS GANG  Benefit Dance  with  MAMA QUILLA II  (a fabulous women's band from Toronto)  SAT.

Nine wemoon formed  the initial venture (which later increased  to eleven wemoon) as a combination residence/sanctuary for its members.  The collective, early on, created an agreement which included having the land held  'in trust' for all of its members by one  member.  This legal agreement was designed  to protect the interests of all members and  to provide the flexibility for wemoon to  move in/out of the group without affecting  the land's deed of title. Initial work  was done to form a cooperative after we  studied various legal options, but this  re-vision was never actualized. The group  was/is, by its trust agreement, bound to  operate as a collective with decisions  made by consensus. All members of the  group had/have one vote, whatever financial  share of the land they own.  (Other wemoon forming groups for the  purpose of buying land for collective living might want to look at the trust agreement formed after consulting with other  wemoon's land collective agreements; we  know, now, that there were gaps in the  agreement, which is true of most innovative projects. We have suggestions for  modifications, after seeing it in action;  the concept we are always willing to  share.)  Over the last year, there has been considerable strife and anguish within the Rubyfruit collective. Hard work went into  conciliating the differences, but this was,  for the most part, unsuccessful in holding  the group together. In March, 1981, four  of the members agreed to purchase the  shares of all the other members.  It is the feeling of the present members  of Rubyfruit Ranch (II) that the issues  underlying the dissolution of the original  &*<*•*&*»**; fob. Wax,  tkuvioacn- tvUsk-  :  «J2:  j oe. »<C*2,V4Ml.QSrap<fcCM*&T  collective are not an isolated phenomenon  in the larger wemoon's "community".  Irreconcilable differences do arise among  wemoon who call themselves feminist  wemoon-centered-wemoon.  It's hardly a new  situation, sad and painful as that thought  is.  Conflict can pile up personal and collective garbage, or it can lead to growth  and stronger political and personal commit'  ments. Nurturing trust within collectives  whose members are so financially and  socially interdependent is scary, as well  as exciting. As wemoon dedicated to new  ways of sharing our lives and resources,  we know how our dreams come up against the  realities of all our threated/ing places.  We are sure too, that what we hope for  comes about only through the process of  shedding internalized and damaging myths  about ourselves as we travel what we say  is new territory without any road maps to  direct our way.  We hope to talk more, in future issues of  Kinesis, about the issues of power, misogyny, and other old baggage that we face  as we go about creating new models of  living for ourselves. We know that responsible communication is very important if  we are to strengthen each other's power,  rather than see other wemoon's power as  threatening our own. For this reason, we  hope that other wemoon will communicate  with us and with each other these vital  issues for healthy survival in an alienating world. Wemoon and children are  invited to share with us, via letters or  visits, and can contact us via Box 220,  Coombs, B.C., VOR 1M0.  We are also open  to discussion with wemoon who are looking  for wemoon's land, as we go about recreating Rubyfruit Ranch (II).

Twin Maples director takes issue  with Women in Prisons interview  Dear Kinesis:  Your article in March '81 edition of  Kinesis, "Women against Prison", contains*  some grossly incorrect statements.  I am disappointed that Kinesis which is  sponsored by Vancouver Status of Women, a  highly credible group, would allow unsigned  misinformation to be printed.  As Director of a women's prison I have a  keen interest in supporting enlightened  programs which further the understanding  of women's position in society and the  numerous problems we face.  Groups which offer programs beneficial to  incarcerated women have never been  "barred" from Twin Maples Correctional  Centre.  The group who chose not to identify themselves in your paper were not truthful in  their reporting. The facts are:  • their personal appearance and their presentation of material did not appeal to  the women they were trying to reach  • the supercilious attitude of some members of the visiting group did not reflect openness or cooperation.  • routine rules and regulations which  govern any organization were misinterpreted by them as personal discrimination and seen as resistance to tXeir  group.  I recommend that each individual in that  group, in the interest of advancing the  progress of women, remove their prejudicial blinders and take their own personal  inventory before they label and condemn  other persons.  We at Twin Maples are receptive to constructive programs that attempt to light  the way for the women in our care.  If this group has any integrity I trust  they will retract their incorrect statements and tell it as it really is.  P. Drew, Local Director,  Twin Maples Correctional Centre.  Tell Me a Riddle: we need this  film to come back to town  "Tell Me a Riddle"; directed by Lee Grant;  screenplay written by Joyce Eliason and  Alec Little; produced by Godmother Productions. From the story byTillieOlsen.  This film has been reviewed and written  about in various women's publications in  the past few months. The reviewer's  closing remark in an article in Afe. magazine March/81 issue was: "Sensitive, sure  and poignant, it's the best film I've seen  in years." A fairly strong comment for a  reviewer to make.  I agree with her, and probably so do most  of the "handful" of people who were fortunate enough to catch this film in its  all-too-brief (6 day) run in Vancouver  earlier this month. This film, written,  produced and directed by women is truly  one of the important ones: rare and beautiful, a film about life, death, love and  strength between a very old Russian immigrant couple and their children and grandchildren; especially their granddaughter  in San Francisco. The strength and determination of the women in this film is  superbly carried out as a primary theme,  portraying women's strength over several  generations in a family.  I had heard about the film and read about  it for several months, and T was delighted  when it finally hit Vancouver. But "Tell  Me a Riddle" was a victim of unfortunate,  circumstances.  It opened at the Capitol  6 a few days before the Academy Awards. It  should have run at a less commercial type  of cinema. It was very poorly advertised,  indeed, the ad which was run in the paper  indicated nothing about the film. In fact,  the ad made it sound like a soap opera,  overly sentimental and trite.  After seeing the film I called the reviewer at one of the local newspapers, informed  him as to what an excellent film this was  and urged him strongly to review it. He  said he'd already heard very good things  about this film and wanted very much to  review it, and he would have, except it  was gone the day after I talked to him,  'replaced by Oscar winners and contenders.  I am really angry that a film of this  calibre wasn't given half a chance in this  city, I know  that it would, have been  praised to the skies if only it had played  at the right theatre at the right time.  It's an important film for us, and we must  try and get it back to Vancouver somehow.
